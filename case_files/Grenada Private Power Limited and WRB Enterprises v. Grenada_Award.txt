OVERVIEW

Grenada Electricity Services Company Limited (“GRENLEC” or the “Company’’) is the
sole electric utility in Grenada, a country comprised of the main island of Grenada and the

adjacent islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique, in the Eastern Caribbean.

Grenada achieved independence from Britain in 1979. Over the next 15 years, GRENLEC,
then publicly owned, was chronically underfunded and its service characterized by
electricity shortages. In 1992, the Government of Grenada (“GOG”, the “Government”
or the “Respondent”) was advised by the World Bank and others to privatize the utility.
The then party in power, the National Democratic Congress (“NDC”) embraced the
recommendation. The main party then in opposition, the New National Party (“NNP”)
opposed it. This political rivalry played out over the next 20 years and provides essential

background to many of the events that led to the current dispute.

Eventually, in 1994, the NDC government sold a controlling interest in GRENLEC to
Grenada Private Power Ltd. (“GPP”), a Grenadian company in which WRB Enterprises
Inc. (“WRB”), a closely held private company based in Tampa, Florida, United States of
America, indirectly holds 75% of the shares (GPP and WRB, jointly, the “Claimants”).
The privatization package included a Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) dated 14
September 1994, signed between the Respondent and the Claimants, that was made
conditional upon the GOG enacting a favourable regulatory structure in the 1994 Energy
Supply Act (“1994 ESA”) and the 1994 Public Utilities Commission Act (“PUCA”). The
SPA specifically provided that upon the happening of any one of the “Repurchase Events”,
the Claimants would have the right to “put” their shares to the GOG, and the GOG would
be obliged to repurchase them at a price calculated in accordance with the Second Schedule

of the 1994 ESA (“Second Schedule”).

Twenty-two years later, the incoming NNP Government decided to restructure the
electricity sector through sweeping changes to its regulation, production and distribution.
The result, the Claimants say, was to trigger an obligation on the part of GOG to repurchase

the Claimants’ shares in GRENLEC.

-8-

On 22 March 2017, the Claimants “put” their GRENLEC shares to the GOG for

repurchase, claiming compensation of EC $182,100,000 or EC $19 per share, pursuant to

the statutory valuation formula in the Second Schedule. Following unsuccessful attempts

to negotiate a solution, the GOG declared its rejection of any obligation to repurchase the

shares and refused to pay the claim. Hence this arbitration.

The principal issues are as follows:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the Respondent says that its repurchase obligation is “void and unenforceable”
under Grenadian law. The Claimants counter that the SPA is governed by
international law and, by its own terms, expressly excludes rules of Grenadian law
inconsistent with the repurchase obligation. Moreover, the GOG is estopped by its
words and conduct over the years from challenging the validity of the repurchase

provisions;

the Respondent argues that the SPA repurchase obligation constitutes a penalty
under Grenadian law, which renders it unenforceable, and in any event, the
repurchase provisions are void as unconstitutional because their effect (and perhaps
intent) is to fetter the authority of the GOG to regulate the electricity sector in the
public interest. The Claimants respond that the repurchase obligation is neither a

penalty nor unconstitutional

the Claimants argue that in 1994, the GOG was expertly advised by Price
Waterhouse (“PwC” for both Price Waterhouse and PricewaterhouseCoopers)
whose consultants analysed the bidding process, the evolution of the bids and the
statutory formula and declared the transaction to be appropriate and fair. The
Respondent disputes the degree of PwC participation and states that the
Government representatives, including Ministers, lacked relevant experience, and

did not adequately protect Grenada’s interest;

the Respondent says that the Claimants committed “wilful malfeasance” in their
management of GRENLEC which (under the express terms of the SPA) disentitles

the Claimants from insisting on the GOG repurchase of the Claimants’ shares. The

-9-

Claimants dispute the “baseless” allegations of “wilful malfeasance” and state that,
in any event, the GOG cannot rely on that defence because the SPA explicitly
requires an ICSID declaratory order to that effect be obtained prior to the GOG

taking an action that would otherwise trigger the repurchase demand;

(e) the Respondent says that the repurchase price payable under the SPA should be
limited to fair market value determined by Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”)
methodology rather than pursuant to the formula in the Second Schedule of the
1994 ESA, which is a bizarre formula inherited from the colonial past. Its
application would produce compensation “extravagantly disproportionate” to the
actual fair market value of the shares. The Claimants say that while the Second
Schedule was rooted in a pre-independence Ordinance of 1960, it was given fresh
life by the Government itself and inserted at the GOG’s insistence into the 1994
privatization. The Claimants say they are entitled to the specific performance of

the agreed bargain;

(f) the Respondent says that any award to the Claimants must be offset by the amount
of its counterclaim. The Claimants respond that the counterclaim is “fabricated”
for strategic reasons and is so frivolous that the Respondent has never even bothered

to quantify it.

Fundamentally, the Parties clash over the proper characterization of the GRENLEC
investment. The Claimants consider it a straight forward commercial investment whose
terms were fairly negotiated and which the Claimants are entitled to enforce. If the
Claimants are now entitled to compensation in excess of fair market value (which
overpayment is denied), so be it. A deal is a deal. The Claimants say their stewardship of
GRENLEC has benefited Grenada and they are entitled to their entitlements. The
Respondent NNP Government, on the other hand, considers the Claimants to have been
poor corporate citizens. The Claimants sought at all times to maximize their return on
investment with little regard for meeting GRENLEC’s capital investment needs or the well-
being of the island economy (including, in particular, the Claimants’ persistent failure to

develop Grenada’s ample renewable energy resources).

-10-

In the Tribunal’s view, it has no authority to judge whether or not in the period 1994 to
2016, the Claimants caused GRENLEC to behave as a good “corporate citizen” of Grenada.
The task of the Tribunal is to determine whether the complex contractual arrangements

between the Parties have been complied with and, if not, what remedy should be awarded.

The Tribunal has concluded that neither the SPA (nor the Supplementary SPA)
unconstitutionally fettered Government action. When the NNP party returned to
Government in 2014, it was clearly not deterred in any way from enacting the 2016

restructuring legislation.

The primary relief sought by the Claimants is, in effect, for specific performance of a “put”
contract to repurchase the GRENLEC shares. In the Claimants’ prayer for relief, the
Claimants distinguished between compensation claimed by way of specific performance

EC $182,150,000 or damages in an equivalent amount plus costs.

The main difficulty confronting the Respondent was not so much that the Government
lacked legal arguments (on which point the Respondent was very creative) as it was the
lack of factual evidence necessary to sustain the legal arguments that were put forward with

considerable gusto.

In the Tribunal’s view, for the reasons which follow, the Claimants are entitled to succeed
albeit with somewhat less compensation than they are demanding. The SPA is valid. There
is no penalty. The terms are not contrary to the Constitution of Grenada. The Respondent
has not established either the procedural condition precedent or the substantive factual
prerequisites to deny the Claimants compensation on the basis of “wilful malfeasance”.
The Claimants have established a “repurchase” event which requires the Respondent to
pay compensation at the level agreed to in the Second Schedule. Accordingly, the Tribunal
awards the Claimants Second Schedule compensation but calculated in a way that pays due
regard to the differences of opinion among the quantum experts. The Claimants are also

entitled to pre and post-Award interest and costs.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 5 May 2017, ICSID received a request for arbitration from Grenada Private Power

Limited and WRB Enterprises, Inc. against Grenada (the “Request”).

On 15 May 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In
the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute
an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of

Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

The Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the
ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be
appointed by each Party and the third, the presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by

agreement of the Parties.

The Tribunal is composed of Hon. Jan Binnie, C.C., Q.C., a national of Canada, President,
appointed by agreement of the Parties; Mr. Richard Boulton, Q.C., a national of the United
Kingdom, appointed by the Claimants; and Ms. Olufunke Adekoya SAN, a national of the
United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Nigeria, appointed by the Respondent.

On 9 November 2017, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID
Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), notified the
Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was
therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Jara Minguez Almeida, ICSID

Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the

Parties on 5 January 2018 by teleconference.

Following the first session, on 24 January 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1
recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1
provides, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from

10 April 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of

proceedings would be St. George’s, Grenada. Procedural Order No. | also sets out a

schedule for the merits phase of the proceedings.

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, the Claimants filed a Memorial on the Merits

dated 1 March 2018, including:

- Witness Statement of Mr. G. Robert Blanchard, Jr., dated 1 March 2018;

- Expert Report by Mr. John MH Ellison and Mr. Thomas Popovic, dated 1 March
2018, with Appendices | through 13, and Exhibits JETP-01 through JETP-49;

- Exhibits CE-0001 through CE-0055; and
- Legal Authorities CLA-0001 through CL-0028.

On 11 June 2018, the Claimants filed the Request for Provisional Measure to restrain the
Respondent from directly or indirectly using its regulatory powers to “obtain discovery
outside the agreed arbitral process [provided for in Article 15 of] Procedural Order No.
1.”! According to the Claimants, the Respondent’s demand [purportedly as a regulator] for
“a massive amount of information”? “outside of the agreed arbitral process”? for document
production, was “abusing its regulatory powers in an effort ... [to] gain an unfair advantage
in this arbitration”* which “threatens the level playing field... and undermines the integrity
of these proceedings.”° The Request for Provisional Measure was accompanied by Exhibits
CE-0056 through CE-0061, Legal Authorities CLA-0029 through CLA-0048 and
CER-0001.

In response to the Tribunal’s invitation, the Respondent filed observations on the
Claimants’ Request for Provisional Measure on 22 June 2018, opposing the Claimants’

request.°

- Witness Statement of Mr. Chester Palmer dated 28 June 2018;

- Witness Statement of Mr. John Auguste dated 28 June 2018;

- Witness Statement of Minister Gregory Bowen dated 28 June 2018;

On 20 July 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the Claimants’
Request for Provisional Measure, which directed that the order against enforcement of the
Minister’s 9 May 2018 request would continue in effect until 2 November 2018 unless sooner
extended or varied by the Tribunal. This Order also set out a timetable for the Respondent to
make a “substantive reply” and for the Claimants to file a rejoinder, without disrupting the

existing procedural timetable.

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, on 3 August 2018, the Respondent filed the
Opposition to the Claimants’ Request for Provisional Measure, including Exhibits

RE-0120 through RE-0133 and Legal Authorities RLA-0065 through RLA-0076.

On 26 September 2018, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Provisional Measures, which
forms part of this Award.’ The Tribunal recommended by way of Provisional Measure that
the Government defer the date for compliance with the Minister’s letter of 9 May 2018
until 30 March 2019, and that in the meantime, the Claimants are not to be considered in

default of their informational obligations under the Electricity Supply Act 2016.
On 29 November 2018, the Claimants filed a Reply Memorial, including:

- Reply Expert Report of Mr. John MH Ellison FCA FSSBV MEWI dated 29
November 2018 with Exhibits JE-0001 through JE-0016;

- Second Witness Statement of Mr. G. Robert Blanchard, Jr. dated 29 November
2018;

- Witness Statement of Mr. Robert Blenker dated 29 November 2018;
- Exhibits CE-0026 (resubmitted) and CE-0064 through CE-0207; and

- Legal Authorities CLA-0061 through CLA-0132 as well as resubmitted Legal
Authorities CLA-0025 and CLA-0050.

By letter dated 14 January 2019, the Claimants sought an order from the Tribunal

precluding the Respondent from filing with its Rejoinder a valuation of GRENLEC under

the Statutory Valuation Methodology and precluding evidence of “‘a quantification of its

Counterclaim in its Rejoinder or at a later date.” The Claimants sought a complete dismissal

of the nascent counterclaim which they argued had not yet been fleshed out in any detail.

After receiving observations from the Respondent on 21 February 2019, the Tribunal
issued Procedural Order No. 3 on 25 February 2019, permitting the Claimants to file a

Reply on or before 10 May 2019, limited to the Claimants’ response to the evidence in the

7 Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures dated 26 September 2019, Annex 1.

Rejoinder concerning (1) the Statutory Valuation, and (2) the particulars and quantification
of the counterclaim. The Tribunal also stated in this Order that its ruling did not pre-judge
the Claimants’ argument that the counterclaim is out of time and inadmissible. The
admissibility issue would be dealt with once the written pleadings were closed. The
Claimants’ additional costs associated with the 10 May 2019 Reply would be the subject

of the Tribunal’s consideration in due course.

On 29 March 2019, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder and Reply on Counterclaim,
including:

- Second Witness Statement of Minister Gregory Bowen dated 29 March 2019;

- Legal Authorities RLA-0077 through RLA-0180 as well as Mudge II Workpapers.

On 17 April 2019 the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal communicating the Parties’
agreement to extend the deadline to file the Response and certain other adjustments to the

procedural calendar.

On 1 May 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning the procedural

calendar reflecting the Parties’ agreed amendments.

On 24 May 2019, the Claimants filed a response to the Respondent’s Rejoinder of

HISTORY OF THE DISPUTE

Origins of GRENLEC

GRENLEC was incorporated as a private company on 27 September 1960.* The following
day, 28 September 1960, the GOG passed the Electricity Supply Ordinance of 1960 (“1960
ESO’) setting up the initial regulatory framework. GRENLEC was the monopoly supplier
and distributer of electricity in Grenada.? Though nominally private, GRENLEC was
controlled by the Colonial Development Corporation (“CDC”), a statutory corporation

established by the British Government.'°

Under the terms of the 1960 ESO, GRENLEC was granted an eighty-year exclusive license
for the generation, distribution, and transmission of electricity in Grenada including the

outlying islands of Carriacou and Petit Martinique.'!

The rate making procedure for
electricity consumption was set out in the First Schedule to the 1960 ESO. There were
criminal penalties for self-generation of electricity on the three islands unless authorized
by GRENLEC; these included fines of up to EC $240 or even “imprisonment with or

without hard labor for a period not exceeding six months.”!”

The Second Schedule to the ESO laid out a repurchase formula applicable in the event the
Government decided to revoke the arrangement. The formula contained two components:
first, a calculation of the net value of the company according to Part I of the Second

Schedule, and second, a calculation of the company’s “goodwill” as defined and calculated

by Part II of the Schedule. 3 The compensation formula, with modifications, has survived

for more than 50 years.

B. GRENLEC has Been an Ongoing Political Controversy Since Grenada’s
Independence in 1979

laws, including the 1960 ESO. It nationalized GRENLEC. The Revolutionary

suspended Grenada’s Constitution and

Government fell in 1983, and its successors moved to return certain industries to the private
sector with the financial assistance of the U.S. Agency for International Development,
which envisioned, among other things, “the development of a program to privatize major
state-owned enterprises.” > Privatization became a central plank in the economic and fiscal

programme of the NDC, which at the time formed the Government of Grenada. !°

51. It was hoped that privatization would attract much needed financial investment.'7
GRENLEC had promoted electrification across all the islands, but generation capacity did

not keep up with demand. Rural areas were particularly disadvantaged. '*

52. To further complicate matters, an oil leakage from the Queens Park sub-station
contaminated the soil and water in the surrounding area.'? Remediation of the
contamination was estimated to cost between USD $750,000 and USD $1,000,000,”° which
GRENLEC could ill afford. In addition, the Respondent concedes that before privatization

‘7 By the summer of 1993, GRENLEC had added a permanent generator that increased installed capacity by nearly
50% from pre-1991 levels, and further leased other generators to extend its trans! ion and distribution network
across the island but despite these initiatives, Grenada began to suffer from frequent black-outs and load shedding.
Further capital investment was needed in new generators and improvements in the distribution network. See Bowen,
para. 13; Witness Statement of John Auguste, dated 29 June 2018 (“Auguste”), para. 5.

GRENLEC lacked the necessary capital for making overdue investments in “new

generators and improvements in the distribution network.””!

A 1992 Memorandum commissioned by the World Bank underscored the importance of
privatisation, but cautioned that it should be done only alongside the development of a

regulatory framework suitable for public-private partnerships:

An adequate regulatory framework should be developed
accompanying the privatization of public utilities with monopolistic
features. This is particularly urgent in the case of the Grenada Electricity
Company, where private investors have indicated their interest in
purchasing the operations.” (emphasis added)

  

The Respondent NNP Government now contends that the former NDC Government failed
to create an “adequate regulatory framework”. The Public Utilities Commission (1994)

was designed (with input it says from WRB) to be “toothless”.

The World Bank noted that a problem with GRENLEC being part of the public sector was
that “short-term political objectives can override concerns for long-term economic
9923

viability. The current NNP Government suggests that the 1994 privatization was

structured to advance the “short-term political objectives” of the former NDC Government.

Privatization of GRENLEC

In the second half of 1993, the GOG engaged consultants PwC to advise on privatization

issues and to conduct a Request for Proposals (“RFP”) process for GRENLEC’s shares.”*+

As part of their engagement PwC produced an information memorandum outlining the
process for privatization and analyzing both GRENLEC and the regulatory framework,?>

building on earlier work done by the power and telecommunications consultancy firm,

Ewbank Preece.”° The RFP attracted a number of potential investors interested in
purchasing the GRENLEC shares. PwC analysed the submitted bids?’ and briefed the

relevant Government ministers.

58. As part of their due diligence, the GOG obtained various valuations of GRENLEC using
different valuation methodologies.** Using the DCF method, PwC arrived at a present
value within a very wide range of EC $8.70 million to EC $59.05 million.
The “comparable transaction” method produced a narrower range of EC $30.4 million to

EC $39.5 million.”

59. The RFP process attracted seven bids for the 50% stake in GRENLEC, including: (i)
Algonquin Power Corporation (Canada); (ii) the CDC (England); (iii) [VO International
(Finland); (iv) Power Systems, Inc. and NRECA International (USA); (v) Samsung/WSC
(USA); (vi) Synergics, Inc. (USA); and (vii) WRB Enterprises (USA).*°

60. WRB had been founded in 1969 by members of the Winter, Rozier, and Blanchard families
through the merger of two Caterpillar tractor and engine dealerships in Florida and South
Carolina.*! At the time of its bid for GRENLEC, WRB had an existing investment in the
Turks and Caicos Utility Company (“TCU”) which produced a tenth of that country’s

electricity production, with the rest supplied by a different utility on the other islands.*?

6l. Bids were assessed by PwC according to a variety of criteria including “[c]ommitment to
existing employees, [qualifications as a strategic partner, [a] well-articulated business &

management plan, [a] long-term investment plan, [c]lommitment to environmental clean-

value of all the bids to GRENLEC itself (EC $38.0 million) but WRB scored high on the
other criteria.*’7 The Respondent’s quantum expert, Mr. Robert Mudge, conceded that the

purchase price paid by WRB was in the upper range of PwC’s pre-bid valuations.**

p.3 which enumerated WRB’s proposal “protected all existing workers” of GRENLEC and in addition an employee
ownership plan. WRB ensured that there would be no layoffs and agreed to the rate-setting mechanism that the
Government favored (RPI-2), which entailed the “slowest rate of increasing prices”. WRB had experience in the
operation of another (albeit much smaller) Caribbean electric utility, Turks and Caicos Utilities, Ltd. and operating
diesel-based utilities and equipment. WRB offered significant additional cash equity investments for long-term capital
improvements and WRB’s senior management would remain engaged through the negotiation period and beyond.

38 Mr. Mudge testified as follows:

The Respondent notes that the WRB proposal included a substantial amount of cash up-
front®? and speculated that “[t]his was particularly attractive to the cash-strapped [NDC]
Government of the day, which was looking to increase government spending in advance of
an upcoming election.”*° However, the Respondent does not allege that there was any
illegality or impropriety in the selection of WRB.*! Nevertheless, the Respondent accuses

WRB of breaking many of its pre-contract promises including:

. “to utilize existing employees and improve their skills rather than rely on a system

of expatriate management”;

. to make EC $17 million worth of capital investments projected through the end of
1998, including investments in renewable energy, wind turbines and hydro

generation plants;

. WRB’s “expectation” that “substantially all of the earnings of GRENLEC will be

required to fund future capital investments to assure the long-term viability of

GRENLEC. This plan will leave no funds available for dividend payments.”*?

Q. GPP paid $19 million for its shares for its 50 percent share in GRENLEC.

A. Yes, I believe that’s correct.

Q. Now, the implied valuation of the 50 percent share is for the EC $38 million for a hundred percent share
of the Company?

A. That’s what this sentence seems to say, yes.

Q. And so, GPP paid in the high of the range that was presented by PwC; right?

A. If 22 to 38 represents — yes, it does represent 100 percent. Yes, that's correct. (emphasis added)

4! The Claimants reject any imputation that the process was unfair:

(i) they point out that the Government found that the other bids were “not as well constructed.” For example,
the highest bidder, PSGI, offered to broker shares in GRENLEC, rather than to act as a strategic partner, and
did not propose to invest any money of its own. Other bids were less attractive because they were “highly
levered,” “offered no protection of employees” or the “bidder had no transmission and distribution
experience, and no customer relations experience or utility operating experience.” (Reply Memorial dated 29
November 2018 (“Reply Memorial”), para. 21);

 

(ii) the Government was advised by “internationally-recognized experts in privatization and energy-sector
transactions” from PwC (who advised the Government from the inception of the RFP process through the
ultimate closing of the transaction) and a legal team led by then Attorney General of Grenada, the Honourable
Dr. Francis Alexis, Q.C., (a “local constitutional expert”) (Reply Memorial, paras. 26 and 27).

A Commission of Inquiry that the newly-elected NNP-led Government appointed in 1995
to investigate the circumstances of the GRENLEC sale, although critical of the

privatization in some respects, found no evidence of impropriety.**

The 1994 Share Purchase Agreement

The Government and the Claimants concluded the SPA on or about 14 September 19944
as part of a privatization package with the 1994 ESA and the PUCA. It is clear that WRB
would not have completed the purchase without the 1994 ESA to provide protection for its

investment.

On 15 September 1994, GPP purchased 50 percent of GRENLEC’s shares for EC $15

million, which assumed a 100% value of EC $30 million.4°

In addition to GPP’s 50% stake, WRB also controlled the 11.4% of GRENLEC owned by
Eastern Caribbean Holdings Limited (“ECH”), bringing the total shares of GRENLEC
effectively controlled by WRB to 61.3%.*° In summary, WRB indirectly owned 50% of
GRENLEC through its subsidiary GPP.*7 GRENLEC’s remaining shares were held by the
GOG (10%), the National Insurance Scheme (11.6%), ECH (11.4%), and various local
individuals and GRENLEC employees (17%).**

71. The 1994 ESA granted GRENLEC a monopoly over generation and distribution of

limits on the self-generation by Grenadians of electricity even for their own use.

may be) the necessary capital expenditures or increased operating costs resulting from the events necessitating
such Exogenous Cost recovery; and

>! Under the 1960 ESO, goodwill was based in part on the aggregate of the net trading profit for the five years
immediately prior to the revocation of GRENLEC’s license. Under the amended formulae in the 1994 ESA, revocation
of the license within five years of its issuance would entitle the Claimants to compensation for goodwill based on net
trading profits multiplied by 5-n, where n is equal to number of completed financial years (Ex. CE-0025, Second
Schedule, Part II).

(3) Calculation of Electricity Rates

The 1994 ESA divided the electricity rate into four basic components: fuel charges, non-
fuel charges, exogenous event adjustments, and special charges for fuel-conversion.**
Under the 1994 PUC Act, the PUC was empowered to review GRENLEC’s rates for
statutory compliance. The Public Utilities Commission Act, 1994, s. 17(3)(a) provides:

If an act provides the method of determining rates payable... whether on

the basis of an identified formula (such as the Retail Price Index — X (RPI-

X) formula or formulas) or otherwise, the Commission shall adhere to such

method ... and to this extent, the concept of a fair Rate of Return on
investment shall not apply. (emphasis added)**

The Respondent contends that the rate-setting formula of the 1994 ESA unduly favoured
GRENLEC as the formula permitted excessive passing on of cost increases to consumers
and, the Respondent says, in practice the Claimants maximized every opportunity to
increase rates. However, in cross-examination, the Minister for Public Utilities, Gregory
Bowen was obliged to admit that the Government not GRENLEC was the source of the
RPI-X rate-setting formula.*° Moreover, WRB had agreed to the “x” value most
favourable to the Government ’s desire for lower rates.°’ Further, the rates were reviewable
for statutory compliance by the PUC. The Respondent contends that the PUC was
dysfunctional through the years 1994 to 2016. If so, the Claimants respond, the reason for
this state of affairs was the NNP Government’s failure to make the necessary appointments
to the PUC itself. If the result was dysfunctional, the Claimants say, dysfunctionality was

the Government's choice.

(4) Composition of the GRENLEC Board of Directors

74. The GRENLEC Board is composed of twelve members.** Six of these members are
nominated by GPP.*® The Government and GRENLEC workers each nominate one
member to the Board. The remaining four members are elected each year, for a one-year
term at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders (the GPP group does not participate

in the election of these four “local” members).

75. The Chairman of the Board was a WRB appointee and was empowered to resolve any

nominee invariably exercised the casting vote to advance the Claimants’ interest rather
than the best interest of the economy of Grenada. This is another manifestation of the
“good corporate citizen” debate. The Claimants say it was quite proper for the
WRB-nominated Chairman to cast the deciding vote to advance WRB’s interest.
The Government on the other hand, contends that the Chair ought to have considered

GRENLEC’s broader public responsibilities as the island’s sole source of electrical power

with great impact on the local economy.

(5) WRB’s Consulting Services Agreement

76. As contemplated in the SPA, GRENLEC and WRB also executed a Management

Consulting Services Agreement (“Management Agreement”).

77. The Respondent contends the Management Agreement was never intended to be
permanent, but was kept in place for no good reason by the Claimants using their control
of the GRENLEC Board. According to the Respondent, the Claimants would make
decisions first, management would then implement those decisions, and only then would
the “local” GRENLEC directors be informed. When pressed on points of disagreement by

the locally-appointed directors, the Respondent says that WRB would claim that the

disputed measures were authorized by the Management Agreement.

78. The Respondent complains that the Parties envisaged that the scope and remuneration of
the Management Agreement should be subject to “annual review and approval” by both
WRB and GRENLEC Boards. However, in 1997, over the local directors’ objections, the
Management Agreement was “renewed and continue[d] [to be] in force until further
notice” at an increased annual fee of EC $600,000. The Management Agreement was not

reviewed or approved annually by the GRENLEC Board for almost two decades. No

assistance concerning the following matters: (i) power systems engineering, (ii) generation (electricity
production) maintenance, (iii) personnel training, (iv) data processing, and (v) administration, accounting and
financing. The Consulting Services will be coordinated with the activities of GRENLEC’s officers and
employees by GRENLEC’s General Manager. [s.1]

itemized invoices were provided by WRB to GRENLEC explaining what services were

rendered, or by whom.™

79. Nevertheless, the GRENLEC Board minutes thereafter do not record any objection by the
local directors. Mr. Palmer, a local director, testified that while he often disagreed with
Board decisions (where he felt WRB’s people voted in WRB’s interest without regard to

other stakeholders), he nevertheless frequently did not record his dissent.

E. A Change of Government Resulted in a Government Challenge to the
Constitutionality of the Privatization

80. The 1995 election returned to power the NNP which had been highly critical of the
GRENLEC privatization while in opposition, and maintained this position once

re-elected.® It:

(a) established, as mentioned, a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the sale of

GRENLEC;

(b) constituted a legislative committee to investigate its allegation that GRENLEC was

charging illegally high rates;°”

(c) declared that for procedural reasons, the 1994 ESA had never taken effect; and

Memorial, para. 71.

66 Report of the Commission of Inquiry 1996 (Ex. CE-0031). The Commi
67 A Joint Committee compared GRENLEC’s rates before and after privatization. The Committee reported to Minister
Bowen that “it was the unanimous agreement of the members of the committee that the actual rates charged by
GRENLEC over the period investigated, did not differ in any significant or material way from the rates obtained from
the application of the old formula.” Letter dated 15 July 1996 from W.R. Agostini to G. Bowen (Government) (Ex.
CE-0078).

8 Specifically, the Government argued that the previous administration’s failure to instruct the Governor General to
publish in the official Gazette the date on which the 1994 ESA came into force had the effect of extinguishing the
Government's obligation under the SPA to implement and abide by the 1994 ESA. (First Witness Statement of G.
Robert Blanchard, Jr., dated 1 March 2018 (“Blanchard I’), para. 34).

(d) sought renegotiation of various provisions of the SPA (including the purchase price

for the GRENLEC shares).

81. Minister Gregory Bowen, the NNP Minister responsible for overseeing GRENLEC,
warned WRB that renegotiation of the SPA was “not a matter of choice” and that it had
“always been the clear position of this administration” that the SPA was “neither legally
nor morally binding on the Government of Grenada” because the Prime Minister of
Grenada, who had signed the instrument of ratification “had no authority from Parliament”

to sign it. 7°

82. When the Government declared its intention not to honour its alleged contractual
obligations under the SPA and the 1994 ESA,"! WRB initiated an arbitration under ICSID
seeking an award compelling the GOG to repurchase the GRENLEC shares for USD $18.7
million, as calculated under the Second Schedule.”? This demand implied a substantial
capital gain over the EC $15 million purchase price. Settlement negotiations led to a
Supplemental SPA, dated 1 July 199873 which affirmed the validity of the 1994 ESA plus

other related relief.”

F. GRENLEC’s Lawsuit Against the Local Directors

84. In December 1999, four “local” directors, Rupert Agostini, Nelson Louison, Chester
Palmer, and Lawrence Samuel, held a press conference accusing WRB of serious
mismanagement of GRENLEC.”° They said the purchase of a prototype engine from
Caterpillar International Power Systems, Inc. was marred by self-dealing” in light of
WRB’s corporate connections’® and that relevant minutes of GRENLEC Board of
Directors meeting were falsified. This was denied by WRB which said the purchase was
through a European Investment Bank (“EIB”) approved tendering process designed by the
independent consultant, Seeling Bushea & Associates (“Bushea”).”? Further, at the press
conference the local directors claimed that WRB forced GRENLEC to pursue a dividend
policy to maximize near-term profits for its shareholders — and principally WRB itself, as
majority shareholder — at the expense of the company’s long-term viability.6” WRB had

neglected to make the necessary (and promised) capital investment in GRENLEC to ensure

75 Ex. RE-0014, para. 10.

7 Specifically, the local directors alleged: (a) GRENLEC’s affairs were “not being conducted in accordance with the
correct procedure and process”; (b) GRENLEC was “paying out dividends in excess of profit made”; (c) GRENLEC
had “falsified minutes and has tried to misrepresent what took place at meetings”; (d) “[N]egotiations with Cat Power
Systems Inc. for purchase of a new generator was [sic] unauthorised by the Board of Directors”; (e) “[T]he
appointment of Mr. G. Robert Blanchard Jr. as chairman of the Plaintiff is illegal and ultra vires [GRENLEC]’s
Articles of Association”; (f) GRENLEC “had acted improperly in paying out dividends in November, 1999”; (g)
“[T]he process whereby the Plaintiff decided to purchase a new engine from Cat Power Systems Inc. was not in
accordance with the resolution of the Board of Directors”; and (h) GRENLEC “carrie[d] on its affairs not in the interest
of its shareholders.” Press Conference Transcript, Agostini, Palmer, Luison, Samuel, held 9 December 1999 (Counter-

The Claimants state that the minutes allegedly subject to “falsification” were from the 14 June 1999 Board meeting at
which management was authorized to negotiate a contract with Caterpillar International. Those minutes were drafted
and brought to the Board at the 29 November 1999 meeting at which they were reviewed and confirmed before being
finalized. (Ex. CE-0097 at p. 2) The minutes do not disclose any concern raised about “falsification.” (Reply

the proper operation of the utility.*! WRB had made no further capital investment in
GRENLEC after the original share purchase, although further investment was made from

time to time by GRENLEC itself from its own funds.

WRB denied the allegations made by the four directors which it said “threatened

GRENLEC’s reputation, divided the Board, and disrupted employees and management.”*?

The Claimants caused the GRENLEC Board to direct GRENLEC to sue the four directors*?
for breach of fiduciary duties. The defendants counterclaimed that the business “is being
carried on in a manner that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to or that unfairly disregards
the interest of all the shareholders.”** There have been settlement discussions but no
settlement. The four directors refused to settle unless GRENLEC paid their legal fees.
They contend that they spoke out in their capacity as GRENLEC directors and as such were
entitled to reimbursement for legal expenses. WRB says payment of legal fees would
amount to an admission of wrongdoing by the Claimants. The dispute remains before the
courts.** GRENLEC has not pursued its claims and the local directors have not moved to

have the case dismissed for want of prosecution.

WRB Offered to Sell its Shares to the Government in 2013 at EC $8.27 a Share

In late 2012, WRB proposed to sell its stake in GRENLEC to a third party buyer (which
had already purchased WRB’s shares in Domlec in the Dominican Republic) but under the
SPA, the Government had a right of first refusal to purchase GPP’s shares.*° WRB

represented that it was in a position to sell both GPP’s 50% stake and the 11.4% stake

8! Reply Memorial, para. 95. WRB stated that GRENLEC had never paid dividends in excess of profits, and financial
reports detailing GRENLEC’s accounts were consistently distributed to directors in advance of Board meetings in
order to facilitate accountability.

owned by ECH. Accordingly, the negotiations at the time were for the sale of 61.4% of

the Company.*’

Eventually, the Government made WRB an offer of EC $5.49 per share.** By letter dated
23 October 2013, WRB rejected this offer, but offered “to enter into exclusive negotiations
with the GOG if the government [was] prepared to increase its offer to EC $8.27 per

share.”®?

The Government did not raise its offer. The negotiations died. WRB did not pursue to
conclusion a sale of the GRENLEC shares to any other interested party at that time.
However, the Respondent contends that WRB’s offer to sell at EC $8.27 a share provides
an accurate benchmark of their value in 2013 which affords a good indication of the value
of the shares in 2016 and supports the Respondent’s position that Second Schedule

compensation is grossly in excess of the true value of the shares.

GRENLEC Pays a Special Dividend

As the prospect of a government repurchase loomed, GRENLEC issued a special dividend
to its shareholders” of EC $57 million, or EC $3.00 per share.?! Regular dividends had

routinely stood at less than EC $1.00 per share.

To pay this dividend, GRENLEC took out a mortgage debenture loan on 29 February 2016
from CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank for EC $48 million.°? The Respondent says
that recourse to a loan shows the dividend was wrongly declared because, as of the end of
2015, GRENLEC had only slightly over EC $18 million in after tax profit, and only EC
$16.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. As part of the loan, GRENLEC assigned to the

bank a charge on all of its assets, including the property, plant and equipment as collateral

8 Ex. RE-0041, at pp. 79-80.
88 Bowen, para. 52; Ex. RE-0051.

89 Ex. RE-00S1. The letter further explained that if the Government were to increase its offer to EC $8.27, WRB
“would expect those negotiations to be concluded within 21 days and include a closing date prior to December 20
[2013] as well as other provisions previously discussed with the [G]overnment.”

for the mortgage loan. The Respondent complains that this charge added another constraint

on GRENLEC’s financial ability to raise capital to meet new investment requirements.”

92. The Claimants respond that the Respondent misunderstands or misrepresents GRENLEC’s
financial position. What is important is not a corporation’s cash but the accumulation of
its retained earnings. Dividends are paid from accumulated profits (retained earnings).
Grenada retained a positive balance of EC $19 million in retained earnings even after
payment of the Special Dividend. The fact GRENLEC did not have cash to pay the
dividend is irrelevant. The overall transaction increased GRENLEC’s debt but the result
was to adjust GRENLEC’s debt to equity ratio to “better align” with GRENLEC’s

historical average.**

93. The Claimants argue that the Special Dividend constituted a sort of “catch-up” after several
years of self-restraint,”° and that it was discussed and approved by the Board’® (which of
course WRB controlled) and disclosed to the Eastern Caribbean Securities Exchange.”

The Claimants point out that the shareholders’ equity at the end of 2016 (after payment of

°3 Ex. RE-0063, at pp. 9-12.

% Blanchard II, para. 80.

°’ The Claimants argue that the Special Dividend followed many years of very conservative dividends
(Reply Memorial, para. 100). Sometimes dividends were not paid at all, for example following Hurricane Ivan or
during the prolonged periods when the Government failed to pay its electricity bills which weakened GRENLEC’s
cash flow. At other times, dividends were paid but at a rate far below profits. For example, during the period 2008
through 2015, only 56% of GRENLEC’s profits were paid out in dividends. The result of low, or non-existent,
dividend payments was a build-up of equity that jumped to over EC $100 million by 2015. This substantial
accumulation of shareholders’ equity was accompanied by GRENLEC paying off debts: GRENLEC’s debt dropped
dramatically from EC $88.6 million in 2007 to EC $29.7 million in 2015 (GRENLEC Annual Report, dated 31
December 2007 (Ex. CE-0108) at 31; GRENLEC Annual Report 2015 (Ex. CE-0152) at 28). As GRENLEC
accumulated equity and paid off debts, GRENLEC’s shareholders carried a disproportionately large share of
GRENLEC’s financing burden, while GRENLEC’s lenders carried too small a share. The Special Dividend
transaction corrected this trend, the Claimants say, by paying out some of the accumulated profits (Reply Memorial,
para. 101).

the Special Dividend) was over EC $50 million,®® including EC $19 million in retained

earnings.”°

In negotiating the CIBC loan, GRENLEC took advantage of low interest rates and used the
proceeds in part to retire GRENLEC’s more-expensive (higher-interest) debt as well as to

fund (in greater part) the Special Dividend.

The Claimants argue that the Special Dividend in fact reduced the quantum of the
Claimants’ claim in this arbitration as it reduced the assets to be valued under the Second

Schedule of the 1994 ESA, and thus the claimed repurchase price. !°°

In the Tribunal’s view, the debate over the Special Dividend simply reflects the contrasting
views of the Parties regarding GRENLEC and the role of the Claimants’ investment in
GRENLEC. The GOG sees GRENLEC as a key player in the economic development of
the islands and believes WRB should share that vision by, for example, making significant
investment in renewable energy. Instead of maximizing dividends, WRB should have
caused GRENLEC to plough money back into the business. By contrast, WRB sees
GRENLEC as a profitable investment which is rightly managed to maximize shareholder
value. The Respondent has not pointed to any relevant provision under Grenada company
law, the ESA 1994 or the SPA, which was violated by the Special Dividend or by the
decision to largely fund it through the CIBC loan. The Claimants say, and the Tribunal
accepts as correct, that WRB was under no legal obligation to share the Respondent NNP

Government’s view of the best interest of Grenada.

THE 2016 RESTRUCTURING THAT ALLEGEDLY TRIGGERED THE
GOVERNMENT’S REPURCHASE OBLIGATION

On 25 May 2016, the Senate of Grenada passed the Electricity Supply Act and Public
Utilities Regulatory Commission Act (respectively, the “2016 ESA” and the “2016
PURCA”, collectively, “the 2016 Acts”) which came into force on 1 August 2016. The
legislation was part of a restructuring of the electricity sector promised by the NNP
Government consistently with its long-standing view that privatization of GRENLEC had
been a mistake and its implementation bungled. The 2016 Acts shortened and narrowed
GRENLEC’s exclusive license on the generation of electricity and cut short any future

101

license, '®! cancelled its monopoly on permitting or refusing self-generators,!°” abolished

the statutory rate-setting mechanism,!°?

and replaced it with a more discretionary
procedure before the PURC as well as eliminating GRENLEC’s import duty and tax
concessions.!°* GRENLEC no longer had authorization to harness potential wind and
water power without making payment to the Government.'! The guarantee of
compensation for revocation of the license contained in Sections 28, 29, and the Second

Schedule to the 1994 ESA was removed. !°°

The Claimants allege and the Respondent denies, that the 2016 laws (the “Restructuring

Package”) constituted three separate Repurchase Events:

(a) the amendments to the rate-setting mechanism under the 1994 ESA, modified
“GRENLEC’s rate adjustment, recovery or collection rights, privileges or
procedures or service requirements,” so as to engage Section 7.9(a)(iii).!°’ The
Respondent denies that this change constitutes a “repurchase event” because the

PURC has yet to make regulations and there has therefore been no “adverse effect

on the business or shares in GRENLEC” as required by Section 7.9(a)(iii).
Moreover, the Respondent suggests that a drop in rates for electricity will

eventually increase demand and ultimately benefit GRENLEC;

(b) the elimination of GRENLEC’s exemption from customs and other duties on
imported materials, “increased [GRENLEC’ s] operating costs” within the terms of
Section 7.9(a)(vii).'"°° The Respondent counters there is no evidence that

GRENLEC has thereby actually experienced any increase in costs; and

(c) the modification of the term of GRENLEC’s licence and abrogation of its
exclusivity come within the terms of Section 7.9(a)(iv).! The Respondent does
not dispute that the 2016 Acts modified GRENLEC’s monopoly and narrowed its
scope. As to this ground, the Respondent acknowledges in the Counter-Memorial

that:

There is no dispute that the 2016 ESA has truncated the eighty-year
GRENLEC licence and heralded the end of the Company’s monopoly of
all generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Grenada.!!°

In the event of a Repurchase Event, the GOG “shall...purchase and acquire all GRENLEC
shares then owned by [GPP],” and the “purchase price payable ... shall be calculated on
the basis specified in the Second Schedule to the [1994] ESA.”!!! Eventually the Claimants

pursued only the third ground, namely abrogation of the monopoly. Even on this ground,

however, the Respondent takes the position that the Claimants’ “extreme or wilful

malfeasance” in the conduct of GRENLEC’s business disentitles the Claimants from

108 Memorial, para. 80. Section 7.9(a)(vii) of the SPA is engaged in the event of “any change in Grenadian Law
enacted or taking effect on or after the Closing Date which requires new capital expenditures or increased operating
costs by GRENLEC, unless the resulting recovery of Exogenous Costs that GRENLEC would be entitled to receive
in connection with such change pursuant to the ESA is sufficient to enable GRENLEC to finance the necessary new
capital expenditures or increased operating cos See Ex. RE- 0089, s. 7.9(a)(vii).

Consequently, on 22 March 2017, ten months after the passage of the 2016 Acts, the
Claimants wrote to the Government stating that the 2016 Acts “‘g[ave] direct rise” to a
number of Repurchase Events!!?

Schedule, which the Claimants calculated at USD $65,428,963 payable within 30 days.!!3

and demanded the purchase price according to the Second

On 2 May 2017, the Government responded that there was a good-faith dispute as to
whether the passage of the 2016 Acts gave rise to any obligation to repurchase the

GRENLEC shares from WRB!" and requested negotiations to “resolve the matter”.

Three days later, on 5 May 2017, the Claimants filed a Request for Arbitration with

ICSID, which gave rise to the present proceedings.

At a press conference on 8 May 2017, Prime Minister Mitchell restated his desire to

negotiate a settlement:

Dr. Mitchell told reporters... WRB has been written to by the Minister of
Public Utilities (Gregory Bowen) through the Attorney General office
about their request to government to buy the shares. As you know in any
disputes and any request for cost of a particular buy out in any
situation usually it’s a negotiating process and clearly what we did was
write WRB saying you just stated what the buyout should be, it’s just the
basis (to start the process[)].” (emphasis added)

112 Ex, RE-0080, at pp. 2-3.

113 Tbid., at p. 5. On 1 March 2018, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits. In their submission, the
Claimants revised their repurchase demand, increasing it from USD $65,428,923 to USD $67,358,975, plus interest
(Memorial, para. 124).

'l4 The letter from the Attorney General Hon. Anthony C.K. Hood states:

For the avoidance of doubt, the Government has not accepted or agreed to the GPP Demand, and expressly
reserves all rights and remedies, whether or not asserted in the March 28 letter or any other correspondence.
As you are aware, under Section 7.9© of the SPA, the Government is under no obligation to make any
payment if there is a good-faith dispute between the Parties concerning whether a Repurchase Event
has occurred.

The Government considers, however, that it is in all Parties’ interests to determine if a reasonable, amicable
resolution of the matter may be reached. The Government's review of the GPP Demand, including analysis
of the [Claimants] KPMG Report, is ongoing and may entail requests for additional information. In the
interim, to ensure that the process moves forward, we propose that the Parties schedule a meeting during the
week of June 5, 2017 to discuss these issues, in which the participants will be representatives of the Parties
who are authorized to resolve the matter. (emphasis added) (Ex. CE-0017).

So, now we are being asked to pay goodwill and I can’t blame [WRB] so
we have to negotiate. We may have to pay some goodwill indeed
unfortunately. ..!!°

103. The Claimants note that at the press conference, the Prime Minister did not deny that the
2016 Acts put the GOG under an obligation to repurchase the shares and pay compensation
nor did the Prime Minister speak of “extreme or wilful malfeasance”. The Prime Minister’s
only issue was to negotiate how much compensation would have to be paid to purchase the

GRENLEC shares.

V. ISSUES IN DISPUTE

104. |The Claimants seek an award:

(a) declaring that a “Repurchase Event” has occurred and that the Government is
therefore obligated to purchase and acquire all GRENLEC shares owned by GPP
at the price calculated on the basis specified in the Second Schedule to the 1994
ESA, namely a value of EC $361.882 million [USD $134 million] for 100% of
GRENLEC, and EC $180.941 million [USD $67 million] for the Claimants’ 50%
interest in GRENLEC;

(b) declaring that the Government has breached its obligations to the Claimants under
the SPA by failing to purchase and acquire, by no later than 3 May 2017, all
GRENLEC shares owned by GPP;

(c) ordering that the Government complete, within 30 days of the Tribunal’s award, its
purchase and acquisition of all GRENLEC shares owned by GPP, and by no later
than such time, to pay the Claimants, in immediately available funds, the sum of

not less than EC $180.941 million [USD $67 million];

(d) awarding the Claimants pre-and post-award interest on the repurchase price of EC

$180.941 million (and on all other amounts awarded), at a rate of 6% compounded

15 NNP regime backing down on hostile GRENLEC position, THE NEW TODAY, dated 8 May 2017 (Ex. CE-0049).

-42-
semi-annually, from 3 May 2017 up until the date of payment;

(e) declaring that all sums to be paid by the Government pursuant to the Tribunal’s
award must be paid net of, and exempt from, all Grenadian taxes, levies, and other
duties and may be repatriated by the Claimants free and exempt from all Grenadian

taxes, levies, and other duties;
(f) dismissing the Government’s counterclaim;

(g) awarding the Claimants the costs, including attorneys’ fees, associated with

enforcing its rights prior to these proceedings; and

(h) awarding the Claimants the costs, including attorneys’ fees, associated with these

proceedings, including all professional fees and disbursements. !'°

105. With respect to liability, the Respondent raises as grounds for defence and rejection of the

claim in whole or in part:

(a) the Claimants have failed to establish that a rate-adjustment repurchase event has

occurred;!"” or that a cost-increase repurchase event has occurred 18 and that wilful

'l6 Reply, para. 293. In the Reply, the Claimants sought the sum of not less than EC $182,150,000, which was
revised to EC $180.941 million during the course of the hearing.

117 The Respondent argues that under SPA 7.9(a)(iii), no Repurchase Event is established unless three cumulative
requirements are met: (i) the Government made a change to “GRENLEC’s rate adjustment, recovery or collection
rights, privileges or procedures or service requirements”; (ii) that this change was effected “without the consent of
GRENLEC, not to be unreasonably withheld”; and (iii) the change had “an adverse effect on the Business or the shares
of GRENLEC.” (Ex. RE-0089) The Respondent denies any “adverse effect” under the 2016 PURCA. Any public
utility may seek a rate increase from PURC “on the ground that the claimed rate modification is fair and reasonable
so that the modified rate would constitute a fair return upon the fair value of its property.” The Respondent argues
that even if the Government's reforms result in lower rates, that would be justified under the 1994 ESA. The drop in
price could very well boost investment and overall demand in the market, thus leading to an increase in overall
revenues for energy supplier, including GRENLEC. (See Counter-Memorial, para. 162). However, this theory is not
supported by expert evidence. In particular, the PURC may consider (i) the efficient capital employed by the relevant
public utility, valued at the most efficient cost; (ii) the efficient operating expenses of the public utility; (iii) the annual
depreciation calculated upon the efficient capital cost ofthe public utility; (iv) taxes and other duties as may be payable
by the public utility; (v) the returns on the depreciated efficient original cost rate base of the public utility; (vi) the
requirement that the public utility provide an up-to-date and cost effective service to the public and that it keeps up-
to-date with technological and other advances in its particular industry; and (vii) the quality of the service provided
by the public utility”). (Ex. CE-0009)

''8 The Respondent argues that there is no “cost increase” repurchase event despite the elimination of “GRENLEC’s
exemption from customs and other duties on imported materials.” Mr. Blanchard states in witness statement that,
“GRENLEC incurred EC $1,211,440 in additional costs in the period January 1, 2014 through August 1, 2016,” as a

 

-43-

malfeasance precludes any finding of a Repurchase Event on the basis of the

abrogation of the monopoly;

(b) even if there had been a Repurchase Event, the Respondent is under no liability to

pay Second Schedule compensation because:
(i) Second Schedule compensation constitutes an unenforceable penalty;

(A) _ the Claimants’ demand is not just the specific performance of a put
option but a remedy by way of liquidated damages for the failure of

the GOG to repurchase the GRENLEC shares;

(B) _ the repurchase demand of revised to USD $67 million is grossly
disproportionate to any legitimate expectation the Claimants could

have in obtaining compensation for their shares;

(ii) moreover, imposition of Second Schedule compensation is an
unconstitutional attempt to fetter the lawful exercise of governmental
authority and contractual provisions that contravene the constitution are

void and can have no legal effect;

(c) on the issue of Quantum, the Respondent contends that if a repurchase event is
established, the Claimants should nevertheless receive no more than the fair market

value of their shares;

(i) the Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) method is the appropriate method to

estimate the fair market value of the Claimants’ shares;

(ii) the fair market value of the Claimants’ shares under the 2016 ESA is no

more than EC $63.6 million (USD $23.6 million);

result of the partial termination of its tax exemption effected by the Electricity Supply Amendment Act 2013. (See
Memorial, para. 96; Blanchard I, para. 48.)

VI.

106.

-44-

(iii) in the alternative, the fair market value of the Claimants’ shares under the

1994 ESA is no more than EC $82.3 million (USD $30.5 million);

(iv) _ in the further alternative, should the Tribunal apply the Second Schedule, it
should disregard the Claimants’ inflated valuation and apply the updated
PwC assessment of EC $276.239 million (USD $51.2 million);

(d) and by way of Counterclaim, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have
unfairly prejudiced GRENLEC’s minority shareholders including the Government
through “disadvantageous transactions and subsequent litigious behavior”, the
Claimants’ payment of “improper dividends” and promotion of “discrimination”

between shareholders.'!? The amount of claimed damages is not quantified.

JURISDICTION

The Respondent has not raised any objection against the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. In
accordance with Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal is the judge of its
own competence. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention foresees that “[t]he jurisdiction
of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between
a Contracting State [...] and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to
the dispute consent in writing to submit national of another Contracting State, which the
parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. In addition, Article 25(2)(b)
of the ICSID Convention establishes that a “National of another Contracting State” means
“any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State
party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to
conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the
Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control,
the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the

purposes of this Convention.”

First the Tribunal is satisfied that the Parties consented in writing to submit the dispute to
the Centre. In particular, the Parties agreed in Section 11.2(a) of the SPA to submit any

dispute “arising out of or in connection with” the SPA to ICSID. !7°

Second, the Tribunal is further satisfied that the Claimants are nationals of another
Contracting State for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The United
States of America has been an ICSID Contracting State since 14 October 1966, and

Grenada has been an ICSID Contracting State since 23 June 1991.!7!

WRB is a company incorporated in Florida, United States. GPP is a company incorporated
in Grenada, which qualifies as a “national of another Contracting State” in light of the
Parties’ agreement in s. 11.2(a) of the SPA which provides that “[f]or purposes of
consenting to the jurisdiction of the Convention, the Parties agree that each of the Buyer

Parties [which includes GPP] is a foreign controlled entity.”

Based on the evidence before it, the Tribunal is also satisfied that there is a legal dispute

arising out of an investment for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that it has jurisdiction over the present dispute between

the Claimants and the Respondent.

APPLICABLE LAW

Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that “[t]he Tribunal shall decide a dispute
in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties.” Section 11.1 of the
SPA provides that it is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of
Grenada, a defined term that includes “the Constitution of Grenada” and “the common law
of Grenada”. However, this general instruction is qualified in s. 11.1 itself by “the
understanding” that the provisions of s. 7.9 [pertaining to the repurchase mechanism] and
other identified sections of the SPA are to apply “notwithstanding inconsistent provisions

of Grenadian law”. As will be seen, the Parties disagree on whether there is any

20 Ex, CE-0007, s. 11.2(a).

inconsistency between s. 7.9 and Grenadian law, and if so, whether, as a matter of law, the

“carve out” of s. 7.9 from the application of Grenadian law is effective.

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS OF THE LIABILITY ISSUES

The Respondent’s Allegation that the Terms of the 1994 Privatization Were
Oppressive to Grenada

At the outset, the Tribunal wishes to address the Respondent’s general challenge to the
1994 package of laws and agreements made by the prior (and rival) NDC government as
extravagantly improvident. The Claimants, says the NNP Government, have performed
badly. They have reaped unconscionable benefits while hindering progress and in
particular obstructed the development of “utility scale” renewable energy. It would be
oppressive and unfair to reward the Claimants for their mismanagement with a grossly

excessive award of compensation calculated under the Second Schedule.

The Respondent does not seek to set aside the SPA or Supplementary SPA as
unconscionable or tainted with bad faith. There is no allegation of corruption.

The Tribunal will now address the following particulars.
() The GOG Negotiating Team Lacked Expertise

According to the Respondent, the Government team had no experience of GRENLEC’s
operations or the energy sector itself.'2* WRB and its legal team were able to extract a raft
of concessions in exchange for a bloated offer of up-front cash.'?? The inordinate length
of the licence and GRENLEC’s exclusive control of electricity generation were relics of
the colonial regime left behind by the British.!** WRB’s expanded list of Repurchase
Events included penalty provisions taken from colonial-era legislation, which,!?> when
combined with gutting any meaningful PUC “oversight” capacity, left the Government

with no practical means of regulating the Claimants’ conduct.

However, the Claimants point out that the GOG team was led by senior Ministers and
advised at every stage by Price Waterhouse and other consultants. The GRENLEC shares
went to tender in an open multi-stage bidding progress. The suggested use of the Second

Schedule methodology came originally from the Government not the Claimants.
The Commission of Inquiry set up by the NNP Government itself in 1997 reported that:

Price Waterhouse produced a Privatization Project in June 1993, a
valuation of GRENLEC in June 1993, a review of its valuation in May
1994, an analysis of the best and final offers in December 1993, a summary
of the finalists’ proposals in December 1993, and a comparison of the best
and final offers in December 1993.17°

The Commission of Inquiry was critical of some of the ultimate terms of the privatization
(“thought-provoking”), but concluded that the Government made the deal with its eyes

wide open.!?7

In the Tribunal’s view, there is no credible evidence of impropriety or victimization in
the negotiation of the SPA. The terms of the SPA thus negotiated do not look as attractive
to the present NNP Government as they did to the 1994 NDC Government, but that is no

basis for concluding that the Government was the victim of a lopsided or unfair negotiation.
(2) GRENLEC’s Monopoly Was an Anomalous “Colonial-Era” Monopoly

The NDC Government’s initial Request for Proposals presented GRENLEC as a “natural
monopoly.” !?8 However, the NNP Government now says, the scope, exclusivity and 80-
year term of the monopoly granted to GRENLEC under the 1994 ESA inappropriately
carried forward the 1960 model and fettered the Government’s ability to intervene in the
energy sector in the public interest, and adversely affected development of Grenada’s

abundant renewable energy resources.

26 Commission of Inquiry Report, Ex. CE-0031 at p. 8.

127 Thid., at concluding summary: “No opinion is given as to whether the best terms were obtained for Government’s
shares in GRENLEC, but the mention by us of certain provisions of the Share Purchase Agreement which we consider
to be unfair to Government and to be not in the best interests of Grenada, should be thought-provoking.” (pp. 52-53).

In the Tribunal’s view, there is no doubt the 1994 privatization reduced the GOG’s public
policy options. The NDC Government made a trade-off between continuing state control
and private investment. The evidence is that monopolies are prevalent in small island

energy markets in the Caribbean.!??

The International Monetary Fund reviewed the
Caribbean energy markets in 2016 and concluded that “[f]or the most part, electric utilities
are vertically integrated monopolies that hold exclusive licenses for generation,

transmission, distribution and sale of electricity.”!°°

The grant of a monopoly was
important to profitability and affected the price that investors (including WRB) were
prepared to offer for shares in GRENLEC.'*! The Tribunal does not accept this aspect of

the Respondent’s attack on the 1994 privatization.

(3) The GOG Regulator, the Public Utilities Commission Established Under the
1994 Regime was “Inoperative” Because the “Claimants had Designed [it] to
be Toothless, in the Contract and Legislation they Drafted in 1994”!

The Respondent complains that the 1994 restructured PUC was “toothless” because the

PUC Act did not permit effective government oversight of GRENLEC or grant adequate

powers to curb its mismanagement.

However, the evidence is that design of the PUC was established by the Government itself
before the bidding began: see GRENLEC Information Memorandum, dated 1993, which
noted that “the proposed Public Utilities Commission Act...ias been presented to the

Parliament for approval.”!°

It is true that the role of the PUC in rate setting adjustments was largely limited to whether
the proposals complied with the 1994 ESA formula but the limited role (which caused the
resignation of some PUC Commissioners) gave potential investors security and a margin

of protection once their investment had been made. In this particular trade-off between

regulation and maximizing investment the NDC government chose investment, and this

choice factored into the price the bidders were prepared to pay for GRENLEC shares.

The allegation that it was the Claimants which masterminded a “toothless” 1994 PUC Act
was not supported by any evidence of impropriety in the 1994 negotiations and is not
consistent with the bid records. The Respondent’s chief fact witness, Minister Gregory
Bowen, had no personal involvement in the 1994 negotiations and disclaimed personal

knowledge of how they were conducted.

When some members of the PUC resigned after the 1994 changes to the PUC, Minister
Bowen did not replace them. The Tribunal does not accept the Respondent’s submission
that no qualified individuals in Grenada could be found to accept an appointment to the
PUC which had a role in respect of all utilities in Grenada including but not limited to the
electricity sector. It was the Government’s failure to staff the PUC (whether “toothless”
or not) rather than any action by the Claimants that led it to be “inoperative”. As a result,
for example, the PUC complaint procedure was not only unavailable to electricity rate

payers but also to the customers of the other utilities in Grenada as a whole.

It is of interest that new regulations are expected to be passed by the Public Utilities
Regulatory Commission (the “PURC”) under the 2016 PURC Act but there is no evidence

that this has yet been done.

(4) The Electricity Rate-Setting Framework [RPI-X] Meant That “Virtually Any
Increase in Costs was Directly Passed on to the Grenadian Consumer”

The Respondent does not claim that any of the GRENLEC rate increases since 1994

contravened the statutory formula.

The evidence is that the rate-setting methodology in the 1994 ESA was presented by the
Government in its offering memorandum during the RFP process. The Government
received advice from PwC that the rate structure selected would have a “significant effect”

on the price obtainable for GRENLEC shares.'** It then instructed bidders to assume, for

‘4 Privatization Plan & Valuation for GRENLEC, Section III on Valuation of GRENLEC, dated June 1993 (Ex. CE-
0066), at pp. 8-10; Memorandum, GRENLEC Privatization Issues, dated 16 August 1994 (Ex. RE-0009), at p.

-50-

purposes of their bids, that non-fuel charges would “be set using RPI-X”'* [i.e. Retail
Price Index minus a negotiated value of “x”’] and that any increase in fuel oil prices would
be incorporated in electricity rates based on actual prices.”'*° The evidence is that the
“RPI-X” formula is common in regulated industries. The Government advised bidders that
the specified rate structure would “form the basis to compare bids and begin
negotiations.” >” Ultimately, in terms of non-fuel charges, the Claimants agreed to the
formula of RPI-2 (i.e. “x” equals 2) which required GRENLEC to achieve cost efficiencies
substantially in excess of increases in the retail price index [RPI] in order to justify a real

rate increase.

130. The Tribunal finds that the Government has not established that the RPI-X formula is

either unusual or worked unfairly to Grenada’s disadvantage.
(5) GRENLEC’s Electricity Rates in Grenada are Excessive '**

131. The Respondent alleges that GRENLEC’s electricity rates are higher than can be

justified. !°°

132. In response to this allegation, the Claimants called an expert, Dr. Boaz Moselle, who

testified that rates in Grenada were consistent with Caribbean markets generally!”

1 (*PW[C] estimated GRENLEC’s cash flow using various assumptions for the rate structure (RPI, RPI-2)...The
higher the value the less favourable were the conditions for the consumer, i.e. the higher would be the price of
electricity.”).

135 Electricity rates consisted of (i) a “non-fuel” charge, adjusted by the rate of inflation (the Reference Price Index or
“RPI”) less a specified amount (referred to as “X” or 2%), and (ii) a “fuel” charge reduced by a stipulated portion of
fuel efficiency savings. Accordingly, under the statutory formula, the maximum increase in the non-fuel charge in a
given year was the rate of inflation less 2%.

‘3° The Inter-American Development Bank drafted an Energy Dossier outlining the challenges and opportunities in
2015 and concluded that Grenada “pos: substantial renewable energy potential. Its geothermal prospects are
excellent, and its location in the tropics ensures widespread availability of wind and solar resources as well as
municipal waste-to-energy.” See Ex. CE-0042 at p. 7.

 
 
 

440 Dr, Moselle’s analysis is as follows:

-51-

especially those which operated without Government subsidies. '*!

The Respondent’s
expert, Robert Mudge, compared Grenada rates with U.S. rates, an exercise which the

Tribunal considers unhelpful.

133. In any event, the Respondent does not dispute that the rates were calculated according to
the SPA formula to which the prior Government had agreed.
(6) The Failure of GRENLEC, Under WRB’s Direction, to Develop Grenada’s
Ample Resources of Renewable Energy
134. The Respondent states that the 2016 restructuring laws were in the national interest

because GRENLEC was squandering Grenada’s renewable energy potential. It points out,
correctly, that Grenada is blessed with much sun for solar energy, much wind for industrial
2

turbines and much potential for the generation of geo-thermal energy.'#? In relation to

these great opportunities, GRENLEC’s investment for renewable energy, according to the

 

Dr. Moselle testified that the comparison favours Grenada more strongly for commercial and industrial consumers.

(Moselle, p. 41)

141 Dr, Moselle responded to Mr. Mudge in part as follows:
Now, turning to Slide 21, Mr. Mudge makes a very good point about this comparison. He says you have these
prices from 19 other markets, you, Moselle, but your Grenada price is from 2015, and not all of the comparator
prices are from 2015, so I agree with him that it’s better to use only data from 2015. Now, unfortunately, it’s
not available for all 19, or I wasn’t able to find 2015 prices for all 19 islands, but what we can do very simply
is take those graphs and delete the dots where the prices are not from 2015, and so make a comparison which
is only for prices that are exactly from 2015. And doing that, as I'll show you in a minute, leads you to the
same qualitative conclusion, so Grenada’s rates are still in line with those of the utilities in comparable
markets.

Respondent, is a pittance. Given the rate-setting structure, GRENLEC was given no
incentive to switch to renewables from expensive imported diesel fuel, the cost of which

constitutes a significant drain on Grenada’s foreign reserves.

135. The Inter-American Development Bank observed that development of energy resources in

Grenada was “hampered” by the regime created by the 1994 ESA:

The existing legislative and regulatory framework has enabled a
monopolistic, fossil fuel-biased development of the electricity sector,
severely hampering the development of renewable energy
technologies. Furthermore, the ability of external forces, such as the
government, to implement changes to encourage the use of renewable
energy is limited under the current framework. '**

136. For whatever reasons (and the Parties point the finger of blame at each other), the result
has been a disappointing level of renewable energy development, as the Claimants’
witness, Robert Blenker acknowledged: 144

Q. Excuse me, Mr. Blenker. No utility-scale renewables project in
Grenada by the end of 2017; right?

A. That is correct.

Q. No geothermal energy project?

A. No.

Q. No utility-scale solar?

A. No.

Q. No wind power connected to the grid.
A. Nothing significant, no.

Q. Okay. Now, in the current plan that is the 2014 to 2020 renewable
energy Strategic Plan, you set a new goal for GRENLEC of increasing
renewable energy penetration to 20 percent of the nation’s electricity
usage by 2020; right?

A. Yes.
Q. Okay. It’s 2019 now. GRENLEC isn’t going to hit that target, is it?
A. No.

137. The Respondent lists what it regards as lost opportunities:

(a) despite potential for solar development on the island, in 2015 only 0.6% of
generation capacity came from solar,'* and two-thirds of this solar power came
from interconnected private owners. © The Claimants say they were unable to

acquire the necessary land for utility scale facilities;'*”

(b) despite the potential for wind generation, a very promising site on the island of

Carriacou remains undeveloped; 148

(c) despite the potential for geothermal generation, '*? GRENLEC and the Government
could not advance its development beyond preliminary Heads of Agreement. The

Claimants blame the Government, as testified by Mr. Blenker:

Q. To be clear, Mr. Blenker, it’s your testimony that the reason that the
geothermal resource has not been developed is because the Government
has not engaged with GRENLEC?

A. Yes, 5°

138. The Respondent says WRB insisted on unreasonable concessions. For whatever reason,

the potential remains untapped.

147 Mr. Blenker explained:
... following our inability to obtain sufficient land to do a utilities-scale project, whether it be wind or solar,
we, as a short-term measure, we opted to just move ahead and do whatever we could do, which was to put
solar on property we already owned, and this included the buildings at Queen’s Park, this included some
ground-mounted solar at plains on a piece of property that GRENLEC owned, as well as on Petite Martinique,
and I think that’s what that reflects. So, despite our inability to make significant headways in large enough
parcels of land, you also notice that even with certain regulatory uncertainty, we went ahead and finished
some projects on our own roof tops (Transcript, 18 June 2019, p. 432, 1. 12 to p. 432, Il. 4-18).
148 The European Union (“EU”) had agreed to provide up to €3 million for the Carriacou Wind Project, pending a
successful tender. That offer of funding for the project has since expired. (Auguste, para. 19) The Claimants blame
lack of Government cooperation, but John Auguste, Senior Energy Officer in the Ministry of Finance, testified that
the Government assisted the Company in acquiring the land on Carriacou, at the Government’s own expense and the
company received several tenders none of which went ahead. Mr. Auguste testified that the Government was unable
to independently verify the alleged deviations, as GRENLEC did not allow the Government's steering committee for
the project to review the tenders. (Ex. RE-0053 and Auguste, para. 20).

139. The Claimants argue that in fact the 1994 ESA created substantial incentives for GRENLEC
to introduce renewables.'*! Renewable sources now support more than 7% of
GRENLEC’s peak demand.'** To the extent that GRENLEC is required to consume less
diesel fuel, 90% of the fuel e

  

iency savings accrue to GRENLEC (the company was
required to pass the remaining 10% through to its consumers). This formula provided an
incentive for GRENLEC to substitute fossil fuel generation with renewable sources!** and
GRENLEC has attempted to do so. Over the years GRENLEC has identified a number of
renewable energy projects which, the Claimants say, were “thwarted” by the GOG, and in
particular by the NNP party when in power,'™ including efforts to access land for utility-
scale solar facilities, '° an incomplete wind power project on the island of Carriacou'** and

a promising geothermal site.'°7

140. The Tribunal concludes on the evidence that neither the Claimants nor the Government
pursued renewable energy proposals with as much vigour as they now assert. Whatever
the respective merits of these dueling allegations, the Respondent was unable to identify

any statutory or contractual obligation on the part of GRENLEC (or the Claimants) to

as potential sources of energy. GRENLEC also worked with the Grenada Solid Waste Management Authority to
launch a waste-to-energy project. (Reply Memorial, para. 74)

develop renewable energy.'** Again, GRENLEC under the guidance of WRB may have
fallen short of what might be expected of a good corporate citizen, but the root of the
problem is the decision of the NDC Government in 1994 to create the regulatory
framework which the NNP Government now considers “toothless” and the 1994 failure to
set performance standards for renewable energy which, with the benefit of hindsight, would

have promoted its development.

The Claimants’ Submission That One or More Elements of the 2016 Legislation
Constituted a “Repurchase Event”
The Claimants contend that the 2016 legislation fundamentally altered the 1994 bargain in

at least three ways:

(a) the 1994 rate setting mechanism, which until 2016 operated predictably according
to a statutory formula, was replaced with a regulatory procedure administered by

the PURC. The jurisdiction of the PURC includes a public interest discretion;

(b) the abolition of the tax exemption will necessarily result in higher capital and

operating costs going forward;

(c) the termination of the 80-year monopoly and the substitution of a shorter and
narrower period of exclusivity made GRENLEC shares a fundamentally different

investment than in 1994.

In subsequent pleadings, the Claimants did not pursue the alleged Repurchase Events
associated with the rate-setting mechanism or the tax exemption but concentrated on what

it claimed was an abrogation of GRENLEC’s 80-year monopoly and associated rights.

The Respondent concedes that the 2016 “restructuring package” might otherwise constitute
a Repurchase Event as a result of abrogation of the monopoly but, Section 7.9(a)(iv) of the
SPA permits Government to intervene in the monopoly where the Claimants have

“committed extreme or wilful malfeasance in, or abandonment of, its management of

'58 See Rejoinder, para. 98.

- 56-

GRENLEC of such a nature and to such a degree as warrants” such Government action

with regard to the licence. !°

144. Accordingly, the Tribunal turns to the issue of whether the 2016 impairment of the
GRENLEC monopoly is negated by the alleged “extreme or wilful malfeasance” on the

part of the Claimants.
(dd) Particulars of the Allegations of “Extreme or Wilful Malfeasance”

145. The Respondent says generally that from the very inception of the Claimants’ investment,
their actions show they never intended to be a genuine partner of the Government in the
operation of the utility. Instead, at every turn, the Claimants have operated the Company
so as to extract the highest return for themselves, without heed to the protests and warnings
of the local directors or other shareholders, or indeed, the long-term viability of GRENLEC

itself.' In particular:

(a) GRENLEC’s first major purchase under the Claimants’ control was two Caterpillar

generator units. The purchase was made without consultation with the rest of the

159 Tn full, Section 7.9(a)(iv) provides that the listed “occurrences or circumstance:
include:

‘eferred to as Repurchase Events”

  

any annulment, cancellation, limitation infringement or other impairment of the term, scope or exclusivity of

the GRENLEC Licence (any such action hereinafter referred to as a “GOG Action”), unless such GOG

Action is taken pursuant to and in accordance with any final and binding order issued by the Centre (as that

term is defined in Section 11.2) following the conclusion of an arbitration of a Dispute between the Parties

pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.2, which order holds that Buyer [GPP] has

committed extreme or wilful malfeasance in, or abandonment of, its management of GRENLEC of such a

nature and to such a degree as warrants such GOG Action (taking into account the economic consequences

to GRENLEC and Buyer of implementing and enforcing such GOG Action without requirement of payment

by the GOG in accordance with this Section 7.9). (Ex. RE-0089, s. 7.9(a)(iv)).
160 Counter-Memorial, para. 187. The Respondent says that Grenadian electricity rates rank among the highest in the
world. (Ex. CE-0042, at p. 10 (“Electricity prices in Grenada, as in many other small islands states in the Caribbean,
rank among the highest in the world. As of March 2015, they stood at around EC $1.00/kWh, even without considering
additional environmental levies and value-added taxes.”)) For example, from January 2011 to December 2014,
electricity prices in Grenada varied between USD $0.50 and USD $0.68 per kilowatt hour, while prices in the United
States over the same period were between USD $0.07 and USD $0.12 per kilowatt hour — between four and ten times
less expensive than in Grenada. (Ex. CE-0039, at p. 5.) Moreover, the country, one of the largest consumers of energy
in the Eastern Caribbean, is almost wholly reliant on imported fossil fuels. (Ex. Re-0038 at p. 52) This combination
of dependence and high costs has significant consequences for Grenada’s economy. As the International Renewable
Energy Agency (“IRENA”) concluded in 2012, “slow economic growth, declining [foreign direct investment] and
stagnant remittances, coupled with the country’s high dependence on imported fossil fuels, have significantly
hampered the country’s growth.” (Ex. RE-0041, at p. 21) The World Bank interviewed private enterprises in 2010 and
found that “electricity costs were ranked as one of the biggest obstacles to doing business in most OECS countries”
(Ex. RE-0052, at 29).

(2) The Contested Definition of “Extreme or Wilful Malfeasance”

147. The Respondent points out that “extreme” or “wilful” are divided by the disjuncture
“or’,!73 and therefore “malfeasance” (which the Respondent argues is equivalent to

nya

“misconduct’ need not be “extreme” but merely “wilful”. Thus the test is satisfied by

“any form of intentional or reckless conduct that is wrongful or unlawful.” !75

148. According to the Claimants, basic principles of contract interpretation require the phrase
to be read in context and in light of the words that accompany it.'7° The presence of the
word “extreme” in the definition, which must be read as a whole, points to the high level
of misconduct required to satisfy the test. The words “extreme” and “wilful” signal a
requirement for intentional acts of egregious mismanagement. Moreover, the wrongdoing
(malfeasance) must be so serious as to justify the correspondingly grave consequence
(impairment or annulment of the GRENLEC Licence) and deprivation of Second

Schedule compensation. !””

149. In the Tribunal’s view, the key to the interpretation is not the difference between “wilful
misconduct” and “egregious mismanagement” but is the requirement of proportionality
(i.e. “so serious as to justify the correspondingly grave consequence”). While the Parties
are correct that the conduct must be “wilful” and improper, even “egregious”, these terms
are somewhat subjective, whereas the “consequence” has been quantified by the experts.

The Respondent’s expert, Mr. Mudge, says that using the fair market value approach, the

‘73 The SPA requires the Respondent to demonstrate that the Claimants committed extreme or wilful malfeasance in,
or abandonment of, its management of GRENLEC of such a nature and to such a degree as warrants such GOG action
(taking into account the economic consequences to GRENLEC and [GPP] of implementing and enforcing such GOG
action without requirement of payment by the GOG in accordance with this section.)

174 Counter-Memorial, para. 186.

175 Tbid.. The Respondent relies on the English case of Forder v. Great Western Railway Co [1904-7] All ER Rep Ext
1352 (Ex. RLA-0001), at 1357, which held that wilful misconduct is to act “with reckless carelessness, not caring
what the results of [the] carelessness may be”.

176 See e.g., Arnold v. Britton and others [2015] UKSC 36 (Ex. RLA-0060), para. 15 (“[The] meaning [of a contractual
provision] has to be assessed in the light of [inter alia] (i) the natural and ordinary meaning of the clause, (ii) any other
relevant provisions of the lease[.]”).

 

‘77 Tm deciding whether this seriousness threshold is met, SPA Section 7.9(a)(iv) requires the Tribunal to “tak[e] into
account the economic consequences to GRENLEC and [GPP] of implementing and enforcing such GOG Action
without requirement of payment by the GOG in accordance with this Section 7.9.” (Ex. RE-0089)

claims should be valued at no more than EC $127 million.'”* The Claimants’ expert, Mr.
Ellison, assesses Schedule Two compensation at EC $361.882 million.'”? The difference
(“the consequence”) is EC $235 million. The Tribunal must therefore weigh whether the
allegations, if proven, either individually or collectively justify a consequent reduction (to

put it at its highest) of EC $234.8 million.

The Tribunal will therefore turn to the issue whether any of the allegations of “wilful

malfeasance”, if established, justify the consequence sought by the Respondent.

Do any of the Particulars of the Alleged Malfeasance Individually or Collectively
Justify Denial of Repurchase Obligation?

(wD The Purchase of Two Caterpillar MaK Generators

The Respondent alleges that WRB had a conflict of interest in causing GRENLEC to
purchase electrical generators from Caterpillar while bypassing proper procedures and
board approval. Shortly after installation, both units experienced “severe problems,” with
significant adverse impact on Grenada’s electricity supply.'*° Caterpillar has admitted the
severity and extent of the problems. In a settlement agreement signed in 2001 between
Caterpillar and GRENLEC, Caterpillar had to entirely replace one engine and do extensive
work to convert the other, “at its sole cost and expense,” and to give GRENLEC a further
discount of USD $1 million on the purchase price in exchange for the release of all claims
relating to the generators, “including [their] performance, functionality, durability or
reliability.” '*!

As to proper process, the Claimants respond that the purchase was based on a tendering
protocol recommended by the consultant, Bushea (who admittedly had done work

previously for the WRB group), and approved by the EIB.'*? The Claimants deny that any

member of the WRB group of companies or any member of the Blanchard family received

any personal benefit from GRENLEC’s purchase and there is no evidence to the contrary.

153. The Minutes of the GRENLEC Board of Directors record deliberations on the Caterpillar

transaction during multiple Board meetings. !*°

154. In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent has failed to establish any conflict of interest. If,
contrary to the Claimants’ argument, there were any procedural irregularities in making the
purchase, they did not amount to “wilful malfeasance”. On the merits, the transaction came

within reasonable business judgment.
(2) Excessive Dividend Payments

155. |The Respondent complains that “WRB has repeatedly used its control of the [GRENLEC]
Board to issue dividend payments without the approval of non-WRB Board members.”!**
There is no doubt that the Claimants used their control of the GRENLEC Board to maintain

a substantial dividend stream.

156. |The Claimants emphasize that the dividends were issued to all shareholders (of which the
Claimants represented about 60%) including the Government. The Board has the power

to declare dividends by a majority vote.!*>

157. As to the 2016 Special Dividend, the Claimants rely on the GRENLEC Articles of
Association which provide that “directors may from time to time pay to the member such
interim dividends as appears to the directors to be justified by the profits[.]”!®° The Articles
of Association do not refer to profits of any particular year but necessarily to accumulated

profits'®” (or retained earnings). The Claimants say the Respondent’s singular focus on

183 See e.g., Minutes of the 218th Meeting of the Board of Directors of GRENLEC, 9 January 1996 (Ex. CE-0075);
Minutes of the 219" Meeting of the Board of Directors of GRENLEC, 5 March 1996 (Ex. CE-0076); Minutes of the
233" Meeting of the Board of Directors of GRENLEC, 14 June 1999 (Ex. CE-0092).

cash is misconceived. At the time of payment of the Special Dividend, GRENLEC’s

retained earnings exceeded the Special Dividend by EC $12 million.'**

The Claimants argue that GRENLEC’s decision to finance part of the Special Dividend via
the CIBC Loan made good business sense because of low interest rates. The CIBC Loan
realigned GRENLEC’s capital mix with its historical average. '*? GRENLEC remains in a
position to repay the loan,'*? and details about the loan were appropriately disclosed in
GRENLEC’s annual report.!?! Moreover, the Claimants argue the Special Dividend in fact
reduced the amount of the Claimants’ claim in this arbitration by precisely the same

amount that the Claimants received. '°”

In the Tribunal’s view, the dividend issue is another manifestation of the Parties’ differing
views of GRENLEC’s “social” responsibility. The Respondent believes that GRENLEC
ought as a “good” corporate citizen to have ploughed more of the profits back into the
business for much needed infrastructure and, in particular, renewable energy. The
Claimants argue that they have indeed been good corporate citizens but that, realistically,
their investment was intended to make money for the shareholders or investors and they
acted accordingly. GRENLEC’s dividend policy, including the special dividend, did not
contravene any corporate contractual or statutory requirement. The Respondent has not
established that the dividend policy pursued by the Claimants demonstrated “wilful

malfeasance”.

It was suggested that s. 241(2) of the Grenadian Companies Act might have been utilized
by the GRENLEC shareholders other than the WRB majority (including the GOG with

available for distribution are its accumulated, realised profits.” Ibid., s. 830 (emphasis added). See also Re Spanish
Prospecting Co, Ltd., [1908-10] All ER Rep 573 (Ex. CLA-0062), at 580. (“Money which has in fact resulted from
profits made in trading is none the less profit because it is carried over to a suspense account or reserve fund...[I]t
remains as undistributed profits.”).

188 Retained earnings at the end of 2015 were EC $69 million (GRENLEC Annual Report 2015 (Ex. CE-0152), at 28)
and the Special Dividend was EC $57 million (GRENLEC Annual Report 2016 (Ex. RE-0077), at p. 55).

189 GRENLEC’s average debt-to-equity ratio between 1999 and 2015 was 0.73 to 1. At the end of 2015, GRENLEC’s
debt-to-equity ratio was 0.24 to 1. See Blanchard II, para. 80.

190 Debt service payments were in fact reduced from those prior to the CIBC Loan (Board Paper — Fourth Quarter

10%) to remedy conduct “without valid corporate purpose” or that “discriminates between
shareholders with the effect of benefitting the majority” or with “lack of adequate and
appropriate disclosure of material information to minority shareholders” but there is no

evidence that such remedy was ever sought in the courts of Grenada. !°3

In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent has not established that the dividend policy imposed

on GRENLEC by the Claimants amounted to “wilful malfeasance”.
(3) Refusal to Promote Development of Renewable Energy

The lack of serious development of renewable energy is an important matter for the
development of Grenada’s economy. However, the Claimants gave evidence of serious
efforts in that regard. While the Claimants and the Government blame each other for the
lack of progress, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondent’s allegation that the lack of

success was “wilful” or that the history of these efforts demonstrate “malfeasance”.

(4) GRENLEC’s Payment of Fees of Legal and Forensic Accounting Consultant
Benefitted the Claimants not GRENLEC

The Respondent argues that the Claimants committed wilful malfeasance by causing

GRENLEC to fund legal expense during the initial stages of this arbitration as well as

KPMG’s advisory quantum report'™ used to justify the Claimants’ initial demand for USD

$65,428,923 “payable within 30 days”.

The Claimants say the Board voted in favor of funding “the initial stages of this arbitration

in the hope of persuading Respondent to negotiate mutually-acceptable regulatory

'°3 Grenadian Companies Act (Ex. RE-0007), No. 35 of 1994, s. 241:

debenture holder, creditor, director or officer of the company, the court may make an order to rectify the
matters complained of.

reforms” which would allow the Claimants to continue their investment.!°° GRENLEC,
they say, was entitled to defend itself in light of the dramatic impact of the 2016 reform
package on GRENLEC’s business. To achieve impact, the Claimants’ demand had to be
accompanied by the KPMG “advisory” report supporting the high cost of a buy-out.
Management hoped, according to the Claimants, that a negotiated solution would allow
GRENLEC to continue in business on the basis of the 1994 privatization regardless of
whether the Claimants’ shares were repurchased by the Government. The Claimants recall
the experience of the first ICSID arbitration in 1997 which led to a negotiated settlement

which restored GRENLEC’s monopoly and privileges.

The Claimants acknowledge that by the end of 2017, it was clear that Respondent had no
interest in pursuing a negotiated solution; accordingly, GRENLEC stopped paying legal

and expert fees related to this arbitration. !°°

In the Tribunal’s view, the first point to make is that whatever basis might otherwise have
existed to justify GRENLEC’s retainer of outside legal counsel to assess the impact of the
2016 laws on its business, the fact is the Claimants had already issued the current Notice
of Arbitration on 5 May 2017 seeking compensation for the Claimants not GRENLEC.
The dominant purpose of the legal work was to advance the Claimants’ claim. GRENLEC
continued to pay legal fees until the end of 2017, which was well beyond anything that

could be justified, even on the Claimants’ view of the facts.

Moreover, in the Tribunal’s view, there was no justification for GRENLEC to fund the
work of forensic accountants KPMG whose mandate was to calculate and justify the
amount of the Claimants’ compensation. The benefit to GRENLEC as a negotiating tool
with the Government was marginal at best. The Claimants’ quantum expert, Mr. John
Ellison, acknowledged that the work product reflected in his report put before this Tribunal
was “largely the same” as the KPMG work product undertaken for its original 2017

“indicative valuation report”:

Q. Okay. You would agree with me, though, that the work product
reflected in the Ellison/Popovic Report is virtually the same as the work
product in the Indicative Valuation Report that had been produced a year
earlier?

A. Well, it’s largely the same. I wouldn’t say “virtually,” but it’s largely
the same.

Q. I’m willing to concede on that one word. That may be the only point
we agree on for the entire cross-examination.

So, largely the same, and that had been the work product that at least as
far as we’ ve discussed in this Hearing that GRENLEC had paid for?

A. Yes, that’s right.!°”

In effect, the GOG as shareholder was being required to fund in part the litigation against

itself.

However, while such payments demonstrate (as the Respondent alleges) conflation by
WRB of GRENLEC’s interest and WRB’s interest, they do not amount to such “extreme
or wilful malfeasance” as to justify denying the Claimants compensation under Schedule
Two. The issue of reimbursement to GRENLEC for improperly charged fees and

disbursements is dealt with below.
(5) GRENLEC’s Constitutional Claim Against the Government

The Respondent asserts that the Claimants caused GRENLEC to bring “a nominal

claim challenged a December 2017 amendment to the 2016 ESA mandating that
GRENLEC henceforth pay 5% of its pre-tax profits to the Government to be devoted to

whatever purposes a committee appointed by the GOG may decide. !*

The Tribunal’s view is that the purpose of GRENLEC’s claim, whatever its legal merit,
was to benefit GRENLEC. Any indirect benefit to the Claimants would have the same, on
a per share basis, as the benefit to the GOG. GRENLEC litigation for the benefit of

GRENLEC does not constitute “wilful malfeasance” by the Claimants in the management

of GRENLEC”” justifying a denial of Second Schedule compensation.
(6) The Management Agreement Fees

The Management Agreement”! requires WRB to provide GRENLEC with a variety of

4 202
management services.

The Respondent contends that the Claimants improperly extended control of the day-to-
day management of GRENLEC to ensure that GRENLEC was managed for the benefit of
WRB rather than Grenada. In part the Government contends that the management role was
abused by WRB to decide issues free of scrutiny by the Board of Directors on which sat

the local directors.

The Claimants respond that access to “specialized management services” was one of the
key reasons that the Government sought a strategic partner to purchase a controlling stake
in GRENLEC.”°? Many of the top jobs have subsequent to 1994 been filled by Grenadians
and the management training process continues to be a work in progress. The Claimants
point out that the “modest annual fee” (approximately USD $222,000) has not increased in
22 years despite periods when GRENLEC required significantly greater involvement by
WRB personnel, such as in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma.” The Respondent says that

competent Grenadians were available years ago to take the top management jobs.

In the Tribunal’s view, the assessment of a need for ongoing management services was a
matter of business judgment. There is no evidence that Grenadians were denied top jobs
for improper reasons. The Claimants have a large investment in GRENLEC’s performance

and the decision to continue management services at USD $220,000 per year does not

200 Tn its argumentation on “wilful malfeasance,” the Respondent asserts that GRENLEC’s constitutional law claim is
“in contravention of the Claimants’ agreement to arbitrate [under the SPA].” Counter-Memorial, para. 194. This is
illogical, as GRENLEC is not a party to the SPA and is not invoking the SPA as a legal basis for its claims.

amount to extreme or wilful malfeasance on the part of WRB (even under the Respondent’s

broad definition of the term) to justify denial of Second Schedule compensation.

The Causation Issue

The Claimants argue that in order to rely on the “wilful malfeasance” exception, the
Respondent must show that the wilful malfeasance caused the GOG to abrogate of the
GRENLEC monopoly. The 2016 “restructuring package” was the result of politics not
management deficiencies. Allegations of malfeasance came as an afterthought in response

to commencement of the present arbitration.

The Respondent says the allegations of malfeasance are of long-standing nature, as
evidenced by the charges made against the Claimants by the local directors that are the
subject of the ongoing “fiduciary” lawsuit. Whether or not the words “extreme or wilful
malfeasance” were used is of no consequence. There is evidence of numerous stand-offs
between GRENLEC (as directed by WRB) and the GOG including the Claimants’

resistance to the development of renewable energy and its divisive dividend policy.

The Claimants argue that the allegations of “wilful malfeasance” are not authentic but are
merely the ex post facto product of lawyers casting around for a defence to a pending ICSID
claim. In a letter to WRB, the Claimants argue, the Respondent acknowledged that the

decision to abrogate the GRENLEC monopoly was political:

In view of the implications for job creation, foreign direct investment, the
overall development of the economy of Grenada and the international
commitment of the Government to the production of cleaner and more
renewable energy, it is imperative that relevant changes are made to
pertinent legislation and attendant regulations. The Government considers
that the public interest must be viewed as overriding to the interests of
WRB/GRENLEC...?°°

Significantly, the Claimants say, there are no documents communicated to the Claimants

alleging “wilful malfeasance” and the Government’s willingness in 2016 and 2017 to

continue WRB’s stewardship of GRENLEC on 2016 terms indicates clearly that

“malfeasance” was not an issue.

The Tribunal concludes on the evidentiary record that the GOG believed in good faith
that it had many good policy reasons to take back control of GRENLEC but wilful
malfeasance was not on its list of reasons. This is not to say that the GOG and the local
Directors were satisfied with the Claimants’ performance. Undoubtedly the Claimants’
determination to manage the GRENLEC monopoly to the advantage of the WRB
shareholders gave cause, as the Respondent saw the situation, for dissatisfaction. However,
dissatisfaction generated by the Claimants’ exercise of contractual rights does not translate
into “wilful malfeasance”. The 2016 restructuring package was clearly motivated (i.e.
caused) by the NNP Government’s public policy objectives, which differed from those of
the prior NDC Government, not any malfeasance (belatedly alleged) on the part of the
Claimants. There were (and are) numerous allegations of management deficiencies laid at
the door of WRB but, applying the proportionality test called for by the SPA, and whether
viewed individually or collectively, they do not justify denial of Second Schedule

compensation.

The Claimants Contend that the Malfeasance Argument is Procedurally Inadmissible

Section 7.9(a)(iv) of the SPA provides that “any annulment, cancellation, limitation or
other impairment of the term, scope or exclusivity of the GRENLEC Licence” constitutes
a Repurchase Event, unless “taken pursuant to and in accordance with any final and
binding order issued by” an ICSID tribunal upholding an allegation of extreme or wilful

malfeasance.7°°

ection 7.9(a)(iv) reads in relevant part:

[A]ny annulment, cancellation, limitation infringement or other impairment of the term, scope or exclusivity
of the GRENLEC Licence (any such action hereinafter referred to as a “GOG Action”) [constitutes a
Repurchase Event], unless such GOG Action is taken pursuant to and in accordance with any final and
binding order issued by [ICSID] following the conclusion of an arbitration of a Dispute between the Parties
pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.2, which order holds that Buyer has
committed extreme or wilful malfeasance in, or abandonment of, its management of GRENLEC of such a
nature and to such a degree as warrants such GOG Action (taking into account the economic consequences
to GRENLEC and Buyer of implementing and enforcing such GOG Action without requirement of payment
by the GOG in accordance with this Section 7.9). (SPA (Ex. CE-0007/RE-0089), s. 7.9(a)(iv))

The Respondent does not dispute that only a finding of wilful malfeasance by an ICSID
tribunal will definitively bar WRB and GPP from recovery on this ground.2°’ However,
the Respondent argues that the reference to an ICSID Tribunal includes this Tribunal and
that whether that finding is made before or after the Government’s abrogation of the
monopoly is immaterial. If wilful malfeasance is established, the Respondent argues, the
timing and sequence of the ICSID orders are irrelevant to the purpose served by Section
7.9(a)(iv) which is “to preclude Claimants from forcing a share repurchase where they had
themselves committed wilful malfeasance.”

Imposition of an ICSID award as a condition precedent to abrogation makes no commercial
sense, the Respondent argues, as the double hearing would impose increased costs, undue
delay, and put an unnecessary administrative burden on the Government, and yield no

discernible benefit in the performance of the contract.7”

The Respondent relies upon UK Supreme Court decision in Rainy Sky SA v. Kookmin Bank
for the proposition that “it is ‘not necessary to conclude that a particular construction [of
an agreement] would produce an absurd or irrational result before having regard to the

999210

commercial purpose of the agreement as well as Lord Diplock’s dictum in Antaios

Compania Naviera S.A. v. Salen Rederierna A.B.:*"!

...[I]f detailed semantic and syntactical analysis of words in a commercial
contract is going to lead to a conclusion that flouts business common
sense, it must be made to yield to business common sense. (emphasis
added)

207 Counter-Memorial, para. 181.

208 Thid., para. 179.

2 The Respondent says it is nonsensical to require it: “(i) initiate ICSID arbitration proceedings seeking declaratory
relief; (ii) mount a full case to prove that Claimants were wilfully malfeasant, in the face of undoubtedly vigorous
opposition; (iii) obtain an award finding wilful malfeasance; and then (iv) enact the reforms long recommended by
international experts and desperately needed to bring Grenada in line with modern standards—only to find itself back
before an ICSID tribunal when Claimants inevitably sought to compel repurchase on any of the other grounds, which
do not have the wilful malfeasance exception set out in Section 7.9(a)(iv). [The] Claimants could have no legitimate
purpose in forcing the Government to incur such cost, delay, and burden. Instead, considerations of efficacy and
reasonableness counsel that the application of this exception is best determined in precisely the posture in which it is
now presented to the Tribunal. (/bid., paras. 183-184).

Moreover, the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal in Grenada Tech*'* held that the proper

interpretation of an agreement should not be limited to the plain text.7!7

The Claimants respond generally that the text of the clause means what it says and that the
Tribunal has no authority to rewrite the procedure agreed to by the Parties. In the decisions
relied on by the Respondent, the court found (unlike here) the text to be ambiguous?! and
cite the decision of the UK Supreme Court in Arnold v. Britton and others for the

proposition that:

[T]he clearer the natural meaning the more difficult it is to justify
departing from it...[WJ]hile commercial common sense is a very important
factor to take into account when interpreting a contract, a court should be
very slow to reject the natural meaning of a provision as correct simply
because it appears to be a very imprudent term for one of the parties to
have agreed, even ignoring the benefit of wisdom of hindsight. The
purpose of interpretation is to identify what the parties have agreed, not
what the court thinks that they should have agreed.?!5

In the Claimants’ view, Section 7.9(a)(iv) is clear and unambiguous. In order to rely on
the “malfeasance” exception, the Respondent must first obtain an order from an ICSID
tribunal finding that GPP committed “wilful malfeasance” of such nature and to such a
degree as warrants impairment of the GRENLEC Licence without obligation to make
Second Schedule Compensation, and only after obtaining such an order (‘following the
conclusion” of the arbitration proceedings) can the Respondent annul or impair the
GRENLEC Licence (“pursuant to and in accordance with” the ICSID tribunal’s order)

without triggering a Repurchase Event.

The purpose of this requirement, the Claimants say, is to protect the Claimants against
“precisely the sort of situation that pertains here, where Respondent opportunistically, and

without legitimate aims, asserts wilful malfeasance ex post facto.”?'®

In the Tribunal’s view, the text clearly requires a prior ICSID determination to that effect
before not after a licence abrogation in order for the defence of “extreme or wilful
malfeasance” to apply. The abrogation is to follow not precede the conclusion of the initial
ICSID arbitration. The Tribunal has no authority to re-write the procedural steps necessary
to invoke the “malfeasance” provision as sought by the Respondent. That provision is not
only of benefit to the Claimants. It provides the Government with an opportunity to test
its allegations of wilful malfeasance risk-free before an ICSID Tribunal without triggering
a Repurchase event. Otherwise a Government that is deeply unhappy with the investor
would have to plunge ahead with its restructuring, thereby triggering the Claimants’ prima
facie right to Second Schedule compensation and only afterwards, having committed itself
to a repurchase, would the Government get to argue about the defence of wilful
malfeasance. As in the present case, the Government’s legislative abrogation, once
launched, could not be recalled. Under the two-stage process the Government would have
the opportunity for sober second thoughts if the ICSID Tribunal ruled in favor of the
investors on the issue of wilful malfeasance. The Government might decide to live with
what it views as an unsatisfactory situation rather than pay the price of terminating the

relationship.

Whether or not the two-step process is sensible commercial practice was for the Parties,
not this Tribunal, to decide. The two-stage process was capable of compliance but the
Respondent chose not to initiate the first stage. The malfeasance issue only surfaced in a
formal way when it came time to defend the Claimants’ repurchase demand. The

procedural objection alone is fatal to the Respondent’s “wilful malfeasance” defence.

Conclusion on Liability

The Claimants effectively abandoned the alleged Repurchase Events other than abrogation

of the monopoly.?!”

2!7 See Reply Memorial, para. 118, note 269 “In the interest of judicial economy, and because of the strength and
simplicity of the Repurchase Event under Section 7.9(a)(iv), Claimants will not pursue further these two additional

Repurchase Events at this s

 

ge. Claimants nonetheless reserve the right to revive their claim in thi:

 

respect at a later

date as the Government takes further actions to implement the 2016 ESA.”; Rejoinder, paras. 142-145.

For the forgoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have established a
“Repurchase Event” by the GOG’s abrogation of GRENLEC’s 80-year monopoly.”'® The
abrogation was not caused by “wilful malfeasance”. These conclusions are sufficient to
dispose of the issue of liability. Accordingly, the Claimants were entitled to “put” their

GRENLEC shares to the Respondent for repurchase and the payment of compensation.

The next issue is to determine the basis on which compensation is to be assessed.

ARE THE CLAIMANTS’ ENTITLED TO SECOND SCHEDULE
COMPENSATION?
The Claimants rely on Section 7.9(b) of the SPA and the Second Schedule of the 1994 ESA
(together, the “Repurchase Demand Calculation”). Section 7.9(a)(iv) defines one such
Repurchase Event as:

any annulment, cancellation, limitation, infringement or other impairment
of the term, scope or exclusivity of the GRENLEC License.

The SPA goes on to state in Section 7.9(b):

The GOG agrees that it shall within thirty (30) days following demand by
[the] Buyer upon the occurrence of a Repurchase Event, purchase and
acquire all GRENLEC shares then owned by [the] Buyer...the
purchase price payable in such event shall be calculated on the basis
specified in the Second Schedule to the ESA as in effect on the Closing
Date. (emphasis added)?!”

The Respondent says the purchase price must be assessed by reference to the fair market
value of the shares under the most recent legal regime governing GRENLEC, the 2016
ESA.”° The Second Schedule is legally ineffective and unenforceable under Grenadian

law, the Respondent says, because:

2!8 Section 7.9(a)(iv) of the SPA is engaged in the event of an “annulment, cancellation, limitation, infringement or
other impairment of the term, scope or exclusivity of the GRENLEC Licence.” See Ex. RE-0089, s. 7.9(a)(iv).

(a) first, as a matter of contract law, the provisions constitute an unlawful and

unenforceable penalty;

(b) second, as a matter of constitutional law, the provisions are void and of no legal
effect because they fetter Government action contrary to fundamental principles

enshrined in the Constitution of Grenada.

The Second Schedule in the SPA is taken with modifications from the Second Schedule of
the 1960 ESO,”! which applied only where the Government revoked the licence. The
mechanism created by the 1994 SPA and 1994 ESA changed the 1960 formula in important

respects as follows:

(a) the SPA repurchase obligation lists an extensive list of repurchase events that fall

short of revocation;722

(b) the 1960 arrangement required compensation for goodwill only during the first 40
years of the licence.7> The 1994 ESA and SPA require payment for goodwill
throughout the entire duration of the licence for all but a Repurchase Event arising

under Section 7.9(xi) — that is, for an “act of God”.?*4

Is the Repurchase obligation to pay Second Schedule Compensation Valid?
The Respondent argues?*> that Grenadian law governs the SPA and enforcement of its
contractually prescribed remedy is invalid because it is exorbitant, unconscionable and out

of proportion to the Claimants’ legitimate interest in payment for the GRENLEC shares.?°

221 Compare Ex. CE-0005, with Ex. CE-0025; supra, para. 49.

222 Ex, RE-0089, s. 7.9(a).

24 Ex, RE-0089, s. 7.9(b) (“no [repurchase] payment in respect of a Repurchase Event arising under Section 7.9(xi)

shall include recovery of amounts calculated pursuant to Part II of the Second Schedule to the ESA as in effect on the
Closing Date”).

Counter-Memorial, para. 202.

26 Halsbury’s Laws of England: Damages (Volume 29 (2014) (Ex. RLA-0032), at 8.(5)(i)(549):

If a clause goes beyond a mere liquidated damages provision, so as to be unconscionable and calculated more
to discourage breach than facilitate compensation, it is invalid as a ‘penalty’. The justification for this
practice.. has been variously described as a matter of public policy and a means for the prevention of
oppression. Today the best view is that the penalties rule exists in order to suppress unconscionable business
conduct not otherwise commercially justified.”

-74-

The rule against penalties is applicable to liquidated amounts payable, as here, under a

contract of purchase and sale of shares where the purchaser refuses to complete the

transaction.

197. In any event, the provisions are void and of no legal effect because the requirement to pay

Second Schedule Compensation was designed to fetter the Governments ability to regulate

Grenada’s electricity sector in the public interes:

198. The Claimants respond that while the SPA is generally to be governed and construed in

accordance with Grenadian law:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

the Respondent is estopped from contesting the validity of the terms of a contract
that it has repeatedly affirmed over the past quarter century, and the benefit of

which it has freely and fully accepted;

even if there is no estoppel, the provisions of the SPA expressly exclude the
application of Grenadian law that might serve to invalidate the Repurchase

Obligation;

in any event, the Respondent misconceives the rule against penalties which does
not permit courts and tribunals to rewrite terms of purchase agreed to by
sophisticated parties. The rule against penalties operates only when assessing
damages for a breach of contract (e.g. where there is a liquidated damages clause)

not for specific performance of a contract of purchase and sale;

the requirement of Second Schedule compensation does not fetter Government
action but specifically contemplates Government action at a time of the
Government’s choosing provided only that the contractual compensation is

subsequently paid; and

international law precludes the Respondent from invoking its domestic

constitutional principles to avoid its commitments to the Claimants.

B. The Claimants Contend that the Respondent is Estopped by its Conduct from
Disputing the Validity of the Second Schedule Methodology

199. The Claimants argue that the Respondent is estopped under international law from
contesting the SPA Repurchase Obligation. They say the doctrine of estoppel under
international law prohibits a party from “opportunistically” changing its position to the
detriment of another.** A party “who has voluntarily assented to a contract and openly
reaffirmed its validity [cannot] thereafter oppose its performance or its ultimate juridical

effect.””? The same doctrine exists under common law.?*°

200. The Respondent represented and warranted in Sections 4.3 and 4.4 of the SPA that the
SPA, including its Repurchase Obligation, was valid and enforceable under Grenadian

Law, as follows:

This Agreement has been, and the documents to be delivered by the GOG
at Closing will be, duly executed and delivered by the GOG and constitute
the lawful, valid and legally binding obligations of the GOG,
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms.7*!

The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby...(ii) are not prohibited by and do
not violate or constitute a default under any contract, agreement or other
instrument to which GRENLEC or the GOG is a party, or any provision
of Grenadian Law applicable to GRENLEC or the GOG.”* (emphasis
added)

Mr. Blanchard, the CEO of WRB, testified that without these representations and
warranties, the Claimants would never have entered into the SPA and would never have

invested the initial capital.?*

The Claimants also rely on the terms of the Supplemental SPA that the Parties concluded
when agreeing to settle their first ICSID arbitration under the SPA. The only change to the
SPA that Respondent sought at the time was to exclude “hurricanes” from the list of
Repurchase Events.*** Otherwise, “the SPA shall remain in full force and effect.” Mr.
Blanchard testified that WRB relied on these representations in continuing to invest time

and effort in GRENLEC.?*°

According to the Claimants, the Respondent cannot now claim in good faith that two core
provisions of the SPA — the Repurchase Obligation and carve-out of inconsistent

Grenadian Law provisions — are “legally ineffective and unenforceable.””°°

237

The Claimants rely in particular on ADC v. Hungary~*’ where foreign investors and a

Hungarian state agency had entered into a series of agreements for the renovation,
construction, and operation of two terminals at Budapest International Airport.
The Tribunal held that Hungary was estopped from relying on Hungarian law to contest
the validity of these agreements because (as here) “[t]hese Agreements were entered into

years ago and both parties ha[d] acted on the basis that all was in order”:

[W]hen, after receiving top class international legal advice, Hungary
enters into and performs these agreements for years and takes the full
benefit from them, it lies ill in the mouth of Hungary now to challenge the
legality and/or enforceability of these Agreements. ...Hungary entered into
these agreements willingly, took advantage from them and led the
Claimants over a long period of time, to assume that these Agreements
were effective. Hungary cannot now go behind these Agreements.”**

204. A number of other authorities were cited by the Claimants to the same effect.?°?

205. The Respondent says the authorities cited by the Claimants are inapplicable.
The Constitution is the supreme law of the country and is paramount to any other law
including the law of estoppel. The Parties were not free to contract out of a constitutional

prohibition and cannot be estopped from enforcing it.

206. Inthe Tribunal’s view, the Respondent is not estopped from denying liability for Second
Schedule compensation on the basis that it accepted the investment and lived with the
arrangement for over 22 years. It is noted that the Respondent does not challenge the SPA

generally. Its attack is focused on the Second Schedule compensation provisions.

207. Undoubtedly, the Claimants “relied” on the terms of the SPA and the Supplemental SPA
in the same way that any contracting party relies on the warranties and other terms of its
contract. There is no reason to doubt Mr. Blanchard’s evidence that without the whole
1994 package, WRB would not have made the initial investment. The situation with
respect to the 1997 Supplementary SPA is different because the investment had been made

and the evidence is that the Claimants made no subsequent contribution of capital.

208. Estoppel is generally relevant as a “shield” where an opposing party is seeking to enforce
rights to which it is otherwise entitled but is “estopped” from doing so by its collateral
representations or conduct. That is not this case. The Respondent is not seeking a benefit
under the SPA. There are no “representations” outside the representations, warranties and
undertakings in the SPA and Supplemental SPA. In respect of those “representations”,

the remedies lie in the law of contract not estoppel.

209. There is no evidence of reliance beyond the original purchase. Indeed one of the
Respondent’s complaints is that the Claimants have not lived up to an alleged promise “to

make EC $17 million worth of capital investments projected through the end of 1998.”

239 In Joannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia, ICSID Case No. ARB/0S5/18 (“Kardassopoulos v. Georgia”), Award

As to detriment, the continued investment has been very profitable. It will be recalled that
WRB “expected” that “substantially all of the earnings of GRENLEC will be required to
fund future capital investments to assure the long-term viability of GRENLEC”, which,

according to WRB, “will leave no funds available for dividend payments.” 74°

The simple fact that the agreement has stood for over two decades (despite the
Respondent’s 1997 challenge to its validity) does not immunize the SPA from having the

validity of its compensation provisions determined on the merits.

As a Matter of Contract, Does the SPA Successfully Exclude All Rules of Grenadian
Law that are Inconsistent with the Repurchase Obligation?

The Respondent argues that pursuant to Section 11.1, the SPA is to be governed by and
construed in accordance with Grenadian Law, a defined term that includes

“the Constitution of Grenada” and “the common law of Grenada.”74!

Accordingly,
enforcement of the SPA is subject to the prohibition against penalties and constitutional
compliance. The Respondent says the Second Schedule imposes an extravagantly
excessive monetary penalty on the exercise of the Government’s regulatory authority, and
thereby for all practical purposes fetters the exercise of that authority. The Second
Schedule formula for compensation is contrary to the constitution and common law of

Grenada.

The Claimants point out that Section 11.1 of the SPA expressly excludes the application of
any provision of Grenadian Law that is inconsistent with the Repurchase Obligation and

certain other provisions of the SPA:

This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Grenadian Law
(with the understanding that the provisions of Section 7.9 [the
Repurchase Obligation], Article X, and Sections 11.2, 11.3, 11.4 and
11.5 are intended by the Parties to control the implementation,
interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement with regard to the

-79 -

subject matter of said Sections notwithstanding inconsistent provisions
of Grenadian Law). (emphasis added)

213. Section 7.9(b) of the SPA reinforces this carve-out by providing that the Repurchase
Obligation is “irrevocable and unconditional,” irrespective of any objection or defence that

Respondent may raise under Grenadian Law:

The obligations of the GOG under this Section 7.9 with respect to any
Repurchase Event shall, subject to Section 7.9(c), be irrevocable and
unconditional regardless of...the invalidity or unenforceability of this
Agreement against the GOG,...or ...any other defence which the GOG
may from time-to-time to assert as a defence to any payment under this
Agreement in respect of a Repurchase Event, excepting only the defence
that the payment in question has been paid-in-full to Buyer when and as
required hereunder. (emphasis added)

214. The Claimants point out that Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, which governs this

244

arbitration,“ provides that “[t]he Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such

rules of law as may be agreed by the parties.”*4> The reference to “rules of law” permits
the parties to choose selectively, adopting some rules from the referenced legal system

while excluding the application of other rules from the same system.”*° The Parties’ choice

245 ICSID Convention (Ex. CLA-0010), Article 42(1):

The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties.
In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute
(including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.

 

46 The Claimants contend that this “cherry picking” is consistent with the negotiating history of Article 42(1). Aron
Broches (the World Bank’s General Counsel from 1959 to 1971 who led the negotiations that culminated in the 1965
ICSID Convention) observed that “[t]he reason for adopting this more flexible term [‘rules of law’] was to indicate,
among other things, that the parties are not limited to a choice of one or more national laws or legal systems, but
may, for example, ‘incorporate’ a national law as in existence on a certain date or exclude certain provisions of such
a law.” (See Aron Broches, Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of
Other States of 1965: Explanatory Notes and Survey of its Application, 18 Y.B. COMM. ARB. 627 (1993)
(Ex. CLA-0089), para. 113). See also History of the ICSID Convention, Documents Concerning the Origin and the
Formulation of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between Sates and Nationals of Other States,
Volume II-1 (Ex. CLA-0086), at p. 9 (“It is characteristic of arbitration that the parties are free in the choice of the
law to be applied by arbitrators. Example of such choice would be the national law of one of the parties, the principles
of law common to the legal systems of the two parties, general principles of law recognized by civilized nations,
principles of international law or any combination of the foregoing.”). Professor Schreuer likewise explains in his
commentary on the ICSID Convention that Article 42(1) “refers to ‘rules of law’ rather than to systems of law.
Therefore, it is generally accepted that the parties are not restricted to accepting an entire system of law tel quel but
are free to combine, to select and to exclude rules or sets of rules of different origin.” Christoph Schreuer et al.,

of law, including the carve-out of inconsistent provisions of Grenadian Law, must be given
full effect.247 The Claimants say that this approach has been applied consistently by ICSID
Tribunals. In Aucoven v. Venezuela, for example, the Tribunal noted that “[i]t is generally
accepted that...[the term ‘rules of law’ in Article 42(1)] allows the parties to agree on a
partial choice of law, and in particular to select specific rules from a system of law.”*48 A
common example of a partial choice of law (or exclusion of certain rules of national law)
is a “stabilization” clause that freezes national law at the time of the making of the
investment agreement so as to make any subsequent changes to that particular law

inapplicable to the investment.7?

215. In the Tribunal’s view, the Parties’ common intent regarding the choice of law is clear
and unambiguous and will be given effect. The Tribunal sits as an international tribunal
applying rules of international law. The rules include respect for party autonomy.
International law permits (and there is no evidence that the law of Grenada expressly
prohibits) giving effect to the parties’ choice of “rules of law” including a carve out of

such rules as the parties agree, including the rule against penalties.

216. Section 11.1 gives paramountcy to Section 7.9 and the Tribunal concludes that this

paramount intent must be given effect.

217. However, as will be seen, in the Tribunal’s view, the Repurchase provisions of Section 7.9
do not infringe any rule against penalties nor does Section 7.9 constitute an unconstitutional

fetter on the regulatory authority of the Government of Grenada. Accordingly, the legal

arguments advanced by the Respondent concerning the choice of law do not arise on the

facts of this case.

D. Does the Requirement of Second Schedule Compensation Fetter the Government
Action Contrary to the Constitution of Grenada?

218. The Respondent says the GOG cannot contractually grant an investor a special legal regime
subversive of the rules of the Constitution.” The intended effect of such a contractual

undertaking would be to negate the supremacy of the Constitution — a proposition that is

“an anathema” to the law in Grenada.”°!

219. On this point, the Respondent cites the authors of Dicey and Morris on the Conflict of Laws
(9" ed) who state that:

No court...will give effect to a choice of law...if the parties intended to
apply it in order to evade mandatory provisions of that legal system with

which the contract has its most substantial connection.”

253

220. The Respondent argues~” that the SPA imposes an “exorbitant” cost as the price for the

exercise of the Government’s otherwise lawful executive and legislative actions. Insofar
as it deters Government action in the public interest, Section 7.9(b) imposes

unconstitutional constraints on the Government’s freedom of action contrary to “the

principle of executive necessity”,”™ citing the 1921 observation of an English court:

250 Constitution of Grenada (Ex. RLA-0003), art. 106 (“This Constitution is the supreme law of Grenada and, subject
to the provisions of this Constitution, if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution, this Constitution shall
prevail and the other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.”); BCB Holdings (Ex. RLA-0031) para. 51
(Caribbean Court of Justice striking down contractual scheme which “conceptualised and designed a whole...tax
policy for the benefit of [a foreign investor]” on the basis that the contractual scheme had “the objective of overriding
all current and any future statutes enacted by the National Assembly” and the Constitution).

  

251 See e.g., BCB Holdings (Ex. RLA-0031), para. 59 (“[T]he supremacy of the Constitution is a core constitutional
value.”); Collymore v. AG (1967) 12 W.LR. 5 (CA TT) (Ex. RLA-0061)..
252 Respondent’s Opening Argument, Slide 52.
253 Counter-Memorial, para. 249.
254 The Respondent cites executive necessity as a principle of Caribbeanconstitutional law affirmed in the 1977 Revere
case by the Supreme Court of Jamaica:
Whatever doubts exist as to the precise limits of the principle, it is clear that, on the grounds of public policy,
[executive necessity] allows freedom of executive action in matters fundamental for effective government
and for the general welfare of the community...It is also clear on the authorities that when the principle

- 82 -

it is not competent for the Government to fetter its future executive action,
which must necessarily be determined by the needs of the community
when the question arises. It cannot by contract hamper its freedom of
action in matters which concern the welfare of the State.** (emphasis
added)

221. In the Tribunal’s view, the proposition that the Government cannot make a contract that
“hampers its freedom of action” where the “welfare of the State” is concerned is too broad.
Many traditional Government functions (i.e. aspects of health care for example) may be
outsourced. Outsourcing requires contractual commitments that “hamper” a Government’s
“freedom of action” and are not on that account invalid. The whole point of a contract is

to “hamper” the parties from engaging in conduct contrary to its terms.

222. According to the Respondent,”° the 2016 restructuring package is the “quintessential”
example of necessary Government action in the public interest, citing the Chief Justice of

Trinidad and Tobago’s opinion that:

[O]ne can readily envisage situations or areas of economic activity (e.g.
power or water supply, air traffic routes) where it may well be in the public
interest to restrict licences or concessions to one or two players...Equally,
one can also envisage that with changing circumstances it may be in the
public interest to liberalise or change a licencing or regulatory regime.?*”

223. The Respondent submits** that the 2016 restructuring was motivated by the urgent need

to reform the electricity sector to improve the economic position and general welfare of the

citizenry of Grenada.??

224. Similarly, in Revere Jamaica Alumina, the Jamaican Supreme Court held that the Jamaican
government’s contractual undertaking not to increase taxes and levies on certain mining

operations (i.e., a form of fiscal stabilization clause), was invalid because it fettered

Jamaica’s power to legislate (referred to as the “executive necessity” doctrine).

225. According to the Respondent, the “exorbitant” compensation contemplated by the Second
Schedule was intended by WRB to deter Government regulation of the electricity sector
in the public interest by making a repurchase prohibitively expensive and as such Second

Schedule compensation constitutes an unconstitutional fetter.?°!
226. The Claimants adopt the proposition of the sole arbitrator in Texaco:

[A] State cannot invoke its sovereignty to disregard commitments freely
undertaken through the exercise of this same sovereignty and cannot,
through measures belonging to its internal order, make null and void the
rights of the contracting party which has performed its various obligations
under the contract.”

In view of the implications for job creation, foreign direct investment, the overall development of the
economy of Grenada, and the international commitment[s] of the Government to the production of cleaner
and more renewable energy, it is imperative that relevant changes are made to pertinent legislation and
attendant regulations. The Government considers that the public interest must be viewed as overriding to the
interests of WRB/GRENLEC particularly given the essential nature of the service provided, the existing
monopoly, and the fact that the government occupies a minority position in GRENLEC and will thus be
unable to affect the direction taken by GRENLEC that may seriously affect this sector. Any response by
WRB in keeping with the provisions of Section 7.9 of the SPA will be very unfortunate. However, the
Government considers it unavoidable that necessary changes are promptly made to the framework in the
energy sector. (Ex. CE-0044, at p. 2; see also e.g. supra, paras. 134-135; Exs. RE-0074; RE-0038, at p. 59;

law, namely, that States cannot invoke domestic law to avoid their international obligations. Stephen Schwebel has
observed in this respect that “there is no more firmly established principle of international law than that a State cannot
plead its national law in derogation of its international obligations.” Stephen Schwebel, International Arbitration:

The Claimants contend that the Respondent is bound by the maxim pacta sunt servanda
because “international law...recognizes the power of a State to commit itself

internationally” even if its freedom of action is thereby “hampered.”

The Claimants point out that in fact the GOG was not deterred from precipitating
Repurchase Events. Otherwise this dispute would not have arisen and the Tribunal would
not be here. The Government was free to enact the 2016 ESA, and it did so with a plain
understanding of the repurchase price and Grenada must now bear “the consequences of
that action under the parties’ contract,” and “be ordered to honor its contract and bear all

costs of this arbitration.”

In the Tribunal’s view, the SPA properly construed is constitutionally compliant. The
SPA provides that “[n]o commitments made by the [Government of Grenada] in this
Agreement shall be construed in a manner that would constitute an infringement...of the
powers reserved under the Constitution of Grenada to any judicial or legislative body.”
If a provision can be construed in a way that is constitutionally compliant it must be so
construed. None of the provisions of the SPA properly construed “fetter” Government
action. Thirteen of the fifteen Repurchase Events in Section 7.9(a) specify actions which
the Government was free to take but which would give rise, at the Claimants’ election, to
a right under Section 7.9(b) to require the GOG to repurchase GPP’s shares.”°° Almost all
the Repurchase Events expressly contemplate the Government’s freedom of action to
modify or abrogate the rights and privileges of GRENLEC. There is no evidence that the
Government was deterred from legislating in the public interest. The 20-year debate
between the NDC party and the NNP party about privatization and repurchase rested on

public policy differences. The GOG was not deterred in 2016 by the prospect of paying

foreign investor.”). See also A.F.M. Maniruzzaman, State Contracts in Contemporary International Law: Monist

Second Schedule compensation as opposed to what it now proposes, namely Fair Market

Value.

230. The Respondent acknowledges that many of the Repurchase Events “closely mimic either
the substantive obligations typically imposed on host states by bilateral investment treaties,
or the express stabilisation obligations featured in numerous investment arbitration
cases.”°67 The Tribunal agrees and therefore cannot accept the Respondent’s constitutional

argument.

E. Does Second Schedule Compensation Constitute a Penalty?

231. The Respondent contends that Second Schedule compensation is extravagantly

disproportionate to the true value of the Claimants’ investment and constitutes a penalty.

232. Both Parties rely on the decision of the United Kingdom Supreme Court in Cavendish
which in 2015 considered anew the rule against penalties.°° Subsequent cases binding on
Grenadian courts confirm the application of Cavendish to contracts governed by Grenadian

law.26 Within Cavendish, however, the Parties emphasize different opinions:

(a) the Respondent relies in particular on the opinion of Lord Hodge that the key

consideration is whether there is “an extravagant disproportion between the

stipulated sum” to be paid, “and the highest level of damages that could possibly

arise from the breach”?” (the “extravagant disproportion” test);

the Claimants rely in particular on the lead opinion expressed by Lords Neuberger
and Sumption which frames the question somewhat differently. In the majority
view, disproportionate compensation only comes within the rule against penalties
if the clause or clauses in question arise in the context of “a secondary obligation”
— typically, a remedy in the form of payment of a sum of money — “which imposes
a detriment on the contract-breaker out of all proportion to any legitimate interest
of the innocent party in the enforcement of the primary obligation”?”! (the
“secondary obligation” test). On this view, a court or tribunal must consider at
the outset whether the Claimants seek enforcement such as specific performance of
the agreed purchase price (a “primary” obligation) or a remedy for breach of

contract agreement by a contract-breaker (a secondary obligation).

In their Memorial, the Claimants’ primary claim to relief is for specific performance (i.e.

payment of the repurchase price calculated according to the formula in the Second

Schedule). In the alternative, the Claimants ask for damages for non-performance.

The Respondent emphasizes that to find a penalty Cavendish does not require:

(a)

(b)

(c)

a finding that the Government had inadequate legal representation or specialist

advice;
a showing of uneven bargaining power;

that Claimants imposed the relevant provisions on the Government; or

consequence of a breach of contract is exorbitant or unconscionable when regard is had to the innocent party’s interest
in the performance of the contract”); see also ibid.

(d) a showing that the Government was ignorant of the details of the Second Schedule

methodology or its outcome.?””

235. The Respondent also calls in aid the earlier decision of the House of Lords in Dunlop

Tyre*”> which the Respondent says is still good law in Grenada, as held in decisions of the

Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court and Court of Appeal subsequent to Cavendish.?"* Under
the Dunlop Tyre line of authority, the Respondent argues, the clause will be deemed a
penalty when “a single lump sum is made payable by way of compensation, on the
occurrence of one or more or all of several events, some of which may occasion serious
and others trifling damages.”?’> That description, the Respondent says,” fits perfectly the
terms and effect of the present case,?”’ which requires the same “exorbitant” repurchase
price on the occurrence of any one of fifteen Repurchase Events of widely varying severity
from annulment of the licence or an act of God,?’* to “any [post-SPA] change in Grenadian
Law[...] [ however minor] which requires new capital expenditures or increased operating

costs by GRENLEC.”?”

236. Second, Dunlop Tyre is relied on by the Respondent for the proposition that “[t]he essence

of a penalty is a payment of money stipulated as in terrorem of the offending party.”?°°

The Respondent contends”*! that the threat of a Second Schedule buyout was always

intended to serve as a deterrent to Government regulation in the public interest.*”

The Claimants, for their part, say the Repurchase Event mechanism in Section 7.9 of the
SPA represents an agreed compromise. The Claimants expressed concern in 1994 about
the prospect the Government might unilaterally change the regulatory framework after the
privatization and thereby dramatically damage the value of the proposed investments.?*?
The Claimants wanted, in effect, a form of stabilization clause. The Government however
refused to accept a fetter on the exercise of its sovereign power to modify Grenada’s laws
and regulations,”** in the public interest. The compromise, the Claimants say, was to
ensure that the Government would not be “fettered” by any stabilization-type provision but
if certain events occurred, WRB would be able to demand that the Government repurchase
GPP’s shares and thus achieve WRB’s efficient exit from Grenada.”*° According to the
Claimants, “this resolution properly recognized and preserved the Government’s
prerogative to take any and all policy and legislative actions that it deemed appropriate.”?°°
The Respondent did not lead evidence to dispute the Government’s participation in crafting

this “compromise”.

The Claimants say the Second Schedule methodology protected their “legitimate interest”
—no more and no less — in accordance with Cavendish. They had a legitimate interest both
in maintaining their commercial bargain and “in an efficient exit, without the complexity
and expense associated with having to prove Claimants’ actual damage and without

controversy and delay, if these fundamentals [of the bargain] were to change.”?°7

282 Bx. RE-0012, paras. 10, 30(ii); Counter-Memorial, para. 209. The Respondent says that the outcome of the last
ICSID arbitration Claimants brought against the Government confirms that in terrorem is exactly how WRB and GPP
have used the threat of compelled repurchase in the past (Dunlop Tyre at p. 739). Less than three years after they had
purchased their stake in the Company for USD $5.6 million, the Claimants used the repurchase formula in the Second
Schedule to demand USD $18.7 million, more than triple the amount of their investment. The Government settled the
case instead of paying the Second Schedule compensation (See Ex. CE-0034).

As to the quantum, the repurchase price needed to properly reflect “not just the risks and
costs of the long-term investment involved, but also lost opportunity costs and lost profits
caused by their investment being cut short.”?*® The Government itself acknowledged that
the “Goodwill” component of the statutory methodology represented the “profit

opportunity foregone in [the] remaining term of the license.”?°°

In the result, the Claimants say, the Parties were free to and did negotiate “a practicable
exit protocol in the event of a change in the commercial fundamentals ... upon which the
investment was made...[including]...the exclusivity and duration of the GRENLEC

: 2
Licence.”

In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants had a legitimate interest in the protection of their
investment, as did the Respondent in protecting the public interest of the people of
Grenada. The issue raised by the Respondent is not whether the investment was entitled
to protection but whether Second Schedule “protection” was “out of all proportion” to the

Claimants’ legitimate interest as will now be addressed.

Does Application of the Second Schedule Result in an “Extravagantly
Disproportionate” Valuation?

John Ellison of FTI (and formerly of KPMG), the Claimants’ quantum expert,
acknowledged that “the valuation methodology set out in the 1994 ESA is different from
that normally used to value companies. Company valuations are largely based on future
earnings potential, often derived from future cash flow forecasts.””?! The Respondent’s
expert, Robert Mudge, testified that “[t]he Repurchase Price Methodology is
fundamentally out of step with standard valuation methodologies, duplicative, and hence

unlikely to be replicated by any third-party buyer.””°* Moreover, in the Respondent’ s view:

Part I of the Second Schedule sets out an asset valuation, which would normally
accompany a liquidation of the company.””? But, at the same time, Part II sets out
a profit valuation, which would normally pertain only to a going concern.?** These
inconsistent approaches, in combination, create double-accounting and therefore
inflated compensation in the result. For example, the Respondent contends that Mr.
Ellison double-counted EC $10 million (once as part of the assets under Part I and
a second time as profits under Part In;

the result of the Second Schedule formula (EC $21 per share)”*° is incompatible
with the EC $8.27 per share which the Claimants were willing to accept in
2012/2013, and which better reflects the true value of GRENLEC shares;

the result of the KPMG valuation using the Second Schedule is vastly in excess of
the DCF valuation of the Respondent’s expert, Mr. Mudge. The Claimants did not
put forward a DCF report and Mr. Mudge’s analysis is the only reliable guide to
Fair Market Value.

The Respondent relies on the formulation in Cavendish by Lord Mance at para. 143:

[T]he agreed sum must not have been extravagant, unconscionable or
incommensurate with the possible interest in maintenance of the system.”””

The Claimants’ principal position on the Second Schedule is that a deal is a deal and the

Respondent should live up to its contractual undertaking. Courts have no authority to

rewrite the terms of purchase. The Respondent cannot rebut the strong presumption that

“the parties themselves are the best judges of what is legitimate.”?°* In addition:

and (ii) a repurchase after one year. Under both scenarios, the valuation was within
the range of the valuations of GRENLEC that the Government had received from
its financial consultants, Price Waterhouse and Ewbank Preece, based on the

discounted cash flow model and the replacement value respectively; 299

the Second Schedule formula, while unusual, is of the Respondent’s own design.
It has been on the statute books in one form or another since 1960. The Government
itself dictated the Second Schedule approach to the Claimants. The GOG’s initial
objective was to establish the specific formula to calculate the repurchase payment
following a Government “call” for GRENLEC shares under section 28 of the 1994
ESA. The GOG then agreed with Claimants to use the same methodology in
conjunction with any “put” by the Claimants under Section 29 of the 1994 ESA;

the GOG was aware of the “Goodwill” component of the statutory methodology.

300

In a presentation to the public,*"” the Government explained that it represented the

“profit opportunity foregone in [the] remaining term of the license”;*”!

in December 2012 negotiations, the Government confirmed that it considered the
Repurchase Obligation to be reasonable by incorporating the Second Schedule
methodology into its proposed terms of the onward sale to a proposed Canadian

investor of the Claimants’ stake in GRENLEC once repurchased;*°

in any event, the Claimants argue, the Respondent’s attack rests on a false premise,
ie., that the Second Schedule yields a valuation of GRENLEC that is out of
proportion with the fair market value of the company.*°? The Claimants rely on its
expert, Mr. Ellison, who contended that when corrected for Mr. Mudge’s errors

and other required adjustments, the DCF valuation proffered by the Respondent

values for GRENLEC between EC $8.70 and EC $59.05 million. GRENLEC’s replacement value was estimated at

In any event, with the corrections and adjustments that you made and have netted out, the total value of
GRENLEC in your let’s call it corrected DCF valuation is just under EC $400 million; right?
A. Yes, subject to the caveat I mentioned that I’ve not done a full DCF, but that is just making certain
adjustments. That is showing the effect of the adjustments rather than showing my own figure.
Q. Okay. So, perhaps let’s just call it your adjusted DCF value.

A. Okay, as long as it’s understood what I’ ve done, but I think everyone in the room knows I’ve not done my
own DCF.
Q. Understood. So, that adjusted DCF value, the total value of GRENLEC, hundred percent of the Shares
just under EC $400 million?
A. Yes, that’s right.
Q. Okay. And they’re 19 million shares, so that works out about EC $21 per share.
A. Yes. As I said, I have not done my calculations per share, but I’m sure you’re right.
Q. Okay. In any event, your nearly EC $400 million in the adjusted DCF valuation is more than your Second
Schedule valuation of EC $364.3 million?
A. Well, that’s correct, but I should just to be fair make the point that since then, life has moved on a bit, and
we've had Mr. Mudge’s further report which I was not permitted to do a Reply because we're up to round
four ready, and he has raised some other issues which might alter that figure.

EC $17 million (not USD $17 million) for 100% of GRENLEC. WRB ultimately invested EC $19 million for 50%

247. Indeed, it seems WRB would have taken EC $7.50 per share.3!5

248. In other words, the Respondent relies on the fact that in 2013 the Claimants were willing
to sell their shares for less than half of what they now demand. The Government declined
to pay the asking price and WRB pulled out of the negotiations.*!® There is no evidence
that GRENLEC shares greatly appreciated in value between 2013 and 2016.

249. The Claimants deny the relevance of their 2013 offer to sell their GRENLEC holding at

EC $8.27 per share.*!7 The 2013 offer was subject to several conditions that had value for
the Claimants, e.g., a requirement that GRENLEC would continue using WRB’s
management services.*!* In addition, Mr. Blanchard explains that the origin of the offer
was that two individual investors [Roseman and Curtis] were facing “personal challenges”

at the time, and they sought to “unwind their equity positions.”*!? The Claimants did not

Q. You were prepared to take 750.
A. We were prepared to move forward, yes.

Q. But when you say “move forward,” you were prepared to take 750?
A. Yes, yes, yes. Again, primarily motivated by the pressures that the Curtises and Rosemans had asked us
to deal with.

[T]his was a few years after the great recession, and Florida real estate was still under tremendous challenges,
and [Roseman and Curtis] had projects which they had significant challenges on and financial challenges on,
and they wanted -- they felt like they could -- this was an investment that if they could liquidate it would help
those challenges.

Q. And you said, then, that WRB was prepared to accept a much lower price for its shares in GRENLEC in
2012 and 2013 because of that pressure?
A. That's correct.

Q. And you didn’t think it was necessary to even crosscheck the Second Schedule value in this case?
A. Well, no, because it’s a very specific, easy to follow formula. I mean, I think one of the reasons it was set
out that way, and I’m speculating slightly here, is that it avoids a lot of uncertainty about what’s going to
happen in the future because there’s no reference to the future. There is a very clear black and white formula
which does not permit any other methods such as DCF or multiples or historical costs or anything. I would
agree with you that, if you’re normally doing a valuation and as I've said this is an unusual one, you would
look to triangulate it by looking at other measures. So, if you’re doing a DCF one, you would probably look
at multiples and the prices at which quoted shares in similar companies are operating. So, normally, yes, one
would triangulate it but this is different here because, you know, you've got these railway lines telling you
exactly what to do in the ESA.

obtain an independent valuation of GRENLEC*” before suggesting a price of EC $8.27
per share. Accordingly, the Claimants say, “the 2013 offer says nothing at all about the
‘actual value’ of GRENLEC at the time much less its value in 2019.”27!

The Respondent says courts have refused to enforce clauses which award sums equivalent
to double or triple the prevailing market price or the claimant’s genuine estimated loss.*”?
Accordingly, “extravagant disproportion” is established in this case. The Tribunal agrees
with the Respondent that the value of GRENLEC assessed under the Second Schedule is
very substantially in excess of the EC $8.27 per share which the Claimants were willing to
accept in 2012. However, the Claimants are not “estopped” by the $8.27 figure which the
Respondent declined to accept. In the absence of an estoppel, the Tribunal must be guided

by the expert witnesses.

It does appear that the Second Schedule compensation is substantially in excess of a DCF
valuation. However, the pertinent question is whether the “extravagantly disproportionate”
test applies at all to this case, bearing in mind the dictum of Lords Neuberger and Sumption
in Cavendish that the rule against enforcement of penalties provides no basis for the courts
to review primary obligations, i.e. “the courts do not review the fairness of men’s bargains
either at law or in equity.”*** On this view, the Respondent agreed to the Second Schedule
and in the absence of unconscionability or a gross imbalance in bargaining power (which

is not alleged), the question is whether the GOG should be relieved of a bargain which it

now views as unsatisfactory but is a “primary bargain” which it made with the benefit of

sound professional advice and its eyes wide open.

H. Are the Claimants Seeking to Enforce a “Primary” or “Secondary” Obligation?

252. The Claimants argue that under Cavendish the rule against penalties has no application to
the Repurchase Obligation as the Repurchase Obligation is a primary conditional
obligation (a put option) and not a secondary obligation (a remedy for a contractual
breach).*** The UK Supreme Court in Cavendish emphasized “[t]here is a fundamental
difference between a jurisdiction to review the fairness of a contractual obligation and a
jurisdiction to regulate the remedy for its breach”, as stated by Lords Neuberger and

Sumpton:

Leaving aside challenges going to the reality of consent, such as those
based on fraud, duress or undue influence, the courts do not review the
fairness of men’s bargains either at law or in equity. The penalty rule
regulates only the remedies available for breach of a party’s primary
obligations, not the primary obligations themselves.** (emphasis added)

Section 7.9 of the SPA enables a shareholder to exit its investment at a certain price “upon
the occurrence” of one or more of the fifteen events listed in Section 7.9(a).*?° Payment of

the agreed repurchase price is a primary obligation.

324 Reply Memorial, para. 153.

35 Cavendish (Ex. RLA-0039), para. 13 (emphasis added). See also Vivienne Westwood Ltd. v. Conduit Street
Development Ltd. [2017] EWHC 350 (Ch) (Ex. RLA-0064), para. 41 (“The Cavendish case shows clearly that,
in considering whether a contractual stipulation is or is not a penalty, one must address first the threshold issue — is
the stipulation in substance a secondary obligation engaged upon breach of a primary contractual obligation; then
identify the extent and nature of the legitimate interest of the promisee in having the primary obligation performed,
and then determine whether or not, having regard to that legitimate interest, the secondary obligation is exorbitant or
unconscionable in amount or in its effect.”); Holyoake v. Candy [2017] EWHC 3397 (Ex. CLA- 0130), para. 467. The
Supreme Court explained in Cavendish that, “if the contract does not impose (expressly or impliedly) an obligation to
perform the act, but simply provides that, if one party does not perform, he will pay the other party a specified sum,
the obligation to pay the specified sum is a conditional primary obligation and cannot be a penalty.” Cavendish (Ex.

shall be calculated{.]”).

253. The Respondent concedes that under the applicable case law, only provisions that create

contractual remedies can be deemed penalties*’ but in the Respondent’s view, the

Claimants’ “put option” is just another kind of tailored remedy provision. The test is a

question of “substance” and not of “form.”*?® The fact that Section 7.9(b) is formulated as
a “put option” rather than a liquidated damages clause or similar term, is irrelevant in the
Respondent’s view. *”° The rule against penalties applies to the full range of contractual

remedies, including obligations to transfer assets at an agreed price.**°

254. The Claimants insist that the Respondent’s “substance over form” argument is not only at
odds with the majority opinion in Cavendish,>*' but it is at odds with the concurring opinion
of Lord Hodge, on which the Respondent particularly relies. Lord Hodge related his

“extravagant disproportion” dictum to clauses “fixing the level of damages [for a] breach”

(e.g. a liquidated damages clause The Claimants emphasize that their claim for

repurchase payment is not for payment of damages for contract breach, but specific

performance of a contractual bargain.

255. In the Tribunal’s view, the rule against penalties has no application to the present
case. The Respondent cannot be said to be a “contract breaker’. It has argued that it is
relieved from performance by virtue of various legal arguments including the “wilful

malfeasance” provision. If required to pay compensation, the Respondent has argued that

a specified sum of money, the obligation to pay the specified sum is a secondary obligation” — in other words, a
contractual remedy — “which is capable of being a penalty”).

key service agreement). See Ex. RE-0086.

its obligation would be fulfilled by payment of fair market value. The fact the Tribunal has
not agreed with these positions does not turn the Respondent’s contested questions of

interpretation into breaches of the SPA.

In the 1994 SPA, the GOG made a conditional offer to purchase the GRENLEC shares in
the event one or more “repurchase” events occurred. In the first instance, at least, it is for
the Claimants to formulate the relief they seek. The primary relief sought by the Claimants
is specific performance of the GOG promise to purchase. The Claimants seek to enforce
the contract not a remedy for its breach. The rule against penalties presupposes a breach
of the contract and a claim for damages, per Lord Hodge in Cavendish, at para. 243:

The rule against penalties is a rule of contract law based on public policy.

It is a question of construction of the parties’ contract judged by reference

to the circumstances at the time of contracting; the public policy is that the

courts will not enforce a stipulation for punishment for breach of
contract.>*

and Lords Neuberger and Sumption at para. 28:

The true test is whether the impugned provision is a secondary obligation
which imposes a detriment on the contract-breaker out of all proportion
to any legitimate interest of the innocent party in the enforcement of the
primary obligation.**+

The Respondent argues that the fact the SPA specifies the same compensation for several
Repurchase Events shows it is a penalty rather than a genuine pre-estimate of damages.
However, in the Tribunal’s view, the range of Repurchase events shows that the
Repurchase Obligation has nothing to do with fixing the level of damages. Rather, the
SPA determines the purchase price of the GRENLEC shares. Because any Repurchase
Event triggers the transfer of the same assets (the GRENLEC shares), the valuation of the
GRENLEC shares will always be the same regardless of the seriousness of the event that

triggered the repurchase.

- 99 -

In the Tribunal’s view, the GOG cannot convert its primary obligation to repurchase the
GRENLEC shares at an agreed price into a secondary obligation to pay damages. The
Claimants have framed this case as a claim in specific performance of the SPA. If an
individual of sound mind buys a painting and agrees to pay twice what it is worth despite
the availability of expert advice and is not disadvantaged by duress, or some debilitating
infirmity, or uneven bargaining power, Cavendish holds that a court or tribunal has no
authority to set aside the bargain because the purchaser now claims he agreed to pay an

“extravagantly disproportionate” price.

The Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent’s challenge to the validity and applicability
of the Second Schedule as determining the Repurchase Price of the Claimants’ GRENLEC

shares.

QUANTUM

Section 7.9(b) of the SPA specifies that “the GOG agrees that it shall...upon the occurrence
of a Repurchase Event, purchase and acquire all GRENLEC shares then owned by the
Buyer” (i.e. GPP). The Claimants’ quantum expert, John Ellison of FTI, assessed the
Second Schedule value of the Claimants’ investment (and thus the claim) as of the
valuation date, | August 2016, being 50% of GRENLEC’s value, for a claim of EC $182.04
million**>, subsequently adjusted to EC $182.1 million**° At the hearing, Mr. Ellison

accepted a further adjustment resulting in a revised value of EC $180.941 million. PwC
produced a Second Schedule valuation of GRENLEC at approximately EC $299.4
million?’ of which the Claimants’ 50% share would be EC $149.7 million. At the hearing,
PwC revised that figure to EC $276.239 million (of which 50% is EC $138.12 million),

approximately 24% less than FTT’s revised valuation.

The Tribunal was presented with conflicting calculations of Second Schedule
compensation by PwC, called by the Respondent and Mr. Ellison (FTI) and Mr. Popovic
(KPMG) for the Claimants.**

In addition, the Tribunal also heard evidence from Mr. Robert Mudge of the Brattle Group,
retained by the Respondent. Applying a version of the discounted cash flow (DCF)
approach, Mr. Mudge generated values much lower than the quantum experts who applied

the Second Schedule:

A. I think they are fair estimates of the Fair Market Value of GRENLEC.
Q. You have not applied the agreed methodology to determine the price of GRENLEC: right?
A. I’ve calculated the value based on a standard methodology, not bound by the Second Schedule, that’s
correct.
Q. You have not applied the repurchase-price methodology; right?
A. Correct.
Q. ...[PwC considered] GRENLEC, the value [to be] between EC $22.28 million and EC $38.37 million is

264. The Second Schedule is comprised of three parts:
(a) Part I sets out a methodology for calculating the value of GRENLEC’s net assets;*“!
(b) Part II sets out a methodology for calculating GRENLEC’s goodwill; and

(c) Part III sets out certain depreciation rates to be used in calculations under Part I and

Part 11.343

*! Part I of the Second Schedule stipulates that the value of GRENLEC’s net assets should be calculated at the
Repurchase Event Date as:

(a) the value in the open market of the Company’s assets (other than goodwill and fixed asset:

 

 

(b) the value in the open market of all land of whatever tenure of the Company as if such land were
unencumbered with any such buildings, plant, works and fixtures as may be erected thereon or affixed
thereto; and
(c) the replacement cost on site of the Company’s fixed assets (excluding land but including any such
buildings, plant, works and fixtures as may be erected on or affixed to such land and including also the fixed
assets described in Part III of this Schedule)
after deducting from such aggregate amount, firstly, depreciation calculated on the replacement cost
(including customs and import duties) of each such fixed asset (such depreciation to be reckoned in the case
of each such fixed asset from the date when the fixed asset in question was acquired by the Company to the
date of the revocation of the Licence at the appropriate rate specified in Part III, or, in the case of any fixed
asset not described in Part III, at a reasonable rate, provided that in respect of any fixed asset which is not
reasonably suitable for its purpose by reason of absolescence [sic], lack of repair or other cause the amount
of depreciation to be deducted shall equal the difference between the replacement cost of the asset in question
and its value in the open market) and, secondly, the amount of the Company’s debts and other liabilities
arising otherwise than in respect of any debentures or preference shares issued by the Company.
(Ex. CE-0005, pp. 173-174)

+2 The methodology for calculating the value of GRENLEC’s goodwill under the ESA Valuation Methodology at the

Repurchase Event Date is as follows:

 

 

The value of the Company's goodwill shall be deemed for the purpose of section 29 to equal the aggregate
of the Company’s net trading profits (as certified by the Company’s auditors) during the five completed
financial years of the Company next preceding the revocation of the Licence (such net trading profits being
computed before charging or crediting income tax or similar tax based on income and before making any
loan redemption provision or other appropriation of profits but after making all other deductions including
payment of interest on indebtedness and provisions for depreciation at the appropriate rates specified in
Part III of this Schedule) after deducting from the aggregate amount of such profits the aggregate amount
of all customs and import duties (excluding customs and import duties on fuel) which the Company would,
but for the provision of section 13, have had to pay during the aforementioned five completed financial
years of the Company... (emphasis added). (Ex. CE-0005, p. 174)

The relevant financial years are ended 31 December 2011 to 2015 (ie. the past five completed financial years

prior to the Repurchase Date of 1 August 2016).

A. The Respondent Says it was Prevented from Doing a Second Schedule Calculation by
the Claimants’ Refusal of Cooperation

266. The Respondent argues that GRENLEC is the sole custodian of a significant amount of
relevant information which GRENLEC refused to disclose to the Respondent’s experts.*45

Thus, the Respondent’s experts have been forced to rely on the limited information

provided by the Claimants and publicly available data in its review of FTI’s Second

Schedule valuation.

267. In the course of the hearing, two of the Respondent’s quantum experts complained of denial
of access to relevant information, including a frustrating site visit by Doran McClellan in
January 2019 where, he says, GRENLEC employees were instructed by the Claimants’

counsel not to answer straight-forward factual questions.

268. Mr. McClellan testified that:

 

I would tell you that that site visit, after 45 years of site visits in the
valuation of machinery and equipment, is the most restrictive site visit that
I have ever been a part of .°

269. The Claimants’ expert, Mr. Thomas Popovic, a consultant on valuation who also attended
the site visit in January 2019, said it appeared to comply with his understanding of the prior

agreement reached between counsel for both Parties.*4”

6 Transcript, Day 4, p. 1334, Il. 14-17.
7 Popovic Second Reply Report (“Popovic I”), dated 24 May 2019 at pp. 8-9. Mr. Popovic reported as follow:

 

PwC acknowledges that during the Site Visit, it was permitted to ask certain questions of GRENLEC
personnel, as listed at paragraph 4.1.3 of PwC’s report, as well as follow up questions to confirm and clarify
points. PwC states that it was prohibited from discussing other questions with GRENLEC personnel.

 

 

Int pect, it was my understanding that, in advance of the Site Visit, the Government had proposed, and
Claimants had agreed, that PwC would be permitted to ask the following questions of GRENLEC personnel:

e¢ How are the major electric power generation assets used?

© What are their current conditions?

e — What is the layout of the transmission grid and related sub-stations?

e = What are the primary distribution areas and where are they located?

© — What is the location of the other main transmission and distribution assets?

e What are the measurements, the principal characteristics, and the uses of these buildings? [See Email from

Debevoise & Plimpton to White & Case dated 24 December 2018 (Ex. CE-0216); Email from White & Case
to Debevoise & Plimpton dated 4 January 2019 (Ex. CE-0218)].
During my participation in the Site Visit, the GOG’s representatives and experts were afforded the
opportunity to ask GRENLEC personnel these questions as well as follow-up questions to confirm and clarify
the answers provided on these points. Objections were raised only when GOG’s representatives and experts
asked GRENLEC personnel questions that were outside the scope of the agreed list, or when PwC made
requests for new documents.

270. Mr. McClellan said he assessed building construction costs in Grenada as the same as in

the United States because he says he lacked local information to do otherwise.***

271. As to whether the Tribunal could safely rely on his asset valuation, Mr. McClellan

responded to a question from a Tribunal member as follows:

ARBITRATOR ADEKOYA: Mr. McClellan, I have just one question. In
Paragraph 4.2.1 of your Report, you have indicated the restrictive nature
of the site visits, the lack of access to supporting materials and to
information.

THE WITNESS: Correct.

ARBITRATOR ADEKOYA: To what extent would you say that this
impacts negatively on the figures that you have quoted in your Report?
THE WITNESS: Well, it’s hard for me to assess what the negative impact
would be...

Hk a ak a

And I would really like to address your point and say, well, it might have
a 10 percent negative impact, but I don’t know because we never, even
were able to make any assessments whatsoever in that regard.

#8 Mr. McClellan testified as follows:
Q. Now, when you were in Grenada, did you speak with a local developer?
A. We reached out to local developers, but we received no responses and no return calls.
Q. And Mr. Brewer did not prevent you from speaking with local developers; right?
A. Well, that was procedures we implemented once we returned to the office to try and find any local
construction people in Grenada.
Q. Now, is that because there are few developers in Grenada; right?
A. You know, we reached out to whoever we could. I don’t remember who the Parties were. There were
never any responses.
Q. Now, you applied — instead of applying the rates obtained from a local developer, you provided rates
from the cost estimating guide; right?
A. Well, we didn't have rates from a local develop so we use the U.S. publication, MVS Services, as it
relates to certain types of buildings, industrial buildings or whatever.
Q. And MVS is Marshall Valuation Services; right?
A. That's correct.

RRR ER

Now, the reason we didn't make any adjustments is because we had — we had such a lack of data and
information, including footings, foundations, and piers that might have been below the buildings, as well as
any other information that we did not — and under my instruction — we did not want to create a whole list of
extraordinary assumptions that weren't known and knowable into which we couldn't offer exact
specifications. So we used the straight cost of the MVS Manual.
Q. Well —
A. The U.S. cost.

ARBITRATOR ADEKOYA: If you were my advisor and I’m trying to
make an acquisition, based on this Report, what would you tell me?

THE WITNESS: I would tell you that we need to do a thorough
investigation of the assets and the asset records, the amounts recorded in
the asset records, how the--what has been the capitalization policy into the
asset record, what adjustments have you made over the years.*

It would appear therefore that Mr. McClellan would not regard his valuation of assets under
Part I of the Schedule as reliable without “‘a thorough investigation” of a type which he was

unable to perform at GRENLEC.

The Tribunal accepts that the Respondent’s experts were denied some of the factual
information they considered important, but in that case it was up to the Respondent to

invoke the Tribunal’s assistance to seek additional disclosure.

By its ruling dated 17 September 2018, the Tribunal ordered disclosure of much financial
and other information from GRENLEC. Certainly the Tribunal expected the Respondent
to be in a position to make a full answer and defence to the claims. If subsequent
difficulties arose (as described by Mr. McLellan in connection with the site visit), the
Tribunal stood ready to deal with disputes arising out of any protocol negotiated by the
Parties. The Tribunal was not approached by either Party for a further disclosure Order or
other interim measure in this respect. In light of Mr. McLellan’s own self-deprecating
assessment of the value of his report, the Tribunal concludes that his report is of little

assistance to the resolution of the claim.

(wD The Meaning of “Net Trading Profits As Certified by the Company Auditors”
During the Five Completed Financial Years [Prior to the Repurchase Event]

The phrase “net trading profits” is not a defined term in the Second Schedule but none of

the experts expressed difficulties applying the term.

The Respondent’s expert, Wilfred Baghaloo, testified the phrase simply means “net profits

of the company.”*>°

277. The significance of the expression “as certified by the auditors” is less clear. The purpose

seems to have been to freeze the accounts as set out in the financial statements of the
preceding five years so as to create a firm basis for valuation that could not be manipulated

after the initiation of the claim.*>!

278. However, in some instances, both FTI and PwC departed from the audited accounts for the

279.

280.

years 2011 through 2015. As will be explained, the result of such departures would be, in

the Tribunal’s view, to skew the valuation intended by the Parties.

The Competing Valuations

In the result, after the adjustments accepted at the hearing, FTI appraised GRENLEC at EC
$361,882,000 and the Claimants’ entitlement, at EC $180.941 million equating to USD
$67 million .

PwC valued GRENLEC at EC $276.239 million, of which the Claimants’ entitlement
would be EC $138.12 million or USD $51.155 million.

Q. So, if the Net Trading Profits do not appear in the Financial Statements, sir — and you can take my
representation for that -GRENLEC’s auditors do not certify the Net Trading Profits of GRENLEC; right?
A. Well, that’s really — you’re getting into a legal issue here, a bit of substance over form. From an accounting
perspective, where the word “net trading profit” and, you know, different persons, some person may call it
“net trading profit,” some call it “net profits.” I think it meant overall the Net Profits of the Company, I guess
the word “trading” used to exist because trading was, you know, back in the days, but I think substance or
form, it means — it has a meaning, which is the net profits of the Company.

Q. Well, but you seem to be hesitating a lot, though, in coming to that conclusion; right?

A. Yes, because — because the words, you know — it’s lower case it says “net trading profits,” low N, low T,
low P, you know, I think it’s substance over form or substantial what they really mean.

Q. They’re somewhat unusual, those words; right?

A. No, I don’t think so.

351 Mr. Ellison testified as follows:

 

ARBITRATOR BOULTON: And t a question that’s probably ultimately for counsel rather than for you,
but in your experience, is it right that sometimes agreements have in a phrase like “go to the Audited Accounts
to get this figure,” and that a reason for that is to provide certainty, that the Parties know what accounts
they're going to find the figures in order to adopt something like Schedule 2 rather than opening up a dispute
about whether a different accounting treatment should have been possible or preferable.

THE WITNESS: Yes. That is right, but whether that extends as far as s
whether an accounting treatment is possible or preferable but simply a m
but that's a matter for you.

mething which is not a question of
stake, that’s pushing it a bit further,

281. The principal issues on which the quantum experts differed are as follows:

@

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

(vi)

deferred taxes (EC $37.8 million) — PwC considers that GRENLEC has a deferred
tax liability because of the restated value of fixed assets arising from the repurchase.
FTI states that no such restatement or revaluation is necessary or appropriate as a

result of a transaction between shareholders;

Hurricane Insurance Reserve Fund (EC $10 million) — is treated by PwC as a

liability but by FTI as an “equity reserve” i.e. an appropriation of profit;

computer depreciation (EC $7.3 million) — PwC and Robert Mudge depreciated the
GRENLEC computers at a 20% rate given the useful life of computer technology
(estimated at 5 years), whereas FTI classifies computers as “furniture and office
equipment” within the meaning of Part III of the 1994 Second Schedule, which

calls for a depreciation rate of 5%?

customer contribution to the cost of installing supply lines to the private premises
distant by 400 feet or more (EC $4.6 million) — at issue is whether and to what
extent these payments are refundable and therefore should be recognized as a
liability.°°? PwC recognizes a liability of EC $7 million. FTI recognizes only a

lesser liability of EC $2.4 million, on the basis that the balance is non-refundable;

FTI has inflated the valuation of assets by adding in an amount equivalent to
“customs and import duties” that were never paid because of GRENLEC’s then

existing tax exemption (EC $754 thousand);

the Respondent says the Claimants’ experts wrongly included in the valuation some

of “the assets that were damaged or destroyed” by Hurricane Ivan (EC $22.486

included assets which no longer exist and form no part of the GRENLEC enterprise.

(viii) Other (EC $380 thousand).

Impact on the Valuation of the Disputed Items

FTI sought to show the relative importance of these differences as follows:

(deferred tax) and EC $0.5 million (customs duties) made by PwC at the hearing.

Alleged Liability for Deferred Taxes (EC $37.852 Million)

PwC considers that GRENLEC has a deferred tax liability because of a restated value of
fixed assets that PwC says would result from the repurchase. FTI states that there is no
such revaluation. The repurchase is a transaction between shareholders. GRENLEC’s

financial statements are not affected.

The Respondent’s quantum expert, Mr. Wilfred Baghaloo of PwC acknowledged that at
present, there is no such deferred tax liability and that such a tax liability would not arise
unless and until GRENLEC “restate upwards” the carrying value of its fixed assets, which
GRENLEC has not done and which Mr. Baghaloo admits GRENLEC is not under any

present obligation to do so.*°°

In the Tribunal’s view, there is no factual foundation for the alleged “deferred tax
liability” which does not exist and which therefore need not be taken into account in the

valuation of GRENLEC as of the valuation date of 1 August 2016.

Hurricane Insurance Reserve Fund (EC $10 Million)

In each of the relevant financial years, GRENLEC put aside EC $2 million as a form of

self-insurance against hurricane damage. In the financial statements 2011 to 2015, the fund

was recorded as a liability.*°”

356 Mr. Baghaloo testified as follows:
Q. Now, for this to happen, for GRENLEC to have to account for deferred tax liability in its accounts,
GRENLEC would have to revalue its fixed assets; right?
A. That’s correct.
Q. That is, GRENLEC would have to restate upwards the carrying value of its fixed assets.
A. That's correct.
Q. In its books.
A. That’s correct.
Q. And GRENLEC has not done so.
A. No, it has not.
Q. Is there any indication in the record, sir, that GRENLEC intends to do so?
A. Not to the best of my knowledge.

Q. In fact, sir, isn't it true that GRENLEC is under no obligation to restate the carrying value of its fixed
assets, whether to reflect the Second Schedule valuation under the ESA or for any other reasons?

A. That is correct. But equally, it can account for it, if it so chose to do.
Q. If it so chose to; right?
A. At this point in time.
Q. Right.
Transcript, 21 June 2019, p. 1488, 1. 18 to p. 1489, 1. 19. (emphasis added)
357 Mr. Ellison testified:
Q. Okay. So the accounting treatment of the Hurricane Insurance Reserve Fund as of the Valuation Date was
as a liability; right?
A. Yes, that’s right.

287. The 2016 financial statements correcting the “error” were only issued on 17 March 2017
which was subsequent to the commencement of this arbitration and subsequent to the

Valuation Date of 1 August 2016.78

288. In their respective quantum reports, the “Hurricane Reserve Fund” is treated by PwC as a

liability but by FTI as an “equity reserve”, i.e. an appropriation of profit.

289. The Claimants argue that the earlier classification by the GRENLEC auditors**® as a
liability was an error subsequently acknowledged by GRENLEC’s auditors (PKF) and by
the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (“ACCA”).* (The Respondent

contends that KPMG initiated the “correction”.)*°!

358 John Ellison testified:

Q. And GRENLEC partially changed that treatment as you just referred to, in the 2016 Annual Report?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, as with many annual reports it comes out the year after, so the 2016 Annual Report was dated March

2017; right?

A. Yes.

Q. That's about the time that your First Report, your indicative Valuation Report was finalized; right?

A. Yes, I think that was March’17.

Q. Okay. March’17 is after the Valuation Date of August Ist, 2016; right?

A. Yes.
Transcript, 19 June 2019, p. 907, Il. 11-22.

And the issue, sir, that you will have to decide is whether you follow PriceWaterhouse’s approach which is

basically, as I understand it, to treat contributions to the fund as expenses because that is what the accounts

showed at the time, and then you’ve got this reference to as certified by the Company's auditors, or whether

to take the correct approach and accept that this is not a liability, and putting aside this 2 million every year

is not an expense, it is a reserve.
Transcript, 19 June 2019, p. 797, 1. 22 to p. 798, 1. 9.
35° “Prior to GRENLEC’s 2016 Audited Accounts, the annual EC $2 million contribution to the Hurricane Insurance
Reserve fund was recorded as an expense in GRENLEC’s accounts, with the other side of the accounting entry being
an addition to the ‘Provision for Hurricane Insurance Reserve’, which was recorded as a liability in those
accounts... The 2015 Audited Accounts record this amount to be EC $19.953 million...GRENLEC changed its
accounting treatment of the Hurricane Insurance Reserve in the 2016 Audited Accounts, and restated the 2015
comparative results to reflect this change of treatment. GRENLEC now reflects the Hurricane Insurance Reserve
under Shareholder’s Equity as a reserve, and not as a ‘provision’ in Liabilities... However, GRENLEC still deducts
deposits into the Hurricane Insurance Reserve in the calculation of its profits before tax (ie. GRENLEC still
treats these deposits as an expense), even though they should now be considered an appropriation of profits to
the Hurricane Insurance Reserve rather than an expense. (emphasis added) (Ellison & Popovic, pp. 86-87)

In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent is correct. Part II of the Second Schedule directs
the valuation to be based on the financial statements for the 5 years preceding the
revocation of the license, being 1 August 2016, “‘as certified by the Company auditors”.
Throughout those years, the financial statements were “certified by the auditors.” The
Tribunal accepts the evidence that GRENLEC’s auditors were probably wrong in their
treatment of the “hurricane reserve” over the relevant 5 years but for the purpose of the
Second Schedule calculation, the auditor’s certification is conclusive. The Tribunal

therefore concludes that the Hurricane Insurance Reserve must be treated as a liability.

Computer Depreciation (EC $7.3 Million)

GRENLEC has substantial computer systems. The company had some computer capacity
in 1994, but in the subsequent 22 years technology accelerated and more sophisticated

systems were acquired.

It is not clear what rate of depreciation was applied by GRENLEC’s auditors to the

computer systems in the 2011 to 2015 period.

PwC and Robert Mudge depreciated the GRENLEC computers at a 20% rate given their
estimate of a 5-year useful life of computer technology. The Claimants’ expert, Mr.
Popovic, classified computers as “furniture and office equipment” within the meaning of
Part III of the 1994 Second Schedule, which meant applying a depreciation rate of 5%*°

implying a useful life of 20 years.

The Second Schedule expressly states that any asset “not described in [the] Part IIT”
categories must be depreciated “at a reasonable rate”*** [the reasonable rate test]. The
Tribunal is satisfied that a reasonable rate would have reflected the much shorter useful life
of computers. The Respondent accuses FTI of choosing a rate that would artificially inflate

the value ascribed to Claimants’ shares.*°*

295. Mr. Popovic testified that he would have felt free under the Second Schedule to use a

different rate of depreciation if the application of a 5% rate to computers “would have

99365

yielded an unreasonable result. However, in his view, the 5% rate was not

unreasonable.*°

296. The Respondent points out that the depreciation rates set out in Part III of the Second
Schedule were prepared in 1960 when computers were not a significant factor in the
GRENLEC business. It is anomalous that “bicycles” and “motor launches” have their own
category but not the much larger asset class of computers. It is obvious that, in the 2011—

2015 period, computer technology did not have a useful life of 20 years.

297. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that a 5% depreciation rate for computers is

unreasonable.

298. The Claimants’ expert, Mr. Popovic, testified that he applied a “reasonableness” test to

depreciation rates and did not apply without question the 5% rate to computers as being

465 Mr. Popovic testified as follows:

Q...there’s a provision, let’s call it the “common sense” clause, which says that if the asset doesn’t fit into one of
those categories, you can apply a reasonable rate?
A. That’s — that’s correct.
Q. Okay. So, would you agree with me that if an asset under one view perhaps used to belong in one category,
but times have changed, technology has advanced, so that it no longer fit that category, the “common sense”
clause allows you to determine what would be the appropriate depreciation rate?
A. I think if it would have yielded an unreasonable result, then I would consider making a change to
something that was reasonable. In this case, it didn’t yield an unreasonable result, so didn’ t feel it was necessary
to make a change.

Transcript, 20 June 2019, p. 1055, I. 8 to p. 1056, 1. 1.

36 Mr. Popovic explains that:
I disagree with PwC’s approach for two reasons. First, computers were widely used in offices in 1994. Yet in
the Second Schedule the parties chose not to create a distinct category for computers. They chose only the broader
category of office equipment. I note that where the parties wanted to create specific (rather than broad) categories
in Part III of the Second Schedule, they did so (for example, “bicycles” and “motor launches”).
Second, in my experience, the purpose of provisions such as the one that PwC relied upon to justify creating a
new asset category (“in the case of any fixed asset not described in Part III”) is to allow for the acquisition of new
technology, not for the re-classification of existing technology. For example, solar panels and batteries are assets
that were not owned by GRENLEC in 1994 (and were not specified in Part III of the Second Schedule) but were
owned by GRENLEC as of the Valuation Date, and so I assigned them to a new asset classification. In contrast,
I understand that computers were owned and used by GRENLEC in 1994.

“furniture and office equipment, on the basis that while computer technology

progresses rapidly much of the computer infrastructure has an extended useful life.
299. Mr. Ellison acknowledged the Second Schedule left room for judgment:

THE WITNESS: Well, you could take — you could take a view on that,
Mr. President. I took the view, as did Mr. Popovic, that it is office
equipment and, therefore, one goes by the rates that in their wisdom those
who drafted the Schedule came up, but I can see that you could say, well,
it’s actually not office equipment, it’s in a category of its own. People did
have computers back in 1994, so it’s not something that — I had one then.
It's not something that had only come along since.**

300. The Tribunal agrees with PwC that technology has changed in the years since 1994, let
alone 1960, when the depreciation categories were fixed. There is no evidence that
GRENLEC possessed any computers in 1960 GRENLEC when the GOG adopted the

depreciation rates for office equipment.

301. The Tribunal does not consider the fact that some sort of computers were present in 1994
(there is evidence computers were present but no details of what they were or did) requires

their inclusion in “furniture and office equipment” when it was obvious, as of the Valuation

367 Mr. Popovic testified as follows:
Q. Okay. So, that this might be a circumstance in which, even if somebody thought computers, you know, sort
of the massive mainframes that you had in 1960, would have qualified as office equipment in 1960, this might be
an instance to use the common-sense clause in 2019 or 2018?
A. And if the common-sense clause would have resulted in a different value or a more reasonable conclusion,
then absolutely, but because these assets are network equipment that have generally a longer life and the company
has been using them for in excess of 10 years, and as I said, the result is assets above 10 years, 11 years not—
have virtually no value, and those around 10 years have about 20 cents on the dollar of value which we would
typically consider a pretty reasonable floor. There isn’t really a reason to make a lower life, one year
compounding it with the deflationary trend.

Q...performed a reasonableness analysis. You start with the 5 percent, and then you explained to Ms. Reid that,
well, when you put the 5 percent, which yields this implied 20-year useful life, but then you put it with the trend
method of valuation, you put the whole package together, the result is reasonableness. So you were, in the end,
applying a reasonableness test.
THE WITNESS: That's correct.

Date, 1 August 2016, that the estimate of a 20-year useful life would yield a wholly

unrealistic rate of depreciation and would artificially inflate the valuation.

There is no compelling reason to insist on a 5% depreciation rate when in the
circumstances, the Second Schedule offers the alternative of a “reasonable rate test”.
Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts the PwC evidence that the valuation should employ a

20% depreciation rate to GRENLEC’s computer equipment.

Customer Contribution to the Cost of Installing Supply Lines to the Private Premises
Distant by 400 Feet or More (EC $4.6 Million)

There is an EC $7 million discrepancy in the valuation of transmission assets between the
company’s 2016 unaudited financial statements and the fixed asset register on which Mr.
Popovic relies*® The higher figure in the fixed asset register represents the cost of the
transmission assets, while the lower figure in the financial statements includes a deduction

for customer contributions to the installation of branch power lines.>”°

In considering whether and to what extent these customer payments are refundable and
therefore should be recognized as a liability,*”! PwC recognizes a liability of EC $7 million,
referring to the contribution as “contra-assets”. FTI recognizes only a lesser liability of EC

$2.4 million.
The Claimants’ expert Mr. Ellison explained the issue as follows:

What happens here, sir, is that if a customer is more than 400 feet away
from the supply line, he has to pay GRENLEC for the cost of installing an
electricity supply line to his house — from his house to the main line going
down the road. That line is the property of GRENLEC, that has to be paid
for by the customer, and PwC and Mr. Popovic and I all agree that the
asset — that line — should be included in the valuation of GRENLEC as an
asset. There is no dispute about that. The issue is whether it is right to
treat that cash coming in as, in effect, a profit or an offset against the cost,

 

sion

is probably more accurate, or whether it should be carried forward and
recognized over the life of the line.

...but the current position appears to be that some of it [the customer
contribution] is repayable, in which case I would agree with you that it
should be or potentially repayable [to the customer] — not repayable,
potentially repayable - in which case I agree it should be set up as a
liability. And for that reason I moved my figure down from 7 million
to 4 million in the slides.

Q So, again, just to be clear for the record, to make this adjustment, you’re
relying on information that you got from GRENLEC within the last week?

A. Yes.>” (emphasis added)

In the Tribunal’s view, the entire EC $7 million should be treated as a GRENLEC
liability. Mr. Ellison acknowledges that at least a portion of the EC $7 million should be
recognized as a liability based on a conversation with a GRENLEC employee “within the
past week”. This is a situation where GRENLEC controlled and managed by the Claimants
has relevant information which has not been made available in a timely way to the
Respondent (or indeed to the Claimants’ expert, Mr. Ellison). In the circumstances, the
Claimants having failed to cause GRENLEC to produce information uniquely within their
control in a form that could be tested by the Respondent, it should be inferred that

production of such information would not have assisted the Claimants’ case.

Should the Valuation Include an Amount Equivalent to “Customs and Import
Duties” That Were Never Paid? (EC $754,000)

Part I of the Second Schedule requires the calculation of “replacement cost (including
customs and import duties) of each such fixed asset.”*7> FTI interprets the term “customs
and import duties” to mean “customs and import duties’ that would have been paid ‘but
for’ the exemption granted to GRENLEC under Section 13 of the 1994 ESA”. PwC, on the

other hand would exclude any value attributed to unpaid customs and import duties.

ranscript, 19 June 2019, p. 799, Il. 7-21; p. 896, I. 18 to p. 897, 1. 6.
*3 Ex. CE-0005, Second Schedule, Part I. The ESA valuation methodology requires ESA goodwill to be calculated
net of a deduction for “all customs and import duties (excluding customs and import duties on fuel) which the
Company would, but for the provision of Section 13, have had to pay during the aforementioned five completed
financial years of the company.” (Ibid., Part II)

Part I of the Second Schedule, the Claimants argue, is clear that replacement cost is to be

374 and no account is to be taken of

calculated “including customs and import duties,
GRENLEC’s prior exemption under section 13 of the 1994 ESA.*”> Part I does not call for
a determination of what GRENLEC actually paid for its assets, but what a third party which
does not enjoy the immunity would have to pay to replace them>”° following the 2016 laws
which eliminated the tax exemption. This reading of Part I, FTI argues, “harmonizes
perfectly with Part II,*”’ which also adopts the perspective of any market participant”, that
is, one who does not benefit from GRENLEC’s exempted status and who, in determining
GRENLEC’s profitability, would discount profits attributable solely to GRENLEC’s
special exemption from customs and import duties. The Respondent’s position is that the
Claimants should not get credit for a sum equivalent to customs and import duties that they

never paid.

In the Tribunal’s view, replacement cost of a fixed asset necessarily includes “customs
and import duties” because, as of the Valuation Date, 1 August 2016, the cost of replacing
the plant and equipment would necessarily include the payment of customs and import

duties at the time of importation.

Thus, while GRENLEC’s history of tax exemption would properly be reflected in a
calculation of book value and depreciation, the value of fixed assets as of the Valuation

Date cannot be discounted on the basis of a tax exemption that no longer existed.

aforementioned five completed financial years of the Company” (Ex. CE-0005).

Whether the Claimants’ Valuation of Fixed Assets Wrongly Included Assets
Destroyed in Hurricane Ivan? (EC $22.5 Million)
Hurricane Ivan, the worst natural disaster in Grenada’s recent history, caused massive

damage across the island, including to the national electricity grid.*”*

The Respondent claims that 80% of GRENLEC’s transmission lines were damaged or
destroyed. However, Mr. Popovic’s analysis assumes that only 18% of the transmission
and distribution assets on the fixed asset register were damaged or destroyed.*”
He therefore includes in his valuation, according to the Respondent, assets which no longer

exist as part of the enterprise.

It is common ground that much of the repair work was donated pro bono by other
Caribbean countries, especially Cuba. However, no records were kept of whose workers
did what and where. All that is known is that GRENLEC spent EC $17.4 million to put its

system back together.

Mr. Popovic assumed that the repair work (e.g. resurrecting power lines) was done by

pro bono labour, and that the EC $17.4 million was spent on replacement of “completely

destroyed assets”.*®?

578 See e.g., Ex. RE-0029 (estimating that, as a result of Hurricane Ivan, 80% of GRENLEC’s distribution system was

aged).

by PwC, in support of the Counter-Memorial submission and as reflected in Mr. Mudge’s expert report. See also

38 Mr. Popovic testified:

Q. Okay. So, just so I understand, we had established that GRENLEC has stated and nobody disputes, that
80 percent of the T&D system was damaged to some extent by Hurricane Ivan; correct?

A. That’s correct.

Q. Okay. But your assumption is that the replacement costs that would be associated with fixing that system
would only be equivalent to 18 percent of those assets?

 

A. Not fixing, but replacing completely destroyed assets.
Q. Okay. So, you made an assumption again, because nobody has information about this, that all of the money
that GRENLEC spent was to replace assets that had been destroyed or had been so damaged that they were
effectively destroyed, and that anything that was repaired was repaired pro bono?

A. That’s correct.

The significance of attributing the entire EC $17.4 million to replacement rather than repair
is because “replacement” produces a new asset, shorter depreciation and higher value.**!
In Mr. Popovic’s view, the proportionate value of assets destroyed must be equal to the

proportionate value of assets replaced.**”
GRENLEC’s T&D system (EC $17.4 million) from the historical cost of GRENLEC’s

(pre-Ivan) T&D assets, and added the same amount to the cost of GRENLEC’s (post-Ivan)

He thus removed the full cost of restoring

T&D assets. The Claimants say FTI’s calculation is conservative because the amount

Q. Okay. And as we said yesterday, the choice between replacement and repairs has an effect on valuation;
right?
A. It does.
Q. Okay. Because all other things being equal, if you decide that money was spent on replacement, it means
you have a new asset, shorter depreciation, higher value; right?
A. That's correct. (Transcript, 20 June 2019, p. 1065, Il. 1-9.

RRR
...I would assign no value to it [pro bono labour] because it didn’t increase the value of the network, so it
happened, a cost was spent, that cost repaired the existing assets and they were placed back in service. I didn’t
add a value. I think that’s consistent. (Transcript, 20 June 2019, p. 1067, 1. 19 to p. 1068, 1. 2).

RRR
Q...So, you chose, as you testified yesterday, to assume that 100 percent of the $17.4 million was used for
replacement, that every single dollar was used to replace destroyed assets; right?

 

A. Yeah, that combination of material and labor associated with that 17.4, 100 percent to replacement.
(Transcript, 20 June 2019, p. 1068, 1. 22 to p. 1069, 1. 6)

eR EE

My understanding is the labor component of that 17.4 about 20 percent, and that’s why we ultimately made
that assumption. (Transcript, 20 June 2019, p. 1077, Il. 6-8).

hus, Popovic I states as follows:

In my valuation, I assumed that, since GRENLEC fully restored its T&D system in 2004-2005 following
Hurricane Ivan, the amount spent to do so was a reasonable estimate of the damage caused. That amount
was EC $17.4 million (consisting of the entire Hurricane Insurance Reserve Fund then available and EC $1.4
million in GRENLEC cash). I thus assumed that EC $17.4 million of the total historical costs had been
replaced following Hurricane Ivan and was thus to be depreciated from that date. I depreciated the balance
from the (much) earlier date of initial acquisition. In contrast, PwC subtracts a much larger proportion of
historical costs (60% of EC $62.2 million) and adds the EC $17.4 million that was spent on repairs as an
addition to historical cost to account for what was replaced. In other words, PwC assumes that Hurricane
Ivan destroyed 60% of GRENLEC’s T&D system (EC $37 million) while restoration cost EC $17.4
million...PwC relies on “third party sources” for its assumption that “60% to 70%...[was] destroyed” and
not placed back into service, while other reports indicate that 80% was merely “damaged” and later repaired
and placed back into service. GRENLEC’s 2004 annual report states the latter conclusion. (Popovic Reply
Report, paras. 4.6.3-4.6.5)

  

 

   

- 120-

GRENLEC spent on restoring the distribution system did not include the significant pro

bono efforts of other Caribbean utilities.**?

317. Mr. Robert Mudge, retained by the Respondent, considered it reasonable to assume a much

greater level of destruction than the 18% assumed by Mr. Popovic.

318. The Tribunal accepts that in the absence of contemporaneous records, it is difficult to
assess precisely the damage inflicted on GRENLEC’s fixed assets and thus on its valuation.
The only solid figure is the global expenditure by GRENLEC of EC $17.4 million. It
seems reasonable to assume, as did Mr. Popovic, that the pro bono workers from abroad
were largely assigned to repairing the transmission and distribution system, which is the

type of work they were used to performing in their home countries.

319. Mr. Popovic assumed 80% of the EC $17.4 million was for equipment (almost EC $14

million). New equipment would add value to the fixed asset register.

320. As to the other 20%, the installation of new equipment required labour and that labour
required to make operational new equipment also added net value to the GRENLEC
operation and, according to Mr. Popovic, such labour is properly “capitalized” in the value

of the asset.**4

  

* Blanchard II, para. 59, footnote 77.

384 Mr. Popovic testified as follows:
Q...to my mind “repair” involves obviously some labor, to put an asset back into the condition that it can be
used; “replacement” appears to suggest actually acquiring a new asset, which is less of a labor issue and more
of materials or equipment issue.
THE WITNESS: Yeah, | think the distinction is exactly that. It is, when I think about a replacement, it is the
labor to install that asset. And when they capitalize an asset, for instance, all the assets that remained on the
Fixed Asset Listing that would have been destroyed, they would have included installation; right, in that — in
the Fixed Asset Listing. All those Fixed Assets would have included installation. So, when we are — when
we are thinking about the repair of an asset, we wouldn’t add additional repair value because it already exists
within the Fixed Asset Listing when it was first installed. If we took into account the pro bono labor and
said, “Oh, they spent this amount of money on repair,” that’s labor, and then we added that to the existing
listing, the assets in the existing listing that were aged, we'd be double-counting labor because they have a
labor component on the original installation, and that’s really the full value of the installation labor. The
repair doesn’t extend the life of the It’s just an expense spent to get that original asset back in its
working condition, with all the value associated with that original asset.

In the Tribunal’s view, Mr. Popovic made a reasonable extrapolation from the one
“known” and important fact that GRENLEC spent EC $17.4 million on repair and
replacement. Mr. McLellan, who operated with even fewer facts than did Mr. Popovic,

was unable to provide a convincing argument to the contrary.

In the result, the Tribunal accepts Mr. Popovic’s analysis of the financial impact of

Hurricane Ivan on GRENLEC’s fixed assets.

Conclusion

The Tribunal will therefore proceed to an assessment of compensation according to the

Second Schedule.

Tribunal Decision on Second Schedule Calculation EC $7000
As claimed (revised Ellison-Popovic figures) $361,882
Tribunal adjustments

Amendment to value of buildings $0

Amendment to value of other fixed assets $0

Deferred tax liability $0

Contributions to hurricane reserve -$10,000

ESA depreciation -$7,300

Customer contributions to line extensions -$4,600

Accounts Receivable -$2,271

Non-PPE fixed assets (customs duties) $0

Customs Duties $0

Other $0

Total Tribunal adjustments -$24,171
Second Schedule Valuation per the Tribunal $337,711

Accordingly, making the appropriate adjustments, the Tribunal concludes that the
Claimants are entitled to be compensated under the Second Schedule in the amount of 50%
of EC $337.711 million, being EC $168.8555 million or USD $62.53907 million. From
this figure should be deducted the EC $11.1 million paid to the Claimants by way of
GRENLEC dividends from and after the date of the Repurchase Event (as hereinafter
discussed). Therefore, the quantum of Second Schedule Compensation is assessed at EC

$168.8555 million minus EC $11.1 million = EC $157.7555 million or USD $58,427,962.

XI. THE CLAIMANTS’ REQUEST FOR PRE-AWARD AND POST-AWARD
INTEREST

325. The Claimants seek interest on the Award from 3 May 2017 until payment at the Grenadian
Prime Lending Rate of 6%, compounded semi-annually.*** The Claimants request the

same rate and compounding period in respect of post-Award interest.
326. The award of interest is discretionary.
327. The Respondent disputes any entitlement to pre-award interest on the grounds that:

(a) the Parties’ claims, including the Claimants’ remedies, are governed by Grenadian

law,?8° and Grenadian law would not award interest in these circumstances;

(b) there existed a good faith dispute between the GOG and the Claimants that justified

the non-payment of compensation until the Award.

A. Grenadian or International Law?

328. The Claimants argue that an ICSID tribunal sits as an international tribunal applying
international law. There is jurisprudence constante awarding compound interest in
investor-state disputes.*°” Where, as here, “the claimant could have received compound

interest merely by placing its money in a readily available and commonly used investment

vehicle, it is neither logical nor equitable to award the claimant only simple interest.”**

329. Moreover, the Claimants say, Grenadian law also awards compound interest on payment
found to have been wrongfully withheld. The House of Lords in Sempra Metals noted that
“TiJn the nature of things the proof required to establish a claimed interest loss will depend
upon the nature of the loss and the circumstances of the case,” and that “the loss may be
loss of an opportunity to invest the promised money.”**? WRB is a sophisticated investor
and would have invested the repurchase proceeds on receipt.*°? WRB would have earned
a return with compound interest, as “almost all financing and investment vehicles involve

compound interest.”*?!

330. In response, the Respondent refers to Sections 27 and 27A of the West Indies Supreme
Court Act. Section 27 governs the award of pre-award interest and states that “nothing in
this section...shall authorise the giving of interest upon interest,” that is, compound
interest.*°? Section 27A, governing the award of interest on a “judgement debt,” likewise
provides only for a default rate of simple interest at six per cent per annum.** Moreover,
as Sempra Metals confirms, in cases “granting specific performance,” as WRB and GPP
seek, “equity commonly awards simple interest only.”*** In any event, the Claimants’

claim fails for lack of proof, per Lord Nicholls in Sempra at paragraph 96:

[AJn unparticularised and unproved claim simply for “damages” will not
suffice. General damages are not recoverable. The common law does not
assume that delay in payment of a debt will of itself cause damage. Loss
must be proved.*”

331. The Respondent says that the Claimants have failed to demonstrate any such loss.

39 As explained in Memorial (paras. 63-66), GPP sent its repurchase demand notice to Respondent on 22 March 2017,
which started a 30-day period for Respondent to repurchase GPP’s GRENLEC shares pursuant to Section 7.9(b) of
the SPA. On 3 April 2017, GPP agreed to extend the 30-day period to 3 May 2017.

The Tribunal has concluded that the GOG ought to have completed the GRENLEC share
Repurchase on 3 May 2017 following the abrogation and narrowing of GRENLEC’s
monopoly by the 2016 legislation that came into effect on 1 August 2016.

The Award of interest and the compounding period, if any, is a matter for the Tribunal’s
discretion. The source of the Tribunal’s remedial authority is the ICSID Convention and

Rules of Procedure not the West Indies Supreme Court Act.

The Respondent has portrayed the Claimants throughout these proceedings as relentless
capitalists determined to maximize their return on capital. The Tribunal has no doubt that
had the repurchase price been paid on 3 May 2017, the Claimants would have made an

income-generating investment forthwith.

Did the Government Have a Good Faith Dispute with the Claimants Under the SPA
so as to Deny the Claimants Any Entitlement to Pre-Award Interest
The Respondent argues that the SPA relieves the GOG of any obligation to pay pre-award
interest because of Section 7.9(c) of the SPA, which provides:

In the event of any good-faith dispute between the Parties concerning

whether a Repurchase Event has occurred, the GOG shall be entitled

to withhold its payment in respect thereof until the arbitration proceedings
with respect thereto have been completed.*° (emphasis added)

The Respondent argues that it “has in good faith disputed the occurrence of any Repurchase
Event,” and pursuant to Section 7.9(c), the obligation to pay the repurchase price arises
only once the Tribunal renders an award, and that any obligation to pay interest can only

run from the date of the award.°°”

The Respondent has admitted the third Repurchase Event subject to its entitlement to the
“extreme of wilful malfeasance” defence. Thus, the issue is whether “extreme or wilful

malfeasance” defence was raised in good faith, as the Respondent says.

(wD Is the Respondent Entitled to a Presumption of Good Faith?

The Respondent points to the letter from the Prime Minister to the Claimants dated 2 May
2017 in which the Prime Minister undertook to address in good faith the Claimants’

demands. *°*

The Tribunal has no reason to doubt the Prime Minister’s good faith, or that of the

Government, generally, in resolving the dispute.

At issue, however, is the much narrower issue of whether the “extreme or wilful
malfeasance” allegations were made in good faith or raised ex post facto as a late-blooming
defence. Any presumption of good faith would be a rebuttable presumption, and the
Claimants allege that the documentary record shows conclusively that the “malfeasance”

issue is a lawyer’s after-the-fact concoction.

(2) Does the Documentary Record Confirm or Deny the “Good Faith” of the
Malfeasance Allegation?

The Respondent relies upon a letter dated 2 May 2017, from the Attorney General of
Grenada to the Claimants advising that, “[a]s [Claimants] are aware, under Section 7.9(c)
of the SPA, the Government is under no obligation to make any payment if there is a good-
faith dispute between the Parties concerning whether a Repurchase Event has
occurred.”*°? The Respondent then identified additional correspondence over the years

400

which, it says, establishes historical roots to its claim of malfeasance,*”” thus corroborating

its good faith.

As to whether the particulars of the “good faith” issue ought to have been disclosed earlier,

the Respondent relies on the Tribunal’s comment in pre-hearing proceedings that “[t]he

Respondent is not obliged to answer a case which has not yet been formally set out in a

Claimants’ Memorial.’”*°!

The Claimants’ position is that there was no “good faith” dispute but only a contrived
“wilful malfeasance” defence concocted after the event “in a manner that violates [the
Respondent’s] obligations under the SPA, and its litigation strategy, far from justifying a
departure from the ordinary payment of pre-award interest, mandates such payment.”#°?
The GOG’s chief fact witness, Minister Bowen, seemed blissfully unaware of the
malfeasance allegation, the Claimants say, when he affirmed on the witness stand that the

Government would have been happy to have continued with the Claimants as “its

electricity partner”:
Q. And I take it that one possible outcome of those discussions was the

WRB would remain a shareholder in GRENLEC and remain a partner with
the Government?

A. Yes, that is right.4%

Hk a ak a

Q. Now, as a public servant, is it your practice to allow willful malfeasors
to remain partners with the Government in the electricity sector?

A. No. That’s something we would not really look forward to, provided
we had information on exactly what was going on at the point in time.“

If the Government had no “information” about alleged wilful malfeasance in the 2016
negotiations, it could not have been advancing in good faith a “wilful malfeasance” defence

at the time of the 2016 legislation abrogating the 80-year monopoly.

The Claimants consider it “inconceivable” that the GOG would tolerate a wilful malfeasor
as its primary partner in the electricity sector, a view the Claimants say is corroborated by

the documentary record:

in its letter dated 27 April 2016, the Government did not allege WRB to be a wilful
misfeasor. It simply stated that “the public interest must be viewed as overriding
to the interests of WRB/GRENLEC” but expressed its “commitment to retaining
WRB/GRENLEC as a relevant player in the development of the [Grenadian] energy

sector”;4°

on 2 May 2017, one day before the expiry of the extended period for the
Government to complete the repurchase of GPP’s shares, the Government wrote to
GPP, stating that it had “not accepted or agreed to the GPP Demand”*”* but did not

allege “wilful malfeasance” or any other misconduct by Claimants;

on 9 May 2017, the Government said in a media release: “Our desire is to see WRB

remain engaged in Grenada’s electricity market”;4””

on 1 June 2017, Prime Minister Mitchell declared that the Government’s
“wholehearted desire [was] to continue to have WRB here as a partner in

[Grenada’s] development”;*°*

the Government’s stated reasons for adopting the 2016 ESA were not to address
any alleged “wilful malfeasance” by the Claimants, but rather to “put Grenada’s
energy sector on a more sustainable economic and environmental footing,”*” to

create “a more competitive energy sector,”*!” to “open[] the sector to domestic and

(f) the Government’s “Explanatory Memorandum” outlining the rationale for the 2016
ESA, did not identify any concerns with the Claimants’ management of

GRENLEC;*!5

(g) The Government’s failure to follow the procedural terms of the “wilful
malfeasance” exception under Section 7.9(a)(iv) of the SPA also suggests that its

invocation of the exception was an afterthought.

It was only in its 29 June 2018 Counter-Memorial (15 months after the Repurchase
Demand and almost two years after the enactment of the 2016 ESA) that the Government

for the first time contended that Claimants were guilty of “wilful malfeasance”.

In the Tribunal’s view, there is no doubt that the Respondent has a “good faith” belief
that the Claimants are not good corporate citizens and that their control of GRENLEC was,
in the end, terminated in what the Government viewed as the public interest. Nevertheless,
the issue of good faith in enacting the 2016 legislation is not the same thing as good faith
in advancing a “wilful malfeasance” defence to negate the Repurchase Event created by
curtailment of the monopoly. Any presumption of good faith in respect of the
“malfeasance” allegation is rebuttable, and the documentary record refutes any contention
that GOG’s good faith extended to the allegations first made in the Counter-Memorial of
“extreme or wilful malfeasance” of such a nature “and to such a degree” as to relieve the

Respondent of the obligation to pay Second Schedule compensation as required by Section

7.9 of the SPA. The Respondent’s argument never convincingly addressed the

proportionality requirement.

It is true that in December 1999, the local Directors expressed strong criticism of WRB at
a press conference but, there is no contemporaneous evidence these criticisms were
endorsed (or shared) by the Government of the day. Thereafter there were, as would be
expected in the operation of a monopoly utility over 22 years, disagreements and criticisms
of GRENLEC management. However, these criticisms do not justify the submission that
the Respondent declined to complete the Repurchase because of good faith belief in a

malfeasance defence.

The Tribunal concludes that had the Respondent seriously considered the Claimants guilty
of “extreme or wilful malfeasance” before the exigencies of this litigation required coming
up with a defence, the GOG would have applied to an ICSID tribunal for a Section 7.9(c)
declaration of “extreme or wilful malfeasance” prior to abrogating the 80-year monopoly.
In that way, the Respondent could have put in issue the Claimants’ stewardship of
GRENLEC without triggering a Repurchase Event, and thereby avoided the risk to which
it is now exposed, namely a no-escape exposure to the allegedly harsh compensation

provisions of the Second Schedule.

There is no reason why the Respondent should benefit from the use of more than USD $58
million for almost three years without payment of interest. Accordingly, the Tribunal
orders pre and post Award interest from 3 May 2017 until payment of the Award (including
interest and cost) at the rate fixed from time to time for Grenada 91-day Treasury Bills

compounded annually.

The Award Should Take Into Account GRENLEC Dividends Paid After the
Valuation Date?

The wrongful refusal of the GOG to repurchase the shares left the Claimants as unwilling
shareholders in GRENLEC, with continued management control and responsibilities. In

the exercise of that control, the Claimants caused GRENLEC to continue to pay dividends

- 130-

to GPP amounting to EC $11.1 million up to 26 July 20194'®, The Tribunal is thus faced

with a number of options:

(a) the Claimants’ demand for pre-judgment interest with no deduction for GRENLEC
dividends of EC $11.1 million up to 26 July 2019;4!”

(b) in the alternative, the Claimants cannot keep both dividends and collect pre-Award
interest because pre-Award interest presupposes the Claimants would have taken
the proceeds of the repurchase and made a revenue-generating investment
elsewhere, whereas in fact the “proceeds” remained invested in GRENLEC
(however unwillingly). The Claimants, it might be said, cannot be the beneficiary
of a double investment. On this view, having caused dividends to be paid on the
GRENLEC shares, the Claimants would not be entitled to pre-Award interest on

the same monies notionally invested elsewhere;

(c) the Claimants might be allowed pre-Award interest, on the net Award after first

deducting a set-off equivalent to the amount of the GRENLEC dividends;

(d) a fourth option is that the Claimants receive no pre-Award interest at all but that

any compensation awarded for GRENLEC shares be reduced by the amount of the

dividends received.*!®

416 The Claimants’ letter to the Tribunal, dated 26 July 2019, at p. 8.

417 [hid., at p. 8:
Claimants are not aware of any authority that, in a claim by a shareholder for specific performance of a put
option, the receipt of dividends by the shareholder affects its claim to pre-award interest for breach of the put
option. Nor has Respondent argued, let alone formally claimed, that the amount of dividends received by
GPP should be offset against any pre-award interest awarded by the Tribunal (and any such claim presented
at this late stage would be untimely and inadmissible).

418 Letter from the Respondent, dated 26 July 2019, at p. 4:
That cannot be right. On Claimants’ case, they should have received a certain amount of money for their
shares on 3 May 2017.16 Had that happened, Claimants would have ceased to be shareholders, and thus
would have received no dividends between 3 May 2017 and the date of the award. Instead, the dividends
that Claimants actually received during that period would have been received by the new shareholder — the
Government, or whichever third party ultimately purchased the shares from the Government. Thus, on
Claimants’ own case, any compensation for their shares must be reduced by the amount of dividends they
received between 3 May 2017 and the date of the award.

In the Tribunal’s view, the third option is the most appropriate. The Claimants are not
entitled to double compensation. Interest is only payable on monies which the Claimants

have been denied. The relevant calculation appears above at paragraph 324.

COUNTERCLAIM

The Respondent’s counterclaim alleges “unfair prejudice and oppression” under Section

241 of the Companies Act of Grenada‘?

which specifically prohibits companies and their
directors from taking any action that is “oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to, or that

unfairly disregards the interests of [] any shareholder.*”°

The Respondent has not quantified its counterclaim. It requests that “the amount be

determined in the course of these proceedings.”*?!

According to the Respondents, there are no jurisdictional or other legal impediments to the
Government’s counterclaim being brought into these proceedings. The Tribunal is

competent to determine “[a]ny dispute or difference between the Parti rising out of or

 

in connection with” the SPA.*?? The subject matter of the claim is “GPP’s direct
shareholding (and WRB’ s indirect shareholding) in GRENLEC.”*?? Pursuant to Article 46
of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal may thus “determine any incidental or additional

claims or counterclaims” with respect of the Claimants’ shareholding in GRENLEC.
In particular, the Respondent alleges:

(a) the Claimants have used their management powers and their casting vote on the

Board of Directors to run roughshod over the Respondent’s and other minority

419 Counter-Memorial, para. 322.
#20 Ex, RE-0007, s. 241(2).

shareholders’ rights. Through their actions, WRB and GPP have routinely unfairly

prejudiced the Government and its rights;

the Caterpillar purchase “debacle” — including, but not limited to, the deleterious
effect on the electricity supply when the generators WRB pushed to acquire over
the objections of the Grenadian directors on the Board began to suffer serious

problems;**

the Claimants’ significant improprieties in relation to the declaration and payment
of dividends to the detriment of the Company, regardless of the need for capital
investment to ensure its continued health of the utility.47° There is no evidence that
the Claimants have made any new equity investments in GRENLEC since the initial
purchase in 1994,;46

the Claimants took steps to obscure how GRENLEC actually funded the Special
Dividend of EC $57 million through the CIBC loans;

WRB’s and GPP’s excluded shareholders and their representatives from the
decision-making to evaluate “legal actions that may be filed by the company (either
directly or on behalf of shareholders), as well as supporting legal actions that may
be filed by various shareholders, including the company’s strategic investor

[GPP}’*?’ in response to the 2016 reform package;

causing GRENLEC to fund the dispute over GPP’s shares*”* — even though any

recovery on their claims in this arbitration would go to Claimants, not the Company.

357. The Claimants’ position is that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to deal with the

counterclaim which is predicated on an alleged breach not of the SPA but of Grenadian

law, and thus falls outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal which, under Article 25(1) of

4 See supra Section VIII.C.(1).

- 133 -

the ICSID Convention (which governs this arbitration) is limited to disputes arising directly

out of an investment:

 

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any
constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the
Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which
the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When
the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent
unilaterally.

358. The Claimants argue that the counterclaim does not arise directly from the SPA, which is

not invoked, but rather from an alleged violation of the Grenadian Companies Act.*”

359. In the Tribunal’s view, ICSID tribunals may accept jurisdiction if it is impractical to
unbundle the claims (i.e. the causes of action “constitute[d] an indivisible whole,”**° and

the parties’ “reciprocal [contractual] obligations had a common origin, identical sources,

and an operational unity.”)**!

360. The allegations advanced in support of the Counterclaim track allegations raised in

defence.

*° The Claimants say the Respondent’s counterclaim is analogous to that in Amco Asia Corporation and others v.
Republic of Indonesia, 1CSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Jurisdiction (10 May 1988) (“Ameo II’), 1 ICSID
Rep. 543 (1993) (Ex. CLA-0085), a case arising out of Indonesia’s seizure of Amco’s investment in a hotel and
subsequent cancellation of Amco’s investment license. Indonesia counterclaimed that Amco had engaged in tax fraud
in breach of Indonesian law. The Amco II Tribunal held that only disputes regarding obligations under an investment
agreement “will fall under Article 25(1) of the [ICSID] Convention,” whereas disputes concerning obligations under
general law “fall to be decided by the appropriate procedures in the relevant jurisdiction.” On the facts, the Amco IT
Tribunal held that “[t]he obligation not to engage in tax fraud is clearly a general obligation of law in Indonesia. It
was not specially contracted for in the investment agreement and does not arise directly out of the investment” as
required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal therefore declined ratione materiae jurisdiction
over the counterclaim. In Saluka Invs. B.V. v. Czech Republic, Decision on Jurisdiction over the Czech Republic’s
Counterclaim (7 May 2004) (“Saluka”) (Ex. CLA-0099), paras. 78-79, the claimant had brought claims against the
Czech Republic under an investment treaty, and the Czech Republic asserted various heads of counterclaim, including
“non-compliance with the general law of the Czech Republic.” The Saluka Tribunal declined jurisdiction over these
counterclaims, finding that “the disputes underlying those heads of counterclaim in principle fall to be decided through
the appropriate procedures of Czech law and not through the particular investment protection procedures of the
Treaty.”

361. While the Respondent indicated that its quantification of the Counterclaim would emerge
in the course of proceedings, it never did, not even in the Respondent’s closing

submissions.

362. The facts alleged in supporting the Counterclaim have not been established. Accordingly,

the counterclaim is dismissed but without costs.

XIIL. COSTS

A. The Parties’ Request for Costs

363. The Claimants have submitted a claim for costs of USD $8,156,400.51 plus interest
(including advances made to ICSID). The Respondent seeks USD $5,916,030.36
(including advances made to ICSID). The Parties have conferred and each advises that
“both sides’ costs were actually incurred and were reasonable in amount.”*** The questions
before the Tribunal are whether either side’s costs should be shifted to the opposing side

and if so in what amount.

364. The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD $)

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts. As

a result, each Party’s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD $239,972.37.45

There is no doubt of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to award costs in respect of counsel and the
experts as well as the costs of ICSID. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as

follows:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the
parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those
expenses, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges for the use
of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part
of the award.

The first Claimant, WRB Enterprises Inc., is a Florida company. In that jurisdiction, the
“American rule” generally applies under which, as stated by the United States Supreme
Court, “parties are ordinarily required to bear their own attorney’s fees — the prevailing
party is not entitled to collect from the loser.”*** On the other hand, Grenada generally
follows the British practice of “loser pays”. However, even under “loser pays” the winner
does not necessarily obtain full indemnification. A distinction is made between
“indemnity” costs (as are sought here by the Claimants) and “standard costs” which may
be somewhat less, and which have to satisfy a test of proportionality as well as

reasonableness. **>

Relevant Factors

In Home Office v. Lownds, the Lord Chief Justice for England and Wales identified a
number of factors relevant to “reasonableness” and “proportionality” in the assessment of
costs. The English guidelines are codified in amendments to the Civil Procedure Rules but

in the Tribunal’s opinion the guidelines reflect the evolving common law approach to cost

raised;
the relative success of the contending parties;

whether a claimant which has succeeded in its claim in whole or in part exaggerated

its claim;
the financial position of each party;

the manner in which a party has pursued or defended its case or a particular

allegation or issue before as well as during the proceedings;

the efforts made, if any, before and during the proceedings in order to try to resolve

the dispute, including any payment into court or admissible offer of settlement;
the skill, effort, specialized knowledge and responsibility involved;
the time spent on the case;

whether it was reasonable for a party to raise, pursue or contest a particular

allegation or issue.

The Tribunal comments on these factors as follows:

(a)

the Claimants suggest that the amount in dispute (excluding interest) is in excess of
USD $65 million. The Claimants have been substantially successful on most
aspects of their claim. Indeed, it is evident that their recovery of Second Schedule
compensation very substantially exceeds the Fair Market Value of their GRENLEC

shares;

the claim is of substantial monetary importance to the Claimants. The GRENLEC
shares constitute their major corporate asset. So far as the Respondent is concerned,
the importance of the case is the “repatriation” of the controlling shares in the
virtual monopoly supplier of electricity in the country. The Respondent’s view was
and is that if the Claimants are entitled to anything they should receive no more
than Fair Market Value. The Claimants, not surprisingly, insist on the substantial
premium agreed to in the Share Purchase Agreement. The Tribunal’s Award will
put a significant dent in Grenada’s public finances. In other words, the case is of

great importance to both Parties;

from the Claimants’ perspective this was a simple collection case. They complain
that unnecessary complexities were added by the Respondent in its resistance to the

inevitable;

subject to some downward adjustments in the assessment of compensation, the

Claimants have enjoyed substantial success;

although the Respondent considers the Claimants’ case to be exaggerated, the

Claimants’ claim to Second Schedule compensation has prevailed;
both sides had ample resources to fund the arbitration;

the Claimants protest that the Respondent raised issues which “repeatedly and
unjustifiably increased the complexity of the dispute and Claimants’ costs.”**° This
is true; however, when it is considered that compensation calculated in accordance
with the Second Schedule greatly exceeds the fair market value of the GRENLEC
shares, and that the Respondent is responsible to its electorate for the expenditure
of public funds, the Respondent’s search for partial or even complete relief is
understandable. In the particular circumstances of this case the “manner of

presentation” is not a significant factor in the award of costs;

although government officials expressed a desire to negotiate in good faith a “fair”
settlement, the Tribunal is not aware of any compromises being offered by either

side. In any event there was no binding offer of settlement;
the case was comprehensively and skillfully presented by both sides;

the time spent on the case is of some concern. For example, the Claimants explain
at footnote 38 of their Submission on Costs that “the legal fees and costs associated
with the Claimants’ application for a Provisional Measure [to restrain the
Government from abusing its regulatory power over GRENLEC to demand
documents in excess of the documentary production ordered by the Tribunal] are
USD $886,596.74, representing fees and costs of White & Case and Mr. Charlie
Friedlander incurred between 9 May 2018 and 8 July 2018. It is true that the
Claimants’ application for the Interim Measure was successful, and was
necessitated by the Government’s effort to “side-step” the agreed procedure for
prehearing discovery of documents, and was therefore criticized by the Tribunal;
nevertheless, the expenditure of USD $886,596.74 on a relatively straight-forward
application to resist the Government’s “regulatory” demand for documents lacks

proportionality, in the opinion of the Tribunal;

in the Tribunal’s view it was unreasonable for the Respondent to pursue its
“extreme or willful malfeasance” defense which was at odds with the

contemporaneous documentary evidence.

Relevant ICSID Jurisprudence

While ICSID Tribunals have frequently adopted the principle of “loser pays” this is not

invariably the case. In Krederi Ltd. v. Ukraine,

437 the tribunal followed what it described

as the “traditional practice” that each party bear its own costs “considering that the claims

were not frivolous, were pursued and defended in good faith and with all due expedition.”

In Alvarez y Marin Corporacion v. Republic of Panama,

“38 the tribunal decided that each

(Award, 12 October 2018).

party should bear its own costs and 50% of the arbitration costs.**? ICSID Tribunals have
also expressed concern where there is a significant disparity between the parties’ respective

440

bills of costs. The general principle is that the award of costs may be guided by the

particular facts of each case.

The Claimants do not assert any entitlement to a full cost indemnity as of right. In the
Tribunal’s view it is appropriate to have regard to the common law principles applicable

to “standard costs” which include the principle of proportionality.

The Proportionality Principle

The proportionality principle was explained by the Lord Harry Woolf, then Lord Chief
Justice of England and Wales, in Home Office v. Lownds**' as follows:

2. Proportionality [formerly] played no part in the taxation of costs under

the Rules of the Supreme Court. The only test was that of reasonableness.

The problem with that test, standing on its own, was that it

institutionalised, as reasonable, the level of costs which were generally

charged by the profession at the time when the professional services were

rendered. If a rate of charges was commonly adopted it was taken to

be reasonable and so allowed on taxation even though the result was
far from reasonable.

Lord Woolf’s concern about automatic acceptance of the “going rate” as “reasonable” is
borne out to some extent by the Claimants’ reference to “the average claimant costs in the
ninety ICSID arbitrations concluded between FY 2011 and FY 2017 [...] was of USD
$6,043,914.93."442 According to the evolving common law on costs, “reasonableness” is

not a matter of the “going rate” but must always be measured against proportionality.

The costs claimed in respect of the Interim Measure is one example of disproportionality.
Another is the costs run up by the Claimants in respect of the “extra pleading”. The
Claimants rightly complained that the Government’s Counter Memorial was deficient
“with respect both to the Statutory Valuation [i.e. the Second Schedule] and the particulars
and valuation of the counterclaim.” This deficiency eventually involved the Claimants and
their experts being permitted to file an additional reply pleading after the Government
belatedly put its materials in evidence. The Claimants seek USD $926,150.82 in respect
of the further filing and associated preparation. Given that the Claimants’ experts had

already worked up the Second Schedule data in preparing their reports filed with the

441 At para. 2.
+2 Claimants Costs Submissions, footnote 43.

377.

378.

#5 See Claimants Costs Submiss

-141-

Memorial, the expenditure of a further USD $926,150.82 seems to the Tribunal to lack

proportionality.

Application of the Tests to the Facts

The Tribunal concludes that some adjustment must be made in the costs of
USD $8,156,400.51 as claimed. In addition to the disproportionality as compared with the
Respondent’s Bill of Costs of USD $5,916,030.36, the Tribunal has already commented on
the disproportionate USD $886,596.74 expended on the Interim Measures application in
respect of a documents demand and the USD $926,150.82 in respect of the “extra
pleading”. The Tribunal further notes that the Claimants caused GRENLEC to pay USD
$522,353.15 for legal and accounting fees in 2016 and 2017 that ought to have been paid
from the outset by the Claimants. The inappropriateness of this payment has belatedly
been acknowledged by the Claimants who undertook to repay said sum of USD

$522,353.15 to GRENLEC.“?

The Tribunal notes a number of additional concerns. For example, the Claimants seek
USD $33,332.50 for an opinion from Professor Jan Paulsson concerning enforcement of
the “governing law” provision of the Special Purchase Agreement. The Respondent rightly
challenged the admissibility of an expert opinion on a question of international law. The
Tribunal agreed that Professor Paulsson’s opinion simply constituted additional legal
argument. The contents of the Paulsson report were adopted by the Claimants as part of
their argument but, in the respectful opinion of the Tribunal, added little to the submissions

already being made by Mr. Paul Friedland for the Claimants.

The Claimants’ expenditure of USD $926,150.82 just for preparation of the final reply*#

is to be compared with the Respondent’s total claim in respect of its accounting experts
PwC and the Brattle Group for the entire case (including the hearing) of
USD $1,177,261.50, only USD $251,110.07 more, even though the Respondent’s experts

discharged a broader mandate including both a DCF analysis as well as a Second Schedule

 

ns, footnote 1. But the initial miscalculation was disreputable.

analysis whereas the Claimants’ experts were directed to and did focus almost entirely on

the Second Schedule. It is true, of course, that the Tribunal ultimately accepted the expert

evidence of the Claimants, but this was primarily dictated by the Tribunal’s acceptance of

the Claimants’ legal argument that compensation is to be calculated according to the

Second Schedule.

In the circumstances the Tribunal:

(b)

(c)

(d)

acknowledges the Claimants’ undertaking to reimburse GRENLEC for the USD

the advances to ICSID;

reduces the balance of the Claimants’ Bill of Costs of USD $7, 916,428.14 by 20%
(i.e. USD $1,583,285.63) for a resulting sum of USD $6,333,142.51 to be paid by

the Respondent on account of attorney fees and disbursements;

the sum of USD $6,573,114.88 (being USD $239,972.37 plus USD $6,333,142.51)

is therefore added to the Award.

Purchase Agreement (SPA) dated 14 September 1994, namely the 2016 legislative

Grenada Private Power Limited and WRB Enterprises, Inc. v. Grenada
(ICSID Case No. ARB/17/13)

 

Decision on Provisional Measures

1. The Claimants, Grenada Private Power Ltd. and WRB Enterprises, Inc., apply for a
Provisional Measure directing the Respondent Government to withdraw a formal demand for
information concerning Grenlec contained in a letter dated 9 May 2018 to Grenlec from the
Minister of Infrastructure, Development, Public Utilities, Energy, Transport and Implementation,
the Honourable Gregory Bowen.! Attached to the Minister’s letter is an appendix containing seven
categories of documents and a number of subcategories, all of which the Minister seeks under

ss. 44-47 inclusive of the Electricity Supply Act No. 19 of 2016.

2. In a letter from counsel for the Government to counsel for the Claimants the previous day,
8 May 2018, the same appendix was attached. Counsel stated that the information “is not only
necessary to carry out the purposes and duties set out in the Act, and pertinent to the Government’s
exercise of its rights as a shareholder in Grenlec, it is also relevant and material to the issues in
dispute in this arbitration, including the valuation of the Claimants’ shares in Grenlec.” (italics

added)

3. The Claimants’ position is that in fact the Minister’s request has no purpose other than the
arbitration because insofar as financial information of Grenlec is required for the drafting of
regulations, such regulations under the Act have already been drafted, and insofar as the regulatory

function is concerned, the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission* of Grenada (“PURC”) is not

' Exhibit CE-0058.

? Exhibit CE-0057.

3 While both the Minister and the PURC have statutory powers to obtain information from Grenlec, it appears that the
actual regulation is to be performed by PURC at such time as it becomes operational next year.

yet functioning and, according to counsel for the Government, is now not likely to be in operation
until an unknown date in 2019. Accordingly, Claimants allege, the Minister’s initiative is simply
an attempted end run around the agreed documentary production arrangements set out in s. 15 of

Procedural Order No. 1 in this arbitration.

4. The Government’s response is that the regulatory stream and the arbitration stream can
proceed in parallel. Had the Minister asked Grenlec for the information prior to commencement
of the arbitration, Grenlec would have been required to comply. The accidental timing of the
arbitration, according to the Government, should not displace the Government’s sovereign power
to regulate the island electricity system. In any event, it is for the Claimants to establish the
necessity and urgency of the Provisional Measure. It is not for the Government to establish an

urgent need for the Grenlec information.

such other order as the Tribunal deems necessary to protect Claimants’ rights and the integrity of

this proceeding, and costs.

(iti) |The Compelling Justification

9. The Claimants argue that the Government has co-mingled the arbitration function and
regulatory function. The Honourable Gregory Bowen is to be a principal witness for the
Government in the arbitration. The Tribunal’s Order for document production declined to require
the Claimants to produce certain information and documents. The effect of the order would be
nullified if the Government could simply sidestep its effect by having the Minister make a direct

demand of Grenlec using the regulatory power under the Electricity Supply Act 2016.

The Government’s Case

10. The Government points out that it is for the Claimants not only to identify the procedural
right sought to be protected, but to prove that the provisional measure is necessary to avoid a
material risk of serious risk or grave damage to the requesting party’ and urgently required® and
moreover is proportional in that it strikes a fair balance between the Claimants’ need for protection
from the threatened Government’s action on the one hand and any harm that might be caused to

the Respondent Government on the other hand.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/17/13)

 

Decision on Provisional Measures

ANALYSIS

11. In the Tribunal’s opinion there is no doubt that the integrity of the arbitration requires both
parties to abide by Procedural Order No. | and rulings made thereunder. Document production,
and the Tribunal’s resolution of any contested requests, is a key element of a fair procedure.

Protection of the integrity of that procedure is a legitimate objective for a provisional measure.

(i) Necessity

12. The Claimants argue that if the Provisional Measure were granted, the procedural damage
will be done in the course of the Government’s preparation of its pleadings and submissions. The

damage at that stage would be beyond recall.

13. The Government denies any such necessity. In the event documents which the Tribunal
declined to order Grenlec to produce were obtained by the Government under its regulatory
powers, and the Claimants wished to assert that its use in the arbitration amounted to an abuse, the
Claimants could always make a request to the Tribunal to exclude the offending evidence. In the
Tribunal’s view, however, such a procedure would be unworkable (because Minister Bowen would
not be able to rid his mind of the regulatory information) and cumbersome (requiring a close
supervision and perhaps intervention on an item by item basis during the hearing). In any event,
the Government’s suggestion does not resolve the issue of a Government side-step of the agreed

procedure set out in Procedural Order No. 1.

14. Accordingly, the Tribunal is satisfied that the measure is necessary in order to protect the

integrity of the arbitration by holding both parties to the agreed rules of documentary production.

Grenada Private Power Limited and WRB Enterprises, Inc. v. Grenada
(ICSID Case No. ARB/17/13)

 

Decision on Provisional Measures

(ii) Urgency

15. The Tribunal is satisfied that if the provisional measure is not issued, the ministerial
demand will be maintained, and the Tribunal’s order disallowing certain of the Government’s
requests for documents will be rendered ineffective. Moreover, the Government may declare

Grenlec in default and seek administrative sanctions.

(iti) | Proportionality

16. The Tribunal is conscious of the need for the Claimants to demonstrate that the requested
Provisional Measure satisfies a balance of convenience and is proportionate to the respective
interests of the parties. In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants’ request that “the Tribunal direct the
Government to withdraw its information demand” would be a disproportionate intrusion on the
sovereign authority of the Government. (If the Claimants were to take the position that the
Government is not entitled to some categories of information request in the Minister’s letter, such

a contention would be an issue for the Courts of Grenada, not this Tribunal.)

17. Rather than a withdrawal of the demand for information, the integrity of the arbitration

would be satisfied by deferral of the return date stipulated by the Minister.

18. The evidentiary submissions in this case will be completed on 29 March 2019, when the

Government is to file its Rejoinder. At that point, the pleadings will be complete and the

evidentiary record established. Accordingly, the interest of both sides would be protected by a
deferral of the date for compliance with the statutory request for information from Monday, 28
May 2018 until Saturday, 30 March 2019 or as soon thereafter as the Government’s Rejoinder has

been filed.

19. To the extent Grenlec’s response to the Minister’s request yields information relevant to
the arbitration, an application can be made by the Government to adduce fresh evidence prior to

the hearing which is scheduled from 17 to 21 June 2019.

RECOMMENDATION FOR A PROVISIONAL MEASURE

20. Accordingly, the Tribunal recommends by way of Provisional Measure that the
Government defer the date for compliance with the Minister’s letter of 9 May 2018 until Saturday
30 March 2019, and that in the meantime, the Claimants are not to be considered in default of their

informational obligations under the Electricity Supply Act 2016.
