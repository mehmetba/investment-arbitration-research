INTRODUCTION

The Claimant is WNC Factoring Limited (“WNC” or the “Claimant”) a company organized under
the laws of England and Wales. It is represented in this arbitration by Messrs Stephen Jagusch,
Anthony Sinclair, Epaminontas Triantafilou and Philip Devenish of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &
Sullivan, LLP, and Messrs Robert Nemec and Michal Sylla of PRK Partners S.R.O. Advokétni
Kancelaf.

The Respondent is the Government of the Czech Republic (the “Czech Republic” or the
“Respondent”, and together with the Claimant, the “Parties”). It is represented in this arbitration by
Ms Karolina Horakova and Messrs Libor Moravek, Ivan Cisdr and Pavel Kinnert of Weil Gotshal &
Manges, Ms Erica Stein and Messrs Arif Ali and David Attanasiou of Dechert LLP, and Ms Maria
TalaSova of the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic.

The dispute between the Parties concerns WNC’s investment in the acquisition of the company
SKODAEXPORT, as., (“Skoda Export’), a Czech state-owned supplier of turnkey capital
equipment in the energy sector. The Claimant claims that the Czech Republic “provided bidders for
Skoda Export with misleading and inaccurate information during the company’s privatisation,”
obstructed WNC’s attempts to restore the company to profitability, and eventually “forced Skoda
Export into insolvency and caused the complete devaluation of WNC’s investment in the Czech

Republic.”' According to the Claimant, “the Czech Republic is responsible as a matter of
international law for the wrongful treatment to which WNC was subjected” under the Agreement
between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
Government of the Czech and Slovak Republic for the Promotion and Protection of Investments,
signed on 10 July 1990, with Protocol, as amended by Exchange of Notes on 23 August 199] and 24

By letter dated 18 January 2017, the Tribunal invited each of the Parties to make a final
supplementary deposit on costs, with the final amounts for fees and expenses of the Tribunal to be

limited to the balance of the final deposit.

On 7 February 2017, the Respondent submitted a Supplemented and Updated Summary of Costs and
Expenses Incurred by the Czech Republic (the “Supplemented Summary of Costs”) in which it
claimed additional expenses resulting “mainly from invoices which Respondent received and
processed after 30 September 2016 for work performed prior to that date by Mazars LLP, Weil
Gotshal & Manges and Dechert LLP.” By letter dated 9 February 2017, the Claimant objected to
the additional expenses claimed in the Supplemented Summary of Costs. On 11 February 2017, the

Tribunal declined to allow the Respondent’s claim.

By agreement of the Parties’ positions the issues of the Respondent’s Objections to Admissibility
and Jurisdiction, as pleaded and summarized in Part V, were not bifurcated for preliminary
determination. Nonetheless, the Tribunal will consider these as matters pleaded in defence at
paragraphs 293 to 364 below, and then engage the continuing live merits issue in Part VIB., at
paragraphs 365 to 403.

It follows that it suffices for the factual background to be briefly summarized in short following Part
I, with relevant detail being picked up under the following Parts of the Award. As will become
apparent in these reasons, in the result many of the factual issues raised and on which the Parties
joined issue do not fall for determination as they are not material to the sole continuing live merits
issue of expropriation. In the same way, given the dispositive Award dismissing the entire claim, as
set out on page 135 below, the entire issues of Damages and Quantum, summarized in Part V.D

below, also cease to be relevant for determination.

THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS

The Claimant’s case is that the actions and inactions attributable to the Czech Republic in relation to
Skoda Export during the privatization tender and after its acquisition by the Claimant, caused
significant loss to the business of Skoda Export, which obliged the Claimant to withdraw from the

SPA, and thereby deprived the Claimant of the entire benefit of its investment in the Czech Republic.

The impleaded actions and inactions of the Czech Republic are claimed to constitute separate

breaches of its obligations under the BIT:

(1) _ To observe the provisions of the “specific agreements” concluded by the Czech Republic

with respect to the Claimant’s investment (the “Umbrella Clause”) (Article 2(3));

(2) To accord “fair and equitable treatment” and to refrain from “unreasonable or

discriminatory measures” (“FET”) (Article 2(2)); and

(3) Not to expropriate the Claimant’s investment or subject its investment to measures having
effect equivalent to expropriation, except “for a public purpose related to the internal needs
of that Party on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and effective

compensation” (Article 5).°”
The Respondent’s answering position is that:

(1) | The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over any of the Claimant’s claims or alternatively, has no
jurisdiction over any of the Claimant’s claims save for the expropriation claim under
Article 5 of the BIT (the “Jurisdiction and Admissibility Objections”);

The information provided to the Claimant during the privatization process was accurate

and sufficient, and the Claimant failed to carry out due diligence properly;

The economic loss caused to Skoda Export after acquisition by the Claimant resulted from

the Claimant’s mismanagement of the company;

The terms on which the Claimant sought operational financing from the financing

institutions were unreasonable;

The financing institutions operated on commercial terms and did not exercise governmental

authority such as to engage the responsibility of the Czech Republic;

In any event, the Czech Republic took appropriate steps in response to the financial

situation of Skoda Export; and

Accordingly, the Czech Republic has complied with all of its obligations under the BIT.

THE RESPONDENT’S OBJECTIONS

The Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear any of WNC’s BIT claims on

the grounds that:

The arbitration clause of the BIT has been superseded by European Union (“EU”) law; and

Alternatively, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under the terms of the BIT save for the

Admissibility: The intra-EU BIT jurisdictional objection

Article 8(1) of the BIT provides:

Disputes between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party
concerning an obligation of the latter under Articles 2(3), 4, 5 and 6 of this Agreement
in relation to an investment of the former which have not been amicably settled shall,
after a period of four months from written notification of a claim, be submitted to
arbitration under paragraph 2 below if either party to the dispute so wishes.

(1) The Respondent’s position
The Respondent contends that Article 8(1) has been superseded by EU law,®* on the grounds that:

(1) The single market provides complete protection to investors from one Member State
investing in another Member State,*? hence the later treaties on which the EU is founded

have superseded and terminated the BIT, as the earlier agreement; and

(2) The BIT establishes discrimination on grounds of nationality against investors from other
EU Member States who do not benefit from the BIT. It is incompatible with EU law.

The Respondent invokes the recent decisions of the European Commission (“EC”) both to
investigate the award rendered by the tribunal in the Miczla case and to initiate formal and informal
procedures with EU Member States on the grounds that maintaining intra-EU BITs contravenes EU
law.®! On 18 June 2015, the EC confirmed its position that intra-EU BITs are incompatible with EU
law.” Member States of the EU are asserted to “have fallen in line behind the Commission in this

regard”.

For these reasons, the Tribunal must give primacy to EU law, firstly because this is part of
international law applicable between the Contracting Parties to the BIT,“ and secondly because the

BIT is incompatible with EU law as both cover the same subject matter.

(2) The Claimant’s position

The Claimant argues that EU law has not superseded the arbitration clause of the BIT because the
EC Treaty and the BIT do not cover the same subject-matter. A treaty is only to be considered as
terminated by the conclusion of a later treaty if both relate to the same subject matter, according to
Articles 59(1) and 30(3) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.°” The later EU law does

not provide for the type of investor protections embodied in the BIT.

The arbitral tribunals in Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic, Eureko v. Slovakia, and EURAM v.
Slovakia accepted that the EU treaties and the EU law adopted under those treaties do not relate to

the same subject matter as BIT’ or multilateral treaties for the protection of foreign investment.”

with regard the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, observe the
provisions of these specific agreements, as well as the provisions of this Agreement.

The Respondent’s position

The Respondent’s second jurisdictional objection is that the Umbrella Clause in Article 2(3) of the
BIT does not apply to the SPA because this is not an agreement between the Czech Republic and the
Claimant, but is an agreement between the Czech Republic and FITE.” The ordinary meaning of
“specific agreement” under Article 2(3) would be an agreement between the Czech Republic and
WNC." As an agreement between the Czech Republic and FITE, the SPA is not a “specific
agreement” between the Claimant and the Czech Republic.”

The Respondent further contends that Article 2(3) of the BIT does not concern provisions of general
legislation addressed to the general public.” Accordingly, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction
over the alleged breach of Article 2(3) in respect of alleged violations of applicable Czech
legislation.” In any event, to be covered by Article 2(3), a legislative obligation must be specific
and directed at the investment and the investor at issue.” Here, the Claimant has not invoked any
legislative or regulatory provision specifically addressed to itself or its investment in Skoda Export
but rather, “invokes only general statutory and regulatory duties imposed by Czech commercial law

on any seller/owner of the shares”.”*

The Respondent adds that the Claimant has not identified any contractual breaches elevated to the
BIT level,” and asserts that there are no “obligations” under the SPA or Czech law that are capable
of being elevated to the BIT level through Article 2(3).”

The Claimant's position

The Claimant argues that there is no privity of contract requirement in Article 2(3) and it is immaterial
for purposes of Article 2(3) whether the investor concludes the specific agreement with the State
directly, or through an investment vehicle.” Whereas the Respondent's interpretation would permit
it to circumvent the BIT by requiring domestic incorporation as a precondition of investment — as it
did in the present case through Clause 6.1(a) of the SPA® — the object and purpose of the BIT and
the principle of resolving uncertainties in favour of the investor militate in favour of a broad reading
of Article 2(3) and of qualifying the SPA as a “specific agreement”.*!

The SPA includes multiple warranties applying to FITE and its “Affiliates” as defined in Clause
6.1(h) of the SPA, including WNC. The non-compliance of FITE’s shareholders with the
requirements stipulated in the SPA would have triggered the liability of PITE towards the

Respondent.*? Further, the Respondent itself treated WNC’s investment “as a unity”.

(2) Articles 2(3) and Article 3(1)

The Respondent's position

There must be privity between the investor and the host state of the investment in respect of the
specific obligation in order for the claim to fall under the scope of any of the umbrella clauses which
the Claimant seeks to import under the most favoured nation (“MEN”) clause of the BIT. Hence
the BIT’s MFN clause in Article 3 cannot remedy the fact that there is no privity between WNC and
the Czech Republic under the BIT.*

Consequently, any alleged failure to observe Czech legislation is not a ground to invoke Article 2(3)
of the BIT.”

The Claimant's position

For the reasons set forth in the foregoing section, the Claimant asserts that the SPA qualifies as a

“specific agreement” under Article 2(3)."

In the alternative, the Claimant invokes the MFN clause in Article 3(1) of the BIT to rely on more
favourable umbrella clauses in other treaties concluded by the Czech Republic, which dispense with

any privity requirement.”

The Claimant relies on i treaties luded by the R clauses which

cover “any obligation” with regard to or in connection with investments, namely, Article 11(1) of the
Czech Republic-Paraguay BIT, Article 10(2) of the Czech Republic-Lebanon BIT, and Article 15(2)

of the Czech Republic-Singapore BIT.” None of the aforementioned provisions require that the

State’s “obligation” or “commitment” is owed directly to the foreign investor.*!

The Claimant refers to the decisions in EDF v. Argentina and Continental Casualty v. Argentina in
support of the proposition that umbrella clauses may apply to obligations in force between the State
and a subsidiary of the claimant.” Accordingly, Article 2(3) of the BIT, read in conjunction with the
MEN clause in Article 3(1), requires that the Respondent observe its obligations under the SPA and
Czech Jaw, and the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear disputes concerning obligations under the SPA

and Czech law.”

(3) Courts’ exclusive jurisdiction under Clause XIV of the SPA

Clause XIV of the SPA provides: “Any dispute that arises between the Parties based on or in
connection with this Agreement shall be decided by the court in Prague having subject-matter

jurisdiction, unless exclusive jurisdiction of a court is stipulated.”

The Respondent’s position

Even if the SPA were held to be a “specific agreement” within the meaning of Article 2(3), the claims
are inadmissible because the parties to the SPA agreed that all such claims would be heard by the
Czech courts.

Clause XIV of the SPA tracks Section 89a of the Czech Code of Civil Procedure, which at the time
the SPA was concluded allowed parties to choose territorial jurisdiction in selected commercial
matters.°* Hence, once territorial jurisdiction is agreed, it is exclusive. FITE accepted this position

on filing its SPA claims against the Respondent before the courts in Prague.”*

Other investment arbitration tribunals have recognized similarly formulated choice-of-court clauses
as exclusive jurisdiction clauses.” The court decisions cited by the Claimant concern courts whose

jurisdiction was not subject to waiver, agreement or option.**

The Claimant’s position

The Claimant denies that Clause XIV of the SPA is an “exclusive” jurisdiction clause.” Clause XIV,
according to the Claimant, is a “residual” jurisdiction clause. The function of Clause XIV is not to
provide exclusive jurisdiction, but only to indicate that the default rules of the Czech Civil Procedure
remain applicable unless another forum is selected. Since by submitting its claim WNC perfected its
arbitration agreement with the Respondent, the residual jurisdiction clause under Clause XIV is no

longer applicable.!

Even assuming that Clause XIV is an exclusive jurisdiction clause, the Claimant contends that in any
event, its BIT claim under Article 2(3) is not subject to Clause XIV of the SPA because it is not a

contractual claim.'®! The function of Article 2(3) is to guarantee compliance with an underlying

The Tribunal must recognise the res judicata effect of these decisions of the Czech Courts and is
therefore estopped from considering the Claimant's claims under Article 2, paragraph 2 (the FET

claim) and paragraph 3 (the Umbrella Clause claim).’°

The Claimant’s position

The litigation before the Czech courts concerned different claims to those made in this case. It says
that the decisions of the Czech courts “do not address the legal arguments presented before this
Tribunal, including the Respondent’s breaches of its warranties and obligations under the SPA, or
violations of Czech law in conducting the Tender”. The Claimant submits that the courts merely
concluded that the SPA could not be invalidated on the basis that FITE had entered the agreement as

a result of an error induced by the Respondent."

(5) Relationship of Article 8(1) limitations with Article 2(3)

The Respondent’s position

The Respondent argues that the BIT provisions listed in Article 8(1) are exhaustive: if Article 2(3) is
activated by the existence of a “specific agreement”, the words “as well as the provisions of this

account”.'"> The ¢ravaux to the BIT explicitly confirm this interpretation,''* as does the arbitral
1s

jurisprudence.
Article 8(1) of the BIT does not allow claims under Article 2(2) to be arbitrated, and the Tribunal
“cannot allow Claimant to introduce those claims by sneaking in, abusively, through the back door
of Article 2(3)”."'6

The Claimant’s position

According to the Claimant, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over all of the Claimant’s BIT claims
because Article 8(1) establishes arbitral jurisdiction over disputes “concerning an obligation of the
[Respondent] under Article 2(3)” and Article 2(3) provides that “[eJach Contracting Party shall, with
regard to the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, observe the provisions of these

specific agreements as well as the provisions of this Agreement.”

In response to the counterargument that the last sentence of Article 2(3) of the BIT cannot “extend”
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to other BIT standards, it is the plain text of the BIT which confers
jurisdiction on the Tribunal over claims arising under Article 2(3) and the Claimant does not request
any relief beyond the scope of Article 2(3).!!* The Respondent’s proposed interpretation of Article
2(3) would render inoperative the term “as well as the provisions of this Agreement” in violation of

the principle of effet utile,"

The cases cited by the Respondent were concerned with applicable law clauses, whereas Article 2(3)
is a clause setting out substantive obligations under the BIT." The cases cited by the Respondent
included claims running contrary to the plain text of the applicable treaties, which invoked provisions
of the applicable treaties “to which the respective dispute settlement provisions made no reference at
all”, whereas the Claimant “invokes nothing more than the simple words of Article 8(1) of the BIT,
conferring jurisdiction on the Tribunal for disputes concerning obligations under Article 2(3),

including the obligation to observe the BIT in addition to the specific agreement in force”.

 

The Tribunal first iders these Admissibility and Jurisdictional Objecti in Part VLA

commencing at paragraph 293 below.

FACTUAL IssuESs
1. The pre-acquisition information process
(1) The Claimant’s position

The Czech Republic provided misleading and inaccurate information about Skoda Export” by

means of the following:

(1) The Information Memorandum dated 25 September 2007, prepared by Ernst & Young,
which provided reasons for a prospective purchaser to acquire Skoda Export. The
Information Memorandum stated that Skoda Export had 23 projects as of 30 June 2007
including three projects (the “Key Projects”) which were “of considerably greater scale
and importance in terms of the company’s role and projected profits”.'"? These were: (i)
construction of the Balloki Power Plant, Pakistan, contract value CZK 3.42 billion; (ii)

construction of the Muridke Power Plant, Pakistan, contract value CZK 2.74 billion; and
(iii) construction of the Bhikki Power Plant, contract value CZK 3.11 billion.!7*

(2) The Data Room: The Data Room contained redacted copies of the original agreements
under which the Key Projects were being carried out and contained expert valuations which
placed the company’s full share value at approximately CZK 375 million and CZK 417
million respectively. Further information was added to the data room in response to
detailed questions from the FITE due diligence team,'”° which included a series of short
summary documents setting out “basic information on the contracting parties, the contract
values, the place of the projects, and the company’s expected profits” (the “Project
Cards”).!2” The Project Cards “presented Skoda Export as a well-managed company with

a portfolio of projects with total projected profits of approximately CZK 400 million”.'"*

(3) Managerial presentations: The information in the Project Cards was “confirmed” by
Skoda Export’s management in the management presentations on 29 October and 6
November 2007." During the presentation on 6 November 2007, Skoda Export’s
management made statements concerning the expected profits of the company and of the
Key Projects, which failed to disclose “substantial problems” already known to Skoda
Export at the time, including in particular that the Bhikki Project would be abandoned!”

and that the Balloki and Muridke Projects were “slated to produce substantial deficits’.'>*

The Claimant contends that it conducted a thorough due diligence on Skoda Export.'??

Department of the MoF, in October 2007.'** Instead of taking action to remove . from

Sufficient information was provided during the due diligence process.“

(1) The Information Memorandum: The Respondent asserts that the Information
Memorandum provided a balanced high-level overview of the business of Skoda Export
and described risks which were overlooked by the Claimant, including (i) that the company
operated in a specific market segment “characterized by unevenness over time and by long
delivery times”, meaning that “in individual years the financial results of the Company

dependence on outsourcing the technical design work on all of its projects to external
providers was a specific risk potentially leading to “existential endangering of the
Company”.'“° The Information Memorandum further alerted bidders to the impact of
exchange rate fluctuations on the business results of the company and presented financial
data showing exchange rate losses ranging from hundreds of millions to tens of millions of

(2) The Data Room: The Respondent emphasizes that the Data Room was open for at least 9
hours on each business day from 16 October 2007 to 12 November 2007 and from 26 to 29
November 2007.'? Referring to the complete Data Room index,'** the Respondent
contends that the documents presented in the Data Room included a full set of contractual
documentation entered into by the company in respect to each project,“ subject to the
redaction of commercially sensitive information and the consent of the counterparty to the
relevant agreement.“ In respect of the Balloki and Muridke projects, the contractual
documents available in the Data Room showed that the prices contracted with customers
“were lump sum fixed prices denominated in USD which could not be increased either as
a result of foreign exchange fluctuations during the life of the projects, or based on future
increases in the costs of inputs in the realization phase of the projects”.'“* Accordingly, it
was “fully disclosed to bidders” that the economic performance of those projects “was fully
dependent on Skoda Export’s ability to enter into back-to-back price-fixed contracts ... at

exchange exposure”,'4”

(3) Managerial presentations: The Respondent notes that the summary information provided
in the Project Cards “contained only a small fraction” of the information provided about

the projects.'*8

With respect to the Balloki project, the response to a question asked by the
bidder Skoda Holding during its management presentation “revealed that there were serious
cost overruns in the assembly and construction part of that project and that these additional
costs would burden the company, because they could not be passed on to the customer
through a price increase”.""” Accordingly, a potential investor could conclude that the
minimum cost overrun on the on-shore part could be estimated at USD 11,482,438.'% The
management of Skoda Export disclosed that finishing the Balloki and Muridke projects on
their original schedule was a problem.'*! The company’s strict financial liability under its
EPC contracts was not matched by the liability of the subcontractor, Energoprojekt.!**
Concerning other projects, the management presentations identified a number of small
projects, including the Haripur project and the project in Uganda, which despite being
originally planned as profitable were not expected to generate any profit.'*

In light of the information provided during and after the management presentations, the Respondent
contests the Claimant’s reliance on the “margin” disclosed in the Project Cards made available to
FITE.!* According to the Respondent, FITE was put on notice that to the extent any of the disclosed
tisks materialized, they would negatively affect financial performance of the Balloki and Muridke
projects.'*> In relation to the Balloki project, FITE was in possession of a presentation dated 25 April

Skoda Export it changed the company’s name to CKD Export, a.s.’” and sold the Skoda Export
trademark to a company called REINTINDEN s.r.0. (“Reintinden”) for CZK 5,000."8 Under a
licensing agreement with CKD, Skoda Export was required to pay CZK 4 million per month to FITE
for use of the CKD name and trademark.'® The CKD licensing fee was calculated in 2008 as “one
percent of the anticipated annual revenues from Skoda Export”! which was “unusually low by CKD
standards”.'°! In response to allegations made by the Respondent, the Claimant denies that the
licensing fee for use of the CKD name was a means by which Skoda Export was “saddled with
FITE’s acquisition debt” or that the sale of the Skoda Export trademark was ill-advised.'”

The Claimant particularizes certain other transactions which are alleged by the Respondent to have

been undertaken in mismanagement of Skoda Export.

(2) The Respondent’s Position

With regard to the post-acquisition management of Skoda Export, the Respondent draws attention to

certain transactions which are not mentioned in the Statement of Claim.”

In relation to the sublicensing agreement concluded by Skoda Export on 3 June 2008 with FITE
regarding use of the name Skoda Export, the Respondent alleges that the reason for the sublicensing
transaction and the amount of the sublicensing fee was the repayment of acquisition financing which
FITE had arranged to finance the purchase of the shares.°° It was a condition of the relevant loan
agreement with PPF Banka, a.s. (“PPF Bank”) that FITE would obtain the cash for the quarterly
repayments on the basis of the sublicensing agreement.” In this way, Skoda Export “was saddled
with FITE’s acquisition debt”. The sale of the Skoda Export trademark for CZK 5,000 was “at a

additional CZK 169 million in the aggregate to FITE, Sky Invest and ETAL.”* The Respondent notes

management”, Skoda Export would require substantial additional financing to continue operations.”"”
Once Skoda Export came under its control and the financial problems of Skoda Export became
knowa, it took active steps to try to turn the company around and keep it in business.?'* According
to the Claimant, the serious problems discovered by FITE after the privatisation had been known to

the MoF for a long time.?!9

Following the post-acquisition internal review, FITE “immediately undertook diligent efforts to keep
Skoda Export in business”.”° To this end, FITE took the following operational steps: (i)
implementing closer management of the company’s existing projects and strict cost-saving measures
in the company’s daily operations; (ii) fixing the currency risks on the foreign projects by setting
currency positions in accordance with CKD protocol and the recommendations of the financing bank,
HSBC Bank ple (“HSBC”); (iii) meeting with customers on the Balloki and Muridke Projects in
Pakistan, explaining Skoda Export’s possible inability to finish the projects due to cost overruns; (iv)
filing a request with the Pakistani National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (“NEPRA”) for the
upward revision of power tariffs on the Balloki and Muridke plants; (v) entering negotiations with
Pakistani customers for the possible extension of the Balloki and Muridke projects into second stages;
(vi) negotiating a price increase on the hydropower plant project in Uganda; and (vii) referring or
transferring additional projects to Skoda Export which were viable and profitable."

The projects transferred to Skoda Export included an oxygen plant in Russia (“Project MMK”); a
power plant in Russia (“Project Tatarstan”); a steel mill in Slovakia (“Project SSM”); and an
energy plant in Uzbekistan (“Project Tashkent”). Together these projects had projected cash flows

of USD 37.5 million”? According to the Claimant, these projects would not have been transferred

but for the financial problems caused by the nondisclosure of the true financial state of Skoda
Export.

FITE communicated the difficulties of Skoda Export to the MoF by: (i) a letter dated 22 September
2008, informing the MoF that it had discovered a difference of CZK 860 million between the
projected profits from the Key Projects and the post-acquisition position, inviting the Ministry to
appoint an auditor to verify its findings, and requesting the Ministry’s assistance in enabling Skoda
Export to remain in business;?”* (ii) a follow-up letter to the Ministry sent on 4 November 2008,
providing a comprehensive report on Skoda Export’s financial situation and repeating its earlier
requests; (iii) a letter to the Minister of Finance on 4 November 2008 stressing the real risk that
bank guarantees would be called and that Skoda Export would be forced into insolvency if it failed
to complete the projects it had contracted.”

In order to maintain Skoda Export’s operations, CKD decided to request financing from CEB, CEB
held a number of Skoda Export’s current accounts and had issued Skoda export with high-value
export financing guarantees in respect of the Key Projects, which were insured by EGAP.”” On 2
December 2008, CKD applied to CEB on behalf of Skoda Export for a bridge loan of CZK

1 billion.”

On 16 January 2009, Skoda Export sent a request for additional funding to Mr Ivan Fuksa, who was
both the First Deputy Minister of Finance and the Chairman of CEB’s Supervisory Board, and who
redirected the request to the CEO of CEB, Mr Lubomir Pokorny?!

Skoda Export issued a detailed request to CEB for a bridge loan on 17 April 2009.2

(2) The Respondent’s position

As to the Claimant’s “diligent efforts” to keep Skoda Export in business, the Respondent states that
none of those steps had the capacity to turn Skoda Export around.?*> Indeed, financial disbursements
were made from Skoda Export accounts to various third parties, which were not disclosed to the

financial institutions when the Claimant was seeking assistance.?*

The petitions to NEPRA of 26 January 2009 and 4 February 2009 for an increase in the tariffs for the
Balloki and Muridke projects were only filed 8 months after FITE had acquired Skoda Export,
although the problems were known from November 2007, and the Respondent notes that the outcome
of the petitions was always uncertain.”* The negotiation of future potential projects in Pakistan was
“of no benefit to the company”.? The arrangements negotiated in relation to the Uganda project
were “a continuation of the efforts underway before the privatization”."*” The additional projects
which were referred or transferred to Skoda Export, namely, Project MMK, the SSM Project and the

Tashkent Project, were all in their initial phases, imposed immediate additional financing

requirements on the company, and required dedicated teams of experts to run them, beyond the
capacity of Skoda Export2** The financial contribution of those projects was purely speculative.”
The Respondent contends that the SSM Project was not referred or transferred to Skoda Export by
CKD, but rather was internally generated by Skoda Export prior to the closing of the purchase of the

shares.“°

The terms on which the Claimant sought to secure additional financing for Skoda Export were

unreasonable.

The basis on which FITE sought assistance in its communications of 22 September 2008 and 4
November 2008 to the MoF was FITE’s calculation of the alleged loss on the individual projects
based on a comparison of the estimated business margin contained in the Project Cards and the actual
state of the projects estimated by Claimant as at August and October 2008."" In its request addressed
directly to the Minister of Finance on 4 November 2008, FITE requested the Minister to issue a state
guarantee to Skoda Export to secure a 3-year operating loan to be granted by CEB, to be repaid not
by Skoda Export but by the Czech Republic.“? On 2 December 2008, before the Ministry had
responded, Skoda Export applied to the CEB for a loan of CZK 1 billion to be secured by and
repayable through a state guarantee issued by the MoF.* On 19 December 2008,

informed the Minister of Finance that FITE had filed a claim against the Czech Republic in the Czech
courts for CZK 1.08 billion in damages and that FITE was open to an out-of-court settlement in the

form of a loan of CZK 1 billion backed by a state guarantee.”#4

parent guarantee from CKD in exchange for further financing;

increase of the EPC contracts price of the Balloki and Muridke projects, it was prepared to discuss

some form of bridge financing against appropriate security.

The CEB commissioned extraordinary audits of the Balloki and Muridke projects by SGS, an
external specialist.* The Respondent asserts that SGS was unable to deliver its regular quarterly
audits in 2008 because, after its acquisition by FITE, Skoda Export stopped providing SGS with
access to information.” In February and March 2009, SGS completed its audit and confirmed that
the Balloki and Muridke projects were only financially feasible if the accumulated cost overruns
were reflected in the EPC contract price increases. .On 3 April 2009, after meetings of its Board
of Directors and Supervisory Board, CEB informed Skoda Export of its internal decisions and the
financing that it was prepared to make available.” The Respondent denies the Claimant’s allegation
that such terms were onerous or unjustified.*** According to the Respondent, CEB already had
significant exposure to Skoda Export, whilst CKD had refused to provide any financial assistance to

Skoda Export unless the requested financial aid was provided by the Czech Republic.”

The position taken by CEB, namely, that it was prepared to provide additional financing on condition
of a guarantee by an acceptable entity from within the CKD and a mortgage over Skoda Export’s

headquarters, was reasonable. The Respondent notes that HSBC took the same position."

On several occasions, Skoda Export informed CEB that the NEPRA decisions would be

forthcoming.

149. The Respondent denies that the proposed use of the main office building of Skoda Export in
downtown Prague as security for the extended guarantees would have prevented Skoda Export from
securing the additional operating loans required to pay the company’s suppliers.“ The Respondent
points to Skoda Export’s own offers to mortgage the building; to the participation of HSBC in
communicating this requirement; and to the fact that the major part of the value of the building would

still be left to secure the additional financing?

The Freezing Orders

150. Concerns were raised when on Friday 17 April 2009, Skoda Export simultaneously filed payment
orders seeking to withdraw a total of approximately USD 7 million from four accounts with CEB
and USD 2.4 million from an account with HSBC.7 Since the accounts with CEB were pledged as
security for financing already provided, intended withdrawals would have deprived CEB of potential
cash security at a time when the guarantees provided for the Balloki project could have been called
at any time.” Given that Skoda Export had not informed CEB of the withdrawals notwithstanding

its ongoing communications, CEB had “serious concerns”.?*

151, Because of the suspicious nature of the transactions, CEB and HSBC were under an obligation to
268

report the transactions under the Anti-Money Laundering Act.’
152. The Respondent denies that it was unreasonable of the CEB and HSBC not to retract the reports of
suspicious transactions when the criminal investigation was pending.” It points out that Skoda

According to the Claimant, in direct response to the rescission of the SPA, the Czech Republic

“retaliated” by freezing Skoda Export’s bank accounts on various pretexts, as explained below.”

cash management operations, Skoda Export gave instructions for the balances on certain bank
accounts held with CEB, HSBC and Ceskoslovenské obchodni banka, as. (“CSOB”) to be

consolidated into proposed main accounts held with CEB and CSOB.”*°

Instead of giving effect to the transfers, on 22 April 2009, CEB and HSBC filed suspicious activity

of the Financial Analytical Unit, the Unit for Investigation of Corruption and Financial Crime of the
Criminal Police and Investigation Service Taxes and Money Laundering Division (the “Police
Authority”) commenced a criminal investigation into Skoda Export’s bank transfers, and issued two
resolutions (the “Freezing Orders”) that froze seven of Skoda Export’s bank accounts containing a
total of CZK 204 million.

Skoda Export fully cooperated with the Police Authority in the six weeks that followed the imposition

of the Freezing Orders, despite the severe disruption of its business.”

Skoda Export formally asked CEB on two occasions to notify the Financial Analytical Unit and
Police Authority to retract the allegations made against Skoda Export.** CEB refused to take any

District Prosecuting Attomey for Prague | (the “Prosecuting Authority”) to lift the Freezing Orders.
The Freezing Orders were lifted on 5 June 2009.78”

The Freezing Orders had a severe negative impact on Skoda Export’s business”* through the
constraints on Skoda Export’s liquidity and the reputational harm caused by news that it was under
criminal investigation.*’ According to the Claimant, the Freezing Orders were a direct cause of

Skoda Exports entry into insolvency”

The Claimant also alleges that in early 2009, during negotiations over the future of Skoda Export,
CEB attempted to divert Skoda Export’s key assets to an entity named BTG, which “had no
reputation or apparent experience in Skoda Export's field of business, but had a close relationship
with CEB and the Ministry of Finance”.”’ The attempt to have BTG take over the Key Projects from
Skoda Export continued after the insolvency proceedings had commenced, in breach of Section 111
of the Czech Insolvency Act, which prohibits transfers that have a substantial impact on the property
or assets of the debtor.” This attempt was made by CEB and its controlling authority, the MoF,
with the intention of bankrupting Skoda Export and transferring its key assets to favoured third
parties." The attempt was unsuccessful because Skoda Export’s suppliers refused to transfer their

contracts to BTG due to BTG’s inexperience in the EPC sector.”**

The Respondent allegedly engaged in a number of acts designed to undermine Skoda Export and
harass and intimidate its employees, including a police search of at Prague Airport in
April 2009; statements published in press articles by the daily newspaper Mlada Fronta Dnes; certain

e-mail communications by the CEB with Skoda Export and with third parties; and debt collection

proceedings brought on 15 June 2009 by UJV Rez, a partly state-owned subcontractor of Skoda

Export.

(2) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent alleges that the Claimant abandoned the investment through the actions it took up
to 24 April 2009, while the negotiations on financing were ongoing. These actions included (i) the
resignation on 10 April 2009 of the Supervisory Board and 3 of the 4 members of the Board of
Directors of Skoda Export; (ii) the attempt by Skoda Export to terminate the Balloki project on 22
April 2009;”.” (iii) the change of control over Skoda Export by which Skoda Export ceased to be a
member of CKD;”" (iv) the rescission of the SPA by FITE;”” and (v) the renaming of Skoda Export
as CKD Export, a.s.5

The Respondent denies that the Freezing Orders were imposed in retaliation for the rescission of the
SPA. Suspicious transaction reports were filed by HSBC and CEB on 20 April 2009, whereas the
letter from FITE rescinding the SPA was delivered subsequently, on 24 April 2009, which was on
the same day the Freezing Orders were being written by the Police Authority.*”'
According to the Respondent, following the rescission of the SPA, the financing banks continued to
attempt to find a solution that would enable the completion of the Balloki and Muridke projects. The
Respondent refers to a renewed request for additional financing made by Skoda Export on 29 May
2009, the response of CEB on 3 June 2009, and a proposal sent by CEB on 10 and 16 June 2009
concerning alternative strategies for the finalisation of the two projects.*” The proposals put forward

completed on 31 March 2011.35

(2) The Respondent’s Position

According to the Respondent, the filing of the Insolvency Petition by Siemens Engineering was
“hardly a surprise” given the failure of Skoda Export to address its overdue debts.!* The Respondent
notes that Skoda Export had a substantial amount of “past due unpaid financial obligations to its
suppliers on the Balloki and Muridke projects” and that since March 2009, before the Freezing Orders
were in place, Skoda Export had stopped making payments to its suppliers.”"

In response to the allegation of collusion between the creditors and the CEB, the Respondent states
that the dates and times referred to by the Claimant are the times of publication on the internet of the
relevant filings, and that the actual filings were made by Siemens, CEB, EnerSys, AE&E and. Skoda
Power between 18 June 2009 and 25 June 20093!

repayment and had refused to cede the projects to a third party.*!”

BIT BREACHES ALLEGED
1. Umbrella Clause
(1) The Claimant’s position

The Clamant contends that the Czech Republic breached a number of warranties, representations and
undertakings made in the SPA and breached its implied contractual obligations of good faith under

Czech law.”

Alleged breaches of the SPA

According to the Claimant, by permitting Skoda Export to lose several valuable projects during the

warranty period, the Respondent breached its obligations under the SPA.

Asset Disposal without Disclosure: Specifically, the Respondent breached its obligations under
Clauses 5.2(h), 8(h), 8.3, 10.1(c) and 10.6 of the SPA to ensure that no sale, transfer, lease or other
disposal of any other material part of Skoda Export’s assets or shareholdings occurred during the
relevant warranty period — i.e. from 31 August 2007 to 26 May 2008 — subject only to an exception
for transactions occurring in the ordinary course of the company’s business.”° Specifically, the
Respondent breached these obligations in relation to the Bhikki, Rio Turbio and NIPCCO projects,

since these projects were abandoned without providing written information to FITE.”'

The Claimant maintains that the Bhikki, Rio Turbio and NIPCCO projects were a “material part of”
the assets and participation interests of Skoda Export and rejects the Respondent’s contention that
the obligations under Clauses 5.2(h), 8.2(h) and 8.3 of the SPA do not apply to Skoda Export’s
“business cases in progress”.>”?

Disclosure of issues affecting performance of obligations: The Claimant further contends that by

failing to disclose information to FITE potentially affecting the performance of obligations under the

SPA, the Respondent breached its obligation under Clause 10.6 of the SPA to inform FITE of the
occurrence or existence of any fact that may make impossible or delay the execution of the SPA or
that may affect the validity and/or effectiveness of the SPA? One of FITE’s core obligations under
the SPA was to finish the “Business Cases in Progress”. The Respondent’s failure to disclose
updated and accurate information about ongoing “Business Cases in Progress” in relation to the
Bhikki, NIPCCO and Rio Turbio projects, misinformed FITE about the actual scope, existence and
possibility of performing its obligations under the SPA.*"> The Claimant asserts that the Respondent
had an obligation to provide accurate and correct information on the final fate of these projects, which
was not satisfied by disclosing the risks concerning these projects.>*°

Undertaking to comply with Czech laws and regulations: The Respondent breached its
obligations under Clause 5.1(c) of the SPA to comply with its obligations and duties under applicable
Czech laws and regulations, including under Acts Nos. 219/2000 Coll, 178/2005 Coll and Ministry
of Finance Directive No. 1/2006.” Contrary to the representation in Clause 5.1(c), the Claimant
maintains that the Respondent refused to make use of any available means to investigate allegations
concerning mismanagement of Skoda Export, to take steps to remedy the situation at Skoda Export
and to provide information to FITE about emerging concerns.°7*

Implied representations: According to the Claimant, the Czech Republic was obliged to abide by
“the implied representations it gave to FITE, as a necessary corollary of the warranties and
undertakings FITE gave to the MoF in relation to Skoda Export’s projects, the price FITE had agreed
to pay for Skoda Export’s shares, and as to the extent of the due diligence it had conducted as part of
the bidding process” under Recital (C) and Clauses 6.1(0), 6.1(v), 6.1(w), 9.9 and 9.10 of the SPA.22

Rulings of the Czech Courts: It is not in dispute that the Czech courts upheld the validity of the
SPA? According to the Claimant, while the Respondent asserts that the Czech courts have ruled
that “there has been no breach of the SPA,” the issues raised in the proceedings before the Czech
courts in respect of the SPA concerned different claims, based on different legal grounds, and hence
the Czech courts have not considered the arguments raised by the Claimant in these proceedings.**!
Moreover, rather than finding that FITE was not misled by the Czech Republic, as alleged by the
Respondent, the Czech courts merely concluded that the SPA could not be invalidated on account of

an error induced by the Czech Republic.>?

Alleged breaches of Czech law
@ The Act on State Property, Act No. 219/2000 Coll.

Under Section 14 of the Act on State Property, No, 219/2000 Coll (“State Property Act”), the State
is required to exercise utmost diligence in preventing damages to State property and to make use of

3

all available means in doing so? The Respondent breached this obligation in failing to take

appropriate action in response to the information provided by ~ . on 23 November 2007
concerning the mismanagement of Skoda Export by 34

The Claimant argues that even if the Respondent could not have done more than exercising its rights
as a shareholder under the Commercial Code, the Respondent “did not even attempt to use such

rights”,

(ii) Directive No. 1/2006 of the Ministry of Finance

The Respondent did not comply with its duties under Duties of Representatives of Ministry of
Finance under Directive No. 1/2006.*** Under Article 5 of Directive 1/2006, Ministry representatives
in corporate bodies are obliged to make sure that the business prospects, opportunities and risks are
properly identified, scrutinised and evaluated.*’ According to Article 5(7) of the Directive,
representatives of the Ministry in the Supervisory Board “could and should have initiated an
independent examination of the situation of Skoda Export, instead of referring back the matter to the

Board of Directors”.>*

(iti) Czech Commercial Code, Section 265

The Claimant further refers to Section 265 of the Czech Commercial Code, Act No. 513/1991 Coll?
pursuant to which the exercise of a right “that is at variance with the principles of fair business
conduct shall not be granted legal protection”. According to the Claimant, the decision to proceed
with the privatisation without sharing accurate and updated information at its disposal concerning

the actual financial status and prospects of Skoda Export “fell short of the threshold of fairness”.**!

the National Property Fund”).

Application of Article 2(3) of the BIT to the alleged breaches of the SPA and of Czech law

The alleged breaches by the Respondent of its contractual obligations towards the Claimant amount
to a violation of Article 2(3) of the BIT, according to which the Czech Republic is obliged to abide
by the provisions of contracts into which it has entered with foreign investors in respect of
investments.>*

In particular, under the SPA and related contractual instruments, the Czech Republic was obliged to:
(@ ensure that no sale, transfer, lease or other disposal of any material part of Skoda Export’s assets
or shareholdings occurred during the warranty period from 31 August 2007 to 26 May 2008, except
for transactions occurring in the ordinary course of the company’s business; and (ii) abide by “the
implied representations it gave to FITE, as a necessary corollary of the warranties and undertakings
FITE gave to the MoF in relation to Skoda Export’s projects, the price FITE had agreed to pay for
Skoda Export’s shares, and as to the extent of the due diligence it had conducted as part of the bidding
process.*#° In breach of those obligations, the Respondent (i) permitted Skoda Export to lose several
valuable projects during the warranty period and (ii) breached the implied representations it gave to
FITE in relation to the truth and accuracy of the information it had provided to FITE, by virtue of
misrepresentations in relation to the Key Projects and shortcomings in the information disclosed

during the due diligence process.“

The Respondent breached its obligations under Czech law, including in particular its obligations
under the State Property Act and Directive No. 1/2006. According to the Claimant, the Respondent
breached: (i) its obligation under the State Property Act by remaining passive and refusing to conduct

a proper audit in the face of warnings concerning financial problems at Skoda Export; (ii) its

obligations under Directive No. 1/2006 by failure of its officials delegated to the management of

Export’s assets; and (iii) its duty to act in good faith and in accordance with the requirements of fair
business conduct by withholding the truth about Skoda Export’s situation contrary to its best
knowledge.”

The violation of Article 2(3) by the aforementioned breaches of the SPA and of Czech law “triggers
the responsibility of the Czech Republic under the BIT and customary international law” and
“elevates these breaches of the SPA and Czech law to the level of international law”.°#* As a result,
the Respondent’s responsibility “entails its duty to provide compensation for WNC’s losses resulting

from this breach, as a matter of public international law”.*”?

(2) The Respondent’s position

The Respondent contends that its conduct did not breach the SPA or Czech law.

Alleged breaches of the SPA

Asset disposal without disclosure: The Respondent denies that it breached Clauses 5.2(h), 8(h), 8.3,
10.1(c) or 10.6 of the SPA by the omission to notify FITE during the bidding or contracting process
of the termination of the Rio Turbio, NIPCCO and Bhikki projects.**°

Of the relevant projects, “Rio Turbio was in the bidding stage, and the project terminated because a
competing bid was selected; NIPCCO was subject to a Memorandum of Understanding, and
terminated because it did not proceed to the contracting phase; Bhikki was subject to a contract that
was signed, but not effective, and terminated because agreement on amended price and time schedule

In particular, the Respondent maintains that Clause 5.2(h) of the SPA is inapposite because all of
these projects were “merely unconsummated business prospects”. They “were not assets in any of
the accounting sense, the legal sense under Czech law, or the general sense of the word’ and as
such were not capable of disposition.**> Further, the relevant events occurred “in the ordinary course
of business” since the company’s business was to seek to win bids and to turn winning bids into

354

effective contracts;*’ and the alleged “asset disposition” did not fulfil the materiality requirement of

Clause 5.2(h) of the SPA

As regards its obligation under Clause 8.3 to inform FITE that the Bhikki, Rio Turbio and NIPCCO
projects would not be consummated, the Respondent maintains that “sufficiently clear information
about the fact that these projects were extremely unlikely to proceed beyond the bidding stage was
made available to FITE during the due diligence process of the tender”.**

The Respondent notes that Clauses 10.1{c), 10.2 and 10.6 of the SPA are clauses regulating together
the fulfilment of conditions precedent to the closing of the SPA, and require the Seller to confirm
that all of the “Seller’s Warranties”, which are set out in Clause 5.1, are true, complete and correct
in all material aspects. The Claimant “does not allege a breach by Respondent of any of the

warranties contained in Clause 5.1 of the SPA”.>*”

Disclosure of issues affecting performance of obligations: Concerning its obligations under Clause
10.6 of the SPA, the Respondent considers that Clause 10.6 of the SPA is inapposite. First, the
obligation of FITE under Clause 6.1(v) of the SPA is not a condition precedent for the transaction
contemplated by the SPA, and does not have to do with the validity or effectiveness of the SPA as a
contract, and is consequently unrelated to Clause 10.6 of the SPA.*** Secondly, it was obvious that

any number of the cases listed as “Business Cases in Progress” might not proceed to a final contract

and execution.” Thirdly, the Respondent contends that the Claimant had failed to abide by its “core
obligations under the SPA”.2°

Undertaking to comply with Czech laws and regulations: As regards the alleged breach of Ciause
5.1(c) of the SPA, the Respondent first raises two defences in limine, namely, that (i) the temporal
dimension of Clause 5.1(c) is limited to the period between the signing and settlement dates of the
SPA; and (ii) whereas this warranty relates to the legality of Respondent having entered into the SPA
and complying with the specific obligations under the SPA itself, the Claimant neither alleges that
Respondent’s entering into the SPA would be illegal, nor that any one of Respondent’s obligations
in the SPA, if observed, would be illegal. 2!

Even if Clause 5.1(c) did apply to the allegations regarding the MoF’s reaction to the letter from

concerning , the Respondent maintains that its response to that letter was
entirely appropriate in the circumstances and that the Claimant does not explain how its own
suggested approach would have been superior to the response of the MoF, in which

himself was instrumental.°

 

Implied repr i Concerning the “implied rep ” allegedly given to FITE, the
Respondent points to the Parties’ agreement at Clause 5.3 of the SPA that the representations and
warranties contained in the SPA are the sole representations and warranties made by the Czech
Republic to FITE and the warranty by FITE at Clause 6.1(n) of the SPA that it had not relied on any
other warranties except for those explicitly made by the Czech Republic in the SPA2* The
Respondent asserts that the Claimant’s claims based on alleged additional “implied” warranties

“amounts to nothing else than a retroactive attempt to change the terms of the transaction”.

towards the state as its shareholder or vice-versa, nor did it derogate from any of the provisions of

the Commercial Code.*”*

Concerning the regulation of the corporate affairs of Skoda Export as a joint stock company, the
Respondent emphasizes that the applicable law is found in the Commercial Code of the Czech
Republic and the Articles of Association of Skoda Export. These exhaustively list the rights of the
Czech Republic as a shareholder in Skoda Export, as well as the responsibilities of the members of

the individual corporate bodies of the company in their dealings with the company and with third

 

parties, including company shareholders.”* The C ial Code inter alia the
limitations on the extent to which a shareholder is entitled to receive information about the business

affairs of the company.?””

(ii) Directive No. 1/2006 of the Ministry of Finance

Concerning MoF Directive No. 1/2006, the Respondent notes that this is an internal document of the
MoF, which could not change the generally applicable legislation. The Respondent contends that
there was no breach of Directive No. 1/2006. *”*

According to the Respondent, Directive No. 1/2006 provides that the MoF could unilaterally instruct
corporate bodies where it exercised shareholder control, or their members, regarding matters of
privatization only on the basis of a specific agreement on the exercise of corporate control entered
into between the MoF and the relevant controlled company. No such agreement had been concluded

between the Czech Republic and Skoda Export”

prepared in respect of Skoda Export was consistent with the requirements of this Act2*° The
Respondent notes, further, that the Act on Cancellation of the National Property Fund, Act No.
178/2005 Coll, cited by the Claimant, does not impose any specific or additional obligations on the
State.**!

Application of Article 2(3) of the BIT to the alleged breaches of the SPA and of Czech law

The Respondent objects that the alleged breaches of Czech law and of the SPA are not covered by
Article 2(3) of the BIT, and that the Tribunal accordingly lacks jurisdiction over such alleged

breaches.

But even if the Tribunal were to uphold its jurisdiction over the alleged breaches of the SPA or Czech
law on the basis that the SPA was a “specific agreement” under Article 2(3) of the BIT, the Claimant
“would still need to demonstrate that those obligations had been breached and would have to do so
under the law that creates and sustains them, i.e. Czech law”.*? According to the Respondent, as a
matter of Czech law, the SPA has not been breached, nor is there any plausible basis for alleging it

to have been breached.***

The Respondent contends, further, that the Claimant’s claims would not be admissible because the
Parties to the SPA have explicitly agreed on the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts in

Prague, and moreover those courts have determined that no commitments pursuant to the SPA were

enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of investors of the other Contracting Party.”

The Respondent treated the Claimants investment reasonably and in anon-discriminatory manner.
Specifically, in response to the allegation that high-ranking officials conducted a “personal vendetta”
against , the Respondent considers that this is a “conspiracy theory” which is implausible

and has nothing to do with the rule of law or with any wilful disregard of due process.“*

Noting that discrimination may be measured generally when similarly situated foreign investors in
the same economic sector are treated differently without reasonable justification, the Respondent
contends that the only discrimination allegations made by the Claimant in this case, namely, that
CEB’s treatment of Skoda Export’s requests for the extension of guarantees and additional credit for
the Balloki and Muridke projects in 2009 differed sharply from its treatment of other credit

applicants, “has not been pleaded with respect to this claim” and is unrelated to it?

The Respondent contends that it has not “impair[ed] the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment
or disposal” of the Claimant’s investment, and that the Claimant has not made any specific assertions
in this regard.“ The Claimant has not made out a claim under the specific terms of Article 2(2) of

acclaim cannot be made under the general requirement of FET.*?”

Claimant in relation to the i of a ility and tr is the award

transparency, but rather that the behaviour of the Respondent was outside the scope of this

framework, and its allegation in this respect is unfounded.

3. Expropriation
(1) The Claimant’s position

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent unlawfully expropriated its investment in breach of Article
5 of the BIT because (i) CEB and EGAP failed to provide critically needed financing for Skoda
Export’s projects;** (ii) CEB and EGAP attempted to divert Skoda Export’s projects to a third party
contractor; and (iii) CEB acted to freeze Skoda Export’s bank accounts on false and

unsubstantiated charges.*” On the basis of these acts and omissions, the Claimant contends that the

Czech Republic’s unlawful expropriation engages its responsibility at international law."**

The expropriation was unlawful because it did not meet the requirements of (i) just compensation,
(ii) due process and observance of law, (iii) non-discrimination, and (iv) public interest.4°’ The

was rendered unlawful by the failure to pay compensation.*”?

Additionally, in the alternative to its claim under Article 2(3) of the BIT, the Claimant contends that
“the entirety of the Czech Republic’s acts in this case substantiate a case for expropriation under
Article $ of the BIT”.“°

The Claimant responds as follows to the defences raised by the Respondent.

Attribution of ibility to the Czech Republic for the conduct of CEB and EGAP

The Claimant maintains that the conduct of the CEB and EGAP is attributable to the Respondent
under international law, pursuant to Article 5 of the ILC Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States
for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ILC Articles”), since CEB and EGAP are instruments of the

state charged with performing governmental functions.“!

The Claimant asserts that CEB and EGAP have a primary role in implementing governmental export
policies; perform state functions conferred on them by legislation; are publicly accountable for their
conduct; conceive themselves as being State entities charged with providing State support; are owned
and controlled by the State, with supervisory bodies consisting of State officials; and receive

extensive support from the State budget and have their losses covered by fiscal resources.“

The Claimant points out that the mission of the CEB is conferred on it by Czech law under the
Financing of Exports Act; that the Act requires the State to retain its majority ownership in CEB and
exclusive control of CEB.“ The governmental function of the CEB is confirmed by the fact that it

is subject to the scrutiny of the State Audit Office and that it is designated as an instrumentality in

charge of implementing the State’s export strategy by the official “Export Policy” of the Czech
Republic between 2006 and 2010 (the “Export Policy”).

The Claimant contends that EGAP, alongside CEB, is empowered by Czech law to exercise elements
of governmental authority in the implementation of the foreign trade policy of the Czech Republic
and is subject to the audit of the State Audit Office.“* Its funds for export credit risk are subsidized
from the State budget.”

The implementation of State policy by State entities qualifies as the exercise of governmental policy
under the first element of Article 5 of the ILC Articles, citing numerous arbitral decisions to this

effect.447

The Claimant maintains that CEB and EGAP acted within the scope of their governmental authority
in their conduct towards the Claimant’s investment in violation of the BIT.““* The support received
by Skoda Export from CEB and EGAP prior to its privatization was a “dominant factor” in its
decision to turn to CEB and EGAP for financial assistance once the post-acquisition audit revealed
the poor condition of the company.” The letters from the Minister and Deputy Minister of Finance
confirm that Skoda Export’s relationship with CEB and EGAP fell within the ambit of their
governmental mandate because when FITE approached the Ministry for assistance, the Ministry
directed FITE to approach CEB and EGAP.*” According to the Claimant, the fact that FITE also
submitted credit applications to other institutions is irrelevant, since those entities did not provide

Skoda Export with the requisite financial support.**!

The Claimant asserts that CEB’s support for BTG fell within the scope of its public functions since
the Balloki project was a top priority of CEB, and was discriminatory vis-a-vis Skoda Export.

Whether the Freezing Orders ituted a legiti exercise of police powers

In response to the defence raised by Respondent, the Claimant denies that the Freezing Orders
constituted a legitimate exercise of police powers under international law.“? The Claimant
acknowledges the Respondent’s right to regulate and exercise its police power in the interests of
public welfare.“ It contends that “the record shows that CEB acted to freeze Skoda Export’s bank
accounts on false and unsubstantiated charges” as evidenced by the finding of the Prosecuting
Authority that the suspicious transaction reports were baseless and unwarranted and that CEB was

aware of the negative impact that the Freezing Orders would have.‘

The Claimant maintains that the Respondent, through CEB, exercised its regulatory powers in bad
faith, for a non-public purpose, and in a fashion that was both discriminatory and lacking in

proportionality between the public purpose and the actions taken.’**

Whether the alleged conduct of the R was the cause of Skoda Export’s insolvenc’

According to the Claimant, Skoda Export’s insolvency was a direct and proximate cause of the

Respondent’s unlawful conduct.**”

The Claimant denies that its own conduct in managing the business of Skoda Export was the cause
of the company’s financial difficulties, referring to its own “diligent” efforts to keep Skoda Export

in business."*

The Claimant maintains that the terms on which CEB offered financing to Skoda Export were
commercially unreasonable; CEB treated Skoda Export’s management disparagingly during
meetings with customers on the Key Projects; and CEB gave preferential treatment to other credit

applicants that presumably had connections with the Czech government.*®?

The Claimant denies that CEB “proposed” the transfer of the problematic projects in a bona fide
attempt to avert the insolvency of Skoda Export. Rather, Mr Pokorny “demanded” the transfer of
the Key Projects to BTG, an “untrustworthy” operator which lacked the necessary experience to
complete the projects.“ CEB conducted meetings with customers and suppliers in a “surreptitious
and underhanded” manner, and attempted to “strong-arm” Skoda Export’s management into

transferring the projects in a short period of time and under threat of death.4

(2) The Respondent’s position

The Respondent denies that it has breached Article 5 of the BIT on the grounds that (i) the conduct
of the CEB and EGAP is not attributable to the Respondent under international law; (ii) even if such
conduct were attributable to the Respondent, the challenged conduct constituted a legitimate exercise
of police powers under international law; and (iii) Skoda Export’s insolvency was not caused by the
Czech Republic.*

Attribution of responsibility to the Czech Republi¢ for the conduct of CEB and EGAP

According to the Respondent, none of the alleged conduct of CEB and EGAP is attributable to the
Czech Republic, on the basis of Articles 4, 5, or 8 of the ILC Articles or otherwise."

in the exercise of such governmental authority.‘

In relation to the “elements of governmental authority” under Article 5 of the ILC Articles, of which
examples include the ability to regulate, license, and impose penalties, the Respondent contends that
“mere ownership of shares in a corporation plays no role in the determination of whether an entity
exercises elements of governmental authority or not”.*”! Neither CEB nor EGAP regulates the
financing of export, provides their clients with any special prerogatives, licenses or permits, or

imposes penalties except for contractual penalties.‘

The activities of export financing and the
insurance of export risks are business activities which may be performed by commercial entities.4
The only public element of CEB and EGAP is their entitlement to receive state support in connection

with the provision of their financial and insurance services.4

Neither the alleged failure to provide financing, the alleged attempt to divert Skoda Export projects
to a third party, nor the actions taken to freeze Skoda Export’s bank accounts carried “even a trace”
of governmental authority.’ Any bank would have been in a position to take such actions in such a
situation, as in fact HSBC did in relation to the financing decisions and reporting of suspicious
transactions.‘

The Respondent further denies that CEB or EGAP are empowered to exercise governmental authority
on the ground that each is charged with implementing State policy under the Financing of Exports
Act? The fact that commercial activities further State policy goals does not change their
fundamentally private character.**? In addition to citing jurisprudence in support of its position, the

The Respondent emphasizes that all commercial banks have a duty under EU and Czech law to report
suspicions of improper transactions aimed at money laundering, asset draining, or other actions,">
and given that HSBC acted identically to CEB in reporting the “unusual and commercially irrational”
transfer instructions received from Skoda Export on 17 April 2009, “the bright line rule from
international law” to the effect that activity of a commercial nature can never be considered an

exercise of governmental authority “is conclusive”.*™*

Whether the Freezing Orders constituted a legiti exercise of police powers

The Respondent contends that if the challenged conduct were attributable to the Czech Republic,

such conduct constituted a legitimate exercise of police powers under international law.’**

The Respondent emphasizes that the burden of proving that the actions allegedly constituting
expropriation were not a legitimate exercise of police powers because they were disproportionate,
discriminatory, or in bad faith, falls on the Claimant.“ The Respondent responds to the two
allegations made by Claimant in purporting to show that the suspicious activity reports and Freezing
Orders were not legitimate exercises of police power, namely, the finding by the Prosecuting
Authority that the reports were “baseless and unwarranted”; and the allegedly disproportionate nature

of the CEB’s response in failing first to raise its suspicions directly with Skoda Export.

According to the Respondent, the suspicious activity reports and the subsequent Freezing Orders
were made in good faith fulfilment of legal obligations, under the Anti-Money Laundering Act and

EU mandatory law, designed to prevent financial crimes.”

The Respondent notes that a payment
can be suspicious without being illegal, and the Prosecuting Authority made no finding of bad

faith.“** Concerning the alleged failure to communicate beforehand with Skoda Export, the

Respondent notes that CEB was “legally obliged” not to report its suspicions to Skoda Export since

this would undermine the purpose of the Anti-Money Laundering Act.‘

The Respondent asserts that the Claimant has put forward no evidence or allegation that the failure
to provide Skoda Export with additional financing and the proposed transfer of the Balloki and
Muridke projects were anything other than legitimate exercises of police powers.*” The Respondent
notes that the decisions on the relevant credit applications were made on the basis of a risk assessment
of the transaction in question, and the proposal to transfer those projects to a third party was part of
a good faith attempt to find terms on which the projects could be completed and Skoda Export could

be disburdened from the obligations it had incurred.**'

Respondent denies that the insolvency of Skoda Export was caused by the failure to provide
financing, the alleged harm to Skoda Export’s relationship with its customers and sub-contractors,

The Respondent’s position is that the financial difficulties experienced by Skoda Export were caused
by the Claimant’s own conduct in managing the business of the company, including in particular its
refusal to accept financing on the terms offered by CEB and its refusal to accept transfer of the loss-

making projects to a third-party EPC contractor.**

payments to its creditors after the Freezing Orders were lifted.5°*

Concerning the transfer of projects to a third party, the Respondent observes that the Claimant has
“failed to explain why getting rid of defaulted and underfunded projects and the obligations
associated with them would cause Skoda Export’s insolvency”.

The failure to provide financing did not constitute an expropriatory measure because no risk-
conscious creditor would have provided financing, given the dire financial condition of Skoda
Export, without requiring changes that would have restored its minimal financial viability such as
the transfer of the Balloki and Muridke projects, or requiring security for additional credit. By
tefusing to accept such measures when they were proposed, the Claimant effectively declined to

accept credit that was potentially available to it.5°7

The Respondent adds that failure to provide assistance which would have been contrary to EU state
aid law to a company in difficulty cannot constitute an expropriatory measure or every single
bankruptcy of a company would constitute expropriation and every collapse of a foreign-owned

company could result in a BIT claim.**

The Respondent distinguishes the investment BIT award relied upon by the Claimant, Eureko v.
Poland, on the grounds that in that case, the state had created a legitimate expectation that it would
act and did not do so, whereas in the present case the Claimant had no legitimate expectation to the

additional financing it had requested on non-commercial terms from CEB.°?

DAMAGES AND QUANTUM.
L Quantum of damages
(1) The Claimant’s position

The measure of damages claimed by the Claimant in the first instance (“Primary Damages Claim”)
is based on a comparison “between the actual cash flows realized by Skoda Export and the cash flows
it would have realised “but for” the Respondent’s wrongful conduct?!” The damages calculated by
the Claimant in respect of this claim consist of (i) the expected income from Skoda Export’s current
and potential projects as represented to WNC during the privatization process, and (ii) lost profits

from the additional projects that WNC arranged for Skoda Export to obtain after acquisition.*"!

In the alternative, to the extent the Tribunal is minded to use the purchase price as a measure of the
compensation due to the Claimant under Article 2(3) of the BIT, the Claimant claims the purchase
price of the shares together with the value of the Transferred Projects (“Alternative Damages
Claim”).°”?

In respect of its Primary Damages Claim, the Claimant claims that it is entitled to the reasonably
expected value of Skoda Export’s existing and potential projects, plus the value of the Transferred
Projects and Skoda Export’s real estate, so as to calculate the full value that the Claimant expected
to realise from the acquisition of Skoda Export, subject to a discount reflecting the probability that
the Claimant might not have won the bid.” The value of Skoda Export as reasonably expected by
the Claimant is calculated by applying a DCF analysis to each of Skoda Export’s projects as
represented to the Claimant during privatisation, using the project-specific information available

supplemented by “reasonable assumptions” based on standard EPC practice.'"

In respect of its Alternative Damages Claim, the Claimant contends that the purchase price must be
subject to a reasonable interest rate to reflect the time value of the funds; and the Claimant must be
compensated for the lost value of the projects that it transferred to Skoda Export, the value of which

was “destroyed in its entirety” by the refusal of financing and the Freezing Orders."

In response to the Respondent’s critique of its damages methodology, the Claimant asserts that the
Respondent and its expert have failed to recognise the underlying principles of the Claimant’s
calculations. The Second FTI Report “makes clear that the applied method is the acceptable method
of comparing the cash flows of Skoda Export’s projects “but for” the wrongful conduct of the

Respondent with the actual cash flow”.*!®

In response to the allegation that Claimant’s damages calculations constitute “a calculation of a risk-
free business with guaranteed cash flows” the Claimant notes that the authors of the Second FTL
Report recognize and address the risks associated with the expected cash flows of the projects, and
“consider that the expected cash flows of the projects are net of reserves for the risk of realization
and reasonably represent the cash flows that the Claimant would have generated in the absence of

the Measures”.°!”

The Claimant quantifies its primary damages claim as follows:*"*

(1) _ the value of Skoda Export’s Existing Projects, which the FTI Report has stated as USD
8,321,952;

(2) _ the value of Skoda Export’s Potential Projects, which the FTI Report has stated as USD
3,365,812;

(3) _ the value of the Transferred Projects, which the FTI Report has valued at USD 23,952,551;

(1) _ the purchase price for Skoda Export which based on the exchange rate of the time the FTI
Report has determined to be USD 13,020,297; and

(2) _ the value of Skoda Export’s Transferred Projects, which the FTI Report has valued at USD
23,952,551.

The Claimant’s primary damages claim amounts to USD 71,581,414. The Claimant’s alternative
damages claim amounts to USD 46,898, 664.°2°

(2)The Respondent’s position

The Respondent’s position is that no damages can be awarded to the Claimant since the Respondent
did not violate any provision of the BIT, Czech law, the SPA or any “specific agreement” alleged by
the Claimant, and the losses allegedly incurred by the Claimant were not caused by actions or
inactions for which the Respondent is responsible.”

In the event of a finding by the Tribunal that the Claimant is entitled to damages, the Respondent
maintains that the Claimant has not proved any damage from the purported violations of the Umbrella
Clause or the BIT provisions on FET or unreasonable and discriminatory measures.” In the
alternative, the Respondent asserts that any compensation for violation of the Umbrella Clause must
be calculated in accordance with the amount agreed in the SPA. At the time when the SPA was
signed, Section 386(1) of the Czech Commercial Code prohibited only a total exclusion of damage

liability, but not its limitation.°*

As to the calculation of the damages claimed by the Claimant, the Respondent asserts that the
Claimant’s alternative claims in the amounts of USD 90,000,000 and 65,000,000 are not backed by

any evidence.>°

The Respondent challenges the quantification of the amounts based on the report of Messrs Rosen
and Mizrahi, contending that the 20 general assumptions adopted in the FTI Report, if inapplicable,

526

can lead to a material change in the results of the valuation.““° According to the Respondent, the vast

527

majority of the assumptions made in the FTI Report are unsustainable,”*’ including for instance

assumptions regarding the projected profit margins applicable to each project and how such profit
margins compare with those realised by other EPC contractors.

According to the Respondent, in estimating the damages allegedly sustained by the Claimant, the
authors of the FTI Report “did not apply any commonly recognized method of valuing a business”
and specifically “did not apply a discounted cash flow (DCF) method” despite the Claimant having
referred to the DCF method as the appropriate method of quantification of damages.*”? The
Respondent characterizes the valuation in the FTI Report as “a valuation of a risk-free business with
guaranteed cash flows” since it applies a zero discount rate to Existing Projects and Transferred

Projects.**°

According to Dr David Dearman, to calculate the value of the company “but for” the alleged
misrepresentations, the Claimant should have (i) made a best ex ante reliable cash flow forecast from

all of the evidence available in the Data Room, not just the Project Cards; (ii) applied a discount rate

to reflect the risk of these cash flows; and (iii) added to the resulting valuation the value of any excess

assets, i.e, assets which Skoda Export did not need to run its business.”**!

The Respondent asserts that the “future losses” claimed by the Claimant are speculative, uncertain,
and hypothetical, by reason of the selection of the value of Skoda Export’s real estate as a proxy
measure of future loss, which rests on the “inherently speculative” assumption that Skoda Export
was going to be carried out on a profitable or break-even basis.**? Such losses are not recoverable
pursuant to the settled principle of international law according to which only those damages that can

be reasonably ascertained can be recovered.**

The Respondent contends that the primary calculation of damages made by FTI is fundamentally
flawed. First, FTI does not quantify loss to the Claimant because it does not quantify the value of
Skoda Export but instead merely quantifies Skoda Export’s cash flows, and even assuming cash
flows were an appropriate measure of value, “they could only be so to the extent they were lost by
Claimant, not Skoda Export”, and any loss to the Claimant should be measured by the cash that would
ultimately flowed up to the Claimant by way of dividends payable by Skoda Export. ** The value
of any sums payable up to the Claimant as dividends would need to be calculated taking into account
central office overheads, which the FTI Reports fail to take into account.** Further, should the
Claimant be correct in its allegation that the data on the Project Cards turned out to be misleading or
false, “this would necessarily mean that those Project Cards cannot represent profits or cash flows
that Skoda Export could have earned and therefore cannot represent Claimant’s losses”.°* Finally,
the calculation is flawed because the value of Skoda Export’s real estate is overstated and only that

part of the premises which was not occupied by Skoda Export itself, amounting to 13 percent of the

own losses, the Respondent contends that any damages awarded to the Claimant must be

appropriately reduced to reflect the Claimant's contribution to its loss, in the Tribunal’s discretion.*"*

3. Interest
(1) The Claimant’s position

The Claimant claims pre-award interest and asserts that “the applicable statutory interest, which
comes into effect as at the date a demand for damages is made, is 8 percent plus the repo rate set by
the Czech National Bank for the first day of the calendar half-year in which the default occurred”,
which currently stands at 8.05 percent.“ The Claimant contends that the same rate should apply

after the rendering of the Tribunal’s award.***

(2) The Respondent’s position

According to the Respondent, the interest claimed by the Claimant is unreasonable. The Claimant
claims pre-award interest at “the risk free rate of US Treasury bills plus a premium of 3 percent”
whereas the Respondent contends that the appropriate standard is the interest rate payable on the loan
FITE obtained from PPF Bank to acquire Skoda Export, namely, “3 month PROBOR plus 1.69%”.54*

With regard to post-award interest, the Respondent contends that the Claimant misinterprets Czech
law by a defective translation of Regulation No. 351/2013 Coll. (“Regulation 351”). Regulation 351
sets out not “statutory interest” as contended by Claimant, but “default interest”. The rate of statutory
interest is found in Section 1802 of the Czech Civil Code, which refers to the “interest required on
loans provided by banks in the place of residence or seat of the debtor at the time of entering into a
contract”.“7 The Respondent contends that the purpose of the BIT would not be served by the

application of the default rate established by Regulation 351, which is concerned with sanctions

would constitute Respondent’s debt towards the Claimant, it would be “fundamentally unfair” to
apply the interest rate of 8.05 percent as requested by the Claimant, and the proper post-award interest

rate is nil.”

Alternatively, the rate of post-award interest should not be higher than Claimant’s own cost of funds,
which the Respondent calculates at 1.98 percent per annum, based on the interest rate offered by PPF
Bank at the time of the loan agreement dated 24 April 2009, 3 month PRIBOR (currently 0.29

percent) plus 1.69 percent per annum.**

JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

As apreliminary observation, it is to be recalled that jurisdiction arising under a BIT is conferred and
defined by the terms of that treaty. Where jurisdictional objections arise from disputed facts (for
example whether there has been an “investment”), the onus is upon the Claimant to establish those
facts. However, where, as here, the objections arise from the construction of specific provisions of
the BIT, the Tribunal must apply the principles of interpretation reflected in the Vienna Convention
on the Law of Treaties (“WCLT”). Issues of onus do not come into play and the process of

interpretation engaged in by the Tribunal! determines the result.

1 The intra-EU BIT jurisdictional objection

The Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis that the BIT has been superseded.
by EU law.** It contends that the BIT has been terminated pursuant to Article 59(1) of the VCLT.
Alternatively, it is not applicable to the present case under Article 30(3) of the VCLT. The objection

has two limbs.

Limb (1): The Respondent says that EU law has the same subject matter as the BIT because it
provides protection to investors from one Member State in connection with investing in another
Member State. The Respondent points to laws which guarantee freedom of movement of capital and
freedom of establishment, as well as investors’ access to the courts of EU Member States.°**
Second, the rights and protections in the BIT are only available to investors from the UK and the
Czech Republic. The Respondent contends that the BIT consequently discriminates on grounds of
nationality against investors from other EU States, contrary to rules laid down in the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”).** In light of the subject matter overlap and the

incompatibility of the laws, and given the BIT is the earlier instrument, the Respondent says that the

BIT should be considered terminated under VCLT Article 59(1).°°” Alternatively, it says that under
VCLT Article 30(3) the BIT cannot be applied in the present case.>**

The Tribunal makes the preliminary observation that the Respondent’s objection is not clearly
pleaded in its Statement of Defence. The Respondent refers to the VCLT’s rules in footnotes and
does not explain how its arguments relate to or satisfy the elements of those rules. The Respondent
also advances its case under both the subjective and objective elements in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b)
to Article 59(1), when only the latter is open to it on its pleaded case. These defects are not remedied
in its Rejoinder. Notwithstanding this, the Tribunal takes the first limb of the Respondent’s argument
to be directed towards the ‘sameness’ criterion in Articles 59(1) and 30(1) of the VCLT (i.e., that the
treaties share the same subject matter), whilst the second limb is directed towards the criterion of
incompatibility between the treaties in Articles 59(1)(b) and 30(3). Viewed in this way, any

29559

“confusion or conflation between sameness and incompatibility’ can be overcome and the

Tribunal can proceed to determine the objection.

The grounds advanced by the Respondent in support of its objection have been considered and
consistently rejected by a number of arbitral tribunals. The Respondent acknowledges this," but
calls on the Tribunal to disregard these decisions on the grounds that they “have either applied EU
law incorrectly, or are incomplete and irrelevant”.**! The Respondent also relies on recent public

362

statements made by the EC that intra-EU BITs have been superseded by EU law;*” it also refers to

enforcement action taken by the EC against EU Member States in this area.

Arbitral tribunals have consistently held that EU law and BITs do not have the same subject matter
on the basis that EU law does not offer equivalent procedural or substantive protections to foreign

investors. Tribunals have been particularly persuaded by the fact that EU law does not provide

investors with a right to institute an arbitration against a host state. For instance, in Eastern Sugar v.
Czech Republic it was decided that:

The BIT also provides for a special procedural protection in the form of arbitration
between the investor state and the host state and, especially arbitration of a “mixed” or
“diagonal” type between the investor and the host state, as in the present case...From
the point of view of the promotion and protection of investments, the arbitration clause
is in practice the most essential provision of Bilateral Investment Treaties. ... EU law
does not provide such a guarantee.

The tribunal in Rupert Binder v. Czech Republic reached the same conclusion, holding that “investor-
state arbitration is not addressed by EC law, and the EC legal order has not offered a substitute for
investor-state arbitration”.“*

The Respondent argues that EU law protects foreign investment by providing investors access to
Member State courts.** But in many cases suits in municipal courts under EU law do not offer the
same advantages as independent arbitration under an investment BIT. This issue was considered in
Eureko B.V. v. Slovakia in relation to the claimant’s right to arbitrate under the BIT between the
Netherlands and Czechoslovakia. The tribunal held that:

Such a consensual arbitration under well-established arbitration rules adopted by the
United Nations, in a neutral place and with a neutral appointing authority, cannot be
equated simply with the legal right to bring legal proceedings before the national courts
of the host state; and, moreover, the locus standi of an investor under the BIT, with its
broad definition of “indirect” investments under Article 1, is unlikely to be replicated
under the court procedures of an EU Member State.°

The situation is no different in the present case under Article 8(2) of the BIT, which provides inter
alia for arbitration by an ad hoc tribunal under the UNCITRAL Rules

Tribunals have also concluded that the substantive protections offered to investors in investment
treaties are not available under EU law. In Eastern Sugar, it was resolved that the right to move
capital in and out of different jurisdictions within the EU, and to invest in a host state with the same
rights and entitlements as a local investor, are not co-ordinate with the right to FET and the
prohibition on expropriation.>*” In Zureko it was accepted that “it is at least arguable that there is a
duplication of rights to free movement of capital, which exist both under the BIT and under EU
law.”5° However, in that case the tribunal was comparing a right to free transfer of profits and
dividends under the BIT with the right to free movement of capital under EU law. In the present suit,
the Claimant does not rely on an equivalent protection under the BIT (such as Article 6, which
provides for repatriation of investment and returns) and so the juxtaposition of these two protections

need not be made.

In Eureko, the tribunal considered whether freedom of establishment under EU law was co-ordinate

with protection from expropriation. It stated that:

Similarly, the protection in Article 5 of the BIT against expropriation is by no means
covered by the EU freedom of establishment. While it certainly overlaps with the right
to property secured by Article 17 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (and the
First Protocol to the ECHR, as applied under EU law), the BIT provision on
expropriation is not obviously co-extensive with it. Both the considerable body of
jurisprudence on indirect takings that has emerged in the context of BITs, and also the
fact that the BIT protects “assets” and “investments” rather than the arguably narrower
concepts of “possessions” and “property” protected by the EU Charter on Fundamental
Rights, give rise to the possibility of wider protection under the BIT than is enjoyed
under EU law.”

Consistently with these BIT authorities, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondent’s contention

that freedom of establishment is co-ordinate with protection from expropriation.

The Respondent challenges the Eastern Sugar, EURAM and Eureko awards and argues that the
Tribunal should not have regard to those decisions because they applied EU law incorrectly or are

incomplete and irrelevant.

The Respondent argues that the tribunal in Eastern Sugar incorrectly states that EU law does not
offer protection during the time in which an investment is in place in a host state.°” In doing so,
however, it mischaracterises a statement made by the tribunal in the context of the right to free

movement of capital and not EU law in general. The tribunal stated as follows:

The European Union guarantees the free movement of capital. Thus, it guarantees to
non-Czech investors from other EU member countries the right to invest in the Czech
Republic on a par with any Czech investor. .., Similarly, the European Union guarantees
the free movement of capital outwards, thus, the investor may take out profits and even
the investment as such out of the host country. By contrast, the BIT provides for fair
and equitable treatment of the investor during the investor's investment in the host
country, prohibits expropriation, and guarantees full protection and security and the like.

The Eastern Sugar tribunal’s comparison of the free movement of capital with BIT protections is
brief, but its distinction between capital inflows and outflows on the one hand, and the treatment
afforded to investments whilst operating in situ is apposite. Indeed this distinction is enlivened in
the present case, where the Claimant seeks to rely on the FET standard both with respect to the
acquisition of Skoda Export and its treatment by CEB. While free movement of capital might
complement the FET standard in respect to the acquisition, it is difficult to see how it could be
invoked with respect to the treatment of FITE or Skoda Export (as domestically incorporated
companies) by a Czech bank. On this basis, the Respondent’s arguments with respect to Eastern

Sugar must be rejected.

The Respondent condemns the EURAM award because the tribunal “fundamentally misunderstood
EU law”.®”! Yet one need only look at the extract of the award presented by the Respondent to
appreciate that — whether or not it was accurate as a matter of law — the tribunal’s statement was not
determinative of its finding on the intra-EU jurisdictional objection in that case. The extract begins

with “The Tribunal wishes to add that...”; viewed in its context, the extracted paragraph follows a

substantive analysis by the Tribunal in which it evaluates the different subject matter of EU law and

the BIT. Again, the Tribunal is not persuaded to reject the reasoning in EURAM.

Finally, the Respondent contends that the findings in Zureko are not applicable because it considered
BU law “before the Lisbon Treaty came into force, amending the EU Treaty and the EC Treaty (now
the TFEU).”*” Yet the Respondent does not explain how developments in EU law following the
entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty align the subject matter of EU law with that contained in the
BIT. For instance, one of the reasons the inter-EU jurisdictional objection was rejected in Eureko
was because EU law contained no equivalent of the arbitration clause in the BIT. The Lisbon Treaty
(and other subsequent EU law) has not changed this fact, and, on this basis, the legal framework

considered by the tribunal in 2008 does not seem materially different to that in place today.

It follows that the Respondent has not established that EU law relates to the same subject matter of
BIT under Articles 59(1) or 30 of the VCLT. Accordingly, the first limb of its jurisdictional objection

must fail.

Limb (2): The second limb of the Respondent’s EU law objection, under Articles 59(1)(b) and 30(3)
of the VCLT, likewise fails. It is argued that there is an incompatibility between EU law and the
BIT. But the BIT does not discriminate on the grounds of nationality against EU investors from third
states, The fact that the BIT affords certain rights not available to other EU investors does not make
the BIT discriminatory; there is nothing in the BIT that prevents investors of other states claiming
equal rights under the BIT. It also does not bar investors of non-party states from accessing

commensurate protections under EU law. As the tribunal observed in Eastern Sugar:

If the EU Treaty gives more rights than does the BIT, then all EU parties, including the
Netherlands and Dutch investors, may claim those rights. If the BIT gives rights to the
Netherlands and to Dutch investors that it does not give other EU countries and
investors, it will be for those other countries and investors to claim their equal rights,
But the fact that these rights are unequal does not make them incompatible.°”

For these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s argument about the effect of EU law on

jurisdiction under the BIT. As already noted, a number of investor-State tribunals have considered

the question of intra-EU BIT’ and to date they have all concluded that the intra-EU BIT before them
has legal force and effect. There is no principle of binding precedent in international law. Each
case must be decided on its own merits and each tribunal must consider the case before it as pleaded
by the disputing parties. Nonetheless, to the extent that they are based on sound legal reasoning, the
decisions of tribunals in prior international law cases can provide useful insights to subsequent

tribunals considering those issues.

Of course EU law was modified by the Treaty of Lisbon, and the EC has been developing its views
of the legal questions involved with intra-EU investment treaties; the European Court of Justice has
also expressed views about related questions of competence and wil! no doubt define its position
more precisely in due course, The Tribunal recognizes that a different view may eventually prevail.
However, this Tribunal is obligated under the BIT to decide this case based on the consent of the
States parties as set out in the text of the BIT, and on the arguments presented by the Parties. This it
has done.

2. Jurisdiction in respect of the SPA under the Umbrella Clause Article 2(3)

The Respondent’s second jurisdictional objection relates to the SPA between FITE and the Czech
Republic for the acquisition of Skoda Export. The Respondent contends that the Umbrella Clause in
the BIT (Article 2(3)) does not apply to the SPA because the SPA is not an agreement between the
Czech Republic and the Claimant, but between the Czech Republic and FITE.°” FITE is a Czech
joint stock company, which is owned as to 70% by CKD Praha DIZ a.s. and as to 30% by CKD
NOVE Energo a.s. The Claimant is an English holding company that was the majority shareholder

 

of CKD during the privatisation. Accordingly, there is no between a C ing Party

and an investor of the other Contracting Party as contemplated in Article 2(3).

The Claimant seeks to refute the Respondent’s objection on the basis that the Umbrella Clause

contains no privity of contract requirement.*”
It is first necessary to consider the relevant provisions of the BIT. Article 2(3) provides that:

Investors of one Contracting Party may conclude with the other Contracting Party
specific agreements, the provision and effect of which, unless more beneficial to the
investor, shall not be at variance with this Agreement. Each Contracting Party shall,
with regard the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, observe the
provisions of these specific agreements, as well as the provisions of this Agreement.

“Investors” in respect of the United Kingdom are defined under Article 1(c)(ii) to mean:

(aa) Physical persons deriving their status as United Kingdom nationals from the law in
force in the United Kingdom;

(bb) corporations, firms and associations incorporated or constituted under the law in
force in any part of the United Kingdom or in any territory to which this Agreement is
extended in accordance with the provisions of Article 12.

“Investments” is defined in Article (a) as:

[E]very kind of asset belonging to an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory
of the other Contracting Party under the law in force of the latter Contracting Party in
any sector of economic activity...

Article 1(a) enumerates a non-exhaustive list of different types of asset.

(1) “Specific agreements” under BIT Article 2(3)

Although “specific agreements” is not a defined term in Article 1, the Tribunal accepts that the first
sentence of Article 2(3) applies to give the term definition, This much is apparent from the second
sentence, which refers back to “these specific agreements”, thus creating a renvoi to the scope given
to “specific agreements” in the first sentence. Hence the ordinary meaning of the first sentence is

that a specific agreement is one between an investor (as defined) and a Contracting Party.

FITE is not an investor of the UK because it is incorporated in the Czech Republic, and there is no
deeming provision giving it standing as a wholly-owned subsidiary." Therefore, prima facie, the

SPA is not a “specific agreement” within the meaning of Article 2(3).

The Claimant contends that, as there is no privity of contract requirement in Article 2(3), it is
immaterial whether the investor concludes the specific agreement directly or through an investment
vehicle. Put another way, there must be an express privity of contract requirement for the Umbrella

Clause to be restricted to agreements between a UK investor and the Czech Republic.

The Parties joined issue on the requirement of privity under umbrella clauses in general. But even if
there is no requirement of privity under umbrella clauses couched in general terms (e.g. “any
obligation entered into with regard to investments”), in contrast, the BIT uses quite precise language:
it refers to “specific agreements” which are to be concluded between a Contracting Party and an
investor of the other Contracting Party. In the Tribunal!’s view, in accordance with the governing
principle of treaty interpretation, this language must be given effect, and it follows that the SPA is

not a specific agreement for the purposes of Article 2(3).

(2) Observation of undertakings in international law

The term “umbrella clause” is often used as a convenient shorthand for “observation of undertaking”.
That nomenclature does not expand the scope of the obligation to observe an undertaking under
international law. An undertaking is a formal and legally binding pledge to do something. States are
obliged under international law to observe their undertakings. This is, inter alia, part of the duty of

good faith and the principle of pacta sunt servanda.

The obligation to observe an undertaking is owed by the State that has given the undertaking. It is
owed to the party to which the undertaking has been given. It is not a freely transferrable obligation,
without the consent of the State that has given the undertaking (although such consent can be
identified in different ways, including by way of a treaty or a contract governed by municipal law).
The requisite elements of an undertaking to be observed under international law are a specific, clear

and direct commitment from a State to an identified beneficiary. It is not sufficient, for example,

CFICSID Convention, Art 25(3).

that there be a general policy, a generic statement of principle, a general legal principle or a municipal
Jaw of universal application (which would not include a law specifically identified to provide foreign

investment with protections or a law formalising a concession agreement).

An undertaking is likewise owed to the identified beneficiary of the undertaking. Under international
law, merely because a State may owe an obligation to observe an undertaking given to a company
does not mean that the State also owes that same obligation to observe the undertaking to that
company’s shareholders. Of course, that principle is subject to any specific transfer provisions, such

as in agreements to extend the benefit of the undertaking to shareholders, affiliates, heirs or assignees.

The scope of the obligation to observe an undertaking is separate and distinct from other obligations
under international law. Thus, it is not coterminous with the principles of FET. Although an entity
might have legitimate expectations in relation to an undertaking, that does not convert it into the
beneficiary of the undertaking. Nor does it expand the obligation of the undertaking State so as to
make it beholden to anyone other than the beneficiary.

(3)Privity of contract under umbrella clauses

The issue of the requirement of privity under umbrella clauses has been addressed in a number of
investment BIT arbitrations. There is no consensus, but the dominant view is that in respect of
contractual obligations, only parties entitled to enforce the obligation under the proper law of the

contract may sue.

In Azurix Corp. v. Argentina, the tribunal considered whether it had jurisdiction under the umbrella
clause in the US/Argentina BIT to consider obligations arising from a concession agreement between
the Claimant’s subsidiary and the Provence of Buenos Aires. The umbrella clause provided that
“[e]ach Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.” The

tribunal held as follows:

The Tribunal finds that none of the contractual claims as such refer to a contract between
the parties to these proceedings; neither the Province [of Buenos Aires] nor ABA are
parties to them. While Azurix may submit a claim under the BIT for breaches by
Argentina, there is no undertaking to be honored by Argentina to Azurix other than the
obligations under the BIT. Even if for argument’s sake, it would be possible under
Article II(2)(c) to hold Argentina responsible for the alleged breaches of the Concession

Agreement by the Province, it was ABA and not Azurix which was the party to this
Agreement.>¥

In Siemens v. Argentina, the tribunal held that: “to the extent that the obligations assumed by the
State party are of a contractual nature, such obligations must originate in a contract between the State
party to the BIT and the foreign investor...”.°”° On this basis, the tribunal concluded that obligations
in a contract between Siemens’ subsidiary and Argentina did not qualify under the umbrella clause

in the BIT between Germany and Argentina.

In 2007, the Annulment Committee in CMS v. Argentina criticised the tribunal for its seemingly
broad interpretation of the umbrella clause in the Argentina/US BIT,**° which gave CMS standing to
enforce obligations in a licence agreement between Argentina and a company in which CMS was a
minority shareholder. The Annulment Committee observed that there were “major difficulties” with

this reading of the umbrella clause, including, inter alia:

(b) Consensual obligations are not entered into erga omnes but with regard to particular
persons. Similarly the performance of such obligations or requirements occurs with
regard to, and as between, obligor and obligee.

(c) The effect of the umbrella clause is not to transform the obligation which is relied
on into something else; the content of the obligation is unaffected, as is its proper law.
Tf this is so, it would appear that the parties to the obligation (i.e., the persons bound by
it and entitled to rely on it) are likewise not changed by reason of the umbrella clause.°*!

In Burlington Resources v. Ecuador, the tribunal determined that the claimant could not rely on the
umbrella clause in the US/Ecuador BIT to enforce production sharing contracts entered into between
the claimant’s wholly owned subsidiary and Ecuador. As with the umbrella clause in the
US/Argentina BIT considered in Azurix and CMS, the US/Ecuador BIT required each state party to

The Tribunal did not express this interpretation, but it is implied by its finding that Argentina breached
obligations under the umbrella clause arising under the licence agreement: CMS Gas Transmission Company

Republic, 25 September 2007, RLA-37, #§ 93-94,

“observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.”**? The tribunal

articulated the following test to interpret the umbrella clause:

The word “obligation” is thus the operative term of the umbrella clause. The BIT does
not define “obligation”. The Parties agree — and rightly so — that the clause refers to
legal obligations. This is of little assistance, however, to resolve the question of privity.
To answer this question, the Tribunal relies primarily on two elements which in its view
inform the ordinary meaning of “obligation.” First, in its ordinary meaning, the
obligation of one subject is generally seen in correlation with the right of another. Or,
differently worded, someone's breach of an obligation corresponds to the breach of
another's right. An obligation entails a party bound by it and another one benefiting
from it, in other words, entails an obligor and an obligee. Second, an obligation does
not exist ina vacuum. It is subject to a governing law. Although the notion of obligation
is used in an international BIT, the court or tribunal interpreting the BIT may have to
look to municipal law to give it content. This is not peculiar to “obligation”; it applies
to other notions found in investment treaties, e.g. nationality, property, exhaustion of
local remedies to name just these. In this case, the PSCs are governed by Ecuadorian
law. It is that law that defines the content of the obligation including the scope of and
the parties to the undertaking, i.e. the obligor and the obligee.***

In respect of the first element, it can be seen that the tribunal elaborates on the concept of reciprocity

between “obligee” and “obligor” raised in CMS v. Argentina.

In Oxus Gold v. Uzbekistan, one of the grounds on which the tribunal decided that the claimant could
not rely on an umbrella clause to import obligations from an exploration agreement was because “the
parties to the PEA are Goskomgeology and Marakand and not the State and Oxus.”***

Goskomgeology was a State Committee of Uzbekistan and Marakand was a subsidiary of Oxus.

Finally, it is necessary to consider Continental Casualty v. Argentina. This case has been raised by
the Claimant in support of the conclusion that umbrella clauses apply to obligations between an
investor’s subsidiary and a host state.**° The Claimant refers to Continental Casualty only in respect

of its alternative submission that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under broader umbrella clauses in other

BITs through the MFN provision in the BIT (discussed below). However, it is relevant to look at it

here, in order to determine whether it impacts on the line of reasoning considered above.

Continental Casualty concerned the same US/Argentina BIT umbrella clause that was considered in

Azurix and CMS. With respect to the umbrella clause, the tribunal observed:

Finally, provided that these obligations have been entered “with regard” to investments,
they may have been entered with persons or entities other than foreign investors
themselves, so that an undertaking by the host State with a subsidiary such as CNA is not
in principle excluded.**
This statement is seemingly in conflict with the cases considered above. However, there are a number
of reasons why Continental Casualty should not upset the otherwise consistent jurisprudence on the
privity objection. First, in making this statement, the tribunal was referring to obligations of the host
state in general and not contractual promises in particular. Second, the tribunal did not ultimately
pursue its investigation of whether contractual obligations of Argentina were justiciable under the
umbrella clause because it had already decided Argentina could rely on the defence of necessity with
respect to those obligations.**” As such, it did not need to conduct a full analysis of the issue or engage
with cases that had resolved similar questions. Finally, it commented that the contracts in question
“could,..be considered as guaranteed by the umbrella clause, subject to the caveat that they were not
directed to foreign investors nor specifically addressed to their investments”.*** Accordingly, it is
not apparent that the contracts would have fallen under the umbrella clause even if the tribunal had

taken this question to its conclusion.

To summarise, the Claimant’s contention that there is no requirement of privity in relation to
umbrella clauses finds no authoritative support in the case law of international investment tribunals.
To the contrary, tribunals have rather consistently resolved that they have no jurisdiction under
umbrella clauses to consider contractual obligations between host states and investors’ locally

incorporated subsidiaries.

If it were necessary to do so, the Tribunal would uphold the requirement of privity even for generally
worded umbrella clauses, which are intended to give effect to legal commitments entered into by the

host state with regard to investments, not to change their scope or content.

This conclusion is reinforced by applying the reasoning of the tribunal in Burlington, which noted
that tribunals may have to look to municipal law to give content to an obligation. The tribunal
observed that “Burlington has not alleged, not to speak of established, that under Ecuadorian law the
non-signatory parent of a contract party may directly enforce its subsidiary's rights.”** Similarly, the
Claimant has not suggested that Czech law would entitle it to enforce the rights of FITE under the
SPA.

The Burlington tribunal added:

As to the terms “with regard to investments” also employed by the relevant BIT
provision, they denote a “link between the obligation and the investment” as Burlington
argued at the hearing. This is certainly in keeping with the object and purpose of the
BIT, which are to encourage and protect investments. However, as Ecuador pleaded,
this link “does not replace but qualifies” the notion of obligation. If there is no
obligation in the first place, there is nothing to qualify. Nor can these qualifications
create an “obligation” where there is none to begin with.*”°

The Claimant seeks to distinguish the present case from those considered above on the basis that the
SPA “includes multiple warranties applying to FITE and its ‘Affiliates’, including WNC”.>*! It refers
in this respect to EDF vy. Argentina, where the tribunal held that it had jurisdiction to consider
breaches of a concession agreement between a company in which the Claimants owned shares and
the Government of Mendoza. The tribunal rejected Argentina’s privity objection on the following
basis:

The Tribunal notes that Article 12 of the Concession Agreement makes explicit mention

of shareholders. That provision prohibits shareholders from transferring EDEMSA

shares without prior consent from EPRE, Respondent itself mentions at paragraph 231
of its Counter-Memorial that the Concession Agreement required authorization by the

Executive Power for the transfer of EDEMSA‘s majority shareholding during the first
5 years of the agreement's effective date”

It is apparent from this extract that the Concession Agreement in the EDF case imposed a positive
contractual obligation on the claimant companies not to transfer shares without prior consent. In
short, they were parties to the transaction, not merely beneficiaries. The SPA, however, does not
impose contractual obligations on the Claimant. Rather, FITE assumes certain contractual
obligations that extend to the conduct or state of affairs of the Claimant. This occurs in Clause 6.1(h)
of the SPA, which provides:

The Purchaser [FITE] warrants to the Seller on the Signing Date that all the below facts
(the Purchaser’s Warranties) are true, complete and correct and undertakes to ensure
that the facts remain true, complete and correct on each of the following days until and
including the Settlement Date:

(h) neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates are party to any judicial proceedings
or any arbitration proceedings against the Czech Republic and/or the Company...°

Jt is apparent to the Tribunal that Clause 6.1(h) is a contractual promise made solely by FITE which
does not bind the Claimant. As the SPA imposes no obligation on the Claimant, the Claimant and
the Respondent cannot be said have a relationship of obligor and obligee. The Claimant has no
standing to enforce any obligation under the SPA merely because it is referred to (in generic terms,

ie., as an “A ffiliate”) in certain provisions.

The Claimant argues that a restrictive interpretation of Article 2(3) would enable the Respondent “to
circumvent the BIT by prescribing domestic incorporation” as a condition of acquiring Skoda
Export.™ It says that this “would lead to a manifestly absurd result and should be rejected”.* But

as the seller in an open tender process, the Respondent was free to impose such a condition, and any

Under clause 1.1 of the SPA, ‘Affiliate’ means ‘in relation to any person, any other person that directly or
indirectly, through one or more persons, controls that person, is controlled by it or is controlled along with that
person.’ The Claimant would thus have been an ‘Affiliate’ of FITE.

potential bidder was free not to bid on those terms. It cannot be said that, if a foreign investor
voluntarily enters into an agreement which is clearly excluded from the plain terms of an umbrella
clause, there is a manifestly absurd result. This is all the more so because such an agreement would

not preclude the investor from recourse to other protections open to it gua investor under the BIT.

(4) Conclusion

For these reasons the Tribunal upholds the Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction in respect of the
Umbrella Clause claims, insofar as they concern obligations under the SPA, on the basis that the SPA

is not a specific agreement under Article 2(3) of the BIT.

3. Jurisdiction in respect of Czech law under the Umbrella Clause

The Claimant invokes the Umbrella Clause not only in respect of alleged breaches of the SPA, but
also for alleged violations of Czech law. It alleges that the Respondent:

(a) _ violated an express warranty in the SPA that it had complied with its own legal obligations,

including under Czech law;°* and

(b) breached “its implied contractual obligations of good faith under Czech law towards FITE

in the negotiation, execution and performance of the SPA”.°°”

The Respondent’s position is that the Umbrella Clause does not cover or concer provisions of

general legislation addressed to the public.°*

The Claimant’s first allegation (a) relates to clause 5.1(c) of the SPA, by which the Respondent

warranted that:

entering into this Agreement or by the meeting of the Seller’s obligations under this
Agreement will not result in any...breach of any valid legal regulation applicable to the
Seller.

The warranty does not impose any new obligation on the Respondent. What it does do is provide
FITE with a right to seek damages for a breach of domestic law by the MoF. But that right arises
from the SPA and is only enforceable by FITE. Article 2(3) does not extend rights to the Claimant
because the SPA is not a “specific agreement”: see paragraph 320. Consequently, the Tribunal has

no jurisdiction to consider the Claimant’s first allegation.

The Claimant’s second allegation (b) also presents difficulties. The Claimant does not point to any
source of Czech law to support its contention that there is an implied obligation of good faith when
negotiating agreements. For this reason, it is difficult for the Tribunal to analyse the content of any
such obligation. But even considering this question in the abstract, it is uncontroversial that umbrella
clauses do not elevate states’ domestic laws to the level of the BIT or convert them into promises.
The Annulment Committee in CMS stated that:

In speaking of “any obligations it may have entered into with regard to investments”, it
seems clear that Article II(2)(c) is concerned with consensual obligations arising
independently of the BIT itself (ie. under the law of the host State or possibly under
international law). Further they must be specific obligations concerning the investment.
They do not cover general requirements imposed by the law of the host State.°”

Even in Continental Casualty, which seemingly departed from other cases on the scope of umbrella
clauses, it was held that the “umbrella clause does not come into play when the breach complained
of concerns general obligations arising from the law of the host State”.°” On this basis, the umbrella

clause does not afford the Tribunal jurisdiction to consider the Claimant’s second allegation.

4. Article 3(1): Jurisdiction under the Umbrella Clause through the MFN clause

The Tribunal has concluded there is no “specific agreement” under Article 2(3). But it must also
consider the Claimant’s alternative argument that jurisdiction is established under more favourable

umbrella clauses in other BITs to which the Respondent is party.°! The Claimant contends that it

would be entitled to rely on more favourable umbrella clauses pursuant to Article 3(1), which

provides:

Each Contracting Party shall ensure that under its law investments or returns of investors
of the other Contracting Party are granted treatment not less favourable than that which
it accords to investments or returns of its own investors or to investments or returns of
investors of any third State.

The immediate problem with the Claimant’s reliance on the MFN provision is that, prima facie, the
Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear disputes arising under Article 3. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction
derives from Article 8(1) of the BIT, which provides that:

Disputes between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party
concerning an obligation of the latter under Articles 2(3), 4, 5 and 6 of this Agreement
in relation to an investment of the former which have not been amicably settled shall,
after a period of four months from written notification of a claim, be submitted to
arbitration under paragraph 2 below if either party to the dispute so wishes.

This part of the Claimant’s case concerns a dispute as to the application and interpretation of the
Article 3, which is not provided for in Article 8(1).

The Claimant makes the argument that, because Article 2(3) of the BIT is activated by the existence
of a “specific agreement”, the second sentence of the Article applies to extend jurisdiction to all
substantive obligations in the BIT.“ The Claimant makes this argument in order to bring its FET
claim under Article 2(2) of the BIT within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, but the argument could in
principle apply with respect to Article 3(1). However, as the Tribunal has already resolved that there
is no “specific agreement” under Article 2(3), that provision cannot be relied upon to expand the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction. But even if the SPA were a “specific agreement”, for the reasons which
follow, the Tribunal would not agree with the Claimant’s interpretation of the second sentence of
Article 2(3).

The ordinary meaning to be given to the second sentence of Article 2(3) is to be informed by the

context of that sentence within wider text of the BIT, including Article 8(1).

The meaning of Article 8(1) is clear. The only obligations that may be the subject of arbitration are
those contained in the specified articles, including Article 2(3). If Article 8(1) did not exist, the effect
of the second sentence of Article 2(3) might well be as the Claimant interprets it. But read in
conjunction with Article 8(1), it is clear that it cannot be intended to extend an arbitral tribunal’s
jurisdiction to all other substantive obligations in the BIT. If that were the case, Article 8(1) would

be superfluous. In this respect, the Tribunal concurs with the Respondent’s effet utile argument.

The second sentence of Article 2(3) must be read in the context of Article 2(3) in its entirety as well
as the structure of Article 2 generally. Article 2 is divided into three parts; each imposes a substantive
obligation on the Contracting Parties. The first relates to the admission of foreign capital, the second
to FET and the third to investor-State contracts. The second sentence of Article 2(3) does not sit
apart as a separate requirement. It is included in Article 2(3) and therefore the Tribunal would infer

that its effect was intended to be limited to the Umbrella Clause.

The Tribunal also does not consider that the Respondent's interpretation is right. The Respondent’s
view is that the second sentence is merely intended to ensure that national courts considering a
specific agreement take into account all applicable law, including the BIT.®* But this cannot be
correct because there is no reference to courts or what they need to consider. To the contrary, the

obligation in question is imposed expressly on the Contracting Parties under the BIT.

In the Tribuna!’s opinion, the correct interpretation of the second sentence of Article 2(3) is that the
Contracting Party has an obligation both to adhere to the specific agreement and to observe the BIT
protections in so far as those protections are contained in the specific agreement. Thus, if a specific
agreement contained a protection tantamount to the FET standard, a tribunal would have jurisdiction
to consider a breach of that standard. This interpretation gives effect to the ordinary meaning of
Article 2(3) when read in its context. It links with the idea in the first sentence of Article 2(3) that
specific agreements might contain protections equivalent or superior to (but not less than) those
contained in the BIT. It also has an effet utile in that it bars a respondent party from arguing there is
no jurisdiction to hear a claim based on an obligation in a specific agreement where that obligation

is mirrored in the BIT but not captured by Article 8(1).

If the SPA is not a “specific agreement”, then the Claimant cannot rely on Article 2(3) to expand the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction. However, even if the Tribunal had held that the SPA was a “specific
agreement”, it does not contain protections commensurate with or superior to the protections in the

BIT that are not covered by Article 8(1).

On this basis, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to determine the Claimant’s arguments based on the
MEN clause.

5. Exclusive jurisdiction of Czech Courts

The Respondent also contends that claims in respect of the SPA are inadmissible because Czech
courts have exclusive jurisdiction over those claims. In its view, if the Claimant wishes to enforce
the obligations in the SPA, it must comply with the modalities of enforcement of those obligations
in the SPA,

In the SPA, dispute resolution is addressed by Clause XIV, which provides:

Any dispute that arises between the Parties based on or in connection with this
Agreement shall be decided by the court in Prague having subject-matter jurisdiction,
unless exclusive jurisdiction of a court is stipulated.

The Respondent relies on the line of cases holding that umbrella clause claims brought contrary to
an exclusive jurisdiction clause in the relevant contract are inadmissible. Since, for the reasons
stated, the Umbrella Clause claim falls outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on other grounds, the issue
of admissibility need not be further discussed,

6. Jurisdiction over the FET claim

that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear its FET claim under Article 2(2) arises by virtue of the
operation of Article 2(3).°” As the Tribunal has already decided, in relation to the MFN clause,
Article 2(3) cannot operate to extend the Tribunal’s jurisdiction beyond Article 8(1) in the absence
of a “specific agreement”. Accordingly, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear to the FET claim
arising under Article 2(2).

7. Jurisdiction over the expropriation claim

The Tribunal considers that, as the Respondent conceded during argument,

it has jurisdiction to
hear the Claimant’s expropriation claim as Article 8(1) of the BIT extends to disputes arising inter

alia under Article 5.

8. Jurisdiction over the general international law claim

The Claimant further requests that the Tribunal declare that the Respondent has breached
international law in relation to the Claimant's investment.” As the Tribunal has already decided, in
relation to other claims submitted by the Claimant, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is constrained by
Article 8(1). It matters not whether the facts before the Tribunal might have given rise to a claim
under international law or under provisions of the BIT not listed in Article 8(1). Although principles
of international law are of course applicable to the interpretation of that Article and, indeed, the entire
BIT, they cannot on their own provide a basis to expand the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction as
expressly set out in Article 8(1). Accordingly, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear to the

Claimant’s general international law claim.

LIABILITY

As the Tribunal has decided that it does not have jurisdiction to hear claims under the Umbrella

Clause or the FET clause, the Tribunal is confined to the Claimant’s remaining expropriation claim.

The Claimant’s principal expropriation case is that the Respondent dealt its investment three critical
blows which resulted in its “destruction”.*° First, CEB and EGAP failed to provide critically needed
funding, Second, CEB and EGAP attempted to divert its projects to third parties. Finally, CEB and
the MoF acted to freeze Skoda Export’s bank accounts.

The Claimant, in its Statement of Claim, reserved the right to advance an expanded expropriation
claim in the event the Tribunal made a determination (as it has done) that it has no jurisdiction to
hear the Umbrella Clause or FET claims. The Claimant said that its expanded expropriation case

would be based on all the factual allegations it makes in the case. It contended that:

the Czech Republic’s blatant and deliberate misrepresentations in connection with the
SPA can and should be conceptualised as the first of a series of acts that gradually and
directly caused the complete devaluation of the Claimant’s investment, until the
complete extinguishment of its value.°'*

However, the Claimant did not plead out its expanded case in its pleadings or at the hearing.
Moreover, it did not elaborate on the individual allegations which would make up the expanded
expropriation claim, In the absence of any pleadings on the broader claim, the Respondent could not
be expected to, and did not in fact, defend the claim. For its part, the Tribunal is not in a position to
make any determination with respect to the expanded expropriation claim. Even if it were in a
position to do so, it notes that there would likely be serious difficulties in establishing that events
occurring prior to the sale of Skoda Export to FITE were expropriatory in character. This is because
the investment in question had not come into existence at that time and so it is unlikely that it could

be considered to have been taken (or partially taken) by the Respondent.

1. The expropriation claim

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent, through EGAP and CEB, offered export financing for
Skoda Export’s projects on unreasonable and unconscionable terms, terms that the institutions knew
were impossible for Skoda Export to accept.°? The Respondent knew that the requested finance was
critical to Skoda Export’s projects and its failure to offer financing on acceptable terms resulted in

the expropriation of the Claimant’s investment.°?

The Claimant further alleges that CEB and EGAP attempted to divert Skoda Export’s projects to a
third party contractor, BTG. These acts damaged Skoda Export’s reputation and relationships at a
critical stage.

Finally, the Claimant alleges that CEB took steps to freeze Skoda Export’s bank accounts on false
and unsubstantiated grounds. Further, once the Freezing Orders were in place, the Respondent did.

not take adequate steps to have them lifted.°°

The Claimant contends that these three events directly caused Skoda Export’s insolvency. It argues
that the Freezing Orders prevented it from meeting its obligations to creditors and irreparably

damaged its reputation.''®

This, it says, was a direct cause of a flood of bankruptcy petitions in June
2009 and the declaration of insolvency made by the Insolvency Court in November 2009.’ The
Claimant does not expect to receive any distribution from the liquidation in respect of its equity in

Skoda Export.5!*

The Claimant alleges that the above events formed part of a campaign against Skoda Export that was
“triggered by the personal vendetta of high-ranking officials of the Respondent against

who orchestrated measures intended to inflict damage upon business interest in the
Czech Republic, including Skoda Export”.

The Respondent disputes each allegation made by the Claimant and denies the existence of a
conspiracy against Skoda Export. It further says that it has not breached Article 5 of the BIT on the
grounds that (i) the conduct of the CEB and EGAP is not attributable to the Respondent under
international law; (ii) even if such conduct were attributable to the Respondent, the Freezing Orders
constituted a legitimate exercise of police powers under international law; and (iii) Skoda Export’s

insolvency was not caused by the Czech Republic.”

2. Analysis of the expropriation claim

The expropriation claim gives rise to a number of distinct legal and factual questions which require
determination. The Tribunal will first make findings with respect to the factual allegations made by
the Claimant. It will then consider whether the Claimant has made out its expropriation claim under
Article 5 of the BIT.

Based on the material available to the Tribunal, there are serious issues which arise in attributing the
conduct of CEB and GAP to the Respondent under Article 5 of the ILC Articles. However, consistent
with the decision in Waste Management,*' the Tribunal does not need to consider the attribution

issue unless it finds that there is conduct capable of breaching the expropriation standard in the BIT.

(1) Factual allegations

Existence of a conspiracy

The Claimant alleges that the MoF was CEB’s puppeteer in a campaign by the bank against Skoda
Export. The Claimant says, for instance, that “senior government officials used aggressive tactics

against to induce him to cease broadcasting the Ministry’s fraudulent misrepresentation

during the privatisation...” It also contends that “[bJoth the Ministry and CEB knew that such an
investigation would place undue pressure on Skoda Export and could lead it, as it eventually did, to

bankruptcy”.

However, the Claimant adduced no evidence to corroborate its allegation of
conspiracy. Its case relies on the witness evidence of. , who in turn relied on supposition

and inference. For instance, he said:

Mr Pokorny would not have acted in this way unless he was certain to have the support
of the Czech Ministry of Finance, and more precisely the Minister of Finance at the
time, Mr Kalousek. Mr Pokorny’s hostile behaviour continued even after Mr Kalousek
was replaced by Mr Eduard Janota in May 2009. I believe that Messrs Kalousek and
Janota were fully aware at all times of the status of CKD’s negotiations with CEB, and
also of the requests that CEB was making of CKD in the context of the financing
package. Messrs Kalousek and Janota would have been aware that CEB was seeking to
transfer Skoda Export’s projects to BTG Energy.

The Claimant also referred to the minutes of the CEB Directors meeting of 23 April 2009, and in
particular the board’s decision ‘to inform the Czech Ministry of Finance...about the entire case’, as

evidence of the Ministry’s invisible hand in the affair.°*

But it does not follow from the Ministry’s
subsequent awareness of CFR’s treatment that the Ministry instructed, or directed and controlled,

CEB’s treatment ex ante.

In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant asks the Tribunal to draw an adverse inference trom Minister
Kalousek’s failure to appear and give evidence at the hearing.* Minister Kalousek has (or should
have had) much to say on that topic. But the Claimant has not produced even prima facie evidence
supporting the alleged conspiracy, and the Tribunal is not in a position to draw any adverse inference
against Minister Kalousek vis-a-vis the MoF’s involvement in CEB’s treatment of Skoda Export.

have been, the Tribunal does not think that an adverse inference, standing alone and unsupported by

other evidence, can carry the day.

Failure to provide critically needed funding

The Claimant sought a loan from CEB for CZK 1 billion (USD 60 million), which CEB refused to
grant. The Claimant says that, while there was no legal obligation on CEB to provide the funding,
“providing assistance to Skoda Export would have been seen either as a form of compensation or
settlement of legal claims arising out of the SPA, or as a reasonable commercial transaction”.

The Claimants case is thus framed in two ways. First, the Respondent owed the Claimant damages
by virtue of its breaches of the SPA, and the way this debt should have been discharged was through
a grant or soft loan framed as made by CEB as the principal liable for repayment or alternatively to
be expressed as repayable conditional upon the receipt of moneys from the impugned and doubtful
projects. This was the proposed route because state aid rules would have prevented the Respondent
from making the payment or loans directly. Additionally, it was seeking a loan from CEB on
“commercial terms” and that CEB acted unreasonably in rejecting its terms and imposing more

onerous conditions.

Apart from the live issue whether the proposals for uncertain and conditional obligations for
repayment without adequate security may be characterised as “commercial”, in the Tribunal’s
opinion, these two arguments are contradictory and mutually undermining. With respect to the first
argument, it is not possible that a loan can be equated with a compensation payment as a loan would
require repayment with interest and hence would not compensate for the damage suffered by the
Claimant. As to the second argument, it cannot be said that a loan sought to compensate for alleged

damages suffered by the Claimant is a loan on commercial terms.

The Claimant argues that the loan would have been commercial for CEB because to not grant it and
to let the projects fail would necessarily result in the Respondent having to pay out the projects’
customers a sum of up to USD 70 million on guarantees earlier given.* But if CEB thought that the

projects were unlikely to be successful, it could well have been more prudent for it to cut its losses

and forfeit USD 70 million than to commit an additional USD 60 million and risk losing almost
double its original investment. There are a number of reasons why CEB might have thought the
projects were no longer safe investments, including that NEPRA had not approved any increase in

the project payments,°° which was the only thing that would have made either project (marginally)
profitable and allowed for the repayment of the loan amounts. In the absence of that decision there

was a great risk of throwing good money after bad.

The Tribunal considers that CEB’s refusal to grant the loan to Skoda Export on the terms demanded
was nothing more than a commercial decision which CEB was free to make as it saw fit. There was
no obligation on CEB to grant the loan arising from legal claims made by the Claimant against the
Respondent or otherwise. Nor, in the Tribunal’s view, was the decision to refuse funding shown to

haye been part of any broader conspiracy to undermine and erode the value of Skoda Export.

Transfer of Skoda Export’s projects

This part of the Claimant’s case concerns allegations that CEB and EGAP attempted to transfer the
Claimant’s key projects to third parties. It allegedly did so by bullying and threatening the Claimant’s

proposed transfer.©?

The Respondent does not deny that it entered into discussions with stakeholders regarding a transfer
of the projects." However, it disputes the allegations of threats and disagrees with the timing of
events proposed by the Claimant. The Claimant suggests that the attempts to transfer happened from
April 2009, whereas the Respondent says they occurred from June 2009. Moreover, the parties

disagree as to motive. The Claimant alleges it was a corrupt attempt at enrichment for a member of

CEB.*6 The Respondent says that it was a commercial move to rescue the projects after they had

637

been de facto abandoned by the Claimant Moreover, it says that its attempts to transfer were

openly discussed with the Claimant and that the Claimant was in principle open to the idea.*

In the Tribunal’s view, the allegations of threats and harassment against the Claimant’s management
are not made out on the evidence. The evidence relied upon, in respect of the meeting with CEB, is
the witness testimony of . It is not corroborated by contemporaneous documentary
evidence. Moreover, the Respondent in its Post-Hearing Brief shows the inconsistencies in
witness statements and oral testimony, successfully undermining the credibility of his
evidence.” The other evidence is of SMS messages sent to . However, as the Claimant
concedes in its Post-Hearing Brief, these were sent from disposable phones and SIM cards and the
police were not able to connect them with any individual or organisation.“ As such, the Tribunal

has no basis to find that they originated from CEB or one of its affiliates,

Furthermore, it is clear on the evidence that from 21 June 2009, the Claimant was at least open to
discussing the transfer of its projects with CEB. This is born out in emails produced by the Parties.
On 10 June 2009, Mr Porkony sent an email to discussing the takeover of the projects.!
On the same day, responded, stating he wants “to discuss the provision of additional
finance etc...I don’t think that a takeover was ever a topic”.? Yet, by 16 June 2009, a director of
CEB sent a proposal for the transfer to » who responded on 21 June 2009 that he was
“ready to negotiate with [CEB] about the proposed arrangement”. Given the Claimant was open
to the possibility of transferring projects, it cannot complain of discussions had by CEB about this

possibility with relevant suitors and stakeholders.

Freezing of bank accounts

With respect to the Freezing Orders, it is alleged that CEB (with the knowledge and support of the
MoF) acted to freeze the Skoda Export’s accounts on the basis of false and unsubstantiated charges.“
It also alleges that CEB was under an obligation to consult with and inform the Claimant of its
concerns about the transactions prior to notifying the authorities.“* The submission is that for these

reasons the freezing of Skoda Export’s accounts with CEB was unlawful.

As to the first complaint, although the Tribunal need not make a positive finding, at the least it
appears to the Tribunal that, as the Respondent contends, the circumstances summarised in paragraph
161 of the Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief ex facie, and as otherwise established by the actions
taken by WNC to rescind the SPA and cast adrift its control of FITE during the last 14 days of April
2009, suffice to justify the administrative actions leading to the Freezing Orders being made.

As to the second complaint, the Claimant points to no positive legal obligation on banks to contact
or inform customers prior to notifying authorities of suspicious transactions. To the contrary, banks
are prohibited from warning customers that a suspicious activity report is, or is likely, to be filed.”
Whilst banks have an inspection obligation“ — meaning that they need to do some due diligence on
the transaction before notifying authorities — this does not necessarily require the making of enquiries
of the customer. This position is, as far as the Tribunal is aware, general in Europe, and not an

idiosyncrasy of Czech money-laundering regulations.

The only corroborating documentary evidence adduced by the Claimant in support of its allegation
that the filing of the suspicious activity reports was improper is the decision by the Prague District
State Attorney’s Office lifting the Freezing Orders.“ The Claimant says that it was found that “the
suspicious transaction reports filed by CEB were baseless and unwarranted, and that CEB was aware

of the negative impact that the Freezing Orders would have on Skoda Export’s ability to complete its

ptojects”.%° However, this report is directed merely to the outcome of the enquiries enlivened by the
making of the Report, not to the propriety of the circumstances under which it was made. The

conclusion of the Report by the District State Attorney was as follows:

Based on this evidence, it can no longer be inferred that the financial funds of PA
EXPORT, a.s. carried on the accounts of these banks were designated to committing a
crime. Therefore, the attachment of the cash funds is no longer required and may be
lifted,

The report is not critical of CEB, and there is nothing to support the Claimant’s contention that CEB

acted improperly in filing a suspicious activity report.

The Claimant further alleges that, after the Freezing Orders were imposed, “the Police Authority took
an inordinate amount of time to conduct its investigation”.**’ But the Claimant does not further
substantiate this claim. In fact, it explains that it submitted a request to the District State Attorney’s
Office to lift the Freezing Orders on 28 May 2009 and that the request was granted on 5 June 2009.5?
In the circumstances there is nothing to suggest that the authorities were unresponsive or untimely in

investigating and lifting the Freezing Orders.

The Respondent argues that the steps taken to impose and maintain the Freezing Orders were
“legitimate actions in pursuit of the exercise of the police powers of the state,” The Claimant
“accepts that in certain cases the legitimate exercise of [police] powers would not result in an
obligation to compensate the Claimant”.** However, it says that the powers must be exercised: (i) in
good faith; (ii) for a public purpose; (iii) in a way proportional to that purpose; and (iv) in a non-

discriminatory manner.°**

It is uncontroversial that “States are not liable to pay compensation to a foreign investor when, in the

normal exercise of their regulatory powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner bona fide

regulations that are aimed at the general welfare”. In the present case, based on the evidence before
it, the Tribunal is satisfied that the imposition of the Freezing Orders meets the four criteria stipulated
by the Claimant. As explained above, CEB acted in accordance with money laundering rules and
the District State Attorney’s Office investigated the basis for the Freezing Orders in a timely manner
and directed that they be lifted.

(2) Did the Respondent’s conduct amount to expropriation?

The Tribunal has decided, with respect to each allegation made by the Claimant, that there was no
unlawful or improper conduct on the part of the Respondent. It has also determined that there was
no conspiracy implicating the MoF and connecting the three events. That being so, the events
complained of were not, in the circumstances, expropriatory acts. The refusal to grant the loan and
the discussions regarding transfer of assets were commercial decisions by CEB, made with the
knowledge and involvement of the Claimant. The decision to report the suspicious transfers was
taken in accordance with applicable money-laundering legislation and the Freezing Orders were
lifted promptly. These were not regulatory acts which had the effect of confiscating, or unreasonably

interfering in the enjoyment of, the investment.

As the tribunal in Pope & Talbot Inc y. Canada noted, “[t]he test is whether that interference is
sufficiently restrictive to support the conclusion that the property has been ‘taken’ from the
owner”. Even taking the (overly) broad definition of expropriation in Metalclad Corporation v.
Mexico, the interference with the use of the property must have “the effect of depriving the owner”
of the expected economic benefit of the property.°*

It can be a difficult task to pinpoint any one event (or even a series of events) which directly results
in a company not being able to pay its debts. Skoda Export suffered from management problems and
was mired in financial difficulty before its acquisition by FITE. The company had a plethora of
competing financial commitments under a number of contracts across a range of jurisdictions. For

instance, the Respondent points to payments of CZK 300 million made by Skoda Export to

consultants at ETAL, Ashfield and Sky Invest between June 2008 and April 2009.5 In these
circumstances, it is difficult to accept that these three isolated events caused its demise. More likely,
it was the accumulation of numerous internal decisions taken over a number of years, combined with

various market and political factors in the Czech Republic and the countries in which it operated.

With respect to the apparent attempts by CEB and EGAP to transfer Skoda Export’s assets, no actual
transfer took place. At most the harm from this activity was reputational. Reputational problems do
not provide a legal basis for the filing of bankruptcy petitions or for a declaration of insolvency. It
is also not apparent that the Freezing Orders were the cause, or even a cause, of the insolvency.
Skoda Export failed to make payments to its creditors both before and after the Freezing Orders were
imposed. It also wrote to CEB and EGAP regarding its dire financial predicament before the Freezing
Orders were put in place. For instance, a restructuring plan the Respondent emailed to EGAP on 6
April 2009 provided:

The above co-operation/financial aid is required within the order of weeks; otherwise,
the following is impending/has already occurred:

(b) Collapse of CEX at the end of April 20091

The orders were imposed on 24 April 2009 and were in place for 29 business days. The Claimant
has not shown that the failure to pay creditors within that period resulted in its bankruptcy and
insolvency. It has also not shown that, absent these events, Skoda Export would not have been made
insolvent or that, in the event it were declared insolvent, FITE would have recovered some value in

the liquidation.

@

@

The conduct of the Respondent prior to the sale of Skoda Export cannot fall within

Article 5 because the investment did not exist at that time;

There is no evidence of any conspiracy on the part of the Respondent to destroy Skoda
Export. Thus there is nothing to link together the individual acts said to give rise to
the expropriation;

CEB’s decision to refuse funding was not an expropriation of Skoda Export. In the
absence of any obligation to provide a loan to Skoda Export, the refusal was nothing
more than a commercial decision which CEB was free to make in any way it chose.
In addition, the Claimant has not proved that the failure to obtain finance was a factor

which directly resulted in its bankruptcy and eventual insolvency;

CEB and EGAP’s discussions with stakeholders regarding the transfer of assets were
made with the knowledge and (at least tacit) consent of the Claimant. Moreover, as
no actual transfer took place, there was no taking of the assets which could constitute
an expropriation;

The imposition and maintenance of the Freezing Orders was a legitimate exercise of
police powers by the Respondent. In any event, the Claimant has not proved that the

Freezing Orders were a direct cause of its insolvency.

It follows as to issues of liability that the Claimant's claims, as set out in paragraph 58 above, wholly

fail from a combination of objections on grounds of admissibility and jurisdiction and on the merits

on the expropriation ground for breach of Article 5 obligations, including any claims alleging breach

of international law other than that arising under the BIT.

Damages: Hence, the claims for damages and quantum and other relief set out in Part D above do

not fall for consideration.

cases have been incorrectly calculated.°”

According to paragraphs | and 2 of Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the allocation of costs is
addressed differently as to Tribunal costs on the one hand (paragraphs (a) to (d), and (f) of Article
38) and the parties’ own costs of representation and assistance on the other hand (paragraph (e) of
Article 38), Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides as follows:

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne
by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such
costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into
account the circumstances of the case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article
38, paragraph (ce), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case,
shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs
between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.

3. Fixing the costs of the arbitration

The Parties deposited with the PCA a total of USD 905,000 (USD 452,500 by the Claimant;
USD 452,500 by the Respondent) to cover the costs of arbitration.

The fees of Professor Robert Volterra, the arbitrator appointed by the Claimants, amount to
USD 207,390.00. His expenses amount to USD 7,850.03. The fees of Judge James Crawford, the
arbitrator appointed by the Respondent, amount to USD 201,316.25. The fees of Dr Gavan Griffith,
the presiding arbitrator, amount to USD 312,322.50, His expenses amount to USD 6,020.55.

Pursuant to the Terms of Appointment and the agreement of the Parties, the International Bureau of
the PCA was designated to act as Registry in this arbitration. The PCA’s fees for registry services
amount to USD 82,388.86. Other tribunal costs, including court reporters, hearing rooms, meeting
facilities, travel, bank charges, and all other expenses relating to the arbitration proceedings, amount
to USD 87,711.81,

Based on the above figures, the combined Tribunal costs, comprising the items covered in Article 38
(a), (b) and (c) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, as enumerated above, are fixed at a total of
USD 905,000.00. These costs are deducted from the deposit, with no unexpended balance to be

returned to the Parties.

Finally, under Article 38(e), the Tribunal finds the costs claimed by the successful party, the
Respondent, to be reasonable in amount and proportionate to the nature and complexity of the matter.
For the purposes of Article 38(e), the Tribunal therefore fixes Respondent’s legal and other costs of
representation at CZK 35,595,254.34 (comprising CZK 27,824,759.32 for its legal fees and CZK
7,770,495.02 for its expert’s fees).

4 Allocating the costs of arbitration

With respect to the tribunal costs, the Tribunal applies the general principle of “costs follow the
event.” That approach is the more compelling here given that the UNCITRAL Rules expressly
contemplate the rule of “costs follow the event” in Article 40(1) by its emphasis on “success” or its
opposite. This conclusion is bolstered by both Parties’ choice to argue that the unsuccessful side in
this arbitration bear the full amount of tribunal costs as well as the successful Party’s costs of legal

representation.

While the Tribunal retains discretion to apportion the tribunal costs between the Parties if it
determines that such apportionment is “reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the
case”, it is not persuaded that such circumstances exist in the present case. Accordingly, the Tribunal
determines, pursuant to Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, that it is reasonable to apportion the
costs of the arbitration between the Parties such that the Claimant shall bear the full costs of the

Tribunal.

With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in Article 38, paragraph
(e), the Tribunal notes that there is no equivalent presumption in Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL
Rules that the unsuccessful party shall bear such costs. The Tribunal is “free to determine which
party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that

apportionment is reasonable.”

As to the costs for legal representation, as defined under Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules,
although the Tribunal considers that each Party’s conduct during the course of proceedings was
reasonable, efficient and professional, it remains that the Claimant was entirely unsuccessful in result,
in the context that many of the factual issues already had been litigated to finality in curial

proceeding.

Each Party’s Costs Submissions were predicated upon costs awards to follow the event, and neither
proposed in advance the not uncommon costs orders made in investment disputes that no costs orders

be made.

It appears to the Tribunal that in all the circumstances it is appropriate for its costs determinations to
reflect the Parties’ common positions as to the appropriate basis for professional costs and other
expenses to be ordered by reference to the result. On this approach, no occasion arises for analysis
of the net result on the many separate issues, as their disposition was entirely one way to the
Respondent. Hence, in the terms of Article 40(2), set out above, the Tribunal does not regard it as

appropriate to any portion of the Respondent’s actual costs not to be reimbursed by the Claimant.

Quantum

As to quantum, ex facie the separate claims by the Respondent for actual costs and expenses

comprising —
Expert fees and expenses CZK 7,770,495.02
Compensation for Witnesses CZK 345,345.00
Counsel Fees: CZK 25,217,815.70

objectively appear reasonable in subject matter and amount having regard to the course of this
contested dispute, as is confirmed by the extensive summaries of facts and argumentation and
determination of issues in the course of this dispute. The fact that the similar professional costs and
expenses sought by the Claimant are a multiple of the actual costs of the Respondent is not separately

determinative of reasonableness, nonetheless they may be referred to as confirmatory of this factor.

424. It follows that the costs decisions of the Tribunal is that the Claimant should bear the entire costs of
the dispute by reimbursing to the Respondent for its net arbitration costs advanced of USD 452,500
and also to pay the Respondent’s professional and other costs and expenses to the total amount of
CZK 35,940,599.34.
