Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 17 of 375

INTRODUCTION

The present case is regarding a dispute filed before the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Center”) pursuant to the Agreement on Promotion and
Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Venezuela,
(“BIT” or the “Treaty”) executed on November 2, 1995 and in force as of September 10, 1997.

The Claimants, Valores Mundiales, S.L. (“Valores”) and Consorcio Andino, S.L. (“Consorcio”),
are two sociedades de responsabilidad limitada with corporate domicile in Madrid, Spain (the
“Claimants”).

 

The Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (“Venezuela”, the “Respondent” or the
“Republic”).

 

The Claimants and the Respondent shall be hereinafter jointly referred to as the “Parties”. The
complete list of the representatives of the Parties and their corresponding domiciles are included
in page (i) of this Award.

The Tribunal has analyzed all the arguments, claims, annexes and legal capacity of the Parties.
The fact that this Tribunal makes no reference or does not quote an argument or document, does
not entail that the Tribunal has failed to consider it.

In summary, the Claimants request the Tribunal to declare that Venezuela has violated Articles V
(expropriation), IV (fair and equitable treatment), III (arbitrary and discriminatory measures) and
VII (transfers) of the BIT, and to determine that such violations have caused them damages and
loss of profits. Consequently, the Claimants request the Tribunal to hold the Respondent
responsible for paying an indemnification pursuant to the BIT and international law, to order the

ient from refraining to impose | liens on the ii
costs and expenses related with this arbitration.

ification and to pay all the

The Respondent contests the claims of the Claimants, and requests the Tribunal to declare that it
lacks jurisdiction over those claims, and that such claims are inadmissible. In the event the
Tribunal concludes it has jurisdiction, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to declare that
Venezuela has not breached its obligations under the BIT and, in the event the Tribunal finds the
existence of responsibility, to deny the claim for damages given for lack of evidence under
international law. Finally, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to require Claimants to pay the
costs and expenses of the arbitration p dings and to la for the

incurred in its defense.

the same date, the Parties executed the document “Certificate of Valuation Completion and
Negotiation Base Price Determination”.

110. On January 17, 2011, the Claimants sent a report on the valuation process of the Companies to
the Ministry of Agriculture and Property®*. The Parties dispute the purpose and scope of this

- to “formalize petitions, requests or requirements before the National, State or Municipal Public
Administration Entities, as well as before the necessary public or private entities."

115. On November 30, 2011, the Claimants and the Ministry of Food executed a “Commitment Letter”
with the purpose of “evaluating the feasibility of developing cooperation mechanisms to
commence negotiations for the integration, installation and initiation of a strategic alliance in the
agro-industrial food sector, in order to incorporate two joint ventures, [...]** (the “Commitment
Letter”).

116. Thereafter, in December 2011, the Claimants proposed to Venezuela to execute an “Agreement
of Intent” in connection with the creation and development of the strategic alliance provided for
in the Commitment Letter dated November 30, 2011°’. On December 27, 2011, at the request of
the Ministry of Food, the Attorney General’s Office issued its “observations” on the “Commitment
Letter”, the “Agreement of Intent” and the “Bylaws Draft” submitted for its consideration.

117. On the same date, the Ministry of F ‘ood recommended the Presidency of the Republic to (i)

the Parties in October 2013. The Claimants argue that there have been no conversations between
the Parties since the end of 2014°°,

D. ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES WITH RESPECT OF WHETHER THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN
MEASURES PRIOR TO DECREE NO. 7.394 AND MEASURES THEREAFTER.

The Claimants have argued throughout this arbitration that there is a link between the measures
prior to Decree No. 7.394 and measures thereafter, i.e., between the measures affecting the
Companies and arising from and relating to, the criminal process advanced against Mr. Fernandez
Barrueco and the measures arising from and relating to, the aforementioned Decree. The
Respondent denies the existence of such relationship.

Through a notice dated February 17, 2016, the Tribunal requested the Parties to submit briefs after
the Hearing answering the question of “whether or not there exists, depending on the position of
each Party, a link between the measures prior to [Decree No. 7.394] and measures thereafter”.
Both Parties submitted their post-hearing writs on April 5, 2016.

1. | Claimants’ Position

The Claimants argue that there is a close link between measures prior to Decree No. 7.394 and
measures thereafter, as well as between those measures and the Decree itself”. According to the
Claimants, Venezuela would have used these measures to indirectly appropiate the Companies
without paying any compensation to the Claimants’'. Furthermore, the imposition of the measures
and the Decree itself resulted in an unfair and inequitable treatment in violation of the BIT.

According to the Claimants, the measures prior to Decree No. 7.394 and measures thereafter have
the same origin and basis”.

First, the Claimants argue that the imposition of the special administration on the Companies, as
well as freezing their bank accounts and the prohibition to register or notarize corporate acts -
both prior to Decree No. 7.394 - had their origin in the order issued in December 2009 by the then
President Hugo Chavez to “occupy” and take ownership of the companies that were allegedly
owned by Mr. Fernandez Barrueco”. A few months after the imposition of these measures, when,
according to the Claimants, it became clear that the Companies were not owned by Mr. Fernandez
Barrueco, the President signed the Decree No. 7.39474. According to the Claimants, one of the
basis of the Decree is precisely the imposition of seizure and special administration measures”®.

Second, the Claimants suggest that the measures subsequent to the Decree, particularly the

creation of the Liaison Commission and the issuance of the Administrative Ordinance, have their
origin and foundation on the orders of President Chavez to “occupy” and “recover” the
Companies”. Indeed, the Claimants point out, that the Liaison Commission originates on Decree
No. 7.394 and is based on the seizure and special administration measures. The Administrative
Ordinance is based on these measures which, in turn, originate in the orders of President Chavez”

Third, the Claimants affirm that there is certain identity between the special administration and
the Liaison Commission insofar as both (i) were imposed by the Executive Branch pursuant to
orders issued by the then President Chavez; (ii) have had the purpose of promoting Venezuela's
agro-food security and sovereignty policies; and (iii) they have had to adjust their actions to the
guidelines of the Ministry of Food’®.

Particularly, the Claimants argue that since May 2011, two “mirrors” of the Liaison Commission

were appointed as Termesehiadives of the special administration and began acting as special
7°. Subseq , in December 2012, Vi 1 i d two “mirrors” of the

Liaison Commission as special administrators whom, to date, continue to hold such positions®.

The Claimants also argue that the Liaison Commission has stated that its purpose is to assure the
compliance of the provisions of the special administration, while special administration members
have stated that their actions are aimed to promote the agri-food policies of the special
administration of the Executive Branch.*!

Finally, the Claimants state that Venezuela indefinitely suspended the expropriation
administrative proceeding while maintaining the special administration and the seizure measures
in an irregular and indefinite manner®. In such manner, Venezuela has progressively increased its
interference in the Companies without paying any compensation to the Claimants®.

2.  Respondent’s Position

The Respondent denies that the measures prior to Decree No. 7.394 and measures thereafter have
the relationship argued by the Claimants™.

First, the Respondent argues that the recitals of the Decree merely indicate the factual and legal
circumstances justifying the issuance of the Decree. The mention of the seizure measures in said
recitals is reasonable, inasmuch it reflects the reality of an existing judicial procedure as of the
date of the Decree which could affect the normal functioning and operation of Monaca®>.

 

Second, the R dent disputes the probative value of the of then President Chavez

— who, according to the Claimants, would have ordered the intervention, occupation and
expropriation of the Companies-, inasmuch from the video containing such statements presented
by the Claimants as evidence (i) it is impossible to be certain about the context of the statements;
(ii) it is concluded that these are eminently political and cannot be compared with a decision of
the Venezuelan State; and (iii) they do not have the content and effects attributed by the
Claimants®*.

134. Third, the Respondent denies that there is an identity between the Liaison Commission and the
special administration. On the contrary, it states that these are entities with different legal basis
and functions. The Respondent explains that the special administration is one of the judicial
measures ordered, which fulfills “a supervisory and custody task to safeguard the value of
companies”*®’, On other hand, the Liaison Commission was created within the framework of the
conversations related with the Decree No. 7.394 with the purpose of obtaining information and
knowledge to facilitate the transition after the termination of the expropriation process®.

135. The Respondent explains that both bodies should act with a certain degree of coordination to fulfill
their duties and to avoid duplicating efforts. However, it argues that this coordination responds to
the “logical collaboration between public officers” and does not evidence a “conspiracy theory” |
as argued by the Claimants®. In this sense, Venezuela states that the fact that both bodies have
followed the guidelines of the Ministry of Food does not demonstrate a merger of their functions,
since all companies in the food sector are obliged to meet the requirements of said entity™.
Additionally, it states that the Claimants base their thesis of the merger of these bodies on a draft
of an internal, which contains errors and was never used”'.

136. Finally, Venezuela argues that the Liaison Commission disappeared on September 30, 2013,
therefore it is not explained how the alleged expropriation effect, consisting in the occupation of
the companies, could have survived”.

137, In conclusion, Venezuela denies the alleged relationship argued by the Claimants between the
seizure and special administration measures, on the one hand, and Decree No. 7.394, on the other.
Venezuela argues that neither the first or the second have deprived the Claimants of their
ownership or control of the Companies nor have they voided their value. Thus, there is no
expropriation and no violation to the fair and equitable treatment standard under the BIT.

138. Venezuela presented several jurisdictional objections, three of them related to its denouncement
of the ICSID Convention, which, in its view, deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction to decide the
merits of this dispute.

139. In summary, Venezuela contended that (a) there is no formalized mutual consent to submit the
dispute to the ICSID since the Claimants were not authorized to formalize the consent before the
date of denouncement of the Convention by Venezuela (January 24, 2012), to the extent that the
jurisdictional conditions for formalizing the consent had not been met™; (b) the expropriation
claim did not exist as of the date of the notification and, inasmuch there is no valid expropriation
claim notice, such claim cannot be submitted to this arbitration®’; (c) Venezuela had ceased to be
a contracting State to the Convention at the time the Claimants submitted the dispute to ICSID
(May 10, 2013) and, therefore, the requirement of Article XI of the BIT requiring the States,
parties to the ICSID Convention, are parties thereof when the dispute is submitted to ICSID
arbitration, is not met”*; and (d) the Claimants do not comply with the nationality requirement
under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention since the true investor is Gruma, a Mexican company
that is not a national of a contracting State”.

140. Venezuela explained each of the aforesaid jurisdictional objections as summarized in the
following paragraphs.

141.

First, according to Venezuela, the Parties agree that the interpretation of Article 72 of the
Convention requires the formalization of mutual consent”. Article 71 of the ICSID Convention
allows contracting States to denounce the Convention and be released from any obligation to
continue complying with it, after six months of the denouncement date. On other hand, Article 72
of the Convention only preserves the right to initiate arbitration if the consent of the parties exists
before the effective date of denouncement of the ICSID Convention”. Likewise, Rule 2(3) of the
Institution Rules, along with its commentary (Note “M”) refer to the date of the granting of the
consent as the formalized mutual consent and relate it to Article 72 of the ICSID Convention".
The experts appointed by the Parties also agree that when the State has denounced the ICSID
Convention, the effective date to establish the existence of the formalized mutual consent, is the
date on which the depositary receives the notice of denunciation of the Convention'"'. In this case,
the effective date of denouncement of the Convention is January 24, 2012.

142. The Claimants did not formalize the consent to initiate an arbitration when presenting the Dispute
Notice dated November 7. 2011, and received on November 9, 2011 (the “Dispute Notice”)!".
Although these are prior to the effective date of the denouncement of the Agreement (January 24,

2012), the acceptance of the offer by the investor, acceptance which formalizes the consent, is
subject to the terms of the Treaty, including a series of pre-qualification requirements to choose
between local courts and international arbitration! .

In fact, while it is true that the Claimants filed the Dispute Notice on November 7, 2011, this
commenced the six-month period to try to amicably solve the dispute through negotiations’ and
such filing could not fulfill the purpose of formalizing the consent, inasmuch the jurisdictional
requirements established in Article XI of the BIT'® had not been met. Venezuela argues that the
alleged acceptance of consent by the Claimants of November 7, 2011 is invalid, and, therefore, is
legally non-existent'®.

Venezuela argues that pursuant to Article XI of the BIT, the contracting States agreed that the
following requirements should be met when a dispute arises: (i) the investor has notified the State,
in writing, about the existence of the dispute; (ii) the investor and the State have tried, to the extent
possible, to settle the dispute through an amicable agreement; (iii) the dispute could not have been
settled by an amicable agreement within a six month period as of the notification date!”’. The BIT
empowers the investor to choose to submit the dispute to local courts or to international
arbitration, only at the end of the above referenced procedure, and if each and every one of the
aforementioned requirements are met'®.

According to Venezuela “/t/he decision to submit the dispute to local courts or to an international
arbitration court necessarily implies that the investor cannot choose between one and the other,
until after the previous requirements have been met. It is only at that moment that the investor can
Sormalize the consent to an ICSID arbitration”. The Claimants would otherwise be choosing
the ICSID arbitration instead of the local courts before being authorized by the BIT to do so,
eliminating any useful effect to the mechanism of Article XI'!°.

Moreover, Venezuela argues that the requirement to attempt to amicably settle the dispute for a
six month period as of the notification date is a jurisdictional requirement!"'. Only if the dispute
cannot be amicably settled within such period, the investor may, at its discretion, submit the
dispute to the jurisdiction of the local courts or to international arbitration''?.

Venezuela refers to the opinion submitted in this arbitration by Professor August Reinisch, who
states that it is not a waiting period that is equivalent to the mere lapsing of time, but rather, it
refers to the need to participate in attempts to reach an amicable agreement''?. Venezuela further
alleges that ICSID tribunals have regularly accepted that the requirements such as those contained
in Article XI of the BIT are mandatory and condition the consent of the State, referring to Kilic v.

Turkmenistan, Daimler v. Argentina, Dede v. Romania, Tulip v. Turkey and Enron v. Argentina
(Decision on Jurisdiction)'*. Although some tribunals have considered that an amicable
settlement period is not a jurisdictional requirement, the aforementioned jurisprudence has been
disproved by more recent decisions''’. Furthermore, the language of Article XI of the BIT leaves
no doubt that these conditions are mandatory, and, therefore, have a jurisdictional nature''’.

148. According to Venezuela, the necessary consequence of the quoted jurisprudence is that the
consent can be formalized solely after the jurisdictional requirements have been met. Since in an
arbitration the tribunal’s power is based upon the parties’ agreement to submit the dispute to
arbitration, if the decision-maker has no power — i.c., jurisdiction - to decide the dispute, then the
consent is non-existent or legally ineffective''’. If an investor expresses its acceptance to an
arbitration offer before the conditions are met, the acceptance would be non-existent and the
investor's communication cannot have the legal effects sought by it''®, Venezuela argues that in
Holiday Inns v. Morocco the tribunal clarified that the consent was not granted on the date on
which the parties signed the arbitration agreement, but on the date on which the conditions were
finally met!"?,

149. The Respondent argues that, regardless of the fact that, to this date,there is no decision answering

, the question submitted to the Tribunal in this arbitration, “the general principle has direct

application: to the extent the jurisdictional requirements in the treaty have not been met, the

consent cannot be formalized’°, Furthermore, contrary to Claimants’ allegations, it is not

necessary for the BIT to include a different text in order for the requirements of Article XI to

condition the consent'?'. Venezuela also refutes the interpretation by the Claimants of Rule 2(3)

of the Institution Rules in this context, since at no time does it define when the investor has been

able to validly express his consent'??, When conditioned, consent is formalized only when the
requirements above have been met, and not when the other party expresses its consent”.

150. It is undisputed that the effective date to establish the exi: of the formalized mutual consent
is January 24, 2012 (notification date of the denouncement of the ICSID Convention by
Venezuela). The six-month period of negotiations set forth in Article XI of the BIT - one of the
jurisdictional requirements according to Venezuela - expired on May 8, 2012, three and a half
months after the effective date to formalize the consent. Consequently, the Claimants were never
authorized by the BIT to formalize the consent'™ and any attempt by the Claimants to formalize
the consent with respect to future disputes in their Dispute Notice is ineffective'”®,

 

151. Venezuela also argues that the principle of consent irrevocability set forth in Article 25(1) of the

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 41 of 375

ICSID Convention solely protects the formalized mutual consent, which did not exist in the
present dispute!?®, Moreover, Venezuela argues that it is not avoiding its international obligations
by demanding compliance with Article XI of the BIT. The Treaty provides for other alternatives
of international arbitration, so Venezuela would not evade its international obligations by avoiding
arbitration under the ICSID Convention'?’. Furthermore, if the Claimants’ logic were true as to
Venezuela’s intention to evade its obligations through its interp ion of the jurisdictional

qui Vv la would have d d the ICSID Cor ion in any of the 21 ICSID
arbitrations where it had been previously involved'8.

152. Now, therefore, with respect to future disputes, Venezuela states that the dispute did not exist,
much less its notification, nor did the other two requirements had been fulfilled before the
Claimants could be authorized to choose to submit the dispute to local courts or to international
arbitration'?®.

153. Second, Venezuela claims that no jurisdiction exists for the Tribunal to rule over the indirect
expropriation claim, insofar as such claim did not exist on January 24, 2012, the effective date of
denouncement of the ICSID Convention'**. The Dispute Notice was premature given that, as of
the date of its delivery, an administrative proceeding existed on its early stages, which, if finalized,
it would eventually have resulted in a direct expropriation'?!. In the Dispute Notice, the Claimants
made reference to Decree No. 7.394 and to the negotiations with Venezuela in connection with
such Decree. In accordance with the ordinary meaning of Article XI (1) of the BIT, a valid notice
of an expropriation claim assumes that the alleged breach by Venezuela existed prior to the date
notice!??,

154. Also, Claimants did not include an expropriation claim in their Request for Arbitration'>.
Claimants submitted claims under Articles III, 1V and VII of the BIT. Additionally, the Claimants’
reservation of rights indicates that the events that occurred until the date of the Request for
Arbitration, were not sufficient to substantiate an expropriation claim. The Administrative
Ordinance was only described as an aggravating event creating uncertainty, but not as the measure
that materialized in the expropriation".

155. According to Venezuela, the expropriation was mentioned for the first time in the Memorial, due
to the alleged breach of obligations under Article V of the BIT, using the Administrative
Ordinance as a justification thereof"*. The Claimants indicate January 21, 2013, as their valuation
date for their damages in this arbitration (“Valuation Date”)'*°, which is the date immediately
prior to the publication of the Administrative Ordinance dated January 22, 2013. The Claimants
alleged their loss of control on January 22, 2013, when Gruma would have been forced to stop

consolidating its operations in its financial statements'*’. Even the Claimants’ lawyers repeated at
the Hearing that the Administrative Ordinance was the tipping point in the expropriation iter
implemented by Venezuela!?8.

According to Venezuela, Claimants’ arguments are the best statement to indicate that the
cumulative events occurred before January 22, 2013, had not represented the loss of control of
Monaca and Demaseca. Therefore, a formalized consent on an expropriation claim could not have
existed. The dispute regarding an indirect expropriation did not exist on the effective date of
Venezuela’s denouncement of the ICSID Convention. Any arguments by the Claimants to
formalize the consent after such date cannot be used to grant jurisdiction to ICSID. Furthermore,
this dispute over the alleged total loss of control of Gruma over Monaca and Demaseca has not
been notified to Venezuela as required by Article XI(1) of the BIT’.

Venezuela also alleges that the lack of jurisdiction on the expropriation claim is evident because
there is no relationship between the seizure measures and Decree No. 7.394"?

Third, Venezuela claims that the BIT requires both States to be contracting States of the ICSID
Convention at the time an ICSID arbitration has begun.'*!. However, the Request for Arbitration
was filed on May 10, 2013, nine months after the denouncement became effective'4?. Under
Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, this dispute could not have been brought before a tribunal
under the ICSID Ci ion since V. la di d the ICSID C ion before it was
possible for the Claimants to formalize consent".

 

 

Article X1 (2)(b) of the BIT allows the investor to choose the ICSID arbitration to the extent that
“each State party to this Agreement is a party [to the Convention]"". If one of the States has not
joined the Convention, then an arbitration would solely be available under the rules of the
Supplementary Mechanism, and not under an arbitration as per the ICSID Convention".

Venezuela criticizes the Claimants’ argument which states that this clause implies that the ICSID
arbitration is available when both States party to the BIT have been contracting States of the
Convention, but it does not apply when a State party to the BIT is no longer a contracting State of
the Convention'**. Venezuela argues that this interpretation is groundless since Spain and
Venezuela had already joined the ICSID Convention when the BIT was signed by both States,
when it became effective, and because it would also eliminate the possibility of arbitration under
the ICSID Supplementary Mechanism'’. This statement of Article XI of the BIT can only be
construed as a requirement that each State shall be a contracting party of the ICSID Convention

so the dispute may be submitted to an ICSID arbitration when filing a Request for Arbitration'’.
Venezuela argues that this as an additional alternative grounds for the Tribunal to conclude that it
has no jurisdiction’. The Respondent argues that Article X1 (2)(b) of the BIT also includes as
international arbitration options, an arbitration under the Supplementary Mechanism of the ICSID
Supplementary Mechanism or under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission for
International Trade Law, (“UNCITRAL”). Therefore, there is no reason for the Claimants to insist
on maintaining an ICSID arbitration when there is no jurisdiction given the denouncement of the
ICSID Convention by Venezuela. Venezuela states that there are alternatives in the BIT to submit
disputes to an international arbitration after the ICSID Convention has been denounced!**.

161. Fourth, Venezuela states that the true investor in this arbitration is Gruma, a Mexican company
that has no right to benefit from the ICSID Convention, since it is not a national of a contracting
State of the Convention'*!.

162. Gruma, through the Claimants, wants to make the Tribunal believe that Valores and Consorcio
are investors in Venezuela and, therefore, the investments are Spanish'. The Claimants were
vehicles used to make Mexican investments look Spanish'**.

163. Venezuela claims that Valores and Consorcio are paper companies (which is confirmed by their
financial information) who could not have invested in Venezuela'®', Gruma was the sole
administrator of Monaca and Demaseca until 2014. In addition, the Claimants have no
employees, offices, telephone numbers or e-mail addresses'*’. The alleged attorneys-in-fact of the
Claimants, who ad: 1 the negotiations with Vi a, are Gruma empl 'S7, For example,

the Dispute Notice of Claimants had Gruma’s logo'’*. Venezuela refers to the definition of
investors under the BIT and argues that “despite the fact that the Claimants take for granted that
they meet the definition of Article 1.1 of the [BIT] to be considered as ‘investors’ and that this
would be sufficient to undergo an arbitration under the ICSID Convention, this as:
questionable™'.

 

 

   

164. Furthermore. even though the Claimants own the shares in Monaca and Demaseca', there is no
doubt that the investments were made by Gruma and not by the Claimants'®'. Gruma incorporated
Valores in Spain in 2003, and in 2004 it contributed 95% of its shares in Monaca. Gruma
incorporated Consorcio in 2006 and transferred to Consorcio the shares it had in Demaseca'®?.
Moreover, Gruma controls Valores and Consorcio from their date of incorporation. Engineer

Huerta confirmed that the board of directors of Valores and Consorcio have no activity in Spain
and that they only execute minutes as if they had been held in such country'®. Additionally, the
alleged investments of Valores in Monaca and of Consorcio in Demaseca, have not been

reality of this investment is evidenced by the intervention of the Mexican government in favour

165. Venezuela argues that the ICSID Convention exists for the Contracting States and their nationals,
but it does not exist for an improper use by companies such as Gruma, who is not a national of a
contracting State'®’, but rather a Mexican company. It was Gruma who authorized the
commencement of this arbitration under the ICSID Convention, as it evidenced by copies of
Gruma’s resolutions'**, This arbitration is unheard of since it is an ICSID arbitration initiated with
the authorization of a Mexican company'®. Venezuela thus concludes that “this arbitration has

tion of a legal entity that is not a national of a Contracting State, using

paper companies dully incorporated in Spain but without any employees and without a real
domicile in Spain, trying to invalidly formalize consent before been enabled by the Agreement to
do so, through a premature notice of a dispute with no grounds to substantiate an expropriation
claim, by initiating an ICSID arbitration when Venezuela was not a Contracting State to the
Convention, eventhough the Convention includes other options of international arbitration”'”°.

166. The scope and purpose of the ICSID Convention is to resolve differences between contracting
States and nationals of other contracting States!”!. Gruma is a Mexican company which cannot be
benefited from the Agreement and, therefore, has tried to do so through paper companies. The
compliance with the nationality requirement set forth in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is
has precedence over the “investor” term of the BIT. Additionally, to be a Spanish “investor”
protected under the BIT, the “investor” must be a Spanish “national” under Spanish law!”
However, the Claimants do not comply with the domicile requirements to be considered Spanish
nationals'”, Finally, Venezuela argues that accepting the jurisdiction under the conditions of this
case would have a negative impact on the ICSID arbitration system!™*.

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 45 of 375

ICSID has jurisdiction over the present dispute since all the conditions for the Center's jurisdiction
set forth in the ICSID Convention and in the BIT have been met.

 

Per Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention, the Center's jurisdiction is subject to three conditions:
(i) the dispute has a legal nature and directly arises from an investment (ratione materiae); (ii) the
claimant shall be a national of a contracting State and does not have the same nationality as the
other contracting State (ratione personae); and (iii) the parties have granted their consent to
submit the dispute to the Center (ratione voluntatis)'”>.

The Claimants maintain that in this case both ratione materiae jurisdiction conditions are met,
since there is a legal dispute between the Claimants and Venezuela, which arises from acts
affecting the Claimants’ investments, attributable to Venezuela '°.

Additionally, according to the Claimants, the ratione personae jurisdiction conditions are met.

Venezuela was a contracting State of the ICSID Convention when the Parties gave their consent
to submit this dispute to the ICSID jurisdiction'”’”. The ICSID Convention became effective on

June 1, 1995, for V The d itary received notification of the of the

Agreement on January 24, 2012, which became effective six months later, i.e., on July 25, 2012.

 

The consent of the Parties to ICSID jurisdiction was formalized on November 9, 2011, with the
Dispute Notice, prior to Venezuela notifying the denouncement of the Convention'’’. The
denouncement does not affect the obligations of Venezuela with respect to the dispute since the
Parties expressed their consent to submit this dispute to ICSID jurisdiction before the
denouncement was communicated to the depositary of the Convention'”. The latter is confirmed
by Article 72 of the ICSID C ntion. The sul 4 of the C ion by
Venezuela does not affect the rights and obligations arising from the consent previously granted
by Venezuela to the ICSID ju
in the BIT, which became effective as of September 10, 1997. On the other hand, the Claimants
granted their consent through the Dispute Notice received by Venezuela on November 9, 2011'*'.

 

iction'®’, Venezuela granted its consent to the ICSID jurisdiction

In the opinion of the Claimants, the conclusion of the waiting period set forth in the BIT, is not a
condition for the investor to accept Venezuela’s offer to submit the disputes to an ICSID
arbitration'®, In accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article XI of BIT, this rule
only establishes as a requirement to submit a dispute to arbitration, that the parties try to amicably
settle the dispute within a period of six months after the dispute notice,'**, This Article refers to
the submission of the dispute to arbitration, meaning, the authority to commence an arbitration.
Nothing prevents the investor from accepting Venezuela's offer to submit the dispute to ICSID
arbitration prior to the conclusion of the six-month waiting period'**. Venezuela’s offer in the BIT

solely ditions the i authority to (a) a litigation in the courts of Venezuela
or (b) an ICSID arbitration, whenthe following requirements are complied with: (i) that the
investor notifies Venezuela in writing of the existence of the dispute (ii) that to the extent possible,
Venezuela and the investor try to reachan amicablesettlement of the dispute, and (iii) that a six
month period elapses counted as of the notice date'*°. The conclusion of the waiting period does
not postpone the formalization of the consent, but it is rather a requirement that must be met to
commence arbitration'*.

173. The Claimants also argue that the attempt to unilaterally withdraw its consent after its written
accepntace by the Claimants, Venezuela breached Articles 25(1)(b) and 72 of the ICSID
Convention, which state that once consent is granted, neither party can, directly or indirectly,
withdraw it!®”,

174. The decisions quoted by Venezuela to support its argument on the nature of the waiting period are
inapplicable'**. Venezuela cites nine cases where the central argument was whether the claimants
could initiate an arbitration before complying with the requirements set forth in the investment
treaty. None of the decisions offered by Venezuela explain when its consent formalized if the
claimants accept the offer of consent before initiating the arbitration, nor do they explain if the
submission of the dispute to arbitration is conditioned by the offer to fulfillment of a waiting
period'®’, Even if the waiting period is considered to have a jurisdictional nature, it does not
determine the moment of consent and nothing prevents the waiting period requirement from being
fulfilled after the parties have consented to the jurisdiction of the ICSID'™.

175. According to the Claimants, none of the cases cited by Venezuela supports the argument stating
that the consent of the parties is invalid for being subject to a procedural requirement which must
be fulfilled before commencing the arbitration'®'. Venezuela relies on certain arbitration decisions
which refer to tial applicability requi of the ICSID C. ion, but which cannot be
compared with the requirements that must be fulfilled before commencing an arbitration’.

 

176. The Claimants refer to the arbitrations of Tokios Tokelés v. Ukraine and Abaclat v. Argentina to
argue that, in other arbitral decisions it has been accepted that an investor of a contracting state
can accept the consent offer of a treaty before the waiting period set forth in the treaty elapses'”>.

177. Furthermore, the Claimants are nationals of another contracting State pursuant to Article 25(2)(b)
of the ICSID Convention. Valores and Consorcio are Spanish because they are legal entities which
have been incorporated and exist under Spanish laws'"*, The ICSID Convention became effective
for Spain on September 17, 1994.

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 47 of 375

Pursuant to the investments definition under Article I(2) of the BIT, Valores and Consorcio would
be considered to have investments. There is no factual'’* or legal basis to support that the Tribunal
lacks jurisdiction because the real investor in this arbitration is Gruma, as Venezuela claims!"*.
Venezuela ignores the definition of “investor” in the BIT and tries to establish nationality
requirements in addition to those provided for in the Treaty, while ignoring the legal status of
Valores and Consorcio'”’. The incorporation of a legal entity under Spanish law is sufficient for
said legal entity to enjoy the protection of the BIT'’*. Arbitral tribunals have refused to ignore the
legal status of investors when the applicable treaties define the nationality of the investor with the
criterion of incorporation or formation'””. Furthermore, it is not true, as Venezuela alleges, that
Valores and Consorcio are not Spanish companies under Spanish law”. In any case, the definition
of investors of the Agreement, and not Spanish law, determines whether the nationality
requirements have been met in accordance with Article 25(2) (b) of the ICSID Convention”.

Furthermore, it is not true that Claimants have their administration and management center outside
in?”?, Both Valores and Consorcio submit their tax returns in Spain and comply with the
formalities set forth in Spanish laws’, Valores and Consorcio are entities holding foreign
securities (or holding companies), thus they require a reduced administrative structure and their
most relevant decisions are taken in Madrid by the respective management bodies. Venezuela’s
argument that the arbitration was initiated through a Gruma’s resolution” is also false.

 
 

The Claimants also argue that ratione voluntatis jurisdiction exists. Venezuela’s consent is
granted in Article XI of the BIT?”, and the requirements of Article XI are met in this case. Each
of the Claimants is a Spanish “investor” in accordance with Article I(1)(b) of the BIT. Their claims
arise from the breach by Venezuela of its obligations under the BIT.

The Claimants allege that on November 9, 2011, they notified in writing this dispute in accordance
with Article XI(1) of the BIT. In such communication, the Claimants informed Venezuela that a
dispute had arisen under the BIT “as a result of the measures [...] described, among others”. The
Claimants describe the dispute in detail, and invited Venezuela to hold conversations seeking an
amicable dispute resolution?”’. The Claimants made reference, among other measures, to “Decree
[No. 7.394], to the intervention measures imposed by the Republic on [the Companies], and to

7207

 

the failed attempts to find a negotiated dispute resolution

The Claimants also argue that the expropriation dispute existed long before Venezuela denounced
the ICSID Convention, and it was this dispute that the Claimants communicated to Venezuela in

the Dispute Notice?®. The Administrative Ordinance did not create a new controversy but,
instead, aggravated the existing controversy and culminated an expropriation proceeding that was
in the process of being executed when Venezucla denounced the ICSID Convention™. According
to the Claimants, there is sufficient evidence on the relationship between Decree No. 7.394 and
the Administrative Ordinance. It is a single controversy over the creeping expropriation of
Monaca and Demaseca, which was launched and began to be implemented years before Venezuela
denounced the Convention?"®. In addition, Decree No. 7.394 and the measures before and after it
are part of the same dispute?"

183. The dispute was duly notified as per the BIT?"”. In November 2011, the Claimants expressly
notified in writing their disagreement regarding the expropriation measures taken by Venezuela:

“On May 12, 2010, the Republic [...] published [...] the Presidential Decree
No. 7.394 [...] ordering the ‘forced acquisition’ and/or ‘expropriation’ of
[MONACA and DEMASECA]. [...]

Due to the Decree, in June 2010, the Republic created a Liaison Commission
to monitor the administration and operations of MONACA and DEMASECA.
The Republic has demanded that VALORES and CONSORCIO, through
MONACA and DEMASECA, pay the salaries and expenses of the current 20
(twenty) members of the Liaison Commission, which exceed US$1 million
per year. The members of the Liaison Commission, are located in the facilities
of MONACA and DEMASECA, and they use of the computers and offices of
MONACA and DEMASECA and, generally, hinder the free direction and
management of MONACA and DEMASECA by imposing controls and
authorizations for the management and payments of taxes, payrolls, purchases
of raw materials and suppliers in general, as well as by delaying the issuance
of the annual update certificates of the investments registries in Venezuela
prepared by the Investors and filed before the Foreign Investments Agency
(SIEX) in spite of complying with the applicable regulations, among others.
Due to Decree 7.394, MONACA and DEMASECA are unable, inter alia, to
pay royalties, repatriate capital and capital investments, as well as to send
profits abroad, and to make dispositions of assets outside their ordinary course
of business. For the same reasons, VALORES and CONSORCIO are
prevented, infer alia, from transferring their shares in MONACA and
DEMASECA to third parties. [...]

In accordance with the foregoing, and for the purposes of Article XI(1) of the
Convention, we respectfully inform You that the Investors consider that a
dispute regarding investments has arisen between the Republic and the
Investors as a result of, infer alia, the aforementioned measures, which
and are it patible with the obligations assumed by the Republi
in the Convention. Specifically, the mentioned measures contravene, inter
alia, the following obligations of the Republic set forth in the Convention: (i)
investments made in a Contracting Party’s territory by Investors of the other
Contracting Party shall not be subject to nationalizations, expropriations, or

any other measure of similar features or effects unless they are made
exclusively for reasons of public interest, in accordance with legal provisions,
and in a non-discriminatory manner and with a compensation paid to the
investor (Article V. Nationalization and expropriation) [...]

The Investors hereby, and for the purposes of the resolution of all the
previously mentioned disputes related to the investments, as well as all those
disputes which may arise in the future between the Investors and the Republic,
accept the consent granted by the Republic in the aforementioned Article XI,
and, in turn, the Investors express their consent to ICSID jurisdiction to resolve
such disputes through ICSID arbitration(s).” 2!

184, The Claimants contend that the term “dispute” is a “disagreement on a legal or factual matter, a
conflict of legal points of view or of interests between the parties” requiring a minimum of
communication, i.e., at least one of the parties must have raised the issue with the other party.”
214 The Claimants notified their “disagreement” on Venezuela’s measures in their Dispute Notice
, identified how the measures violated the BIT, and objected them months before Venezuela
denounced the ICSID Convention?!*.

185. If Venezuela’s argument were to be accepted, it would mean that Venezuela could evade its
international responsibility simply by denouncing the ICSID Convention and adopting a
subsequent measure that would aggravate the already notified dispute?'’. This interpretation
would negatively affect the fundamental principle of the ICSID Convention which states that the
consent of the Parties cannot be unilaterally withdrawn through direct or indirect means”"”, In the
Request for Arbitration, the Claimants expressly reserved the right to submit additional claims,
including an expropriation claim,?'* and in the Dispute Notice they granted their consent to ICSID
jurisdiction regarding disputes “which have arisen as well as all those disputes which may arise
in the future””". There is no doubt that consent to ICSID jurisdiction can refer to existing or future
disputes”°.

186. Venezuela’s argument stating that the Claimants could not have formalized the consent with
respect to the direct expropriation dispute, nor that they could have notified such dispute because
it did not exist when the Claimants sent their Dispute Notice, fails to acknowledge the facts and
should be rejected. The distinction Venezuela is trying to make between a dispute over a direct
and indirect expropriation is artificial and deficient since Venezuela had already stated, through a
Decree, that it would necessarily acquire Monaca and Demaseca and had taken measures to
indirectly achieve this purpose”!. There is no factual or legal basis for Venezuela’s argument that

a dispute exists and can be validly notified only when events supporting a claim of an indirect

expropriation exist. Venezuela did not cite cases supporting this position and argued to the

213 Claimants’ letter to the Executive Vice-president of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, November 7, 2011 (the “Dispute
Notice”) (Annex C-5) [emphasis added]. See Brief, 4 174.

contrary in the arbitration of Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela”.

187. Furthermore, neither the ICSID Convention nor the BIT require an existing dispute at the time of
formalizing the consent to ICSID*® arbitration, nor does the BIT require that the Claimants notify
each of the measures which form part of or which aggravate or continue, an already notified
dispute?”*.

188. There is no doubt that the dispute was notified on November 9, 201 1, when Venezuela had already
expressed its intention to appropriate Claimants’ investments and when it had adopted the vast
majority of measures to achieve such purpose. That notification is sufficient under Article XI of
the BIT and, therefore, it is irrelevant that the Dispute Notice did not make reference to the
Administrative Ordinance”®.

189. Likewise, according to the Claimants, the BIT does not require that both States, Venezuela and
Spain, be contracting states to the Convention at the time of commencement of an ICSID
arbitration”°, The Respondent argues that Article XI(2)(b) of the BIT allows the investor to
choose an arbitration before ICSID subject to the condition that “each State party to this
Agreement has joined [the Convention]" ””. However, the Claimants argue that Venezuela’s
reading of this Article is contrary to the ordinary meaning of the terms of the BIT, and that
Venezuela intends to add the following text to the BIT: “and when no Siate party has ceased to
beaCo ing State or has de d the ICSID Cc ion’, According to the text of the
BIT, the fact that a State has joined the ICSID Convention determines the application or not of
the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Supplementary Mechanism ”’. Article XI of the BIT makes
no reference to the eventual denouncement of the ICSID Convention by any of the States.

 

190. The interpretation of Venezuela is also contrary to the scope and purpose of the BIT and the ICSID
Convention, inasmuch, as explained by Professor Schreuer, such an interpretation would
eliminate the protection granted by Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, given that it would allow
States to evade their international obligations under the ICSID Convention through their simple
denouncement ?*°. The Claimants propose as an example, the Agreement between the Republic
of Venezuela and the Republic of Costa Rica for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of
Investments, executed on March 17, 1997, where such States expressly agreed that the ICSID
arbitration would not be available if the Respondent would have denounced the ICSID Convention
at the time an arbitration had commenced”!

191. Likewise, Venezuela is trying to confuse the offer made by Venezuela to submit the disputes
under the BIT, to ICSID arbitration (provided that Venezuela has joined the ICSID Convention),

with the submission of a dispute™*. The Claimants propose as an example Venoklim v. Venezuela,
where the tribunal concluded that the consent had been formalized before the denouncement of
the ICSID Convention became effective, rejecting the Respondent's objection, and mentioning
that the date on which the last of the parties granted its consent to ICSID arbitration “Js the
effective date as of when the consent consequences become effective”***. The consent of the Parties
was formalized on November 9, 2011, even before Venezuela denounced the ICSID Convention,
and when, at such time, Venezuela was still a contracting State of the ICSID Convention”,
Although Spain and Venezuela were already parties to the ICSID Convention when they signed
the BIT in 1995, Venezuela ignores that when the BIT was negotiated, Venezuela had not yet
ratified the ICSID Convention and there was no certainty that it would do so”.

The Claimants indubitably and unambiguously appointed the ICSID as the means for dispute
resolution’*®. Moreover, the Claimants have not submitted this dispute to the courts of Venezuela
nor have they agreed with Venezuela to submit the dispute to another dispute resolution
mechanism”.

c. ANALYSIS BY THE TRIBUNAL.

Below, the Tribunal will analyze each of the four objections presented by Venezuela, in the order
in which they were raised in its Counter Memorial. In analyzing each of these matters, the Tribunal
has considered all the arguments presented by the Parties, both written and oral. The fact that a
claim has not been quoted or summarized does not mean that it was not considered by the Tribunal
when reaching its decision. Specifically, the Court emphasizes that its conclusions are limited to
the requirements of this particular case and to the scope of the arguments presented by the Parties,

1. First jurisdictional objection

Venezuela argues that the Dispute Notice did not formalize, nor could it have formalized the
consent to ICSID arbitration since such consent is only formalized once all the requirements set
forth in Article XI of the BIT have been met. On the other hand, the Claimants argue that the
Parties had formalized their consent on November 9, 2011, upon receipt of the Notification of the
Dispute, prior to the denouncement notification of the Convention by Venezuela on January 24,
2012.

The Tribunal will first state the facts that are most relevant to the undisputed jurisdictional
objection of Venezuela invoked by the Parties:

(i) On November 9, 2011, Venezuela received the Dispute Notice.

(ii) On January 24, 2012, the ICSID Convention depositary received a written
denouncement notice of the Convention by Venezuela.

(iii) On May 9, 2012, the six-month period of Article XI(1) of the BIT, counted as of the
receipt of the Dispute Notice by Venezuela, concluded.

(iv) As of July 25, 2012, having complied with the six-month period set forth in Article
71 of the ICSID Convention, the denouncement of the ICSID Convention by Venezuela
became effective.

(v) On May 10, 2013 the Center received the Request for Arbitration.

196. The first jurisdictional objection of Venezuela is based on its interpretation of Article XI of the
BIT and Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention.

197. Article XI of the BIT establishes:

“1. Any dispute arising between an investor of one Contracting Party and the
other Contracting Party with respect to its compliance with the obligations set
forth in this Agreement shall be notified in writing, providing detail
information thereof, by the investor to the Contracting Party receiving the
investment. To the extent possible, the parties to the dispute will try to settle
these differences amicably.

2. If the dispute cannot be resolved in such manner within a six month period,
as of the date of the written notification referred to in paragraph |, it will be
submitted, at the investor’s choice:

a) To the competent courts of the Contracting Party in whose territory the
investment was made in, or

b) To the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)
created by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals or Other States, opened for its signature in Washington on
March 18, 1965, when each State party to this Agreement has joined it. In the
event that one of the Contracting Parties has not joined the aforementioned
Agreement, the Supplementary Mechanism for Conciliation, Arbitration and
Fact Finding shall be resorted to by the ICSID Secretariat;

3. If for any reason the arbitration bodies referred to in point 2 b) of this Article
are unavailable, or if both parties agree so, the dispute shall be submitted to an
ad hoc arbitration tribunal established pursuant to the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules [...]”*

198. Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention read, as follows:

“Article 71

Any Contracting State may denounce this Convention by written notice
to the depositary of this Convention. The denouncement shall take effect
six months after receipt of such notice.

Article 72
Notice by a Contracting State pursuant to Articles 70 or 71 shall not affect

the rights or obligations under this Convention of that State or of any of
its constituent subdivisions or agencies or of any national of that State
arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one of
them before such notice was received by the depositary”.

199. The Parties do not seem to dispute that, for interpreting the terms of the BIT and the ICSID
Convention, it is necessary to refer to the general rule of interpretation included in Article 31(1)
of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“Vienna Convention”) which establishes that
“fa] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given
to the terms of the treaty in their context and taking into account its scope and purpose”””. The
Tribunal considers that these elements of Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention form a single
rule of interpretation and should not be taken in isolation. The function of the Tribunal is to
determine the meaning of what was agreed in the BIT rather than establishing interpretation lines
applicable to other treaties with similar texts.

200. The Tribunal considers the description of the tribunal in Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia on the
interpretation process in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention:

 

“The interpretation provided in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention is a
process of concentric circles, in which the interpreter begins to consider,
within the framework of the, general rule 1) the ordinary meaning of the .
treaty’s terms, 2) in its context, and 3) in light of the scope and purpose of the
treaty, and going through such hermeneutic three steps path, it advances
towards the appropriate interpretation. [...]”24°

201. The Tribunal will rely on the general rule of treaty interpretation, and also on the complementary
tule provided in Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, insofar as it considers its application to be
necessary™*!

202. The Claimants and Venezuela seem to agree in an important part of the interpretation of Articles
71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention. Indeed, the Respondent argues, and the Claimants seem to
accept, that Article 72 of the Convention applies if the mutual consent to ICSID jurisdiction is
formalized before the d of the C 242. The di ion of the Parties focuses
on whether, in this case, the mutual consent to the ICSID jurisdiction was formalized before the
denouncement of the Convention.

203. The Claimants argue that the consent of the Parties was formalized through the Dispute Notice,
received on November 9, 2011, where they expressly stated that “Zhe Investors hereby accept the
consent granted by the Republic in the aforementioned Article XI, and, in turn, the Investors
express their consent to ICSID jurisdiction to resolve such disputes through ICSID
arbitration(s)"**. Such Dispute Notice was sent before the denouncement of the ICSID
Convention by Venezuela, on January 24, 2012. Although the Respondent does not agree that the
Dispute Notice formalized the consent, it does not deny that the Claimants’ intention was precisely

239 The Tribunal notes that Venezuela is not a party to the Vienna Convention. However, it is a peaceful fact that the interpretation
rules set forth in such Convention, reflect the international law and, as already mentioned, the Parties do not dispute that these
rules apply for interpreting the Treaty.

to grant their consent to ICSID arbitration.

204. The Parties agree on the three steps that must be sequentially followed according to Article XI of
the BIT: (i) the written notification of the existence of the dispute delivered by the investor; (ii)
that the investor and the host State attempt to amicably settle the dispute; and (iii) a six months
period elapses as of the notification date without reaching an agreement”.

205. However, supported by the expert opinions of Professors Christoph Schreuer (the Claimants) and
August Reinisch (the Respondent), the Parties discuss whether the consent by the investor can be
granted in step (i) or only when steps (i), (ii) and (iii) have concluded™*. The Respondent argues
that it is only after the three requirements have been met, that the BIT “authorizes the investor to
choose between submitting the dispute to the competent courts of the host State or to an
international arbitration” *6.

206. Professor Schreuer and Professor Reinisch agree that the BIT imposes as a requirement that the
investor negotiate during six months as of the date of the Dispute Notice, before the investor can
submit the corresponding claim before the national or arbitral jurisdiction. Their discrepancy
refers to the time when the investor can opt for the arbitration forum and formalize their consent
to arbitration.

207. According to Professor Schreuer, Claimants could opt for arbitration at any time, even before the
commencement of the six-month negotiation period in the BIT™’. On other hand, Professor
Reinisch considers that the Claimants could not opt for arbitration, at which time they would grant
their consent, until they had exhausted the six months of negotiations set forth in the BIT?®.

208. In summary, for Venezuela, the Claimants did not formalize the consent with the Dispute Notice
since, in accordance with Article XI of the BIT, solely once the dispute is notified and after the
six months period is exhausted, the investor can grant its consent and submit the dispute to the
chosen forum. According to Venezuela, the text of Article XI(2) of the BIT, specifically the
expression “will be submitted, at the investor’s choice”, shows that only after the amicably
negotiation period has elapsed, the investor's choice can be made with respect to the dispute’s
forum.

209. Venezuela understands that the requirement to attempt to amicably settle the dispute within a six
month period has a jurisdictional nature.

210. The Tribunal accepts that it is a complex matter, in which each position is supported by the opinion
of well-known international law experts on foreign investments, and after a careful analysis has
concluded that, in the circumstances of the specific case and in light of the arguments presented
by the Parties, it does not agree with Venezuela’s interpretation of Article XI of the BIT.

211. In the first place, the ordinary meaning of the terms in the BIT in its context does not condition
the possibility of the investor granting its consent to the fulfillment of the three previous stages.

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 55 of 375

The Treaty solely states that once the six-month stage has been exhausted, a dispute may be
“submitted” to “the investor’s choice” to arbitration or to the courts of the hosting State. The
Treaty does not require that the consent to arbitration ICSID and the submission of the dispute be
given through the same document.

212. It does not follow from the text of the BIT, nor does it conceptually result from its context, that
the investor’s right to consent to ICSID arbitration must be equated with the investor’s right to
“submit” the dispute to national courts or to international arbitration upon the investor’s election.
The submission of the dispute is the first procedural step triggering the forum the investor has
chosen. The Parties agree that, in the case at hand, the submission of the dispute occurred with
the submission of the Request for Arbitration.

213. The Parties do not seem to dispute that, upon signing the BIT, Venezuela granted its consent to
arbitration (Article XI of the BIT)”. With respect to the consent of the investor, the text of Article
XI does not subject it to any condition. If item 2 of Article XI contains a condition, it could only
refer to the submission of the dispute, i.e., at the commencement of the procedure before the local
courts or before the arbitral tribunal.

214. Similarly, nothing in the text suggests that such a choice can solely be made after the negotiation
period has expired.

215. In fact, Article XI of BIT refers to the dispute notification:

“1. Any dispute arising between an investor of one Contracting Party and the
other Contracting Party with respect to its compliance with the obligations set
forth in this Agreement shall be notified in writing, providing detail
information thereof, by the investor to the Contracting Party receiving the
investment. To the extent possible, the parties to the dispute will try to settle
these differences amicably.

2. If the dispute cannot be resolved in such manner within a six months period,
as of the date of the written notification referred to in paragraph 1, it will be
submitted, at the investor’s choice”. [emphasis added] .

216. The Tribunal considers that the text does not refer - as appears to be inferred from Venezuela’s
interpretation - that, only after six months have elapsed, the investor can make his forum election.
The reference to “the” investor’s choice means a specific choice: “at the investor’s choice”, which
could be both, a choice made after six months, and an election - the choice - made prior to that
period. Once the “choice” is made, the dispute shall be submitted to the dispute resolution
mechanism chosen by the investor, provided that six months have elapsed since the Dispute
Notice without the parties having been able to amicably settle the dispute.

217. The States parties to BIT granted to the investors of the other party with the authority, in Article
XI of the BIT, to choose to submit themselves to the national courts of the host State of the
investment or to international arbitration. For the Tribunal, the terms and context of Article X1(2)
do not imply that the election can solely be made at the time of submitting the dispute to
arbitration. The investor is free to exercise this right under the terms of the BIT and nothing
prevents the investor from making such election in advance.

218. The Tribunal considers that with the Dispute Notice, the Claimants granted their consent to ICSID
jurisdiction. In the case at hand, the Claimants also made their election on the mechanisms offered
by Venezuela in Article X1(2) of the BIT.

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 56 of 375

219. Generally, the text of the BIT allows an investor to notify a dispute, that the investor and the State
party to the BIT attempt to amicably settle the dispute within a six months period, and that, after
this period, the investor, for through the same act, grants its consent to ICSID arbitration and
submits the dispute, at the investor’s choice, to national courts or investment arbitration. However,
the Tribunal does not agree with Venezuela that Article XI of the BIT, which allows the consent
and submission of the dispute to be simultaneous, imposes the obligation that said consent and
submission of the dispute to ICSID arbitration, have simultaneous effects.

 

The Tribunal does not find in the text or in the context of the BIT a provision prohibiting or
limiting the possibility for the investor, at the time of the dispute notification, to grant its consent
and opt for the arbitration forum. In the opinion of the Tribunal, the expression of the BIT,
according to which the parties should try to amicably settle the dispute “fo the extent possible”,
does not suggest that the negotiations are a prerequisite for the validity of the consent.

 

 

Finally, an interpretation such as the one proposed by Venezuela could promote, as Professor
Schreuer points out, an eventual unfair behavior from the States and a violation of their
international commitments. Once the controversy has been notified and knowing the need to
exhaust the six-month period for the investor to express its consent, the State could denounce the
Convention to escape from its comaniiments,

222. For the Tribunal, there is no doubt that the three steps identified by the Parties**' and
aforementioned were met. The Claimants submitted a written notification of the existence of a
dispute with Venezuela, the Parties tried to amicably settle the dispute and the six months period
before the Claimants submitted the dispute to arbitration, i.e., before the procedure commenced
with the submission of the Request for Arbitration. To the extent that the BIT did not subject the
formalization of the consent to conditions precedent, which in the case at hand, the consent was
granted with the Dispute Notice and that the requirements were met before submitting the dispute,
the arguments of the Respondent do not prosper.

 

223. Finally, with respect to the cases mentioned by Venezuela in reference to the waiting period and
to the fact of whether such period has a jurisdictional or procedural nature, the Tribunal agrees
with Professor Schreuer's conclusion,” establishing that this difference between the Parties is not
relevant, inasmuch that the period was actually observed and the Parties conducted negotiations
to try to reach an agreement before submitting the dispute to international arbitration by
submitting the Request for Arbitration.

224. The Tribunal then rejects Vi ’s first juri: el insofar as V la gave its
consent to ICSID jurisdiction in Article XI of the BIT, which became effective as of September
10, 1997, and the Claimants validly granted their consent in the Dispute Notice received on
November 9, 2011. There was mutual consent by the Parties prior to Venezuela’s denouncement
of the ICSID Convention and, therefore, such denouncement does not affect the jurisdiction of
this Tribunal.

2. Second jurisdictional objection

225. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the indirect expropriation claim

for two different independent reasons”. First, Venezuela alleges that “te Claimants could not
have formalized the consent on an indirect expropriation claim which did not exist prior to the
denouncement of the Convention by the Republic” **. The Respondent alleges that, according to
the arguments of the Claimants themselves, the dispute over the indirect expropriation could not
have existed until January 22, 2013, the publication date of the Administrative Ordinance which,
according to the Claimants, crystallized the alleged expropriation’®> . The Respondent warns that
on the date of receipt of the Dispute Notice (November 9, 2011) and on the date of denouncement
of the Agreement by Venezuela (January 24, 2012), "events that could support a claim of indirect
expropriation were not present at the time.”?5° Therefore, it concludes that the Dispute Notice was
premature and, consequently, invalid with respect to the expropriation claim?*”

226. Second, Venezuela argues that “the controversy over the alleged total loss of control by GRUMA
on MONACA and DEMASECA - which the Claimants argue in their Memorial that it constitutes
an indirect expropriation - has not been notified to the Republic as required by the Article X11 of
the Agreement.”*** To the extent that there had been no notification regarding the Administrative
Ordinance and its effects, then, the six-month negotiation period provided for in the Treaty would
not have commenced either’*’.

227. On other hand, the Claimants argue that the Administrative Ordinance did not generate a new
dispute, but that it rather (i) aggravated a dispute which existed as of the publication of Decree
No. 7.394 in May 2010, and (ii) concluded an expropriation process that had begun with such
Decree and was in process of being executed when the Respondent denounced the Convention”.
In such sense, the Claimants argue that they have no obligation to notify each measure adopted
by Venezuela solely having as purpose aggravating or continuing an already notified existent
dispute**'.

228. The Tribunal will successively analyze Venezuela's arguments supporting this objection to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

229, The Tribunal has already concluded that the Claimants consented to ICSID jurisdiction through
the Dispute Notice. Therefore, the first question that the Court must answer in connection with
this second jurisdictional objection is whether the consent granted through said notification covers
the indirect expropriation claim filed by the Claimants in this arbitration.

“Any dispute arising between an investor of one Contracting Party and the
other Contracting Party with respect to its compliance with the obligations set
forth in this Agreement shall be notified in writing, providing detail
information thereof, by the investor to the Contracting Party receiving the
investment. To the extent possible, the parties to the dispute will try to settle
these differences amicably.” [emphasis added]

231. In accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms, Article XI(1) of BIT requires (i) the
existence of a dispute and (ii) that the dispute should be over the compliance of the obligations by
the State receiving the investment under the Treaty. A dispute is “disagreement on a legal or
factual matter, a conflict of legal points of view or of interests between the parties.”” As Professor
Schreuer observes, the existence of a dispute requires, at least, that one of the parties has raised
the issue with the other party”,

232. In the Dispute Notice, the Claimants referred, inter alia, to the effects of Decree No. 7.394, the
acts carried out by the Liaison Commission, the imposition of controls and authorizations in the
management of the companies, and the delay in the issuance of the annual update of the investment
register before the Foreign Investments Agency (SIEX)™. The Claimants also stated that they:
were unable to pay royalties, repatriate capital and investment income, send profits abroad, carry
out an asset disposal outside their ordinary course of business and transfer their shares in Monaca
and Demaseca to third parties”®.

233.

a

Consequently, the Claimants reported that a dispute with Venezuela arose as a result, inter alia,
of the measures and actions described in the Dispute Notice, and that said measures, and that such
actions contravened Article V of BIT, relating to expropriation’. In such respect, the Dispute
Notice establishes:

“[I]n accordance with the foregoing, and for the purposes of Article XI(1) of
the Agreement, we respectfully inform You that the Investors consider that a
dispute_regarding investments has arisen between the Republic _and_ the
Investors as_a result of. inter alia, the aforementioned measures, which
and are it patible with the obligations assumed by the Republi
in the Agreement. Specifically, the aforementioned measures contravene, inter
alia, the following obligations of the Republic set forth in the Agreement: (i)
investments in the territory of a Contracting Party made by Investors of the
other Contracting Party shall not be subject to nationalizations, expropriations.

or_any other measure of similar features or effects unless they are made
exclusively for reasons of public interest, in accordance with legal provisions,
and in a non-discriminatory manner and with a compensation paid to the
investor (Article V. Nationalization and expropriation)” [emphasis added]

234. According to the Respondent, the notification claim for the breach of obligations under the BIT
with respect to the expropriation is invalid i hV a had not breached its obligati
under the Treaty*”. The Respondent alleges that “/sJolely after the expropriation occurred, and
only if the requirements of Article V are not met [...] a breach by the Republic to its obligations
under the Agreement which could be subject to a Dispute Notice, could exist” **, The Tribunal
does not agree with this statement: the notification referred to in Article XI(1) of BIT refers to the
existence of a “dispute” — i.e., a disagreement on a point of law or fact - regarding to compliance
with Treaty obligations.

 

235. Whether or not there was a breach of the BIT, including Article V — expropriation - of the Treaty,
is precisely the subject of the dispute and, therefore, a matter submitted to the Tribunal’s decision.
From the content of the Dispute Notice, it follows that, at least since November 9, 2011, a dispute
existed between the Parties with respect to the alleged breach of Respondent’s obligations under

_ the Treaty with respect to expropriation issues,

236. Now, therefore, the Respondent suggests that the Administrative Ordinance caused an
expropriation dispute different than the one arising from Decree No. 7.3947, Venezuela’s
position seems to be based on the fact that the Claimants “tried to notify a direct expropriation in
their Dispute Notice" based on the publication of the Decree No. 7.394”, and it was until they
filed their Memorial that, for the first time, they presented a claim for an indirect expropriation
that would have been triggered with the publication of the Administrative Ordinance on January
22, 201377!

237. However, there is nothing in the Dispute Notice supporting this conclusion. The Claimants
expressly stated that the measures described in the Dispute Notice are contrary to Venezuela’s
obligations under Article V of the BIT which refers, both, to direct expropriations and to “any
other measure of similar features or effects” to an expropriation. Neither the Claimants qualify
the expropriation as direct or indirect, nor does it follow from the text of the Dispute Notice that
their intention was to qualify the measures as a direct expropriation.

238. Furthermore, the circumstances referred to by the Claimants in their Dispute Notice - interference
in the management of Monaca and Demaseca, the impossibility of paying royalties, repatriating
capital and disposing their shares in the Companies, inter alia - are the same as, according to them
pursuant to their writs submitted to this Tribunal, they amount to an indirect expropriation of their
investments in Venezuela. In other words, the alleged effects of the Venezuela’s measures and
actions, which were expressly denounced by the Claimants in their Dispute Notice, are essentially
the same as those discussed during the arbitration.

239. The Claimants have attributed these effects mainly to Decree No. 7.394 and to the seizure and
special administration measures. In effect, the position held by the Claimants in this arbitration is
that through a series of measures - including Decree No. 7.394 and the actions carried out by the
Liaison Commission, inter alia - the State has submitted its investments to an indirect and
progressive expropriation Juding with the publication of the Administrative O:

 

240. One part of the dispute that has been submitted to the Tribunal is precisely wien Decree No.
7.394, the seizure and special i and the Admini: are
related or not in the terms indicated by the Claimants. Also, the dispute lies in ve such
measures caused a loss of economic benefits or the investment control equivalent to an
expropriation. The Parties dispute the effects of the Administrative Ordinance and its relationship
with Decree No. 7.394 and with the measures described by the Claimants in their Dispute Notice.
The Claimants argue, in part, as a measure which concluded in the expropriation process””? and
as Venezuela’s decision which aggravated an existing dispute since the publication of Decree No.
7.394 in May 20107”. Venezuela denies the effects the Claimants attribute to the Administrative
Ordinance and denies their connection with the Decree No. 7.394 and the measures derived from
it to which the Claimants attribute expropriation effects.

241. With respect to the Administrative Ordinance, the Tribunal could only accept the jurisdictional
exception proposed by Venezuela if it were clear that a second dispute was generated from the
measures arising from the criminal proceedings. As it will be explained in further detail below,
the Tribunal has found that the seizure and special administration measures on the Companies,
whose foundation is the alleged Participation of Mr. Fernandez Barrueco in the capital of Monaca
and De were d by V lan officials in ion with the purpose being
pursued and the provisions of Decree No. 7.394 and those arising from Venezuela’s food
policies’. During the term of the Liaison Commission at the Monaca and Demaseca facilities,
there was convergence and confusion between the functions of the Liaison Commission members
and those exercised by the special administrators. Even after the withdrawal of the Liaison
Commission and when the special administrators were the only remaining at Monaca and
Demaseca facilities, there was no clarity as to the origin of the decisions made by the Respondent’s
officials, as to whether they were based on the seizure and special administration measures, the
Decree No. 7.394 or the compulsory acquisition process. Furthermore, the Liaison Commission
members created in the framework of the compulsory acquisition process, were then appointed as
special admini: in the Admini oO The Tribunal that there has
been a de facto relationship between Decree No. 7.394 and the seizure and special administration
measures, including the Administrative Ordinance, and that they are all part of the same dispute
notified by the Claimants in their Dispute Notice.

 

242. It is undisputed that, as of the date on which the Claimants expressed their consent to arbitration,
the Administrative Ordinance, a consequence of this criminal proceeding, had not been issued. If
the Administrative Ordinance is part of the same dispute and the Claimants could not have known
it on the date of their consent - since it had not been issued - the Claimants could not be required
to include it in the notice. They could not have been required to notify each new measure related
with the dispute, nor to initiate a new negotiation period to commence the arbitration.

243. The Tribunal finds that the expropriation dispute existed at least as of November 9, 2011. In its
Dispute Notice, the Claimants validly notified the existence of a dispute regarding compliance of
Venezuela’s obligations under Article V of the Treaty and, in turn, they formalized the consent to
arbitration with respect to the case at hand in relation to the expropriation prior to the

denouncement of the Treaty by Venezuela. Therefore, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the
expropriation claim in the terms set forth by the Claimants in this arbitration.

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal rejects the second jurisdictional objection of Venezuela.

The Respondent argues that, regardless of the effects of the application of Article 72 of the
Convention, the BIT requires that both States - Spain and Venezuela - be contracting States of the
Convention at the time the investor submits the dispute to ICSID arbitration’”*. Such requirement
would not be met in this case, because by the time the Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration
(May 10, 2013), six months had already elapsed since the denouncement notification (January 24,
2012) and, therefore, Venezuela had ceased to be a contracting State of the ICSID Convention?”®.

The third jurisdictional objection by Venezuela is based on its interpretation of Article XI(2)(b)

as of the date of the written notification referred to in paragraph 1, it will be

The Respondent argues that Spain and Venezuela were contracting States to the ICSID
Convention before signing the BIT. Therefore, the interpretation of Article XI(2)(b) proposed by
the Claimants - according to which what it is required that both States have initially adhered to
the Convention - would deprive the meaning and utility of this provision. Furthermore, this
interpretation would eliminate the possibility of commencing an arbitration under the
Supplementary Mechanism of the ICSID when the ICSID arbitration is unavailable?”’.

the ordinary meaning of the terms of the Treaty in its context and considering its scope and
purpose, as required by Article 31 of the Vienna Convention.

250. In international law, “join” is one of the acts through which a State may grant its consent to be
bound by a treaty””. The Tribunal considers that the term “joined it” in Article X1(2)(b) of the
BIT should be understood, in a broad sense, as having granted the consent to become a contracting
State to the ICSID Convention”.

 

251. R dent’s interpretation would imply equating the expression “when each State party to this
Agr eement has joined the {ICSID Convention]” [emphasis added] with the expression “if each
State party to this Agreement is a party to the ICSID Convention”. Being a party of a treaty means
having expressed consent to be bound by it. “Accession” is an act by which the State manifests
such consent; being a party to the treaty is the consequence of that accession. Thus, these are
different concepts which cannot simply be exchanged in the context of Article XI of the Treaty,
as proposed by Venezuela.

 

252. Likewise, V 1 rpretation would imply ing that the expression "/i] n the event
that one of the Contracting Parties has not joined it" refers to the event in which one of the States
has denounced the ICSID Convention. In the opinion of the Tribunal, these expressions are not,
and cannot be, equivalent. “Accession” and “denouncment” are different acts, with different
objectives and opposite effects, and are regulated by different rules within the Vienna Convention.
Even, as Professor Schreuer observes, they are diametrically opposed”*'. Therefore, the
transcribed text cannot have the meaning attributed to it by Venezuela.

253. The context of the term “joined” confirms Claimants’ interpretation, according to which the
requirement is that both States have initially acceded to the Convention. For the Tribunal, Article
XI(2)(b) contemplates two hypotheses: the first is that both States have become parties to the
Convention, in which case the arbitration will be available under the ICSID Convention. The
second hypothesis is that one of the States has not become a party to the Convention. In this case,
arbitration may be resorted to, under the Supplemental Mechanism of the ICSID.

254. The tense used in Article XI(2)(b) of the BIT, i.e., “has joined ” implies that accession occurs at
a single moment when the State Party expresses its consent to be bound by the ICSID Convention
and, consequently, it becomes a contracting State thereof.

255. The Tribunal agrees with the explanation presented in the arbitration by Professor Schreuer:
pursuant to Article XI(2)(b), if a State has joined or not to the ICSID Convention, it determines
whether arbitration is available under the ICSID Convention or the Supplemental Mechanism of

280 The Tribunal notes that Venezuela signed the ICSID Convention on August 18, 1993, that it deposited its ratification instrument

on May 2, 1995, and that the Convention became effective for Venezuela as of June 1, 1995,

the ICSID?®. If none of these two mechanisms were available, then the dispute would be
submitted to an ad hoc tribunal under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

256. The Tribunal finds that the interpretation of Article XI(2)(b) set forth herein is consistent with the
object and purpose of the Treaty, and the Respondent has not convincingly argued otherwise.

257. Furthermore, Article 32 of the Vienna Convention indicates that the interpreter may resort to
supplementary interpretation methods, among other purposes, to “confirm the meaning resulting
Srom the application of Article 31”. Within the supplementary interpretation methods, Article 32
of the Vienna C i pressly includes the ci of the ion of the treaty.
Both, Claimants and Professor Schreuer, have referred to the circumstances of the BIT negotiation
to explain why Article X1(2)(b) of the BIT was drafted in that way despite the fact that, at the time
of its execution, both Spain and Venezuela were already parties of the ICSID Convention.

 

258. The explanation offered by the Claimants - which has not been contested by the Respondent -
confirms the Tribunal’s interp ion. The BIT iati d in approxi ‘ly January
1995.28 By that time, Venezuela had signed the ICSID Convention, but had not yet ratified it. In
effect, Venezuela signed the ICSID Convention in August 1993, but ratified it almost two years
later, in May 1995. The ICSID Convention became effective, with respect to Venezuela, on June
1, 1995. By the time Venezuela ratified the ICSID Convention, the BIT had already been
negotiated and Spain was in the middle of an internal approval process of the Treaty in order to
sign i?®,

ro)

In this context, it makes sense that Spain and Venezuela had negotiated a dispute resolution system
that provided for one of the States not being party to the ICSID Convention. This is precisely the
second hypothesis of Article XI(2)(b), according to which the Supplemental Mechanism would
be resorted in case one of the States “has not joined” to the ICSID Convention.

260. Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that Article X1(2)(b) cannot be interpreted as
requiring both States to be parties of, or, according to the Respondent, “continue to be joined” to
the Convention at the moment in which the investor submits the dispute to ICSID arbitration. This
interpretation would be contrary to the ordinary meaning of the terms of the Treaty and would
ignore the context and the circumstances of its negotiation and execution.

261.

In the case at hand, the consent to the ICSID jurisdiction was formalized before Venezuela
denounced the ICSID Convention. The BIT does not impose an additional requirement that both
States parties to the BIT should continue to be parties to the ICSID Convention at the time the
investor submits a dispute to an ICSID tribunal.

262. For the aforementioned reasons, the Tribunal rejects the third jurisdictional objection of the
Respondent.

263. The Respondent alleges that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction, inasmuch the true investor in
Venezuela is Gruma, a Mexican company which has no right to benefit from the ICSID
Convention because it is not a national of a contracting State.

264. Venezuela bases this objection on two main arguments. First, it argues that the Claimants are
paper companies acting as holding companies of the Gruma shares in the Companies to give a
Spanish apr to the i A ding to V la, the Claimants merely

“inherited direct foreign investment” from Grama through a transfer of “paper” shares*®°.

265. Second, the Respondent argues that even if the Claimants qualified as “investors” under the
definition of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, they could not be considered nationals of another
contracting State for purposes of the ICSID Convention’’’. According to Venezuela, “being a
‘Spanish investor’ under the Agreement is not automatically equivalent to being a ‘national’
Spanish to comply with the requirement to be 'a national of another contracting State! of Article
25 of the ICSID Convention.” *** Claimants must also qualify as nationals from Spain under
Spanish law; however, they do not meet the requirements to do so”*”.

 

 

266. For methodological reasons, the Tribunal will begin its analysis with this second argument.

267. Inaccordance with Article 25(1) of the Convention, the ratione personae jurisdiction of the ICSID
extends to disputes between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State:

 

“[T]he jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent
subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Center by that
State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the
dispute consent in writing to submit to the Center. When the parties have given
their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.” [emphasis
added]

268. Further, Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention establishes what is meant by “a national of another
Contracting State”:

“[A]ny juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other
than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented
to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person
which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that
date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be
treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this
Convention.” [emphasis added]

269. Article 25(2)(b) contains two hypotheses to determine whether a juridical person constitutes a
“national of another Contracting State” for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the Convention. The
first hypothesis is that the juridical person has the nationality of a Contracting State other than the
State receiving the investment. The second hypothesis admits that the juridical person has the
same nationality of the State receiving the investment, provided that the parties have agreed to
attribute the status of “national of another Contracting State” inasmuch it is subject to foreign

control.

270. In the second hypothesis, “foreign control” is the criterion for establishing the nationality to be
attributed to a juridical person under the Convention when it already has the nationality of the
receiving State. In contrast, in the first hypothesis - which is relevant for purposes of this
arbitration - the Convention does not establish any criteria to determine that a juridical person has
the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State receiving the investment. Therefore, this
task corresponds to the States.

271.

As noted by several ICSID tribunals, the drafters of the Convention chose not to incorporate a
definition of nationality under Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, granting wide latitude to States
to agree on the criteria that would determine the nationality of legal persons for purposes of ICSID
jurisdiction”

272. In this regard, the Rompetrol court v. Romania indicated that

“The latitude granted to define nationality for purposes of Article 25 must be
at its greatest in the context of corporate nationality under a BIT, where, by
definition, it is the Contracting Parties to the BIT themselves, having under
international law the sole power to determine national status under their own
law, who decide by mutual and reciprocal agreement which persons or entities
will be treated as their ‘nationals’ for the purposes of enjoying the benefits the
BIT is intended to confer” *"'

273. The Tribunal agrees with the reasoning of the Rompetrol court v. Romania. Article 25 (2)(b) does
not define the manner of determining the nationality of legal persons for the purposes of Article
25 of the Convention. Therefore, it is up to the States to establish the requirements that a legal
person must meet to consider that it has "the nationality of a Contracting State other than the
State party to the dispute". Gi ly, the States establish these i in the i
that contain the offer of consent to the jurisdiction of the ICSID. When entering into international
agreements for the protection of investments, it is the States that, in exercise of their sovereignty,
negotiate and agree to which natural or legal persons will grant the benefits of the agreement.
Consequently, the Tribunal must grant deference to the definition of nationality of legal persons
established in the corresponding agreement.

 

274. Inthe words of Professor Schreuer:

“[T}he definitions of corporate nationality included in national laws or treaties
providing ICSID jurisdiction are directly relevant to determining whether the
nationality requirements of Article 25(2)(b) have been met. They are part of
the legal framework for submission to the Center by the State. Upon written
acceptance of the investor, they become part of the consent agreement of the
parties. Therefore, any reasonable determination of the nationality of legal
persons contained in national laws or treaties must be accepted by ICSID
commissions or tribunals”?

275. For the aforementioned reasons, the Tribunal finds that the definition of “investor” established in
the BIT is conclusive for purposes of establishing its jurisdiction under the Treaty and under the
Convention. The definition of the investor’s nationality is given by the Treaty. In this case, the

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 66 of 375

BIT requires the Claimants to be incorporated under the laws of Spain, a matter that is not subject
to controversy between the Parties. Therefore, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to analyze
Spanish law in order to verify whether or not the Claimants have the nationality of that country,
in accordance to additional criteria as to those established in the Treaty.

Article XI(1) of the BIT, which contains the offer of the State's consent to arbitration, provides as
follows:

“Any dispute arising between an investor of one Contracting Party and the
other Contracting Party with respect to its compliance with the obligations set
forth this Agreement, shall be notified in writing, providing detailed
information thereof, by the investor to the Contracting Party receiving the
investment. To the extent possible, the parties to the dispute will try to settle
these differences amicably.” [emphasis added]

 

 

The term “investor” is defined in Article I(1) of the BIT, which reads as follows:

 

“[Legal] persons, including companies, joint ventures, business corporations,
branches and other organizations incorporated or, in any event, duly organized

pursuant to the laws of the Contracting State, as well as those incorporated in
one of the Contracting Parties and are effectively controlled by the investors

of the other Contracting Party.” [emphasis added]

 

In the case of legal entities incorporated outside of Venezuela, Article I(1)(b) of the BIT
establishes as the on/y requirement to determine whether entities are investors under the Treaty is
for them to be incorporated or duly organized under Spanish law. In other words, the BIT adopts
the incorporation criterion to establish whether a legal person qualifies as an “investor” under the
Treaty.

This Tribunal finds that, within the framework of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, the
Contracting States may adopt the incorporation criterion under their own law as a necessary and
sufficient nationality criterion for purposes of the ICSID jurisdiction?”®. As other courts have
observed, the place of incorporation is a criterion widely used at the international level to establish
the nationality of legal persons and, together with the criterion of the registered office, is the
generally accepted method for determining the corporate nationality of the claiming party under
Article 25 (2)(b)?™.

In exercising their authority to define consent to ICSID jurisdiction, States may, for example,
establish a control or “effective connection” test of the investor with the other State, or reserve
the right to deny protection to claimants that they could otherwise resort to the respective treaty.
However, once consent is defined, the Tribunal shall follow it’. Therefore, when the nationality
test established in the corresponding treaty is that of “incorporation” - and not one of genuine
control or connection, for example - the court should not go beyond the provisions of the treaty,
unless that some form of abuse has occurred””*, for example, if the investor is a company
incorporated in a particular State after the dispute arose, in order to benefit from a treaty concluded
by that State’”’.

In this case, it is duly proven - and, in any case, it is undisputed by the Parties - that Valores and
Consorcio are business corporations incorporated in Spain**. Similarly, is it also undisputed by
the Parties that the “shares” are investments protected under the BIT and that the Claimants have
owned the shares in Monaca and Demaseca for several years before the controversy arose”*’.

The Respondent has not invoked any reason that justifies disregarding the legal status of the
Claimants or investigating the fulfillment of the nationality requirements in furtherance to those
expressly established in Article XI(1)(b) of the BIT. The Tribunal also finds no reason to do so.

As explained by the Tribunal, the “incorporation” criterion established in the BIT is the only
relevant and sufficient criterion to establish its ratione personae jurisdiction, and the Claimants
comply with that requirement. Therefore, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to evaluate the factual
allegations raised by the Respondent in connection with this jurisdictional objection.

In conclusion, this Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimants under Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention and Article XI(1) of the Treaty. Thus, the fourth jurisdictional objection presented by
Venezuela is rejected.

BIT VIOLATION CLAIMS
A. EXPROPIATION CLAIM
1. Claimants’ Position

The Claimants argue that Venezuela expropriated its investments in violation of Article V of the
BIT. Specifically, they claim that the measures imposed by Venezuela on Monaca and Demaseca
constitute “measure/s] of similar features or effects” to an expropriation in terms of Article V(1)
of the BIT, i.e., constituting an indirect expropriation.

In this case, the expropriation would have occurred progressively through a series of measures
that, cumulatively, have features and effects equivalent to an expropriation**'. These measures
are: (i) the imposition of seizure and special administration measures on Monaca and Demaseca
derived from the criminal proceedings, vis-a-vis Mr. Fernandez Barrueco; (ii) the issuance of
Decree No. 7.394 - whose effects extend to Demaseca - and the “invasion” of the company
facilities by the Liaison Commission members who, acting on their own behalf or jointly with the
special administrators, they would have begun to gradually control the companies; and (iii) the
issuance of the Administrative Ordinance granting the special administrators — previously [the]
Liaison Commission members - the “broadest administrative authorities” on both Companies and,
in addition, orders them to adjust their actions to the agri-food policies of Venezuela and present
financial statements of its management at the close of each fiscal year.

According to the Claimants, the Administrative Ordinance constitutes the “culminating point ofa
series of measures attributable to the Respondent interfering with Claimants’ property rights with

such intensity that they ‘have no content and shall be considered expropriated’ These
successive measures would have substantially deprived Claimants of the use, enjoyment that any
investor would expect to have on their investments‘.

288. The Claimants argue that indirect expropriation requires a “substantial deprivation” of the
economic benefits of the investment*®. Following the standard proposed by the AES v. Hungria
tribunal, there would be expropriation when (a) the investor is totally or significantly deprived of
the ownership or effective control of its investment or (b) the investment is totally or significantly
deprived of its value®®. In this case, both hypotheses would concur since, as a consequence of the
measures imposed by Venezuela, the Claimants (i) have lost the control over the Companies and
(ii) the value of their shares is “virtually zero”,

289. First, the Claimants argue that the Venezuelan State, acting through several entities and agencies,
has exerted an interference of such magnitude on the Companies that it has substantially deprived
them of the control on their investments*®. This interference would have resulted in an effective
deprivation of the fundamental rights of the Claimants as shareholders of the Companies in a
manner that “has been deprived from its essence, and lacks content to the point that they are
practically useless"®.

290. According to the Claimants, the following situations would reflect the substantial loss of control
of the Claimants on their investments, as recognized by several international tribunals*!°.

291.

First, the loss of de iure control over Monaca and Demaseca arising from the Administrative
Ordinance granting the special administrators “the broadest administration authorities” over the
Companies and, furthermore, obliging them to adjust their actions to public policies issued by the
Ministry of Food with respect to agri food activity*"'.

292. Based on several decisions of the Iran-USA Claims Tribunal, the Claimants state that “the
of g dministrators in a can be idered as a measure of
similar ‘features or effects to the indirect expropriation.’ 312 As in those cases, the Claimants argue
that in the case at hand there is no realistic perspective of revering their rights. In effect, the
measures have been in force for more than six years, there are no indications that they will cease

and, at any moment, Venezuela will acquire the formal ownership of the Companies?!?.

293. Second, the impossibility of (i) distributing or receiving dividends and transferring capital; (ii)
freely dispose their shares; (iii) appoint new board members; (iv) approve balance sheets and
financial statements; (v) decide on the sale of assets; and (vi) amend or modify the bylaws of the
Companies. According to the Claimants, these restrictions arise from the prohibition of notarizing
or certifying acts whereby Monaca, Demaseca or the Claimants participate, and the freeze of the
bank accounts of the Companies*'*. The distribution of dividends would also be hampered by the
SIEX rejection - presumably ordered by the Liaison Commission- to update Monaca’s registry as

a foreign investment?!.

Third, the limitations on property rights imposed through Decree No. 7.394, The Claimants argue
that Decree No. 7.394 remains in force with all its effects, including the restriction on transferring
the assets of the Companies?!*. The Respondent would have admitted that closing plants without
state authorization would entail a violation of the Decree, while the special administrators would
have declared that, by virtue of said Decree, the assets of the Companies cannot be subject to any
negotiation*!”.

Fourth, the interference in the daily decisions of the Companies reflected, e.g., the need to request
authorization from Venezuelan officials to make any payment or transfer of their bank accounts
and in the obstruction of certain commercial decisions*"*.

Fifth, the duty to submit periodic reports to the Liaison Commission and special administrators
on financial, commercial and operational matters of the Companies*!°.

Sixth, the obligation to pay fees and compensations to the Liaison Commission members and
special administrators.

Seventh, the occupation of different offices and spaces in the administrative headquarters and
other facilities of Monaca and Demaseca by the .Liaison Commission and the special
administrators".

Eighth, the disposal of the Companies assets, particularly the obligation to lend thousands of tons
of corn to competing companies without accruing interest and selling corn flour to the so-called
“Socialist Bakeries”,

Ninth, the restriction on appointing representatives in judicial matters, authority which, pursuant
to the law, corresponds to the board of directors of Monaca. According to the Claimants, this
limitation was confirmed by the Attorney General’s Office, which, in the context of a judicial
proceeding, vis-d-vis, Monaca, stated that the company has an “intervening board” which may
exercise the defense of the company in the proceeding”.

Tenth, the fact that the Companies are under a special administration regime which, under
Venezuelan law, solely applies to confiscated assets that have become the State’s property.
According to the Claimants, Venezuela has acted as if the Companies were its property; it has
imposed special administrators acting as their owners and has referred to them publicly as
“recovered and nationalized” companies, “acquired by the Venezuelan State”>**. The Claimants
emphasize that the highest court of administrative litigation confirmed that it had jurisdiction over
Monaca because it is a company in which the State exercises “decisive and permanent control

with respect to its management or administration”.

302. Second, the Claimants argue that, in furtherance of to having been stripped the control of the
Companies, the measures imposed by Venezuela have had the effect of destroying the value of
their investments. Following the decision in Tecmed v, Mexico, the Claimants explain that the
measures adopted by a State constitute indirect expropriation if, in such regard, the investor “was
radically deprived of the economic utility of its investment, as if the rights related to such
investments [...] would have ceased”,

303. In this regard, the Claimants first state that Decree No. 7.394 covers all of the Companies’ assets
and it is uncertain when the transfer of ownership over said assets will be formalized’; and,
second, that the Companies are under an intervention regime preventing them from receiving the
“basic benefits” from their investments.

304. Specifically, the Claimants state that they cannot perform the following acts with respect to the
Companies: (i) register the minutes of the shareholders’ meeting in the Commercial Registry; (ii)
effectively appoint board members; (iii) distribute dividends; (iv) manage the payment of
premiums for the subscription of shares; (v) sell or transfer their equity interests; (vi) manage and
withdrawn from their bank accounts; (vii) freely manage transfer their assets; and (viii) freely
manage them according to their criteria®”®. Furthermore, the Venezuelan measures have had the
effect of subj the of the Cr to the ii ions of the special administrators
subject to civil and criminal penalties in the event of a non-compliance’.

305. Consequently, the actions by the Claimants in the Companies would have no economic value,
since the Claimants, or a hypothetical buyer in their place, cannot enjoy the rights and benefits
inherent to this type of investment*°. This conclusion is based on three main reasons: (i) during
more than five years, the Companies have been prevented from distributing profits and there are
no indications that such prohibition will be lifted in the mid-term; (ii) the fact that the Companies
must adjust their actions to Venezuela’s food policies limits their ability to generate profits and
make investment decisions maximizing their net present value, since the special administrators
have the authority to impose measures on the Companies affecting their ability to generate funds;
and (iii) since the publication of Decree No. 7.934, and as a result thereof, the Claimants, or a
potential buyer, are certain that at any time the ability to receive the future dividends flows will
be formally transferred to the Respondent®>'.

306. Claimants emphasize that a company prevented from paying dividends or profits to its
shareholders has no value for them or for a potential buyer. In this regard, they emphasize, first,
that the shareholders have not received the payment corresponding to the share subscription
premium decreed in December 2008, as representatives of Venezuela prevent Monaca from
obtaining the record of direct investment which is necessary for making the payment. The
foregoing would evidence that the Claimants have been deprived from receiving the payment of
approved profits and that decreeing more profits would be useless**. Second, they explain that
the “short-term assets” of the Companies are assets subject to the Decree No. 7.394 and,
consequently, Claimants cannot transfer them without authorization from Venezuela. The
argument of the Respondent stating that there is no restriction for Companies to declare dividends
is tricky, since it is not the same to have a loan to receive a dividend in an uncertain future, than

to receive the dividend itself >>>, Third, the Claimants indicate that paying dividends would alter
the assets of the Company, which is prohibited by Decree No. 7.934 and the seizure and special
administration measures. Furthermore, the accounts of the Companies are frozen and withdrawls
could only be made with the authorization of the special administrators. According to the
Claimants, “it would be naive to believe that they would authorize the Claimants to make
millionaire payments of dividends.” >“ Finally, they state that, for the payment of dividends, the
Venezuelan law requires the presentation of a certified copy of the meetings’ minutes approving
such payment. As the registration of the act is prohibited, the dividends approvals could not be
paid?>,

307. Finally, the Claimants indicate that Venezuela’s argument that Companies cannot have a zero
value inasmuch they exist, continue to operate and are profitable and have a surplus, is irrelevant,
inasmuch “companies continue to operate, but for the benefit of the Republic - not for the benefit
of their formal shareholders’*°, In effect, Claimants cannot receive dividends from their
investments in the Companies and all the assets and rights subject to Decree No. 7.934, including
financial assets, “will be transferred, free of encumbrances or limitations in favor of the
Republic’,

308. Third, the Claimants argue that the measures adopted by Venezuela are permanent and not merely
temporary, as the Respondent argues.

309. On the one hand, they claim that Decree No. 7.934 has permanent and irreversible effects,
inasmuch it affects all of the Company’s assets and obliges its owners to transfer, on a definitive
manner, said assets to Venezuela and it, likewise, obliges Venezuela to acquire them™*. The
Claimants state that Respondent’s argument that Decree No. 7.394 is not irreversible given that
the process is suspended for the parties to negotiate an amicably settlement is fallacious,
inasmuch, on the one hand, the negotiations have not continued and, for the other, the suspension
of the expropriation process does not imply the cessation of the effects of the Decree*”,

310. Likewise, they also note that Venezuela’s analysis of the dissolution of the Liaison Commission
is superficial, since it fails to mention that two of its main members are special administrators
under the Administrative Ordinance and continue to exercise essentially the same functions which
they performed in the Liaison Commission™°,

311. On the other hand, the Claimants argue that “the extensive duration of the seizure and special
administration measures and the state of the appeal filed, vis-a-vis, said measures demonstrate
that the measures adopted by the Republic are not temporary”™". The Claimants argue that the
doctrine izes that the ive duration of the is a factor the
of an indirect expropriation”. According to the Claimants, a measure ceases to be temporary
when an objective observer would conclude that there is no immediate possibility for the owner
to recover the enjoyment of its investments™>.

transient or temporary, inasmuch (i) the Respondent implemented the special administration in
December 2009, after President Chavez ordered the occupation of the companies allegedly owned
by Mr. Fernandez Barrueco “to convert them into socialist companies”; (ii) the legal basis of the
special administration over the Companies (Article 22 of the Ley contra la Delincuencia
Organizada) applies to seized or confiscated property, which, under Venezuelan law, means that
such property has become the State’s property; (iii) several state officials and entities have
confirmed that the Companies “were acquired by the State”, “are owned by the Bolivarian
Government” and were “recovered”; and (iv) Venezuela has preserved the measures in an
irregular manner and has even refused to decide whether or not to accept the appeal filed more
than four years ago by the Claimants, vis-a-vis, the decision confirming said measures, and there
is no evidence to reasonably conclude that the appeal will be resolved in the short or mid-term™4.

313. Contrary to Venezuela’s arguments, the Claimants state that, if it is concluded that they did not
include an expropriation claim in their Request for Arbitration, this does not constitute an
admission or recognition regarding the non-existence of an expropriation*>. The argument of the
Respondent undermines the nature and function of the reservation of rights, insofar it would lead
to the conclusion that its effect is to preclude a claim, instead of preserving it™*

314. In any event, the Claimants note that (i) they formally notified the existence of an expropriation
claim under Article V of the BIT from their Dispute Notice, and (ii) in April 2013, also prior to
the Request for Arbitration, Gruma publicly announce the de-consolidation of the Companies”.
operations as a result of the Administrative Ordinance™’. According to the Claimants, the
foregoing evidences that: (i) the measures adopted by Venezuela did have “sufficient grounds” to
be presented in the arbitration; (ii) there was already an expropriation claim formally notified
under the BIT, and (iii) the Claimants reserved the right to file such claim later as they did in
fact™*’,

315. Finally, the Claimants argue that Venezuela not only indirectly expropriated its investments, but
that it has also subjected them to an illegal expropriation process“. According to the Claimants,
the expropriation of their investments is illegal under the BIT inasmuch (i) it was made without
compensating the Claimants; (ii) it was contrary to the legal provisions governing expropriation
under Venezuelan law, and (iii) it was discriminatory*®.

316. With respect to the first point, the Claimants state that, in the event of expropriation, the BIT
demands the payment of a prompt, adequate and effective compensation. It also establishes that
the compensation must be “equivalent to the real value of the investment immediately before the
measures were taken or before they were announced or published, if this occurs prior [to the
expropriation.]"*5' According to the Claimants, “the real value of the investment” referred to by
the BIT is equivalent to its fair market value*”.

317. Although it has been more than five years since Venezuela issued Decree No. 7.934 and imposed
the seizure and special admii ion the R dent has not ip d the
Claimants in any manner, nor has it paid the fair market value of the Companies nor has it offered

thereof***. This lack of payment, by itself, makes the expropriation carried out by Venezuela,
illegal.

318. The Claimants point out that Respondent's argument, according to which the existence of a
negotiation process would comply with the requirement of legality, ignores the fact that Venezuela
has repeatedly hampered the Claimants' attempts to resolve the dispute and has preferred to
maintain the status quo instead of negotiating in good faith, thus avoiding having to pay
compensation to the Claimants***,

319. According to the Claimants, the facts would show that Venezuela has not had a real will to
negotiate an amicable settlement regarding the expropriation of the Companies and has even acted
in bad faith throughout the process**. Particularly, the fact that the Respondent ignored all the
sale proposals made by the Claimants as per Venezucla’s request, and that the latter would have
never submitted a counterproposal and it would have not made an offer based on an available
valuation for more than three years. Therefore, it would be valid to conclude that Respondent has
not negotiated in good faith, in accordance with the standards followed by the tribunals of
ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela and Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela’®’.

With respect to the second point, the Claimants allege that under Venezuelan law the State cannot
occupy the assets of the company subject to expropriation without first obtaining a final judgment
from a competent judge and paying a fair compensation thereof **. Respondent contravened this
provision by imposing the Liaison Commission - which, contrary to Venezuela’s arguments, was
never agreed by Claimants - and the special administration over the Companies*”. They also argue
that the expropriation process was unilaterally suspended by Venezuela to maintain the sfatus quo
in an irregular and indefinite manner, to Claimants’ detriment*®. In this regard, they argue that
although the Venezuelan law does not establish a term for the direct settlement phase, it cannot
be used to “indefinitely perpetuate” an injurious status of Claimants’ property rights**'.

321. With respect to the third point, the Claimants argue that the expropriation was discriminatory
inasmuch Venezuela has treated other food companies similar to the Companies ina different way
- including Alimentos Polar, C.A. and Cargill Venezuela, C.A.- who also compete in the
Venezuelan wheat and corn flour market. In fact, the Venezuelan State has not issued an
expropriation decree with respect to such companies obligating them to forcefully sell all of their
assets - but only a few of their assets - for the execution of the “Socialist Agroindustrial Processing
Capacity Consolidation for the Venezuela of the XXI century ~ program or any other public
program™, On the contrary, the Respondent has benefited other companies to the detriment of
the Companies by ordering Monaca and Demaseca to transfer corn to them**,

322. Finally, and contrary to Venezuela's arguments, the Claimants affirm that any violation of the
Venezuelan legal system regarding expropriation constitutes, in turn, a violation of the BIT*™
Likewise. they also state that the Treaty does not require exhausting domestic remedies or filing

claims before domestic courts. In this case, the Claimants opted to resort to an ICSID arbitration,
inasmuch going to the Venezuelan courts would be useless, as evidenced by the third-party
proceeding (incidente de tercerias®.

323. In summary, the Claimants allege that Venezuela progressively expropriated its investments in
the Companies through a series of permanent and irreversible measures which had the effect of
depriving control of the Claimants on their investments and destroying their value. Moreover, this
expropriation measures are illegal since they do not comply with the requirements set forth in the
BIT.

2. Respondent's position

324. The Respondent denies that there has been a direct or indirect expropriation of Claimants’
investments. On the contrary, it maintains that the owners of Monaca and Demaseca hold the
ownership and control of the Companies and that the corresponding measures have not caused a
significant reduction or loss in the value of their investments*®,

325. As an introductory manner, Venezuela states that the Claimants intentionally confuse the

expropriation p dure initiated by V la - which was suspended before the expropriation
took effect -, on one hand, and the measures adopted in the context of the criminal proceeding,
vis-a-vis, Mr. Fernandez Barrueco - which are of a precautionary and temporary nature.-, on the
other*’, However, these are completely different and independent procedures and none of them
has resulted in expropriation®,

 

326. dent also i Claimants’ that the Administrative Ordi was the
culminating point of the alleged creeping expropriation. The Administrative Ordinance was issued
before the Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration. Therefore, the Claimants should have
included an expropriation claim in their Request for Arbitration; however, they did not. On the
contrary, the Claimants reserved the right to submit additional claims in the event that Venezuela
“otherwise seizes the investments of the Claimants, or takes or continues to take interference
measures on such investments”®. The foregoing would evidence the lack of support for the
expropriation claim now argued by the Claimants.

327. According to Venezuela, the Claimants have not evidenced that an expropriation occurred on their
respective investments, inasmuch the measures: (i) are not permanent nor have irreversible
consequences; (ii) they have neither resulted in the deprivation of their property, nor in the total
reduction of the value of their investment, nor in the loss of control of their investment; and (iii)
cumulatively and gradually have not led to the effective denial of the owner’s interest on its
property3”

328. First, Respondent argues that, for the invoked measures to constitute expropriation, they must be
definitive and ig to none of the alleged by the
Claimants meet such ees,

proceeding, vis-a-vis, Fernandez Barrueco are precautionary measures which, by definition, are
provisional and temporary. It also explains that the seizure measures follow the fate of the criminal
process, and could be modified, revoked or annulled by the competent authority motu proprio or
at per the request of the interested party>”?.

330. With respect to the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal cases cited by the Claimants, Venezuela
notes that these cases are substantially different from the case at hand, given that in those cases,
the government administration was established by law to replace the administrators and there was
no realistic perspective of investors regaining control of their investment?”>.

331. Regarding the duration of the measures, the Respondent states that the Court must consider the
circumstances of the case at hand. In this case, the Court must consider that the measures issued
by the criminal judge (i) are reasonable and procedurally justified; (ii) they directly depend on the
fate of the criminal process; (iii) its control is in charge of an independent judicial authority, and
(iv) the reasonableness of its duration must be analyzed in the context of the Venezuelan judicial
system and with respect to its objective of protecting [Venezuela] against organized crime and
terrorism?”*.

332. With respect to Decree No. 7.394, Venezuela alleges that the Liaison Commission, established
within the framework of the expropriation process, was also FeINpOATY, as confirmed by. the fact
that it was dissolved in September 2013°7°.

333. Second, Venezuela asserts that the Claimants have not evidenced that the measures have reached
the high investment threshold established by the law and jurisprudence to demonstrate that they
have an expropriation effect?”*.

334. According to Venezuela, international jurisprudence agrees that “a measure amounts to an
expropriation if the claimant was substantially or radically deprived from the economic use and
enjoyment of its investments or if its investment has been effectively neutralized, in whole or in its
entirety”*”’. In that sense, the Claimants must evidence that the measure destroyed either all or
practically all, the economic value of the investment, or interfered with or limited it to such a
degree as to conclude that the property was taken from the owner’’®.

335. In such regard, Venezuela argues that the mere decrease in the value of the investment or of the
profits is insufficient to support the existence of an indirect expropriation*”. Similarly, there
would be no expropriation if, despite experiencing a decrease in profits, the company’s business
remains operational*®. It also states that for the loss of control of an investment to be considered
an expropriation, the investor should not be allowed to use or dispose of his investment**'.

336. Inthis case, the Claimants have neither proved that their shares have lost all their value as a result

of the adopted by V nor that a “hyp ical voluntary buyer” would grant a
zero value to the shares**,

Venezuela denies that the seizure measures have caused a loss of Claimants’ rights as shareholders
of the Companies; and it argues that, even if there had been a loss of rights and benefits, this would
not entail the total loss of the shares’ value***.

338. In effect, the Claimants have not even proved that the measures have had a negative impact or
have diminished the value of their investment. On the contrary, as of 2010 the utilization levels
of the Companies increased, to the point that, to the Valuation Date, their performance was higher
than they had before the implementation of Decree No. 7.394 and the seizure and special
administration measures**, Likewise, in its 2012 Annual Report, Gruma acknowledged not
having identified any indication of impairment in the value of its net investment in the Companies,
so that even a decrease in the value of the investment would be ruled out.

339. Venezuela notes that the Claimants have not evidenced that they have been deprived of the
economic benefit of their investment. On the contrary, the Companies have remained operative
and ongoing, and continue to produce profits which have been used in the ordinary course of
business**.

340. With respect to the reasons that, according to the Claimants, would lead to the conclusion that
their shares in the Companies have no value, Venezuela states the following:

 

341. First, it is untrue that Decree No. 7.394 prevents the distribution of dividends in the Companies.
The Decree only concerns to the necessary goods for the production, storage and distribution of
food and, hence, excludes the profits that corporate governance bodies would have allocated for
other purposes**’. Regarding the alleged restriction to carry out corporate acts arising from the
seizure measures, Venezuela notes that the Claimants have not requested authorization from a
judge for the registration of certain acts nor they object that such possibility exists. Similarly, the
Claimants have failed to demonstrate that the failure to register a specific act “would have
prevented the execution of their eventual resolution to distribute dividena

Second, it is “more than evident” that a company dedicated to the production of food in Venezuela
shall comply with the country’s food policies, which is why the Claimants argument stating that
the Companies’ ability to generate profits, investing or divesting in a manner maximizing its net
present value would be limited for this reason should be disregarded**’. In this regard, the
Respondent refers to the Ley de Seguridad y Soberania Agroalimentaria.

Third, expropriation process is suspended to allow the Parties to seek a consensual solution, other
than expropriation, so it is untrue that the goods and rights subject to Decree No. 7.394 would
necessarily be transferred to the Respondent’s assets as a result of the process*”.

 

344. Finally, Venezuela indicates that the Claimants have not evidenced that the Venezuelan State has
received any benefit or profits from the Companies, so their argument stating that the companies

are still in operation, but for the benefit of the Respondent, is groundless*'.

345. Respondent also denies that the Claimants have lost control on their investment. It argues that, on
the contrary, they have always maintained the daily management and control of the Companies,
which continue producing and distributing their products’.

346. Specifically, Venezuela asserts that the Claimants have not established, for each of the facts
allegedly demonstrating that they have lost control over the Companies, “if such interference [in
business activities] is sufficiently restrictive to support the conclusion that the property has been
‘taken’ from its owner", In this regard, Venezuela explains the following:

347. First, the special administrators have not taken out Claimants’ control over the Companies, they
have not replaced the administration and management of the Companies, they have not interfered
with the Companies’ operations or displaced the Claimants from their Companies. Shareholder
position. On the contrary, the Companies’ representatives have kept their offices and no action
taken by, or attributable to, Venezuela has ignored or prevented the statutory bodies of the
Companies from exercising their functions™.

348. The special administration has conservatory and temporary administration, supervisory and
custody features to prevent corporate assets from unduly deteriorating. None of the resolutions by
means of which the special administrators have been appointed, including the Administrative
Ordinance, have granted them management or administration authorities over the Companies*”>.

349. Furthermore, the Claimants have not indicated “not even] a single case in which the special
administrators have undertaken management authorities or have unauthorized management acts
carried out by the managers appointed by Gruma; thus, it can be said that the statutory bodies
have remained per or have been comp p r d to 1g foreign
decisions”***,

 

350. Second, it is not true that, in consequence of the seizure measures, the Claimants would not have
been able to freely transfer their shares, receive dividends, appoint new board members, approve
balance sheets and financial statements, decide on the sale of assets or amend the Companies’
bylaws**”,

 

351. No legal provision or judicial or administrative order, including Decree No. 7.394 nor the seizure
measures, has prohibited or prevented the performance of the corporate acts referred to by the
Claimants. In fact, the acts not contrary, vis-a-vis, the objective of preserving the integrity of the
Companies’ estate, should not be understood included within the prohibition to transfer assets
subject to registration; and, in any case, the interested party may request authorization from the
judge who issued the measure in order carry out such acts.

352. In the case at hand, the Claimants have not evidenced the existence of corporate acts whose
effectiveness would have been limited by the seizure measures and have not evidenced that any
request for judicial authorization to register or certify a specific act had been submitted and
denied*”. Specifically, Venezuela emphasizes that the Claimants have not evidenced that they
had attempted to declare and distribute dividends nor to request a judicial authorization to register

Third, it is untrue that the special administration is an institution exclusively applicable to property
that, due to seizure or confiscation, has become the State’s property. In Venezuela, the criminal
judge has broad powers to issue complementary precautionary measures that best meet the
security objective pursued. It was in use of these powers that the judge decided to apply the of the
special administration figure to the Companies, without implying that there was property seizure
or confiscation”.

354. Fourth, it is also untrue that the Liaison Commission and the administrators had invaded or
occupied the offices and facilities of the Companies. The Liaison Commission has used the offices
with Gruma’s consent and the special administrators never had a permanent physical presence at

the Companies’ plants“°’. Expropriation by “occupation” occurs when the State substitutes,

replaces or physically expels the owner of the property to which it was the owner; which situation

has not occurred in the case at hand".

355. Respondent also establishes that, almost two years after the alleged occupation, Gruma stated the
following in its Annual Report, dated April 30, 2012:

“The Venezuelan government has not taken physica! control on MONACA’s
or DEMASECA’s assets, nor has it taken control of their operations.
Consequently, GRUMA can validly and legally affirm that, to date, Valores
Mundiales and Consorcio Andino have full legal ownership over the rights,
interests, shares and assets of MONACA and DEMASECA, respectively, and
that they also have complete control on all types of decisions, operations and
directives in [the Companies]” “°°.

356. Fifth, the requests for information made by the Liaison Commission and the administrators have
been necessary for these agencies to perform their duties, and do not constitute or imply a loss of
control’,

 

Sixth, the redirection of corn is legally permitted for agri-food safety reasons; it is also done
between private companies and is a common practice in the industry”.

358. Seventh, the payment of fees to the Liaison Commission members was agreed with Monaca’s
and their pensation was made in di with V lan law. Further,
the special administrators receive an amount in bolivars from Monaca as a right (diera), different
from the one indicated by Engr. Huerta'®’.

359. In summary, Venezuela argues that neither the seizure measures arising from the criminal
proceedings, vis Fernandez Barrueco nor the activities deployed by the Liaison Commission
under Decree No. 7. 394 have directly or indirectly interfered in the internal operations of the

Companies, nor have they affected, in any manner, the property and administration rights of the
Companies. On the contrary, the Companies “continue to be profitable and to have a surplus, and
are in operation, under GRUMA'’s control.”

Third, Venezuela states that the Claimants have not complied with their burden of evidencing how
Decree No. 7.394, the seizure measures and the Administrative Ordinance have had the impact of
an expropriation*!°. Specifically, it alleges that the Claimants “have failed to carry out acoherent,
concatenated and causal analysis of the measures they complain about to justify the [sic] existence
ofa [sic] ‘creeping expropriation”

Contrary to Claimants’ arguments, Decree No. 7394 and the seizure measures are completely
different and independent from each other. The Decree and the seizure measures have a different
origin and objective, different recipients and do not respond to a coordinated plan or pattern*””, In
effect, it would not make sense to use precautionary measures, since the alleged purpose of
expropriating the Companies could be achieved with the issuance of Decree No. 7.394 and the
implementation of the expropriation process‘.

Respondent states that, between the expropriation process and the precautionary measures there
is a mere chronological relationship rather than the cause-effect relationship attributed to them by

the Claimants. The Claimants have neither evidenced that the measures are concatenated nor that
414

On the other hand, Venezuela argues that if the Administrative Ordinance, Decree No. 7394 or
the seizure measures were to had the expropriation effects now attributed to them by the
Claimants, then they would have filed an expropriation claim with their Request for Arbitration*"*.
In the words of Venezuela, the fact that the Claimants had not included an expropriation claim in
the Request for Arbitration - when the Administrative Ordinance already existed - shows that this
claim has no legal and factual grounds and, furthermore, that the Valuation Date of the alleged
expropriation, from the day prior to the publication of the Administrative Ordinance, is
arbitrary""*,

Fourth, Venezuela arguments that Decree No. 7.394 has not resulted in expropriation of
Claimants’ investments in the Companies. The Respondent asserts that the Decree "has not had
the effect of depriving the holders of the ownership of the assets or preventing the owners from
transferring them" and explains that, pursuant to Article 5 of the Decree, the transfer of the
ownership right on all the assets would only occur with the completion of the expropriation
process set forth in the law. The procedure has not been completed, since it is suspended at the
request of the Claimants*”’. In any event, the process has complied with Article V of the BIT and
Venezuelan law.

According to Venezuela, the BIT does not prohibit expropriation, but rather regulates the manner
of exercising the right to expropriate or nationalize*"*. Respondent alleges that, although there has
been no expropriation, the process initiated by Decree No. 7.394 fully complies with the
requirements of the BIT and Venezuelan law, for the following reasons:

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 80 of 375

366. First, the Decree No. 7.394 is based ona public utility or social interest Purpose, established in
Vv lan law and 1 by the C ion, since its objective is the "availability and
timely access to quality food and in sufficient quantity to the population’.

 

367. Second, Venezuela has complied with the fundamental due process rules under international law
and Venezuelan law, since (i) the Claimants received a notification prior the expropriation in
accordance with Venezuelan law; (ii) they have been entitled to be heard during the multiple
negotiations between the Parties; and (iii) they have had the possibility of submitting the decisions
affecting them to a jurisdictional court to enforce their rights.

368. Furthermore, the expropriation process is suspended in the administrative phase and the amicably
settlement phase remains open without the expropriation having taken place‘. In fact, after
submitting its Request for Arbitration, the Claimants represented that negotiations with the
Venezuelan government were ongoing’?!, Regarding the Liaison Commission, it is
incomprehensible that the Claimants label it as illegal when they, themselves, agreed to its
creation’?

369. Third, the process has not been a discriminatory process, inasmuch Venezuela has issued 24
expropriation decrees with respect to other food companies under the Ley de Seguridad y
Soberania Alimentaria, for the execution of a specific work for each of them*??, Moreover, the
Claimants have not d pli with i ional law req to evid the
alleged discrimination, namely, (i) that the Companies are in similar circumstances to other
companies; (ii) that these companies have received less severe treatment; (iii) that they were
discriminated because of their nationality or another category protected by international law, or
that the Decree No. 7.394 unreasonable’.

370. With respect to Demaseca, Venezuela clarifies that Decree No. 7394 does not affect such company
and that it is not subject to any expropriation process. In effect, the Decree solely mentions
Monaca and its assets, Demaseca is a legal entity completely different from Monaca and it is
inadmissible pretending that it should be considered as a property of the latter for the simple fact
that both share industrial facilities>. According to Respondent, the decision to include Demaseca
within the valuation process was taken by mutual agreement between the Parties, and does not

imply that it is subject to an expropriation process”®,

371.

Fifth, Respondent argues that even if during the expropriation process of Monaca there had been
some illegality or breach of formal requirements required by Venezuelan law, such non-
compliance does not constitute an international illegality*?’.

372. Based on the decisions of the tribunals of Feldman v. Mexico, Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine and
EnCana vy. Ecuador, Venezuela argues that “an expropriation cannot be considered illegal from
the international law point of view, when the investor intentionally ignores the remedies that local
law has in place to solve and correct the violations argued by the investor®. This omission

would result in the disqualification of the corresponding claim and would demonstrate the
negligence, lack of seriousness and credibility of the Claimants’ argument".

In the case at hand, the Claimants had at their disposal all applicable domestic remedies. Through
using such remedies the Claimants would have been able to overcome the alleged violations they
now argue, including the alleged delay in concluding the negotiations and its harmful effects.
However, the Claimants decided not to use such remedies’. Consequently, they cannot now
claim that an expropriation took place under the BIT"',

we
a
a

374. To contradict this Claimants’ argument, Venezuela states that the subjective assessments of an
investor regarding the possibility to use domestic remedies are insufficient to justify their
omission. Moreover, the Claimants have not evidenced the alleged irregularities in the third party
proceeding (incidente de terceriasyand have not demonstrated that there is a connection between
such irregularities and the domestic remedies that they could have used to address their
situation’

 

 

375. Finally, Venezuela argues that, insofar an expropriation has not yet taken place, the obligation to
pay by the Respondent and the corresponding right of the Claimants to receive a compensation
thereof, has not arisen. In other words, Claimants’ claim for compensation is groundless.

376. In this regard, the Respondent reiterates, on one hand, that the expropriation process is suspended
and that, even after the commencement of the arbitration, the Parties have continue discussing in
order to agree on the fair price or to achieve some other type of amicable settlement, different to
expropriation**’. On the other hand, it argues that, in the event of an indirect expropriation claim,
there would be no obligation to compensate without the court having previously resolved that, in
effect, such expropriation took place™.

 

377. Respondent also alleges that, even in the event of an expropriation, the lack of payment of the
compensation does not in itself constitute an international law violation. Citing the tribunals of
ConocoPhillips v, Venezuela and Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela, inter alia, the Respondent
maintains that the negotiation process meets the requirement of legality. In the case at hand,
the Parties began negotiations shortly after the issuance of Decree No. 7.394 and, in this context,
Venezuela has made and d proposals and d garding the
of the Companies".

 

 

378. In summary, Venezuela submits that there has been no expropriation of the Claimants’
investments since: (i) the Claimants have not been deprived of their investment in the Companies;
(ii) the seizure measures ordered by a judge in the framework of the criminal proceeding, vii
vis, Fernandez Barrueco are temporary and may be rendered null and void; and (iii) the Parties
are in an amicably settlement phase and Decree No. 7.394 has not resulted in the expropriation of
the Companies”.

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 82 of 375

379. Claimants allege that Venezuela expropriated their investments in breach of Article V of the BIT.
Expropriation would have occurred progressively through a series of measures that, cumulatively,
have “features and effects equivalent” to an expropriation’**. These measures are (i) the seizure
and special administration measures arising from the criminal proceedings against Mr. Fernandez
Barrueco — including the SAREN and SUDEBAN circulars -; (ii) Decree No. 7.394 and the
imposition of the Liaison Commission; and (iii) the Administrative Ordinance that, according to
the Claimants, is the “climax” of the expropriation?

 

380. Claimants contend that these measures are intrinsically related"° and that, accordingly, they have
lost de iure control of the Companies and the value of their shares is “virtually zero”.""' They also
argue that the expropriation was unlawful because it failed to abide by the terms of the Treaty. In
particular, they allege that they have not received compensation, that the expropriation was
contrary to Venezuelan law and that it was discriminatory.“

381. Venezuela rejects Claimants’ allegations and explains that the scizure and special administration
measures — including the Administrative Ordinance, and Decree No. 7.394 are completely different
and independent procedures, and that none of these measures, individually or cumulatively
considered, has resulted in a total or substantial loss of Claimants’ control over their investments
or destroyed their value. In addition, Respondent holds that the request for compensation is without
cause because there has been no expropriation and that, in any event, the expropnation process has
complied with the requirements under Venezuelan and international law.

382. As a starting point, the Tribunal notes that Claimants have not alleged that Venezuela directly
expropriated their investments in the country.“ Their argument has focused on demonstrating that
the measures imposed by Venezuela are an indirect expropriation that occurred progressively.“ It
further notes that the focus of the Claimants’ expropriation allegation seeks to demonstrate that it
lost control of the Companies and that its investment therein is “worth zero”. Therefore, the
Tribunal shall examine, on the basis of the factual and legal arguments put forward by the Parties
in this arbitration, whether Venezuela subjected Claimants’ investments to an_ indirect
expropriation in breach of Article V of the BIT and whether the foregoing items proposed by
Claimants have been demonstrated,

383. The Tribunal shall begin by establishing the standard of indirect expropriation under the Treaty
and, in particular, that of creeping expropriation.

384. Article V of the BIT provides that “investments [...] shall not be subject to nationalizations,
expropriations, or any other measure of similar features or effects [...]"*. Claimants allege — and
Venezuela does not reject- that the highlighted expression corresponds to the concept of “indirect
expropriation” which, unlike direct expropriation, does not entail a formal transfer of title to the
affected goods or rights.“ It is not disputed then that the BIT covers indirect expropriations.

385. With respect to the applicable standard, Claimants note that “the fundamental characteristic of
indirect expropriation is the adverse effect that the measure has on the use, exploitation and
enjoyment inherent in the investor’s property right”.“” However, Claimants themselves specify
that the adverse effect is not sufficient, but that there must be a “substantial deprivation” of the
investor’s use, exploitation and enjoyment of its investment."“* In this sense, they maintain that
there is expropriation if the investor is totally or significantly deprived of the ownership or effective
control of its investment, or if the investment is totally or significantly deprived of its value.”

386. Respondent states that “a measure amounts to an expropriation if the claimant was substantially
or radically deprived of the ic use and enjc Of its ii or if the ir has
been effectively neutralized, in its entirety or almost in its entirety”.**° Respondent also points out
that the expropriation measures must be definitive or permanent.**!

 

387. Venezuela concedes that the loss of control could amount to an expropriation; however, it specifics
that for this to be the case, the investor should not be allowed to use or dispose of its investment.*?
In order for there to be an expropriation for the loss of value of the investment, Respondent submits
that the claimant must prove that the measure destroyed all, or virtually all, the economic value of
the investment.4?

388. In relation to creeping expropriation, Claimants explain that it “entails a gradual but cumulative
invasion of property rights to the point where the measures at issue lead to the effective denial of
the owner's interest in its property”.“*4 Venezuela adds that a creeping expropriation claim
requires the claimant to present a “coherent, concatenated and causal analysis of the measures of
which they complain” .*** Namely, that it demonstrates that the measures are related and respond
toa pattern of conduct of the State. Claimants do not contest this standard and insist that the Decree
and the seizure and special administration measures are indisputably related.‘°°

389. The Tribunal notes that the Parties seem to agree on several aspects of the standard applicable to
an indirect expropriation.‘*” The underlying principle of their propositions is that a measure or
series of measures attributable to a State constitutes an expropriation if it entails total or substantial
deprivation of the investor’s essential property rights over its investment, in particular its economic
use and enjoyment. The Parties also seem to agree that expropriation would occur if the investor
is wholly or significantly deprived from the ownership or effective control of its investment, or if
the investment is totally or significantly deprived of its value.

390. The Tribunal considers that, in the context of an indirect expropriation, the deprivation of those
fundamental rights musts be of such magnitude that the Tribunal concludes that maintaining the
title to the investment does not represent any benefit to the investor. Only in such scenario, and
considering all the circumstances of the case, could the measure or measures at issue be considered

to have “similar characteristics and effects” to an expropriation within the meaning of Article V of
the BIT.

391. | This approach coincides with that of the several arbitral tribunals that the Parties quoted. For
example, the tribunal of Pope & Talbot v. Canada (Damages Award) determined that the test of
whether interference with business activities constitutes expropriation lies in establishing “whether
such interference is sufficiently restrictive to support the conclusion that property has been ‘taken’
Srom its owner”.*

392. In Tecmed v. Mexico, the tribunal explained that under international law is deemed to be a
deprivation of property “when there is dispossession of its use or of the enjoyment of its benefits,
or interference with such use or enjoyment of equivalent effects or magnitude [...]?.4?

393. The tribunal in Vivendi v. Argentina II, referring to the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in
Starrett Housing v. Iran stated that “it is admitted in international law that measures taken by a
state may interfere with property rights to such extent that these rights are devoid of content and
are to be considered as expropriated [...)".

394. In the light of the facts proven in the arbitration, the Tribunal must examine whether the measures
attributable to Venezuela have interfered with the economic use and enjoyment of Claimants’
investment to such extent that Claimants are to be considered stripped of their property. Such
would be the case if, as a result of such measures, Claimants lost control of their investments or
the value of their shares was destroyed, as they alleged happened.

395. Having established the standard of indirect expropriation, it is useful to clarify the concept of
“creeping expropriation”. Arbitral tribunals that have resolved investor-State disputes agree that
creeping expropriation is a form of indirect expropriation resulting from a series of measures
adopted by the state over a period of time, which, taken together, have the effects of an
expropriation.

 

396. For example, the Tribunal in LG&E v. Argentina described creeping expropriation as an indirect
expropriation that manifests itself gradually and increasingly.**' Also, the tribunal of Generation
Ukraine v. Ukraine noted that:

“Creeping expropriation is a form of indirect expropriation with a temporarily distinctive
quality in the sense that it encapsulates the situation in which a series of acts attributable
to a State over a period of time culminate in the expropriation of such property”.

397. — In the same vein, the Tribunal of Siemens v. Argentina, invoked by Claimants, noted that:

“By definition, a gradual expropriation refers to a process, to the steps that ultimately have
the effect of an expropriation. If the process stops before reaching that _point, then the
expropriation does not happen. This does not necessarily mean that there are no adverse
effects. Obviously, each step must have an adverse effect that may not be important in
itself or be id and act. The last step of a gradual expropriation that tilts
the balance is similar to the drop that fills the glass. The previous drops may not have had

a perceptible effect, but they are part of the process that provokes the overflow".

398. The Tribunal agrees with these definitions of the concept of creeping expropriation which “are
also accepted by the Parties. In short, a gradual or progressive indirect expropriation (creeping
expropriation) results from a series of actions or measures attributable to the State which, taken
together, have the effects of an expropriation, but which alone or separately do not give rise to an
expropriation.

399.  Asnoted above, in the Memorial and the Replication, the Claimants contended that Venezuela had
subjected its investments to a creeping expropriation that would have culminated or would have
been d with the publication of the Admini: Ordi on January 22, 2013.46
Claimants further pointed out that it was the cumulative effect of the measures imposed by
Venezuela, ending with the Administrative Ordinance, which shaped the indirect expropriation.4
Claimants also referred to specific facts or situations that, according to them, denote the loss of
control over their investments and would have meant the destruction of the value of their respective
shares in the Companies.” Finally, in their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants argued for the first time
in the arbitration that Decree No. 7.394, by itself, constitutes an indirect expropriation.“

400. For methodological reasons, the Tribunal shall begin by analyzing this last allegation, namely, the
alleged indirect expropriation arisen from Decree No. 7.394. Subsequently, the Tribunal shall
analyze the allegation. of a creeping expropriation that would have culminated with the
Administrative Ordinance. Finally, the Tribunal shall refer to the Parties’ arguments concerning
the alleged loss of control and destruction of value of their investments.

a. The alleged indirect expropriation arisen from Decree No. 7.394.

401. In their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants, in contrast to what they argued in their earlier briefs and
during the Hearing, [they] argued that Decree No. 7.394 itself constitutes an indirect
expropriation.“* Claimants have also seemed to suggest that the Administrative Ordinance itself
may have expropriatory effects.‘”” However, the Tribunal finds that neither the allegations nor the
evidence submitted by Claimants support these claims.

402. First, because consistently in their allegations of both jurisdiction and merit, Claimants have
emphasized that it is the relationship between all measures — whether related to or arisen from
Decree No. 7.394, as well as the seizure and special administration measures — that results in a
creeping expropriation of their investments in Venezuela. This new allegation in the Post-Hearing
Brief is surprising in light of the approach made by Claimant throughout the arbitration.

403. Second, because even if this late allegation was to be received, the Tribunal does not find that
Claimants have proved that Decree No. 7.394, alone or in conjunction with one or more of the
measures said to be related thereto, and without regard to the measures adopted in the framework
of the criminal proceedings against Mr. Fernandez Barrueco, contains such a limitation on the
essential property rights of the Claimants in their investments as to lead to the conclusion that it
gave rise to an indirect expropriation. In particular, and as explained below, the Tribunal does not

consider that at the Hearing had been proved, as Claimants asserted in their Post-Hearing Brief,
that Decree No. 7.394 prevented them or prevents them from receiving dividends or profits from
Monaca and Demaseca.‘”!

It is clear from the Claimants’ allegations prior to their Post-Hearing Brief that neither Decree No.
7394 nor the measures that might have resulted from that decree, alone, had the sufficient entity
to configure the alleged indirect expropriation.” According to the same Claimants throughout this
arbit tion, it is the actions of SAREN, of SUDEBAN and, particularly the actions of the special

ing in the Admini Ordi that are decisive for the alleged
destruction of value of the investment.‘”? These measures were issued as a consequence of the
process initiated against Mr. Fernandez Barrueco and not of Decree No. 7.394. Accordingly,
beyond the allegation in their Post-Hearing brief, Claimants have not proven that by eliminating
the measures originating in the process against Mr. Fernandez Barrucco — which Claimants have
qualified as determinative -, and relying solely on Decree No. 7.394, an indirect expropriation
occurs.

In summary, both in their briefs and at the Hearing, Claimants contended that the alleged
expropriation is a consequence of the combined effect of the seizure and special administration
measures and Decree No. 7.394‘ and that this creeping expropriation would have been
consummated with the issuance of the Administrative Ordinance in January 2013. The Tribunal

. then proceeds analyze that allegation.

b. The alleged creeping expropriation that culminated in the Administrative Ordinance.

The Tribunal has already concluded that there has been a de. e facto | relationship between Decree No.
7.394 and the seizure and special i ‘ion the A

and that they all form part of the same dispute notified by Claimants in their Notice of Dispute.
The Tribunal shall then proceed to analyze Claimants’ allegation that Venezuela subjected their
investments to a creeping expropriation that culminated in the Administrative Ordinance.

475

Claimants allege that the Administrative Ordinance, published on January 22, 2013, was the
“climax” of the indirect expropriation.*” Claimants claim to have lost de iure control over Monaca
and Demaseca as a result of this ordinance that gives special administrators the “broadest powers
of administration” over the Companies, and orders them to adjust their performance to the agrifood
policies of Venezuela and to submit financial statements of their management at the close of each
fiscal year.4””

The Tribunal considers that neither the text of the Administrative Ordinance, nor its comparison
with the resolutions prior to its issuance that relate to the same subject matter, nor the evidence in
the file regarding the actions of the special administrators after its entry into force support the

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 87 of 375

Claimants’ allegations regarding the scope and effects of that Ordinance.

409. Claimants have emphasized that, unlike the previous resolutions, the Administrative Ordinance
gives administrators “the broadest powers of administration” over the Companies and, in that
sense, grants them the power to control them.‘”8 The Tribunal does not agree with this construction.
In order to determine its scope, the discussed expression must be read in context. Article 2 of the
Administrative Ordinance provides as follows:

“The aforementioned Special Administrators shall have the broadest powers of
administration to guarantee the possession, custody, safekeeping, use and conservation of
the movable and immovable property of the limited companies listed in article | of this
Administrative Ordinance, in such sense, they shall guard the assets, property and rights
that are part of the referred Companies, aimed at their operation”. [emphasis added]

410. The transcribed text indicates that the “broadest powers of administration” are linked to the
specific purpose of protecting the movable and immovable property of the Companies in the
development of the precautionary measures ordered in the criminal proceedings against Mr.
Fernandez Barrueco. In that sense, the Administrative Ordinance does not entail a general power
to direct the Companies nor does it confer on special administrators the broader powers than those
they had by virtue of resolutions issued by the Ministry of Economy and Finance between
December 2009 and December 2012. Indeed, such resolutions gave special administrators the
power to “take all necessary measures for the custody, conservation and management of the

company and its corresponding assets, in order to prevent them from being altered, disappearing,
deteriorating or destroying [...)”"”.

411. It follows from the foregoing that, from a purely textual point of view, the Administrative
Ordinance did not extend the powers of the administrators in such a way as to give them the full
and unlimited of the C ies. Both lutions prior to the Administrative
Ordinance and the latter refer to administrative powers related to and necessary to maintain the
company and the assets that are the subject of the precautionary measures issued in the criminal
proceedings against Mr. Fernandez Barrueco.

412. In addition to the text of the Administrative Ordinance itself, it is necessary to analyze the effects
of the measure to determine whether it had the impact attributed to it by Claimants and, in
particular, whether its issuance resulted in different and broader actions than those performed by
the special administrators prior to its effective date. The Tribunal has examined the evidence in the
file relating to the actions of special administrators prior to and after January 22, 2013 — the
issuance date of the Administrative Ordinance — and finds no evidence that there has been, de iure
or de facto, a material change between the functions exercised by special administrators prior to
the Administrative Ordinance and after its publication.4°

478 See Brief, 4 21.

479 See for example, Resolution 2.549 of December 4, 2009 of the Ministry of People’s Power for Economy and Finance (Ministerio
del Poder Popular para la Economia y Finanzas), published in the Official Gazette No. 39.333 of December 22, 2009, Article 2
(Exhibit C-10); Resolution 2.628 of March 1, 2010 of the Ministry of People’s Power for Economy and Finance, published in the
Official Gazette No. 39.377 of March 2, 2010, Article 2 (Exhibit C-11); Resolution 2.623 of the Ministry of People’s Power for
Economy and Finance of March 1, 2010, published in the Official Gazette No. 39.377 of March 2, 2010, Article 2 (Exhibit C-60);
Resolution No. 3.268 of the Ministry of People’s Power of Planning and Finance (Ministerio del Poder Popular de Planificacién
y Finanzas), of December 10, 2012, published in the Official Gazette No. 40.069 of December 11, 2012, Article 2 (Exhibit C-64).
48 In this context, the Tribunal notes that on April 30, 2013, Gruma informed the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission that it
has lost control over Monaca and Demaseca and, accordingly, would cease to consolidate the operations of the Companics in its
financial statements as of January 22, 2013 (Gruma’s 2012 20-F Report (Exhibit C-44)). However, on April 29, 2013, when the
Administrative Ordinance came into force, a Gruma spokesman told the media that “although officially and legally control was
granted to these special administrators back in Venezuela, in fact Gruma continues to operate the companies as we had been
doing since the expropriation took place”. (A. Martinez, “Mexican Gruma says it continues to operate plants in Venezuela, it

413. Moreover, in the communications subsequent to January 2013, and in response to requests from
the Companies to carry out certain acts, the special administrators pointed out that they could not

 

perform tasks of and ‘ion of the C since, ding to the
Administrative Ordinance, their mandate i is limited to “what is related or linked” to Mr. Fernandez
Barrueco.**!

414, In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that there is no evidence that the Administrative
Ordinance entailed a formal or material change in the powers and functions of the special
administrators in relation to those they exercised prior to the publication and entry into force of
such Administrative Ordinance.

415. In the Tribunal’s view, this conclusion would be sufficient to dismiss the claim of creeping
expropriation as alleged in this arbitration. Indeed, Claimants held that the expropriation occurred
progressively and that the Administrative Ordinance was “the measure that consummated the
indirect expropriation” .“*? Claimants reaffirm this criterion upon setting the Valuation Date on the
day immediately preceding the application of this measure“®* and not on the issuance date of
Decree No. 7.394 — which they attempted to give by itself the effect of a measure of indirect
expropriation in the Post-Hearing Brief -, nor of the administrative resolutions prior to the
Administrative Ordinance. The foregoing would entail that, according to Claimants’ own judgment
in the generality of their arguments,. the actions attributable to Venezuela, prior to the
Administrative Ordinance, were not sufficient to conclude that they had lost the control over their
investments to the extent that they should be considered expropriated.

416. The reports issued by Gruma prior to the publication of the Administrative Ordinance confirm this
conclusion. Indeed, in its 2011 Annual Report, submitted on April 30, 2012,** Gruma confirmed
that Valores and Consorcio maintained control over the Companies, despite the fact that the other
measures discussed in this arbitration — in particular, Decree No. 7.394, the Liaison Commission,
the SAREN and SUDEBAN circulars and the appointment of special administrators — had already
been implemented and were still in force after two years.‘®° As of the date of that Annual Report,
Claimants had already filed the Notice of Dispute.

417. Inthe section on “Financial Information — Legal Proceedings”, the 2011 Annual Report states as
follows:

“On May 12, 2010, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the “Republic”) published
decree number 7.394 in the Official Gazette of Venezuela (the “Expropriation Decree”),

negotiates expropriation”, Reuters, April 29, 2013 (Exhibit R-073) and “Gruma points out that it keeps operating its plants in
Venezuela”, E/ Universal, April 29, 2013 (Exhibit R-076). This statement points out that Claimants themselves had at least serious
doubts as to whether after the publication of the Administrative Ordinance they had lost control of the Companies" operations.
‘8! See, for example, Letter from Special Administrators to H. Castro (Monaca), April 25, 2013 (Exhibit R-073); Letter from
Special Administrators to G. Rios (Valores and Consorcio), April 29, 2013 (Exhibit R-075); Letter from Special Administrators
to H. Castro (Monaca), May 22, 2013, (Exhibit R-086); Letter from Special Administrators to H. Castro (Monaca), May 30, 2013

4* The Tribunal notes that this report is presented “in accordance with the general provisions applicable to securities issuers and

Gruma’s 2010 Annual Report, such company included statements substantially equal to those of the 2011 Annual Report with
respect to the description of the measures on Monaca and Demaseca, and the maintenance of ownership and control over those
Companies. (See GRUMA, 2010 Annual Report, pages 53-55 (Exhibit R-06)).

in which it announced the forced acquisition of all movable and immovable property of
the Company’s subsidiary in Venezuela, Molinos Nacionales, C.A. (“MONACA”). The
Republic has stated to GRUMA’s representatives that the Expropriation Decree extends to
our subsidiary Derivados de Maiz Seleccionado, DEMASECA, C.A. (“DEMASECA”).

[.-]

The Venezuelan government has not taken physical control on MONACA’s or
DEMASECA’ s assets, nor has it taken control of their operations. Consequently, GRUMA
can validly and legally affirm that, to date, Valores Mundiales and Consorcio Andino have
full legal ownership over the rights, interests, shares and assets of MONACA and
DEI E respectively, and that they also have complete control on all if
decisions, operations and directives in [the Companies], which shall not cease until Gruma,
through Valores Mundiales and Consorcio Andino, finally agrees with the Venezuelan
government the terms and conditions of the transfer of such assets, in accordance with the
legal and business schemes currently being negotiated with the Venezuelan
government”.*%

418. In the same section, the report refers to seizure and special administration measures issued by
virtue of the criminal proceedings against Mr. Fernandez Barrueco, to the first instance decision
in the third party proceeding (incidente de tercerias) and to the fact that the appeal against such
decision had not been resolved. However, the report does not mention any negative consequences
arisen from the imposition of such measures.**”

419. Gruma’s contemporaneous statements point out that even two years after the adoption of the
seizure and special administration measures, and the issuance of Decree No. 7.394 and the
imposition of the Liaison C i Claimants idered that they still ined
and control over the Companies. As the Tribunal pointed out earlier, the Administrative Ordinance
did not entail a substantial change in the powers and authorizations of the special administrators
by virtue of the resolutions in effect when Gruma filed the referred reports. In terms of the tribunal
of Siemens v. Argentina (Award), in this case the measure that would have represented the last step
in the expropriation did not have the entity to “provoke the overspill”.**

420. As the Tribunal already noted, this analysis would suffice to reject Claimants’ specific allegation
that Venezuela subjected their investments to a creeping expropriation that would have culminated
in the Administrative Ordinance.*®? However, in order to fully address the Parties’ allegations, the
Tribunal shall examine the other arguments offered by them in relation to the alleged indirect
expropriation.

& The alleged loss of control.

421. In their various briefs, Claimants have pointed out to various events that would demonstrate that
Venezuela has substantially deprived them of control over their investments.’ The Tribunal notes
that Claimants have not referred to the same events in all of their briefs as facts giving rise to the
alleged indirect expropriation. However, they have consistently maintained that the following
events denote a total or substantial loss of control over their investments: (i) Claimants may not

enter into corporate acts requiring registration; (ii) Claimants may not distribute dividends and
transfer capital; (iii) Venezuelan officers intervene in the day-to-day decisions of Companies; (iv)
Claimants cannot dispose of the Companies’ assets, and (v) Claimants have lost de iure control of
their investments as a result of the Administrative Ordinance.

422. Claimants attribute this total or substantial loss of control, on one hand, to the effects of Decree
No. 7.394 and, on the other hand, to the alleged prohibition on notarizing or authenticating acts
involving Monaca, Demaseca or the Claimants — a prohibition arisen from the SAREN circular -,
the immobilization of the Companies’ bank accounts, in accordance with the SUDEBAN circular,

and the need to have the authorization of the special administrators to carry out transfer of funds.*'

423. Below, The Tribunal shall refer to each of the events invoked by Claimants and noted in paragraph
421 above.

424. — First, Claimants argue that as a consequence of the SAREN circular they cannot appoint members
of the board of di of the C or other acts subject to
registration.“ It is not a controversial fact in this arbitration that this measure arises from the
criminal proceedings brought against Mr. Fernandez Barrueco.

 

425. By circular dated December 10, 2009, SAREN requested Public Registrations, Commercial
Registries and Public Notaries to refrain from notarizing or authenticating any legal act or business
in which Monaca, Demaseca, Valores and Consorcio, inter alia, intervened.’ This circular,
however, does not prohibit — as Claimants argue — that they enter into the corporate acts at issue.
Nor is there any evidence that this act had the effect of substantially depriving Claimants of control
over their investments.

426. First, it is not proven in this arbitration that the meeting of boards of directors or other management
bodies of the Companies was prevented or prohibited by virtue of the SAREN circular or any other
measure attributable to Venezuela.

427. Second, it is neither proven that the SAREN circular had prevented or prohibited the holding of
the corporate acts to which Claimants refer, in particular, the approval of financial statements, the
appointment of managers or the declaration of dividends. On the contrary, it has been proven that
the corporate governance bodies of Monaca and Demaseca met after the adoption of the measures
at issue and entered into corporate acts. Indeed, a communication issued by the Claimants points
out that the shareholders’ meeting of the Companies met during 2010, 2011 and 2012, to approve
financial statements and appoint or ratify managers.* Therefore, no impediment has been proven
for the shareholders’ meeting or the corresponding corporate body to meet and make decisions.

428. Third, the Venezuelan law experts of both Parties agree that the failure to register these acts would
affect their enforceability and effects against third parties, but not their validity.’*> In any case, as
it is a measure arisen from a judicial decision in criminal proceedings, Claimants could request
authorization from the judge who issued the measure to formalize or register the corresponding
act.‘°° Claimants did not contest this explanation from Venezuela nor did they submit evidence

that they had even attempted to request authorization to notarize or register any corporate act, nor
have they claimed or proven damages directly arising from the inability to register a specific
corporate act.

429. The SAREN circular may then result, as shall be analyzed upon reviewing the other claims filed
by Claimants, in interference with the operation of the Companies or the management thereof by
Claimants, but not in a loss of control by inability to assemble the corporate bodies or by inability
of the corporate bodies to make decisions or eventually make them effective.

430. Claimants have also alleged that, as a result of the SAREN circular, they are unable to sell their
shares in the Companies.’” For the same reasons set out in the preceding paragraphs, the Tribunal
cannot accept this conclusion. Indeed, the SAREN circular does not restrict or prevent the sale of
Claimants’ shares in Monaca and Demaseca. This is, as demonstrated in the arbitration, an seizure
measure issued in the framework of criminal proceedings against Mr. Fernandez Barrueco,
whereby SAREN prevents entitics that have notarization or registration functions to refrain from
notarizing acts of companies with respect to which the seizure arisen from the aforementioned
criminal proceedings operate. In addition, according to Dr. Velazquez’s expert report — not
disputed by Claimants on this item, both the ownership and the assignment of the shares are proven
by registration in the company’s shares ledger*”® and not in the records referred to in the SAREN
circular. It has not been demonstrated that the sale of shares is one of those acts that, according to
Venezuelan law, must be notarized or registered for purposes of validity or enforceability before
third parties. Therefore, the SAREN measure in no way affects the ability of Claimants to dispose
of their shares in the Companies.

431. The fact that the measures taken in the criminal proceedings to secure the custody and preservation
of property entails the compliance of additional formalities, authorizations or requirements does
not entail, as Claimants seem to suggest, that control has been lost of Claimants’ shares of Monaca
and Demaseca or that the possibility of selling them has been lost.

432. Based on the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal concludes that it has not been proven that the
measure with respect to the registration of acts involving Claimants or Companies entails that they
or those are unable to enter into the corresponding acts or that Claimants have lost total or
substantial control of the Companies.

433. Second, Claimants assert that, as a result of the measures imposed by Venezuela, they lost control
because they cannot receive dividends or profits. Claimants attribute this impediment, first, to the
restriction to register minutes of meeting arisen from the SAREN circular and, second, to the
immobilization of the Companies’ bank accounts ordered by SUDEBAN and to the fact that any
transfer would require the authorization of the special administrators.

434. Likewise, they allege that the distribution of dividends would be hindered by SIEX’s refusal —
allegedly ordered by the Liaison Commission — to update the Companies’ foreign investment
register. Finally, in their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants explained that Decree No. 7.394 prevents
them from receiving dividends or profits from the Companies.” Based on the foregoing,
Claimants contended, for the first time in this arbitration, that the Decree, by itself, would be
sufficient to constitute an indirect expropriation of their investments. The Tribunal shall refer to
each of these arguments.

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 92 of 375

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that, in general terms, the procedure for declaring
dividends is, as follows: the competent corporate governance body meets and approves the balance
sheet. If there are liquid and collected profits,*°' this body may decide whether to distribute them
as dividends to shareholders or to use them for other purposes. If it chooses to declare dividends,
it automatically generates a liability to be borne by the company and an asset — credit right — for
shareholders.

From the foregoing arises an elementary remark made by Respondent and with which the Tribunal
agrees: in order to be able to pay dividends, it is necessary to have declared them. Claimants
admit that they have not declared dividends since 2009 and explain that they have not declared
dividends because it would be futile to do so.*°? Beyond Claimants’ assertion on the alleged
“futility” of having declared dividends, there is no evidence in the arbitration that if there are profits
in the Companies, Claimants have stopped declaring dividends as a consequence of measures taken
by Venezuela or that, having considered the dividend decree by the corporate body, it has been
unable to do so because of the measures adopted by Respondent and, specifically, because of the
SAREN circular or the failure of SIEX to update the registries. Claimants have not alleged, much
less proved, that Venezuelan officers improperly interfered with the decisions of the corresponding
corporate body regarding the use of the profits generated by the Companies.

Claimants have not contributed acts of the administrative bodies or of the meeting that even suggest
the possibility of declaring dividends or reflect the futility of declaring them as alleged by
Claimants.

In addition, the Tribunal reaffi rms that the SAREN circular does not prevent the shareholders of
the Companies from declaring dividends, but rather I the of corp acts.
Claimants do not dispute that under Venezuelan law the act of declaring dividends constitutes
rights and, therefore, it is not necessary to record the corresponding minute for the right to be
enforceable.™ Besides, if the SAREN circular imposes an additional requirement or authorization
under the seizure, Claimants did not prove that they had even attempted to request concept or
authorization to record the respective minute.

On the other hand, Claimants assert that paying dividends would entail altering the Companies’
equity, which would be prohibited by the seizure and special administration measures and Decree
No. 7.394.5°% However, they have not explained how this situation would be outlawed by the
aforementioned measures. To state that “it would be naive to believe that [managers] would
authorize claimants to pay millions of dividends” is not sufficient to satisfy their burden of proof.

Regarding the conduct of SIEX — not to process the update of the foreign investment register,
required to transfer foreign currency abroad -, the Tribunal remarks that the Parties do not agree
on what is the basis for their action, if an order of the Liaison Commission or measures arising
from the criminal proceedings against Mr. Fernandez Barrueco. Indeed, Claimants contend that
SIEX has not processed the requests to update Monaca’s foreign investment registry by order of

required Monaca to present “the authorization duly issued by the corresponding intervening
board” to request the registration of a sub-license contract for the use of a trademark entered into
by and between Monaca and a Swiss company.*” On the other hand, Venezuela points out that the
SIEX measure arises from the seizure issued within the criminal proceedings against Mr.
Fernandez Barrueco.5"”

441 Regardless of the basis for its action, The Tribunal considers that the conduct of SIEX does not
constitute a prohibition on declaring or paying dividends, but an obstacle to transferring
investment-related payments abroad. In this sense, Venezuela’s conduct could represent a breach
of the obligation set forth in Article VII of the BIT or other standards of protection stated in the
Treaty.*'' but the provided evidence does not prove that such action entails a loss of control, use
or enjoyment of the investment equivalent to expropriation.

442. Finally, the Tribunal does not consider that at the Hearing had been proven, as Claimants stated in
their Post-Hearing Brief,5” that Decree No. 7.394 prevented them or prevents them from receiving
dividends or profits from Monaca and Demaseca.°!*

443. Claimants base their conclusion exclusively on a particular construction of Mr. Nelson Alba’s
assertion during the Hearing. Indeed, Respondent’s witness confirmed that disposing of the assets
covered by the Decree would be a breach thereof.'* However, he never asserted, as Claimants
suggest, that the Decree covers current assets.of the Companies.*!*

444. The issue of whether or not the profits of Companies are affected by Decree No. 7.394 has been
widely debated by the Parties in this arbitration. Respondent has indicated that the goods affected
by the Decree are exclusively those used for the operation of Monaca or for the large-scale
production, agro-industrial processing and storage of certain products, including machinery,
equipment and work implements. In that regard, Respondent submits that the money of the
Companies, including the dividends declared, would not be affected by the Decree, as it does not
comply with the purpose stated therein.*"° This issue was confirmed by the Venezuelan expert
during his cross-examination at the Hearing:

“Q: You couldn’t get the current assets out of Venezuela. Right? A: Current assets are their
property. Q: Current assets are money. Right? A: Of course, they are their property. I'm not
interested in money, I'm interested in goods to produce food. [...]”°"”.

445. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not find it possible to conclude, from Claimants’ particular
construction of Mr. Nelson Alba’s words at the Hearing, that Decree No. 7.394 prevents Claimants
from receiving profits or distributing dividends. There is also no evidence that Claimants, as
shareholders of the Companies, have even discussed at meetings or other management meetings
of the Companies about the profit decree or sharing and the simple assertion in this arbitration that
it would have been futile is no more than a mere appreciation of Claimants.

446. Third, Claimants contend that, through the de facto merger between the Liaison Commission and
the special administration, Venezuela has interfered in the administration of Monaca and
Demaseca. This interference would be reflected, for example, in the need to seek authorization
from government officers for any disbursement or transfer of their bank accounts and in the
hampering of certain business decisions. In addition, Venezuelan officials would have occupied
the offices and facilities of the Companies and requested information of a different nature.*®

447. The Tribunal considers that the intervention of Venezuelan officials in Monaca and Demaseca
affected and affects the ordinary functioning and operation of the Companies and imposes on the
administration appointed by Claimants difficulties in the administration of the Companies. This
intervention, its context, its scope and the alleged juxtaposition of functions between the Liaison
Commission and the special administration, not only creates confusion, but also has effects for the
analysis of the Claimants’ claim for breach of fair and equitable treatment as discussed in Section
V.B.3 of this Award.

448. However, for purposes of the alleged indirect expropriation, the Tribunal does not find evidence
that such confusion between the functions of the Liaison Committee and the special administrators
was sufficient to displace, substitute or remove the shareholders or managers or employees of the
Companies designated by the shareholders. There is also no evidence that the members of the
Liaison Commission or the special administrators exercised functions of administration or
management of the Companies to such extent that the Claimants lost control over their investment
ina total or substantial manner.

449. As examples of the intervention of the special administrators and the Liaison Committee in the
day-to-day decisions of the companies, Claimants indicate that these officers warned that they
would not recognize expenses associated with a corporate event;>!” refused to authorize payments
corresponding to the lease fee of a new distribution center;>° vetoed the termination of a lease
agreement of a pasta plant’?! and rejected an application to transfer vehicles owned by that
company.°”?

 

450. | However, Claimants knowledged that the p for the event and the
lease fee for the new distribution center, as well as the termination of the agreement and closure of
the pasta plant were eventually authorized.*? In other words, they were acts whose execution was
initially rejected by Respondent’s officers, but were subsequently authorized by those same
officers. However, besides, they are acts whose entity and significance is not sufficient to hold that
they result in a loss of the investment control of the Claimants, to such extent that none of these
acts, as a whole or individually, were subject of a statement of loss control. Nor is there any
evidence in the file that as a result of such acts the Claimants or the Companies have been seriously
affected in their operation, or in their ability to manage and control, or that the Companies have
suffered financial loss. In short, these were prior authorization or control measures that generated
difficulty and discomfort in the execution of certain acts, and even confusion as to their origin or
legal basis, but which were not sufficiently significant to indicate a loss of control over the
investment.

451. Fourth, Claimants allege that both the seizure and special administration measures and Decree No.

7.394, prevent them from freely disposing of the Companies’ movable property. In their
Replication, Claimants attributed this restriction mainly to the Decree.°>

452. The evidence submitted to this arbitration indicates that Decree No. 7.394 imposes certain
limitations as to the disposition of the goods covered by Article 1 thereof.°° According to the
Venezuelan expert, such limitations are reduced to preventing the owner from destroying or
altering the property affected by the Decree to the extent where “it becomes impossible for the use
Sor which it is intended to be expropriated”.*"” On the other hand, Claimants have delivered some
communications signed by the special administrators in which they state that the assets covered by
the Decree may not be disposed of until the negotiations between the State and the investors are

luded.58 The to pts issued by special administrators
specifically in connection with the transfer of certain vehicles and the termination of lease
agreements on immovable property referred to by the Tribunal in paragraphs 449 and 450 above.

453. Based on the evidence presented in this arbitration and, in particular, taking into account the
specific les of the alleged i ibility of disp of the C ies’ assets — which refer
to mere consultations with special administrators on the possibility of transferring vehicles — the
Tribunal cannot conclude that there is a restriction on disposing of the Companies’ assets of such
an entity to the conclusion that the Claimants lost substantial control over their investments. A
different matter is the construction made by the Respondent’s officers, who considered that while
the negotiations were suspended and the criminal process. was in force authorizations —
administrative or judicial - were required to dispose of the movable or immovable property,

ion in the i ion of the C

454. Finally, Claimants contend that with the publication of the Administrative Ordinance they lost de
iure control over the Companies. On this item, the Tribunal refers to the provisions of Section
V.A.3.b of this Award.

455. In short, as it was not proven that the SAREN circular had prevented or prevents the corporate
governance bodies of the Companies from meeting and holding corporate acts, including declaring
dividends or deciding on the sale of shares. It is also not proven that the SUDEBAN circular or the
fact that the special administrators must approve banking movements of the Companies has
affected the power of statutory administrators to enter into these acts. Finally, it is not proven that
the conduct of the SIEX prevents the exercise of the power of corporate bodies to declare dividends
and distribute profits.

 

456. As for Decree No. 7.394, the Tribunal did not find that it prevented the distribution of profits. Nor

did it conclude that the limitations arising from this Decree — the impossibility of destroying or
altering the property to the extent that it cannot meet the purpose for which it was appropriated —
and which fall exclusively on the property described in Article 1 of the Decree, are of such entity
to conclude that they amount to a total or substantial loss of the control by the Complainants over
their investments. Nor does the Tribunal find any evidence that as a result of Decree No. 7.394
Claimants are prevented from selling their shares in the Companies. A different matter, as shall be
discussed later, would be the loss of value of the shares of the companies as a consequence of the
measures adopted by Venezuela and which are the subject of the dispute.

457. Finally, the Tribunal concluded that the interference of Venezuelan civil servants in the Companies
— either through the Liaison Commission, the special administrators or a merger between two
concepts — did not have the effect of displacii or
or employees of the Companies, and that their actions did not have the sufficient entity to affirm
that they are indicative of a loss of control over the investment. The Administrative Ordinance did
not mean a material change, de facto or de iure, in the powers that could be exercised by the special
administrators and therefore, does not modify the Tribunal’s conclusions regarding the scope of
their performance in the Companies.

458. In conclusion, none of the actions alleged by Claimants had the scope and effect that Claimants
attribute to them with respect to the control of the investment. Nor was there a measure of an entity
such as to lead the Tribunal to conclude that, by taking this measure together with the others, there
is a total or substantial loss by Claimants over their investments, so that they are to be considered
expropriated.

d. The alleged destruction of the value of the investments.

459. Claimants contend that, in addition to having substantially deprived them of control over the
Companies, the Venezuelan measures have had the effect of destroying the value of their
investments.**° Indeed, they allege that their shares in the Companies have no economic value as
a result of the measures imposed by Venezuela.**! This thesis is based on the assertion of their
experts, according to which:

“As a consequence of the expropriation and management hindrance measures, the
shareholders of Monaca and Demaseca (namely, Valores and Consorcio) are deprived of
any economic benefits that the companies generate or could generate in the future.

Therefore, companies have zero value for their shareholders (or, instead, a hypothetical
buyer).”5?

460. _ First, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants’ experts on valuation of damages (“Dellepiane/Spiller”)
have concluded that the shares “have zero value” because the measures at issue prevent their
shareholders from receiving or disposing of their shares at a positive value.5°>

461. This statement is based, inter alia, on the following assumptions: (i) since the issuance of Decree
No. 7.394 in May 2010, Claimants — or a potential purchaser instead — face the “threat” that their
assets are transferred to Venezuela;™ (ii) Respondent maintains an intervention regime and

2010 and whose completion is uncertain”.

management hindering of the Companies through the Liaison Commission and the special
administrators who, together, form a parallel administration;*> (iii) the Administrative Ordinance
grants “the broadest powers of administration” to the special administrators and binds the
Companies to pursue the State’s public policy purposes in food matters;** and (iv) Claimants may
not distribute dividends as a consequence of the SAREN circular and SIEX’s refusal to update the
Securities registry or Monaca as foreign investment.°”

462. The Tribunal has already concluded that there was no loss of control resulting from the same
behaviors. In any event, the Tribunal shall examine whether the measures had the effect of
destroying the share value of the Companies, under the assumption from which Dellepiane/Spiller
depart, namely that Claimants were right from the point of view of facts and law. Before entering
into the announced analysis, the Tribunal shall briefly refer to the premises which, according to
Claimants, would lead to the conclusion that their share in Monaca and Demaseca are worthless.

463.  Dellepiane/Spiller seem to assume that Decree No. 7.394 has irreversible effects. The Tribunal
does not consider that this hypothesis has been proven in the arbitration. It is not disputed that the
expropriation process initiated by virtue of the aforementioned decree has been suspended since
August 2010, and that there is uncertainty about the duration of the expropriation process. In that
sense the process that could ultimately lead to the assets affected by the Decree being definitively
transferred to Venezuela — or to the Decree being revoked through courts at the request of the
Claimants, according to the possibility posed by Venezuela — has not yet been completed. A
different matter is that the Decree remains in force, that the duration of its validity is uncertain and
that with it remain the limitations to the right to dispose of the affected assets that were discussed
in paragraphs 452 and 453 of this Award.

464. The Tribunal has already noted in paragraphs 446 to 450 of this Award the reasons why it considers
that it has not been proven that Decree No. 7.394 alone, or the measures arisen from the criminal
process, alone, or the aforementioned Decree and measures as a whole, resulted in such
interference by the Venezuelan offi cers in the management of the Companies to conclude that the
di of the C d by holders were relegated to their ions or that the

Claimants lost substantial control over the day-to-day management of the Companies.

 

465. It is worth remembering in this item that the Liaison Commission, to which Claimants attribute a
substantial part of the alleged loss of control, was withdrawn in September 2013, and that the
Administrative Ordinance, issued in connection with the criminal proceeding and which Claimants
consider to be the culminating event of the alleged expropriation, did not result in a material
change, de facto or de iure, in the functions of the special administrators as compared to whose
they had when the Claimants still maintained that they continued to exercise control over the
Companies.

466. In addition, although Claimants and their experts allege that the Administrative Ordinance, upon
stating that special administrators must adjust their actions to the public policies issued by the
Ministry of Food in agrifood matters, “/imits [the][Companies'] ability to generate profits and
make investment decisions that maximize their net present value”,* they have not proven that the
limitation on the ability to produce profits is such that it entails a total destruction of the value of
the Companies.

467. On the other hand, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the State has the power to require

companies, regardless of whether their shareholders are private, to comply with public policies
essential for the compliance of the State’s purposes, as would be the case with food policies.*° On
the other hand, the limitation on the ability to make “investment decisions that maximize [the] net
present value” of the Companies would potentially result i in the value of the Companies not
or di g, but not being pletely d d, as alleged by Claimants.
With respect to the distribution of profits, the Tribunal reaffirms that it was also not proved that
Claimants could not declare and distribute dividends as a consequence of Decree No. 7.394, the
special administration regime, the SAREN circular or the conduct of the SIEX, as explained in
paragraphs 435 to 445 of this Award.

The Tribunal has no doubt that the measures imposed by Venezuela affected the value of
Claimants’ shares in the Companies.“° However, in support of their claim for expropriation,
Claimants have alleged that, because of these measures, their shares in the Companies have no
economic value; in other words, that their value is zero.**'

Based on the evidence submitted in the arbitration, the Tribunal cannot conclude that, as Claimants
assert, the value of the Companies has been destroyed or equals zero. On the contrary, the evidence
on record, and specifically acts performed by or involving the Claimants, indicates that, despite
the measures, the shares of Monaca and Demaseca did not lose their full value and maintain a
market value. Particularly relevant to this conclusion are (i) Gruma’s acquisition of ADM’s shares
in Valores and Consorcio in 2012; (ii) Gruma’s annual reports; and (iii) the relevant information
submitted to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission where companies should truthfully
inform the public and stock market regulatory authorities of events that may affect the value of a
specific company’s shares.°?

With respect to the sale of ADM’s shares, it is proven that, in December 2012, Gruma acquired all
of ADM’s shares in Valores and Consorcio for a total amount of USD$8 million* (the “ADM
Transaction”). From this transaction, the Venezuelan experts inferred that the total value of
Monaca and Demaseca at the date of the transaction was USD$266.7 million.** According to these
experts, the implied value of the Companies on the basis of the ADM Transaction is the best
indication of the value of Monaca and Demaseca in the current scenario as of the Valuation Date
selected by Claimants (January 21,2013).54

Dellepiane/Spiller remark that the ADM Transaction was not about the Companies, but about 3%
of Valores and Consorcio. In addition, they contend that the ADM Transaction only represents
Claimants’ ability to seek compensation from Venezuela for the measures or for the
expropriation.

The Tribunal considers that the ADM Transaction is indicative that the share value of Monaca and
Demaseca is not zero. By the date of the ADM Transaction, all of the measures discussed in this
arbitration — save and except for the Administrative Ordinance, which, as stated, did not have the

impact ascribed to it by Claimants — had already been adopted. Therefore, the ADM Transaction
indicates that Claimants’ shares in Monaca and Demaseca retained value despite of the seizure and
special administration measures and Decree No. 7.394.

474. On the other hand, Gruma’s own valuation reports did not reveal a destruction of the value of its
investment, through Claimants, in Monaca and Demaseca as a result of the measures. Indeed, in
its 2010, 2011 and 2012, annual reports, Gruma referred to the Decree, the negotiations with the
Venezuelan government and the Notification of Dispute and indicated that there were no
indications of impairment of the value of its net investment in the Companies.°47

475. In the 2012 Gruma Annual Report presented in 2013 (‘2012 Gruma Annual Report”), Gruma
stated that it had lost control of Monaca and Demaseca on January 22, 2013, and that, as a result
of that loss of control, it would cease to consolidate the financial information of the Companies in
its financial statements.** This statement is also found in the in Gruma’s 20-F report filed with the
USS. Securities & Exchange Commission on April 30, 2013, for the fiscal year ended on December
31, 2012 (the “Gruma’s 2012 20-F Report”), which ions the exi of the Admini:
Ordinance.

476. Also in the 2012 Annual Report, Gruma indicated that, based on preliminary fair value
calculations, there was no indication of impairment of the value of Gruma’s net investment in the
Companies.** Indeed, the report states the following: :

“Pending resolution of this matter, based on preliminary fair value calculations, no indication of
impairment of the value of GRUMA’s net investment in MONACA and DEMASECA has been
identified. The Company cannot estimate the value of any future impairment charges, if any. The
Company’s net investment in the historical value of MONACA and DEMASECA as of December
31, 2012, is $2,901,726 and $188,563, respectively. The Company does not maintain any insurance
covering the risk of expropriation of its investments”.>>!

477. _ This report does not allow us to conclude that on that date there was a total loss of control — which
Gruma only declared as a consequence of the Administrative Ordinance — or an impairment of the
investments that brought them to “zero “ value. However, according to the aforementioned report,
it is concluded that, based on calculations that qualify as “preliminary”, there were not yet
“identified” that there were “indications” of impairment in the value of Claimants’ net investment
in Monaca and Demaseca, which would not allow us to estimate the possible future charge for

such impairment. Gruma considered then that there was a possibility of a deterioration in the
investment but that it had not been identified and that it was not possible to estimate it at that time.

478. In the Tribunal’s opinion, Gruma’s statements prior to the one declaring the loss of control by the
Administrative Ordinance, together with the ADM Transaction, prove that Claimants’ investment
in the Companies did not have a “zero” value resulting from the seizure and special administration
measures or from Decree No. 7.394. This alleged “zero value” results in large part from a legal
analysis of the Claimants in this arbitration that their experts accept as true, and not from the
contemporary evidence — Gruma’s statements and ADM Transaction — mentioned above. As for
the Administrative Ordinance, it did not have the determining entity and scope attributed to it by
Claimants, and in the balance of evidence the Tribunal considers that the set of statements on the
situation of the Companies added to the ADM Transaction allow it to conclude that the value of
the Companies is not “zero” as claimed by Claimants.

479. Insummary, the Tribunal finds that there is no evidence that, as a result of the seizure and special
administration measures — including the SAREN and SUDEBAN circulars — and Decree No. 7.394,
the Claimants have lost total or substantial control over the Companies. Nor is it proven that the
value their investments has been “wiped out or destroyed”. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that
there has been no indirect expropriation of Claimants’ investments in Venezuela.

480. In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to rule on the alleged
unlawfulness of the expropriation. The Tribunal shall refer to the alleged irregularities in the
expropriation process upon analyzing the claim for unfair and unequitable treatment.

B. THE CLAIM FOR UNFAIR AND UNEQUITABLE TREATMENT
1. Claimants’ Position

481. Claimants allege that Venezuela has breached its obligation to treat Claimants’ investments fairly
and equitably.

482. Article IV of the BIT establishes Venezuela’s obligation to provide Valores and Consorcio with
fair and equitable treatment in accordance with (i) international law, (ii) other investment treaties
ratified by Venezuela, applicable by virtue of the most-favored-nation clause, and (iii) the national
treatment as a floor for the application of the standard.>*”

483. According to Claimants, the standard of fair and equitable treatment requires Venezuela not to
impose measures preventing the investor from enjoying the fruits of its investment, not to act in an
arbitrary, unfair, idiosyncratic or discriminatory manner, abide by due process, act in good faith,
act in a consistent and transparent manner, respect the legitimate expectations of the investor and
refrain from coercing or harassing the investor.**> Valores and Consorcio contend that nothing
prevents a claimant from asserting its claim for fair and equitable treatment on the same facts on
which their claim of expropriation is based, provided that the standard of fair and equitable
treatment is met.>4

484. Claimants allege that Article IV of the BIT, according to which Venezuela must grant “fair and
equitable treatment under international law”, cannot be equated with the minimum standard of
treatment.°> In this context, they argue that Venezuela misconstrues the standard of fair and

equitable treatment, ignoring the language of the Treaty. The BIT does not refer to the minimum
level of treatment, and the construction of the Treaty according to the common sense of its terms,
supports the construction that this is an autonomous standard.°*°

In addition, Venezuela ignores the decisions quoted by Claimants in Vivendi v. Argentina II, Suez
vs. Argentina and Total v. Argentina. In Vivendi v. Argentina II, the court rejected the respondent’s
construction that the standard of “fair and equitable treatment, in accordance with the principles
of international law” was equivalent to the minimum standard of treatment under general
international law, formulated in the case Neer.**’ This tribunal held that the reference to “principles
of international law” in the treaty requires “consideration of a margin of principles of
international law broader than just the minimum standard", adding that “fair and equitable
treatment must be in accordance with the principles of international law, but this requirement of
conformity may serve as both a mini and i limit of the dard of fair and equi
treatment of the treaty”.**= Venezuela quotes the “doctrine” of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (“NAFTA”) ignoring that Article 1105 of this treaty is entitled “minimum standard of
treatment” and that its note of interpretation establishes that the article reflects the minimum
standard of treatment.5°?

In the event that the Tribunal determines that the standard of fair and equitable treatment equals to
the minimum standard of treatment, it has evolved in such a way that it must now be considered
comparable to the independent standard of fair and equitable treatment. The tribunals of Mondev
v. United States and Pope & Talbot v. Canada (Damages Award), inter alia, have acknowledged
that this.°*' Claimants argue that Glamis Gold v. United States is inapplicable because it is a
NAFTA case and in this case the State parties to the BIT have not issued a similar construction.°®

Likewise, according to paragraph 2 of Article IV of the BIT, Venezuela must provide the same
treatment as that guaranteed to investors from a third State, if such treatment is more favorable.
Claimants contend that the simple reading of Article IV of the BIT shows that the most-favored-
nation clause in paragraph 2 qualifies the standard of fair and equitable treatment in paragraph |
and, therefore, the function of the most-favored-nation clause is to “limit” the scope to the standard
of fair and equitable treatment.** Claimants also consider ungrounded Venezuela’s argument that
the most-favored-nation clause cannot be sued to incorporate the fair and equitable treatment of
another treaty because Article IV, paragraph | (which includes the protection of fair and equitable
treatment) was specifically negotiated. Claimants rely on the legislative history of the BIT
Approval Bill. They argue that the purpose of the most-favored-nation clause is precisely to
override the provisions of the base treaty, regardless of whether those provisions were negotiated
with any level of specificity. Finally, Claimants argue that importing a fair and equitable
treatment provision from another investment treaty does not require a comparison with an investor
in similar circumstances.°°

Under the most-favored-nation clause of the BIT, Claimants invoke the application of the text of
the fair and equitable treatment clauses without reference to general international law, included in

bilateral investment treaties in force at the time Venezuela adopted the measures against
Claimants.*’ They mention the Agreement between the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the
Government of the Republic of Belarus on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of
Investments, executed on December 8, 2007 (“Venezuela-Belarus BIT”), the Agreement between
the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Government of the Socialist
Republic of Vietnam for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, executed on November 20,
2008 (“Venezuela-Vietnam BIT”), and the Agreement between the Government of the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela and the Government of the Russian Federation on the Reciprocal Promotion
and Protection of Investments, executed on November 7, 2008 (“Venezuela-Russia_BIT”),**
which entered into force afier the BIT became effective.*” For example, paragraph 2 of Article 2
of the Venezuela-Belarus BIT states that investors’ investments “shall at all times be accorded
fair and equitable treatment and enjoy protection and security”.*” Therefore, in any case,
Venezuela is bound to guarantee fair and equitable treatment independent of any reference to
general international law, without any limitation.57!

 

489. — Claimants contend that Venezuela provided unfair and unequitable treatment by implementing and
maintaining a series of measures on Monaca and Demaseca that deprived the Claimants from the
use and enjoyment thereof for more than for years without any compensation.*” It relies on
Achmea vy. Slovakia to argue that the seizure and special management measures and Decree No.
7.394 have prevented Claimants from receiving the basic benefits of their investments, including
the power to distribute dividends and dispose of F their shareholding in the Companies.*” As a result
of the measures, Claimants have been unable to approve balance sheets and financial statements,
approve management or approve new board members, accept directors’ resignations, sell their
shares in the Companies or dispose of their assets.°""

490. Claimants also allege that Venezuela has acted in a manner that is discriminatory, arbitrary,
contrary to due process and the principle of good faith, in breach of the protection of fair and
equitable treatment.5”

491. Claimants contend that the State action is arbitrary if it has no factual or legal basis, if it acts on a
whim, it is not based on legal provisions, but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference, taking
action for reasons other than those presented or deliberately ignoring due process.5”°

492. According to Claimants, the imposition of the seizure and special administration measures are
arbitrary because they have no factual or legal basis.*’’ They were based on Mr. Fernandez
Barrueco’s alleged shareholding in Monaca and Demaseca, and have been maintained, despite the
fact that Claimants proved before the judge that he had no equity interests in the Companies since
2008, but he ignored the evidence in the record.°’”* Venezuela admits that between May and June
2008, Rotch had already transferred its shares in Monaca and Demaseca to a trust.*” However, in

as a whole, and not only with respect to the fictitious interest of Mr. Fernandez Barrueco.® It
applied the regime of Article 22 of the Law against Organized Crime (Ley contra Delincuencia
Organizada), which is applicable only to seized property and presupposes a final criminal
conviction, which does not exist in this case.**! In addition, the seizure and special administration
measures are of a permanent nature as they were established indefinitely and have been in force
irregularly since December 2009.5"? Vi la has p d the admission of the appeal against
the decision upholding the measures.°?

 

493. Claimants also contend that Decree No. 7.394 was issued arbitrarily, with the aim of taking Monaca
and Demaseca “one way or another” and is of a permanent nature.* One of the reasons for
arbitrariness is that it is based on seizure and special administration measures, in the context
already described. It adds that “despite the fact that the Republic denies the connection between
Decree No. 7.394 and the seizure and special administration measures, the expert absent from the
Republic recognizes this in his report” ** It is also arbitrary, because it was imposed to execute
the “Socialist Agroindustrial Processing Capacity Consolidation for the Venezuela of the XXI
century” program, although this program does not really exist.**° Finally, Decree No. 7.394 is
arbitrary because it is contrary to due process.**”

494. Claimants allege that Venezuela engaged in discriminatory conducts in breach of the standard of
fair and equitable treatment. Although Venezuela claims that it adopted these measures to respond
to the food crisis and that they were imposed on the entire sector, the measures imposed on
Alimentos Polar C.A. and Cargill Venezuela S.A. - companies competing with Monaca and
Demaseca — have not had the scope of those imposed on the Companies.** Alimentos Polar C.A.
and Cargill Venezuela S.A. were expropriated only one warehouse and one rice plant, respectively,
and have not been forced to transfer all their assets for the performance of a public work, while
Decree No. 7.394 subjected the Companies to an expropriation process that affects all of their
assets.”

495. According to Claimants, Venezuela also engaged in conduct contrary to due process, breaching
the standard of fair and equitable treatment. Claimants mention the similarities of this dispute with
Petrobart v. Kyrgyzstan. They allege that Venezuela intervened irregularly in the third party
proceeding (incidente de tercerias) initiated by the Companies and Claimants and in the appeal
filed by the same parties against the deci: in the third party proceeding (incidente de tercerias)
confirming the seizure and special administration measures.*° In addition, they allege that
Venezuela has indefinitely suspended the expropriation proceedings with the aim of not paying the
compensation due, but maintaining the effects of Decree No. 7.394.°”!

 

 

496. Venezuela would also have incurred a denial of justice since Claimants filed an appeal against the
decision rendered in the third party proceeding (incidente de tercerias) more than five years ago,
but the appeal has not yet been admitted.> According to Dr. Canova, the admission of an appeal

is a mere administrative step in which only verification that the appeal was filed on time is
required.” In this context, and taking into account the case of Oostergetel v. Slovakia, a claim for
denial of justice based on unjustified procedural delay does not require to use up internal remedies.

497. In addition, under Venezuelan law, a final court judgment is required and the timely payment of
fair indemnity to occupy the Companies, or in the case of prior occupation, the initiation of an
expropriation suit, including the deposit of the amount of compensation.

498. Venezuela would also have acted contrary to good faith. Respondent has obstructed and delayed
the resolution of the dispute by changing Venezuela’s representatives in the negotiations, imposing
additional requirements in order to create false expectations of good faith negotiation, the
unjustified failure to comply with the conditions agreed upon in the “Commitment Deed” and
failure to respond to Claimants’ continuing invitations to resume the dialogue. It has not acted
in a consistent and transparent manner in its discussions with Claimants, nor has it had adequate
communication with Claimants during the process.*%*

499. Based on E/ Paso v. Argentina, Claimants argue that the standard of fair and equitable treatment
also encompasses reasonableness and proportionality. The seizure and special administration
measures have not been proportional because they affect the whole property of the companies,
despite the fact that, if anything, as Venezuela admits, Mr. Fernandez Barrueco never had more
than a minority and indirect percentage in the Companies.*”. :

500. In addition, Claimants contend that ' V treated its ii unfairly and i itably by
harassing the staff of the Comp by V lan officials, especially the bers of the
Liaison Commission. This harassment was carried out through threats through threats of dismissal
and the taking of operations by force; pressure for the dismissal of employees who did not
sympathize with the government; the submission of Companies’ managers to a regime that exposes
them to criminal and civil sanctions if they act against the mandates of the Liaison Commission;
threats to disallow payments and to redirect raw materials from the Companies in order to ensure
that their actions conform to the interests of Venezuela; and threats to take the companies by the
Venezuelan National Guard.°°* Likewise, Venezuelan officials have occupied the offices of the
Companies, requested thousands of requests for information, obligated to pay indemnity payments
to members of the Liaison Commission and to the special administrators and the requirement to

notify decisions on operational and labor matters, interfering in these decisions.*”

 

2. Respondent’s Position

501. | Venezuela maintains that it has not breached the provisions of Article IV of the BIT on fair and
equitable treatment.

502. Venezuela first argues that Claimants have failed to make a claim for prima facie fair and equitable
treatment. They have failed to explain which acts or measures, in addition to those constituting
an expropriation, have independently breached the standard of fair and equitable treatment.°! The
basis for the two claims must be different, and Claimants cannot simply mechanically repeat the

facts supporting their expropriation claims.°

503. According to Venezuela, BIT requires that the standard of fair and equitable treatment be dispensed
“in accordance with international law”, which is the minimum standard of treatment. Tribunals
continue to apply this minimum standard of treatment, and while it has evolved, the threshold for
establishing a breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment remains high.’ Venezuela
maintains that it must be shown that there was a clear breach of the minimum standard of treatment
accorded to foreigners and their assets under international law.

504. Venezuela refers to Glamis Gold v. United States to define the minimum standard of treatment
under customary international law. It also quotes Neer v. Mexico to argue that the minimum
standard of treatment has been breached if there is conduct amounting to an outrage, in bad faith,
a deliberate disregard for duty, or an insufficiency of governmental action so far from
international standards that any reasonable and impartial man could easily acknowledge as
insufficient”.©® Claimants argue that the common sense of the terms of the BIT does not refer to
the mini standard of However, | intains that nothing in the BIT links
the fair and equitable standard of treatment with a “stand-alone” standard or the components that
Claimants seek to incorporate.”

 

505. Venezuela also argues that Claimants cannot qualify NAFTA cases as irrelevant because their
analysis of the minimum standard of treatment reflects international law.©*.It quotes Professor
Paparinskis, according to whom “[the] ordinary meaning of fair and equitable treatment’ refers
directly to the minimum standard provided by customary international law, even if the process or
object of reference is not explicitly specific in the treaty at issue. However, even if that assertion
was not entirely persuasive, the minimum standard must nevertheless ‘be taken into account’ as a
‘relevant rule of international law’ in accordance with Article 31(3)(c) of the [Vienna Convention],
which plays an important role in the construction process (‘together with the context’, under the
heading of Article 31(3))".

506. It also highlights that Professor Schreuer, Claimants’ expert in responding to Venezuela’s
jurisdictional objections, considers that when treaties refer to international law in their fair and
equitable treatment clauses, customary law must be taken into account upon construing those
clauses. Professor Schreuer agreed with the NAFTA Free Trade’s Commission construction
because the heading of Article 1105(1) is “minimum standard of treatment”, but also because the
text of the clause established an explicit relationship between fair and equitable treatment and
international law. Although Professor Schreuer indicates that the conclusion reached in the
NAFTA context would not necessarily be applicable in the context of other treaties lacking these
features, the treaty at issue before the tribunal does have the important characteristic pointed out
by Professor Schreuer: there is a direct link between fair and equitable treatment and international

law, specified in the very sentence of this clause.°"’

507. Venezuela points out that Claimants minimize the important contribution of the jurisprudence
quoted by Venezuela that is not from NAFTA®” and refers to Genin v. Estonia and M.C.I. Power
Group v. Ecuador in support of its argument that the standard of fair and equitable treatment

 

 

 

necessarily incorporates the mini standard of provided by y
law.

508. Furtt the mini dards of is not comparable to the dard:
of fair and equitable treatment. Claimants do not define with specificity what “autonomous
standard” means.°!? In any case, the mini level of is a mini nota i
and especially not a potpourri of standards arranged and selectively chosen to obtain the desired
result,°!4

509. Venezuela also argues that the import of one standards of fair and equitable treatment from another
treaty is not appropriate. To the extent that the standard of fair and equitable treatment corresponds
to the minimum standard of treatment under international law, and even if the Agreement did not
specifically include an express reference to international law, the meaning of standard would not
change, even if the tribunal could and would decide to import the text of another treaty‘!
Venezuela contends, however, that Claimants’ arguments about “importing” a treaty with more
favorable terms are ungrounded. International tribunals have taken the view that provisions
specifically negotiated by the contracting parties cannot be circumvented by a most-favored-nation
clause.*"* In addition, the legislative history of the BIT Approval Bill does not provide any
additional support for this argument, since it only states that the most-favored-nation clause
“reinforces the standard of fair and equitable treatment”.°"’ Claimants have also failed to prove
that Venezuela has accorded other foreign investors in similar circumstances more favorable
treatment than Claimants, which is a requirement for filing a claim under the most-favored-nation
clause.‘'®

510. | However, even if an autonomous standard were applied in this case, Claimants have not proven
that Venezuela’s measures have deprived Claimants of the benefits of their investments, that
Venezuela has treated Claimants in a manner that is discriminatory, arbitrary, contrary to due
process or the principle of good faith, or that Venezuela has exercised coercion and harassment.

511. Venezuela argues that in no case have the owners been deprived of the ownership of their
investment, nor have they diminished its commercial value or impeded its operation. No
Venezuelan authority has prohibited the distribution of dividends, the approval of balance sheets
and financial statements, and the performance of other acts mentioned by Claimants.*!? Unlike the
case of Achmea v. Slovakia, invoked by Claimants, what happened in this case was that due to the
restrictions on the seizure imposed in the criminal proceedings against Mr. Fernandez Barrueco
(where the State exercises its police power), on a temporary basis, certain acts at law cannot be
formalized and authenticated, without judicial authorization. Claimants have not disputed that the

judge may modify the measures or authorize the formalization of specific acts at the request of the
interested parties. Claimants have not demonstrated that they attempted to declare dividends or
seek a judicial authorization to register any act relating to them.°?!

512. According to Venezuela, arbitrary conduct is “intentional contempt of due process of law, an
action that outrages or at least surprises, a sense of legal correctness”*™ or “voluntary departure
from due process, an act that impresses, or at least surprises, the notion of what is legally
appropriate ”.©*

513. Venezuela maintains that the seizure and special administration measures were not arbitrary
because they do have factual and juridical basis." They have factual basis because the evidence
submitted by the prosecutor’s office to the judge at their request, because of the evidence of the
link between Mr. Fernandez Barrueco and RFB Holdings in November and December 2009, and
because the State exercised the judicial power to adopt precautionary measures in a criminal
proceeding, being expressly empowered by law. The judge concluded that the only way in which
it was possible to safeguard the value of Mr. Fernandez Barrueco’s shares was to protect and
safeguard the equity and value of the Companies as a whole.®° Furthermore, it is justified that the
measures have been applied to the companies as a whole and not only to the fraction of the
shareholding of the defendant. Also, Mr. Fernandez Barrueco’s right, through Rotch, to recover
Claimants’ shares — a right that was in effect at the time the measures were issued — provides a
reasonable basis for validly ordering the seizure.°?? :

514. Claimants’ arguments are formally inadmissible because in substance they constitute a claim of
denial of justice, which has sought to be presented simply as common breach of the standard of
fair and equitable treatment, when the requirement of use up of local remedies has not been met.°*
Venezuela has demonstrated that Claimants could have used suitable domestic remedies to nullify
or amend the allegedly arbitrary or unjustified effects of the measures.*” On the other hand,
Claimants have not proven that the remedies available to them were futile.

515. Regarding the origin and basis of the measures, and the reasons why they are not discriminatory,
Venezuela reiterates the arguments it used to respond the claim of expropriation.°

516. Venezuela also argues that Decree No. 7.394 was not arbitrary and that Claimants overlook the
context in which it was formulated.*! Venezuela has refuted Claimants’ history that Venezuela
created the situation that made necessary the expropriation of the companies. Measures taken by
the Government to address the food crisis were imposed on the entire sector.” In addition, there
is no obligation to treat every company operating in the country in exactly the same way, and
international law allows for justified government actions, as in this case." With respect to the

517. To the extent that there has been no expropriation, Claimants have not been obligated to forcefully
transfer all of their assets. There mere issuance of Decree No. 7.394 did not have the effect of
depriving the ownership or impose a substantial limitation.*°°

518. In addition, Venezuela has not breached the standard of fair and equitable treatment for conduct
contrary to due process. Venezuela emphasizes that arbitral tribunals are not appeal tribunals for
any administrative irregularity,*” and quotes the tribunal in AES v. Hungary to argue that: “not all
Failures of imperfections in a process shall prevent fair and equitable treatment. The rule is not
perfect. It can be said that the rule has been breached only when the procedural acts or omissions
ofa state are manifestly unfair or unreasonable in relation to the facts and context before the judge
(in such a way as to shock or at least surprise the sense of legal correctness) ".°*

519. It has not been proven that there has been improper intervention by any body of the Venezuelan
State in the third party proceedings (incidente de tercerias). Claimants quote the account of their
- witness, Homero Huerta, of information he received from his lawyers in a referential, speculative
and ungrounded manner.” Besides, the judge did not ignore any evidence in the procedure.
With respect to the claim of denial of justice, Venezuela argues that there is no fundamentally
unfair procedure or blatantly wrong decisions in this case that can be considered a breach.™! Within
criminal proceedings, the only decision so far issued was in favor of the accused, and is under
appeal, while the duration of the appeal proceedings in the third party proceeding (incidente de
tercerias) is reasonable.“ Furthermore, the use up of internal remedies is a general principle in
any case of denial of procedural justice.“

520. Regarding the negotiation process, Venezuela maintains that since the publication of Decree No.
7.394, the Parties have developed uninterrupted negotiations in which they have analyzed and
discussed various scenarios for a potential agreement; that the suspension of the expropriation
process was by common agreement precisely to allow for the development of the negotiations; that
Claimants’ account ignores the complexity of the negotiations and is false when it refers to the
alleged threats of coercion; that, in addition, it should be taken into account that at the end of 2011,
the essence and nature of the negotiations between the Parties changed, as ye possibility of
creating two joint ventures began to be idered; that Gruma’s
contradict the position of Claimants in this arbitration on the state of the negotiation between the
Parties; and that in October 2013, the Parties agreed to continue the conversations in a confidential
manner and that, indeed, they were continuing as of the date of their Rejoinder.“* Venezuela also
argues that it has not exercised coercion or harassment, and so Claimants’ statements to that effect
are denied by witnesses Nelson Alba, Johabner Parra and Hairo Arellano.

3. Analysis of the Tribunal

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that there is no objection to its jurisdiction specifically
referring to the claim of breach of Article IV of the BIT.
Claimants contend that V | unfair and equi of their
investments in breach of Article IV of the BIT. On the other hand, Venezuela allege that Claimants
have not made a claim for fair and equitable treatment prima facie; it disputes the standard
proposed by Claimants and, in any event, denies that their actions are contrary to the obligation to
provide fair and equitable treatment under the Treaty. The Tribunal shall refer to the arguments of
the Parties in that order.

First, the Tribunal does not share Venezuela’s position that Claimants cannot base their claim for
fair and equitable treatment on the same facts on which they base their claim for expropriation.
None of the authorities quoted by the Respondent backs its position. On the contrary, international
tribunals have accepted that the same facts that constitute an expropriation may entail breaches of
other standards of protection under the respective treaty.°¢

For example, the tribunal of BCB v. Belize noted:

“As an initial issue, the Tribunal does not accept that-a behavior that breaches one of
the protections of the Treaty, cannot breach other provisions of the same treaty. The
Treaty add the general objective of ‘creating di for greater
investment’ among States parties through the protection of investments by articulating
a set of standards of protection in more or less general terms. The protection established
in this way is intended to be cumulative. Nothing in the Treaty supports Respondent’s
claim that the standards of the Treaty are alternative to each other, so that a breach of
any would prevent the breach of another. Rather, each of the standards set out in the
Treaty expresses a particular aspect of the general purpose of investment protection. Its
potentially overlapping application reflects this complementarity”.“”

The Tribunal considers that the same analysis applies to the Treaty on which Claimants’ claims in
this arbitration are based. To the extent that the same conduct may breach several provisions of the
Treaty, nothing prevents Claimants from basing their remaining claims on the same facts invoked
in connection with their expropriation claim.

Although this is not the case before this Tribunal, accepting Venezuela’s position would lead to
the conclusion that an investor cannot file a subsidiary claim for breach of the standard of fair and
equitable treatment in the vent that the corresponding tribunal does not find evidence of
expropriation. In this hypothetical scenario, if the investor errs in the legal qualification of the facts
subject of the process in his main claim, he would be devoid of redress even if the acts of the State
are contrary to some standard of protection under the treaty over which the investor also submits
a claim.

The same fact or situation may constitute a breach of different provisions of a treaty, and unless
otherwise provided, the corresponding tribunal may exercise its jurisdiction to examine and decide
on the breaches invoked provided they have been duly alleged. In this case, Claimants provided an
independent analysis of the reasons why they believe Venezuela’s measures breach Article IV(1)
of the Treaty on Fair and Equitable Treatment. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot accept Venezuela’s
defense that Claimants failed to articulate a claim for fair and equitable treatment prima facie.

528. Second, the Parties discuss the standard of fair and equitable treatment under the Treaty.
Specifically, they discuss whether the reference to “International Law” in Article IV(1) of the BIT
points out that the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment equals the minimum standard
of treatment under customary international law.

529. Article IV(1) of the Treaty provides that “each Contracting Party shall ensure in its territory fair
and equitable , in de with I ional Law, to i made by ii
of the other Contracting Party”.

530. The Tribunal considers that the standard of fair and equitable treatment enshrined in this treaty
cannot be equated with the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.
Indeed, BIT makes no reference to the “minimum standard of treatment” and the Tribunal finds no
reason to construe the reference to “International Law” in that sense either.

531. Other international investment tribunals that have construed similar clauses in treaties other than
NAFTA“ have reached the same conclusion. For example, the tribunal of Vivendi v. Argentina
JI, upon construing the expression “in accordance with the principles of international law” in
Article 3 of the bilateral investment treaty between France and Argentina — noted the following:

“The Tribunal finds no basis for equating the principles of international law with the
minimum standard of treatment. First, the reference to the principles of international
law supports a broader construction that entails considering a margin of principles of
international law broader than just the minimum standard. Second, according to the
wording of Article 3, fair and equitable treatment must be in accordance with the
principles of international law, but this requirement of conformity can serve both as a
minimum and maximum limit to the fair and equitable treatment standard of the Treaty.
Third, the words of the provision indicate that contemporary principles of international

law must also be taken into account, not just the principle of almost a century ago”.?

532. The tribunal of Total v. Argentina also reached the same conclusion:

“In the Tribunal’s view, the phrase ‘fair and equitable treatment in accordance with the
principles of international law’ cannot be read as ‘treatment required by the minimum
standard of treatment of foreigners/investors under international law’. This is
irrespective of the issue of whether there really exists today a difference between this
traditional minimum standard and what international law generally requires in terms of
the treatment of foreign investors and their investments”.°°

533. In any event, the Tribunal notes that the concept of “minimum standard of treatment” under
international law has developed significantly since its earliest definitions. For example, the tribunal
of RDC v. Guatemala noted that “the minimum standard of treatment is ‘constantly in a process
of development’ form its formulation in Neer”.§*'

534. —Inasimilar sense, the tribunal of Pope & Talbot v. Canada (Damages Award) recognized that “the
range of actions subject to the international arena has expanded beyond the international breaches
considered in Neer to include the concept of fair and equitable treatment”.®?

8 The Tribunal notes that NAFTA expressly includes the minimum standard of treatment and, therefore, other tribunals’

constructions of the “fair and equitable treatment” clause of that treaty cannot automatically extend to this BIT.

535. Thus, based on the remarks of different tribunals regarding the evolution of the minimum standard
of treatment in international law, the tribunal of Azurix v. Argentina noted that:

“The minimum requirements to meet this [minimum] standard have varied, and the
Tribunal understands that its content is substantially similar, whether the terms are
construed according to their current meaning, as required by the Vienna Convention or
under customary international law”.°?

536. The Tribunal agrees with the opinion of this tribunal and of other tribunals that have reached the
same conclusion.*™ Indeed, the concept of “minimum standard of treatment” has been expanded
to such an extent that it now provides protection very similar to that accorded under the standard
of fair and equitable treatment. Accordingly, the discussion raised lacks practical effect in this case,
since the level of protection afforded to investments protected under the Treaty is substantially the
same, regardless of how the refe to 1 Law” ined in Article IV(1) of the BIT
is construed.

537. In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to refer to Claimants’
alternative argument that the provisions on fair and equitable treatment of other bilateral
investment treaties entered into by Venezuela which do not refer to “International Law” in relation
to that obligation should be applied through the most-favored-nation clause.

538. Article 1V(1) of the Treaty is to be construed in accordance with the rule of construction of Article
31(1) of the Vienna Convention. In its current sense, the terms “fair” and “equitable” mean
“according to justice and reason”*> and “having equity”*’, namely, having “equality of mind”.°”
In their context, the terms “fair and equitable” refer to the treatment that the Contracting States
undertook to guarantee to the investments of the investors of the other Contracting State.
According to numeral 2 of the same Article IV, such treatment may not be less favorable than that
granted to the investments of its own investors or those of third States. In view of the purpose and
aim of the Treaty, as arisen from its preamble, this treatment should be aimed at creating favorable
conditions for protected investments.

539. From the construction and application that different arbitral tribunals have given to the obligation
to grant fair and equitable treatment, some elements commonly accepted as part of the standard
arise. These components include, inter alia, the obligation not to act in an arbitrary or
discriminatory manner,** abide by due process and to act in a consistent and transparent
manner. It has also been und d that “the g of fair and equitabl. [...] is
an expression and constitutive part of the principle of good faith recognized by international law”
and must therefore be construed in light of such principle.' In any case, as established by the
tribunal of Mondev. v. USA, the decision of what is fair and equitable shall depend on the facts of
each specific case.

540. To the necessary extent, the Tribunal shall refer to the elements identified above for the purpose
of assessing Claimants’ claim. However, the Tribunal shall not proceed to determine, on a case-
by-case basis, whether the State breached one or more components of the standard. On the contrary,
the Tribunal shall examine all the facts and circumstances submitted to their consideration in order
to establish whether or not the action of the State, taken as a whole, conforms to the standard of
conduct required by Article IV(1) of the Treaty. This, insofar as Claimants’ allegation would
appear to point out that it was the aggregate of measures adopted by Venezuela that resulted in the
breach of Article IV(1) of the Treaty.“

541. Indeed, Claimants contend that Venezuela unfairly and inequitably treated their investments by
implementing and maintaining a series of measures on Monaca and Demaseca that have deprived
them of the basic benefits of their investments. Specifically, the complain that, as a result of the
seizure and special administration measures and Decree No. 7.394, Claimants are unable to
distribute dividends, approve financial statements, to appoint or remove directors or managers, to
sell their shares in the Companies or to dispose of their assets.5°*

542. Based on the decision of Achmea v. Slovakia, Claimants allege that the adverse effect of the
measures — that is, the impediment to receiving the basic benefits of their investments — would be
sufficient to conclude that Venezuela breached its obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment
under the Treaty. In any case, they claim that the measures are also contrary to this standard of
protection. :

543. | The Tribunal considers that the adverse effect of a measure or series of measures is not sufficient
to conclude that the State failed to comply with its obligation to ensure fair and equitable treatment
of investments protected under the Treaty. To reach this conclusion, the Tribunal shall have to find

id that the Ives or viewed in conjunction with the other circumstances of
the cases, are contrary to the standard of fair and equitable treatment.

544. In this case, it is proven that, as of 2009, Venezuela imposed seizure and special administration
measures on Monaca and Demaseca arisen from the criminal proceedings against Mr. Fernandez
Barrueco, alleged shareholder of the Companies. These measures include the SAREN circular —
which ordered the Public Registries, Mercantile Registries and Notaries to refrain from formalizing
or authenticating acts or legal affairs in which the Claimants or the Companies - and the
appointment of special administrators empowered, in general, to exercise actions tending to
guarantee the possession, safeguard, custody, use and conservation of the assets of the Companies
and, in particular, to guard their banking assets.°’ Under this regime, bank movements of
Companies must be approved by special administrators.

545. The third party proceeding (incidente de tercertas) initiated by Claimants to request the lifting of
the measures was denied in the first instance in November 2010 and, at the date of the last
submission of the Parties before this Tribunal, Claimants’ appeal against that decision had not yet
been admitted. Accordingly, the seizure and special administration measures remain in force.

546. On the other hand, in May 2010, Venezuela issued Decree No. 7.394 by which it ordered the
initiation of an expropriation process of certain assets of Monaca. After the issuance of the Decree,
Venezuela imposed a Liaison Commission on Monaca and Demaseca. Although Venezuela alleges

that the Liaison Commission resulted from an agreement between the Parties, there is no reliable
evidence of such agreement on the record. The expropriation process was suspended in August
2010 to give rise to “friendly negotiations” between the Parties which, however, have not made
significant progress and whose interlocutor, as far as Venezuela is concerned, has change several
times without further explanation.

547. _ Inspite of the suspension of the expropriation process — which, according to Respondent- is barely
at the outset — Respondent has understood and made known to the Companies, that Decree No.
7.394 imposes conservation obligations and certain restrictions on the goods covered by Decree,“
namely, those used for the operation of Monaca or for the large-scale production, agro-industrial
processing and storage of certain goods. For example, Respondent has pointed out that Claimants
may not perform acts that entail that the Companies’ property is destroyed or become “unable to
comply with the purpose for which it is being appropriated”. According to Venezuela’s own
expert, these acts would include (i) changing its corporate purpose; (ii) changing or eliminating a
line of business; (iii) ceasing to make investments to keep its factories and equipment operating;
and (iv) ing its hinery and equip from V | A ding to the same expert,
Claimants may transfer the property, but the “decree of affectation” shall pursue it wherever it is.”
These restrictions would be maintained until there is a definitive agreement regarding the
acquisition of all or part of the Companies or until Venezuela directly expropriates the assets
subject to Decree.

 

 

548. In the meantime, it has been demonstrated that SIEX did not process the applications for
registration or updating of foreign investment filed by Monaca and Valores between 2000 and
2013," a situation that prevents Claimants from complying with one of the requirements
demanded by the laws of that State to transfer money abroad. In addition. Venezuela has ordered
the redirection of raw material owned by the Companies to other companies in the sector.

549. Having established the scope of the measures imposed on Monaca and Demaseca, the Tribunal
shall now determine whether, as Claimants have argued, these measures or their implementation
are contrary to the State’s duty to ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments protected
under the Treaty.

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 114 of 375

Claimants contend that the seizure and special administration measures are arbitrary and
disproportionate. It is then for the Tribunal to determine whether in their genesis or in their
execution, or both, the aforementioned measures meet the standard of arbitrariness and
disproportion alleged by Claimants.

Claimants complain that, when the seizure and special administration measures were decreed, the
judge who heard the third party proceedings (incidente de tercerias) brought by them to revoke
them, ignored evidence that would demonstrate that Mr. Fernandez Barrueco had no interest in
Monaca and Demaseca, and furthermore, confirmed the measures over all of the Companies
despite the fact that the interest of the accused party therein was minority and indirect. They also
allege that Venezuela’s action in relation to the third party proceeding (incidente de tercerias) was
contrary to the guarantee of due process and constitutes a denial of procedural justice.

With regard to the first item, the Tribunal notes that, in its decision of November 19, 2011 — which
upheld the judgment of December 4, 2009 that underlies the seizure and special administration
measures imposed on Monaca and Demaseca — the criminal judge concluded that by the date on
which the precautionary measures were issued, Mr. Fernandez Barrueco had shareholdings in
Monaca and Demaseca, and that the only way to safeguard the value of his interest in these
companies was to extend the precautionary measures to all of the Companies.

The first thing to note is-that it is not for this Tribunal to serve as appellate judge of the Venezuelan
judge’s decision, nor to reassess the evidence submitted in the third party proceeding (incidente de
tercerias) brought by Claimants to determine whether, under applicable law, a different
construction of the law or a different assessment of the evidence would apply. It is a peaceful issue
investment tribunals that these are not appellate tribunals and, in that sense, the commission of an
error of fact or law by a domestic tribunal is not, per se, a breach of the standard of fair and
equitable treatment.©© What happens in this case is Claimants’ disagreement with the

p 's judge’s of the evid and ion of the law under Venezuelan
law, a disagreement that is not for this Tribunal to resolve.

A different matter is the performance of the Venezuelan judicial system from the point of view of
the process itself. Issued the seizure by the criminal judge, which was initially referred to the shares
of Mr. Fernandez Berrueco in the Ce the p ’s office req d on D ber 3,

2009 the ion of the to the Companies and the appoii of

managers.” The judge resolved the request one day later, on December 4, 2009, granting the
petition.

  

The third party proceeding (incidente de tercerias) was initiated by Claimants on February 1, 2010
and resolved in the first instance, unfavorably to Claimants, on November 19, 2010, that is, ten
months after the filing date of the application. Claimants filed an appeal against that decision on
December 6, 2010.

At this point, the Tribunal should note, and the Parties’ experts accepted that what followed for the
admission of the appeal was a simple procedure that does not require further legal or evidentiary
analysis.°”* It was simply a matter of issuing an order as to whether or not the appeal was admissible
or not. The decision did not entail resolving the merits of the appeal or reviewing the alleged errors
of the trial judge, but simply determine whether the appeal met the formalities and requirements

for admission. Venezuelan law provides for a short term — between three and five days” - for the
judge to decide on the admissibility of the appeal. However, more than six years have lapsed since
the filing of the appeal and there is no evidence that the appeal has been admitted.

557. Respondent has sought to justify the delay in the complexity of the matter and the congestion of
the Venezuelan judicial system and the fact that a conflict of jurisdiction arose that had to be
resolved previously.*! The tribunal cannot accept these justifications. First, as noted above, it was
not a question of resolving the appeal, but simply of deciding whether the appeal was admissible.
The Venezuelan legal experts of both parties distort the complexity alleged by Venezuela. The
allegation of congestion in the Venezuelan judicial system is also unsatisfactory. It is sufficient to
note that, within the same procedure, resolutions of other more complex issues such as the
extension of the measures to the Companies or the first instance decision of the third party
proceeding (incidente de tercerias) took substantially less time (one day and about ten months,
respectively).

558. As for the conflict of jurisdiction, the term provided for in Venezuelan law to resolve it is not only
short (24 hours) but must be decided “in preference to any other matter”.°* The decision on the
conflict of jurisdiction took almost four years. Indeed, the conflict was raised by the trial judge on
January 17, 2011 and was declared non-existent on October 8, 2014. As of the date of this
Award, that is, more than six years after the filing of the appeal on December 6, 2010, and more
than two years from the decision of the alleged conflict of jurisdiction, it is not proven there-is a
decision on its admission, let alone that it has been resolved.

559. Inthe meantime, seizure on Monaca and Demaseca, based on the alleged interest of Mr. Fernandez
Barrueco in the capital of the Companies, continued to be executed by Venezuelan officials,

through and ions that indistinctly involved p y
the provisions of the Decree and those arising out of food policies, as discussed below.

560. _ Finally, the Tribunal notes that the restriction on leaving the country was lifted by the judge without
the prosecutor’s office objecting such decision. A few days later, the criminal case against Mr.
Fernandez Barrueco was dismissed the judge, tov which the prosecutor’s office filed an appeal.
Asa 1 the pi the C ies remain in force and, in
principle, would not be lifted until the prosecutor’s office’s appeal against the act declaring the
dismissal of the case is resolved.5**

561. Based on the allegations of the Parties on this item, and in particular taking into account the
testimony of Dr. Velazquez at the Hearing,“ the Tribunal finds that there is at least a serious doubt
that the criminal process — and accordingly — the determination on the validity of the precautionary
measures — could continue in case of Mr. Fernandez Barrueco is definitively absent from the
country.

562. In short, as mentioned above and as shall be discussed below, the actions of officers of the
executive and judiciary power of the Respondent have caused the seizure measures— which
according to Venezuela have a transitory nature and constitute the legitimate basis of the situation

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 116 of 375

to which the Companies and Claimants have been exposed — (i) to be confused with those arising
from the ongoing expropriation process and those relating to food policy, despite the formal
separation alleged by Respondent; (ii) to have an unacceptable indetermination as to their duration;
(iii) to interfere with the normal operation of the Companies without clear rules as to the applicable
provisions and scope of functions of those who were and who are permanently located on the
premises of the Companies; and (iv) to deny the Claimants a real possibility of disputing the merits
of the seizure before a judge other than the one who ordered them.

 

 

563. Under these circumstances and for the reasons noted above, Venezuela’s action with respect to the
precautionary measures, becomes incompatible with the State’s obligation to provide fair and
equitable treatment to Claimants’ investments.

564. Claimants also allege that Decree No. 7.394 is arbitrary and discriminatory, that its execution is
also arbitrary, and that Venezuela acted in bad faith in the negotiations that followed the suspension
of the expropriation proceedings.

565. The Tribunal has already determined that Decree No. 7.394 — whether analyzed as a single measure
or as part of the set of measures complained by Claimants — did not result in an expropriation. This
is a legal provision that initiates the expropriation process under Venezuelan law. With respect to
Decree No. 7.394 the Tribunal shall proceed to determine whether, in the conduct of Venezuela
subsequent to the issuance of the Decree, acts of Venezuela that qualify as breaches to the standard
of fair and equitable treatment provided for in the BIT arose, as Claimants allege.

566. Asa starting point, the Tribunal notes that Decree No. 7.394 only refers to Monaca. The Parties
dispute whether or not Demaseca is included in the scope of the Decree. Evidence shows that
Monaca and Demaseca are different legal entities but that they functioned as the same economic
unit®” and that certain Venezuelan actions arisen from the Decree were extended to Demaseca.***

567. It is not in dispute that on August 17, 2010, the Vice President of the Republic instructed the
Attorney General’s Office to suspend the procedure of expropriation of Monaca to begin
negotiations for the amicable acquisition of assets affected by Decree No. 7.394. Nor is it
disputed that the negotiations conducted between the Parties since the issuance of the Decree also
included Demaseca.°

687 Gruma’s documents point out that Monaca absorbed Demaseca’s production in 2007 (See GRUMA, Situation of Monaca and
Demaseca (2014) (Exhibi R-l 20)). Indeed, the evidence in the file indicates that i in August 2006 Monaca and Demaseca entered
into a “Temporary i as part ofa “ process” prior to the projected
merger between both Companies (See MONACA-DEMASECA Temporary Association Agreement, August 1, 2006 (Exhibit C-
26)). Johabner Parra, Respondent's witness, pointed out that “f...] administratively and operationally, DEMASECA functions as
one more MONACA plant”. “Testimony of Johabner Parra of March 4, 2015, { 11. See also, Day 2, Tr. 390:4-20).

688 Venezuelan officers understood that Decree No. 7.394 extends to Demaseca’s property (See Directive No. 050-11 from Minister
C. Osorio Zambrano (Ministry of Food) to President H. Chavez Frias (Presidency of the Republic), December 20, 2011 (Exhibit
R-051)). Venezuela named “mirrors” of the Liaison Commission of both Monaca and Demaseca (See Exhibit C-191). At the
Hearing, one of Respondent's witnesses confirmed that the members of the Liaison Commission were present at Demaseca’s
premises (Hearing, Day 2, a 390:4-7). All of the above is consistent with Gruma’s assertions in its Annual Reports regarding the
scope of the Demaseca Decree. (See, for example, GRUMA, 2012 GRUMA Annual Report, 2012, page 117 (Exhibit R-053);
GRUMA, 2011 Annual Report, April 30, 2012, page 14 (Exhibit R-059)).

568. The Parties discuss whether Venezuela unilaterally decided to suspend the proceedings or whether
it did so at the request of the Claimants. Claimants complain that Venezuela has delayed and
hindered negotiations within the amicable settlement process, to the detriment of investors.

569. In the Tribunal’s view, the discussion of how the proceedings were suspended is not decisive in
this context. Regardless of who made this decision and whether or not the suspension of the
expropriation is valid under Venezuelan law, it was demonstrated in this arbitration that
Venezuelan officials have construed and construe that the expropriation process is suspended, but
that Decree No. 7.394 continues to apply and that it imposes certain limitations on the disposal of
the Companies’ assets by Claimants, but allows the use of other assets not subject to food policy,
and that such limitations shall not cease until there is a final agreement regarding the acquisition
ofall or part of the Companies, or until the effects of the Decree cease as a result of a court decision,
or until Venezuela resumes the expropriation process and directly expropriates the assets subject
to the Decree."

570. — Inthis context, the Tribunal considers it essential to examine the manner in which the expropriation
process has proceeded, the negotiations leading to the transfer of the Companies to Respondent
and the application of Decree No. 7.394 in the meantime.

571. With regard to negotiations, the Tribunal notes that the Appraisal Commission appointed by
mutual agreement of the Parties delivered the appraisal of the assets and property rights of both
Companies on September 23, 2010.°” On that date, the Parties agreed on a “negotiation price” to
finalize a definitive agreement for the purchase of all the shares of Monaca and Demaseca.®*
Subsequently, a review of the financial statements of the Companies as of October 31, 2010 was
requested by a firm of public accountants; however, none of the Parties submitted the result of
such review to this arbitration.

572. Following that first appraisal, the Claimants submitted three proposals for the acquisition of all or
part of their shareholding in the Companies.°°> However, there is no evidence on the record to
indicate that Venezuela responded to the first two proposals. Indeed, Mr. Hairo Arellano,
Respondent’s witness, confirmed at the Hearing that Venezuela had not responded to these offers
nor made a counteroffer. The third proposal, which took the form of a “Commitment Deed”,
became ineffective due to the expiration of the provided term, without any significant progress in
the negotiations.

573. The Tribunal also notes that the negotiations have come to a halt on a number of occasions without
substantial progress in defining the situation. Indeed, the evidence indicates that the negotiations

were halted in early 2012, resumed at the end of 2013 and continued at least until 2014.%7
Claimants assert that negotiations have not progressed since then®*® and Respondent has not
provided evidence to the contrary.

574. In summary, having discussed, but not agreed upon, possible acquisition amounts of the
Companies, Claimants have attempted to advance the negotiation process on several occasions and
have not received a response from Venezuela.” In addition, Respondent has transferred
responsibility for negotiations with Claimants from one official to another and from one state
agency to another, at least four times, without further justification, thereby creating additional
interruptions and delays in the process.’

575. Venezuela has argued that Claimants should have exercised the judicial or administrative remedies
available under Venezuelan law to demand resumption of the expropriation process or to request
the revocation of the Decree if they considered the continuation of the negotiations to be contrary
to their interests. The Tribunal does not share that view.

576. It is not in dispute that the Treaty does not impose an obligation to investors to exhaust domestic
remedies before resorting to an international tribunal to settle their disputes with the State. In
addition, taking into account the particular circumstances of this case, Respondent cannot claim
that interferences are made or consequences arise contrary to the position held by Claimants in this
arbitration for not having initiated judicial or administrative actions in Venezuela in relation to the
suspension of the expropriation process.

 

577. Decree No. 7.394 provides that the Attorney General’s Office is the entity in charge of processing
the expropriation procedure provided for in the Expropriation Law (Ley de Expropiaci6n) until the
affected property is transferred to the State.”' In addition, this law establishes that the
responsibility for initiating the judicial expropriation process corresponds to the Administration.””
In this sense, Respondent’s own Venezuelan legal expert confirmed at the Hearing that it is the
State” that determines when the negotiation process “has reached an impasse”. Besides, the
referred expert acknowledged that the suspension of the expropriation procedure would not be
justified in the absence of negotiations between the Parties.”

578. In the Tribunal’s view, Respondent’s reasons do not justify a delay of almost ten years in the
completion of the expropriation proceedings initiated under Decree No. 7.394, regardless of which
act terminates its effects.

579. While it is true that the Venezuelan legal system provides resources to make up for the
Administration’s lack of activity, Claimants are not bound to initiate an expropriation process
against them, especially when this responsibility falls on the State according to its own legislation.
The State cannot suspend an expropriation process, apply some of the effects of the decree that
initiated the expropriation process, delay the negotiations and simultaneously argue that it was up
to the Claimants to promote through legal actions the expropriation process in order to force
Venezuela to comply with the obligations that it was unaware of.

580. In any event, it is not true that Claimants have remained unmoved by Venezuela’s conduct. As
explained, Claimants attempted to put an end to the situation that afflicts them by multiple requests
of resumption of the negotiations that were not addressed by Respondent. Indeed, the
“Commitment Deed” provided as part of the negotiations between the Parties, Claimants formally
requested Venezuela to revoke Decree No. 7.394 and lift the seizure and special administration
measures on the Companies.””> However, Respondent refused to grant such requests.’°

581. Finally, the Tribunal notes that Decree No. 7.394 qualifies as “urgent” the execution of the
“Agroindustrial Processing Capacity Consolidation for the Venezuela of the XXI Century”
program, through the use of goods affected by Decree that, in addition, would be “essential” for
its execution.” The delay in the acquisition of goods by Venezuela — whether through purchase
and sale or through direct expropriation and indemnification — is not compatible with the urgency
invoked in the Decree and denotes a lack of coherence between the reasons expressed in said rule
and the consequent action of the State.

582. In conclusion, Venezuela initiated a process of expropriation, considered that it imposed
limitations on the operation of the Companies by Claimants, and subsequently suspended the
process and has maintained it suspended for several years, while State officials execute acts and
apply measures based on the construction that the Decree imposes certain restrictions or prior
authorization requirements for the operation of the Companies. Claimants are, thus, in a situation
of uncertainty with respect to scenarios ranging from the eventual revocation of the Decree to the
culmination of the expropriation process, and they maintain that indetermination with support in
negotiations that they refuse to pursue.

583. The Tribunal finds that Venezuela by this conduct breached its obligation to ensure fair and
equitable treatment of Claimants’ investments by keeping the expropriation process suspended for
nearly ten years, without making decisive progress in the negotiations and, at the same time,
understanding that it applies those effects of Decree No. 7.394 that impose limitations on the
Companies, including restrictions on disposing of certain assets (the assets that according to
Venezuela are covered by the Decree) or performing certain acts (which Venezuela claims are
limited by the application of the Decree).”® To this is added the indefinite situation of Demaseca,
with respect to whom Venezuela maintains that it is a different legal entity, but to whom in fact
measures arisen from the Decree have been applied.

584. Finally, Claimants allege that the Liaison Commission and the special administrators merged de
facto, forming a parallel administration and management regime.” In this regard, the Tribunal
notes that, as alleged by Venezuela and acknowledged by Claimants, the Liaison Commission was
withdrawn from the Companies in September 2013. However, two of its members — who served
as Venezuela’s “mirrors” on the Liaison Commission — were appointed as special administrators
of the Companies and until the date of the Hearing, continued to perform that work.

585. The Tribunal finds that during the stay of the Liaison Commission at the headquarters of the
Companies there was convergence and confusion between the functions corresponding to the
members of such Commission and those exercised by the special administrators,”° although

ding to Vi la itself, their dates were pletely different.

586. Such confusion persisted after the withdrawal of the Liaison Commission. Indeed, if the same
people are initially appointed as members of the Liaison Commission (originating in the Decree),
act in parallel with the special administrators (originating in the criminal process) generating
confusion about the origin and scope of the powers of each one and interfering in the operation of
the Companies and then become special administrators, maintaining in the exercise of their
functions the same confusion, the Respondent cannot invoke in its defense the simple formal
separation of functions. In addition, Venezuelan officials invoked the State’s food policies as
additional justification for the measures implemented by the special administrators, despite the
formal separation between those policies and the criminal proceedings against Mr. Fernandez
Barrueco. If the officials really had totally different powers, as Venezuela claims, that difference
had to take place in practice and give certainty to the Companies about the limitations to which
they might be subject. The mere formal separation, when the practice shows confusion in the
powers of the officer and their execution, is not sufficient to justify Respondent’s performance.
This reflects a lack of coherence and transparency on the part of the State, which is only attributable
to the State.

587. As the Tribunal noted in deciding on the expropriation, the Venezuelan measures and conduct did
not result in the total or substantial loss of control of the Companies by Claimants. However, the
Tribunal considers that there is a breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment due to the
validity of the seizure and special administration measures in the context in which the criminal
process against Mr. Fernandez Barrueco and the third party proceeding (incidente de tercerias) has
advanced, added to the restrictions that according to Venezuela derive from Decree No. 7.394,
while the process of forced acquisition continues to be suspended despite the lack of progress in
the negotiations between the Parties, and the confusion generated and maintained as to the origin
and effect of the powers of the special administrators and, for a significant period of time, between
the special administrators and the Liaison Commission. These measures, in the form in which they
have been executed, created an unjustified burden on the Companies and imposed restrictions on
Claimants in the free exercise of their rights as shareholders of those Companies.

588. For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal considers that Venezuela has breached its obligation to
ensure fair and equitable treatment of Claimants’ investments.

1. Claimants’ Position

589. According to Claimants, Venezuela has imposed arbitrary and discriminatory measures contrary
to Article III(1) of the BIT.

590. Claimants allege that in order for this breach to arise, it is only necessary that the hindering
measures are arbitrary or discriminatory.’"! They also consider that the assessment of Venezuela’s
breach of this standard and that of the fair and equitable treatment should be done independently.”

591. | Claimants define an arbitrary act as one that has no factual or legal basis, contrary to the rule of
law or due process.”!? They quote the ELS/ case before the International Court of Justice to define
arbitrary conduct as a “deliberate failure to abide by the due process of law”.’"* They also consider
an act to be achitraty if it is “contrary to justice, reason or the law, [or is] dictated by shall or
whim” or if “is not based on reason facts or law”."'>

592. According to Claimants, Venezuela has implemented measures that breach the obligation
described in Article III(1) of the BIT because they are arbitrary, lacking a legitimate factual or
legal basis or discriminatory in that ny have been applied exclusively to Companies and not to
similar ies, and have hii the
use, enjoyment, extension, sale and Tiquidation of Claimants’ investments.”!¢

 

593. Claimants contend that Venezuela has taken arbitrary, capricious, unlawful and factually and
legally by ining a “special i ion” and other interference
measures in the service of the expropriatory purposes proclaimed in Decree No. 7.394. The appeal
filed by Claimants and Companies against the judge’s decision in the third party proceeding
(incidente de tercertas) has not yet been admitted, although it was filed in December 2010.”"” Also,
Venezuela has applied Article 22 of the Law against Organized Crime (Ley contra la Delincuencia
Organizada), which is applicable to seized or forfeited assets and presupposes the existence of a
final criminal conviction, non-existent in this case.”!8

594. After proving that Mr. Fernandez Barrueco did not hold shares in the Companies, the
representatives of the Republic stated that they were indifferent to who the owners of the
companies were and Venezuela adopted Decree No. 7.394.”!? The imposition of Decree No. 7.394
was also arbitrary because it is not intended to satisfy. an end of public utility or social interest, but
rather the singular expropriation of the Companies.””°

595. The execution of Decree No. 7.394 has been arbitrary for breaching due process, as Venezuelan
law demands that a final judgment be obtained in an expropriation trial and that a fair compensation
be paid to Claimants in order to occupy the Companies. The expropriation process has been
suspended since August 2010. The Liaison Commission is not provided for in the current
Expropriation Law or in Decree No. 7.394.”?!

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 122 of 375

Officials belonging to the Liaison Commission invaded the premises of the Companies and have
progressively obstructed and interfered with them. Venezuela, through SAREN, ordered its
notaries and commercial registries to refrain from authenticating and formalizing minutes of
shareholders’ meetings of the Companies, including those where they appoint members of boards
of directors.” Likewise, the Liaison Commission and the special administrators have prevented
the free develop and administration of the C ies by the dismissal orders
of certain employees, interfered in planning and training workshops to incorporate the vision of
Venezuelan politics, interfered in the decision to change one of the distribution centers of Monaca
in Maracaibo and blocked the authorization of lease payments of the new distribution center,
pressuring Monaca to accept all labor claims of certain unions, interfered in a decision to close an
unprofitable pasta factory and ordered the sale and distribution of corn flour at preferential prices
to “Socialist Bakeries”, inter alia.”

 

Venezuela invokes the decisions in Enron v. Argentina (Award), Sempra v. Argentina and El Paso
v. Argentina, arguing that these courts determined that the measures that the State considers
necessary to address sudden crisis or changing economic circumstances are not arbitrary. However,
Venezuela does not explain the sudden crisis or changing economic circumstance that justifies the
adoption of the drastic measures adopted in this case.’™4

According to Claimants, a measure is discriminatory if the State treats differently, investors in
la would have treated the
Companies differently by imposing Decree No. 7.394, subjecting them to a process of
expropriation that affected all of their assets. These measures have only affected Monaca and
Demaseca, whereas they have not been extended to national competitors such as Alimentos Polar,
C.A. and Cargill V SAR dent has also benefited these tors by giving them
access to Monaca’s raw material through an order to reassign more than 86,000 metric tons of
white corn, owned by the Companies.’”

Claimants contend that Venezuela does not dispute that Alimentos Polar, C.A. and Cargill
Venezuela, S.A. constitute the universe of companies with which the Companies must be compared,
since they are in the same line of business.”’ There is also no reasonable justification for treating
the Companies differently, and Venezuela does not argue otherwise.’*

2. Respondent’s Position

Venezuela alleges that it has not breached the provisions of Article II] of the BIT regarding
arbitrary or discriminatory measures.

According to Venezuela, the jurisprudence of courts in investment arbitrations requires a high
standard of proof to demonstrate that a State acted arbitrarily.” It requires that it be shown that
the action “was completely irrational, devoid of any coherent grounds” or that it “was developed
with reckless disregard for the investor's right”.° Misconduct must be largely self-evident,”*! so

process.’*? This standard is consistent with the provisions in the ELS/ case before the International
Court of Justice.”

602.  Arbitral tribunals have determine that actions are not arbitrary when carried out in compliance with
local laws or when the State deems them necessary to respond to a sudden crisis or changing
economic circumstances.”4 Claimants unduly assimilate the measures adopted in the framework
of a criminal proceeding with regulatory acts, alleging that Venezuela does not explain the sudden
crisis or changing circumstance that justifies the adoption of these measures adopted in this case.”°°
The special management of the Companies has a legitimate legal basis by virtue of the preventive
measures of securing assets decreed by the Eleventh Court on the companies of Mr. Fernandez
Barrueco.” Likewise, Decree No. 7.394 is not arbitrary, since it is based on a purpose of public
utility or social interest, in accordance with the Ley de Seguridad y Soberania Agroalimentaria,
and that all applicable provisions have been respected.” Claimants have only submitted the
opinion of their expert, Dr. Canova, which has been contested by Dr. Velazquez Bolivar. Claimants
have therefore failed to meet the burden in accordance with the requirements of the ELS/ standard
for conduct to be considered arbitrary.

603. Venezuela admits that “the parties agree that a measure is discriminatory when the State provides
(i) different treatment, (ii) to investors in similar circumstance and (iii) without reasonable
Justification”.* Claimants do not explain in what the companies Alimentos Polar, C.A. and
Cargill Venezuela, S.A. would be comparable to Monaca and Demaseca. The Republic has never
admitted that such companies may be compared within the meaning of Article III(1) of the BIT.
The mere fact that they are competitors, because they belong to the food branch, does not place
them in similar circumstances. In any case, they have been the object of governmental measures,
and even expropriation, proving that there is no individualization or persecution of the
Companies.”” Claimants do not answer the argument that Article 3 of the Food Law (Ley
Alimentaria) has been used as the basis for 24 other expropriation decrees affecting 24 other food
companies, or that Venezuela also ordered the redirection of products belonging to other
companies, such as, for example, CAPRI.” Claimants have therefore not proven that the
companies were in similar circumstances or that Venezuela treated the Companies differently.

604. Finally, Venezuela argues that the analysis of the claim on the alleged breach of the standard of
fair and equitable treatment renders unnecessary a separate analysis of the claim on the alleged
arbitrary or discriminatory measures.”' Because Claimants have been unable to prove a breach of
fair and equitable treatment, a claim for arbitrary or discriminatory measures should not be
admitted. In any event, Claimants have failed to prove that their alleged investment was affected
by Venezuela through arbitrary or discriminatory measures.”

35 Analysis of the Tribunal

605. Claimants allege that Venezuela also breached its obligation under Article III(1) of the BIT by
imposing arbitrary and discriminatory measures, which “prevent Claimants to freely enjoy the

benefits of their investments and have impeded the free development, management and
administration of MONACA and DEMASECA in various ways”.”8

606. Venezuela denies that the measures invoked by Claimants are arbitrary or discriminatory and, in

any event, contends that Claimants failed to prove that the measures “have actually prevented the

je ion, sale and liquidation of the

investment” in the sense of proving that “the veal possibility for the exercise of the right at issue
diminished by reason of the measure”.”

607. Article III(1) of the BIT establishes that:

“Each Contracting Party shall afford full protection and security under international law
to investments made in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall
not hinder, by arbitrary or discriminatory measures, the management, maintenance,

development, use, enjoyment, extension, sale or, as the case may be, liquidation of such
investments.” [emphasis added]

 

608. In order for a breach of the host State’s obligation under this provision to occur, there must be one
or more measures attributable to the State that are arbitrary or discriminatory and whose effect is
to hinder — namely, preventing or obstructing — the performance of one or more of the actions set
forth in Article [1I(1) of the BIT in relation to investments protected under the Treaty.

609. Asa preliminary mater, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants’ general approach that the obligation
to ensure fair and equitable treatment of investments, enshrined in Article IV(1) of the Treaty, is
different from the obligation not to hinder, through arbitrary or discriminatory measures, the
performance of certain actions with respect to investments, as set forth in Article III(1) of the BIT.
However, Claimants have not explained how and to what extent the protection afforded by the fair
and equitable treatment clause differs from the obligation under Article III(1) of the Treaty.

610. The Tribunal notes that Claimants qualify as arbitrary and discriminatory the same facts and
conduct invoked in their allegation of unfair and inequitable treatment, applying the same standard
of “arbitrariness” and “discrimination”. In particular, Claimants contend that (i) the seizure and
special administration measures; (ii) the imposition of Decree No. 7.394; and (iii) the execution of
the Decree are arbitrary. They also claim that the imposition of the Decree — which, according to
them, covers all the assets of both Companies — is discriminatory.

611. Upon analyzing the claim for unfair and inequitable treatment, the Tribunal examined the set of
facts and circumstances related to the seizure and special administration measures and Decree No.
7.394 and concluded that Venezuela’s performance as a whole does not conform to the standard
of conduct required by Article 1V(1) of the Treaty of the Contracting States, recipients of the
investment. The Tribunal finds that some of the measures or conduct attributable to Venezuela
alleged by Claimants in the context of the claim for fair and equitable treatment are in themselves
arbitrary, namely, not supported by reason, fact or law.’4* As the Tribunal has concluded, the same
conduct by the State may constitute a breach of different obligations under the BIT. The Tribunal
shall now focus on Claimants’ allegations of conduct that they classify as arbitrary and
discriminatory, and in breach of the protection contained in Article III of the Treaty.

612. In particular, the Tribunal finds that the conduct of SIEX — which consists of not processing
requests to update the foreign investment register of Companies and Claimants — is arbitrary, as it

is ungrounded. Indeed, SIEX has refused to process these requests without even offering a
justification or explaining the reason for its conduct.

613. Venezuela suggests that SIEX’s conduct arises from the criminal process against Mr. Fernandez
Barrueco but fails to indicate its basis under the court order that ordered the measures. As noted in
paragraph 440 of this Award, it is not clear to the Tribunal, because it is not proven in the file,
what the basis for this conduct is, or whether it is related to Decree No. 7.394, as alleged by
Claimants, or whether it arises from the criminal proceeding against Mr. Fernandez Barrueco, as
Venezuela suggest.” In any event, this is conduct attributable to Venezuela that has prevented
Claimants from complying with one of the requirements under the laws of that State to transfer
monies abroad. Besides, the ambiguity regarding the origin and legal framework of this conduct is
exclusively attributable to the State, which cannot avoid its international responsibility under
confusing situations that it has created itself.

614. | The Tribunal also finds that the imposition of the Liaison Commission was arbitrary. The Parties
dispute whether the V. lan Liaison C i pied” the C ies without
complying with the requirements established in the Expropriation Law. Regardless of whether or
not there was an occupation under Venezuelan law, Respondent itself admits - and the Tribunal so
has ascertained - that the concept of a “liaison commission”, such as the one established for the
Companies after the issuance of Decree No. 7.394 and until September 2013, is not provided for
in the Decree or in the Expropriation Law. The Tribunal is also not convinced that the Liaison
Commission had been established by agreement between the Parties, inter alia, because no
instrument was provided to the arbitration to account for its creation, legal or conventional, and to
establish precisely the scope of its functions.

615. The conduct already analyzed by the Tribunal of maintaining indefinitely the stay of the
expropriation process and simultaneously applying some of the effects of Decree No. 7.394 and
the absence of a decision — more than six years later — on the admissibility or not of the remedy
with which Claimants seek to contest precautory measures that are maintained indefinitely,
although they are alleged to be temporary, are also arbitrary.

616. Finally, the Tribunal also finds that the redirection of raw materials ordered by Venezuela in 2012
was arbitrary insofar as it has no clear basis. Respondent explained in its pleadings that the power
of the State to order the redirection of products and the conditions for its exercise are provided for
in the Ley de Seguridad y Soberania Agroalimentaria of 2008.”” Specifically, it stated that “the
redirection or reassignment of products, under certain circumstances, is a clearly regulated
process in Venezuela”.”* The Tribunal does not share this conclusion.

617. In their respective expert reports, the two experts offered by Venezuela stated that the power of the
Executive to order the redirection of raw materials was considered in the Ley de Seguridad y
Soberania Agroalimentaria in force in 2012.”° However, each expert invoked different provisions
to support its conclusion. At the hearing, Dr. Velazquez accepted that he did not share Dr.
Ametrano’s analysis as to the specific legal basis of the Executive’s power to order the redirection
of raw materials and, finally, he admitted that such power was not expressly stated in the applicable
law.

618. The Tribunal considers that the statements of Respondent’s Venezuelan legal expert indicate that,
contrary to Venezuela’s assertion, the reallocation of goods is not a “clearly regulated” process

and, furthermore, raise serious doubts as to whether the Administration acted in accordance with
its powers.

619.  Inconclusion, SIEX’s conduct, the imposition of the Liaison Commission and the order to redirect
raw materials are, in themselves, arbitrary, as they lack of factual or legal basis. These actions by
the State have hindered the management and development of Claimants’ investments in Venezuela.

D. THE CLAIM FOR RESTRICTIONS ON PAYMENT TRANSFERS
1. Claimants’ Position

620. Claimants allege that Venezuela breached Article VII of the BIT, and specifically, (i) paragraph
1a), by prevention the repatriation of capital and the payment of dividends to Claimants; (ii)
paragraph 1(f), by preventing payments related to the acquisition of raw materials and other
products necessary for investment; and (iii) paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, by preventing the obtaining of
the foreign currency necessary to make the transfers referred to in the preceding subparagraphs, as
well as making these transfers without delay or restriction.’*!

621. According to Claimants, Venezuela has prohibited the repatriation of capital and the payment of
dividends in contravention of Article VII(1)(a), by prohibiting the formalization and authentication
of acts and legal affairs of Claimants, Monaca or Demaseca. Venezuela has prevented the
formalization of minutes of ings of the C ies before the Ci
Registry, including those where dividends are declared, or capital repatriations are provided to
Claimants.’*? Respondent would have prohibited Valores and Consorcio from transferring more
than USD$163.5 million in dividends for the period 2009-2014.”

622. Also, Venezuela would have breached its obligations under Article VII(1)(a) of the BIT by
preventing Monaca from paying Valores a USD$31.9 million share subscription premium for not
allowing Monaca’s registration as a foreign investment in Valores to be updated. This request from
Monaca has been pending since December 2008 (although restrictions were imposed as of
D ber 2009, V. la has ded them to previously approved and pi d pay 5).

 

623. According to Claimants, Venezuela argues that it has not breached Article VII of the BIT because
it has not expressly and directly prohibited such transfers, but has done so indirectly, through
measures that make it i ible to fc lize minutes of ings where dividends are declared
and registration as a foreign investment necessary to request foreign exchange for payment
thereof.’ This construction of Article VII of the BIT would render its content ineffective (effet
utile); Contracting States could the, under some normative pretext implicitly restrict transfers.”*°

624. Venezuela has also prevented the acquisition of foreign currency in a discriminatory manner,
contrary to Article VII(2) of the BIT. Unlike other companies in the Venezuelan food sector, it has
prohibited the formalization of minutes before the Commercial Registry and the updating of its
status as a foreign investment before SIEX. Alimentos Polar, C.A. and Cargill Venezuela, S.A.
have not been effectively prevented from transferring all of their bank accounts without
government approval, from formalizing the minutes of shareholders’ meetings that declare the
payment of dividends, and in the case of Cargill Venezuela, S.A., from registering with SIEX its

condition as a foreign investment, an essential requirement to have the possibility of acquiring the
foreign currency necessary for the repatriation of dividends or capital.’ In addition, the
Companies are not part of the assets of Mr. Fernandez Barrueco, therefore, Venezuelan restrictions
are discriminatory with respect to Claimants.’5”

625. The above restrictions are also a breach of paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article VII of the BIT, which
require that transfers be made without delay, in the convertible currency decided by the investor
and at the exchange rate on the day of the transfer, and that the procedures for making transfers of
payments related to investments are facilitated.”** Although Article VII(4) of the BIT requires that
no more than three months elapse from filing of the request to make the transfer, Monaca has
requested the purchase of foreign currency for payment to Valores of more than USD$30 million
per share subscription premium (declared in December 2008) and the request to update the
registration as a forcign investment are pending approval since April 2010.”

626. The measures have been in force since 2009, and Venezuela’s actions to maintain the status quo
indefinitely do not allow us to conclude that they are truly “temporary”.’® The transfers that
Venezuela has restricted are “payments related to [investments]” by Claimants.”*' Also, the
measures taken by the State have made it impossible for Claimants to follow the procedure for the
payment of dividends and other investment income in the convertible currency decided by them,
and in the case of the share subscription premium, Venezuela has frustrated such transfer despite
the fact that Claimants have. followed the procedures established for that purpose by the State
itself.”

2: Respondent's Position

627. Venezuela argues that it has not breached the obligation to guarantee the free transfer of funds
under Article VII of the BIT. Venezuela contends that there is no act of Venezuelan authority by
which Claimants were prohibited from transferring or making payments abroad.’

628. According to Venezuela, Claimants have not filed a claim for prima facie transfers, as they simply
repeat the facts to which they refer with respect to their claim for expropriation.” In addition, it
argues that it is the responsibility of the investor to comply with the appropriate procedure to obtain
the necessary authorization to request a transfer.’

629. There is no prohibition on the transfer of payments abroad. The measures at issue are justified by
the property preventive measures issued on November 25, 2009 under the Code of Civil Procedure
(Cédigo de Procedimiento Civil), as a result of criminal proceedings of Mr. Fernandez Barrueco.
However, the measure at issue does not consist of prohibiting the execution of corporate acts; it
only prohibits the formalization of such acts, as they are not indefinite restrictions.” In addition,
the tribunal has the power to modify or lift a measure if necessary, at the request of the interested
party.’ Therefore, there is no legal impediment for the management of the Companies to declare

or transfer dividends in accordance with Venezuelan law.

630. Claimants do not meet their burden of proof. Although shareholders meeting have been held during
2010 through 2012, Claimants have not filed any documents proving the intention of the
Companies to declare dividends in these years.” They have not submitted any evidence indicating
that the corporate acts have occurred, that the registry refused to register them under the measures
and that these acts involved a transfer abroad. Nor have they shown that they asked the judge who
ordered the measures to authorize the registration of specific acts.”

 

631. With respect to Article VII(2), Claimants confuse the concepts, since in this case there are no
regulatory measures, but the exercise of police power by means of a judicial authority. The
universe of companies to determine if there is a breach of Article VII of the BIT corresponds to
those that had a connection with Mr. Fernandez Barrucco in 2009.” Therefore, it is not appropriate
to compare the Companies with Alimentos Polar, C.A. and Cargill Venezuela, S.A.

632. Claimants allege that Venezuela has paralyzed for more than five years an application for foreign
exchange for the payment of more than USD$31 million in the form of a share subscripti
premium. However, they do not explain how this allegation is linked to the Government’s actions,
since it has nothing to do with Decree No. 7.394 or with the criminal proceedings against Mr.
Fernandez Barrueco.””! Venezuela has maintained a regime of exchange control for many years,
and this alleged application is only for one of many that Claimants have filed. and received in recent
years. Free transfer is not “unlimited” and the measures that allegedly breach this provision are
justified by the indirect and temporary measures adopted in the criminal case against Mr.
Fernandez Barrueco.

    

3. Analysis of the Tribunal

 

633. In accordance with Article VII of the BIT:

“1. Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to investors of the other Contracting Party, with respect
to investments made in its territory, the unrestricted transfer of payments relating thereto and, in
particular, but not exclusively, the following:

a) Investment income as defined in Article I: [...]

f) Sums necessary for the acquisition of raw or auxiliary materials, semi-finished or finished
products or for the replacement of capital goods or any other sum necessary for the maintenance
and development of the investment; [...]

2. The Contracting Party receiving the investment shall guarantee to the investor of the other
Contracting Party, on a non-discriminatory basis, the possibility of acquiring the currency
necessary to make the transfers covered by this article.

3. Transfers under this Agreement shall be made without delay in the convertible currency decided
by the investor and at the exchange rate applicable on the day of the transfer.

4. The Contracting Parties undertake to facilitate procedures, where necessary, to effect such
transfers without delay or restriction, in accordance with the practices of international financial

centers. In particular, no more than three months shall elapse from the date on which the investor

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 129 of 375

has duly submitted the necessary requests to effect the transfer until the time when the transfer
actually takes place”.

634. On other hand, Article I(3) of the BIT defines “investment income” as “income arisen from an
investment [...] and includes in particular, but not exclusively, profits, dividends, interest, capital
gains and royalties”.””

635. The payments covered by Article VII of the BIT include, inter alia, accrued investment income,

the compensation provided for in Article V on expropriation, and the sums necessary for the

and of the i ding those for the acq of raw or

auxiliary materials or for the substitution of capital goods. Venezuela has not denied that the sums

in respect of which Claimants allege a breach of Article VII of the BIT are payments related to
Claimants’ investments, as required by paragraph | of such article.

 

636. The Tribunal reiterates that Claimants may base claims of breaches of different BIT obligations on
the same facts. In this case, the Tribunal considers that the conduct of Venezuela in connection
with a transfer of foreign currency of the share subscription premium is a breach of Article II on
restrictions on payment transfers.

637. The share subscription premium corresponds to a return on an investment under Article 1G)of of the
- BIT and covered by transfer protection.

638. It has been proven that SIEX has not processed the applications to update the foreign investment
registry filed by Monaca and Valores between 2010 and 2013, necessary for the acquisition of
foreign currency corresponding to the transfer of USD$31.9 million share subscription premium
declared in 2008. The Venezuelan government entity responsible for assessing and authorizing
foreign exchange purchase requests under the national exchange control regime — formerly, the
Foreign Exchange Administration Commission (Comisién de Administracién de Divisas,
“CADIVI”) and since early 2014, the National Foreign Trade Center (Centro Nacional de
Comercio Exterior, “CENCOEX”) — has not liquidated the corresponding foreign exchange.

639. The Tribunal has already decided that Venezuela has acted arbitrarily with respect to the updating
of the foreign investment registry, necessary to obtain the authorization of the remittance of foreign
currency. In so doing, dent has also k hed its obli: under hs 1(1), 3 and 4
of Article VII of the BIT: (i) Venezuela has failed to comply with its obligation to guarantee
Claimants the unrestricted transfer of this payment related to their investments; (ii) it has also failed
to permit the transfer to be made without delay in the convertible currency decided by Claimants
and at the exchange rate applicable on the day of the transfers; (iii) it has failed to facilitate
procedures for effecting this transfer without delay or restrictions. Article VII(4) of the BIT further
requires that no more than three months elapse from the date on which the investor has submitted
the requires necessary to effect the transfer until such time as the transfer takes place. Respondent’s
de facto conduct has prevented Claimants from transferring the USD$31.9 million share
subscription premium, after filing the application for registration and authorization of foreign
currency acquisition before CADIVI in December 2008.”

640. On the other hand, Claimants have not proved that they have ceased to declare dividends as a result
of the conduct of Venezuela.’ Nor have they proven that SAREN’s order to the Public Registries,
Commercial Registries and Notaries Public to refrain from formalizing or authenticating the
minutes of meeting effectively prevents Claimants as shareholders of Monaca and Demaseca from

holding corporate acts, including the declaration of dividends. To the extent that such dividends
have not been declared, the Tribunal rejects Claimants’ arguments with respect to the alleged
restriction on transfers of USD$163.5 million in retained earnings for the period 2009-2014.

VI. COMPENSATION
A. CLAIMANTS’ POSITION
641. Claimants allege that because of the unlawful measures attributable to Venezuela, Claimants do

not control Monaca and Demaseca and the value of their investments in these companies has been
annihilated.’”5 Accordingly, Claimants would be entitled to reeeive: redress i in accordance with the

 

BIT and i ional law for i I acts.’ A g to Claimants, under
general international law, the principle of full reparation is on in this case, and under the
Treaty, the damage caused must be comp d by monetary Such

 

 

must then place Claimants in the same economic position that they would have been in had the
unlawful measures not been taken by Venezuela. Claimants contend that Venezuela does not
dispute that the legal standard of full reparation should govern the analysis of damages applicable
in this case.

642.  Dellepiane/Spiller explain that the set of unlawful measures imposed by Venezuela on Monaca
: and Demaseca, including Decree No. 7.394, the prohibition of transfers to its shareholders, the
appointment of special administrators with “the broadest powers of administration” has deprived
Valores and Consorcio of the economic value in those companies.’”” They conclude that under
current conditions, “companies have zero value for their shareholders’ and the damages
suffered by Claimants consist of the loss of value of the shares of Valores in Monaca ad Consorcio
in Demaseca (hereinafter, the “Investments”), since Claimants cannot derive economic benefit

from them due to the Venezuelan measures.’”

643. According to Dellepiane/Spiller, Venezuela erroneously assumes that the continued operation of
Monaca and Demaseca entails that Claimants’ shares in the Companies retain their value. On the
contrary, Claimants contend that the fact that the companies continue to operate is irrelevant and
that what is really relevant is whether Claimants can benefit from those operation. In addition, they
clarify that according to Decree No. 7.394 “expropriated goods and rights shall pass free from
encumbrance or limitations to the estate of [Venezuela]”, and the movable goods of the Companies
may not be subject to any kind of negotiation.” Therefore, the operation and profitability of the
companies no longer inure in benefit of Claimants as shareholders, but of Venezuela.

644. Claimants further argue that the measures imposed by Venezuela prevent them freely enjoying and
disposing of their it g the fund; | principle of free ownership by the
owner, and have also prevented them from receiving the fruits of their investments, since all the
profits generated by the companies and those that continue to be generated are part of the assets
affected by Decree No. 7.394. As a result, and contrary to the assertion made by the Venezuelan
experts on the appraisal of damages (“Hart/Vélez”), Dellepiane/Spiller did not assume that the
Investments have zero value, but reached this conclusion after a detailed analysis of the
Venezuelan measures.

645. In light of the foregoing, Claimants allege that they are, at a minimum entitled to receive
compensation equal to the fair market value of Monaca and Demaseca calculated as of January 21,
2013 (the Valuation Date), the day it diately prior to the publi of the Admini:
Ordinance — the measure that consummated the indirect expropriation. 781 For Claimants, “the
Administrative Ordinance was the last act of Respondent which, in conjunction with the previous
unlawful actions, resulted in the expropriation of Claimants’ Investments and which, in turn,
represented the culmination of the actions that together breached the Republic's obligations to
provide fair and equitable treatment, and not to hinder the management, use and enjoyment and
sale of Claimants’ investments”.”®

646.  Dellepiane/Spiller calculated the fair value of the Investments at the Valuation Date, without taking
into account the effects of previous unlawful measures attributable to Venezuela. They concluded
that under the principle of full reparation and in order to place Claimants in a position equivalent
to that which they would have had if Venezuela had not imposed the measures, the fair market
value of the Investments as of the Valuation Date amounts to USD$622.7 million and that the total
damages suffered by Claimants as of the same date were USD$629.7 million, excluding interest.

647. According to Claimants, the fair market value of the Investments calculated by Dellepiane/Spiller
coincides with: (i) the value recognized in 2010 as “base trading price” guaranteed by Venezuela
as a result of an appraisal made by independent experts appointed by Claimants and Venezuela,
where it was determined that the fair market value of the Companies’ share capital ranged from
USD$583.6 million to USD USD$659.1 million; and (ii) the value as “estimated price” for the
acquisition of Monaca and Demaseca in December 2011 recommended by the Ministry of Food to
the President of the Republic, which is equivalent to at least USD$574 million for the total stock
of Monaca and Demaseca.”®

648. Claimants also request: (i) that the compensation ordered by the Tribunal is not subject to the taxes
that Dellepiane/Spiller have already taken into account upon calculating the amount of
compensation, otherwise taxes would be deducted in favor of Venezuela two times;”* (ii) that the
amount of compensation be updated, using a compound interest rate, from the Valuation Date to
the effective date of payment;”* and (iii) that all costs and expenses of this arbitration are borne
by Respondent, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of legal
representation.”

649. According to Claimants, the BIT does not determine the standard of compensation applicable in
circumstances such as these, and should therefore be governed by general principles of
international law. The standard for calculating damages for internationally wrongful acts is that of
“full reparation”. According to the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Chorzéw
Factory case, “reparation must, as far as possible, eliminate all consequences of the unlawful act
and reestablish the situation that, in all probability, would have existed had the act not been
committed”.’*’ Under international law, reparation should as far as possible, consist of restitution
in kind, but where such restitution is impossible or inapplicable — such as in this case — it should
consist of monetary compensation that places the victim of the wrongful act in the same economic
position as it would have been had the wrongful act not occurred. Claimants note that various
international tribunals that various international tribunals have repeatedly recognized that fair

market value is the standard generally used for the valuation of assets such as going concern. Since
the unlawful measure destroyed the value of the Investments, excluding the impact of the unlawful
measures, shall put Claimants in the “situation that, in all likelihood, would have existed had the
unlawful acts not been committed.”*

Claimants argue that this Valuation standard, frequently applied in expropriation cases, is also

d to measure damages caused by V that breach the standard of fair and
equitable treatment and other guarantees over the use and enjoyment of Treaty investments.’”
Claimants contend that if the Tribunal finds that Venezuela has not breached Article V of the BIT,
the would be willing to transfer their shares in Monaca and Demaseca to Venezuela once
Venezuela pays, in convertible currency and into an account to be designated by Spain, a
compensation equivalent to the fair market value of Monaca and Demaseca.””

 

In addition, according to Claimants, the standard of compensation provided for in Article V(2) of
the BIT for the case of lawful expropriations functions as a floor or minimum of the amount owed
on expropriations.””!

Dellepiane/Spiller concluded that the Investments lack value due to Respondents actions because
“Venezuela has limited in their entirety the usufruct that Claimants (or, instead, a hypothetical
purchaser) could receive from the profit-making capacity of Monaca and Demaseca, and thus,
their economic value”. According to Dellepiane/Spiller, the only source of value that Monaca
and Demaseca could have for their shareholders, or a potential buyer, is exclusively the possible
compensation that Venezuela decides to grant for the assets subject to expropriation. They allege
that it is a fallacy of Venezuela that Claimants have been unable to dispose of their own investments
through their own fault.’° Claimants add that the profits generated by Monaca and Demaseca have
not been used in the normal course of business, as argued by Hart/Vélez. This use was sub-optimal,
and responded to the impossibility of distributing dividends, forcing Monaca and Demaseca to
accumulate inventories, invest in capital goods and cancel debts in order to reduce losses arisen
from inflation and devaluation of the bolivar.”*

Dellepiane/Spiller used two methodologies to calculate the fair market value of the Investments at
the Valuation Date: (i) discounted cash flow (“DCF”), as the primary methodology; and (ii) relative
valuation, as the secondary method to corroborate the reasonableness of the results obtained from
the primary methodology. They explain that the DCF method is appropriate because Monaca and
Demaseca are two companies with a long and profitable trajectory in the Venezuelan market.
Dellepiane/Spiller concluded that the damages suffered by Claimants as a result of the
expropriation and hindrance of the management of their investments amounts to USD$579.5
million, corresponding to the fair market value of the shares of Monaca and Demaseca, as of
January 21, 2012. Damages related to the effect of the “redirecting” of white corn on corn flour
sales in 2012 have the effect of increasing the fair market value of the shares of Monaca and
Demaseca at the Valuation Date by USD$43.2 million, for a total of USD$622.7 million.’>

In addition, the “redirecting” of white corn caused damaged during 2012 of USD$7 million,
corresponding to the decrease in the sales volume of corn flour from Monaca and Demaseca in
2012 resulting from Venezuela’s order to redirect more than 86.4 thousand metric tons of white

656. Claimants explain that in this case Monaca and Demaseca were valued on a consolidated basis (as
a business unit) taking into account that their management and operation is carried out jointly, at
least one of them operates in both the corn and wheat segments and both executed a preliminary
merger agreement in 2006 that was in the process of execution when Venezuela began to impose
the unlawful measures.”

657.  Dellepiane/Spiller projected the cash flows for 10 years, from January 2013 to December 2012,
and for the subsequent period applied a terminal value of the companies. Within the DCF method,
the main determinants of the value of Monaca and Demaseca were also applied: sales volumes,
selling prices of products, operating costs, capital investments, taxes and discount rate. Claimants
argue that Respondent's objections to Dellepiane/Spiller’s estimated cash flow projections for
Monaca and Demaseca are invalid and in no way call into question Dellepiane/Spiller’s analysis
of the value of the Investments.””*

658. To discount the future cash flows of Monaca and Demaseca, Dellepiane/Spiller used the weighted
average cost of capital (*“WACC”) and concluded that the appropriate WACC is 10.12% as of the
Valuation Date. Within WACC’s cost of equity component, Dellepiane/Spiller used as a measure

of country risk the average yield (above the risk-free rate) of bonds from countries with similar
credit rating to Venezuela, estimated by Professor Damodaran in 400 basis points (4.0%).”°
Claimants contend that Hart/Vélez substantially inflate Monaca’s and Demaseca’s by taking into
account a country risk premium of 10.87%, and including the risk of expropriation without
compensation, contrary to the principle of integral reparation.* In addition, Hart/Vélez unduly
apply a size premium of 2.69% (which is inapplicable, according to Dellepiane/Spiller).®"

Dellepiane/Spiller also used the relative valuation method to corroborate whether the conclusions
of the DCF method were reasonable. Applying the relative valuation method, they conclude that
the share value of Monaca and Demaseca under this methodology was between USD$540.8 and
USD$599.4 million, confirming the reasonableness of the fair market value of the Investments
obtained through the discounted cash flow analysis performed by Dellepiane/Spiller at USD$579.5
million.2?

Claimants also contend that the valuations recognized by Respondent in 2010 and 2011 confirm
the reasonableness of the Dellepiane/Spiller valuation.*® After Decree No. 7.394 was published,
the Parties agreed to conduct an appraisal of Monaca and Demaseca through a commission
consisting of two experts, each appointed by a party. This Appraisal Commission fixed the value
of the companies as of July 31, 2010 at the equivalent of USD$659.1 million at the exchange rate
then applicable. Then, Venezuela would have demanded to adjust the previous figure to reduce it,
which Claimants pted. This September 2010 i ituted the base iation price
agreed by the Parties as a result of the joint valuation and reached USD$583.6 million, also at the
exchange rate applicable at that time. Finally, in December 2011, the Minister of Food had
informed President Hugo Chavez that no more than USD$520 million should be paid for 80% of
Monaca and Demaseca. This entails a value of at least USD$574 million for all Monaca and
Demaseca when deducting the royalty debt and financial debt as of December 31, 2011.8

Claimants allege that Venezuela’s and Hart/Vélez’s criticisms to Dellepiane/Spiller’s valuation
and their alternative fair market value calculations are ungrounded. Dellepiane/Spiller used
conservative projections and appropriate variables in the DCF model and corroborated the
reasonableness of their projections with an analysis of comparable companies and with the
valuations endorsed by Venezuela in 2010 and 2011.85 They maintain that the “historical
transactions” referred to by Hart/Vélez are not indicative of the fair market value of the
Investments as of the Valuation Date.*°

As to the interest on the compensation due, Claimants argue that since the Treaty does not contain
an express provision on the payment of interest, general principles of international law should
govern. Therefore, in accordance with the principle of full reparation, Claimants should be
compensated by paying pre-award and post-award interest for the loss of opportunity cost that the
compensation due would have generated.

Such interest must also be calculated in compound form.®” Thus, in order to place Claimants in
the same position as they would have been if Respondent had not taken the actions discussed and
to prevent Respondent from enriching itself by unlawfully withholding compensation due to

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 135 of 375

Claimants, the Tribunal should (i) update the amount of compensation through the compound
interest method until the date of the Award, and (ii) also order the payment of compound interest
post-Award on the amount of compensation determined therein.**

663. — Following Claimants’ instructions, Dellepiane/Spiller updated the damages using two alternative
interest rates: (i) the equivalent to Libor plus a margin of 4% for a pre-award interest rate of 4.48%,
and (ii) the capital cost of the grain milling and food processing industry in the United States,
which they estimate at 6.29%.*” Applying these rates, Dellepiane/Spiller calculate that the
damages suffered by Claimants excluding white corn redirection damages are between USD$644.8
million and USD$672.3 million as of June 29, 2015, while the damages caused by such redirection
represent between USD$53.6 million and USD$55 million.8!

664. Claimants allege that the short-term or risk-free interest rate proposed by Venezuela is
unreasonable and would encourage its unlawful conduct, since the interest rates that Venezuela
must offer to cover its capital needs are much higher than the risk-free rates it proposes.*!! In
addition, Claimants criticize Venezuela's assertion that the award of compound interest only
applies in special circumstances, because it ignores the recent and prevailing practice of investment
tribunals.‘

665. Claimants also assert that, contrary to Venezuela’s allegations, it is common practice to award
post-award interest, such as in investment arbitrations in which Venezuela has been convicted in
the past seven years. A contrary solution would encourage nonpayment of the award in a timely
manner and Venezuela’s attitude indicates that it shall not recognized the lawfulness of any
possible award.$!*

666. Finally, Claimants allege that the principle of full reparation requires that Venezuela does not tax
the compensation ordered in this proceeding with taxes that have already been taken into account
by Dellepi Spiller i in the termination of such F ion. In particular, such taxes are: (i)
income tax, (ii) science, technology and innovation tax, (iii) the tax of the Organic Law of Drugs
(Ley Organica de Drogas), and (iv) sports, physical activity and physical education tax. Had these
taxes not been applied in their calculations, the fair market value determined by Dellepiane/Spiller
would be considerably higher.*!*

667. Thus, any attempt by Respondent to tax the same income at a higher rate or twice would constitute
an additional breach of the Treaty and would be inconsistent with the Tribunal’s award. According
to Claimants, this has been recognized by various tribunal upon recognizing that the value of the
expropriated asset should not be influenced by the expropriation itself.$!°

B. RESPONDENT'S POSITION

668. Venezuela rejects the Claimants’ right to receive the compensation they seek because they have
not proven that the value of Monaca and Demaseca has been annihilated as a result of losing control
of their investments, or because Venezuela has prevented them from enjoying the economic
benefits of their investments.‘!° Even if some of Claimants’ alleged breaches other than the

expropriation have occurred, their claim that they should be compensated for the full value of the
Investments should not be accepted. These objected measures would be of a temporary and limited
nature, so that the alleged damage would never be the total loss of the Investments.®!”

In its Counter Memorial, Venezuela clarifies that in accordance with the principle of integral
reparation, the State is bound to repair only for the damage caused by the unlawful conduct.
Venezuela adds that Claimants are wrong to assume that full reparation in this case consists of
restitution of the total value of the business, as if it had been divested, when Gruma retains
ownership and control of Monaca and Demaseca.!8

Now, in its Rejoinder, Venezuela argues that if the Tribunal concludes that there was a legal,
indirect or illegal expropriation, the principle of integral reparation under customary international
law does not apply in this case.*'° Respondent submits that the applicable standard would be the
“actual value of the investment” immediately prior to the expropriation date — which according to
Claimants was January 21, 2013 — as set forth in Article V of the Treaty, as /ex specialis.**
According to Hart/Vélez, the real value of the companies at that date would in no case be more
than USD$266.7 million, as proven by the ADM Transaction. Claimants’ assertion that the Treaty
only establishes the standard of compensation applicable to lawful expropriation is incorrect.

According to Venezuela, Claimants’ theory of damages rests on the premise that the value of their
Investments was annihilated as a result of Venezuela’s alleged expropriatory and discriminatory
measures. Dellepiane/Spiller simply assumed that the value of Monaca and Demaseca was zero at
the Valuation Date, without first determining the actual impact that Venezuela’s allegedly
discriminatory and expropriatory measures had on the Companies.*” In other words, they assume
that the value of the companies is zero, falsely alleging that Venezuela stripped them of the control
and economic benefits of their Investments. Venezuela argues that this is a financial fiction because
Monaca and Demaseca continue to operate and are even performing better after Venezuela’s
alleged behaviors.*” It adds that in the 2012 Gruma Annual Report, it expressly recognized that
there was no indication of impairment of the value of Gruma’s net investment in Monaca and
Demaseca.* In addition, Venezuela argues that Claimants must prove: (i) that had it not been for
the allegedly wrongful act, the harm would have occurred (factual element of causation); and (ii)
that such wrongful act was the proximate and direct cause of the harm (legal element of
causation).°5

Venezuela maintains that it is not true that the value of Monaca and Demaseca is zero, because
neither the seizure nor Decree No. 7.394 prevent Valores and Consorcio from enjoying the
economic benefit of their Investments. Claimants have not proved that these measures prevent
them from declaring and distributing dividends, or that they have caused the loss of control over
their Investments. Contrary to Claimants’ allegations, Venezuela has proven that the measures
currently affecting Monaca and Demaseca are temporary, and therefore reversible, linked to a
criminal proceeding whose sole purpose is the preservation and custody of property or assets linked
to Mr. Fernandez Barrueco should his liability be established as a result of such proceeding.®”
Claimants retain control and title over Monaca and Demaseca, and the expropriation proceedings

are suspended. The Venezuelan set of measures did not replace the statutory administrators or

prevent them from exercising their functions in the management and conduct of the business.*”
673. la adds that Claimants themselves do not dare to state categorically that there is a
jon on distributing dividends. Although it is true that the seizure prohibit, through the
SAREN, the recording of minutes, nothing prevents the shareholders of the Board of Directors of
the Companies from making decisions, including the decision to declare dividends, and put those
decisions on the record.*’* Venezuela explains that the act of declaring dividends is a constitutive
act of rights and that once declared by the corresponding corporate body, shareholders acquire an
irrevocable right of credit. Therefore, it is not necessary to register the minute where they are
declared, in order for this right to be enforceable.‘ In any event, once the dividends had been
declared, Claimants could have resorted to the judge to authorize the formalization of the
minutes.**! The profits of a company, once declared as dividends, become a debt to be paid to the
shareholders and, therefore, would not be “productive assets” affected by Decree No. 7.394.8*
Even if it were true that they could not distribute dividends, Claimants have not suffered damages
because historically they have not distributed dividends.’* Finally, Hart/Vélez note that no damage
has been caused by the fact that Monaca and Demaseca have withheld potential dividends, since
they were used in the normal course of business.**

   

 

674. Venezuela also argues that the redirection measures are normal in the food industry, have been
requested on other occasions by Monaca.and entail a normal contractual relationship with other
industry subjects. In addition, it adds that there is no evidence that the Venezuelan measures
prevented Claimants from selling their shares in Monaca and Demaseca, and that the link between
Gruma and Claimants with Mr. Fernandez Barrueco and between Monaca and ADM Latin
America (“ADM Latam”) could in itself have influenced the alleged impossibility of transferring
the shares of the Companies.**°

 

 

675. On the other hand, Venezuela alleges that if Claimants succeed in showing that they suffered
damages as a result of Venezuela’s unlawful conduct, the circumstances of this case do not deserve
an assessment of the fair market value of the business because Gruma was not stripped of its
companies.**’ At most, and only for purposes of argumentation, it could be considered as a
temporary interference in business. Venezuela explains that Dellepiane/Spiller should not have
made an assessment of the total value of the business,’ but a comparison between an DCF
valuation in the scenario of non-existence of the alleged measures (“counterfactual scenario”)
and an DCF valuation that considers such measures (“real scenario”). In cases like this one
where Claimants have an indirect investment — through other companies of which they are

shareholders — tribunals have considered that compensation should be measured in relation to the
specific impact on the State’s conduct on the financial situation of claimants as shareholders.*°
For the event that the Tribunal finds a non-expropriatory breach of the Treaty, the standard of
compensation is the actual loss caused to the financial position of Valores and Consorcio as
shareholders of Monaca and Demaseca.*! However, this compensable damage to a shareholder
could include, for example, the loss of the value of the shares, but is it not equivalent to the losses
suffered by the affiliate through which the investment was made.*4?

676. Also, Venezuela opposes a valuation by a method that presumes a total loss of business. Fair
market value, based on the quantification of the total value of the business, is more appropriate for
cases of total loss or destruction of the investment. Venezuela argues that when there is temporary
interference it is neither practical nor correct to focus on the value of the entire investment, as
compensation should only cover the period of interruption. In the event that the measures are
reversed, and Claimants succeed in obtaining the compensation they claim, they would receive
double compensation: the amount claimed plus the profits of the two companies that would
continue to operate under the same conditions prior to the measures. Although “Claimants argue
that the claimed damages consist of the loss of value of their investments due to the Venezuelan
measures”,* they expressly exclude from valuation the eventual effect of such measures and
assume a loss of value of their shares.**

- 677. A ing to V the ADM Ti i firms that Monaca and Demaseca had value
even after the seizure and Decree No. 7.394*° were decreed. In December 2012, Gruma decides
to exercise its preemptive right and matched a third party offer to purchase all ADM’s shares in
Valores and Consorcio for USD$8 million. The sole assets representing Valores and Consorcio are
their holdings in Monaca and Demaseca.*” From that transaction, with respect to 3% of ADM’s
shares in Valores and Consorcio, the Venezuelan experts infer that the total value of Monaca and
Demaseca is USD192.6 million after deducing the USD$74.1 million of royalty debts.“* An
appropriate indication of a company’s value is given by its historical transactions, such as the ADM
Transaction, just one month prior to the Valuation Date chosen by Claimants. Hart/Vélez explained
from their first report that the ADM Transaction gives a good indication of the value of the
Investments in the current scenario, which serves as the basis for a comparison with the
counterfactual scenario to the extent that the Tribunal determines that such comparison is
necessary.*”

 

678. Venezuela also alleges that Dellepiane/Spiller poorly applies DCF’s methodology and the method
of comparable publicly traded companies, artificially inflating Claimants’ alleged damages.
Dellepiane/Spiller barely apply, conveniently, the results and financial data of a single fiscal
year.® Respondent suggests that Dellepiane/Spiller avoid presenting the historical analysis of
Monaca’s and Demaseca’s transactions because it would show that their results are better now than
before the measures that allegedly caused them harm.**! In addition, Dellepiane/Spiller make
speculative assumptions that reduce risk, result in an inflated valuation and set aside the effect of

its own administrative actions that would affect the value in a possible sale to a third party.

Respondent also rejects Claimants’ argument that their sales were adversely affected by the
redirection of corn, which further allegedly would justify additional damage of USD$43.5 million
according to Dellepiane/Spiller.*>* Venezuela explains that Dellepiane/Spiller calculate the cost of
Monaca’s and Demaseca’s debt simply by adding the U.S., risk-free rate to their country risk and
their industry risk premi btaining 7.3%. If, as d by Dellepiane/Spiller, a WACC of
10.12% is used for an investment in Monaca and Demaseca, the country risk premium would have

to be assumed as negative.**? Even assuming, not consented to by Venezuela, that Claimants’

method was accepted as appropriate, the correct WACC as of January 21, 2013 is really 19.16%.5%

Using the corrected WACC and considering adequately the production and prices of wheat flour,
the value of Monaca and Demaseca would be reduced from USD$462.1 million to USD$222.1

million.

 

According to Respondent, in applying the comparable, publicly traded method, Dellepiane/Spiller
conveniently use non-comparable examples,®* and artificially inflate their value by applying a
27% control premium.** They forget to standardize the financial statements of comparable
companies and the companies under evaluation in order to put them in a comparable situation from
an accounting point of view.®*”

In addition, Venezuela asserts that Claimants leave without floor their arguments on the referential
effects of the 2010 and 2011 valuations when Dellepiane/Spiller indicate in their first report that
the eliminated the carrying value methodology because it did not represent the company’s ability
to generate future cash flows.** This also applies to benchmark assets valuations, as they do not
measure the capacity to generate these cash flows.

Venezuela concludes that Claimants have not complied with their obligation to calculate the
alleged damages — which is their procedural burden, therefore, their claim for damages must be
rejected in its entirety.

In addition, Venezuela argues that Claimants’ request for the payment of pre- and post-award
compound interest has no basis in the Treaty, is contrary to the principles of international law and
fails to stand up to international jurisprud on ar 859 The joint appli

of the two proposed interest rates by Claimants is incorrect and excessive, since international
tribunals have applied interest rates based on short-term U.S. Treasury bonds or similar risk-free
rates, rather than speculating on what Claimants hypothetically might have generated.
Accordingly, in failing to determine an applicable interest rate in the Treaty, Hart/Vélez apply a
10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate or a six-month Libor rate plus 2%, alleging that the rates requested
by Claimants are higher than the rates historically awarded 2°

Venezuela also alleges that, contrary to Claimants’ assertions, neither international law nor
tribunals, in general, award reparations on a compound interest basis. On the contrary, under
international law, compound interest is appropriate only when justified by special circumstances.
Claimants have not presented any special circumstances that would justify deviating from the

general rule of international law on the application of simple interest and, accordingly, their request
to apply a compound interest should be rejected.**!

685. Similarly, since there is no basis for assuming that Venezuela shall not pay any eventual
compensation ordered in the award, the request for post-ward interest is inappropriate and should
be rejected.® Without demonstration of or history of a non-compliance, requiring post-decision
interest is speculative.®

686. —_ Finally, Venezuela contends that Claimants cannot request that any compensation ordered by the
Tribunal in this arbitration not be taxed. The application of taxes is an instrument of state policy
that is beyond the control of the Parties and, consequently, the general rule under international law
is that the tax considerations are a natural consequence of any award of damages.®* Furthermore,
Claimants’ request with respect to taxes is premature and speculative, since it has even been
explained which taxes they would apply and, accordingly, the alleged actual tax risk is not

articulated.*

687. Claimants find no basis in international law to justify their claim. On the contrary, tribunals have
considered that full compensation does not mean that the investor is covered by a situation of tax
deduction. Claimants limit themselves simply to an accounting argument, but there is no
determination of tax risk they allegedly face, so the claim is purely speculative a and impossible to
determine.®”

Cc ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBUNAL

688. The Tribunal begins by noting that it shall apply the Tales of the Treaty itself and public

international law to d the ion owed by Vi for the t of the BIT
identified in this Award.

689. The Tribunal recalls that it has not found that in this case the measures taken by Venezuela
constitute and expropriation.**

690. Article X1(5) of the BIT states that:

“The arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach by
the Contracting Party of its obligations under this Agreement, whether such breach
of obligations has caused damage to the investor of the other Contracting Party
and, if so, to fixing the amount of compensation”.

691. Unlike Article V(2) of the BIT, the Treaty does not detail a standard of compensation or a specific
methodology of compensation applicable as a result of breaches other than expropriation.
However, Article X1(5) of the Treaty clearly and expressly recognizes the Tribunal’s power to “fix
the amount of compensation” linked to a contracting party’s failure to comply with the BIT 2°

692. Claimants argue that they are “entitled to redress in accordance with the standards set out in the
Agreement and general international law for internationally wrongful acts”. The Tribunal
agrees that the principle of integral paration under y i law applies to

for Vi 's breaches of the dards of fair and equitat of
hindrance measures and of the obligation with respect to BIT.'”! As established by the Permanent
Court of International Justice in the Chorzéw Factory case:

“The repair must be, as far as possible, eliminate all the consequences of the illegal act and
reestablish the situation that, in all probability, would have existed had the act not been
committed”.*”?

693. Similarly, the United Nations International Law Commission provided in Article 31 of the Articles
on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts for the codification of the principle of
full reparation.’”? As developed by the tribunal in Gold Reserve v. Venezuela, the principle of
integral reparation applies to breaches of obligations contained in investment treaties:

“Returning now to the relevant principles of international law applicable to the award of
damages for breach of TJE, the Tribunal begins with an analysis of the principles of the
Chorz6w Factory. It is true that this was a State-to-state liability case and, as Respondent
has rightly pointed out it cannot automatically apply to an investor-state situation. -
However, it is well accepted in international investment law that the principles adopted in
the Chorzéw Factory, although initially established in a state-to-state context, are the
relevant principles of international law that apply when considering compensation for
breach of a [bilateral investment treaty]. It is these well-established principles that
represent customary international law, even for breach of international obligations under
[bilateral investment treaties], which the Tribunal is bound to apply. Even a cursory
analysis of previous ICSID cases considering this issue confirms it. As /mpregilo v.
Argentina states: ‘With regard to compensation, the basic principle to be applied is that
laid down by the Permanent Court of International Justice in its ruling in the Chorzow
Factory case. According to that principle, reparation should remedy the consequences of
the wrongful act to the greatest extent possible and restore the circumstances to the
situation that would have probably occurred had it not been committed. In other words, in
principle, Jmpregilo should be placed in the same situation as it would be if Argentina had
not treated its investment unfairly and inequitably’. [These] principles supplement those
contained in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, specifically Article 31, to make full
reparation for damage caused by the breach of an international obligation. This, in turn,
reflects customary international law”.®74

694. The Tribunal shall, therefore, proceed to fix the amount of compensation to be paid by Venezuela
to the Claimants as a consequence of Treaty breaches found by the Tribunal, applying the principle
of full reparation.

87! To the extent that the Tribunal did not find in this case that Venezuelan measures constituted an expropriation, it shall not

695. The Tribunal considers that the burden of proving the existence of loss or damage suffered by
Claimants lies with them. With respect to the causal link specifically, there must be a “sufficient
causal link” between the wrongful act and the loss suffered by claimant to order the corresponding
compensation.*> The Tribunal has broad discretion to determine the evidentiary value of the
evidence submitted by the Parties®”* in relation to the existence of injury, the determination of
causality between the wrongful conduct and the injury suffered, and the applicable methodology
for ordering compensation.2”

696. However, it is widely recognized that, depending on the circumstances of the specific case,
tribunals may choose to apply certain valuation methods, as well as to adapt them after assessing
different arguments or opinions of the Parties and the facts proven by them. It could hardly be
considered that the amount of compensation corresponding to the breach of an obligation in an
investment treaty can be determined with scientific certainty or absolute accuracy,*” even if there
is certainty that the investor has suffered some harm. The process for ordering the payment of
damages may entail the use of certain reasonable approximations,*” considering further that the
Tribunal shall seek “as far as possible, to eliminate all consequences of the unlawful act and to
reestablish the situation that would, in all probability, have existed, had the act not been
committed”.*® Nothing in the foregoing exempts the Tribunal from awarding damages for the
damages suffered and proven by Claimants.**' In the terms presented by the tribunal in System v.
Kyrgyzstan:

“The Tribunal is also aware of the fact that all valuations in the absence of an
actual sale are estimates and it is aware that the Tribunal has a legal duty to render
an award under a process that Respondent has freely agreed to establish, and that
Claimant has freely chosen to pursue, and on the basis of the material that the
parties have decided to submit to it. This is, necessarily, an exercise in the art of
the possible; and the Tribunal has sought to arrive at a rational and fair estimate,
in accordance with the [bilateral investment treaty], of the loss suffered by
Claimant, rather than seeking the chimera of a sum that is uniquely and
indisputably the correct determination of the value lost by Claimant. The Tribunal
is comforted by Immanuel Kant’s remark that ‘From a wood as twisted as that of
which man is made nothing entirely straight can be carved’”.8

697. —_ Inthis case, the experts of both Parties agree that the methodology to be used to calculate damages
to Claimants would be the difference in the value of the share capital of Monaca and Demaseca
under a real scenario, which includes the effect of the Treaty breaching measures and a
counterfactual scenario, which reflect the value of Claimants’ investments without such
measures.**

the main difference between the Parties is that, for Dellepiane/Spiller, the value of the Investments in the real scenario equals
zero. However, the methodology proposed by Dellepiane/Spiller entails a comparison between the value of the Investments in the
counterfactual scenario and in that hypothetical real scenario where the value of the Investments would have been annihilated
(zero value). This comparison necessarily leads us consider that the total value of the Investments in the counterfactual scenario,
measured by Claimants and Dellepiane/Spiller with the DCF method, is equal to the value to be indemnified. Venezuela, for its
part, alleges that the value of the Investments in the real scenario is not equivalent to zero. The difference then does not lie in the

698. — Hart/Vélez argue that:

“the appropriate method for determining loss of profit would be to calculate the
companies’ FMV as if the alleged measures had not occurred and then compare the result
with the companies’ fair market value based on the alleged measures. The difference

between the two values would reflect the loss of profit, namely, the damages”.5*4

699. For their part, Dellepiane/Spiller state in their Second Report that:

“Hart/Vélez agree with the methodology we used for the aggregate damages
caused to Claimants, in the sense that they should be calculated as the difference
in the share value of Monaca and Demaseca under two scenarios: a) A real
scenario, which includes the effect of the expropriation and hindrance measures
on management adopted by Venezuela. B) A counterfactual scenario, which
reflects the value of Claimants’ investments without such measures. Contrary to
the statements of Hart/Vélez this is precisely the approach to calculating damages
in our First Report [...]”.°%

700. The Tribunal considers that this is an appropriate valuation method to be applied in this case,
insofar as it would eliminate the consequences of Venezuela’s breaches of the BIT and restore. the
situation that would have existed had such breaches not been committed.

701. | However, Claimants’ and Venezuela’s experts disagree on both the value of the Investments under
the real scenario and under the counterfactual scenario. The Tribunal shall determine first the
value of the Investments in the real scenario and, second, their value in the counterfactual
scenario.

1. Value of the Investments in the real scenario

702.  Dellepiane/Spiller estimate that in the real scenario the value of Monaca and Demaseca to their
shareholders, or instead, to a potential buyer, is zero. According to Claimants Dellepiane/Spiller
concluded that the Investments have zero value in the real scenario based on Claimants’
instructions®® and after analyzing in detail the effect of the measures imposed by Venezuela, based
on economic, financial and valuation principles. To the extent that for Claimants the value of the
Investments in the real scenario is zero, the compensation due would be the total of the
Investments in the counterfactual scenario. This is equivalent to the fair market value of the
Investments.

703. Claimants further assert that this methodology is adequate to quantify damages suffered as a result
of measures that breach the standard of fair and equitable treatment and guarantees on the use and
enjoyment of investments, which “preclude any significant return on the investment” **’
Claimants refer to the case of CMS v. Argentina, where the tribunal found that Argentina had
breached the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment and fixed the amount of damages
suffered based on the fair market value of the investment.**

methodology to be used (this, for the Tribunal, is more of a difference in language), but in what cach Party considers to be the
value of the Investments in the real scenario in the counterfactual scenario.

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 144 of 375

Claimants and Dellepiane/Spiller explain that their estimate of damages would be the same
regardless of the legal framework within which Claimants’ claim fits, whether in breach of fair and
equitable treatment or expropriation as follows:

(i) Although Monaca and Demaseca generate positive cash flows, their
shares are of no value as a result of the measures imposed by Venezuela,
which have fully limited the use, enjoyment and disposition that Claimants
(or a potential purchaser) could earn from the profit-generating capacity
of Monaca and Demaseca.

(ii) Inaddition, due to Decree No. 7.394, shareholders may not dispose of their
shares in an amount that reflects anything other than the expected value of
the compensation that Venezuela shall give for expropriated assets. “Even
in the absence of any impossibility or any restriction on the distribution of
dividends, Claimants (or a potential purchaser) are certain, as of May 12,
2010, that at any time such ability to receive the flow of future dividends
shall be formally transferred to Venezuela™.**’ Therefore, the value of
Monaea’s and Demaseca’s shareholding for Claimants or a potential
purchaser is determined solely by the expectation of the potential
compensation that Venezuela may decide to grant for the assets subject to
Decree No. 7.394. The value of such compensation does not represent the
fair market value of the Investments, nor does it represent their ability to
generate profits.‘”°

 

 

(iii) Accordingly, the estimate of damages caused to Claimants as a result of
the measures would be the same regardless of whether the claim is in
breach of fair and equitable treatment or expropriation.

(iv) Dellepiane/Spiller propose a hypothetical case in which Claimants attempt
to resort to a financial institution to borrow money by pledging the shares
of Monaca or Demaseca as security, They contend that no financial
institution would accept them as collateral, since “wnder the measures
imposed by Respondent no longer matters the capacity of the companies
themselves to generate funds, but rather the inability of shareholders to
access those funds”.®"

For its part, Venezuela argues that Dellepiane/Spiller should have determined the real impact that
the measures alleged to be contrary to the BIT had on the Investments. Hart/Vélez contend that
Dellepiane/Spiller incurred in a “financial fiction” by assuming that the value of the Investments
in the real scenario is zero, based on false assumptions about the divestment of the control and
economic benefits of Claimants’ Investments.’ Hart/Vélez consider that the best indication of the
value of Monaca and Demaseca in the current scenario at the Valuation Date (selected by
Claimants) is the ADM Transaction. They contend that the implied value of the Companies on the
on the basis of this transaction is USD$266.7 million, “which results in a total value of Claimants’
investment of [USD]$192.6 million when [USD]S874.1 million is subtracted from the royalty
debt”.

706. In addition, Hart/Vélez explain that Claimants’ argument that the ADM Transaction only
represents what was expected to be received from Venezuela in the expropriation process
meaningless, since “if there was protection under the investment treaty, the transaction would not
have occurred at a value below the [fair market value] guaranteed by the [BIT]”.2

707. According to Venezuela, if the Tribunal finds a breach of Treaty protections other than
expropriation, it would also be necessary to determine whether, and to what extent, the breach
caused harm to the Claimants. Applying this criterion of compensation when the investor invests
in shares in a company — as in the case of Claimants — tribunals have considered that compensation
should be measured in relation to the specific impact of the State’s conduct on the financial
situation of Claimants as shareholders.

708. In this case, the Tribunal has decided that the measures taken by Venezuela have not constituted
an expropriation. The facts described by Claimants in their letter of instructions to
Dellepiane/Spiller also do not amount to a loss of control of the investment or a loss of its value.
Although Claimants allege that the profits generated by Monaca and Demaseca were not used in
the ordinary course of business, the Tribunal considers it important to mention that there is no

id in this arbitration from the bodies or shareholders of the C ies of a
profit management or dividend distribution policy, or where the alleged sub-optimal use of profits
has been discussed or decided upon.

709. In conclusion, the Tribunal does not consider the premises on which Claimants and
Dellepiane/Spiller base their conclusion that the value of Claimants’ Investments has been
annihilated to be proven.

710. Now, the Tribunal has found that Venezuela has breached Articles III, IV and VII of the BIT.
Among others, Respondent has hindered the transfer of dividends abroad in breach of the Treaty
through the conduct of SIEX. Venezuela has imposed a series of obstacles to the disposition of
assets covered by Decree No. 7.394 and to the management of the Companies based on an
expropriation process based on an expropriation process that has been suspended for almost ten
years, and a negotiation process that has not been advanced by Respondent’s decision, while
Venezuelan officials continue to apply measures based on the Decree. Actions by Venezuelan
officials have generated confusion between those measures taken under the criminal process
involving Mr. Fernandez Barrueco and those arisen from the Venezuelan food Decree and policies.
The foregoing, among other measures, coupled with the excessive delay (more than six years) in
the decision to admit the appeal of the third party proceeding (incidente de tercerias) and the
decision to dismiss in the criminal case against Mr. Fernandez Barrueco have prevented Claimants
from challenging the measures imposed by Venezuela to fully resume the normal operation of
Monaca and Demaseca.

 

711. Although the Tribunal has determined that such conduct does not amount to a total or substantial
loss of control or value of the it as ly and ly hindered the
exercise of Claimants’ rights as shareholders of Monaca and Demaseca and subjected the future
exercise of these rights to a situation of uncertainty. The fact that the Companies continue to
operate, and that their sales have behaved satisfactorily during the years in which Respondent

their business” [emphasis added]; “the disposition of assets of these companies is prohibited”; and “it is impossible for MONACA
and DEMASECA to distribute dividends or repatriate capital”, among others. The Tribunal has not bound the above facts to be
proven. Also, the Letter from Instructions to Dellepiane/Spiller mentions the Administrative Ordinance. As stated in paragraphs

extended as to give them full and unlimited management of the Companies.

engaged in conduct contrary to the BIT, does not reflect the actual value of these Investments, that
is, of the shares that Claimants have in Monaca and Demaseca. In the Tribunal’s view, the
Venezuelan unlawful acts have had an impact on the value of Claimants’ Investments, that is, on
the value of the shares of Valores and Consorcio in Monaca and Demaseca. Contrary to
Respondent’s allegations, the Tribunal sees no causal link between Mr. Fernandez Barrueco’s and
ADM Latam’s alleged link to the Companies and the possibility or impossibility of transferring
the Companies’ shares. The Tribunal is convinced that no potential purchaser would pay the same
value for Claimants’ shares in Monaca and Demaseca if the BIT-breaching measures did not exist.

712. Having said that, the Tribunal considers that in this case it would be inappropriate to apply the
total fair market value methodology or to take the value of the Investments as zero in the real
scenario. Claimants have not proved that their shares in Monaca and Demaseca do not have the
capacity to generate profits for them, or that the value of Claimants’ shareholding in the Companies
is determined solely by the expectation of the potential compensation that Venezuela shall grant
them for the forced acquisition process under Decree No. 7.394.

713. The Tribunal is of the opinion that this case can be distinguished from the case of Metalclad v.
Mexico. Claimants referred to that arbitration to hold that the standard to be applied to fully
compensate for the damage caused to Valores and Consorcio is monetary compensation equivalent
to the fair market value of the Investments.®%° However, in Metalclad v. Mexico, NAFTA breaches
of fair and equitable treatment and illegal expropriation were found. Unlike this case, it conclude
that Metalclad had “totally lost its investment”, and that, in that case, the damages corresponding
to the breaches of granting fair and equi and ion for ad
equivalent to expropriation would be the same, since both situations entailed the impossibility of
the operation of the confinement and prevented any significant return on Metalclad’s investment.
Now, in the case of CMS v. Argentina, where a breach of the standard of fair and equitable
treatment was found, the tribunal did not order as compensation to the investor the full fair market
value of the investment, but the difference between the hypothetical fair market value of the
claimants’ shares without regulatory changes (namely, without the pesification measures), and the
current fair market value with the regulatory measures taken (with the pesification measures).**”

714. — In addition, the evidence in the record of this arbitration proves that the value of the Investments
during and after the series of measures that constitute breaches of Articles III(1), IV(1) and VII of
the BIT was not zero.

715. The Tribunal shall not present its analysis of Gruma’s reports, but not before clarifying that it shall
proceed to assess the statements contained therein in their context.

716. Gruma’s 2012 20-F Report, submitted on April 30, 2013 to the U.S. Securities & Exchange

that, as a result of that loss of control, Gruma would cease to consolidate the financial information
of the Companies in its financial statements.®*

net investment in Monaca and Demaseca, which would not permit an estimate of any future charge
for such impairment. Gruma considered then that there was the possibility of an impairment in the
investment but it had not been identified and that it was not possible to estimate it at that time. In
short, the Companies had a value, an impairment was possible, but could not be estimated at that
time.

718. On the other hand, the 20-F Report submitted by Gruma to the U.S. Securities & Exchange
Commission on April 30, 2014, corresponding to the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2013
(“Gruma’s 2013 20-F Report”) provides that such company recognized) the linvestovent ‘in Monaca
and D as a financial asset, cl it as an ial asset” ®”
whereby Mr. Spiller recognized at the Hearing that at that time Gruma was not giving for zero the
value of the Companies. In the same report, Gruma’s auditors made an “impairment test”, which
consisted of comparing the carrying values against what could be the fair market value of the
Companies. This exercise necessarily entails that the auditors carried out certain valuation
exercises. Gruma’s 2013 20-F Report establishes that “the potential recoverable amounts using
the income or market approach were higher than the carrying value of these investments and
therefore, no impairment adjustment was deemed necessary”.°°' Based on the foregoing, the
Tribunal considers that the auditors did assign a certain value to the Companies, and that by the
time Gruma’s 2013 20-F Report was filed and after the Administrative Ordinance, Claimants
appeared to believe that they had not lost the full value of their Investments.

 

719. Now, in December 2015 Gruma announced that it was going to write off the carrying value of tis
investments in Venezuela.” The reason expressed to cancel the investment was the strong
depreciation of the bolivar and the macroeconomic situation of Venezuela. This entails that, by the
Valuation Date in January 2013, the Investments were considered not to have a zero value.”

720. The Tribunal then concludes that Claimants have not proved that the Companies ceased to have
any value to Claimants as a result of the measures adopted by Venezuela until early 2013, when
all the alleged actions had been taken. On the contrary, the evidence gathered in this arbitration
and Gruma’s behavior indicate that the Investments in the Companies continued to have value,
although less. Indeed, the Tribunal considers that there is sufficient causal link between
Respondent’s wrongful conduct that the harm suffered by Claimants, corresponding to a decrease
in the value of their Investments in the real scenario.

721. The Tribunal does not agree with Mr. Spiller’s position that the ADM Transaction is not an
adequate indication of the present value of Monaca and Demaseca.™

S.A.B. de CV." (‘GRUMA’) (Mexican Stock Exchange: GRUMAB) announces today that, effective December 31, 2015, it shall

write off its net indirect investment in Molinos Nacionales, C.A. ((MONACA’) and Derivados de Maiz Seleccionado, DEMASECA,

C.A. (‘DEMASECA }). As previously reported, GRUMA lost control of MONACA and DEMASECA on January 22, 2013 and

ceased to consolidate the financial information of these operations. GRUMA continued to reflect the carrying value of these

indirect net ivectoerae in its balance sheet in the ‘Investment in Venezuela Available for Sale’ account. Given the strong

depreciation of the bolivar and Venezuela's macroeconomic situation, GRUMA has decided to write off the carrying value of

indirect net ees in MONACA and DEMASECA, as well as the accounts receivable that certain subsidiaries of GRUMA

have with MONACA. The cancellation shall result in a charge to income of approximately Ps. 4,362 million to be recorded in

December 2015 in the ‘Income (Loss) from Discontinue Operations, Net’ account. The charge is a virtual game, so GRUMA's

722. Indeed, the Tribunal considers that the ADM Transaction reflects the value of the Investments in
the real scenario.** Historical transactions involving or falling on a company subject to valuation
may constitute a fair indication of value. In the current case, this transaction reasonably entails that
the fair market value of the Investments as of the Valuation Date was USD$192.6 million, after
deducting the royalty debt with Azteca International Trademarks, A.G. (“Azteca Trademarks”) to
USD$74.1 million from the USD$266.7 million of the ADM Transaction.

723. It is the Tribunal’s view that this transaction represents a measure of the fair market value of the
Investments after the BIT-breaching measures had been taken by Venezuela.” The transaction
price was established unilaterally by ADM, as can be seen from Article 1.2 of the Local Equity
Interest Purchase Agreement between Archer-Daniels-Midland Company and GRUMA S.A.B. de
C.V. of Valores, of December 14, 2012 (“Valores Purchase Agreement”) and Article 1.2 of the
Local Equity Interests Purchase Agreement between Archer-Daniels-Midland Company and
GRUMA, S.A.B. de C.V. of Consorcio, of December 14, 2012 (“Consorcio Purchase
Agreement”). Also, Mr. Fernando Chico Pardo’s letter of intent reveals that the price established
between ADM and GRUMA had been agreed by Mr. Chico Pardo and ADM before Gruma decided
to exercise its right of first refusal. The Tribunal considers that the documents between Mr. Chico
Pardo and ADM before Gruma exercised its right of first refusal reflect the understanding of two
parties outside of this dispute regarding the value of the ADM Transaction. It is not a price fixed
or determined by Gruma or by Claimants, but the price that a shareholder other than Claimants
fixed and that a third party outside this dispute and not a shareholder of the Companies (Mr. Chico
Pardo) accepted. If ADM unilaterally fixed the price and the third party considered that this was
the market price of the shares and offered to buy them, without it having been demonstrated that
one or the other was in a position to be forced to buy or sell, that is the value which the Tribunal
must take into account as a value freely fixed in the market and which cannot be affected by the
statement subsequently made by ADM and Gruma in the contract concluded between them. At
the time of this representation, the price had already been determined and Gruma’s only option
was to acquire the shares at the price offered by the third party (Mr. Chico Pardo) or at a higher
price.

724. Venezuela is then right when it points out that in the real scenario and for the day following the
Valuation Date, the value of the Companies was not “zero”, as Claimants allege.

725. Upon determining the evidentiary value relating to the ADM Transaction and specifically the
purchase price of the transactions in the Valores Purchase Agreement and the Consorcio Purchase
Agreement, both dated December 14, 2012,°!° the Tribunal considers relevant: (i) that the
Valuation Date set forth by Claimants (January 21, 2013) is only one month after the ADM
Transaction and that only five months after the ADM Transaction the Claimants commenced this
arbitration without proof of an impairment that brought the value of the Companies to “zero”, or
to an additional loss in the value of the Investments, between the date of the ADM Transaction and

current value of MONACA and DEMASECA, claiming that this entails that in the current value, that is, under the MONACA and

DEMASECA measures, are worth 266.7 million. Hart and Vélez make a fundamental mistake here: the transaction was not about

MONACA and DEMASECA. The transaction was about 3 percent, as far as this case is concerned, 3 percent of Valores and

Consorcio. Now, Valores and Consorcio: what is the most important asset towards the end of 2010, 2012? They are not necessarily

the shares since shares do not generate value directly but it is the possibility or the rights that Valores and Rights have to demand

compensation from Venezuela

the Valuation Date or the date of commencement of arbitration; (ii) that there is no evidence that
the value assigned to the shares of Valores and Consorcio in the bid made by Mr. Chico Pardo to
ADM or in the price that it set before Gruma exercised its right of first refusal merely represents
an estimate of the possible compensation that Venezuela would grant for the assets subject to
expropriation after the process of forced acquisition; (iii) that in the ADM Transaction, Gruma did
not amend the allocation of value of the shares it would purchase from ADM, relevant to this
dispute; and (iv) that in the value analysis of other transactions that Claimants’ experts consider
relevant to prove the value in the counterfactual scenario, the acquisition price is taken as the
market price, and therefore, such treatment should be given to the price set in the 2012 ADM
Transaction that only refers to companies in the same sector, but also indicates the share price of
the same companies. Therefore, the Tribunal does not agree with Mr. Spiller’s assertion during the
Hearing that the most important asset of Valores and Consorcio is not the shares in Monaca and
Demaseca, but the right to receive compensation from Venezuela.*!'

726. The Tribunal then concludes that in the real scenario the value of the Investments is USD$192.6
million after deducting the royalty debt to Azteca Trademarks equivalent to USD$74.1 million
from USD$266.7 million corresponding to the 2012 ADM Transaction.

2. Value of the Investments in the counterfactual scenario

727. . After having concluded what the value of the. Investments is in the real scenario, as a result-of
Respondent’s unlawful actions, the Tribunal shall proceed to determine the value of the
Investments in the counterfactual scenario.

728. — First, the Parties agree to measure the value of the Investments in the counterfactual scenario
through the application of the DCF model.”

729.  Dellepiane/Spiller determine the fair market value of Claimants’ respective shareholdings in the
Companies as of January 21, 2013 “excluding the effect of the expropriation and hindrance
measures on the management of such companies and assuming free access to the foreign exchange
market and free transfer abroad of dividends and other investment-related payments”.9'

730. For this purpose, as stated above, they apply a DCF approach and conclude that the value of the
Companies as of the aforementioned date is the sum of USD$653.6 million, from which the value
of the debt with Azteca Trademarks of USD$74.1 million must be deducted to arrive a fair market
value of USD$579.5 million.2"4

731. Dellepiane/Spiller also estimate “the damages caused to Claimants during the year 2012 as a
consequence of the redirection of white corn ordered by Venezuela in benefit of companies
competing with Monaca and Demaseca’®'> which they estimate, once adjusted, in the amount of
USD$7 million. That same redirection, in the opinion of Dellepiane/Spiller, has an impact on the

5" See Hearing, Day 5, Tr. 1007:11-20 (“The transaction was about 3 percent, as to this case, 3 percent of Valores and Consorcio.
Now, Valores and Consorcio: what is the most important asset towards the end of 2010, 2012? It is not necessarily the shares
since the shares do not generate value directly, but rather the possibility or the rights of Valores and Consorcio to demand
compensation from Venezuela for the measures or the expropriation").
912 See, for example, Memorial, §] 259 (“To calculate the fair market value of the Investments, Experts used two methodologies:
@_Discounted Cash Flow, as principal methodology, and ws Relative Valuation, as secondary method to corroborate the
reasonableness of the results obtained from the Di Cash Flow Both imilar results”.
[emphasis added]); Rejoinder, § 588 (“Because MONACA ont DEMASECA remain in the power and under the control of
Claimants, a proper valuation exercise must be based on a comparison between a Discounted Cash Flow (‘DCF') valuation in
the scenario of non-existence of the alleged measures (‘counterfactual scenario’) and a DCF valuation that considers such
measures (‘current scenario’). [emphasis added]

Companies’ estimate of fair market value in that the projections of future corn flour sales are based
in party on quantities actually sold in 2012. An increase in sales in 2012, without the impact of
redirecting translates into an increase in the projection of future sales and the consequent increase
in the fair market value of the Companies. This impact on fair market value is estimated in
USD$43.2 million.

732. Finally, Dellepiane/Spiller explain that they have been instructed by Claimants’ counsel to update
damages from the Valuation Date (January 21, 2013) to July 28, 2014 using two interest rates (a)
the equivalent of Libor plus 4%; and (b) the capital cost of the grain milling and food processing
industry in the United States.

733. In their response to Respondent’s expert criticisms, Dellepiane/Spiller point out that, contrary to
what Venezuelan experts assert, there is no evidence that Mr. Fernandez Barrueco had
shareholding in the Companies on the Valuation Date. In addition, the investigation against ADM
Latam does not mention the Companies. Accordingly, the Companies’ relationships with Mr.
Fernandez Barrueco and ADM Latam do not affect the determination of the value of the
Companies.*'*

734. In responding to Venezuelan experts’ criticism of the DCF valuation model, Dellepiane/Spiller
points out three points they consider fundamental.

735. First, they assert that Hart/Vélez overestimate the country’s risk premium by relying on
Venezuela’s Emerging Markets Bond Index (“EMBI”) as values above 10%, such as that proposed
by Venezuela’s experts, are congruent only with yields observed on sovereign bonds in situations
closed to default. Venezuela’s credit rating as of the Valuation Date (“B1”) indicates a better ability
to pay than that reflected by Venezuela’s EMBI as of that date. This means that Venezuela’s EMBI
at the beginning of 2013 incorp not only ic, political and regulatory risks “but
also additional risks related to Venezuela's potential voluntary default of its international financial
obligations”.°'" That is, they include a risk of expropriation without compensation (or, in other
words, the risk of seizure). The BIT explicitly requires that the breach of the expropriated
investment exclude the effect of the measures, or threat thereof.'® Accordingly, the risk of seizure
should be eliminated in the estimate of WACC to determine the fair market value of the Companies
in a counterfactual scenario (namely, in the absence of measures in breach of the Treaty). They
conclude then that Dellepiane/Spiller’s country risk estimate “(4%) does include the risk the
investment is expropriated, but considers that the investor shall receive fair compensation for such

expropriation (namely, excludes the risk of seizure)” 9"

 

736. Second, Dellepiane/Spiller consider that the application of a size premium in the calculation of the
discount rate is incorrect. First, because the inclusion of such a premium is not widely used in the
financial literature and second, because, contrary to Hart/Vélez’s assertion, the Companies
Gointly) can be considered “large companies” in terms relative to the size of the Venezuelan
market.

737. Finally, Claimants’ experts point out that Hart/Vélez overestimate the cost of debt in dollars “by
directly using an interest rate of 13% on loans in bolivars to discount flows of funds denominated
in dollars, without taking into account that expectations of devaluation of the bolivar against the

918 Dellepiane/Spiller Second Report, $f] 8 and 62-83. The Tribunal considers that the analysis of whether the country risk premium

includes the expropriation risk would be relevant in the FFD model, regardless of the breaches of the Treaty that may be found.

dollar reduce the cost in dollars of loans in bolivars. Since Hart/Vélez estimate a WACC in dollars,
the use of a debt cost rate in bolivars is incorrect”.°?'

738. — For its part, Hart/Vélez consider that the valuation of the Companies should consider the impact
of Claimants’ own actions on the potential sale to a third party, taking into account their
relationship with Mr. Fernandez Barrueco — the subject of a criminal proceeding in progress of
which the seizure was dictated and ADM Latam, an entity which, according to Respondent’s
experts, has admitted acts of corruption in Venezuela.?”

739. After analyzing the Venezuelan corn and wheat market and the Companies’ performance,
Hart/Vélez criticize the DCF model used by Dellepiane/Spiller with respect to input data and the
fundamentals thereof for preparing projections and proceed with an analysis of corn operations
versus wheat operations, production, sales projections, prices and future price projections, costs
and expenses, and the discount rate.”** They also point out that there was an increase in the sales
of the Companies as a result of the management of the special administrators.”

740.  Hart/Vélez question the method of comparable companies used by Dellepiane/Spiller to validate
their calculation in that, on one hand, they did not include transactions in which the Companies
were involved and, on the other hand, they made a mistake in the method of choosing comparable
companies and in the calculation of the control premium.”

741. — They also question Claimants’ proposed interest rate as exaggerated and inappropriate and point
out that the Tribunal must estimate interest on the award.””°

742. To establish the counterfactual value, Hart/Vélez have taken the Dellepiane/Spiller model and
have introduced the following main changes:

“i. Production level: Adjusted to exclude the impact of seizure and special administrators
measures, which contributed to an increase in production between 2010 and 2012:
Operating margin on wheat: Aligned to historical margin levels. iii. Discount rate:
Compass Lexecon used a discount rate of 10.12%, while we recommend a discount rate of
19.16% to adequately justify the risks faced by companies. Most of the difference in the
discount rate comes from the country risk premium, the size risk premium and the cost of
debt”.””

 

   

743. The Tribunal considers that the Companies have an operating and cash flow generation track record
such that the difference between the value of equity in the counterfactual scenario can be
established using the DCF methodology. This methodology is used to determine the value of an
asset at a specific date based on the net cash flows that the asset is expected to generate over time.

744. — Inaddition, Hart/Vélez agree that to determine the counterfactual scenario it is feasible to initially
take the model used by Dellepiane/Spiller. In fact, experts of both Parties carry out an exercise of
calculation of the counterfactual scenario based on the same model, but with substantial
differences in the following aspects:

 

(i) Sales of wheat flour and the impact of measures subject to dispute.

Claimants’ experts perform a valuation by taking sales volumes from 2008
to 2012, while Respondent’s experts estimate that the analysis period should
be from 2003 to 2009.

(ii) The impact on the price of the potential sale to a third party of Claimants’
links with Mr. Fernandez Barrueco and ADM Latam, an entity which,
according to Respondent’s experts, has admitted acts of corruption in
Venezuela.

(iii) The operating margin on wheat that Respondent’s experts believe should be
adjusted to its historical values.

(iv) The discount rate that Dellepiane/Spiller consider should be set at 10.12%
and that Hart/Vélez set at 19.16%. This difference in calculation is
particularly relevant to the difference between the experts with respect to
the country risk premium; the risk premium by size that Respondent’s
experts consider should be included and that Claimants’ experts reject; and
the cost of the debt that, according to Claimants’ experts, have been
overestimated by Respondent’s experts.

In addition, the-Parties differ in the applicable interest rate and the application or non-application
of taxes on the sums payable for damages.

In the applicable DCF model for determining the value of the Investments in the counterfactual
scenario, the Tribunal shall apply the items over which the Parties have no differences. Unless the
Tribunal indicates otherwise by infra-accepting the ‘criticisms made by Respondent and by
Hart/Vélez in their reports, it shall take those figures included in the DCF model from Claimants’
experts in their compensation model for finding them reasonable.

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal also announces that it shall take as its valuation date the
proposal of the Claimants, that is, the day before the publication of the Administrative Ordinance.
Although the Tribunal concluded that it did not result in an expropriation, as Claimants alleged, it
did constitute Venezuela’s last action in the chain of measures that the Tribunal has found as
breaching the BIT and it is also the valuation date referred to by the Parties and their experts in
this arbitration without a different valuation date being raised or suggested.

The Tribunal shall now refer to each of the items pointed out in paragraph 744 above, as well as
to other differences between the Parties with respect to the DCF model with the least impact on
the valuation of the Investments.

a. Differences of the Parties with respect to the DCF model in the counterfactual
scenario

(i) Sales volume

Dellepiane/Spiller estimate future sales volumes (wheat flour, corn flour, etc.) based on average
observed sales from 2008 to 2012 and project their increase between 2013 and 2011 according to
Venezucla’s population growth projections (1.6% per year).

Upon making adjustments to the economic model proposed by Claimants, Hart/Vélez point out
that in calculating future sales, account must be taken of a historical period during which the
measures subject to dispute were not in force, otherwise there would be no counterfactual scenario.
Accordingly, they point out that it is not possible to take into account the sales period analyzed by

Claimants’ experts (2008-2012), but rather a period prior to the measures adopted by Venezuela
(2003-2009). On this subject, they state that if the Tribunal believes that the value of Monaca
should exclude both the benefits and the expenses generated by the seizure and special
administration (namely, the counterfactual scenario), then the production period should be a
period that is not influenced by the effects of the seizure and special administration measures. This
period would be prior to 2010.7

751. The Tribunal does not agree with the adjustment made by Respondent’s experts for two
fundamental reasons. First, there is no evidence that the sales results of the Companies during the
period included in the economic model of Claimants’ experts were the result of the management
of special administrators or of the measures adopted by Venezuela and which are the subject of the
dispute.” Second, it is contradictory to seek, on one hand, to dismiss the results obtained during
the period 2008-2012 alleging positive interference of the special administrators and, at the same
time, to argue that during the same period the administrators of the Companies were the Claimants
and not the special administrators, and that the Venezuelan officials had no interference in
administrative decisions. In short, Respondent’s experts seek to make an adjustment on the on the
basis, not proven that the special administrators and the special measures adopted by Venezuela
generated an increase in sales over the 2003-2009 period.

752.  Respondent’s experts have insisted that the value of the Companies as of the Valuation Date is
what is reflected in the ADM Transaction. They have also pointed out that, if the real scenario is
to be compared with the counterfactual scenario for the purpose of determining damages, the value
in the first of the above scenarios would be the ADM Transaction and in the second the value of
the Investments in the absence of the measures. This means that in order for the proposed
adjustment to be successful, it must be proven that it was the measures adopted by Venezuela or
the management of the special administrators or both that generated the increase in sales in the
period analyzed by Claimants’ experts, an issue that the Tribunal does not find proven.

753. The Tribunal considers it decisive that the portfolio of products marketed by both companies are
basic staple foods, which from 2008 to 2012 represented approximately 95.7% of the total
production of Monaca and Demaseca, and that the corn flour and wheat flour markets grew at
annual rates of 2.3% and 1.6% respectively from 1992 to 2010 in Venezuela.

754. In addition, the Tribunal finds that Dellepiane/Spiller is correct in stating that in order to estimate
future sales volumes for Monaca and Demaseca, sales volumes should be projected based on the
portfolio of products existing at the Valuation Date, and not taking into account products whose
transactions were discontinued in previous years.” If the Tribunal relied on discontinued products,
it would not conform to the model that seeks to re-establish the situation that would have existed
in the absence of breaches of the Treaty.

755. Nor does the Tribunal find reason in Hart/Vélez’s criticism of the Dellepiane/Spiller model
regarding the utilization factor of the Monaca and Demaseca plants. As mentioned above, it is
reasonable to project an increase in sales in accordance with Venezuela’s population growth
projections (at 1.6% per year). In addition, the Tribunal notcs that the installed capacity of the
production plants is sufficient to maintain future sales projections.

The Tribunal finds duly substantiated and supported the figures on which Claimants’ experts
calculate the sales volumes of Monaca and Demaseca, figures that are not the subject of detailed
analysis by Respondent’s experts except that, as noted, those experts believe that a period should
have been taken prior to the one chosen by Claimants’ experts.

Accordingly, the Tribunal shall take the valuation determined for this item by Claimants’ sales
volume experts, without the adjustments proposed to the model by Hart/Vélez.

(ii) Impact of the relationships with Mr. Fernandez Barrueco and ADM Latam

With respect to the potential impact on the assessment of Claimants’ or the Companies’ alleged
relationship with Mr. Fernandez Barrueco or ADM Latam, Hart/Vélez seeks to break the causal
link between Venezuela’s actions and Claimants’ alleged lower value for the Companies.

For the purpose, they point out that:

“a due diligence process would have revealed warning signs that could affect the
attractiveness of companies before third parties interested in acquiring them, in particular
the involvement with Mr. Fernandez Barrueco and ADM Latin America on several
occasions. Gruma, as the parent company of Monaca and Demaseca, partnered with Mr.
Fernandez Barrueco in 2004 and again in 2006, although it was involved in non-
transparent transactions with other parties. While Mr. Fernandez Barrueco transferred his
shares in Valores and Consorcio in June 2008, the manner in which the transaction
occurred could raise red flags. It was not a clean sale of the shares; instead, a transfer was
made to a trust, which curiously contains his initials in the name (RFB Holdings)”.”"

With respect to ADM Latam, Respondent’s experts point out that Respondent sold wheat to
Monaca between 2004 and 2012 and, that, although the Companies were not mentioned in the U.S.
Department of Justice’s report in the investigation to ADM Latam, the truth is that

“Sophisticated buyers probably did not want to be involve with entities that have the same
remote probability of being involved in illegal or questionable activities, such as
MONACA and DEMASECA. Compass Lexecon’s assertion that an insurance or
contractual indemnity clause would protect against such risks is false. Full compensation
for insurance or contractual clauses cannot be guaranteed, and even if there were able to
indemnify against participation, the buyer would still be exposed to losing the investment,
making it unattractive. In addition, the investor would be buying into a company with

employees possibly involved in criminal, fraudulent or inappropriate activities”.°*

The Tribunal notes that Respondent’s experts make no estimate of the impact on the value of the
Companies of their alleged association with Mr. Fernandez Barrueco or ADM Latam. For the
Tribunal moreover, it is not clear — because the conclusion of Respondent’s experts is not clear
either — whether they claim that he Companies have no value because of their alleged association
with Mr. Fernandez Barrueco or ADM Latam, or whether the value should be decreased by that
alleged association. If the first thing, the Respondent’s experts would be against their own assertion
that the value of the ADM Transaction corresponds to the value of the Companies. If the second,
Respondent’s experts do not provide any basis or element that allows to determine the impact of
these associations in the value of the Companies.

In addition, however, the exi: or not of a i ip between Mr. F Barrueco and

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 155 of 375

Claimants and the Companies is a matter of debate before the Venezuelan courts and the delay in
the judicial decision on the issue and the treatment that Venezuela has given to Claimants in the
process in which they seek to clarify it is precisely one of the actions that the Tribunal has taken
into account to determine the breach of the BIT. The Tribunal cannot then accept that, on one hand,
Claimants are prevented or hindered from having access to the possibility of proving whether there
is a connection with Mr. Fernandez Barrueco and, on the other hand, give that connection as true
and proven for the purpose of concluding that the Companies have no value or that their value
should be substantially reduced.

763. As for ADM Latam, beyond being a supplier of wheat to the Companies, the Tribunal does not
find any evidence or indication that such a link may affect the value of the Companies because an
investigation has been opened into ADM Latam in the United States.

764. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that there is no discount or deduction to the value of the
Companies, for the alleged relationship with Mr. Fernandez Barrueco or ADM Latam.

(iii) The operating margin

765. Two fundamental criticisms raise Hart/Vélez to the model proposed by Dellepiane/Spiller. On one
hand, Hart/Vélez argue that in the projection of Claimants’ experts, wheat prices shall exceed
historical trends. On the other hand, Dellepiane/Spiller-not only assumes that costs shall increase
but also that the prices that Monaca would charge Venezuelan customers for wheat flour would
increase even more.”

766. Inaddition, according to Respondent’s experts, Dellepiane/Spiller did not project the selling price
of wheat flour per kilogram, but rather calculated the price per ton, took its expected costs and
selling prices in bolivars and converted them into US dollars,°>4 and assumed that wheat costs
would increase in the future from USD$1,344 per ton level in 2012 to USD$1,548 per ton in 2022,
that is, an increase of 15%, However, for wheat flour prices, Claimants’ experts assume that the
2012 price of USD$1,603 per ton would increase to USD$1,902 per ton, or an increase of 19%.”

767.  Hart/Vélez point out that these are ungrounded assumptions by Claimants’ experts to inflate the
gross margin of wheat in their valuation as they assume that Monaca would charge customers more
for wheat flour and receive a higher profit.

Dellepiane/Spiller add that prices would not increase gradually, but would increase almost
immediately after the Valuation Date and continue with the pricing scheme forever, which “is not
a valid assumption since it is unreasonable for MONACA to continue to take advantage of its
customers perpetually, without facing competition or migration to alternative products in the face

of such a scheme”.°*

768. Respondent’s experts conclude that beyond the above problems, Dellepiane/Spiller’s pricing
assumptions are unreasonable and that it is therefore necessary to adjust Monaca’s wheat flour
prices in line with the historical operating margin and raise those prices with inflation rather than
the Dellepiane/Spiller pricing scheme that they consider “fictitious”. The effect of the proposed
adjustment to wheat flour prices by Hart/Vélez is a reduction in the value of the Companies by
USD$104.5 million.”

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 156 of 375

769. The Tribunal has reviewed the cost growth estimates for wheat and prices for wheat flour proposed
by Dellepiane/Spiller in their economic model, and does not consider them to be unreasonable or
to result in fictitious prices that warrant an adjustment of the magnitude proposed by Respondent’s
experts. The model, proposed by Claimants’ experts, contrary to what Respondent’s experts claim,
takes into account historical trends and the estimation of a 15% cost growth and 19% price growth
ina scenario in which the measures are no longer in effect and the Companies can operate without
restrictions. In the context of this market, the model proposed by Dellepiane/Spiller is neither
unreasonable nor fictitious. Respondent’s experts do not include, in addition, a clear and
convincing explanation of how they arrive at an adjustment of USD$104.5 million, which differs
from the “unreasonable” rating of the detailed exercise presented in their two reports by Claimants”
experts.

770. — The Tribunal considers the sale price calculations proposed by Claimants to be appropriate.* As
Dellepiane/Spiller prove, if 2008 were to be taken as the base year for the analysis of sales prices
of wheat flour — as Hart/Vélez maintains- the Tribunal would be basing itself on an arbitrary year
to establish future sales:°” when extending the analysis period, it is noted that sales prices have
increased above Venezuelan inflation. Therefore, it would be reasonable for the selling prices of
wheat flour to evolve in line with Venezuelan inflation, and for Monaca to be able to pass on to its
selling prices a portion of the expected devaluation effect.

771. Likewise, the Tribunal concludes, for the corn flour segment in the regulated sector, that it would
not be appropriate to assume that Venezuela shall maintain a policy of price updating lagging along
the entire planning horizon.” With regard to the sales prices of corn flour in the unregulated sector,
Dellepiane/Spiller are right to criticize the comparison of Harl/Vélez between prices denominated
in different currencies.”"!

772. Finally, the Tribunal takes as projection of the variable cost of the purchase of corn that based on
expected Venezuelan inflation, as proposed by Dellepiane/Spiller.” Hart/Vélez simply make a
general criticism of the fact that Claimants’ experts did not conduct historical analyses of the
variable costs of Monaca and Demaseca,™* and asset that “there were other competitive factors
that produced operating losses of MONACA and DEMASECA in the corn flour business during
the period 2009-20127."

 

773. The Tribunal shall, accordingly, take for purposes of calculation of operating margins on wheat
flour [and corn flour] the DCF economic model submitted by Claimants’ experts without the
adjustments proposed by Respondent's experts.

(iv) The discount rate

774. For the purpose of discounting the estimated future cash flows for Monaca and Demaseca as of the
Valuation Date, Dellepiane/Spiller used the WACC. WACC represents the average cost of the
Companies in raising funds from shareholders (capital) and lenders (debt) and has three main
components: (i) the cost of equity; (ii) the cost debt; and (iii) the capital structure or relative weight
between debt and equity. Hart/Vélez do not question the methodology chosen by
Dellepiane/Spiller to discount cash flows but consider that Dellepiane/Spiller does not adequately

take into account the risks to which Monaca and Demaseca are subject.’

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 157 of 375

775. One of the substantial differences between the experts of the Parties is that Dellepiane/Spiller
consider that the discount rate should be 10.12% while the experts of Venezuela set it at 19.16%.
The Tribunal shall then refer to those elements of WACC that have essential relevance in the
difference between the experts, namely, the size risk premium the country risk premium, the
market risk premium, and the cost of the debt.

(a) Size premium

776. The Tribunal is not convinced that it is appropriate to apply the size premium advocated by
Respondent's experts. The Tribunal considers that if'a size risk premium is to be applied —a matter
which is debatable as proven by the Parties’ submissions — it must take into account the market in
which the Companies operate.

777. According to Respondent's experts “small businesses have risk characteristics that differ from
those of large firms. Large companies have access to more resources to react better and adapt to
factors that could negatively affect the business, such as competition, economic crises, etc. Smaller
firms, on the other hand, have fewer resources to react and adapt to these kinds of factors”.
Even assuming that the hypothesis put forward is true, the Tribunal considers that the alleged size
risk must be measured taking into account the environment in which the Companies operate, that

- is, the competition, crises and other factors. in the environment in which they operate: the
Venezuelan environment.

 

778. Respondent's experts determine the size premium by comparing the size of the Companies with
the large U.S. conglomerates without proposing the adjustments that would be necessary given
that the Companies operate in Venezuela.” The Tribunal considers that, in this case, it would be
appropriate to compare the size of Monaca and Demaseca with the companies in the market where
they operate.”* Indeed, for the Venezuelan market, Companies would be considered “large” if they
were measured by their income, by the number of their employees or by the size of their share
capital compared to the market capitalization of the companies listed on the Caracas Stock
Exchange as of December 31, 2012. Therefore, the Tribunal does not find it appropriate to apply
a size premium applying parameters that are not comparable.

779. The Tribunal shall therefore no apply a size premium in determining the value of the Companies
for the purpose of liquidating damages.

(b) Country risk premium

780. The Parties’ experts agree on the need to apply a country risk premium. They also agree that the
country risk premium reflects the differential represented by the additional risk of operating in
Venezuela instead of the United States,” and that the appropriate methodology for estimating
country risk is frequently to determine the differential between the yield of sovereign bonds issued
in dollars by the host country (in this case Venezuela) and bonds issued by the United States
Treasury with similar maturity (measured by the EMBI).””

781.  Dellepiane/Spiller consider that, in the case of Venezuela:

“However, the use of the spread of their own sovereign bonds during the analysis period

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 158 of 375

is not appropriate as it reflects the risk of countries in situations close de default. In
particular, the spread on Venezuelan bond yields averaged 1,087 basis points (namely,
10.87%) over the last five years and stood at 776 basis points on January 21, 2013.
According to Professor Damodaran, a country risk premium of 10% is attributable to
countries with a rating of “Caa3”, which represents the lowest tier of the category of
speculative bonds in bad standing and subject to a very high credit risk (“Caa”). Other
arbitral tribunals have concluded that, in situations close to default, the interest rate
differential is no longer an appropriate measure of the country risk faced by a private
investor”:95!

782. Next, they point out that Venezuela’s credit rating at the Valuation Date was “B1” which would
entail a lower risk premium than that shown by its sovereign bonds at that date. They conclude that
“sovereign bond credit ratings are normally given exclusively by the country’s economic capacity
to repay, which is determined primarily by macroeconomic factors such as the level of reserves
and the budget deficit”. They also claim that

“Tn the last five years, countries with similar repayment capacity to Venezuela were able
to place debt at substantially lower rates than Venezuela had to offer for its own bonds.
This is an indi ication that the term yields of Venezuelan sovere’ ign bonds are affected by
considerations other than their ability to repay the debt, and, accordingly, their credit ratin

and are rather related to the risk of willingness to pay, and to a general investment climate

perceived as _a hostile by foreign investors. That is, conduct that is contrary to the
investment treaty and should therefore be excluded from the calculation of country risk in

order to oF mine compensation based on the fair market value established in the
treaty” °° |

783. Therefore, Claimants’ experts consider that, under these specific conditions, the EMBI does not
represent an appropriate measure on the risks that should be considered in the fair market value of
the Companies.”

784.  Dellepiane/Spiller then conclude that “in order to avoid contaminating the calculation of country
risk by factors that are not reflected in Venezuela's credit rating, we use as a measure of country
risk the average yield (above the risk-free rate) of the bonds from countries with credit ratings
similar to Venezuela, estimated by Professor Damodaran at 400 basis points (namely 4.0%)".
In addition, they argue that the use of Venezuela’s EMBI is not appropriate for estimating the
discount rate of a private company whose operational risks are not equal to those of a state
contractor that depends purely and exclusively on the contracts with Respondent.®* Neither do the
companies depend so closely on the level of income or the economic cycle, nor do they have the
Venezuelan State as ; client, with the risk of defaulting on sovereign bonds.°°*

785.  Hart/Vélez consider that Dellepiane/Spiller’s reasoning is contradictory in that they assert, on the
one hand, that the sovereign bond spread is not appropriate in this circumstance because it reflects
that Venezuela is in a bad financial situation and subject to a very high credit risk and yet they
argue that Venezuela's credit rating at the Valuation Date was higher — a “B” rating — which would
entail a lower level of risk.°”

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 159 of 375

786. Respondent’s experts add that the calculation of Dellepiane/Spiller not only ignores the actual
country risk associated with Venezuela, but also uses a group of countries with a rating similar to
that of Venezuela but does not analyze whether the risk of those countries is comparable to that of
Venezuela. In fact, according to them, it is clear that this substitute risk spread does not fully reflect
the country risk inherent in Venezuela.°*

787. For Respondent’s experts, “the appropriate country risk assessment for the Companies is the
spread of sovereign bonds using Venezuelan bonds (({EMBI])”.°° Claimants’ own experts agree
that by the Valuation Date the five-year average of this spread was 10.87% (or 1.087 basis points).
This data, in Respondent’s experts opinion, adequately represents the additional risk that should
be added to a calculation of cost of capital based on U.S. data for Companies and adds that “this
country risk premium does not include forfeiture risk, which can also be considered as part of a
country risk adjustment, nor does it include currency risks in its cash flows ”.°

788. Insummary, although both Parties’ experts agree that the spread between the yield on Venezuelan
dollar-denominated sovereign bonds and U.S. Treasury bonds with similar maturities (as measured
by EMBI) is often the appropriate measure to determine country risk, and although both agree that
for the Valuation Date the five-year average of this spread was 10.87%, the experts of Claimants
believe that in this case it would not be appropriate to apply this methodology.

789. The Tribunal shall analyze the differences on the issue of the country risk premium in the specific
context in which they were raised by the Parties’ experts in this arbitration. In this context, the
Tribunal disagrees with Respondent’s expert assessment. First, while these experts insist that the
spread between U.S. sovereign bonds and Venezuelan bonds (EMBI) should be taken, they do not
specifically explain why this spread would reflect more than the risk of the respective country not
paying its debt and how that risk would impact a specific business or line of business specifically
in Venezuela. Nor does it explain why this differential “does not include forfeiture risk, which can
also be considered as part of a country risk adjustment nor does it include currency risks in their
cash flows”,°*' or how that differential and Respondent’s risk of inability to pay impacts the
estimate of the discount rate or private equity companies, whose investment is not tied to state-
owned resources, who could initiate a similar transaction in a different country, who do not rely
on contracts with Respondent, and who do not have Respondent as their primary customer or
purchaser.

790. In summary, the Tribunal agrees with Dellepiane/Spiller that the country risk measure proposed
by Venezuela does not realistically or reasonably measure the risk of the Investments in Monaca
and Demaseca. For the Companies, as companies whose sales continued to increase despite
Venezuela’s economic situation, that sell basic necessities, that do not depend on the State as their
main client, the Tribunal considers it less convenient to apply as a country risk premium the market
risk perception on Venezuela’s sovereign bonds, bearing in mind that it has not been specifically
explained either: (i) why it would not be relevant or appropriate to take into account the specific
characteristics of the business of Monaca and Demaseca, or (ii) how Respondent’s proposed
measure (EMBI) is appropriate to the specific situation of Monaca and Demaseca.

791. The Parties have not submitted an alternative form of country risk calculation and the Tribunal
could not make an estimate on bases that the Parties have not submitted or alleged. The Tribunal
considers, for the reasons stated above, that the country risk rate for this specific case that is most
reasonable with the activity of the Companies and the sector in which they operate is that proposed

by Claimants’ experts and, therefore, shall take 4% as the country risk premium.
(c) Market risk premium

792. The market risk premium represents the additional return on the risk-free rate that investors require
to make investments in shares rather than risk-free assets.°®

793. The Tribunal agrees with Hart/Vélez estimate of the market risk premium (also “ERP”) as an
arithmetic average. The appropriate ERP to use to estimate the cost of the Companies’ own fund
as of January 21, 2013 is then the ERP offer rate in a long-term horizon estimated at 6.11%.

(d) Cost of debt and its components

794.  Hart/Vélez advocate applying the real historical debt cost of Monaca and Demaseca before taxes,
for a total of 13%, while Dellepiane/Spiller calculate the cost of debt through a synthetic
approach.°

795. The Tribunal has decided not to apply the cost of the debt as proposed by Venezuela, since it
applies an interest rate denominated in bolivars. The Tribunal finds that Claimants are right that
the discount rate and discounted cash flows must be denominated in the same currency. Hart/Vélez
would be overestimating the cost of the debt in dollars precisely because of the exchange risk
between the bolivar and the dollar, and the existence of an expectation of devaluation.

796. However, there is no disagreement among Parties’ experts on how the synthetic cost of the debt
would be calculated (composed of: i) the risk-free rate; (ii) the industry risk premium; and (iii) the
country risk premium). Experts fundamentally agree on the industry risk rate, so the substantial
difference for the calculation of the cost debt is in the risk-free rate and the country risk premium.?®

797. As for the latter, the Tribunal has already indicated that it shall take a country risk premium of 4%.

798. With respect to the risk-free rate, the Tribunal considers that the corresponding rate for 10-year
United States Treasury bonds should be applied.

799. First, because there must be a coincidence between the horizon of the security chosen and that of
the assets being valued. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants’ expert’s assessment
that this horizon “is measured in terms of ‘duration’ which is a technical term in finance that
measures the weighted average time until cash flows are paid to the instrument holder”.% \f the
calculation of the cash flows (the “duration” of the cash flows) of Monaca and Demaseca is eight
years, the period is similar to the duration of a ten-year U.S. Treasury bond, which at the Valuation
Date was approximately nine years. It is, therefore, the measure closest to the horizon of duration
of the assets valued.

800. Second, because the duration of these instruments is similar to that of the market portfolio, they
have low sensitivity to unexpected changes in inflation and have a low liquidity premium.

801. Finally, because the reasoning presented by Claimants’ experts in this arbitration has been
supported by abundant and forceful references to the financial literature, including the
of fe such as Damod: and Copeland, while the criticism

presented by Respondent’s experts is based on subjective appraisals and particularly on its
experience in these matters.

 

 

 

 

802. The Parties agree on the calculation of the industry risk premium at 1.5%.

803. The Tribunal shall then apply the risk-free rate proposed by Claimants of 1.80%.

804. Thus, the synthetic costs of debt would be the result of the sum of i) the risk-free rate (1.8%); ii)
the industry risk premium (1.5%); and iii) the country risk premium (4%), namely, 7.3%.

805. Taking into conisderation the above, the discount rate to be applied would be 10.2%, according to
the following adjusted table:

Cost of own capital:
Risk-free rate 1.8%
ERP 6.11%
Beta (adjusted end) 0.93%
Country risk premium 4%
Size risk premium 0%
11.47%
Debt cost after taxes:
Debt cost before taxes 4%
Industry premium 1.5%
Venezuela’s tax rate 34%
482%
Capital Structure:
Debt-to-equity ratio 23.5%
Debt-to-total capital ratio 19.03%
Own capital to total capital ratio 80.97
WACC (Discount rate) 10.2%
(v) Damages due to redirection of corn

806. It is not in dispute that in 2012 Venezuela ordered the Companies to “redirect” 86,400 MT of white
corn form their property to other Venezuelan companies.

807. Claimants consider that the “redirection” caused them a damage that they calculate, pointing out
that it entailed a decrease of 27,472 MT in the corn flour sales of the Companies in 2012. The
figure of 27,472 MT represents the difference between budgeted sales (158,114 MT) and sales
actually observed (130,642 MT) during the months of April through December 2012 (period within
which corn from Monaca and Demaseca was destined to other companies in compliance with the
“redirecting” measure).?”

808. The Tribunal has ruled that the order to redirect corn flour constitutes a breach of the Treaty.°*

The Tribunal shall then accept the calculation of the impact of the redirection of corn submitted by
Claimants, but it shall adjust it taking into account the WACC corrected under the aforementioned
parameters,

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 162 of 375

809. The reasons that lead the Tribunal to this conclusion are the following: First, by redirecting to third
parties the corn that the Companies had for sale, the Companies ceased to dispose of assets of their
property that they would have sold in the normal course of their operations, Second, because in
order to estimate the impact of the redirection, it is necessary to include in the sales of the
Companies corresponding to the period in which the redirection took place, the tons that were not
sold as a consequence thereof. Third, because nothing in the documents and evidence provided or
in the Companies’ financial information suggests, as Respondent experts suggest, that the tons of
corn redirected would not have been sold or would have been sold at a different price or margin
than that presented by Claimants. Finally, because adjusting sales, eliminating the impact of
redirection, affects the basis on which the fair market value of the Companies is determined. The
foregoing also demonstrates that there is a sufficient causal link between Venezuela’s conduct
contrary to the BIT and the loss suffered by Claimants.

810. Taking then the marginal contribution (difference between net sales and variable production costs)
of the corn flour segment (USD$72.6 million in 2012 which is equivalent to USD$399 per MT),
an increase in sales of 27,472 MT would result in an increase in the Companies’ marginal
contribution of USD$11.0 million (27,472 MT * USD$399 per MT). Excluding taxes and royalty

 

;, the Ce ies could have g i cash flows to Claimants of USD$6.6
million during 2012, which adjusted to January 21, 2013, with WACC of 10.2% results in USD$7.0
million.

811. As noted above, failure to redirect white corn in 2012 would affect the calculation basis for

calculating the Companies’ fair market value as of the Valuation Date which would increase by
USD$43.2 million as of January 21, 2013. Accordingly, the total damages caused to Claimants by
the redirection of white corn in 2012 is equivalent to USD$50.2 million as of the Valuation Date.

(vi) Royalty debt

812. The Parties agree, and the Tribunal also understands this, that the value of the Companies must be
decreased by the amount corresponding to the debt for royalties amounting to USD$74.1 million.

35 Payment in favor of Claimants

813. Based on the foregoing, the payment to which Claimants are entitled is the difference between the
value of the Investments in the actual scenario, which corresponds to the estimated value resulting
from the ADM Transaction - USD$192.6 million - and not to a “zero” value as claimed by
Claimants, and the value of the Investments in the counterfactual scenario, which, applying the

d variables, including interest, ponds to the sum of USD$572.8 million, That
difference is USD$380.2 million. To the foregoing, one must add: (i) USD$7.0 million
corresponding to the increase in the marginal contribution that would have been generated by the
additional flows that Monaca and Demaseca would have generated for Claimants had it not been
for Venezuela’s conduct with respect to the redirection of corn; and (ii) USD$43.2 million
corresponding to the increase in the fair market value of the Investments in the absence of the
redirection of corn. Accordingly, the payment to which Claimants are entitled is USD$430.4
million.

814. The Tribunal finally notes that Respondent’s previous valuations or those involving Respondent
in 2010 and 2011,° prove that Claimants’ valuation based on the DCF model — indicative of the
value of the Investments’ in the counterfactual scenario — is reasonable. The circumstances in
which the appraisals were made, in the context of the negotiations that took place after the issuance

of Decree No. 7.394 are of great relevance. These valuations range from USD$574 million to
USD$659.1 million. For its part, the Tribunal has concluded that by applying the DCF method, the
value of the Investments in the counterfactual scenario is USD$572.8 million.

4. Interest and taxes

815. The Treaty does not contain an express clause relating to the payment of interest.°”” However, as
noted above, the Tribunal iders that the ip ion to be paid by V la to Claimants
should be determined by applying the principle of full reparation.””' Accordingly, the interest
applied by the Tribunal must restore Claimants to the position they would be in if the breach had
not occurred. In this sense, the Tribunal shares the position taken by the tribunal in Vivendi v.
Argentina (Il), according to which “the purpose of the award of interest is to compensate for
damages resulting from the fact that, during the period of non-payment by the debtor, the creditor
is deprived of the use and disposition of that sum that he was supposed to receive”.*”

816. The Parties do not dispute that interest should be recognized on the sums due to Claimants for
damages,*”? but their experts discuss the applicable rate.°” Both accept that interest can be paid on
the six-month LIBOR rate, but disagree as to whether the rate to be applied is LIBOR plus 4%
(Claimants) or LIBOR plus 2% (Respondent)." Claimants’ experts have not provided a
reasonable justification for applying the fee they are requesting; they basically claim that it was
the fee that the attorneys requested them to apply.°”*.Respondent’s experts, for their part, submit a
study of the ICSID awards in which interest has been applied to support their position on the rate
to be applied.”

817. The Tribunal does not find, nor to Claimants invoke, a compelling reason to liquidate interest in
the form and rate proposed by Claimants’ experts. Considering the circumstances of the case and
the merits presented by the Parties’ experts, the Tribunal finds it reasonable to apply a rate of
LIBOR + 2%.

818. | Once the rate has been fixed, it is for the Tribunal to determine the dies a quo. If it were a case of
direct expropriation, the determination of the starting point for the application of interest would
have a greater degree of certainty. However, as the tribunal in Azurix v. Argentina noted, where
there is an indirect expropriation or breach of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment
—as in this case — the determination is more difficult and less certain, unless there is an act that
results in a clear dispossession of the investment.?”*

819.  Inthis case, there is no single action that resulted in Venezuela’s breach of the Treaty, but rather a
series of actions that lead the Tribunal to conclude that Venezuela breached its obligation under
Articles IV, II] and VII of the BIT.

820. The Tribunal has considered the Parties’ submissions, the opinions of the experts and the starting
points of the different assessments proposed and finds that although there is a debate about the
effects of the Administrative Ordinance and whether it led to the expropriation of the > Companies,
a circumstance that the Tribunal has d ly, the
Ordinance maintained the powers of the special administrators and is, according to the evidence

on the record, the last measure directly addressed to Claimants that keeps the special administrators
while the precautionary measures remain indefinite, the origin of the Administrative Ordinance.
Interest shall be liquidated, accordingly, at a rate of Libor + 2% from the date of the Administrative
Ordinance until the date of payment to Claimants.

821. The Parties also disagree as to whether interest should be calculated in a simple or compound
manner. On one hand, Claimants assert that the principle of full reparation requires that interest be
calculated in a composite manner, in order to place Claimants in the same position that they would
have had if Respondent had not taken the unlawful measures at issue.°” On the other hand,
Respondent submits that, under international law, compound interest is appropriate only when
justified by special circumstances; however, Claimants have not submitted any special
circumstances justifying deviation from the general rule of international law, which provides for
the application of simple interest.°”

822. The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that, in this case, the principle of full reparation requires the
updating of the indemnity amount by the application of a compound interest rate. This reflects both
the prevailing practice among investment tribunals,”*' and the prevailing reality in the world of
finance today.

823. As regards taxes, since it is a compensation for the loss of value of Companies resulting from
breaches of Articles IV, IH and VII of the BIT, the Tribunal finds no reason to liquidate taxes on -
the amount of compensation. The Tribunal notes that beyond holding that a tax-free payment is
not due, Respondent’s experts do not state a reason or basis for taxing this payment, nor do they
state the nature of the tax or the legal provision requiring its collection.

Vil. COSTS
A. CLAIMANTS?’ POSITION

824. Appealing to the “broad discretion” of the Tribunal to distribute the costs and expenses of
arbitration, and based on the principle that “costs follow event” and the principle of full
reparation of damages,” Claimants request that Respondent be ordered to pay court costs and that
all costs described in Section II of their Costs Brief be reimbursed at a reasonable commercial rate
from the date of the award until the date of payment thereof. According to Claimants, the costs
paid by Valores and Consorcio in this arbitration proceeding through April 21, 2016 amount to
USD$9,893,930.°8 This amount should be added to USD$100,000 corresponding to the payment
of the last advance payment requested by the Center, which was made by Claimants on June 14,
2017.

825. Respondent submits that Claimants’ procedural behavior “is far from the principles of good
procedural faith” and, accordingly, requests the Tribunal t to order Respondent to pay all costs and
expenses of the arbitral dings and to p pondent for the incurred in
its defense.°® According to Respondent, the costs incurred by Venezuela in this arbitral proceeding
through April 22, 2016 amount to USD$5,674,448.52 not including administrative costs of
ICSID.%87

826. _In the alternative, Respondent requests that the Tribunal orders Claimants to pay the costs that
would be directly and exclusively attributable to their actions or omissions.” In this regard,
Venezuela alleges that Claimants did not provide documents that supported the findings of their
damage experts and that were necessary for their own experts to verify the assessment made by
them. Respondent submits that the costs associated with obtaining such documents — the sum of
USD$118,996. 15 — are attributable to the negligence of the Claimants and, accordingly, should be
borne by them.%*?

Cc. ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBUNAL

827. The Tribunal considers, and the Parties do not appear to dispute, that under Article 61(2) of the
ICSID Convention and Rule 28(1) of the Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal has broad power to
determine the costs of arbitration and the apportionment of such costs between the Parties.” These
costs include, on one hand, the costs of the arbitration — that is, The Tribunal’s fees and expenses,
ICSID’s administrative costs and direct expenses — and, on the other hand, the fees and expense of
legal representation incurred by Parties in connection with the arbitration. The costs of arbitration,
including the Tribunal’s fees and expense, ICSID’s administrative expenses and direct expenses,
amount to USD$682,245.24. These costs were paid with advances made by Claimants.”!

The breakdown of the arbitration costs is as follows:

Arbitrator Fees and Expenses USD$471,986.72
ICSID Administrative Charges USD$128,000.00
Direct Expenses USD$82,258.52

Total USD$682,245.24

986 Respondent's Cost Writ, § 10.

°87 Respondent's Cost Writ, § II.B. The costs claimed by Respondent are: (i) legal fees of Foley Hoag LLP (USD$4,195,000); (b)
experts’ fees (USD$1,073,142.07) and (c) administrative costs (USD$406,306.45), without including ICSID administrative costs.
988 Respondent’s Cost Writ, § 11.

° Claimants’ Cost Writ, | 3; Respondent’s Cost Writ, 2. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows: “(2) In
the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the
members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of

the aware

Rule 28(1) of the Arbitration Rules provides: “Without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of the proceeding,
the Tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, decide: (a) at any stage of the proceeding, the portion which each party
shall pay, pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14, of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges for
the use of the facilities of the Centre; (b) with respect to any part of the proceeding, that the related costs (as determined by the
Secretary-General) shall be borne entirely or in a particular share by one of the parties”.

Case 1:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 166 of 375

828. In exercising the power described in paragraph 827 above, the Tribunal considers that the
apportionment of costs should be made taking into consideration the relative success of the claims
and defenses of each Party, in conjunction with the circumstances of the case and the conduct of
the Parties in the proceeding. Other international arbitral tribunals have adopted similar approaches
in jointly assessing all or some of these elements.’

829. Respondent filed four objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to decide the merits of this
dispute or, at least, to rule on the expropriation claim. Although the Tribunal rejected Venezuela’s
four jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal notes that the question relating to the effects of the
denouncement of the ICSID Convention in this case involved a complex legal analysis. In the
Tribunal’s opinion, both Parties presented valid arguments to support their respective positions,
supported by the expert testimony of two recognized jurists.

830. On the merits, Claimants alleged that Venezuela breached its obligations under Articles V, IV, III
and VII of the BIT. The Tribunal found evidence of breach of there of these provisions, but not of
expropriation. Nor was it proven that the value of the Companies in the real scenario was equal to
zero, which was the assumption underlying the valuation offered by Claimants.

831. Finally, the Tribunal considers that, in general terms, both Parties presented their case in
accordance with the principles of fairness and procedural good faith. Therefore, it does not consider
it appropriate to apportion costs to one of the Parties because of .its alleged lack of diligence or
cooperation.

832. For the foregoing reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that Respondent should bear all of its
own costs. Respondent shall also bear 60% of the costs of the arbitration (namely,
USD$409,347.14 of a total of USD$682,245.24) and 60% of the legal fees and expenses incurred
by Claimants (namely, USD$5,516,358 of a total of USD$9,193,930).°” In total, the Respondent
shall pay to Claimants the sum of USD$5,925,705.14 as a contribution to the payment of their
costs in the arbitration.

833. With respect to Claimants’ request for reimbursement of costs “with interest calculated at a
reasonable commercial rate from the date of the award until the date of payment thereof’ - a
request that was included in Claimants’ Cost Brief, but not in claims of the Memorial or
Replication — the Tribunal finds that this is not duly justified and is therefore inappropriate.

VIII. DECISION
834. For the reasons given in this Award, the Tribunal unanimously decides:

(i) To reject all jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent and,
accordingly, declare that it has jurisdiction to decide this dispute.

(ii) To declare that Respondent has breached the BIT:

(a) By failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to Claimants’
investments in breach of Article IV of the BIT;

92 See, for example, Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine, § 24; Desert Line v. Yemen, 99 303-304; EDF v. Rumania, $f 327-329.
%3 This figure corresponds to the addition of the following concepts detailed in Section II of Claimants’ Cost Writ: (i) fees and
expenses of Covington & Burling LLP (USD$5,948,982); (ii) fees and expenses of Zobrist Law Group (USD$720,646); (iii)
Venezuelan lawyers’ fees and expenses (USD$152,950); (iv) experts’ fees and expenses (USD$2, 175,808), and (v) travel expenses
of Engineers Huerta and Gamiz and attorneys Vargas and Elizondo (USD$195,544).

(b) By taking arbitrary measures that hindered the management and
development of Claimants’ investments in breach of Article III of
the BIT;

(c) By preventing the free transfer of funds related to Claimants’
investments in breach of Article VII of the BIT.

(iii) To determine that such breaches have caused damages and loss of profits
to Claimants.

(iv) To order Respondent to pay to Claimants the sum of USD$430.4 million
as compensation for the damages and loss of profit caused by its breach of
the BIT.

(v) On the foregoing amount, Respondent shall pay compound interest at
Libor + 2% rate from January 22, 2013 until the date of payment to
Claimants.

(vi) To order the Respondent to refrain from imposing on the indemnity liens
or taxes similar to those already taken into account by Claimants’ experts
in their calculation thereof,

(vii) To order the Respondent to pay to Claimants the sum of
USD$5,925,705.14 as a contribution to the payment of their arbitration
costs;

(viii) To reject the other claims, requests and defenses of the Parties.
