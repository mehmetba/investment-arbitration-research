1. Article 10(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty (the “ECT”) provides:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and
create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other
Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a

discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal ...!

 

 

2. Articles 2(1), 2(2) and 2(3) of the Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the
Czech and Slovak Federal Republic on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments

signed on October 2, 1990? (the “BIT”) provides that:

Article 2

(1) Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote as far as possible investments by
investors of the other Contracting Party and admit such investments in accordance with
its legislation. Each Contracting Party shall in all cases accord investments fair and
equitable treatment. ...

(2) Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory
measures the management, maintenance, use, or enjoyment of investments in its territory
by investors of the other Contracting Party

 

(3) Investments and returns from investment and, in the event of their reinvestment, the

1 The ECT was negotiated on the basis of the European Energy Charter which envisaged the formulation of
“stable and transparent legal frameworks creating conditions for the development of energy resources”.
Title II (“Implementation”) of the European Energy Charter provided: “In order to promote the
international flow of investments, the signatories will at national level provide for a stable, transparent
legal framework for foreign investments, in conformity with the relevant international laws and rules on
investment and trade. They affirm that it is important for the signatory States to negotiate and ratify legally
binding agreements on promotion and protection of investments which ensure a high level of legal security
and enable the use of investment risk guarantee schemes.”

 

2 The BIT entered into force on August 2, 1992. By exchange of Notes of December 18, 1992 and January
1, 1993 respectively, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic have agreed that the BIT
should remain in force between the two States after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.

C. Overview of the dispute

10.

The Claimants submit that the Respondent breached its obligations under the ECT and the BIT
by repealing incentive arrangements to attract investors in photovoltaic power generation

contrary to its guarantees.

The Respondent asserts that the Tribunal is not competent to hear the claims under the ECT. It
further submits that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the claims relating to the Mozolov plant
because its operating licence was acquired “through improper means” and the HolySov plant

because the “Claimants have failed to establish a prima facie case in support of their claims

PCA Case No. 2014-01

Award

relating to that plant”. On the merits, the Respondent submits that the measures did not violate
either the ECT or the BIT on the grounds that “(a) the Czech Republic never made [a]
stabilization commitment to the Claimants, (b) the Czech Republic did not otherwise violate any
legitimate expectations, and (c) the measures were reasonably tailored to achieve appropriate and

rational state objectives.”*

IL. Procedural history

12.

On May 8, 2013, the Claimants, together with eight other claimants, served upon the Respondent
a Notice of Arbitration, with accompanying evidence’, pursuant to Article 26 of the ECT, Article
10 of the BIT and Article 3 of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law (““UNCITRAL Rules”).

In their Notice of Arbitration, the Claimants appointed Mr Doak Bishop as arbitrator.

By letter dated June 10, 2013, in response to the Notice of Arbitration, the Respondent objected
to the Claimants’ consolidation of their claims with those of the eight other claimants and

appointed Judge Tomka as arbitrator only in the proceeding involving the Claimants.

On June 24, 2013, the Claimants invited the Respondent to appoint a single arbitrator for all the

claimants listed in the Notice of Arbitration.

By letter dated July 5, 2013, the Claimants requested that the Secretary-General of the Permanent
Court of Arbitration (the “PCA”) designate an appointing authority on the grounds that the
Respondent had failed to appoint an arbitrator for all the claimants listed in the Notice of
Arbitration as required by the UNCITRAL Rules. By letter dated July 9, 2013, the Respondent
objected to the Claimants’ request, noting that “there is no single arbitration agreement in
existence that could possibly give a single arbitral tribunal authority over all the 10 claimants”.

In a letter dated July 22, 2013, the Claimants objected to the Respondent’s position.

On August 13, 2013, the Secretary-General of the PCA rejected the Claimants’ request, holding
that “the Respondent ha[d] actively participated and responded to the Notice of Arbitration [...]
in a timely manner by appointing the second arbitrator in accordance with the procedure foreseen

in each of the investment treaties invoked by the Claimants”.

By letter dated January 10, 2014, the Tribunal proposed to the Parties draft Terms of
Appointment, which included a proposed term concerning the place of arbitration, and invited

the Parties’ comments on the draft by January 17, 2014.

By letter dated January 17, 2014, the Claimants proposed that Geneva, Switzerland be the place
of arbitration, as proposed in the Notice of Arbitration dated May 8, 2013, and stated that they

would welcome the opportunity to provide “more ample reasons for their position on this point”.

By letter dated January 17,2014, the Respondent proposed that the seat of the arbitration be Paris,

France, and stated the reasons for that proposal.

The Terms of Appointment were agreed between the Parties and were adopted on January 31,
2014. Paragraph 6.1 of the Terms of Appointment provides: “[p]ursuant to Article 16 of the
Rules, the Tribunal will determine the place of arbitration having regard to the circumstances of

the case, after consultation with the Parties”.

By letter dated February 6, 2014, the Tribunal inter alia (i) invited the Claimants to confirm
whether they agreed that their Statement of Claim was contained in their Notice of Arbitration;
and (ii) proposed to decide on the place of arbitration in advance of the first procedural meeting
on the basis of written submissions and invited the Claimants to provide their further comments

on the place of arbitration.

By letter dated February 12, 2014, the Claimants confirmed that the Notice of Arbitration
included their Statement of Claim and presented their “Submission on the Seat of Arbitration” of

the same date.

By letter dated February 21, 2014, the Respondent contended that the Notice of Arbitration was
not specific enough to be treated as Statement of Claim and submitted its comments in reply to
the Claimants’ Submission on the Seat of Arbitration, in which it provided reasoning in support

of its proposal of Paris as the seat.

By letter dated March 10, 2014, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to clarify whether it intended

to object to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the grounds that such did not extend to disputes between

EU investors and EU Member States.

In the same letter, the Tribunal directed the Claimant to serve within 28 days a full Statement of
Claim including, in particular, details of (a) their investments in the Czech companies; (b) the
manner in which the alleged measures affected the investments; and (c) the financial

consequences thereof, including the quantum of their alleged losses.

By letter dated March 17, 2014, the Respondent stated that it did not intend to object to the
Tribunal’ s jurisdiction in this matter on the grounds that such does not extend to disputes between

EU investors and EU Member States.

By letter dated March 26, 2014, the Tribunal fixed The Hague, The Netherlands, as the place of

the arbitration.

On April 7, 2014, the Claimants submitted their Statement of Claim with accompanying

evidence.®

By letter dated April 17, 2014, the Tribunal directed the Respondent to submit its Statement of
Defense by June 17, 2014; directed that “the Tribunal shall conduct a procedural hearing in early
July for the future timetabling of those matters which are not agreed”; and invited the Parties to

indicate whether they agreed to these directions by April 28, 2014.

By letter dated April 23, 2014, the Respondent reserved the right to seek additional time to file
its Statement of Defense in the event that the Claimants produced the expert reports referred to

in its Statement of Claim but not annexed thereto.

On June 24, 2014, the Respondent submitted its Statement of Defense with accompanying

evidence.”

On July 11, 2014, the European Cc ission (the “EU C ission”) submitted an Appli
for Leave to Intervene as a Non-disputing party, requesting the opportunity to present its views

inter alia on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

On July 28, 2014, upon invitation by the Tribunal, each of the Parties submitted their comments.
on the Application for Leave. The Claimants requested inter alia that the Tribunal reject the

Application for Leave and that in the alternative intervention by the EU Commission be limited

to written submissions and that the EU Commission must bear its own costs and reimburse those
of the Parties. The Respondent stated that it did not oppose the EU Commission’s Application

for Leave.

On December 4, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (EC Intervention and
Place of Arbitration), granting the EU Commission leave for its amicus curie submission and
changing the place of arbitration from The Hague to Geneva. In Procedural Order No. 1, the

Tribunal ruled inter alia as follows:

(1) the European Commission is granted leave to intervene as amicus curiae (subject to the
condition in (6) below) in the present proceedings by way of one set of written
submissions only;

(2) the European Commission shall, by 19 January 2015, file its written amicus curiae
submission on the three points of law set forth in the EC Commission Application for
Leave: (i) “The Tribunal is invited to decline jurisdiction”; (ii) “As a matter of fact, the
Czech Republic, by adopting the contested measure, may have merely complied with its
obligation under European Union State Aid law”; and (iii) “The enforcement of a
possible award may amount itself to State aid, and in that case would only be possible
after an authorization by the EU Commission”

 

 

(6) the European Commission should be required to undertake, prior to consideration of its
submission, to pay in full the reasonable costs of both parties resulting from the

  

(7) the place of arbitration shall be Geneva, Switzerland.
On February 2, 2015, the EU Commission filed its written amicus curiae submission (the “EU
Commission Submission”). By letter of the date accompanying the EU Commission
Submission, the EU Commission stated that it “cannot undertake to pay in full the reasonable
costs of both Parties resulting from the submissions and would respectfully ask the Tribunal to

reconsider its decision on this point”.

By letter dated February 3, 2015, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal decline to accept the
EU Commission Submission unless the EU Commission accepted the undertaking set forth at

paragraph 30(6) of Procedural Order No. 1.

On February 13, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (EC Intervention), in which
it ruled that the EU Commission “may apply to vary Procedural Order No. 1, upon its undertaking
to pay the reasonable costs of the Parties resulting from such application if so determined by the
Tribunal” by February 27, 2015. The Tribunal did not receive any such application from the EU

Commission.

By letter dated March 5, 2015, the Tribunal informed the EU Commission that, pursuant to
paragraph 30(6) of Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal would not consider the EU Commission

Submission on the ground that the EU Commission did not undertake to pay in full the reasonable

By letter dated March 12, 2015, the Tribunal circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 3, which

included proposed procedural directions, and invited the Parties to provide their comments.

By e-mail dated March 27, 2015, the Claimants provided the Tribunal with the Parties’ joint
proposal as to the draft Procedural Order No. 3, including an agreed procedural timetable. By e-

mail of the same date, the Respondent confirmed its agreement on the proposal.

On May 22, 2015, the Claimants submitted their completed Redfern Schedule, setting out nine
document production requests to which the Respondent had objected and requesting a ruling from

the Tribunal regarding those disputed requests. On the same day, the Respondent filed its

for production hing the leted Redfern Schedule, requesting “the

Tribunal to issue an order that the Claimants produce all documents responsive to Respondent’s

requests”.
On June 9, 2015, the Tribunal issued its decision on the documents requested by the Parties.

On June 12, 2015, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to alter the existing

schedule of the proceedings.

On July 6, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (Procedural Directions), setting

forth inter alia the agreed amended schedule of further proceedings.
On October 23, 2015, the Claimants submitted their Memorial with accompanying evidence.*

By their Memorial of October 23, 2015, the Claimants requested the production of all
correspondence and documentation exchange between the European Commission (the “EU
Commission”) and the Czech Republic and waiver of the confidentiality related to the State aid
proceedings pending before the EU Commission.? The Claimants alleged that the Tribunal had
granted such a production in relation to no. 13 of the Claimants’ document request of May 22,
2015, on which the Tribunal decided that “[p]roduction ordered but limited to Solar RES” in its
order of June 9, 2015. Nevertheless, according to the Claimants, the Respondent failed to comply

PCA Case No. 2014-01

Award

By e-mail dated January 31, 2017, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had
agreed and jointly requested to submit (1) the EU Commission’s decision in case “SA.40171
(2015/NN) — Czech Republic Promotion of electricity production from renewable energy
sources” of November 28, 2016 (the “EU Commission’s 2016 Decision”) into the record of the
present cases as exhibit R-366; and (2) each Party’s written comments on the Decision. By e-

mail of the same date, the Tribunal accepted and authorized the submissions as requested.

On February 15, 2017, the Claimants submitted their Comments on the EU Commission’s 2016
Decision and accompanying documents.'? At paragraph 6 of their Comments, the Claimants
renewed their document production request of October 23, 2015, requesting that the Tribunal
order that the Respondent produce all missing documents responsive to the Claimants’ document

request no. 13 of May 22, 2015.

On the same date, the R d ibmitted its Ce on the EU Cc ission’s 2016

Decision.

By letter of March 28, 2017 the Claimants requested that they be given an opportunity to submit
an additional Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on the ground that the Respondent in its Rejoinder of
August 30, 2016 “surprisingly addressed the ECT carve-out with the aid of an opinion on Czech
law prepared by a new expert, Mr Kotab”. The Claimants further requested the exclusion of
ui report from the record pursuant to paragraph 7.8 of Procedural Order No. 3. They

further requested a leave for filing “a short ‘Supplemental Report’ on quantum.”
In letter of March 29, 2017 the Respondent raised objections to the above requests.
The Claimants addressed the Respondent’s objections in their letter of March 31, 2017.

On March 31, 2017 the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision on the Claimants’ requests.
The Tribunal denied the requests to file further pleadings, with further reports, as being too late.
However, it granted the Claimants’ request to file “the same reports on quantum and Czech tax
law as in the parallel matters”. The Tribunal further ruled that wi report would not be

excluded, but that it would take into account, in weighing its utility, that he did not appear.

On the same day the Respondent requested that it be authorized to file its own expert report

responding to the Claimants’ supplemental quantum expert report.

On April 4, 2017 the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Respondent’s request was granted.

On March 13, 2018 the Respondent made an application to the Tribunal to admit the judgment

of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Slovak Republic v Achmea BV, March 6, 2018,

into the record and to establish a schedule for its jurisdictional objection. On March 15, 2018, the

Tribunal refused the Respondent’s application on the basis that it was too late, since in its

Counter-Memorial, paragraph 472, it had waived any objection on the EU jurisdictional point,

when it stated: “Accordingly, the Czech Republic does not pursue the jurisdictional objection

articulated by the Commission before this Tribunal.”

IV. The incentive regime

A. The Act on Income Tax 586/1992

81.

In 1992, following the conclusion of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change, the Czech Republic implemented two tax incentives through Act 586/1992 (the “Act on
Income Tax”).”* Section 19( 1)(d) provided an exemption from income tax for the year in which
solar facilities were put into operation and the following five calendar years (the “Income Tax
Exemption”). Section 30, with Annex I, provided an accelerated depreciation period (between 5
to 10 years) for specific categories of electrical equipment and components for photovoltaic
installations, such as solar panels, inverters, switchboards, fuse boxes, cut-out boxes and security

camera systems (the “Shortened Depreciation Period”).”>

B. The Act on Promotion 180/2005

82.

So far as is material the Act on the Promotion of Energy Production from Renewable Energy
Sources, which was adopted on March 31, 2005 and entered into force on August 1, 2005 (the

25

“Act on Promotion’ provided that

(1) _ investors would have a connection to the grid on a preferential basis (Section 4(1));

(2) investors would have a period of 15 years for recovery of their investment through the

feed-in tariff (the “FiT”) (Section 6(1)(b)(1));

(3) the level of revenues per unit of electricity from renewable sources would be maintained,
as a minimum, with promotion by FiT, for a period of 15 years from the year of putting
the plant into operation, taking into account the price index of industrial products (Section

6(1)(b)(2));

(4) As from 2007, the FiT set by the Energy Regulatory Office (the “ERO”) for the subsequent
calendar year was not to be lower than 95% of the value of the FiT valid in the year during
which a decision was made on their new values (Section 6(4)), the effect of which was that

the FiT granted to photovoltaic plants put into operation in any given year could not be

C-18, Section 19 of Act on Income Tax.

C-18, Section 19 of Act on Income Tax. The Claimants make no claim for repeal of this advantage: Reply,
para 67. The reason is that the SPVs were financed through sale and lease back agreements with UC
g providing for a monthly rent, which accounted for depreciation and therefore excluded a direct
impact of changes to the depreciation period on the SPVs’ business: First Géde Statement, para 36.

reduced by more than 5% with respect to the FiT granted to photovoltaic plants put into

operation in the previous year (the “5% Break-Out Rule’).

The Explanatory Report on a November 2003 draft of the Bill of the Act on Promotion also stated
that the “support system is based: ... On maintaining the tax reliefs to the extent set out in the

Acts on Income Tax ...”.?”

C. ERO Regulations

84.

85.

86.

Section 4 of ERO Regulation 475/2005 (the “Technical Regulation”) provided”*

In order for the 15-year pay-back period to be assured through the support by Purchasing
Prices [FiT] of electricity produced from renewable sources, technical and economic
parameters of an installation producing electricity from renewable sources must be satisfied,
where the producer of electricity from renewable sources shall achieve, with the given level
of Purchasing Prices

(a) an adequate return on invested capital during the total life of the installation, such return
to be determined by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and

(b) the net present value of the cash flows after tax over the total life of the installation, using
a discount rate equal to WACC, at least equal to zero.

In May 2005, the ERO made available on its website its “Report on the procedure of specification
of basic parameters of the regulatory formula and price specification for the 2"! regulatory period
in the field of electrical energy.” In the section “Subsidy for Electrical Generation From
Renewables” the Report stated:””
Minimum purchase prices of electricity from individual renewable resources are specified in
relation to the amounts of investment and operation costs of the individual categories of
resources. The calculation was based on the method of net present value of the generated

project cash flows (NPV CF) for the period of the given technology life equal to zero at the
discount rate of 7%. ...

 

The weighted average cost of capital (“WACC’”) was defined by the Technical Regulation as:

. weighted average of the expected interest rate on lending for investment in projects
designed for using renewable sources for electricity generation and the expected return on
equity of an investor in a project designed for using renewable sources for electricity
generation.

The Claimants say that neither the Act on Promotion nor the subsequent implementing regulations
contained any provision on the profitability or rate of return of RES investments, and that the 7% “discount
factor” was simply one of many indicative parameters used by the ERO as a benchmark to establish the
initial level of FiT.

Award

The Technical Regulation was subsequently amended by ERO Regulations 364/2007 and
409/2009,*° which modified the technical and economic parameters and fixed the estimated

lifetime of new photovoltaic plants at 20 years.

Article 2(9) of ERO Regulation 140/2009 (the “Pricing Regulation”) provided that (1) FiTs
would be applied throughout the estimated lifetime of plants (i.e. 20 years); and (2) the FiT was
to increase each year by between 2% and 4% taking into account the inflation price index for
industrial producers throughout the lifetime of the plant. The FiT was to be set by the end of

November for the following year.

V. State aids

89.

90.

91.

92.

93.

State aid concerns over the incentive regime were raised on December 16, 2003 in a complaint
filed with the EU Commission by the Czech Society of Wind Energy and the European
Association for Renewable Energies (EUROSOLAR), alleging that the draft Act on Promotion
contravened the Czech Republic’s obligations under EU state aid law. On July 27, 2004, the EU
Commission informed the complainants that it did not consider the incentives foreseen by the
Act on Promotion to constitute State aid, but invited the Czech Republic to inform the EU

Commission of any new particulars which might demonstrate the existence of State aid.

The EU Commission did not take the matter further until the Czech Republic amended the Act
on Promotion in 2010, when the funding mechanism was changed from a consumer-funded one
to a hybrid one involving direct use of State resources. On November 18, 2011 the EU

Commission expressed the concern that the proposed amendments might constitute State aid.

On May 30, 2012 Act 165/2012 was enacted, which replaced the Act on Promotion as of January
1, 2013. On June 11, 2014 the EU Commission authorized the support scheme for electricity

produced from RES by installations commissioned as of January 1, 2013 as compatible State aid.

On December 11, 2014 the Czech Republic notified to the EU Commission, the support scheme
for electricity production from RES by installations commissioned between January 1, 2006 and

December 31, 2012.

On November 28, 2016 the EU Commission ruled that Act 180/2005 constituted State aid under

Article 107(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”), and that by

implementing Act 180/2005 on January 1, 2006, before a final EU Commission decision, the

Award

Czech Republic had breached the stand-still obligation in Article 10(3) TFEU, but that no
objection to the aid would be made because it was compatible with the internal market pursuant
to Article 107(3)(c) TFEU. But it also said (para 150):

... the Commission recalls that any compensation which the Arbitral Tribunals were to grant

would constitute in and of itself State aid. However the Arbitral Tribunals are not competent

to authorise the granting of State aid. That is an exclusive competence of the Commission. If

they were to award compensation, they would violate Article 108(3) TFEU, and any such
award would not be enforceable, as that provision is part of public order.

VI. The changes to the Incentive Regime

A. Abolition of 5% rule for plants connected to the grid from 2011

94.

95.

Act 137/2010 entered into force on May 20, 2010.7! It repealed Section 6(4) of the Act on
Promotion pursuant to which the FiT could not decrease the FiT by more than 5% per year. It

abolished the 5% rule only for those solar plants connected to the grid from 2011 onwards.

The four plants in question were constructed and commissioned after the Act came into force but

were connected to the grid before the critical date of 2011.

B. Adoption of Solar Levy

96.

97.

98.

99.

Act 402/2010 entered into force on January 1, 2011 introducing Sections 7(a)-(i) in the Act on
Promotion, establishing a levy on revenues generated by photovoltaic power plants (the “Solar
Levy”). It applied from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013 to revenues generated by
photovoltaic power plants put into operation between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010.
It was extended beyond December 31, 2013 by Act 310/2013 for photovoltaic power plants put

into operation between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2010.

The Solar Levy was originally set at 26% and 28% for payments to solar energy producers
respectively under the FiT system and under the Green Bonuses system. It was withheld by the
grid operator who paid the FiT or Green Bonuses to the RES producers for the electricity

produced.
Act 310/2013 set the Solar Levy at 10% for FiTs and 11% for Green Bonuses.

Article I(2) of Act 310/2013 also cancelled all incentives for electricity generated by solar power

plants placed into service after January 1, 2014.

Award

C. Amendment of Act on Income Tax

100. Act 346/2010, which entered into force on January 1, 2011, amended the Act on Income Tax

by repealing the Income Tax Exemption for RES producers, and the favourable depreciation
allowances. Although it was prospective, it had the effect of removing tax exemptions and

depreciation allowances which would otherwise have accrued.

D. Repeal of Act on Promotion

101.

Act 165/2012*? on Promoted Power Sources” which partly entered into force on January 1, 2013
and partly upon its publication on May 30, 2012 repealed the Act on Promotion. It left in place
the method for determining FiT and Green Bonuses, as amended at the end of 2010, for plants
put into operation before January 1, 2013, and introduced new rules for plants put into operation
thereafter. It confirmed the Solar Levy and contained several provisions which the Claimants
say negatively affected RES producers that put their plants into operation before January 1, 2013

(including the Claimants).

E. Extension of Solar Levy

102.

Act 310/2013*° was adopted on September 13, 2013, and extended the Solar Levy beyond
December 31, 2013, at a new decreased 10% rate (but only applying to 2010 PV plants and for
the entire lifetime) and 11% levy on Green Bonuses. It also imposed new obligations concerning
disclosure of major shareholders and conversion of shares only on foreign joint stock companies
producing electricity from RES. It cancelled RES support for PV plants commissioned after
January 1, 2014.

F. Subsequent developments

103.

 

On November 19, 2015, the ERO issued Price Decision 5/2015, which set the FiT applicable as
of January 1, 2016 only to plants commissioned from 2013 to 2015, but not to plants put into
operation from 2006 to 2012, thereby in effect removing the FiT. But on December 28, 2015, the
Czech Government adopted Regulation 402/2015,*° which overruled Price Decision 5/2015 and

provided that the incentives to RES plants commissioned before 2013 must be paid, pending any
decision by the EU Commission on their compliance with EU State aid law. On December 29,
2015 the ERO issued Price Decision 9/2015 setting FiT and Green Bonuses for RES plants

commissioned since 2006, including the Claimants’ plants.*”

VII. The background and history

A. Development of the incentives

104.

105.

106.

107.

40

In 1997, following the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the EU Commission released its White Paper for
Community Strategy and Action Plan, which aimed to encourage governmental measures

supportive of the development of Renewable Energy Sources (“RES”).**

On March 30, 2000, the European Parliament adopted its resolution on Electricity from
renewable energy sources and the internal electricity market, in which it, among others, requested
that the EU Commission submit a proposal of a Directive to “establish a suitable and stable legal

framework for renewable energies to underpin the rapid development of these energy sources.”*?

It was followed by the Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on
the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity
market (the “2001 Directive”), which invited Member States to “take appropriate steps to
encourage greater consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in
conformity with the national indicative target.”“° The indicative targets for the consumption of

national target for the contribution of electricity produced from RES to the gross electricity

consumption by 2010."

Following a proposal made in November 2003“ the Act on Promotion (Act 180/2005)*° was
adopted on March 31, 2005 and entered into effect on August 1, 2005.

Section 1(2) stated that the purpose of the Act was in the interest of protection of the climate and
protection of the environment, (inter alia) to promote the use of RES, and renewable energy
sources (hereinafter referred to as “renewable sources”) and create conditions for fulfilment of
the indicative target for the share of electricity from RES in the gross consumption of electricity

in the Czech Republic amounting to 8 % in 2010, and for further increase of this share after 2010.

Section 6 provided under the heading “Amounts of Prices for Electricity from Renewable Sources

and Amounts of Green Bonuses”

 

(1) The Office sets, one calendar year in advance, the purchasing prices for electricity from
Renewable Sources (the “Purchasing Prices”), separately for individual kinds of Renewable
Sources, and sets green bonuses, so that

Source, and the period of use of the facility, such parameters being stipulated in an
implementing legal regulation,

 

2. after the effective date of this Act, the amount of revenues per unit of electricity from
Renewable Sources, assuming Support in the form of Purchasing Prices, is maintained as the
minimum [amount of revenues], for a period of 15 years from the commissioning year of the

regulations to date and taking into account the industrial producer price index.

 

(2) When setting the amounts of green bonuses, the Office also takes into account a
heightened degree of risk associated with off-taking electricity from Renewable Sources in
the electricity market.

 

(3) When setting Purchasing Prices and green bonuses, the Office proceeds on the basis of
differing costs for the acquisition, connection and operation of individual types of facilities,
including the development thereof [the development of such costs] over time.

(4) Purchasing Prices set by the Office for the following calendar year shall not be less than
95% of the Purchasing Prices in effect in the year for which the setting decision is made. This
provision shall be used for the prices set for 2007.

During its passage, the Minister of Environment was quoted as describing the Act as “a step

towards a more stable environment,’“° and on June 1, 2005 Mr Martin Bursfk, former Minister

of Environment (described by the Claimants as one of the co-authors of the Act) published an

article stating that the most important principle of the law for producers was the guarantee of a

stable FiT for a 15 year period, thereby removing the risk that the ERO would reduce the FiT on

a year on year basis and that the producers’ cash flow and ability to repay loans would be

threatened.*”

Pursuant to Section 6(1)(b)(1) of the Act on Promotion, the ERO was to adopt implementing

regulations to determine the technical and economic parameters for the Incentives for each RES

technology.

These parameters were set by the Technical Regulation (ERO Regulation 475/2005).**

Section 4 of the Technical Regulation:

(1) In order for the 15-year pay-back period to be assured through the support by Purchasing
Prices of electricity produced from renewable sources, technical and economic
parameters of an installation producing electricity from renewable sources must be
satisfied, where the producer of electricity from renewable sources shall achieve, with
the given level of Purchasing Prices

a) an adequate return on invested capital during the total life of the installation,
such return to be determined by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC),
and

b) the net present value of the cash flows after tax over the total life of the
installation, using a discount rate equal to WACC, at least equal to zero.

(2) Indicative values of technical and economic parameters, separately for individual
supported categories of renewable sources and selected technologies allowing to meet
the required economic criteria under subsection (1) in electricity production from
renewable sources, are listed in Annex No. 3 hereto.*°

 

Annex 3 of the Technical Regulation proceeded on the basis that photovoltaic power plants had
an expected lifetime of 15 years. It was amended by ERO Regulation 364/2007 which increased

the expected lifetime to 20 years.

In the 2005 Fourth National Communication of the Czech Republic on the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change (the “2005 UN Report”), the Czech Republic described the

purpose of Section 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on Promotion as:*”

providing guarantees to the investors and owners of installations, producing electricity from
renewable sources who are subject to support pursuant to the Act, that the amount of revenue
per unit of produced electricity from renewable sources acquired by the producers from the
support will be maintained for a period of 15 years from bringing the installation into
operation (or for a period of 15 years for installations that were brought into operation prior
to the date of effect of the Act)

In accordance with Articles 4 and 8 of the 2001 Directive, on December 7, 2005 the EU
Commission issued a Communication addressing the progress made by each Member State in

achieving the targets, and suggesting a way forward.*! The Commission said:

Member States shall optimize and fine tune their support schemes by:

Increasing legislative stability and reducing investment risk. One of the main concerns
with national support schemes is any stop-and-go nature of a system. Any instability in the
system creates high investment risks, normally taking the form of higher costs for consumers.
Thus, the system needs to be regarded as stable and reliable by the market participants in the
long run in order to reduce the perceived risks. Reducing investment risk and increasing

ity i issue, notably in the green certificate market. The design of a support
mechanism must minimise unnecessary market risk. Increased liquidity could improve the
option of long term contracts and will give a clearer market price.*.

 

 

 

   

 

In this period the Czech Government promoted the scheme abroad.**

On April 23, 2009 the European Parliament and the Council of the EU adopted Directive
2009/28/EC (the “2009 Directive”), which repealed the 2001 Directive and fixed new mandatory
targets for the contribution of electricity produced from RES by 2020. The Czech Republic’s new

target was set at 13% by 2020 (Annex I, Part A). The Recitals to the 2009 Directive emphasized
(paras 14 and 25) that the main purpose of mandatory national targets was to provide certainty
for investors and that Member States had to guarantee national support schemes to maintain

investor confidence.

On May 11, 2009 the ERO adopted the Pricing Regulation (ERO 140/2009), Article 2(9) of which

provided as follows:

Feed-in tariffs and Green bonu: tipulated by the Act on Promotion are applied throughout
the estimated lifetime of plants determined by the regulation implementing some provisions
of the Act on Promotion. The Feed-in tariffs increase annually throughout the lifetime of the
plant classified in the respective category depending on the type of the renewable resource
used and the date of launch into operation with respect to the industrial producers’ price index
by a minimum of 2% and maximum of 4%, with the exception of biomass and bio gas burning
plants.

120.

123.

Initially investment in solar power was not especially attractive because of the relatively high
price of PV panels and the relatively poor irradiation profile of the Czech Republic. No significant
volume of PV plants was installed prior to 2009.*‘ The significant drop in the price of PV panels
began in 2008 and accelerated in 2009. In early 2009 the ERO learned that the electricity
transmission and distribution companies began receiving a significantly increasing number of
preliminary applications for connection to the grid for solar installations. It took the view that an
uncontrolled increase in solar energy would be highly undesirable because (1) it would increase
the price of RES support paid by consumers; (2) it would lead to significantly higher profits for
solar investors compared with other RES producers; and (3) it would threaten the stability of the

grid because of the unpredictable and volatile nature of solar electricity production.**

On January 29, 2009 Mr Fiit, the then Chairman of the ERO, alerted the Prime Minister to these

problems and to the need to amend the Act on Promotion to remove the 5% cap.*°

On March 1, 2009 the European Photovoltaic Industry Association published a study predicting

8% annual decrease in PV system prices for 2009, and a halving of costs every 8 years.*”

The ERO Report on the Fulfilment of the Indicative Target for Electricity Production from

Renewable Energy Sources for 2008 (prepared in 2009) said that in a year-on-year comparison,

2007/2008 recorded an almost ten-fold rise in installed capacity of PV systems in the Czech
Republic, which had been caused in particular by a fall in the prices of photovoltaic panels by

over 40% and the retention of very favourable prices. It went on:

But it recognized that the Act on Promotion brought a guarantee of long-term and stable
promotion necessary for decision-making by businesses, a guarantee of revenues per unit of
electricity produced for a period of 15 years from the date it is put into operation, and retention
of the level of purchase prices for equipment already in operation for a period of 15 years, and a

maximum year-on-year fall in purchase prices of electricity for new equipment of 5%.”

The Prime Minister told Mr Fiit that he would take steps to amend the Act on Promotion in
accordance with Mr Fiit’s recommendation,” but following a vote of censure, in March 2009 the
Government had to resign and elections were fixed for October 2009 (postponed by decision of
Constitutional Court on September 10, 2009 to May 2010). In May 2009 the Fischer caretaker

government was formed.

According to Mr Fiit, in mid-2009 many banks temporarily suspended the financing of new solar

installations, anticipating a possible change in legislation.*!

On July 1, 2009 Mr Fiit wrote to the Minister of Industry and Trade and to the Minister of
Environment pointing to the “fairly dramatic” rise in preliminary connection requests for
photovoltaic installations and urging the Government to abolish the 5% Break-Out Rule so that
the ERO could reduce the incentives for investments made in 2010.” The letter said:

Jam writing to you with an urgent request concerning Act No. 180/2005 Coll., on promotion

of production of power generated from renewable energy sources.

The Energy Regulatory Office is responsible for promotion of power generated from
renewable energy sources under the law. The situation with regard to requests for connecting
new sources to the grid (primarily photovoltaic plants) is currently fairly dramatic. The
growth in installed capacity for photovoltaic plants between 2007 and 2008 amounted to
nearly 1,500% (starting at 3.4 MW and finishing at 54.29 MW). The installed capacity hit 77
MW at the end of June this year. Regional distribution system operators predict that at least

another 250 MW will be connected and put into operation by the end of 2009.

At the same time, photovoltaic plants have seen a sharp decline in specific investment costs
by approx. 30%. However, the Energy Regulatory Office cannot respond to this situation
with the appropriate decrease in the feed-in tariff for power generated from these sources,
which puts investors in this area at an unprecedented advantage over investors and producers
of other types of renewable resource:

 

 

This situation also leads to a speculative block of connection capacities at the level of the
distribution systems. For this reason it is no longer possible to grant a request for connection
for any applicant in a large part of the Czech Republic for the foreseeable future. This applies
not only to renewable resources, but also to sources for combined power and heat production.

 

The provisions of Section 6(4) need to be amended, because at present they are making it
impossible for the Energy Regulatory Office to lower the feed-in tariff on power from
renewable resources by more than 5% year-on-year.

I would also like to stress the financial and social aspect of this problem, since the current
uncontrollable growth in photovoltaic plants already means that all customers in the Czech
Republic, including households, will be making a contribution of more than CZK 3 billion
in 2010 just for new photovoltaic plants, while the total fund for promoting all types of
renewable resources for 2008 was CZK 2.658 billion. In simplified terms, all customers in
the Czech Republic will pay about CZK 50/MWh more for power just due to the growth in
photovoltaics.

For the reasons stated above, the Energy Regulatory Office proposes that Section 6(4) of Act
No. 180/2005 Coll. should be repealed. This will make it possible to adjust the feed-in tariff
for photovoltaics to match the actual situation.

In my opinion the issue described in this letter is extremely serious. I am also sending this
letter to the Minister for the Environment as the co-sponsor of Act No. 180/2005 Coll. I will
be happy to meet in person to discuss the ie, if needed.

 
 

 

On July 22, 2009 the Minister of Environment replied to Mr Fiit to agree that the current market
situation was unsustainable and that it was necessary to decrease a disproportionate economic
profit of large-scale outdoor photovoltaic systems which these installations currently had
compared to other renewable sources. But he disagreed with the proposal to amend Section 6(4)

of the Act on Promotion, because it was necessary to preserve the trust of investors. °

On July 29, 2009, the Minister of Industry and Trade replied to Mr Fiit stating that the

Government would “indeed make efforts to amend [Section 6(4)] as soon as possible.”®*

On August 10, 2009 the ERO’s Vice Chairman, Mr Némeéek, wrote to the Acting Director of
the Electric Power Department in the Ministry of Industry and Trade calling for the repeal of
Section 6(4) to “make it possible to adjust the purchase price for photovoltaics to match the actual

part of the state has ceased to fulfil its primary function, because support for solar power stations
has shifted from an area of necessary state support for its existence to the position of a branch
where profit is guaranteed regardless of the situation on the market,” that it was “planning to
change the maximum 5% limit by which the ERO can reduce the purchase price of electricity
from renewable energy sources annually” and that it was “trying to ensure that the new act comes

into force on | January next year.”® The press release read:

Ministry of Industry and Trade equalises support for renewable energy sources

The Ministry of Industry and Trade is preparing an amendment to Act No 180/2005 Coll.,
concerning support for electricity generation from renewable energy sources. The Ministry
of Industry and Trade is planning to change the maximum 5% limit by which the Energy
Regulation Office can reduce the purchase price of electricity from renewable energy sources
annually. The system for support of renewable energy sources must guarantee a fair
competition environment for all renewable sources, it must respect the realistic technical—
economic parameters of the individual types of RES, and it must also ensure a commensurate
attractiveness for investors. The Ministry of Industry and Trade is trying to ensure that the
new act comes into force on | January next year.

 

  

 

The reason for the amendment of the act is primarily the situation in the area of photovoltaic
devices, where the grant policy from the part of the state has ceased to fulfil its primary
function, because support for solar power
support for its existence to the position of a branch where profit is guaranteed regardless of
the situation on the market.

 

Between the years 2007 and 2008 the installed capacity of solar power stations grew by
almost 1500 % from an original 3.4 MW to 54.29 MW. By the end of June this year the
installed capacity had risen to 80 MW.

The ongoing reduction in the prices of photovoltaic panels is leading to the uncontrolled
development of solar power stations. Whereas technological advances have reduced the price
of photovoltaic panels by more than 40%, by law the Energy Regulation Office can only
reduced the purchase price of electricity for new renewable sources by 5% per year. So at
present a significant advantage is being provided to newly built photovoltaic power stations
compared to other sources of renewable energy.

Given the current parameters, customers in the Czech Republic, including households, will
contribute more than CZK 3 billion in support of electricity generation from new photovoltaic
sources alone in 2010. If the law were to remain unchanged, in the years to come the
contribution for photovoltaic devices would rise dramatically.

 

Put simply, if the current state were maintained the price for the delivery of electricity would
rise by more than CZK 50/MWh for all customers in the Czech Republic just as a result of
increase in photovoltaic devices. In 2011 the price for customers would be even higher.

The purchase prices for electricity from photovoltaic devices are guaranteed for 15 years, but
thanks to new technology in certain cases the return on the investment is a mere 5 years. The
level of the purchase price for electricity from a photovoltaic device is almost CZK 13/kWh,
whereas the market price for electricity is around CZK 2/kWh.

On August 28, 2009, the Acting Director of the Department in the Ministry of Industry and Trade
wrote, in reply to Mr Némeéek’s letter of August 10, 2009:

1... believe that the preferential treatment of investors and potentially adverse impact on the
regulated part of electricity price mentioned by you are hardly sustainable in the future.

On the other hand, it is appropriate to realize that the goal of section 6(4) ... was to ensure
the investors in renewable sources certainty of payback of their investments, transparency
and predictability. A simple cancellation could thus entail a risk of suits filed by investors
against the Czech Republic on grounds of lost investments.*”

  

On September 8, 2009 in an open letter to the Chairman of the Economic Committee of the
Chamber of Deputies Mr Fiit again proposed an amendment to the Act on Promotion to enable
the ERO to lower the incentives, subject to ensuring “‘a reasonable vacatio legis period” whereby
the change would take effect only from 2011, so that “Investors will be able to prepare
sufficiently in advance for the change in the conditions for investing which should eliminate
entirely the risk of possible lawsuits in the Czech Republic regarding protection of

investments.”

ERO made presentations dealing with the solar boom issue. In an October 2009 presentation,
ERO said that “the economic return [for solar investors] at the current prices is in conflict with
the guaranteed return pursuant to the law and is almost half [of the original 15-year period].”
ERO drew attention to the technical parameters specified in the Technical Regulation and
explained that an appropriate drop in the 2010 FiT to reflect cost developments would amount to

29.5%.

In November 2009, the ERO adopted Regulation 409/2009, which modified the technical and

0

economic parameters of the Technical Regulation.”” The expected lifetime for photovoltaic

plants was kept as 20 years, as set out in Regulation 364/2007.

In the same month, the ERO issued its Report, in which it said that “the construction of installed
capacity in biomass (around 352 MW), wind (around 269 MW), photovoltaics (around 131 MW)
and biogas (around 70 MW) [was] of key importance for the fulfilment of the [8%] indicative
target [for 2010].””"

On November 16, 2009 the Government put forward a proposal to amend Act 180/2005.”” The
Explanatory Report says that the aims of the legislation were to adjust the prices for solar power
as of January 1, 2011, to eliminate the current discrimination against other types of renewable
sources and repeating Mr Fiit’s formula about investors preparing in advance so as to eliminate

the risk of potential lawsuits against the Czech Republic.

During a press conference on the same day,” the Minister of Industry and Trade, Mr Vladimir
ToSovsky, said that reduction of the promotion from 2011 was chosen to avoid changing the

terms and conditions under which existing investors had invested.

plants.”

The Tribunal was referred to many published articles from June 2009 onwards recording that the

S

Government wanted to end the boom,”* and reporting opposition to its plans.”°

In this period there was a geometric increase in installed solar capacity, as many investors (most
of them domestic rather than foreign) took advantage, according to Mr Fiit, of what was widely

perceived as an opportunity to earn very high profits.”

As a result of the rise in the number of applications to connect new solar installations, from
February 2010 the national transmission system operator and the regional distribution system
operators started to limit the issuance of “binding statements”, i.e. the preliminary agreements
which assured investors that their plants would be connected to the grid upon completion. The

national moratorium on new applications was widely announced and reported.”

On March 12, 2010 the three regional distribution companies wrote an open letter to Parliament
urging it to adopt the amendment to the Act on Promotion to curtail “excessive profits” of solar

generators.”

On March 17, 2010 the Chamber of Deputies approved Act 137/2010, which entered into force
on May 20, 2010.*° This measure abolished the 5% rule for plants connected to the grid from
January 1, 2011 onwards (Article II).

The Czech Republic published its 2010 National Renewable Energy Action Plan in July 2010
(the “2010 Action Plan”).*! It stated that, in relation to solar plants, the “fixed tariffs” (including
the FiT set for 2010) were guaranteed for a period of 20 years and that there was no cap “on the
total volume of electricity produced per year or of installed capacity that is entitled to the tariff”.
In the 2010 Action Plan, the Income Tax Exemption was listed together with the FiT and Green

Bonuses as available financial support for RES.**

In July 2010 the Necas Government was sworn in, following elections in May 2010, and held

office until July 2013.

There was a series of newspaper articles between July and September 2010 suggesting that the

Government might resort to taxation measures to deal with the solar boom.*

support for large solar plants commissioned on or after March 1, 2011.** The Explanatory Report

stated:

It is a legislative change of claim for the support of production of electricity from renewable
energy sources. Photovoltaic power plants already connected to the electric power system
will have their right to claim support preserved under existing conditions. Facilities not yet
connected to the electric power system but which started operation before January 1, 2011
will have 12 months to be connected to the electric power system. If they do so, then their
right to claim support will be preserved. The extent of support will correspond to the
guaranteed support for the respective facility as of the time of its connection to the electric
power system.

It is proposed that this Bill comes into effect from January 1, 2011. From March 1, 2011 the
only supported facilities will be photovoltaic power plants with the installed power output of
less than 30 kWp that are located on roofs and constructions of buildings. To this date it is
also guaranteed that photovoltaic power plants already connected to the electric power system

will have their right to claim support preserved under existing conditions”.*°

   

On September 22, 2010 the Czech Government instructed the Ministers of Industry and Trade
and of Environment to form a Coordination Committee to evaluate the impact of support for RES

on electricity and energy prices.*”

The Committee’s tasks** included the preparation of specific analyses on the impact of RES

support on prices and the preparation of a draft amendment to the Act on Promotion.

On October 13, 2010 a draft of legislation to amend the Act on Promotion was re-submitted.*”
The draft maintained support under existing legal regulations for sources commissioned prior to

the effective date of the Act and connected to the grid by December 31, 2011 (Article II).

On October 13, 2010 (as the Deputy Industry and Trade Minister reported to the Coordination
Committee on October 15, 2010) the Government approved proposals to reduce the impact of
RES on the price of electricity by a combination of three solutions, namely: (1) “The introduction
of a withholding tax on sales of electricity from photovoltaic power plants”; (2) “Change of rates

for alienation of land from the agricultural land fund”; and (3) “Include the revenues from the

sale of emission permits, including derogative, in the financing of RES Support””’. The first

solution eventually became the Solar Levy.

First Deputy Environmental Minister Bizkova is recorded as having said:

... It is necessary to find a formally correct mechanism for reduction of the support of RES
from photovoltaic power plants, such that it cannot be legally contested.

and Mr J Fiit was noted as declaring that the ERO fully supported “the legally strong variant,
which shall ensure the reduction of the contribution to the PVPPs [photovoltaic

power producers].””!

On October 20, 2010, the Government resolved to approve the introduction of “the levy on
production of electricity from solar radiation from the facilities put into operation in 2009 and

2010."

At a meeting on October 20, 2010, the Minister of Finance explained the Solar Levy as follows:

Mechanism to reduce the surge increase of the prices of electricity consists in translation of
support for RES to the prices for the final consumers only to a limited extent. The
Government shall provide the operators of the transmi n and distribution system (grid
operators) with additional funding to cover the increase of the contribution to RES. ...

   

For the operators of the systems, the price shall be compensated from the state budget ....

 

The necessary securing of budget resources on the part of the state budget is realised by
increase of the revenues from the title of adoption of three measures:

1. Increasing the levy from removal of land from the Agricultural Land Fund ...;

2. The introduction of a levy on the production of electricity from solar radiation from plants
commissioned into service in 2009 and 2010 ...;

3. The introduction of gift tax on emission allowances ...°°
On October 26, 2010 the Government introduced a draft of Act 346/2010 amending the Act on
Income Tax by repealing the Income Tax Exemption and abolishing the Shortened Depreciation

Period as from January 1, 2011.

support of electric power generation from renewable resources (mainly solar power plants)
that is no longer justified ...Taxpayers will be able to take advantage of this tax relief for the
last time for the tax period that began in 2010. This means among other things that the change
will also apply to taxpayers who put environmentally friendly power plants and facilities in
operation before this amendment took effect.

   

This proposed effectiveness date [January 1, 2011] does not create a risk of true retroactivity,
since it is not a revision of legal relationships that had already arisen, but is an adjustment of
relationships for the future ...°°

At the session of October 29, 2010 the bill to amend the Act on Promotion was assigned to the

Economic Committee of the Chamber of Deputies for review.

On November 2, 2010 a new draft was submitted to Parliament, introducing the Solar Levy (for

3 years).°°

In debate before the Economic Committee on November 2, 2010 the Government was asked
whether the Ministry of Industry and Trade was not afraid of losing arbitrations, and the answer
was that tax regimes were a matter for each country, and changes in tax rates should not be

challenged in arbitration. The Minister of Industry and Trade, Mr Kocourek, said:

The issue of arbitrations in general is absolutely erratic. ... I declare that it will reduce the
amount of intended support to make it bearable for the Czech Republic and for electricity
consumers in the Czech Republic. This method — through the withholding tax — it is not just
a retroactive correction of support. One may argue as to whether or not thi retroactive.
Nevertheless, it is a similar situation as if you changed the conditions for investors by
increasing the income tax. From the arbitration perspective, they will strive to advocate the
principle on which the support for RES has been based, i.e. their 15-year payback period ...
the rest is the question of tax regimes — this is the responsibility of each country, and changes
in tax rates should not be challenged in arbitrations.”

 

       

On November 8, 2010, the ERO issued Price Decision 2/2010, in which it set the FiTs for 2011
plants. The FiTs for plants with capacity of over 30kW commissioned in 2011 were set at lower

than 50% of those for plants commissioned in 2010.

On November 12, 2010 the Czech Parliament approved Act 346/2010, which entered into force

on January 1, 2011.

In this period, according to Mr Minéicé, who was then the First Deputy Minister of
Finance, investors rushed in to obtain the high FiTs, which had the effect of accelerating the boom
in new solar installations, with the result that there would be electricity price increases of 12.7%

for households and 18.4% for industrial consumers. '°

In the debate on the amendment to the Act on Promotion on November 29, 2010 the First Deputy
Minister of Finance, Mr Minéié said that the solar boom might or would trigger an increase in
electricity prices for business by 17% or more, and such an abrupt increase would almost liquidate
a significant proportion of Czech industry. He also discussed the legal issues, including
constitutional challenges based on the “quasi-retroactivity” of the Act, issues relating to the
principle of legitimate expectations under EU law, and to undertakings which result from treaties

protecting and supporting foreign investments. He accepted that there was a risk of arbitrations.’

The Minister of Industry and Trade made similar points at the Senate session of December 8,
2010.'? The Minister acknowledged the risk of investment arbitrations brought by aggrieved
solar investors against the State, but referred to an opinion by a law firm, Advokatni kancelat
Kiiz a Bélina, which “concluded that from the general perspective, the Czech Republic should

be able to defend the proposed solutions.””'°>

In the debate Senator Jiti Cunek criticized the Government officials who failed to monitor the

development of the solar market and said:

 

However, what does our law say? Our law says that this is false retroactivity, that
international arbitrations cannot be excluded in view of claims regarding the protection of
investments, and that the taxation of emissions credits legally contestable, since the
decision of the state body is not a gift and is inconsistent with EU law. That means that we
are in a very unconventional situation.

 

  
 

 

Senator Cunek also endorsed a proposal by the President of the Czech Republic to limit the Solar
Levy to one year, so as to avoid payment of damages. As an alternative he proposed to raise funds
for RES support by introducing a tax on the production of nuclear energy, as done in Germany.'“
In his opinion, that solution would have been consistent with the promotion of RES and would

not have caused legal problems.

The Chairman of the Economic Committee, Senator Jan Hajda, warned about the likelihood of

arbitrations and said that the only honourable course would be to reject the bill.!°°

After the discussion, the Senate refused to approve the bill and none of the amendments proposed
at the discussion were adopted. But Act 402/2010'° passed on December 14, 2010, in accordance
with Article 46(3) of the Czech Constitution pursuant to which a bill is considered adopted if the

Senate takes no action within 30 days of its submission.

Sections 7(a)-(i) introduced the Solar Levy, which applied to power generated by solar radiation
from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013 ina plant put into operation between January 1, 2009
and December 31, 2010. The levy rate was 26% on FiTs and 28% on Green Bonuses.

According to the Respondent, the levy rate of 26% was calculated in order to ensure that investors
continued to have a guarantee of return of investment within 15 years and a return on capital of

at least 7% per annum on average over the lifetime of their investment.'””

Act 330/2010, which came into force on January 1, 2011 amended Section 3(5) of the Act on
Promotion and abolished all incentives related to photovoltaic plants with installed output

exceeding 30 kWp commissioned after March 1, 2011.

On January 11, 2011 the European Commissioners for Energy and Climate Action expressed

“serious concerns” about the retroactive character of the amendment to the Act on Promotion.'“*

Act 165/2012' repealed the Act on Promotion as of January 1, 2013. The Act established a new
funding mechanism under which, inter alia, the Czech Electricity and Gas Market Operator
(OTE) paid (i) Green Bonuses directly to the RES producers; and (ii) the difference between the
FiT and the market price to the “mandatory purchasers”. The Act also introduced the “negative
hourly price”, which was designed to be paid to the “mandatory purchasers” by RES operators
entitled to the FiT or to be deducted from the payable FIT by the “mandatory purchasers” when
the price of electricity on the daily market had a negative value. Pursuant to the transitional

A. Whether the Solar Levy is a tax for the purposes of Energy Charter Treaty, Art 21(1)

1. The Respondent’s position

175. The Respondent contends that “[t]he Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over Claimants’ [ECT]
claims that pertain to taxation” by reason of Article 21 of the ECT, which excludes “Taxation

Measures” from the scope of the ECT.'!°

176. Article 21 of the ECT provides, in relevant part:

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or
impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the
event of any inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the Treaty,
this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

Le]

(2) Article 10(2) and (7) [Most favourable and national treatment] shall apply to Taxation
Measures of the Contracting Parties other than those on income or on capital.

Le]

(5) (a) Article 13 [Expropriation] shall apply to taxes.

Le]

(7) For the purposes of this Article: (a) The term “Taxation Measures” includes: (i) any
provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a political
subdivision thereof or a local authority therein; and (ii) any provision relating to taxes
of any convention for the avoidance of double taxation or of any other international
agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound. [...]!

 

177. According to the Respondent, all of the Respondent’s amendments to the Incentive Regime, i.e.,
the installation and the extension of the Solar Levy and the repeals of the Tax Exemption and the
Shortened Depreciation Period constituted taxation measures for the purpose of Article 21(1) of
the ECT.'? The Respondent notes that the Claimants do not object to the tax measure
applicability as to the repeals of the Tax Exemption and the Shortened Depreciation Period.'"?

Accordingly, the tax carve-out becomes at issue only in relation to the introduction and the

prolongation of the Solar Levy.’

The Respondent asserts that the determination of whether a measure is characterized as a Tax
Measure should be based on the plain text of Article 21(7) of the ECT and in accordance with
the VCLT.''° Article 31 VCLT provides, inter alia, that “[a] special meaning shall be given to
aterm if it is established that the parties so intended”.'"® The Respondent then submits that under
Article 21(7)(a) the contracting State Parties intended to give a special meaning to the term
“Taxation Measures” by defining them as including “any provision relating to taxes of the

wli7

domestic law of the Czech Republic. Accordingly, any provision relating to tax measures

under domestic law is carved-out pursuant to Article 21(7) of the ECT.! 18

According to the Respondent, such a reference to domestic law is consistent with arbitral practice
where “tribunals have not hesitated to apply domestic law when expressly instructed to do so.”!!”
This is also supported by the drafters’ intent to “preserve State autonomy over taxation matters,

rather than wrest it from the State’s hands”.'”°

The Respondent objects to the Claimants’
assertion that this interpretation allows a host State to evade an ECT obligation by categorizing
its measure as tax, noting that the ultimate authority to decide the tax applicability belongs to a
tribunal, instead of a host State.'?! The Respondent also objects to the Claimants’ allegation that
the reference to domestic law is contrary to the purpose of the ECT, stating that they do not

provide an adequate explanation. '”

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ argument that taxes must be “imposed in good faith” in
order for the Article 21 carve-out to apply.'?>_ The Respondent notes that the Energy Charter
Secretariat’s 2015 publication on “Taxation of Foreign Investments under International Law”—

to which the Claimants refer—does not indicate that any such requirement applies.'** The

passage cited by the Claimants for support discusses various merits issues relating to a State’s
power to tax which the Respondent deems inappropriate for the determination of whether there

is jurisdiction over the dispute. '?°

In any event, the Respondent submits that the Claimants’ allegation that the Respondent
deliberately camouflaged the Solar Levy as a tax in order to evade international liability under
the treaties, and thus, acted in bad faith, is without merit.!° The Respondent contends that, as
found by the tribunal in Tza Yap Shum v. Peru, the conduct of tax authorities ought to be
examined “under an assumption of good faith”.'2” According to the Respondent, the Claimants
should have, but failed, to provide evidence to overcome this presumption by showing that the

purpose of the introduction of the Solar Levy was one “‘entirely unrelated’ to taxation, ‘such as
the destruction of a company or the elimination of a political opponent’.””'?* Furthermore, several
tribunals have ruled that a State cannot be deemed to have acted in bad faith simply because it
did not pursue what a tribunal (in hindsight) believes would have been a better way of

accomplishing an objective.!””

The Respondent maintains that the Solar Levy can meet the definition adopted in Yukos v. Russia,
in which the tribunal defined taxation measures as “actions that are motivated by the purpose of
raising general revenue for the State”.!*° This is primarily based upon the Respondent’ s expert's
analysis that “there is no obligation for the Government to use the funds that it receives pursuant
to the Solar Levy to finance any specific purpose.”!*! The Respondent adds that its good faith is
supported by the fact that it was looking for a lawful measure under domestic law, instead of

simply reducing the FiT.'*?

The Respondent invokes the fact that the Solar Levy applied to all solar producers whose plants
were put into operation in 2009 and 2010, irrespective of whether the solar producer could invoke
an investment treaty or of whether that investment treaty contained a tax-carve out." The
Respondent rejects the Claimants’ argument that the Tribunal read “bad faith” into the Deputy
Environment Minister’s contention that it was “necessary to find a formally correct mechanism
for reduction of the support of RES from photovoltaic power plants, such that it cannot be legally
contested” noting that it is the “essence of good faith” to find a lawful way to achieve a policy

objective.'™

The Respondent describes that it did not choose to reduce the FiT because such a FiT reduction
would have been (1) “[i]nsufficient by itself to compensate all budget support costs (unless FIT
reduced by 50%); (2) “[lJess suited to addressing temporary problem affecting only some
producers of one source of RES”; (3) “[i]mpossible to implement before year-end (given need to
amend multiple levels of laws/regulations)”; and (4) “[r]equire more radical revision of RES

support framework”.'35

The Respondent contends that the Solar Levy is a tax under Czech domestic law.

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal must determine whether the amendment measures
constituted taxes under domestic law “in accordance to evidence presented to it as to the content
of the law and the manner in which the law would be understood and applied by the municipal

courts” !3°

and there is “overwhelming evidence” that the Czech legal system overall treats the
Solar Levy as a tax, and the Solar Levy has been “understood and applied” as such by the Czech

municipal courts.'°7

The Respondent notes that, like any tax, the Solar Levy has a rate, a base, and a taxpayer.'**
Therefore, the Czech legislator has provided for its collection by the tax authorities as revenue

for the general State budget.'*°

The Respondent asserts that “the Czech legislation specifically designates the Solar Levy as a
tax”.'“° The Solar Levy meets the definition of “tax” under the Tax Administration Law, a central
instrument of Czech tax law, and is accounted for and reported as a tax in accordance with Czech
accounting law and budgetary procedure, and listed as a tax in the reports of international
organizations that use their own autonomous definitions of tax (OECD and Eurostat).!4!_ The
Respondent submits that the Solar Levy has never been classified as anything other than a tax in

142

accounting legislation. "“~ Indeed, the Respondent emphasizes that the Claimants’ own financial

statements also describe the Solar Levy as a “solar tax”.'45

The Respondent states that nothing in the ECT suggests that Article 21 only refers to taxes in a
“narrow” or “theoretical” sense; on the contrary, the Energy Charter Secretariat’s publication on
Article 21 indicates that the ECT “envisaged all kinds of special domestic taxes, including taxes
to reduce excessive profits”.'* Furthermore, there is no provision of the ECT requiring that

provisions be provisions “relating to taxes of domestic law”.'* In the Respondent's view, the
relationship between the Solar Levy and the Czech domestic tax system is direct and unequivocal,
given that (1) the Solar Levy is directly transferred to the general State budget; (2) the Solar Levy

does not impact gross revenues; and (3) the accounting practice categorizes the Solar Levy as a

tax expense. '“7

The Respondent notes further that the Czech judiciary overwhelming refers to the Solar Levy as
atax.'“8 The Czech Constitutional Court unequivocally refers to the Solar Levy as “a tax or fee”
for the purposes of Article 11(5) of the Czech Republic’s Charter of Fundamental Rights and
Freedoms and satisfies the provision’s requirement that “taxes and fees should be levied only on
the basis of the law”.'*° On the other hand, the Czech Supreme Administrative Court decision of
July 10, 2014, on which the Claimants rely, is unpersuasive given that (1) the issue of non-
equivalence had never been argued during the proceedings; (2) no other Czech court or scholar

have cited this decision; and (3) no oral hearing was held and only two briefs were submitted.'*°

The Respondent addresses the six features of taxation proposed by the Claimants: “(a) obligatory,
(b) non-refundable and (c) non-equivalent payment (d) introduced by law, (e) intended to serve
as income of the state budget for the financing of society-wide needs and (f) paid for no specific
purpose.”!*! According to the Respondent, contrary to the Claimants’ statements, the Solar Levy
is “non-equivalent” and was not “paid for a specific purpose” since the proceeds are deposited
into the general treasury account of the Ministry of Finance and serve to finance general

government liabilities.

Respondent, the Solar Levy meets the requirement that “there is a law, which imposes a liability
on classes of persons to pay money to the State for public purposes”, as expressed by several
tribunals including EnCana v. Ecuador, Burlington v. Ecuador, and Duke Energy Electroquil v.

Ecuador.'**

The Respondent also contends that, considering that French and Italian versions of the ECT
employ the term of “fiscal measures”, instead of “taxation measures”, the scope of carve-out may
go beyond taxation measures and include any fiscal measures.'*° In this context, the Respondent
submits that the Czech Constitutional Court decision of May 15, 2012 and the Supreme
Administrative Court decision of July 9, 2015 have confirmed the Solar Levy as a fiscal
measure.'°° The Respondent further submits that the Claimants also confirmed it in stating that

rules are contained in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “VCLT”), and notable

in Article 31(1), which provides:

The Claimants find support for the importance of the “good faith” principle, “context” and
“object and purpose” in treaty interpretation in the commentary of the International Law

Commission, the writings of several authors and decisions of arbitral tribunals. 161

Under these criteria, the tax carve-out in Article 21(1) ECT should not exclusively depend on a
host State’s domestic tax legislation, because such an interpretation enables the host State to
evade international liability by arbitrary categorizing its measure as tax.'? Rather, the good faith
interpretation requires taxation measures to be legitimate or bona fide in order for the tax carve-

3

out to apply.'®? The Energy Charter Secretariat’s own publication on Article 21 could not be

more clear about the standard for what constitutes legitimate taxation as follows:

 

hi
shall te imposed in good faith. Taxation me: ‘s shall not be confiscat[ory], prevent, or
unreasonably interfere with, nor unduly delay effective enjoyment of a foreign investor’s
property or its removal from the State’s territory. '

The Claimants note that the tribunal in Yukos confirmed this interpretation concluding that good

faith is required in order for Article 21 to apply:

1430. [...] the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction to rule on Claimants’ claims under
Article 13 of the ECT due to the fact that the Article 21 carve-out does not apply to the

Russian Federation’s measures because they are not, as the Tribunal has concluded above,
on the whole, a bona fide exercise of the Russia

   

1431. This accords with Claimants’ view that Article 21 of the ECT can apply only to

bona fide taxation actions, i.e., actions that are motivated for the purpose of raising
general revenue for the State. By contrast, actions that are taken only ‘under the guise’ of

 

 

taxation, but in reality aim to achieve an entirely unrelated purpose [...] cannot qualify for
exemption from the protection standards of the ECT under the taxation carve-out in Article
Dyn

The Claimants thus aver that both case law and good treaty interpretation mandate that in order
for the Article 21(1) ECT tax carve-out to apply, taxes must be imposed in good faith. Referring

to the 2014 Yukos awards, the Claimants note that the ECT tax carve-out mandates that the State’s

manner as was pronounced by the Quasar v. Russia tribunal, which noted that, absent such a

standard, “international law would likely become an illusion, as states would quickly learn to
avoid responsibility by dressing up all adverse measures [...] as taxation”.'°7

In the present case, the Claimants allege that the Solar Levy is not a bona fide taxation measure

under the Yukos standard. '°

The Claimants observe that the Yukos standard is not limited to “extreme circumstances such as
the destruction of a company or the elimination of a political opponent” since the purpose of the
standard is not to allow a host State from evading international liability by “disguising a measure
as a tax”.'©? Even if such an extreme circumstance is necessary for the Yukos standard, this
criterion can be met by the fact that the Respondent introduced the Solar Levy only for the
purpose of evading international liability.'"” The Claimants submit that if the Respondent truly
had intended to mitigate the burden on consumers, it would have simply reduced the FiT level.!”’
The Claimants contend that the Solar Levy was introduced for the purpose of “offset[ing] the
introduction of the support from the State budget to pay the FiT”, instead of raising the State’s
revenue.'” This is confirmed by the three indicators.'”* First, the Solar Levy was introduced in
a retroactive manner, targeting a very narrow group, i.e., photovoltaic plants commissioned in

Supreme Administrative Court has decided in its decision of July 10, 2014, that the Solar Levy

was not a tax.'° The Czech Constitutional Court also has confirmed that the Solar Levy in

substance reduced the FiT support level in its decisions of May 15, 2012, February 6, 2014 and
January 13, 2015.'7”

The Claimants contend that the Solar Levy is not a tax even under Czech domestic tax law for

the following reasons. '”*

As a threshold matter, the Tax Administration Law does not provide a general definition of

tax.!7

The definition in Article 2(3) of the Tax Administration Law applies only for
administration and collection of payments.'* The Respondent’s reliance on this definition is

misplaced. '*!

The Claimants contend that whether the Solar Levy is a tax should be analysed in accordance
with the common academic theory, according to which a tax generally has six features: “(a)
obligatory, (b) non-refundable and (c) non-equivalent payment (d) introduced by law, (e)
intended to serve as income of the state budget for the financing of society-wide needs and (f)

paid for no specific purpose.” !*?

According to the Claimants, the Solar Levy lacks at least two of these six features, namely: (c)

non-equivalent payment; and (f) paid for no specific purpose. '**

The Solar Levy is paid for a specific purpose, because it was introduced to “reduc[e] the burden

The Solar Levy does not involve the non-equivalent payment feature, which is found “when the
taxpayer receives no direct consideration from the State for paying the tax.”'*> Under the
financing mechanism introduced by the Act No. 402/2010, the State collected the Solar Levy
from the solar energy producers, and used the amount for the compensation to the grid operators,
who paid the FiT to the producers.'** Because the collected Solar Levy constituted a source of
FiT, which the solar energy producers received, the Claimants allege that the producers received

direct consideration by the payment of the Solar Levy.'*”

This conclusion is confirmed by the Czech Supreme Administrative Court decision of July 10,
2014, which concluded the Solar Levy did not meet the requirement of non-equivalence and was
a de facto reduction of the FiT, finding that “the state use[d] the levy to lower the support it
calculated and provided.”'** According to the Claimants, this is a key and the only judgement in
which the Czech court analysed the nature of the Solar Levy.'*? The Court carefully examined
the nature of the Solar Levy since the issue was whether the Solar Levy and the corporate income
tax constituted double taxation on the same income.'*’ The Claimants observe that this ruling
was confirmed at least four times by the Constitutional Court and the Grand Chamber of the

Supreme Administrative Court.!*!

The Claimants submit that all of the Czech court decisions cited by the Respondent are irrelevant
to the issue of whether the Solar Levy is a tax for the purposes of Article 21(1) ECT.'” The

No. US 2216/14, which indicated that the Solar Levy was a “tax or fee”, did not provide a precise

characterization of the Solar Levy.'**

The Claimants submit that further aspects indicate the non-taxation nature of the Solar Levy.'*°
First, the legislative process of the Act No. 402/2010 was atypical for a tax. The bill was prepared
by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, instead of the Ministry of Finance, which governs taxation
measures.'*’ Second, both the extremely limited scope of application and the unusual association
with non-tax parameters in identifying the payers of the Solar Levy make it even harder to classify

the Solar Levy as a tax measure.!*

Third, the temporariness of the Solar Levy was
unprecedented.'*” The Solar Levy was initially introduced only for a three-year period from
January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013. Fourth, the use of the term “levy”, instead of “tax”,
indicates the Czech Parliament’s awareness of not imposing a tax.””" Finally, the Czech courts
found that the Solar Levy may have had “strangling effects”, which violates a proportionality test
under which a tax should not lead a tax payer to liquidation."

In the Claimants’ view, the Solar Levy is a deduction of the FiT, instead of a tax.?° This is
confirmed by the statement of Mr Kocourek, then Minister of Industry and Trade, which
described the Solar Levy as “a new source of income” for the Czech Republic to provide
budgetary support for the RES support mechanism.?" The Claimants submit that, as Mr Kotab
also accepts, the Czech Constitutional Court decision of May 15, 2012, and the Czech Supreme
Administrative Court decisions of July 10, 2014 and December 17, 2013 have considered the
Solar Levy as a de facto reduction of the FiT.2> The Claimants observe that nevertheless the

Respondent choose not to simply reduce the FiT in order to mitigate arbitration risks.”

The Claimants allege that the wording of Article 21(7) of the ECT, “‘relating to’ taxes of
domestic law”, was not meant to widen the scope of the carve-out beyond mere domestic taxation
measures.” The Claimants observe that the Respondent’s focus on these words suggests the

R dent’s admission that the d cannot be considered as tax under Czech

The Claimants object to the Respondent’s assertion that Italian and French versions of the ECT
employ the language of “fiscal measures”, instead of “taxation measures”. The Claimants

submit that the Italian and French words of “misura fiscale” and “mesure fiscale” have the same

meaning of “taxation measures” in the English version. Indeed, the Spanish and German

to the English “taxation measures”.?!"

The Parties do not agree whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimants’ claims under
the ECT. As summarized above, the Respondent contends that all of the Respondent’s
amendments to the Incentive Regime — the introduction and extension of the Solar Levy, the
repeal of both the Income Tax Exemption and the Shortened Depreciation Period — qualify as
“Taxation Measures” under of Article 21 of the ECT and therefore are excluded from the scope
of the ECT." Article 21(1) of the ECT provides:

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or

impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event

of any inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article

shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.
Article 21(7)(a) of the ECT describes the term “Taxation Measures” as including:

(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a political

subdivision thereof or a local authority therein; and

(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of double taxation or
of any other international agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound.

Paragraph (7) of Article 21 further specifies:

alienation of property, taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts, or substantially similar taxes,
taxes on the total amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises, as well as taxes on capital

(c) A “Competent Tax Authority” means the competent authority pursuant to a double

in force, the minister or ministry responsible for taxes or their authorised representatives.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the terms “tax provisions” and “taxes” do not include customs

As summarized above,?!?

the Respondent contends that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction
to entertain any of Claimants’ ECT claims because its jurisdiction under Article 26(1) of the ECT
is limited to “disputes ‘concern[ing] an alleged breach of an obligation’ set out in Articles 10 to
17 of the ECT.”?' According to the Respondent, “’[t]he measures challenged by the Claimants
in this arbitration, namely: the introduction of the Solar Levy, the repeal of the Income Tax
Exemption and the prolongation of the Solar Levy’ are all ‘Taxation Measures’ within the
meaning of the ECT;”?" accordingly, they are excluded from the scope of Article 26’s dispute

settlement provision.

The Claimants have abandoned their claim concerning the depreciation measures?" and stated
explicitly that they do not dispute that the repeal of the Income Tax Exemption constitutes a
“Taxation Measure” under Article 21(7) of the ECT.?"’ The Respondent emphasized this at the
Hearing interpreting this as an “admission by Claimants that they do not contest that their ECT
claims based on the repeal of the Income Tax exemption are barred by the Article 21 carve out,”
and the Claimants did not comment on it.’!* The Tribunal agrees. It cannot be disputed that the
repeal of the Income Tax Exemption constitutes a “Taxation Measure” for the purposes of the
ECT. The Tribunal therefore concludes that it has no jurisdiction to entertain the Claimants’

claims arising out of this measure.

“Taxation Measure” for the purpose of Article 21(7) of the ECT. According to the Claimants, the
ECT tax carve-out and its reference to domestic law should be interpreted in accordance with the
rules of interpretation of international treaties contained in the VCLT.?" According to Article
31(1)’s general rule of interpretation, the Claimants assert, “the definition of ‘taxation measure’
of Article 21(7) and the relevance of the reference to domestic law must be interpreted ‘in good
faith’ and bearing in mind the ‘context’ of the relevant expressions and the ‘object and purpose’
of the ECT.” The ordinary meaning of a term contained in an international treaty is to be
identified in the light of its object and purpose.””! Exclusively relying on the host state’s domestic
legislation to define the scope of the ECT’s tax carve-out, as the Respondent argues, would allow
the host state “to escape its international obligations under the ECT by simply labelling a measure
as a tax.””? That however would be at odds with the purpose of the ECT which, the Claimants

assert, is “to promote long-term cooperation in the energy field.””*

The Claimants contend that the ECT’s tax carve-out must be limited to taxes imposed in good
faith.°*4 Applying this principle, the Claimants follow the approach taken by the tribunals in the
Yukos and the parallel Hulley and Veteran cases”> and conclude that the relevant standard for
determining whether a particular regulatory measure qualifies as a “Taxation Measure” under
Article 21(7) of the ECT is “whether it comes within the definition of ‘bona fide taxation actions,
i.e., actions that are motivated by the purpose of raising general revenue for the State.””?”° The
Claimants argue that the Solar Levy does not meet this bona fide standard, regardless how the
measure might be sought to be characterized under Czech law.””’ In any event, according to the
Claimants, the Respondent’s characterization of the Solar Levy as a tax under both Czech Law

and the autonomous standard applied by certain non-ECT tribunals is incorrect: the Solar Levy

neither constitutes a tax under Czech law~** nor under the autonomous standard applied by certain

tribunals operating under the US-Ecuador and Canada-Ecuador BITs.”?

The Tribunal agrees that Article 21 of the ECT as a whole must be interpreted in accordance with
the VCLT. The applicable provision here is the general rule of treaty interpretation in Article 31,
which provides that “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and

purpose.”

Article 21(7) of the ECT sets forth no self-standing definition of “Taxation Measures.” Instead
Article 21(7)(a) of the ECT provides that such measures include “any provision relating to taxes
of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a local
authority therein” as well as “any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance
of double taxation or of any other international agreement or arrangement by which the

Contracting Party is bound.”

The Tribunal notes that, unsurprisingly, neither of the Parties has suggested that the Solar Levy
qualifies as a “Taxation Measure” under the second subparagraph of Article 21(7)(a) of the ECT,
(i.e. under an applicable international instrument), but that the Parties have centred all their
arguments on the first subparagraph of Article 21(7)(a) referring to the domestic law of a

Contracting Party

The Parties disagree on how this provision should be interpreted, the Claimants arguing that its
explicit reference to domestic law does not reduce “the interpretation of the ECT tax carve-out

992:

to an exercise in Czech law.”?*° According to the Claimants, the definition of “Taxation Measure”
according to Article 21(7) and the relevance of the reference to domestic law must be interpreted
in accordance with the general rule of treaty interpretation in Article 31(1) of the VCLT and
“therefore be interpreted ‘in good faith’ and bearing in mind the ‘context’ of the relevant
expressions and the ‘object and purpose’ of the ECT.””*! The Respondent contends, in turn, that
the Tribunal need only consider whether the Czech legislative provisions that introduced and
later extended the Solar Levy constitute provisions relating to taxes of the domestic law of the

Czech Republic in order to determine whether these measures fall in the scope of the ECT’s tax

carve-out.”*? Because, according to the Respondent, the Solar Levy constitutes a tax under Czech

Law, it qualifies under the ECT’s tax carve-out.”**

The Tribunal takes the view that in order to ascertain whether a putative tax measure qualifies
under Article 21 of the ECT a two-step analysis is required: a characterization under domestic

law followed by an application of Article 21’s inherent limits.

The starting point of such analysis must be the characterisation of the putative tax measure by
the State relying on the tax carve-out. In the Respondent’s words “it must look to the domestic
law of the Czech Republic” to determine whether the Solar Levy qualifies as a “provision relating
to taxes” under Article 21 of the ECT. *™ The Tribunal accepts that, in order for Article 21 of the
ECT to apply, the domestic law of the host state must characterize the measure as a tax in nature
and substance. That is clear from the text of Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT, which is directed to
“any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law” of the state in question. As the Respondent
observes, this language focuses inquiry directly on the domestic law of the state relying on Article

21 of the ECT.

This interpretation is consistent with the need to interpret the ECT, including Article 21, in
accordance with the VCLT and applicable rules of international law, which the Respondent
explicitly recognizes.”** Interpreting Article 21 of the ECT in accordance with the VCLT requires
that effect be given to the ordinary meaning of Article 21(7)’s reference to the domestic law of

the state relying on the ECT’s tax carve-out.

In addition to requiring an interpretation of treaty-terms according to their “ordinary meaning,”
Article 31(1) of the VCLT also requires the Tribunal to interpret the terms of Article 21 of the
ECT in the light of the ECT’s object and purpose. This interpretation is also consistent with the
objective of Article 21, which was to permit, within the limits of Article 21, contracting states to
exclude specific measures from certain of the ECT’s international protections. Put simply, the
terms of Article 21, interpreted in accordance with Article 31(1) of the VCLT, require reference
to the domestic law of the state adopting a particular measure, in order to determine whether that
measure constitutes a tax measure under the domestic law of that state. The result, a contrario,
is that unless a measure constitutes a tax measure as a matter of its domestic law, Article 21’s

purposes are not applicable. Article 21 applies only to those measures which a contracting state

Award
to the ECT characterizes as tax measures within its domestic legal system (or within applicable

international conventions).

If the putative taxation measure is found to constitute a taxation measure under the host state’s
domestic law, then, as discussed below, in a second step, an interpretation of the scope of the
ECT’s tax carve-out in accordance with Article 31(3) of the VCLT requires to consider the limits
which Article 21 of the ECT imposes on those measures. However, before those limits become
potentially relevant, a putative taxation measure must first constitute a tax measure as a matter of

domestic law.

The Tribunal takes the view that when analyzing whether a certain measure is to be characterized
as a taxation measure under domestic law, considerations of substance should prevail over a
formalistic approach. In that sense although the Tribunal attaches some importance to the fact
that the Solar Levy was titled just that — the Solar “Levy” — not the Solar “Tax” or some other
type of tax, it is hesitant to assign decisive weight to a formal element as is the denomination of
the measure. As the Respondent’s expert, Mr Petr Kotab, argues, in Czech law “the term ‘levy’
is very frequently used to designate payments that are more properly classified as ‘taxes’ or
‘fees’.”?*° As discussed below, however, there are other significant considerations arguing
against, not only a formal but also substantial, characterization of the measure as a tax under
Czech law. The Tribunal heard considerable expert and other evidence on this point. The Parties’
experts mainly focused on the definition of “tax” under Czech tax theory and on the position of
Czech courts, namely the Supreme Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court, on the

question whether the Solar Levy qualifies as a tax under Czech law.

Preliminarily, the Tribunal takes the view that reliance on the fact that the Solar Levy is
administered by the Tax Administration Law is not dispositive of the question whether the Solar
Levy constitutes a tax in substance. The “definition” of tax contained in the Tax Administration
Law extends to many payments which by their nature are not taxes; reliance on the Tax
Administration Law is therefore unsuitable to give a conclusive answer as to whether or not a
payment it governs is in nature a tax. This was not contradicted by Respondent’s expert Mr. Petr

Kotab at the Hearing.?*”

Kotéb Report, para. 35. However, the same consideration applies, a contrario, to the Respondent's
contention that the fact that “Claimants’ financial statements also describe the Solar Levy as a ‘solar tax’”
has decisive weight on the characterisation of the Solar Levy as a tax. See Rejoinder, para. 355 referring
to R-279, FVE Usilné s.r.0. financial statements as of December 31, 2015, p. 6; R-280, FVE Stiibro s.r.0.

Likewise, the Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s argument that academic literature, in these
particular circumstances, does not provide substantial guidance as to whether or not the Solar
Levy is “legally a tax.”?** There is very little commentary addressing the characterization of the
Solar Levy under Czech law and that commentary which does exist does not address many of the

Czech judicial decisions referenced by the Parties.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that the decisions of the Czech Courts are of
particular relevance for the characterization of the Solar Levy. In this regard, the Tribunal notes
that Czech Courts have, at least prima facie, come to divergent characterization of the Solar Levy.
While some court decisions refer to the Solar Levy as a tax, others come to the opposite result,
finding that the Solar Levy is not a tax in substance. However, the former primarily addressed
the issue of whether the Solar Levy qualified formally as a tax, in particular for purposes of the
Tax Administration Law rather than addressing the issue of whether the Solar Levy constitutes a
tax in substance. This applies to the decision of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme
Administrative Court of December 17, 2013, cited by the Respondent as evidence that the Solar

Levy was a tax for purposes of Czech law.

The Tribunal concludes instead that the Czech Supreme Administrative Court decision of July
10, 2014 — and the various other Czech court decisions — are authoritative on the issue of the
characterisation of the Solar Levy. In that case, the Czech Court made the finding that the Solar
Levy is not a tax for purposes of the prohibition against double taxation under Czech law. The
Supreme Administrative Court expressly addressed the question whether, in combination with
the corporate income tax, the Solar Levy would have been an improper instance of double
taxation and rejected that conclusion, holding that the Solar Levy was paid for a specific
consideration, “the government subsidy,” and therefore not a tax, whose “common essential

feature ... is their non-equivalence,” but a de facto reduction of the FiTs and Green Bonuses.

In its decision, the Supreme Administrative Court stated in paragraph 19:

 

The Supreme Administrative Court notes with regard to the petitioner's argumentation
regarding the nature of the levy as a tax that the nature of any tax in the taxation system
involves the government requiring funds from tax payers without immediate compensation.
It can thus be stated that a common essential feature of all taxes is their non-equivalence.
The subject of the levy collected under the Renewable Energy Sources Act is the amount
resulting from the consideration of stipulating the amount of government support for this type

to a great many payments that are clearly not taxes. A. It extends to many payments which are not labeled
as taxes, and also to payments which by their nature are not taxes. Q. In short, the TAL just cannot give us
a conclusive answer as to whether or not a payment that it governs is in nature a tax? A. I would tend to
agree that it cannot or it does not give us a conclusive answer, although I would say it gives us certain
indication or direction.”).

of economic activity. Unlike collecting income tax on income resulting from the activities of
the entity subject to the tax without any performance from the state at the time of taxation,
the state uses the levy to lower the support it calculated and provided. The levy was therefore
correctly not included under Section 36 of the Income Taxes Act among the income subject
to the withholding tax and that is not included in the tax base, for the reasons consisting of
the differing natures of a levy and a tax. Despite the fact that the levy uses the same collection
mechanism as for withholding taxes on certain types of income, the levy does not have the
nature of a tax. (Emphasis added)

 

  

In the Court’s view, the essential feature of a tax was that of non-equivalence, i.e. that taxes are
paid without concrete consideration. Since the Court considered the subsidies in form of FiTs
and Green Bonuses a “performance from the state” directly linked to the collection of the Solar
Levy, it found that the Solar Levy lacked the characteristic of “non-equivalence” and hence “does
not have the nature of a tax” and “is in nature a decrease in government subsidy and not a tax.””
Accordingly, the Court concluded that the Solar Levy “as introduced by Act No. 402/2010 Coll.
is in nature a decrease in government subsidy and not a tax, where the basic criterion is non-

. 32
equivalence.”

The Tribunal accepts that, as conceded by the Claimants’ expert wT in the hearing,
there “might be differences in the definitions” of taxes in Czech academic literature.”“! However,
the Tribunal notes that it is undisputed that the element of non-equivalence is an essential feature
to distinguish taxes from fees under Czech law — in both case-law and academic doctrine.*””
Whether the Solar Levy lacked or not the distinguishing feature of non-equivalence was heavily
disputed between the Parties’ experts. In that regard, the Tribunal is also mindful of the
Respondent’s contention that Czech academic literature, in particular Mr Radim Bohaé in a 2013
publication, has described the Solar Levy as non-equivalent. However, in his analysis, Mr Bohaé
concedes that with regard to the Solar Levy one could “speak of ... some form of material and

remote equivalence.”** This analysis is essentially consistent with Mi characterisation

of the Solar Levy as being “formally non-equivalent,” but materially bearing a direct causal link

to the payment of the FiTs.”“4

The Tribunal also notes that Mr Bohaé’s analysis precedes the July 10, 2014 Supreme
Administrative Court judgment and that the Respondent failed to submit evidence that Mr Bohaé
maintains his analysis in view of the Supreme Court’s contrary conclusion.”“> The Tribunal does
not consider that it should attach the same weight to this analysis, as to the July 10, 2014 decision
of the Supreme Administrative Court. This decision is directly relevant to the question whether
the Solar Levy was characterized as a tax for purposes of Czech law. The Czech Supreme
Administrative Court specifically concluded that the Solar Levy could not be treated as a tax in
substance, and thus could not provide the basis for a finding of double taxation. In the Tribunal’s
view, that conclusion directly addresses the proper characterization of the Solar Levy under

Czech law.

The Supreme Administrative Court received argument on these questions and rendered a
considered decision, in its July 10, 2014 judgment, expressly addressing the characterization of
the Solar Levy. Moreover, this characterization was a significant and necessary element in the
Court’s holding (that the tax payers were not entitled to protection against double taxation). As
Mr Kotdb conceded, that decision has neither been overturned nor otherwise criticized in later
judgments by Czech Courts.“ Importantly, other judgments of Czech courts, including the
Constitutional Court, have likewise ruled that the Solar Levy is not a tax, but in substance a

reduction of the FiT.*”

The Tribunal is not persuaded that similar weight should be attached to the various decisions

 

 

of non equivalence, and there is materially a specific purpose.”

cited by the Respondent as evidence that the Solar Levy was a tax for purposes of Czech law.
These decisions principally involve determinations that the Solar Levy is subject to the
procedural and administrative provisions of the Tax Administration Law and is a “tax or fee”
within the meaning of Article 11(5) of the Czech Republic’s Charter of Fundamental Rights and
Freedoms (“Charter”).”“* This was reiterated by Claimant’s expert wi at the Hearing.”

As outlined above, the Tax Administration Law applies to a wide range of fiscal payments,

including fees and other charges?”

which are not generally regarded as taxes under Czech (or
other) law; likewise, Article 11(5) of the Charter applies not only to taxes, but also fees. The
Tribunal does not consider that these authorities establish more than that the Solar Levy was
administered in accordance with general procedures and fairness requirements, applicable to both
taxes and other fiscal charges, under Czech law.5! This, however, is of no weight as the issue
before the Tribunal is not whether the Solar Levy is administrated in accordance with procedures

that apply to taxes (and fees) but whether the Solar Levy is a tax in substance.

The Tribunal therefore considers the conclusions reached by the Czech Administrative Court,
inter alia in its December 17, 2013 and April 18, 2014 decisions, of incidental relevance to the
characterization of the Solar Levy as, in its nature, a tax. Those decisions do not affect the
persuasive force of the Supreme Administrative Court’s July 10, 2014 decision, especially in
light of the decisions of the Constitutional Court and other decisions of the Supreme

Administrative Court finding that the Solar Levy was in substance a reduction of FiTs.

Given the foregoing decisions, the Tribunal is unwilling to adopt a different conclusion as to the
proper characterization of the Solar Levy under Czech law. The Tribunal does not consider it

decisive that, in the Czech legal system, judicial decisions (or decisions of the Supreme

the substance and addressing the substance question.”).

First Report, para 38.

This is particularly evident as regards the decision of the Grand Chamber of the Czech Supreme
Administrative Court of December 17, 2013, to which Respondent attaches particular importance. When
the Court states that “the solar power levy is actually a tax,” it explicitly links that finding to an earlier
finding in that same decision, that the Solar Levy qualified as a tax “pursuant to Section 2(3)(b) of the [Tax
Administration Law],” and that it was “administered by local financial authorities, which proceed pursuant
to the [Tax Administration Law].” See Annex 13 to First! Report, Decision of the Grand Chamber

Administrative Court) are arguably not regarded as sources of law.”*? That is true in many legal
systems. The essential point is that, in determining how the Solar Levy is characterized in the
Czech domestic legal system, the decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court (and the other
decisions noted above) are the best available guidance, regardless of their formal status as a
source of law. In the Tribunal’s view, these decisions are entitled to substantial weight in

determining the characterization of the Solar Levy as a matter of Czech law.

The conclusion reached by the Czech Supreme Administrative Court in its 10 July 2014 decision,
ie. that the Solar Levy does not constitute a tax in substance, finds further support in the
evidentiary record. Firstly, the Respondent itself argued, through its Ministry of Finance, that the
Solar Levy was materially not a tax in proceedings before the Czech Constitutional Court. In
those proceedings, the Finance Ministry formally took the position that, “from the material
perspective, the introduced measures [of the Solar Levy] are considered a reduction of

"253 which is “aimed to decrease the economic feed-in tariffs.”?* Secondly, the

subsidy,
legislative history of the Solar Levy also supports this conclusion as the Czech Government stated
in connection with the measure’s enactment that it was “necessary to find a formally correct
mechanism for reduction of the support of RES from photovoltaic plants, such that it cannot be
legally contested.”?> In the Tribunal’s view, these characterizations — issued by the Czech
Government itself — are precisely consistent with the holding of the Supreme Administrative
Court that the Solar Levy was — rather than a tax — in substance a reduction of the FiT, a
conclusion also reached by the Constitutional Court and the Grand Chamber of the Supreme

Administrative Court in various decisions.

Moreover, and independently of the question of whether or not it qualifies as a taxation measure
under Czech law, the Solar Levy cannot be considered to qualify as a “Taxation Measure” within
the meaning of Article 21(7) of the ECT. The Tribunal is convinced that a measure will only be
exempted from the ECT’s coverage if it falls within the meaning of a “Taxation Measure” as
contemplated by its Article 21. The Tribunal has no doubt that Article 21 imposes limits on those

measures which may be invoked by a Contracting Party under the ECT. Article 21 is, of course,

a provision in an international treaty, subject to interpretation under the VCLT and international
law more generally. It would ignore the ECT’s text, and the specific reference to tax-related

measures in Article 21(7)(a)(ii), to decline to give international content to these terms.

Moreover, a contrary result, in which the reference to “Taxation Measures” in Article 21 had no
international content, would permit Contracting Parties unilaterally to define those measures
which were, and were not, subject to the ECT. In the Tribunal’s view, there is nothing to suggest
that such a view of Article 21 of the ECT was contemplated. It would contradict the purposes of
the ECT, aiming at the establishment of uniform international standards, contrary to the text of
Article 21, which specifically limits the scope of the provision to tax measures. Article 21 clearly

imposes limits on what constitute tax measures which are excluded from the ECT’s coverage.

In that context, the Tribunal finds the Respondent’s assertion, that the language used in the
equally authentic French and Italian versions of the ECT supports a broad scope of the ECT’s tax
carve-out — going beyond taxation measures and including any fiscal measure — unpersuasive.
Article 33(4) of the VCLT provides that “when a comparison of the authentic texts discloses a
difference of meaning which the application of articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning
which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be

adopted.”

As noted above, Article 21 of the ECT does not itself provide an express international definition
of tax measures to which the provision applies. In the Tribunal’s view, there is also no need, in
this arbitration, to comprehensively define what are, and what are not, tax measures for purposes
of Article 21’s limits. Rather, it is sufficient to address one aspect of these limits, which in the

Tribunal’s view is applicable to the Solar Levy.

Similarly situated tribunals have limited the application of Article 21 of the ECT to state actions
directed at raising general revenue for the state. The Yukos tribunal declared that “Article 21
applies only to actions that are motivated for the purpose of raising general revenue for the
State.”**° The Tribunal is persuaded that Article 21 was not intended to encompass measures

which had principal objectives other than the raising of revenue, but rather to exempt measures

which formed part of a Contracting Party’s general tax regime, aimed principally at raising

revenue.

If an ECT tribunal were to consider only the form of the measure rather than its substance, it
would provide the scope for abuse of the ECT’s tax carve-out, as the contracting states would be
able to escape their obligations under Part III of the ECT, and thus liability from their violations
thereof, simply by labelling governmental actions as “taxation” measures. There is no indication
in the ECT that an ECT tribunal’s jurisdiction does not encompass the determination of whether
a particular measure constitutes a “Taxation Measure” for the purpose of Article 21 of the ECT.
An ECT tribunal must therefore make a substantive determination of the measure in light of the
relevant facts rather than simply adopting the contracting state’s own, formal characterization of

that measure.

It is true that one purpose of the Solar Levy was to raise revenue of the State budget (as one of
the sources to cover the cost of subsidies to solar investors). Critically, however, the Solar Levy
was structured as it was — covering only a certain class of solar energy producers and being
calculated as a percentage of the FiT - in order to alter the level of the FiT rather than to raise
revenue. That is confirmed, in the Tribunal’s view, by the narrow class of persons subject to the
Solar Levy (thereby limiting the revenue raised), the method of calculating the Solar Levy (which
had the effect of reducing the FiT) and the method of collection and payment of the FiT (which
involved withholding of amounts from the FiT paid to solar energy investors). In these respects,

the Solar Levy’s principal purpose was to reduce the FiT for certain investors.

As discussed above, both the Czech Supreme Administrative Court and the Czech Constitutional
Court, as well as the Czech Ministry of Finance in its submissions to the Constitutional Court,
concluded that the Solar Levy was in essence a reduction of the FiTs payable to certain solar
energy producers. The Respondent’s expert Mr Kotdb accepted that the characterization that the
Solar Levy is, in substance, a reduction of the FiTs is now well established in Czech law, although
in his view this did not necessary mean that the Solar Levy was not a tax.°’ At the Hearing he
admitted that the characterisation of the Solar Levy as a reduction of the FiTs “has been expressed
repeatedly by courts, including Constitutional Court, so we may stick to the idea expressed here,
in essence or in substance, this includes the reduction of a FiT ... .”?°8 This was further evidenced

by both government statements made during the measure’s enactment and the structure of the

measure.*” In the Tribunal’s view, the evidence in the record, including expert testimony,

confirms that the essence of the Solar Levy was the reduction of certain FiTs.

In light of this principle, the Tribunal concludes that the Solar Levy does not fall within the scope
of Article 21 of the ECT. In this regard are of particular importance statements made in
connection with the enactment of the Solar Levy, including the statements of the Minister of
Industry and Trade on November 2, 2010 at meetings of the Economic Committee of the
Chamber of Deputies.” These statements clearly show that the Solar Levy’s principal objective
was a reduction in the level of the FiTs payable to certain solar investors, and not the raising of
revenue; they also show that the Solar Levy was structured, in many respects, as a tax in order to

reduce the risk of claims against the Czech Republic under international law.

By finding that the Respondent formulated the structure of the Solar Levy — resembling, in many
respects, a tax — principally for the purpose of taking the reduction in the FiTs outside the
protections accorded by several international investment treaties, including the ECT, the Tribunal
does not imply that the Respondent was acting in bad faith. The Respondent might very well have
attempted to reduce the FiTs in a manner that would be consistent with its legal obligations,
including its investment protection obligations. The Tribunal merely finds that these attempts,
including making the Solar Levy subject to the procedures set out in the Tax Administration Law,
cannot change the fact the Solar Levy is, in substance, a measure whose objective was a reduction
in the level of the FiTs payable to certain class of solar investors, and not the raising of revenue

for the State.

B. Whether the Claimants complied with the notice requirements under the BIT and the

ECT with regard to the claims arising out of the extension of the Solar Levy by Act
310/2013

1. The Respondent’s position

254. In its Statement of Defense the Respondent contended that the Claimants’ claim as to the
Extension of the Solar Levy by the Act No. 310/2013 Coll. (the “Solar Levy Extension Claim’)
failed to satisfy the requirements of the prior written notification and the cooling-off period under
Article 10(2) of the BIT and Article 26(2) of the ECT.”*' The Respondent alleged that even
though the Claimants had ample opportunities to raise the Solar Levy Extension Claim after the
adoption of the Act of September 13, 2013, the Claimants had not done so until the Statement of
Claim of April 7, 2014.2

255. Article 10 of the BIT provides:

(1) Disputes relating to investments between either Contracting Party and an investor of the
other Contracting Party should as far as possible be settled amicably between the parties
in dispute.

(2

If a dispute cannot be settled within six months of the date when it was notified by one
of the parties in dispute, it shall, at the request of the investor of the other Contracting
Party, be submitted to arbitration.

256. Article 26 of the ECT provides:

(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party
relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged
breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a
period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested
amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for
resolution [...].2*

2. The Claimants’ position

257. The Claimants took the view that the Solar Levy Extension Claim, i.e. the claim in respect of the
prolongation of the Solar Levy, could not be characterized as a new dispute requiring an extra

written notification and a new waiting period.” The notice of dispute dated June 10, 2011

referred to the adoption of Act No. 204/2010 concerning the introduction of the Solar Levy, and
the Solar Levy Extension Claim concerns only the extension of the Solar Levy.” On this basis,
the Claimants contended that the Solar Levy Extension Claim was the same dispute in substance
as that contained in the notice of dispute and thus did not require a separate notification and

cooling-off period from the original claims.”°”

3. The Tribunal’s conclusion

258. The Respondent did not pursue this objection in its Rejoinder, or during the hearing, but did not

formally withdraw it.

259. The notice of dispute dated June 10, 2011 referred to Act 402/2010, which introduced the Solar
Levy. The Solar Levy was extended by Act 310/2013.

260. The Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimants’ argument is right. The claim relating to the Solar
Levy extension is the same dispute in substance as that contained in the notice of dispute and

does not require a separate notification and cooling-off period from the original claims.

C. Whether the Claimants’ alleged misrepresentations in obtaining the operating licence

for the Mozolov plant bar their claims in relation to the plant

D. Whether the Claimants have made a prima facie showing of a violation of the BIT and

ECT in relation to the HolySov plant

IX. The substantive claims: legitimate expectation and arbitrary or unreasonable
behaviour

1. The Claimants’ position

262. Asa threshold matter, the Claimants observe that their ECT claims should be maintained even if
their ECT claims are “almost identical” to their BIT claims.*** The Claimants describe that this
is because (1) the ECT is “more specific in protecting investments in the energy sector”; and (2)

interference of the European Commission in relation to the enforcement of an eventual award.”?”

The Claimants contend that the Respondent violated an obligation to provide a stable and
predictable legal framework by modifying the Incentive Regime.”

According to the Claimants, the obligation to provide a stable and predictable investment
framework may be distinguished from the obligation to protect an investor’s legitimate
expectations.?”! The former concerns investors’ basic expectations as to stability of an investment
framework, while the latter requires an analysis of individual investors’ expectations.” In the
Claimants’ view, the obligation to provide a stable and predictable investment framework arose
from (1) “the Incentive Regime’s intrinsic attribute of stability”; and (2) “the specific treaties
invoked by the Claimants in this case”.?”

As for “the Incentive Regime’s intrinsic attribute of stability”, the Claimants submit that the
Incentive Regime was established to attract investments in the photovoltaic sector by providing
long-term incentives.” This inherent nature of the Incentive Regime created basic expectations
and a promise that the Czech Republic would not modify the Incentive Regime, which are
protected under the standard of “fair and equitable treatment” (“FET”).””

The Claimants submit that the requirements of protection of the investors’ basic expectations as
to stability are essential elements of the FET standard.” This is confirmed by the tribunal in

Tecmed and other subsequent tribunals.””” The tribunal in Bayindir v. Pakistan further elaborated

that a host State’s policy change may lead to a violation of the FET standard.” This is
particularly relevant to the present case, where the Czech Republic changed its policy towards

the photovoltaic investors.?”

The Claimants contend that the obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal framework
also derives from specific treaties invoked by the Respondent, i.e., the BIT and the ECT.”*’ These
treaties share the purpose to promote investment between contracting States by establishing a

stable investment environment.”*!

The Claimants allege that a promise of stability may arise in the absence of a stabilization
clause.”*? The Respondent is said to have accepted this when stating that the Act on Promotion
provided a promise of a 15-year simple payback and a 7% rate of return, even if the Act did not
contain a stabilization clause.’** Such a payback and a rate of return, are undeniably a form of
stability, with limited scope.”** The Claimants contend further that a contractual stabilization
clause is unnecessary, considering that, in the circumstances of the RES sector, the host State
does not enter a contractual relationship with individual investors.?°> In the Claimant’ s view, the

cases that the Respondent relies on, including Parkerings v. Lithuania,”*°

are distinguishable
from the case at hand, because in those cases the tribunals found no basic or specific promise of

stability by host States.°°”

The Claimants further contend that a stabilization clause is irrelevant to the issue of whether a
host State owes an international obligation not to amend its legal framework.”** In the Claimant’ s

view, a stabilization clause only generates an obligation under domestic law, and accordingly it

does not constrain a host State’s authority to change its domestic legislation.” This view is
supported by the tribunal in Oxus Gold v. Uzbekistan, which provided that “a [stabilization]
clause in a law or a general regulation does not give a vested right to the investor, as the State

can always modify its laws and general regulations.”?”°

The Claimants argue that the Respondent violated the Claimants’ legitimate expectations with
reference to the Incentive Regime, so as to satisfy the three prongs of the test applied by most
arbitral tribunals, including, in particular, the Micula tribunal: “(a) the Respondent made a
promise, assurance or representation of regulatory stability; (b) the Claimants relied on such
promise, assurance or representation; and (c) such reliance was reasonable.””?' The Claimants
observe that the doctrine of legitimate expectations is irrelevant to the reasonableness of a host

, 202
State’s measure.”

The Claimants contend that they had legitimate expectations that “(i) the FiT level would remain
stable over the lifetime of the project (i.e. 20 years), and (ii) the Income Tax Exemption would
last for 6 years (i.e. the first calendar year of operation of the plant plus the following five

ones)”.23

According to the Claimants, because the FET standard does not expressly provide which types
of investors’ expectations can be considered as legitimate, and accordingly “one has to determine
whether, in the specific circumstances, the State’s behaviour gave rise to an expectation that its
legislative framework would not change to the detriment of the investors”.”"* The Claimants then
submit that the specific circumstances in the present case was that the Respondent intended to

attract investors by providing long and stable incentives through the Incentive Regime.”

The Claimants submit that domestic legislation can be treated as promises to foreign investors,

referring to several legal authorities.?”° Based on this proposition, the Claimants take the view

that the Czech Republic made explicit promises of stability to the investors throughout its
legislation including the Act on Income Tax and the Act on Promotion.”*” In this vein, the recent
decision in Charanne v. Spain, in which the tribunal found an individual commitment was
necessary for investors to enjoy legitimate expectations as to stability of investment framework,
can be distinguished on the facts.”°* In that case, the claimants invoked unreasonably long period

of stability, i.e., 30 to 50 years.°°?

The Claimants provide a more specific analysis of the promises contained in Section 6 of the Act
on Promotion.*” First, Section 6(1)(b)(2) provided a guarantee that “once it is established, the
feed-in-tariffs cannot be reviewed for a given period of time, except for an increase, according to

The Claimants allege that these expectations were strengthened by the purpose and context of the
Incentive Regime.*”? The Explanatory Report on the bill of the Act on Promotion evidences that
the Act on Promotion was enacted to meet the 8% EU target for 2010 under the EU policy of
promoting RES.*" The importance of the achievement of 8% target is evidenced by Mr Fiit’s

producers, the energy sale price is in fact fundamental to the economics of a solar investment”.*°°
The Claimants emphasize that it was the guarantee of the long-term stable FiT which was integral
to deciding to invest in RES.*°’ The importance of the stable FiT is evidenced by the fact that

the investments in photovoltaic plants were up-front.>°

According to the Claimants, the Explanatory Report shows that the Income Tax Exemption and
the Shortened Depreciation Period constituted essential part of the Incentive Regime, in stating
that “the support system is based [...] on maintaining the tax reliefs to the extent set out in the
Act[s] on Income Tax”. *” In addition, the fact that the Act on Promotion did not mention the
Income Tax Exemption is immaterial.*'? This was simply because the Income Tax Exemption
was already established by the Act on Income Tax when the bill of the Act on Promotion was

being discussed.*"!

The evidentiary value of the Explanatory Report is not decreased, say the Claimants, by the facts
that the Report itself was not a legal source and that the Report was not specifically addressed to
the Claimants.*!? The Report shows significant insight of the legislative process and the purpose

313

of the Act on Promotion.” An individualized promise is not necessary in invoking the protection

of legitimate expectations.*"

The Claimants then contend that these general promises provided by the Act on Promotion and
the Act on Income Tax were converted into specific promises by going through the licensing

process and gaining required permissions to build and operate photovoltaic power plants.*!5

the stable FiT can be characterized as specific promises to photovoltaic investors.*'®

The Claimants contend that a promise contained in the Act on Promotion was not limited to the
15-year simple payback and the 7% WACC.*!” A promise of 15-year simple payback would
contradict to the purpose of the Act on Promotion, since such a payback was insufficient to attract
enough investors in order to achieve the EU targets.*!* WACC was a mere non-binding indicator

for the ERO to set a FiT.*"’ Indeed, the Act on Promotion did not contain reference to WACC.*””

According to the Claimants, had it not been for the guarantee that the Incentive Regime should
be granted and maintained, investors like the Claimants would not have invested in photovoltaic

energy production in the Czech Republic.*”!

This is because investors in the long-term RES
business based their investment decisions on guarantees of stability derived from the purpose of

the Incentive Regime.*”

The Claimants make clear that in reliance on the legal framework set up by the Czech Republic
and its commitments contained therein, they acquired or established SPVs, obtained the licences
for energy production and invested a significant amount of money in their photovoltaic plants.*”*
In particular, the Claimants point out that they based their assessment of profitability on the

analysis of the investment and operating costs to set up and operate the solar plants.*7*

The Claimants contend that their reliance on the promises provided for by the Incentive Regime

was reasonable.

The Claimants maintain that their reliance was reasonable as it was predicated on the guarantees
contained in the Incentive Regime and its “declared purpose”.*> According to the Claimants,

to comply with its EU law obligations.”*”°

The Claimants refer to both Czech and EU law to support the contention that their reliance was
reasonable. With regard to Czech law, “the correctness of the Claimants’ understanding of the
Incentive Regime was primarily confirmed by the ERO’s presentations on that matter and by the

personal consultation that Dr Géde had with the Czech law fin EE  _ __

in Prague.”**’ As to EU law, “the compatibility of the Incentive Regime with EU state law was

assessed both before the adoption of the Act on Promotion and after its implementation.”*?*

In addition, the Claimants submit that widespread beliefs among the photovoltaic market that the
Incentive Regime would not be retroactively repealed provide support for the reasonableness of
the Claimants reliance.*” As the tribunal in CMS v. Argentina stated, this is because “[i]t is not
credible that so many companies and governments and their phalanxes of lawyers could have
misunderstood the meaning of the guarantees offered in a manner that allowed for their reversal
within a few years”.**° The Czech local banks financed solar projects for plants to be
commissioned in 2010.**! This is confirmed by the fact that on July 30, 2010, the head of
KPMG’s Transaction and Acquisition Department confirmed that banks were interested in
photovoltaic plants as long as they were commissioned by the end of 2010.**? Such a belief was
also shared by energy experts licensed by the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade, who

the same support level to plants commissioned by the end of 2010.**° Mr Jones, the Respondent's
expert, also accepted that the ERO’s letter of September 8, 2009, the Government’s bill of
November 16, 2009, the Ministry of Industry’s press release of the same date, and the
Government’s bill of September 15, 2010, strengthened the investors’ expectations that the

upcoming change would not affect plants connected in 2010.*°”

The Claimants allege that the Czech Republic kept providing such reassurances during 2010.***
None of the Claimants’ plants was affected by the moratorium on new applications for grid
connections, because all of their plants obtained the capacity reservations before the moratorium
started in February 2010.*” The 2010 Action Plan reaffirmed that the fixed FiT would be

available for 20 years.*"

Act No. 330/2010, which abolished all incentives for plants over
30kWp, only applied installations commissioned from March 1, 2011, and its Explanatory Report
of September 15, 2010 provided that the existing investors would keep enjoying the
incentives.™! Both the 2010 Action Plan and the ERO’s 2010 Report indicated that the future
amendments to the Incentive Regime would not affect the existing investors.” Importantly, Dr
Géde’s last investment was made in the summer of 2010, when the Respondent still kept

providing such reassurances.**

The Claimants submit that the 2010 Action Plan provided a strong reassurance.* First, the Plan
confirmed that the Income Tax Exemption was integral part of the Incentive Regime, by listing
it as available financial support together with FiT and Green Bonuses.*“* Second, the Plan did
not suggest that the FiT level was not maintainable.’ Third, the Plan confirmed that the FiT

would be stable for 20 years in stating that “[the] tariffs are guaranteed according to the following

The Claimants also submit that another strong reassurance was given by the Explanatory Report
to Draft Act No. 330/2010 dated on September 15, 2010, which abolished all of the support for
large photovoltaic plants as of March 1, 2011.*4* The Report provided that “[p]hotovoltaic power
plants already connected to the electric power system will have their right to claim support

preserved under existing conditions.”*”

In the Claimants’ view, the Respondent gave these reassurances in order to (1) provide sufficient
time for investors to prepare for the upcoming scheme change; and (2) achieve the EU target for

2010 by means of contribution from photovoltaic plants.*°°

The Claimants allege that, in 2009 and 2010, it was impossible for photovoltaic investors to
expect that the amendment measures would be introduced in a retroactive manner.**' The
Claimants submit that a number of documents published in 2009 and 2010 provided repeated
reassurances, instead of warnings.*? This was also supported by the fact that even CEZ, a
company controlled by the Czech Republic, kept investing in the photovoltaic market during the
period.**3 The Claimants observe that indeed the introduction of the Solar Levy had not been an

option for the Czech Government until October 14, 2010, when it suddenly changed its policy.***

The Claimants observe that although the Respondent could have repealed the 5% Break-Out Rule
or required grid operators to stop issuing new binding statements as soon as it had recognized the
problem, it had chosen not to do so.**> In the Claimant’s view, this political decision conveyed
a clear message to investors that the FiT level would remain stable for plants commissioned in

2009 and 2010.**°

May 2009 and July 2010 is irrelevant.*°’ It did not amount to a political crisis that might have
affected an investor’s legitimate expectations.*** As shown in its policy statement that it was
prepared to take responsibility to manage the country, the caretaker government had authority to
deal with the increase of the solar installations.*” Indeed, the caretaker government made the

important decision to repeal the 5% Break-Out Rule.*

Similarly, the Claimants object to the Respondent’s assertion that the postponement of the
abolishment of the 5% Break-Out Rule was the result of solar investors’ lobbying and threats of
arbitration.**' No evidence shows that such an activity existed. In any event, legitimate lobbying

activity does not excuse a host State from not addressing a problem in a timely manner.*°

The Claimants contend that their reliance on the Income Tax Exemption was equally

reasonable.***

The repeal of the Income Tax Exemption is distinguished from an ordinary
increase of income tax rate, because the Income Tax Exemption contained a promise of duration
as an essential part of the Incentive Regime.* This position is confirmed, according to the
Respondent, by an expert opinion that the Czech Republic could repeal the Income Tax

Exemption only in a non-retroactive manner.*°

Furthermore, the Claimants submit that Dr Géde’s team was formed by experienced experts
including bankers and a Czech lawyer.*° While Dr Géde did not conduct a specific due diligence
before his investment, his team provided sufficient expertise.” In any event, given the small

size of photovoltaic investments, a sophisticated due diligence should not have been required.**

The Claimants provide that “Dr Géde made the majority of his investment in the Czech Republic

after having confirmed that his first solar plant became operational under the FiT scheme.*”°

The Claimants submit that the Respondent violated its obligation to accord “full protection and
security” (“FPS”) set out in Article 10(1) of the ECT and Articles 2(3) and 4(1) of the BIT by

failing to provide a stable and predictable legal framework as to the Claimants’ investment. *7!

The Claimants submit that the scope of FPS extends beyond physical protection to legal security.
To this extent, FPS and FET substantially overlap, and jointly require a host State to provide a
stable and predictable legal framework.*”* In the present case, the Claimants contend that the

FPS standard was violated by reason of the facts giving rise to a breach of the FET standard.*”*

The Claimants allege that, by dismantling the Incentive Regime, the Respondent violated the
prohibition of arbitrary or discriminatory measures (“Non-Impairment Standard”) set out in

Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article 2(2) of the BIT. *”*

In response to the Respondent’s argument that the Non-Impairment Standard requires an
investor’s impairment to be significant, the Claimants submit that, referring to Saluka, “any
negative impact or effect” caused by a host State’s measure satisfies the impairment

requirement.*”>

The Claimants then submit that in any event their investments were significantly impaired,
referring to Dr Géde’s statement that “the Czech Republic’s retroactive measures greatly
impacted on the economics of [his] investment”.*” Dr Géde expected a return of EUR

The Claimants define an unreasonable measure as referring to “a measure that imposes excessive
burdens on foreign investors not commensurate to the aims pursued or to the results achieved by

the measures.”*”*

The Claimants submit that the determination of whether a measure is reasonable or not requires
analysis of “whether (i) the state pursued a rational policy and (ii) acted reasonably in pursuit of
such policy”, relying on the AES and Micula cases.*” A State’ policy is rational if it is taken
“following a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest
matter”.**° A State acts reasonably if there is “an appropriate correlation between the state’s
policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it.”**! Under the proportionality test, since
the Respondent’s measures destroyed the Claimants’ investments, the Respondent must prove
that “the maintenance of the Incentive Regime, and the allegedly attendant high electricity prices,
would have entailed the catastrophic consequences for the Czech economy that are invoked, in

terms of layoffs, plant shut downs and dramatic drops in the tax revenues.”**?

The Claimants contend that “the Czech Republic’s dismantling of the Incentive Regime was
neither adopted in furtherance of a rational policy, nor were the Czech Republic’s measures

reasonable in the pursuit of such a policy, because the adverse impact on the Claimants’

investment did not outweigh the policy’s benefits.”***

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s assertion that it aimed “to counter soaring electricity

prices and to address alleged ‘windfall profits’ of solar investors.”***

With regard to the “high electricity prices” case, the Claimants assert that “there is no indication
that such a risk was in any way concrete nor that the investors and the Incentive Regime would

be responsible for it.”**°

Rather, the extra costs of RES support, including the tariffs on
consumers, and electricity prices in Czech Republic were lower than those in other EU

countries.**°

Moving on to “the alleged windfall profits of the investors”, the Claimants deny the presence of
such profits.**” Rather, the rates of return provided for by the Incentive Regime at 10-15 % were
in line with those in other EU Member States.*** The Claimants deny that any profit over the
rate of 7% should be considered a windfall, considering that a return rate at the level of 7% would

not have attracted sufficient investment to achieve the 8% EU target for 2010.**”

According to the Claimants, the Respondent’s policy is irrational as “withdrawing benefits that
[the Respondent] had used to induce investors into its solar market” dramatically reduces
prospects for future investment by negatively signalling future investors and making it extremely

difficult for it to attain its target of increasing electricity from solar energy by 2020.°”

The Claimants contend that the Respondent’s amendment measures were unreasonable.

The Claimants submit that a host State’s measures are reasonable only if “its adverse effects on
foreign investments are limited to what is strictly necessary to achieve the public interest and the
public interest outweighs the negative impact on the rights of foreign investors in the specific
case.”*"' In the Claimants’ view, proportionality is required not only between the policy
objectives and the measures, but also between the benefits to the host State and the impact on

investors.**”

In the present case, the Claimants allege that “the Solar Levy is unreasonable because the results

it achieved are completely out of proportion with respect to the harm it caused to solar

investors.”*°> According to the Claimants, the fact that “the end price of electricity continued to
increase even after the introduction of the Solar Levy” confirms the assumption that “the effects
of the Solar Levy on electricity prices were minimal and it did very little [...] to shield households
and industries from purportedly soaring electricity prices.”*** The Claimants assert that this lack
of proportionality was exacerbated by the abrupt legislative process without appropriate

reflection.*°°

The Claimants contend that the repeals of the Income Tax Exemption and the Shortened
Depreciation Period were irrational, pointing out that “there is no explanation as to how the repeal

of the tax exemption can mitigate the increase in electricity prices”.*°*

The Claimants submit that the unreasonableness of the amendment measures was also criticized
by the EU Commissioners, who expressed their concern as to the amendment measures in its
letter of January 11, 2011. The EU Commission in its Communication of 2013 stated that “[a]
need to make changes in regulatory conditions in response to developments in the market does
not justify applying such changes retroactively to investments already made in situations where
the need arises because of failures on the part of the public authorities to correctly predict or

adapt to such developments in a timely manner.”°°”

The Claimants contend that the Czech Constitutional Court decision of May 15, 2012 is not
helpful because “domestic courts cannot provide absolution from violation of international
law.”*°8 The Claimants further submit that the decision is irrelevant to the present case because
the Court (1) employed domestic, instead of international, standards; (2) employed an approach
which was similar to that of expropriation; and (3) was silent as to whether the Czech Republic

violated its obligation towards investors.*”

In the Claimants’ view, the return rates above 7% WACC, which the amendment measures

targeted, should be considered as reasonable, instead of excessive.“ The Claimants find support

in the EU Commission’s 2016 Decision, which confirmed the return rates between 6.3% and
10.6% as reasonable.“°' The Claimants add that while the EU Commission referred the 10.6%
rate regarding biogas, the 10.6% rate is also relevant to solar, given that the 7% WACC was set
for the entire RES including both solar and biogas.“ The return rate of Oseéna plant also
can be seen as reasonable, considering that the EU Commission approved up to 12 to 13% of

return rates in relation to other EU Member States.“°*

The Claimants make four further allegations as to the unreasonableness of the Respondent’s
measures.“ First, the measures were intrinsically irrational, because the Respondent repealed
the essential features of the Incentive Scheme.*” In this regard, the Charanne decision, in which
the tribunal found that the changes to the FiT level and period did not amount to an alternation
of the essential characteristics, is to be distinguished from the present case, because the alleged
period, i.e., 30 to 50 years, was unrealistic for the plants’ lifetime.*°° Second, the measures were
by definition unreasonable, because the Respondent repealed its clear undertaking to RES
investors, which it had made in exchange for their investment.’ Third, the Respondent acted

inconsistently in relation to the investors and its policy goal.“°*

The Respondent repeatedly
announced that the amendments to the Incentive Regime would only affect new plants
commissioned after 2011, nevertheless repealed the incentives provided for plants commissioned
in 2009 and 2010.“ The amendment measures made it difficult for the Respondent to achieve
its long-term policy goal of promoting RES by undermining the Respondent’s reputation among

investors.4"°

Fourth, the Respondent cannot claim the reasonableness of its responses to the
alleged solar boom, because the solar boom was caused by its own mismanagement.*!’ The ERO

repeatedly drew attention to the rise of solar installations at least from 2008, nevertheless the

Respondent did not address this issue until the end of 2010. As a result, the Respondent repealed
the incentives in a retroactive manner, which was unprecedented among the EU Member

States.*!

In the Claimants’ view, Article 25.2(b) of the Draft articles on Responsibility of States
for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the “ILC Draft Articles”), by which a State is precluded from
invoking the necessity defence when the State contributed to the situation of necessity, supports

this assertion.“

The Respondent contends that, in the absence of stabilization clause, a State may change its

legislation without violating investment treaty obligations.*'*

In other words, no legitimate
expectations as to stability of legal framework may arise in the absence of a stabilization
arrangement.*'* Such a stabilization clause can be either legislative or contractual, but a clear
language of prohibiting legislative or regulatory change is required.*'® However, in the present

case, no evidence shows such an explicit arrangement.*!”

As to the alleged stabilization of the FiT level, the Respondent alleges that a simple use of the
word “stable”, as found in the ERO’s report of 2009, is not sufficient to grant a promise of
stabilization.“'* The Respondent denies that the Claimants’ assertion that the Respondent admits
that an obligation of stabilization may arise in the absence of stabilization clause in stating that
the Act on Promotion and the ERO regulations provided for a 15-year simple payback and a 7%
rate of return.“!? Because the Respondent keeps providing the payback and the rate of return, the

stabilization of these incentives is not an issue of the present case. ‘”°

Regarding the Income Tax Exemption, the Respondent calls into doubt the evidentiary value of
the 2003 Explanatory Report on the Bill of the Act on Promotion on which the Claimants seem

forever be available to [the] Claimants”.“?! According to the Respondent, “the 2003 Explanatory
Report does not have the force of law and is not a source of legal rights.“ In addition, the
Respondent notes that “the language in the 2003 Explanatory Report does not look anything like

the type of language that States typically use when entering into a stabilization arrangement.”*”*

The Respondent provides that the ECT does not create such a stabilization despite of its Article
10, which provides that “Each Contracting Party shall [...] encourage and create stable
conditions”.‘** In the Respondent’s view, this does not purport to stabilize a legal framework for
the duration of investment.’?> The Respondent also notes that the BIT does not contain such a

language.*?°

The Respondent further notes that Article 19(d) of the Act on Income Tax does not contain a
“promise” of stabilization, but rather that there would be an exemption from corporate income
tax for “income from the operation of [...] solar installations [...] in the calendar year in which
they were first commissioned and in the immediately following five year period”.“”’ In the
Respondent’s view, the tax exemption’s limitation in time to five years is not a guarantee that
such exemption could not be abolished for five years or that the temporary benefit could not be
subject to legislative amendment or a “grandfathering” rule for existing projects.‘°*

The Respondent alleges that a stabilization clause generates an international obligation, despite
that it is embodied in domestic legislation.’ For instance, legislative acts adopted by Nigeria
and Timor-Leste contain stabilization clauses, under which an investor may file an international

arbitration if the government has violated the stabilization assurance.“

The Respondent points to the Charanne v. Spain award which addressed a similar issue to that

arising in this case, namely, the issue of whether governmental statements issued in connection

with the regulatory framework could support a stabilization guarantee.**!

Noting that the
Charanne tribunal “concluded that there was no evidence at all [...] of any stabilization
guarantee,” the Respondent submits that in the present case, where the Claimants cite only an
explanatory report to a preliminary draft of legislation, there is even less basis for the allegation

of a “guarantee of stabilization” as to the tax exemption.”

According to the Respondent, Section 6 of the Act on Promotion was only meant to provide a
15-year simple payback, i.e., “full return of capital, but without any element of profit”.“*
Nevertheless, in order to attract investors, the ERO decided in its Technical Regulation to provide
them with “an adequate return on invested capital”, which was later set as 7% WACC.*™ In the
Respondent’s view, this 7% WACC should be considered as a reasonable return rate, 435 and as
Mr Fiit testified, well known to public.“° The Respondent points out that Di Claimants’
expert, also accepts that profits above WACC is theoretically “supernormal”.**”” Noting that the
15-year simple payback and the 7% WACC “wlere] not legislatively guaranteed” without a
stabilization arrangement, the Respondent submits that in any event the amendment measures
have not affected these parameters.** This being the case, the Respondent submits that the
Claimants’ investment “has not suffered any adverse effect that is actionable under the ECT or

the BIT” due to the Solar Levy.”

The Respondent points out that the Solar Levy has not changed the amounts of FiT and “affected

the Claimants’ after-tax profits”.““” Accordingly, what the Claimants claim in this arbitration is

not a promise of stable FiT but a promise of profitability.“*' However, the Incentive Regime did

not contain any guarantee of such profitability.“

The Respondent contends that, referring to Arif v. Moldova, a legitimate expectations claim “must
proceed from the exact identification of the origin of the expectation alleged, so that its scope can
be formulated with precision”.““? Therefore, legitimate expectations derived from legislation
must be strictly based on provisions in the legislation in question.’ However, the original Act
on Promotion did not contain any provision that FiTs would not be subject to taxation measures

such as the Solar Levy.“*

The Respondent contends that it had never promoted solar investments in order to achieve the
8% EU target.“ The ERO’s report of November 2009, on which the Claimants rely, merely
listed solar power as one of several RES sources for the achievement.’ Rather, the Report
described the rapid increase in solar installations as “significant problem” and “disadvantaging
other [] RES sources and adversely affecting consumers”.““*

According to the Respondent, “there is certainly no evidence that the Claimants ‘relied’ on the
2003 Explanatory Report or any other document, statement, or communication by the Czech

Republic relating to [the tax exemption].”*”

To support this, the Respondent notes that “the
Claimants effectively admit that [the Income Tax Exemption] was not a determining factor in the
decision to invest [by asserting that] ‘the purpose of the Incentive Regime would be frustrated if
investors could rely only on the FiT support and not on the guarantees already in place and set
out in the Act on Income Tax, which were evidently not sufficient by themselves to attract

should be given to the fact that “the Claimants actually were aware that Czech taxation law might

change.”"**!

The Respondent avers that the Claimants knew, or should have known, that the RES regime was
based on the principle of minimum cost and reasonable (but not excessive) return, as defined by
WACC and required under EU State aid law.**? Furthermore, the Claimants were “almost
certainly aware that the market they were entering was a bubble and that the FiT regime for solar

installations was considered by the Czech authorities to be out of balance.” “°°

The Respondent alleges that the Claimants’ reliance on the assurances was unreasonable.

The Respondent contends that the Claimants knew or should have known that Czech RES support
scheme was structured “based on the principle of minimum cost and reasonable (but not
excessive) return, as defined by the WACC” because the Czech RES market was a regulated
market.* Accordingly, the Claimants’ reliance on the alleged promises by which investors
would have received more than the WACC was not reasonable. This is supported by the
decisions in AES v. Hungary and Electrabel v. Hungary, in which the tribunals affirmed

Hungary’s measures that reduced the tariff rates to the WACC level.

The Respondent also alleges that the Claimants should have expected that “where the government
expressly warn[ed] that returns [of the photovoltaic producers were] contrary to the intent of
existing law, [...] some claw-back of such excessive profits [would be] possible.”**’ In late 2009,
the ERO already expressed that the 2010 FiT would provide excessive returns to photovoltaic
producers.*** The Respondent finds support for this in a Master's thesis at the London School of

Economics, which provides that “[i]nvestors should anticipate that overgenerous FiTs at public

expense could well result in ‘retroactive’ adjustments to support regime.”**°

The Respondent contends that it did not provide the alleged reassurances that FiTs would not be
repealed in relation to plants commissioned by the end of 2010. According to the Respondent,
the fact that the abolition of the 5% Break-Out Rule was once postponed from 2009 to 2010
cannot be considered as a reassurance from the Czech Republic that the upcoming modification
to the Incentive Scheme would not affect plants commissioned by the end of 2010.“ The
Respondent submits that the 1-year postponement was meant to avoid damaging ongoing projects
at that time, i.e., September 2009, and that it did not purport to protect new projects starting after

that moment.**!

Similarly, the fact that abolishment of 5% Break-Out Rule only affected plants commissioned as

2
of March 2011 cannot be seen as such a reassurance.“

The Respondent provides that the
adoption of less drastic measures “cannot be understood as a promise that more drastic measures
would not be required if the situation deteriorated further.” “> The Solar Levy was installed in

such a context that solar installations were unexpectedly increased after the mid of 2010.4"

The Respondent also contends that the moratorium period cannot be considered as a
reassurance.*®* Although the moratorium period had a particular scope, this did not mean that no

other measures would be introduce Rather, in the Respondent’s view, the moratorium

conveyed a clear message that the government did not want further photovoltaic installations.“

The Respondent further contends that the 2010 Action Plan did not provide the message that the
FiT level would be stable for 20 years.“ Although the Plan simply summarized the existing
framework, it did not give a promise that such a framework would remain unchanged.“ Indeed,

an article published in September 2010 stated that the 2010 Action Plan “would basically

reassurance had been given especially after July 2010.” This is when the Neéas government
was established and the Prime Minister stated that the government was considering to introduce

a solar tax.”

The Respondent also alleges that Act No. 330/2010, which abolished all of the photovoltaic

support for large plants as of March 1, 2011, was not a reassurance.*”*

While the explanatory
report on the Act provided that the plants commissioned before March 2011 would enjoy the
existing conditions, it did not mean that other changes would not apply to these plants.*”* The
Respondent describes that Act as having been originally planned to be part of single legislation
to introduce State budgetary support for RES scheme and later separated and became an
independent Act.*” Accordingly, the introduction of the Act was not a sudden policy change of

the Respondent.*”°

The Respondent reacted to the Claimants’ assertion that it could have taken other less harmful
measures.*”’ According to the Respondent, the issue in the present arbitration should be whether
the amendment measures constitute violations of the treaty standards based on the circumstances
when they were introduced, instead of whether alternative methods were available.’ The
Respondent observes that in any event the Claimants failed to demonstrate the existence of such
alternatives.“” The Respondent did not abolish the 5% Break-Out Rule as of 2010, because it
purported to minimize the impact on existing investors.**” The Respondent did not tax on other
sectors because they had not received excessive profits from the RES support.**! The moratorium

period could not have been introduced earlier than February 2010, because it would have been

illegal under Czech and EU law.**

The Respondent argues that the investor that completes an investment after a measure is
announced cannot claim that at the time of the investment, it had legitimate expectations that

such a measure would not be adopted.*** In the present case, however, the power purchase

agreements of Usilné, Mozolov, and Oseéna operations were signed i
a. and a. all of which were even after the adoption of the

amendment measures."** Furthermore, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ characterization
that they had a “contractual” relationship under which the Respondent provided a promise of
stability as a bargain, stating that the Claimants did not incur any legal obligation to make
investment in the Czech Republic.*** It is the Respondent’s view that the FET and FPS claims

fail for these reasons.**°

The Respondent contends that Dr Géde made his investment decision without familiarizing
himself with the Czech photovoltaic legal framework, pointing out that during the hearing he

could not remember whether he had reviewed the Technical Regulation.**”

The Respondent, referring to AES v. Hungary and Electrabel v. Hungary, contends that a
violation of the non-impairment standard “requires the impairment caused by the discriminatory

39488

or unreasonable measure to be significant’ a high bar that, according to the Respondent,

“cannot be met by the mere imposition of a tax, or the simple denial of a tax exemption.”

The Respondent submits that, in the present case, the Claimants have not demonstrated any effect

or impact that rises to the level of “impairment” citing Perenco for support. The Respondent

notes that, as in Perenco, the Claimants remain free to use, and have in fact used, the so-called
“investments” to generate substantial revenues.*” In fact, the Claimants’ investment “continues
to earn returns that are above the benchmark of ‘adequate return’ established under the Act on
Promotion, and Claimants have failed to demonstrate that such returns are inadequate for a

regulated investment such as theirs”.“°!

The fact that the Claimants may have desired greater
profits than they have obtained does not in and of itself demonstrate “impairment”.*? The
Respondent submits that “investment treaties do not guarantee that every business projection will
be met” for “a State cannot be held liable for every single measure that might adversely affect an

investment’s value”.***

Additionally, the Respondent argues that even if the Claimants could demonstrate “impairment”,
they would have to also prove that such impairment “relates to the management, maintenance,
use, enjoyment, or disposal of the purported investments”.“”* According to the Respondent, this
follows from both the plain text of the relevant ECT and BIT provisions as well as the
interpretative principles of effet utile and expressio unius est exclusio alterius.”* The Respondent
notes that the Claimants do not attempt to argue that the amendment measures impaired any of
these activities.°° The Respondent submits that the Claimants’ contention that as a result of
these measures, their purported investments suffered “negative effects” is not sufficient.“””
Neither does the Respondent find convincing the Claimants’ argument that the measures reduced
the solar plants’ respective rates of return as such reduction has nothing to do with the
investment’s management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposal."

The Respondent submits that a host State’s policy is rational “if it had been adopted ‘following

a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter’” as

the AES tribunal stated.*”

The Respondent notes that “tribunals have been reluctant to question a State’s ‘discretionary
exercise of a sovereign power’ or to find a BIT violation simply because of a flaw in a given law
or a shortcoming in its implementation.”*” In the Respondent’s words, “tribunals have found a

wide range of policy objectives to be ‘rational’.*°!

In the present case, the Respondent maintains that its “objectives of reducing excessive profits,
balancing the budget, and sheltering consumers from excessive electricity price rises are

eminently rational”.*°

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ assertion as to the “rationality” requirement that “[i]t is
[...] incumbent upon [the Respondent] to prove that the maintenance of the Incentive Regime,
and the allegedly attendant high electricity prices, would have entailed the catastrophic
consequences for the Czech economy that are invoked, in terms of layoffs, plant shut downs and
dramatic drops in the tax revenues.”*°> The Claimants’ position would require the Respondent
to “prove that near-calamitous consequences would have occurred but for the State’s
intervention.” According to the Respondent, “tribunals have found policy objectives to be
‘rational’ without considering whether the circumstances meet a certain threshold of risk to the

State, or of overall gravity, in the absence of measures to address such policies.”°”°

obligation. The Respondent adds that “there is ‘a presumption of validity in favour of

legislative measures adopted by a State’”, relying on the EJ Paso award.*

In particular, with regard to a tax or fiscal measure at issue, the Respondent takes the view that
“several tribunals have held that a State’s imposition of a tax or other fiscal measure for the
purpose of regulating windfall profits is not ‘unreasonable’ under the non-impairment clause of

a BIT”, referring to Paushok v. Mongolia and AES v. Hungary”

The Respondent submits that the Claimants’ approach to the “reasonableness” element of the
non-impairment standard distorts the “reasonableness” test and its second prong of
proportionality.*"° The Respondent maintains that “tribunals are concerned not with the precise
magnitude of harm to the investor vis-a-vis the magnitude of benefit to the state, but rather with
whether the state measure is appropriate and justifiable in light of the public policy interest being

pursued”.*!!

In relation to the Claimants’ contention that “a state measure is only reasonable if, in addition to
pursuing a rational policy, its adverse effects on foreign investments are limited to what is strictly
necessary to achieve the public interest [...]”, the Respondent states that the Claimants distorted
the test as a strict scrutiny test and newly invented the phrase “strictly necessary”.°'? The

The Respondent asserts that it “acted reasonably at all times [...] by imposing appropriate and
proportional measures to correct the disequilibrium in the RES support regime” in response to
“an unforeseen influx of investment in the photovoltaic industry [and] “an unforeseen drop in
solar panel costs.”°'* According to the Respondent, in response to the unprecedented rise in PV
capacity and generation and the resulting increase in the RES subsidies and the final electricity
price, “it was entirely rational for the Czech Republic to craft measures aimed at correcting the
system and easing the burden on consumers.”*!* In addition, the Respondent submits that “the
Czech Republic also acted reasonably to rectify the good-faith mistake that had been made in the

The Respondent addresses the Claimants’ other arguments as to the reasonableness of the
amendment measures as follows.°”” First, the Respondent did not withdraw the essential features
of the Incentive Regime, because it continues to provide the FiT for the lifetime of the plants.°”*
The introduction of the Solar Levy was meant to restore a direct relationship between investments
and expected return, which should have been embedded from the beginning as an essential feature
of the regime.*™* Second, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ theory that the Czech Republic’s
repeal of the “consideration” to the investors provided a basis of the unreasonableness.°?> Such
a theory uplifts every contractual breach of a host State to a treaty violation.**° Third, the solar
boom was not caused by the Respondent’s mismanagement, but by investors’ behaviour of
rushing into the photovoltaic market toward the end of 2010.*°’ Even if there had been a better
solution, a State is not liable only because “circumstances develop in a less-than-ideal way.”**
Article 25.2(b) of the ILC Draft Articles, which the Claimants cite, is irrelevant to the present
case, since the Respondent does not plead a defence of necessity.*”? Fourth, the amendment
measures were not unprecedented bad practice.*” Rather, the measures were comparable to those
taken in other EU Member States.°*! In any event, whether a host State’s measures are novel or
whether there was a better solution is irrelevant to the unreasonableness analysis.°° Fifth, the

3. The Tribunal’s analysis

A. The Principles

360. As is usual in these cases, the Parties have adduced many published awards (in this case more

than 50) on the interpretation or application of the FET (‘fair and equitable treatment”) standard,
and the FPS (“full protection and security”) and non-impairment standards. Most of them are
well-known, and, although formulations of the principles differ in detail, it is only necessary to
summarize the present state of international law and practice in these general propositions

(several of which overlap with each other):

(1) There will be a breach of the FET standard where legal and business stability or the
legal framework has been altered in such a way as to frustrate legitimate and

reasonable expectations or guarantees of stability.**°

(2) A claim based on legitimate expectation must proceed from an identification of the
origin of the expectation alleged, so that its scope can be formulated with
precision.°*°

(6) Provisions of general legislation applicable to a plurality of persons or a category
of persons, do not create legitimate expectations that there will be no change in the

(7) An expectation may be engendered by changes to general legislation, but, at least
in the absence of a stabilization clause, they are not prevented by the fair and
equitable treatment standard if they do not exceed the exercise of the host State’s
normal regulatory power in the pursuance of a public interest and do not modify
the regulatory framework relied upon by the investor at the time of its investment

outside the acceptable margin of change.*”

(8) The requirements of legitimate expectations and legal stability as manifestations of
the FET standard do not affect the State’s rights to exercise its sovereign authority

to legislate and to adapt its legal system to changing circumstances.*"

(9) The host State is not required to elevate the interests of the investor above all other
considerations, and the application of the FET standard allows for a balancing or
weighing exercise by the State and the determination of a breach of the FET
standard must be made in the light of the high measure of deference which
international law generally extends to the right of national authorities to regulate

matters within their own borders.*

reasonable expectation, in this case, a representation of regulatory stability. It is irrelevant
whether the state in fact wished to commit itself; it is sufficient that it acted in a manner that
would reasonably be understood to create such an appearance. The element of reasonableness
cannot be separated from the promise, assurance or representation, in particular if the promise
is not contained in a contract or is otherwise stated explicitly. Whether a state has created a
legitimate expectation in an investor is thus a factual assessment which must be undertaken
in consideration of all the surrounding circumstances.

 

 
   

672. The Claimants must also have relied on that expectation when they made their
investments. However, it is not necessary for the entire investment to have been predicated
solely on such expectation. Businessmen do not invest on the basis of one single
consideration, no matter how important. In the Tribunal’s view, that expectation must be a
determining factor in an investor's decision to invest, or in the manner or magnitude of
its investments.

The Tribunal does not accept that it should approach this question simply on the basis of the

Claimants’ argument**>

that there is a free-standing obligation to provide a stable and predictable
investment framework. Nor does it accept the Respondent’s suggestion that no legitimate
expectations as to stability can arise in the absence of a legislative or contractual stabilization

arrangement.***

The Tribunal accepts that promises or representations to investors may be inferred from domestic
legislation in the context of its background, including official statements. It is not essential that
the official statements have legal force. There can be no doubt that both the Respondent and the
ERO described the incentive regime in terms of a guarantee or promise of stability, and that the
Czech Government actively promoted the new regime at home and abroad, and described its main

element in terms of a guarantee.

The documents which establish this have already been referred to, and it is only necessary to
mention that the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade, when submitting the bill to Parliament,
stated that one of the main objectives of the Act on Promotion was to establish a secure, stable
and predictable regime; the 2003 Explanatory Report on the Act on Promotion stated that the
support system was based “on providing a guarantee to investors”;*° the former Minister of
Environment stated that the most important principle of the law was the guarantee of a stable FiT
for a 15 year period;**° the Respondent in the 2005 UN Report described the purpose of Section
6(1)(b)(2) as: “providing guarantees to the investors and owners ... that ... revenue ...will be

372.

Nor can there be any doubt that investors such as the Claimants would have been well aware of
the political and economic issues which arose from the solar boom, and the history has been set

out above.**”

This phase culminated in the press release on August 24, 2009 in which the Ministry stated that
it was “planning to change the maximum 5% limit by which the ERO can reduce the purchase
price of electricity from renewable energy sources annually” and that it was “trying to ensure that

the new act comes into force on 1 January next year,”°°’i.e. in January 2010.

As the Claimants accept,*”' rumours of an intention to reduce incentives began in the summer of
2009, and that many officials, including current and former ministers, issued statements about

the problems of the solar boom.

On June 19, 2009, a major Czech newspaper reported in an article entitled “The state wants to
stop solar power plants boom” that “[s]olar energy support is starting to cause problems for the
state, which therefore wants to stop the ongoing solar boom. The solar electricity feed-in-tariff
has gone in some instances economically beyond the limit ... ERO is therefore seeking ways to
reduce the solar energy feed-in tariff dramatically. It is indeed extraordinarily attractive ...”.. Mr
Fiit was quoted as saying that the FiT had gone economically beyond the limit. The ERO was
trying to agree an amendment to the 5% cap on decreases with the Government and members of
Parliament, but the change would probably not come in 2009 because it would have to be debated
in Parliament, which would not be able to make a decision before autumn, when ERO had to

announce the tariffs for 2010.°

On June 24, 2009, an online article entitled “ERO is preparing purchase price reductions!”
reported that: “The Energy Regulatory Office (ERO) is preparing to dramatically reduce the
purchase prices of electricity produced from the sun by solar power plants. The reason for this is

the exceedingly high price of the sun’s energy ... Pursuant to the regulations in effect ERO cannot

together with the government to amend the existing regulations.”>*

Ina presentation of June 25, 2009 the Prague office of the law firm Schénherr referred to “efforts

to increase the percentage of decrease”.°*

In an interview published on August 13, 2009, Mr Kunz, Chairman of the Board of Energy 21,
referred to the 5% limit and said: “if the legislation changes, we must be ready for that. We cannot
have too many projects in which we work on the assumption that nothing will change.

Nevertheless, I don’t think the support will end entirely.”°°

On August 25, 2009, following the press release of August 24, 2009, an article under the headline
“Ministry of Industry and Trade wants to reduce support of solar power plants,” made reference
to “Business without any risk and with a state guarantee, and said that purchase prices were
guaranteed for 15 years while “thanks to current technologies, in some cases the payback period

of the investment is only about five years, the [Ministry of Trade and Industry] says.”*

On September 3, 2009, an article by P Gabal*®’ highlighted the Ministry’s statement that there
were 28 solar power plants in the Czech Republic in 2007, whereas there were 2,230 as at August
1, 2009, and reported that the Ministry wanted to change the 5% limit, ideally from January 1,
2010. Mr Kunz, the Chairman of Energy 21, was again quoted as counselling against abrupt

changes in the law because of investments already committed.

On November 2, 2009 under the heading “Additional payments for solar energy reached three
billion; the state may curtail their boom”,** it was said “... it seems now that solar power plants
will not be so lucrative anymore. The amendment being prepared by the Ministry of Finance and
planned to come into force early next year will likely not include the limit which allows a

decrease of the purchase price by not more than 5% every year.”

D. Dr Géde’s evidence

381.

382.

383.

384.

Dr Géde’s evidence was that he was personally involved in the investment in the Czech Republic.
In 2008 he had started contemplating entry into the energy market in the Czech Republic by
constructing photovoltaic installations. He first heard from specialized periodical magazines
dedicated to photovoltaic energy about the FiT incentive system implemented in the Czech

Republic in 2005, which was based on the earlier German experience with FiT.

After having made due inquiries, including many personal consultations with the Czech law firm
Po in Prague, he acquired extensive knowledge of the legal
framework of the incentive system, in particular of the Act on Promotion and of its implementing
regulations issued by the ERO. The fundamental incentive of that system was the fixed FiT
payable to renewable energy operators for the electricity produced over the expected lifetime of
the plant, which, in case of solar installations, was originally fixed by the ERO in 15 years and
then — by ERO Regulation 364/2007 — adjusted to 20 years. There was to be a stable FiT, subject
only to yearly increase in the range 2-4% based on the inflation index for industrial producers.
The Act on Promotion also provided that FiT payable to photovoltaic plants put into operation in
any given year could not be more than 5% lower than those granted to photovoltaic plants put

into operation in the previous year.

He said*”* that he was told y\ ET that the fundamental innovation

and guarantee of the system was the long-term stability of the FiT level, as compared with the
previous system. He went through every piece of legislation, but does not remember receiving
any written advice, although he spent days discussing the Czech legal framework. During those
consultations he was assured that once put into operation a solar panel would receive the FiT set
for that year by the ERO for its lifetime, and he was reassured that the plant would benefit from
a tax holiday in the year in which it was put into operation and for the following five years. He
was never advised of a risk that the Czech Republic could have reneged on its commitments by

introducing retroactive measures affecting the guaranteed 6 year tax vacation.

In addition®*” he recalled an intensive promotion of the system by Czech officials, and there were
many articles in local newspapers and the specialized press explaining the fundamental pillars of
the promotion and showing that the new system from 2008 was capable of attracting the RES

investments needed by the Czech Republic. He refers to a Report prepared by the Ministry of

Industry and the ERO*”* which stated that the Act on Promotion provided a “guarantee of long-
term and stable promotion” and referred to “the guarantee of revenues per unit of electricity
produced.”*”” He says that he received clear reassurances from documents produced by the ERO
which he studied at the time, including a “Q&A tool” available in German on the ERO’s website,
which stated that the FiT had to remain stable for the expected lifetime of solar plants.**” The
Q&A has a Question 9: for what period are FiTs “guaranteed”? The table gives 20 years for

photovoltaic plants.**!

He was equally aware of the incentives in the Act on Income Tax and relied on them when he

took the final decision to invest in the Czech Republic.

At the time of his investment, he did not doubt the reliability of the incentive system because he
was aware that the Czech Republic needed RES investments to reach the EU targets. In addition,
the State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic, prepared by the Ministry of Industry and Trade
and approved by the Czech Government in March 2004, confirmed the Czech Republic's
favourable attitude to attract RES investments setting a long-term goal of 15-16% of energy
production from RES by 2030. The Act on Promotion purported to establish a stable and

predictable investment scenario for RES producers.

He remembered that the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the ERO engaged in a strong
promotion of the Czech RES system with the aim of attracting investments. Between 2006 and
2009, the ERO's website published several presentations on the incentive regime confirming his

understanding of it.

Based on the estimates of the costs to set up solar plants and on the guarantees under the incentive
regime, primarily the FiT one, he made the calculations to assess the profitability of the solar

investment in the Czech Republic.

Before constructing the second plant, he had extensive practical knowledge of the incentive
system. Before making further investments he wanted to obtain (and obtained) a direct
confirmation of the reliability of the Czech environment in general and of the FiT regime in

particular.

Dr Géde was aware of the discussions about the possibility of adjusting the RES support system,
and the level of FiT. Those discussions, however, focused exclusively on prospective changes
for new investors in the market and, in particular, on the possibility of removing the 5% limit on
the ERO's power to set the level of FiT. The final outcome of those discussions was the change
in legislation, which was adopted in May 2010 and targeted exclusively investors setting up
photovoltaic plants after January 1, 2011. To the best of his knowledge, no one had ever
contemplated amendments to the FiT system affecting the level of incentives granted to

existing investors.

From an investor perspective, therefore, the legislative amendment in May 2010 did not put into
question the reliability of the RES incentive system because it introduced modifications for new

investors only. It was a simple evolution of the Czech law supporting RES investments.

From Dr Géde’s point of view, it was perfectly conceivable that the Czech Republic could decide
to amend the then existing level of incentive for newcomers in the market. Conversely, it was
completely unpredictable to contemplate the adoption by the Czech Republic of measures
impacting on investments already made. The forward-looking legislative amendment of May
2010 precisely pointed to the Czech Republic's intention not to alter the system for existing

investors, as it was absolutely reasonable to expect.

Following the May 2010 amendment, Dr Géde was encouraged to complete the pending projects
within the deadline for obtaining subsidies under the original incentive system, i.e. December 31,
2010. Had the Czech Republic spelled out clearly that the original incentives could be modified
also for photovoltaic plants connected in 2009 and 2010, he would have abandoned the ongoing

projects, seeking simply to recover the expenses already incurred.

In cross-examination Dr Géde said that at the time of his investment he read through the entire
Act on Promotion, and the Q&A in German on the ERO website (which was the most important
582

for him**”). He could not recall whether he had read the Technical Regulation.***

He did not ask any questions of the ERO before making the investment about any aspect of the
regime because once there was an Act he was not going to ask for an interpretation.*** He did
not commission any due diligence because he relied on his staff or i. who had been
a banker and had been working in the solar industry, and wi who used to work for a Czech

installations; he read articles about the solar boom, and continued after the initial investment was
made to monitor the press for developments in the Czech solar industry.**° He was aware of a

FiT was extraordinarily attractive and that amendments to the legal regime were being
contemplated.*** He had a close look at the developments.**” They were a bit insecure about
investing. But in October-November 2009 there was a declaration made by the ERO or the Czech
Government and an interview with the Minister of Industry, in which the 5% reduction would
only be done as of January 1, 2011. If it had changed by October 2010 they would not have
continued investing.’ In re-examination he was shown the proposal in November 2009 for
amendment. He had read it and it made clear that their investment would be secure until 2011. It

gave them comfort that the product line could remain the way it was.**

As already indicated, the Tribunal accepts the Claimants’ case that to establish a legitimate
expectation, there is no requirement that there be an express stabilisation provision, and that it is
sufficient for the Claimants to establish an express or implied promise giving rise to a legitimate

and reasonable expectation of stability.

The essential question is whether the combination of (1) the promotion of the Incentive Regime
in its early days as a guarantee and (2) the deliberate non-retroactivity of the abolition of the 5%
cap by Act 137/2010 for solar plants connected to the grid from 2011 and the abolition of the
support by Act 330/2010 from March 1, 2011, gave rise to a legitimate expectation by solar
investors in 2010 that there would be no other changes which would affect their investment. For
this purpose, for the reasons given above, the imposition of the Solar Levy is to be treated as such

a change.

(i) The investments

It is important to have in mind the dates when the plants were built and commissioned. The
HolySov plant was commissioned on December 18, 2008. It was not affected by the Solar Levy
or the repeal of the tax incentives. But the Claimants maintain a claim in respect of the plant on
the basis that the Respondent’s measures increased uncertainty in the solar energy investment
environment, which indirectly caused a negative impact on the HolySov SPV’s enterprise

value."

The Respondent says that the claim in respect of the Mozolov plant is not maintainable because

 

its operating licence was obtained in bad faith after submitting falsified reports, and was annulled

by the Czech administrative courts.**

originally intended to apply to solar plants commissioned from 2010, but eventually adopted by

Act 137/2010 and applied only to plants commissioned from 2011. The complete abolition was

effected by Act 330/2010, and took effect from March 1, 2011.

There can be no doubt that from 2009 the Respondent was entitled to take the view that the price

of energy was seriously distorted by the solar boom, and it was clear, or should have been clear,
to any informed observer that it was common currency in the trade press and elsewhere that the
Respondent wished to take steps to reduce the FiT, and that the original plan announced in the

press release of August 24, 2009 was to reduce it from 2010.

Subsequently, when the proposals to amend the Act on Promotion were crystallized, the
Government made it clear that it was not to be retroactive, so that investors could prepare in

advance, and thus the risk of lawsuits against the Government would be minimized.

On September 8, 2009 in an open letter to the Chairman of the Economic Committee of the
Chamber of Deputies Mr Fiit proposed an amendment to the Act on Promotion to enable the
ERO to lower the incentives, subject to “ensuring a reasonable vacatio legis period in the form
of an interim provision which shall read: “The Office shall proceed for the first time in accordance
with Clause 6, paragraph 4 ... when setting the purchase prices for 2011.” The proposed
amendment pursued the following aim (among others): “Investors will be able to prepare
sufficiently in advance for the change in the conditions for investing which should eliminate
entirely the risk of possible lawsuits in the Czech Republic regarding protection of

investments.”°°°

On November 16, 2009 the Government put forward a proposal to amend Act 180/2005.°° The
Explanatory Report said, in line with Mr Fiit’s proposal, that the aims of the legislation were
as follows:
© The proposed wording would enable the Office to adjust the prices for solar power to
bring them in line with the principles used for other types of renewable resources as of

1 January 2011, which will eliminate the current discrimination against other types of
renewable sources.

 

e Investors may prepare sufficiently in advance for amendment of the conditions for
investment, which should entirely eliminate the risk of potential lawsuits against the
Czech Republic related to protection of investments.

 

© In the soonest upcoming period (2011), overpayment for solar power from end
customers will be limited.

 

e After the purchase prices become more realistic, the operators of distribution systems
and the operator of the grid will have relevant requirements for investments into the
power network. Today's exorbitant requirements are leading to investments of tens of
billions of CZK, which have been reflected in regulated prices for end customers.

During a press conference on the same day,”

the Minister of Industry and Trade, Mr Vladimir
ToSovsky, said that: “The change consists of the ERO having an option to adjust the feed-in tariff
so that it would reflect the costs and the required return from 2011, which is important” and “the
promotion stays as it is for 2010.” He was asked by Czech Television: “You mentioned reduction
of the promotion from 2011. Why 2011?”, to which he replied:
It is because some projects are currently under way and the investors or bank have already
invested in them. If we did this, it would mean changing the terms and conditions under

which they invested in the course of the development, which could pose a threat to their
investment. That is why it is 2011.

The point that investment in 2010 would not be affected was taken up by specialists. In a German
language article of December 16, 2009 entitled “An ‘all-clear’ for Investors” by members of the

Renewable Energy team at the Czech law firm Ueltzhéffer Balada, it was said:

Investors in the photovoltaic industry can thus largely be given the “all-clear”. The proposed
new provision changes nothing for facilities that connect to the network before the end of
2010. For those facilities, the prices of 23 November 2009, set by the regulator, will still
apply. In subsequent years of operation, the reduction in feed-in tariffs will remain limited to
5 percent as before. There is thus about a year left to complete and connect a project in order
to benefit from the already fixed prices.

 

    

From the point of view of both investors and lawyers, the proposed law sends a positive
signal in terms of investment and protection of legitimate expectations. The current tariffs,
which are still very high, will not bring investors much in the long term if they are highly
controversial and so create a permanent risk of a change in the law. With this bill, the
government has finally made a clear statement regarding the future development possibilities
for photovoltaics in the Czech Republic.

 

 

     

 

The Respondent now says that the main reason for postponing abolition of the 5% limit until
2011 was to avoid harming projects that were already in progress (but could not be completed in

2009) — not to give licence for even more investors (like the Claimants) to pile in.

The Respondent says that solar investors, including the Claimants, took advantage of the non-
retroactivity of the change in the Act on Promotion, and used the delay to commission an
unexpectedly massive number of new solar installations, with the result that more than half of
the solar generation capacity in the Czech Republic today was brought online in the last three

months of 2010.°”

Mr Jones’ evidence was that “approximately 1,200 MW of capacity was commissioned in the

last three months of 2010 alone.”*! He says that this development could not have been predicted
with accuracy before mid-2010: “[T]he fact that most of the installed capacity was commissioned
at the very end of 2010 suggests that the ERO did not receive the relevant license applications
until relatively late in 2010 and so the Government could not have been certain, even in mid-
2010, as to the amount of installed capacity that would be commissioned in 2010. I therefore
completely disagree with Claimant’s suggestion that it would have been straightforward to

calculate the financial impact of the solar boom prior to the end of the year.”°"!

(iti) The Solar Levy

There is no doubt that the mechanism of a tax was introduced to avoid claims by investors,
especially foreign investors. Thus the minutes of the meeting of October 15, 2010 of the
Coordination Committee promoted by the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade sate: “1 Deputy
Environmental Minister Ms Bizkova stated that is necessary to find a formally correct mechanism
for reduction of the support of RES from photovoltaic power plants, such that it cannot be legally
contested. ... Chairman of ERO Mr J Fiit declared that the ERO fully supports the legally strong
variant, which shall ensure the reduction of the contribution to the PVPPs [photovoltaic

power producers].”°!

As already indicated, the point that investment in 2010 would not be affected was taken up by
specialists, with the result that in a German language article of December 16, 2009 entitled “An
‘all-clear’ for Investors”°'? by members of the Renewable Energy team at the Czech law firm
Ueltzhéffer Balada, it was said that “there is thus about a year left to complete and connect a

project in order to benefit from the already fixed prices.”

The Government was obviously concerned about the prospect of lawsuits, including claims by

foreign investors under investment treaties, as was the Coordination Committee.*!*

In his September 8, 2009 open letter to the Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Chamber
of Deputies Mr Fiit said: “Investors will be able to prepare sufficiently in advance for the change

in the conditions for investing which should eliminate entirely the risk of possible lawsuits in the

Czech Republic regarding protection of investments.”*'* The Government’s proposal of
November 16, 2009°'° to amend the Act on Promotion said that one of its aims was to eliminate

the risk of investor protection litigation.

It does not follow that any such claims would have succeeded, but it is clear that fear of them did

lead the Government to adopt the device of the Solar Levy.

It was clear from mid-2010 that the Government might resort to taxation measures to deal with
the solar boom, and statements to that effect by the Prime Minister, Minister of Industry and

Trade, and the Minister of Environment were widely reported.

On July 23, 2010, the Minister of Environment was quoted in article entitled “The Minister of
Environment wants to tax solar power plants” as saying: “The only instrument we have for the
existing contracts is the fiscal instrument. I can imagine in these circumstances that some form
of taxation could help to make the purchasing prices realistic ... This issue must be solved as a

matter of urgency, because it is over economic means of this country and its citizens.”°"”

On July 30, 2010, a newspaper reported under the headline “Solar boom is over” that the
speculative sale of solar power plant projects was over, and that there was speculation in the

market concerning a 30% reduction in the support and a special tax.°'*

On August 27, 2010 the Prime Minister was quoted in an article as saying that “We must suppress
the solar business. Also with the help of taxes ...” The State would intervene effectively but
“primarily has to avoid arbitrations and litigations” but the government would try to reduce the

attractiveness of the photovoltaic busines:

 

: “The range of steps includes also tax considerations.

I deem it fundamental to say that we do not want to neglect it.” °"”

On September 16, 2010, the Minister of Industry and Trade was quoted in an article which began
“The government is still obscure on how to restrict solar power plants this year. The fairest idea
is to tax them” and saying, after a reference to the option to tax the producers: “If we [were] to

tax the contribution, the support represented in the price of electricity will remain the same for

the consumer.”°”?

The Tribunal accepts that the Solar Levy was a transparent device to avoid what the Respondent
had been advised might cause investor claims. That is clear from the minutes the Coordination

Committee.! But, in common with the Czech Constitutional Court,°”

and the European
Commission’s Decision on state aid, the Tribunal does not consider that the modifications to
the support scheme and the tax measures were retroactive, and considers that they did not violate

the principle of legitimate expectation.

The Tribunal’s view is that Dr Géde was essentially an opportunistic investor who saw a window
of opportunity and who was aware, or should have been aware, that dealing with the solar boom

was a fast-moving and controversial political issue.

The Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s case that there is no evidence of any real due diligence
by Dr Géde. The only documentary evidence of advice ion IZ _
are some invoices (totalling approximately EUR , hone of which specifies the nature of
legal services provided, and originate from the law firm and lawyer (Ms |

responsible for the Claimants’ commercial transactions during the relevant period.

He of course knew of, and endeavoured to take advantage of, the fact that the 5% limit had been
removed only from 2011. But he was also aware that the Czech Government had been deeply
concerned about the effect of the solar boom from 2009 and should have been aware that other
legislative changes, especially with regard to tax, were in the air. The Claimants had avoided the
February 2010 moratorium by taking assignments of the binding statements in relation to three

of their largest projects.

The Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s case that the market which the Claimants were entering
was a bubble and that the Czech Government considered that the FiT regime was out of balance
and that would have been obvious to anyone who participated in industry discussions, or paid

attention to warnings by specialist professionals, or read the local press.

The Tribunal considers that Dr Géde’s actions were essentially opportunistic, and that the

investment protection regime was never intended to promote and safeguard those who, in the

words of the Respondent, “pile in” to take advantage of laws which they must know may be in a
state of flux caused essentially by investors of that type. In the words of the Respondent, the

Claimants had “a speculative hope — as opposed to an internationally-protected expectation.”°*

The abolition of the tax exemption is not at the forefront of the Claimants’ case, since the material
on which the claim of legitimate expectation is based is very thin, and consists of little more than
a statement in the Explanatory Report in November 2003 of an early draft of the Act on
Promotion that the promotion system was based on maintaining (inter alia) “the tax reliefs to the
extent set out in the Acts on Income Tax ...”.° It is true that an expert appointed by the Czech
Government, Professor Dr Gerloch gave an opinion®* that under Czech law the removal of the

exemption would be regarded as retrospective and unlawful, but the Czech Constitutional Court

ly upheld the 1 of the tax exemption.” In the view of the Tribunal, the

Respondent is right to argue that investors did not have a legitimate expectation that the 5-year
tax exemption was a guarantee that it could not be subject to legislative amendment within that

period.

Investors know that the legislative framework may change and evolve in the light of
circumstances and of political developments. It is not every change which gives rise to a claim

based on breach of legitimate expectation.

It is also necessary to mention the Respondent’s argument that in any event the Claimants had no
expectation of a WACC in excess of 7%. There is a dispute as to the significance of the 7%
figure. According to the Respondent, until the end of 2010, the WACC level used by the ERO in
calculating the FiTs for the purpose of section 4 of the Technical Regulation was 7% per
annum, © and it shows that the Claimants could only have expected to achieve a 15-year payback

period for capital expenditures and a 7% rate of return.°”?

The Claimants accept that the Respondent did respect the 15-year simple payback and the 7%

return, but say that this is irrelevant because the fact that the ERO used 7% as an internal method

(or benchmark) for calculating the FiTs cannot be invoked to assess what profits investors were
promised and were entitled to receive, and the crucial figures are the levels of FiT set each year.”
The Respondent accepts that the return level did not operate as a cap on profits, but functioned

as the baseline assumption applicable to setting the FiT.°"!

The Tribunal is of the view that an informed investor who had undertaken proper diligence would
have been aware of the use by the ERO of the 7% benchmark. A presentation by the Prague office
of the regional law firm Schénherr entitled “Legal Aspects of Photovoltaic Power Plant
Implementation” was aimed at solar investors and explained that the tariffs “reflect typical
investment and operating costs of the projects and lifetime of the installations so that the revenues
cover the expenditures + bring 7% profit . . .”°°? Press reports in 2009 discussed excessive rates
of return for solar installations and cited 7% as the ERO benchmark.®*? But in the light of the
Tribunal’s main conclusion, it is not necessary to come to a final conclusion on the effect of the

Claimants’ knowledge that the ERO’s policy was to use a 7% WACC.

In the view of the Tribunal, the Claimants’ complaint of impairment by arbitrary and

unreasonable conduct also fails.

The Claimants accept that there was an undesired expansion of RES plants in many countries,

but they say®*

that the Czech measures were unreasonable and arbitrary and that some EU
Member States were able to limit the undesired expansion of RES investments by means of sound
regulatory and non-retroactive practices which did not betray the legitimate expectations of RES
investors, especially Germany, Portugal, France, Austria, Denmark, The Netherlands, and
Slovenia. They argue that the retrospective changes were “regulatory opportunism”, consisting
in reducing regulated payments after the initial investments are already made. The burden of the
incentive regime was not higher than that of similar regimes in other EU Member States. In any
event, even if hypothetically the increase in the cost of electricity were viewed as excessive, that

increase was easily predictable and was simply the price that the Respondent committed to pay

to reach the 8% target fixed by the EU.

The Tribunal accepts that the Solar Levy was designed (unnecessarily, in the view of the
Tribunal) to disguise abolition of the 5% limit. But it was adopted as part of a package of
measures which (1) introduced a State budget subsidy to limit the rise in consumer electricity
prices caused, in large part, by the solar boom, and (2) sought to offset this new budget
expenditure with new tax revenues. The Solar Levy was specifically targeted at those solar
installations that received a FiT which was excessive. The Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s
case that for purposes of the reasonableness analysis, it does not matter whether a tribunal
believes that a particular course of action is “good” or “bad,” that a different solution might have

been “better,” or that a State could have done “more,” or that other States took different measures.

The Tribunal accepts that the Respondent had the rational objective of reducing excessive profits
and sheltering consumers from excessive electricity price rises, and that its actions were not
arbitrary or irrational. There was an appropriate correlation between the Respondent’s objectives
and the measures it took. There is nothing irrational or unreasonable about the imposition of a
charge to regulate what the Respondent reasonably regarded as windfall profits and to reduce the
impact on consumers, and the measures, which applied only to the most recent installations and
therefore the ones able to earn the profits as a result of the decline in PV costs, were not

disproportionate.

The measures dealt with a pressing problem caused by the late entry of many investors (mainly
domestic) seeking to take advantage of an incentive regime which was bound to change. All that
the measures did was to reduce the rate of return to a level which the State had originally intended.
It is true in this context also that the Respondent resorted to the device of the Solar Levy instead
of a change to the 5% limit in the FiT, but in the view of the Tribunal that does not alter the

essential fact that the measures were rational and proportionate. The effect on the Claimants was

  

that they would have an investment payback ing years and a rate of return of between] fo

and five. On Dr Géde’s original calculations, the effect was a reduction in profits from

i euros o ii euros over the life of the investment.°*°

Consequently, in the view of the Tribunal, there was neither an impairment of the investment,

nor the use of unreasonable or irrational or arbitrary measures.

X. Other issues

In the light of the Tribunal’s conclusions on the merits, it follows that these issues do not arise:
(1) whether compliance by the Respondent with an award of the Tribunal would be a state aid;
(2) whether illegality barred the claim in relation to the Mozolov plant; (3) whether there was a

prima facie case in relation to the HolySov plant; and (4) the quantum of damages.

The claims are therefore dismissed.

Claimants’ Schedule of Cos

The effect of Articles 10(2) and 9(5) of the BIT and Article 40 of the UNCITRAL 1976 Rules is
that the costs of arbitration are in principle to be borne by the unsuccessful party, but the Tribunal
may apportion costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking

into account the circumstances of the case.

The Claimants have prevailed on one important issue, namely the ECT tax carve-out objection,

but have failed on the merits.

The Claimants claimed their costs in the amount of hi including their share of the

fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the PCA.°”

The Respondent claimed its costs of and in addition its share of the fees and expenses
of the Tribunal and the PCA.°*

Accordingly, in very broad terms the Claimants claim q million and the Respondent claims a

million.

In the light of the Tribunal’s conclusion that the Claimants succeeded on the issue of the tax
carve-out but failed on the merits, the Claimants’ primary submission is that they should be
awarded the costs of this arbitration, relating to the Respondent’s objections to the jurisdiction,
but should not bear any of the Respondent’s costs relating to the merits because the Claimants
brought bona fide claims, while the Respondent, among others, raised the unnecessary EU State

aid issue.

As regards quantum, the Claimants say that they ran the case with a small legal team (much

smaller than the Respondent’s team), relied upon expert evidence only where strictly necessary,

and, divided essentially all costs with the other eight Claimants with which it sought to bring a
single multi-party arbitration. The Claimants say that if the Respondent’s legal costs exceed
those of the Claimants, such an amount would not be “reasonable”, given that the Claimants bore

the burden of proof as to most of the issues.

The Respondent submits that the costs should be allocated in accordance with the principle that
the costs follow the event, and that its costs were reasonable. It should be entitled to its costs even
if the Claimants were to prevail on some of the issues, because the Claimants caused an

unnecessary aggravation of costs.

The Claimants have requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to bear the costs occasioned
by the postponement of the hearin i iii 6 The Respondent
says that no special order is required because it was an unforeseen event outside the Respondent’s

control.

The Parties deposited with the PCA a total of GBP] (GBP by the Claimant; GBP
| | by the Respondent) to cover the costs of arbitration.

The fees of Mr Gary Born, the arbitrator appointed by the Claimants, amount to capa
His expenses amount to corm. The fees of Judge Peter Tomka, the arbitrator appointed

arbitrator, amount to copa His expenses amount to cop.

services amount to cap Other Tribunal costs, including court reporters, interpreters,

travel, bank charges, and all other expenses relating to the arbitration proceedings, amount to

Based on the above figures, the combined Tribunal costs, comprising the items covered in

Article 38 (a), (b) and (c) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, as enumerated above, are fixed

matter.
In the exercise of its discretion in the light of Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal
takes these matters into account: (1) the Respondent prevailed on the merits; (2) the Claimants

succeeded on the issue of the tax carve-out; (3) it is reasonable to make some allowance for the

Claimants’ costs in relation to the adjournment.

In the light of all these considerations, the Tribunal’s conclusion on legal and arbitration costs is
that the Respondent should be awarded usa in legal costs, and that the Claimants

should bear three-quarters of the arbitration costs.

Operative part

The Claimants’ claims are dismissed.

The Claimants shall pay to the Respondent within 28 days of delivery of this award the sum of
