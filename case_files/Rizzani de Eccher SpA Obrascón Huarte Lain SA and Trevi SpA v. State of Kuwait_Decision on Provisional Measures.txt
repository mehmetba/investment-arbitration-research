INTRODUCTION

This decision addresses and rules upon the Claimants’ Request for Provisional
Measures filed on 12 April 2017 (“Claimants’ Application’), as well as the
Respondent's Request for Provisional Measures filed on 21 June 2017

(‘Respondent's Application’) (collectively, the “Applications’).

The Claimants are Rizzani de Eccher S.p.A. (“Rizzani”), Obrascén Huarte Lain S.A.
(‘OHL”) and Trevi S.p.A. (“Trevi”). Rizzani and Trevi are corporations incorporated
under the laws of the Italian Republic.’ OHL is a corporation incorporated under the

laws of the Kingdom of Spain.?
The Respondent is the State of Kuwait.

The Claimants and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the

“Parties”.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

On 7 February 2017, the Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration against the
Respondent with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes

(“‘ICSID”).

In their Request for Arbitration, the Claimants alleged that the Respondent’s conduct
in relation to their purported investment violated a number of provisions under the
Agreement between the Italian Republic and State of Kuwait for the Promotion and

Company Registration Report of Rizzani, Exhibit C-4; Company Registration Report of Trevi, Exhibit C-
6.

Notarial Deed and Bylaws of OHL, Exhibit C-5.

Protection of Investments of 17 December 1987 and its Protocol of the same date
(‘Italy-Kuwait BIT’)° and the Agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the
State of Kuwait for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments of

8 September 2005 (“Spain-Kuwait BIT’)‘ (collectively, the “BITs”).

The Claimants also expressly requested, in their Request for Arbitration, to submit a
formal request for provisional measures as a matter of urgency after the registration

of the request.>

On 3 March 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for
Arbitration in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and Rules 6 and 7

of the ICSID Institution Rules, and notified the Parties of the registration of the case.

On 12 April 2017, the Claimants submitted their Request for Provisional Measures,
together with accompanying factual exhibits and legal authorities. By a letter dated
13 April 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID decided that the briefing schedule
would be as follows: (a) Respondent’s Response to the Request to be filed by
26 April 2017; (b) Claimants’ Reply to be filed by 10 May 2017; and (c) Respondent's

Rejoinder to be filed by 24 May 2017.

On 20 April 2017, the Respondent requested that the briefing schedule be extended
by two weeks to account for, among other matters, the Respondent's Counsel’s
recent appointment to the case. By letter dated 24 April 2017, the Claimants took
issue with the Respondent's reasons for the extension but consented to the

extension of the briefing schedule as requested by the Respondent. Accordingly, the

Legal Authority CL-1.
Legal Authority CL-2.
Claimants’ Request for Arbitration dated 7 February 2017 at [183].

Secretary-General of ICSID revised the briefing schedule on 25 April 2017 as follows:
(a) Respondent's Response to the Claimants’ Request for Provisional Measures to
be filed by 10 May 2017; (b) Claimants’ Reply to be filed by 24 May 2017; and (c)

Respondent's Rejoinder to be filed by 7 June 2017.

In paragraphs 219 to 223 of their Request for Arbitration, the Claimants made a
proposal to the Respondent regarding the number of arbitrators and the method of
their appointment. By a letter dated 20 April 2017, the Respondent confirmed that the
Parties were in agreement that the Tribunal would be composed of three arbitrators,
that each Party would appoint a co-arbitrator, and that the President of the Tribunal

would be designated by agreement of the Parties.

By a letter dated 6 March 2017, the Claimants appointed Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov as
arbitrator. ICSID informed the Parties of Dr. Alexandrov’s acceptance of his

appointment by a letter dated 8 May 2017.

In accordance with the revised briefing schedule as approved by the Secretary-
General, the Respondent filed its Response to the Claimants’ Request for Provisional
Measures on 10 May 2017, together with accompanying factual exhibits and legal
authorities. The Claimants subsequently filed their Reply on their Request for
Provisional Measures on 24 May 2017, together with accompanying factual exhibits

and legal authorities.

By a letter dated 1 June 2017, the Respondent appointed Professor Zachary
Douglas QC as arbitrator. ICSID informed the Parties of Professor Douglas QC’s

acceptance of his appointment by a letter dated 7 June 2017.

By a letter dated 2 June 2017, the Respondent requested a two-week extension to
file its Rejoinder to the Claimants’ Request for Provisional Measures, which was due
to be filed on 7 June 2017. In its letter, the Respondent alleged, among other things,
that it was only in the Claimants’ Reply filed on 24 May 2017 that the Claimants
revealed for the first time that Rizzani had filed an action in the domestic court in
Milan, Italy on 10 February 2017, and apparently obtained an ex parte order on
13 February 2017 for provisional measures. The Respondent further stated in its
letter that it would also seek provisional measures from the Tribunal ordering the
Claimants to withdraw the Italian court actions and enjoining them from commencing
any other such proceedings. On 5 June 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID
granted the Respondent's request and directed that the Respondent submit its

Rejoinder on 21 June 2017.

On 21 June 2017, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder to the Claimants’ Request
for Provisional Measures and its Request for Provisional Measures, together with:
(a) a witness statement of Mr John Andrew Faulkner; and (b) accompanying factual

exhibits and legal authorities.

Further to the Respondent's Request for Provisional Measures filed on 21 June
2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID established the following briefing schedule in
accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(5): (a) Claimants’ Response to the
Respondent’s Request for Provisional Measures to be filed by 6 July 2017;
(b) Respondent's Reply to be filed within two weeks from the date of receipt of the
Claimants’ Response; and (c) Claimants’ Rejoinder to be filed within two weeks from

the date of receipt of the Respondent's Reply.

By a letter dated 5 July 2017, the Claimants objected to the Respondent's Application
and requested that the Tribunal first rule on the Claimants’ Application before turning

to any remaining aspects of the Respondent’s Application. By a letter dated 28 July
2017, the Respondent replied to the Claimants’ letter dated 5 July 2017 and asked
that the Tribunal consider the Respondent's Application simultaneously with the
Claimants’ Application. The Claimants responded to the Respondent's letter on

4 August 2017.

On 5 July 2017, the Parties jointly filed a request for the Chairman of the ICSID
Administrative Council (“Chairman”) to appoint an arbitrator to be President of the
Tribunal pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4(1) of the ICSID

Arbitration Rules.

By a letter dated 24 July 2017, ICSID invited the Parties to consider five candidates
for appointment as presiding arbitrator pursuant to ICSID’s practice and with a view
to promoting the appointment of mutually agreeable arbitrators, and stated that the
Chairman would appoint the President of the Tribunal should this ballot procedure

fail.

On 31 July 2017, both Parties submitted their completed ballots to ICSID.

On 2 August 2017, ICSID informed the Parties that they had failed to reach an
agreement, and that ICSID would therefore proceed with the appointment of the
President of the Tribunal in accordance with Articles 38 and 40(1) of the ICSID
Convention. The letter further stated that it was their intention to propose to the

Chairman the appointment of Mr. Cavinder Bull SC as the presiding arbitrator.

As ICSID did not receive any observations from the Parties on the appointment of

Mr. Cavinder Bull SC as the presiding arbitrator, ICSID informed the Parties on

24.

25.

26.

27.

10 August 2017 that the Chairman would proceed to appoint Mr. Cavinder Bull SC

and would notify the Parties once the Tribunal is constituted.

By a letter dated 11 August 2017, ICSID informed the Parties that the Tribunal was
constituted, that the proceeding was deemed to have begun on that day and that Mr.

Benjamin Garel, ICSID Legal Counsel, would serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.

On 18 August 2017, the Tribunal established a new briefing schedule in respect of
the Respondent's Application as follows: (a) Claimants’ Response to the
Respondent's Request for Provisional Measures to be filed by 4 September 2017;
(b) Respondent's Reply to be filed within two weeks from the date of receipt of the
Claimants’ Response (i.e. 18 September 2017); and (c) Claimants’ Rejoinder to be
filed within two weeks from the date of receipt of the Respondent's Reply (i.e.

2 October 2017).

By a letter dated 31 August 2017, the Claimants requested a 10-day extension to file
their Response to the Respondent's Request for Provisional Measures (i.e. until
14 September 2017), arguing that the Respondent requested and obtained two
extensions of time of 14 days each to file its Response and its Rejoinder to the
Claimants’ Request for Provisional Measures. The Respondent objected to the

Claimants’ request by a letter dated 1 September 2017.

By a letter dated 4 September 2017, the Claimants withdrew their request for an
extension of time to submit their Response to the Respondent’s Request for
Provisional Measures, on the understanding that the Respondent will comply with the
calendar set forth by the Tribunal and will communicate its availability for a hearing

by the next day, at the latest. On the same day, the Claimants submitted their

Response to the Respondent’s Request for Provisional Measures, together with

accompanying factual exhibits and legal authorities.

On 11 September 2017, the Respondent requested a two-week extension to file its
Reply to its Request for Provisional Measures, which was due to be filed on
18 September 2017. By a letter dated 14 September 2017, the Claimants objected to

the Respondent's request.

On 15 September 2017, the Tribunal granted the Respondent's request for an
extension of time. The Tribunal stated that it was mindful that the extension of time
would not affect the hearing dates or more generally delay the proceedings, and it
also noted that no prejudice resulting from the requested extension has been
specified. The Tribunal thus directed that the Respondent's Reply to its Request for
Provisional Measures be filed by 2 October 2017 at the latest and the Claimants’

Rejoinder by 18 October 2017 at the latest.

On 2 October 2017, the Respondent submitted its Reply to its Request for
Provisional Measures, together with: (a) the second witness statement of Mr John

Andrew Faulkner; and (b) accompanying factual exhibits and legal authorities.

By a letter dated 4 October 2017, the Claimants requested an extension of time
identical to that granted to the Respondent, and to file their Rejoinder on or before
30 October 2017. On 6 October 2017, the Respondent objected to the
Claimants’ request, arguing that as the hearing on provisional measures was set to
begin on 3 November 2017 and if the Claimants were to file their Rejoinder on
30 October 2017, that would leave only three intervening days to review their

submissions which would impair the Respondent's ability to prepare for the hearing.

On 7 October 2017, the Tribunal granted the Claimants an extension until 27 October

2017 to file their Rejoinder on the Respondent's Request for Provisional Measures.

On 27 October 2017, the Claimants submitted their Rejoinder on the Respondent's
Request for Provisional Measures, together with accompanying factual exhibits and

legal authorities.

The hearing on provisional measures was held in Paris, France on 3 and

4 November 2017 (“Hearing”).

FACTUAL BACKGROUND AS PRESENTED BY THE CLAIMANTS

For the purposes of this decision, the Tribunal sets out below a brief summary of the
factual background asserted by the Claimants in their Request for Arbitration.® The
Tribunal makes no determinations in relation to the Claimants’ assertions at this

stage.

According to the Request for Arbitration, in 2010, the Respondent began the
tendering process for a large infrastructure project for the construction, completion
and maintenance of roads, overpasses, storm-water drainage, sewer and other
services for Jamal Abdul Nasser Street, Kuwait City, Kuwait (the “Project”).”? The
Project involves the construction of an elevated six-lane expressway spanning nearly
7.2 km in total length, along with associated infrastructure, to replace the existing

Jamal Abdul Nasser Street. Extending west of the city centre, the highway will

connect downtown Kuwait City to numerous hospitals, ministries and housing

developments, along with Kuwait University and the city’s major port.®

On 28 August 2010, a joint venture constituted of the Claimants and a Kuwaiti
company, Boodai Constructions w.1.1 (“Boodai’”) (collectively, the “JV") submitted a
tender for the Project to an organ of the Respondent, the Ministry of Public Works
(‘MPW’).° The JV’s bid was accepted, and on 3 February 2011, the JV concluded a
contract with the MPW"° entitled “Construction, Completion and Maintenance of
Roads, Overpasses, Storm-Water Drainage, Sewer and other Services for Jamal
Abdul Nasser Street” (“Contract’).'' The Contract provided that the total price of the

works was expected to be KWD 242,420,240.954 (approximately USD 800 million).'?

Initially divided into two milestones and five phases, the Project was slated to begin
on 1 May 2011 and be completed on 28 October 2016.'? However, throughout the
life of the Project, the Respondent has allegedly obstructed smooth progress of the
works, thereby causing the Claimants significant cost and delay while exhibiting

“unexpected and unjustified hostility toward the JV”.

In support of their assertions above, the Claimants list a series of actions purportedly
taken by the Respondent to delay and disrupt the regular progress of the works.

According to the Claimants, the Respondent has:

failed to ensure the issuance of the necessary construction permitting by the
1 May 2011 commencement date. On 26 July 2011, nearly three months after

the scheduled commencement date, the JV received only partial permitting;'®

failed to make key appointments to the detriment of the Project. The Contract
foresaw the participation of both an official of the MPW (the “Engineer”) and
a consultant (the “Engineer’s Representative”). However, the MPW:
(i) failed to appoint the Engineer Representative until 7 July 2011, despite the
JV’s multiple calls to do so since 5 May 2011;'° (ii) failed to appoint the
Engineer until 17 July 2011;"7 (iii) failed to hold the foreseen pre-construction
meeting until 20 September 2011;'® and (iv) failed to provide the JV with
fundamental points, lines and levels of reference until 26 September 2011

despite the JV’s appeals since 13 April 2011;'9

failed to provide the JV with timely access to critical areas of the Project site
to the detriment of the Project. For instance, the MPW failed to provide the JV
access to the grounds of Kuwait University, which are directly in the path of
the Project, despite the JV’s multiple requests to do so since 26 April 2011.?°
Permission was finally granted on 7 July 2012 for the JV to access a limited
area of the Kuwait University to conduct pile testing but the JV was
subsequently refused access to the university and its equipment on 11 July
2012. The JV was forced to leave its equipment idle inside the university from
11 July 2012 to 4 August 2012 when it was permitted to remove it.21 On

10 January 2013, the Engineer's Representative finally provided confirmation

of permission to take possession of the site to commence works, more than
18 months after possession was required.?? According to the Claimants,
similar scenarios unfolded with regard to possession of other key sites,
including the premises of the Water Distillation Plant, the Kuwait Port

Authority North and the Kuwait Port Authority South;

failed to respect the foreseen sequence of works at significant cost to the
Claimants. For instance, as the Project required the demolition of the Ghazali
Bridge, the JV provided a proposed detour scheme on 20 October 2012 in
order to temporarily divert the bridge’s traffic away from the area of works.
However, the Engineer's Representative rejected the proposed detour
scheme. The JV resubmitted a detour scheme on 27 October 2013 and in
December 2014. However, on 14 April 2015, rather than finally approving the
detour scheme, the MPW instructed the JV to continue construction of a
separate portion of the Jamal Abdul Nasser Street highway instead. This
required the JV to re-sequence its works on the Project, and allegedly forced

the JV to delay its works along the mainline of the Project;24

provided the JV with a Project design ("Design”) containing substantial
inconsistencies and errors. The Engineer's Representative was notified of
these inconsistencies and errors by way of requests for information (“RFIs”)
from the JV. However, the MPW’s responses to the RFls were substantially
delayed (for instance, there was one response which came 225 days later),
provided vague and inconclusive answers and/or instructed the JV to perform

the calculations and modify the design themselves. As the errors in the

Design required the JV to modify the related drawings and perform additional
engineering work, the JV claimed that this amounted to a variation and
submitted a claim for an extension of time and financial compensation to the

Engineer on 7 April 2015;° and

failed to provide adequately designed and planned detours. As the Project
works were to be built on an existing carriageway and on land adjacent to the
carriageway, it was necessary for road detours to be constructed and existing
services that interfered with the construction works to be diverted before any
permanent work could commence. However, the JV discovered conflicts
between the drawing in the Design for the proposed new utilities in Phase 1
and the MPW’s traffic management requirements, as well as defects in the
MPW’s design specifications for traffic detours throughout the whole Project
site. Consequently, the JV “had to endure a particularly protracted submittals
process”, install new utilities in advance of constructing detours and/or add
extra protection to existing utilities during the construction of overpasses,

ramps and service roads.?”

The Claimants further assert that the Respondent's “unreasonable and arbitrary
behavior and the resulting design inadequacies and various delays and disruptions”

as set out above led to significant increases in both the costs associated with the

Project and the time needed for its completion.22 Consequently, the JV submitted

two consolidated interim claims, namely Interim Clam No. 1 (“IC1")?° and Interim

Claim No. 2 (“IC2”)*°, which set out entitlements for defined periods of time.

However, according to the Claimants, these claims were handled by the Respondent

with significant delay and procedural irregularities.

IC1, which covered the period from 1 May 2011 to 25 September 2013, was
submitted to the MPW on 3 June 2014. In IC1, the JV claimed: (i) an extension of
time to perform the Contract by 664 days for Milestone 1 and 506 days for Milestone
2; and (ii) an additional payment of KWD 19,746,881.12 (approximately
USD 64,700,000).*' The Claimants assert that, despite the JV's attempts to follow up
on the status of IC1 “at every opportunity, including at all monthly progress

meetings”, the MPW remained silent.°?

On 22 May 2016, the JV submitted IC2, which covered the period from 25 September
2013 to 25 April 2015, to the MPW. As an update to the claims put forward in IC1, the
JV revised its total claims to: (i) an extension of time to perform the Contract by
1060 days notwithstanding its proposals to mitigate those delays; and (ii) the
additional payment of a total of KWD 76,654,223.12 (approximately

USD 251,450,000).*°

On 9 August 2016, the MPW issued a one-page letter* rejecting the JV’s claims for
additional compensation in their entirety, without any reasoning or justification. The
MPW further decided to grant only an extension of time of 151 days, which was
conditional upon the JV’s waiver of all “entitlements against the aforementioned
claim, and [any] right in any judicial or amicable claim or any extension of time for the

Contract”.*

On 23 September 2016, the MPW issued its determination on IC2.°° In the said

determination, the MPW rejected all claims for additional compensation and

extension of time in their entirety, save for an entitlement to an extension of time (the

duration of which was not confirmed) for the Ghazali Road works but without any

associated compensation for the costs.°”

In addition to the above, the Claimants assert that the Respondent has exhibited

unexpected and unjustified hostility toward the JV, which they say includes:

(a)

(b)

the continual harassment and the issuance of threats and orders to terminate
the contracts of staff. For instance, the MPW required the JV to terminate, at

short notice and without justification, the contracts of senior staff members;**

the application of numerous financial penalties in an arbitrary manner. For
instance, the MPW notified the JV on 12 February 2014 of its intent to
withhold KWD 629,000 (approximately USD 2,060,000) from the JV for an
alleged failure to submit a recovery programme, even though the JV was not
required to do so given that the delay was caused by MPW. The said penalty
was increased to KWD 931,600 (approximately USD 3,050,000) by 25 May

2014; and

threatening to issue a retroactive negative variation order for the span-by-
span method (“SBS Method”). The Design foresaw a balanced cantilever
method for the erection of the elevated highway. On 21 August 2011, the JV

proposed that the MPW consider an alternative erection method known as the

MPW’'s Determination on IC2 of 23 September 2016, Exhibit C-72.

SBS Method, which the JV explained could result in possible cost saving for
the Respondent of KWD 1,600,000 (approximately USD 5,250,000). The SBS
Method was only approved on 23 February 2012, and under the conditions
that, inter alia, any costs of redesign be borne by the JV, that the entire
duration of the Project be reduced by four months and that the JV waive
present claims in terms of time or money as a result of the SBS Method. On
15 March 2012, the JV agreed to those conditions, and stated on record that
the alternative method of erection did not represent a variation order and that
the accounting of all elements affected by the SBS Method were to be carried
out in accordance with the current terms and conditions of the Contract. On
15 December 2014, the MPW made clear its intention to apply a negative
variation order against the alleged costs savings made by the JV on the basis
that the amount of steel reinforcement used for the SBS Method was less
than that foreseen in the Contract, which the JV vigorously contested. On
3 January 2016, the MPW informed the JV of its decision to apply a negative
variation order in the amount of KWD 14,076,577 (approximately
USD 46,150,000), which the Claimants allege is in direct contrast with the

parties’ agreement concerning the SBS Method.*°

In their Request for Arbitration, the Claimants argue that the Respondent's actions as
set out above amount to breaches of the Contract, and that these breaches
effectively equate to breaches of the BITs pursuant to the “umbrella clause” (i.e.
Article 3.2) under the Spain-Kuwait BIT and/or the “Most Favoured Nation” clause
(ie. Article 3) in the Italy-Kuwait BIT.“' The Claimants further argue that the

Respondent’s actions, taken together, amount to a breach of the applicable

Claimants’ Request for Arbitration dated 7 February 2017 at [111] to [124].

prohibitions against the illegal expropriation of the Claimants’ investment. 4? In

addition, the Claimants assert that the conduct of the Respondent amounts to

violations of other guarantees and standards of treatment that must be accorded to

foreign investors, including: (i) the fair and equitable treatment standard;** (ii) the rule

against unreasonable measures; and (iii) the full protection and security standard.*®

The reliefs sought by the Claimants in their Request for Arbitration are:4°

(a)

(b)

an order, on an interim basis, that the Respondent be refrained from calling

any bonds in its possession, pending the outcome of the proceedings;

an order, on an interim basis, that the Project works be brought immediately

to a halt, pending the outcome of the present proceedings;

an order, on an interim basis, that the Respondent be refrained from
implementing a retroactive negative variation order in relation to the SBS

Method;

In the next section of this Decision, the Tribunal will review the Parties’ positions and
arguments in respect of the Claimants’ Application and the Respondent's Application.
Naturally, it is not meant to serve as an exhaustive review of the Parties’ submissions
on the two Applications at issue, but as a summary of the arguments that are
relevant to the Tribunal’s analysis and findings. Regardless, the Tribunal has
carefully considered all of the submissions made by the Parties, whether in writing or

made orally during the Hearing.

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

A. The Claimants’ Application

In the Claimants’ Application, the Claimants seek the following six provisional

measures:*”

“a. That all ongoing works for the Project shall be immediately brought to
a halt pending the final outcome of the arbitration proceedings;

52.

b. That the [Respondent], during the pendency of this arbitration, shall
refrain from calling any bonds issued by the Claimants through the
[Claimants’ Bank, the Kuwait Branch of BNP PARIBAS (the “Bank”)]
made in favour of the [Respondent], for and in relation to the Project;

Cc. That the [Respondent], during the pendency of this arbitration, shall
refrain from applying further delay penalties, including those which it
has, to date, postponed;

d. That the [Respondent], during the pendency of this arbitration, shall
refrain from implementing a retroactive negative variation order in
relation to the SBS Method;

e. That the [Respondent] and/or their agencies or entities refrain from
engaging in any other conduct that aggravates the dispute between
the parties and/or alters the status quo; and

f. That the [Respondent] be ordered...to pay all costs and expenses
relating to the provisional measures phase, including, but not limited
to, administrative and legal fees, with interest as of the date of the
[Decision on Provisional Measures] until the date of effective
payment.”

In its Request for Provisional Measures, the Claimants state that they urgently
require the provisional measures “in order to preserve their right to maintain the

status quo of the dispute pending final adjudication by the Tribunal”.*®

The Claimants argue that given the Respondent's “past established pattern or
arbitrary and unpredictable behavior and threats” (as set out above), there is an
“immense and imminent risk” that the Respondent will “unilaterally, and with no
justification, (i) implement a retroactive negative variation order for the adoption of
the SBS Method in the Project, (ii) apply further delay penalties which have recorded

in payment certificates but deferred, and (iii) call the bonds in its possession”.*°

According to the Claimants, the Respondent’s treatment of the Claimants “has

worsened substantially” since the Claimants sent the Notice of Investment Dispute to

Claimants’ Request for Provisional Measures dated 12 April 2017 at [1].

the Respondent on 7 September 2017. °° By way of example, the Claimants say that
the MPW informed the Central Tenders Committee on 4 April 2017 of its
unwillingness to “cooperate with [the Claimants]” and to “enter into any contract with
[the Claimants] or to qualify them for any future project” because the Claimants have
allegedly breached the Contract and resorted to international arbitration. In response,
the Central Tenders Committee decided that it would choose whether to approve the

termination of the Contract once it had received further information from the MPW.*"

The Claimants argue that they have established the required circumstances for the

Tribunal to grant the requested provisional measures.

In this regard, the Claimants disagree that the Respondent's “six-pronged test”® is
the applicable test, and submit that the Tribunal’s power to grant provisional
measures stems exclusively from Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, the ICSID
Arbitration Rules and the framework for treaty interpretation. The Claimants state that
“a plain reading of the language of Article 47 provides broad and open-ended powers
to the Tribunal to make orders destined to maintain the Parties’ rights, especially
through the maintenance of the status quo and prevention of the aggravation of the
dispute, as is required in the present circumstances”. ®* However, the Claimants
accept that while ICSID tribunals enjoy wide discretion in granting provisional

measures, a showing of necessity and urgency is generally required.>*

Claimants’ Reply on Provisional Measures dated 24 May 2017 at [46] to [47].

At [58] of the Respondent's Response to the Claimants’ Request for Provisional Measures dated
10 May 2017, the Respondent states that “[a]s the foregoing authorities indicate, a party seeking
provisional measures bears the burden of establishing that, at the time of filing the request, there is an
urgent need [1] for the requested measures to avoid irreparable harm [2] to a right belonging to the
party. It is also well-established that the requesting party must show: a prima facie basis for jurisdiction
[3]; a prima facie case and a reasonable chance of success on the merits [4]; that the requested
measures do not require prejudging the merits [5]; and that the measures do not unduly harm the other
party [6]".

57.

Applying the above test to this case, the Claimants argue that the requested
provisional measures are required to preserve the status quo and to prevent the

aggravation of the dispute.

First, the Claimants assert that they are unable to sustain progress on the Project
any longer in the face of the Respondent’s continuing and worsening hostility and
arbitrariness. Further, the Claimants expect to contribute at least KWD 4,500,000
(approximately USD 14,750,000) to the JV to finance works during the period
January to June 2017, which the Claimants anticipate the Respondent will “refuse to
pay”. This sum will likely increase due to the Respondent’s “unjustifiable refusal to
pay the JV all sums due”. Consequently, the only “fair and viable option is to alleviate
the cash flow burden currently forced upon the Claimants by suspending the works

until such time as these arbitration proceedings are concluded”.®>

Secondly, the Claimants submit that the status quo is the solvency of the Claimants
and their existence as functioning business, and not the continuation of the Project.
In this regard, the “threat of death” from the forced continuation of the Project is
coupled with threats of: (i) abusive calling of the bonds; (ii) imposition of the negative
variation order in respect of the SBS method; and (iii) application of the myriad delay

penalties:°°

(a) In relation to (i), the Claimants say that the Respondent's actions indicate that
“it very likely intends to call the bonds”, which the Bank has issued in the

Respondent's favour, once the Respondent has “extracted maximum value

from the Investment”.9” At present, the Respondent holds bonds issued by
the Bank in the total sum of KWD 45,478,760 (approximately
USD 148,800,000).°° The Bonds are unconditional and on-demand. As such,
the Respondent is entitled to payment in full in respect of each bond simply
by submitting a request to the Bank, even if none of the defaults against
which the bonds protect the Respondent have occurred. © Given the
Respondent's repeated, continuous and unjustified hostility toward the
Claimants to date and its unexpected, arbitrary actions, the Claimants are
“legitimately and seriously concerned” that the Respondent will disregard the
purpose of the bonds and call on them “in retaliation for the institution of these

proceedings or once the works are nearing completion”.

With regard to (ii), the Claimants allege that the Respondent has, in
continuance of its prior pattern of conduct whereby it arbitrarily applied
penalties to the JV, wrongfully and without justification applied and then
deferred substantial delay penalties. In particular, the latest Interim Payment
Certificate covering the period of the works up to 28 February 2017 applied,
but then deferred unjustified delay penalties of KWD 10,807,617
(approximately USD 35,360,000).* As of 3 November 2017, the outstanding

delay penalties amount to approximately USD 80 million.

As for (iii), the Claimants assert that the Respondent continues to threaten an

arbitrary issuance of a retroactive negative variation order for use of the SBS

Method in the amount of KWD_  9,871,067.151 (approximately
USD 32,330,000).* While the Respondent claims that the negative variation
order would be issued to cover alleged cost savings arising for a reduced
requirement for steel reinforcement when employing the SBS Method, the
Respondent has failed to acknowledge that additional quantities of other
materials were required, including concrete. In any event, the price per
segment of the highway was fixed in the Contract, and the Respondent does
not have the right to unilaterally impose a change to the price which was

contractually agreed and fixed.

According to the Claimants, the failure to grant provisional measures will cause the

Claimants irreparable harm.® The continuation of the Project involves the continuous

input of additional liquidity and the exponential growth of the financial burden on the

Claimants. The Claimants have already been severely affected by the Respondent's

summary denial of their entitlement to USD 251,450,000 as set out in IC2, the JV

suffers ongoing losses amounting to approximately USD 110,000 per day, and the

calling of bonds and the imposition of a negative variation order would immediately

result in further liabilities of approximately USD 148,800,0000 and USD 32,400,000

respectively. In this regard, the Claimants argue that:

(a)

the consequences of suffering the above financial setbacks are obvious,

given that OHL is a listed company;

as for Rizzani, if such liabilities were to arise, it would make the company

insolvent, prevent the company from paying salaries to thousands of

employees and put the continued existence of the company in jeopardy.
There would also be a powerful and disastrous domino effect. For instance,
Rizzani’s other financial counterparties®’ would very likely seek to revoke all
other financial facilities granted to Rizzani and demand the immediate

repayment of financed amounts; and

a similar domino effect would likely be felt by all the Claimants in terms of
their reputations more generally, especially since construction companies
such as the Claimants are required, by tender conditions or law, to expressly
declare whether other employers have called bonds on their projects or

applied other penalties to them.

Thirdly, the Claimants accept that the Tribunal will have to “perform a proportionality

assessment, and consider any limitation provisional measures would cause to [the]

Respondent's rights”. However, the Claimants argue that any such limitation is

minimal and pales in comparison with the Claimants’ need for protection. The

Claimants say that:

(a)

the Respondent grossly exaggerates the alleged harm it would endure if the
Project were halted. The Jamal Abdul Nasser Street is mostly complete and
open to the public, and with the associated preapproved detours, adequately

links all key locations and infrastructure that it was designed to serve;

Rizzani has in place a financing agreement with Unicredit S.p.A for the value of EUR 50,000,000, the

banking facilities contract between BNP Paribas Kuwait Branch and Rizzani provides Rizzani with
uncommitted banking facilities of up to approximately KWD 11,000,000 for the purpose of the Project
and Banza Nazionale de Lavoro S.p.A has issued guarantees for up to EUR 242,508.293 for the benefit
of Rizzani and another Italian construction company in relation to another construction project in Algeria.

(b)

the detours in place have been explicitly approved by the Respondent, and
were built to demanding specifications to prevent congestion. Overall, the
current area of open road, including completed parts of the Project and
detours, have increased from 357,000 square metres to 618,000 square

metres since the Project began;”°

the arrangements regarding drainage and utilities are also approved by the
Respondent and would not, contrary to the Respondent’s claim, lead to
“massive flooding”. In addition, the traffic plan which the Claimants agreed
with MPW mandates myriad safety measures for detours on the Project, so

as to render them safer than the majority of Kuwaiti roads;7"

any delay to the Project would not cause delay to neighbouring projects as
such projects are “independent” from the Project. The Contract makes no
mention of neighbouring projects, and the Respondent had not raised with the
JV concerns that delays to the Project would prevent neighbouring projects

from completing;”

in the event that the provisional measures were granted, the Claimants would
also not demobilise all staff but would continue to provide supervised teams
responsible for security, health and safety and for maintaining the detours,

utilities and stormwater management system;7° and

(f) the Respondent will not face any issues of liquidity if it was enjoined from
calling the bonds, applying delay penalties or implementing the negative

variation order.”

60. In addition, the Claimants submit that even if the Tribunal applies the Respondent’s
“six-pronged test’, the Claimants’ request for provisional measures should still be

granted.

61. First, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal has prima facie jurisdiction because:

(a) prima facie jurisdiction is satisfied when a duly ratified instrument of consent
exists and a breach of rights is alleged. In the present case, the Claimants’
Request for Arbitration has been duly registered by the ICSID Secretariat
pursuant to the two BITs and the ICSID Convention, and the alleged

breaches of the BITs are, to say the least, plausible;”°

(b) the Respondent's objection that the Tribunal does not have prima facie
jurisdiction because the cooling-off period was not respected is “absurd”. Not
only would it have been futile in the circumstances to continue attempting
negotiations in the face of the Respondent's “continuous and deafening
silence”, the alleged “defect” boils down to a mere 28 days which have

passed many times over by now;7

63.

(c) the Respondent’s argument that there is a lack of a protected investment is
“equally absurd”. Investor-State arbitration is no stranger to cases involving

the construction sector, with at least 69 such cases publicly known;”” and

(d) the Respondent's argument that “mere contract breaches by a State do not
become treaty claims even in the presence of an umbrella clause” has been
widely criticised. Further, the presence of choice of forum clauses has not
prevented tribunals from hearing claims brought under umbrella clauses, and
there is nothing contentious about the importation of substantive protections
through an MEN clause. In any case, while the Respondent may find the
above “controversial”, this is not sufficient to deprive the Tribunal of prima

facie jurisdiction.”

Secondly, the Claimants argue that they are in agreement with the Respondent that a
prima facie case on the merits is established when allegations are not frivolous.
According to the Claimants, the Respondent's submissions do not attempt to
demonstrate the alleged frivolity of the Claimants’ claims on the merits, but simply
restate the Respondent's jurisdictional objection that the case is a “contract dispute
that should have been brought before the domestic courts of Kuwait”. Such
jurisdictional objections are not relevant to the existence of a prima facie case on the

merits.”

Thirdly, the Claimants submit that the granting of the requested provisional measures
would not amount to a prejudgment on the merits. The Claimants say that it is

unclear how the granting of the provisional measures with regard to the bonds,

negative variation order and delay penalties could “cast a shadow” on the
Respondent's ability to present its case, and the discontinuation of the Project until
the conclusion of the proceedings would also not presume any outcome. The
Claimants are also not seeking provisional measures “equivalent to the final result

sought”.®°

Fourthly, the Claimants submit that provisional measures are inherently urgent once
they are destined to preserve the status quo and non-aggravation of the dispute. In
any case, the urgency of the Claimants’ situation is self-evident. The JV
“hemorrhages losses” on the Project with every passing day and the Respondent is
free to call, at any moment and with immediate effect, more than a hundred million

dollars’ worth of bonds, negative variation order and myriad delay penalties.*"

Fifthly, the Claimants argue that the requested measures are needed to avoid
irreparable harm. In this regard, the Claimants state that irreparable harm in the
ICSID context must be understood as “synonymous with serious, substantial or
significant harm”. The Respondent's definition of “irreparable harm” as harm that
cannot ultimately be compensated by monetary damages would all but exclude
provisional measures within the ICSID framework, thereby depriving Article 47 of its

effet utile.®?

Sixthly, the Claimants assert that the requested measures would not cause the
Respondent “disproportionate harm” as the harm which the Respondent alleges it
would suffer if the requested provisional measures are ordered is either grossly

exaggerated or non-existent. The Respondent's alleged harm also pales in

comparison with the harm the Claimants would suffer without the granting of

provisional measures.®?

B. The Respondent’s Position on the Claimants’ Application

The Respondent submits that there is no merit to the Claimants’ argument that
Article 47 of the ICSID Convention offers the kind of broad, open-ended availability of
provisional measures that Claimants allege. Instead, the “overwhelming weight of
authorities” confirm that provisional measures may only be granted if the Claimants

prove:®

(a) an urgent risk of imminent, irreparable harm;

(b) a prima facie showing of jurisdiction;

(c) a prima facie case on the merits;

(d) that the urgent, irreparable harm to the Claimants “greatly” outweighs the
harm that would be caused to the Respondent if the interim measures were

granted; and

(e) that the request does not require the Tribunal to prejudge the merits of the

claims.

70.

According to the Respondent, the Claimants have failed to meet these stringent

standards.

First, the Respondent argues that that there is no urgency or threat of imminent,
irreparable harm. According to the Respondent, the ICSID tribunals have uniformly
agreed that provisional measures should be granted only when they “are necessary
to preserve a party’s rights and where the need is urgent in order to avoid irreparable
harm”. The burden of showing these elements falls squarely on the requesting party
and where supporting evidence is lacking, provisional measures must be denied.®*
The Respondent further argues that it is widely recognised that the requirement of
“irreparable harm” is not present when the alleged harm can be adequately remedied

by monetary damages.®”

In response to the Claimants’ argument that provisional measures are “inherently
urgent” if they are intended to preserve the status quo and non-aggravation of the
dispute, the Respondent claims that in the first place, it is the Claimants who are
seeking to change the status quo by stopping work on an ongoing Project and
precluding MPW from exercising its own remedies under a Contract currently in
force. In contrast, there has been no threat by the Respondent to terminate the
Claimants’ Contract. ® There has also been no aggravation of the dispute or
“worsening conditions” that would justify the Claimants’ request to stop work on the

Project, nor any of the other provisional measures they seek.®° In fact, as the

Claimants themselves recognize, it is in the interest of MPW to facilitate progress of

the Project so that it can be completed.*

The Respondent further argues that if the core premise of the Claimants’ request for
provisional measures is the alleged financial burden that the Claimants would face in
continuing performance of the Project, it is not clear what the reason for the
Claimants’ purported “financial stress” is. According to the Respondent, MPW has
upheld its side of the bargain: (i) it gave the Claimants a 10% advance payment in
the amount of KWD 24,242,024; (ii) it released to the Claimants, without legal
obligation, retention monies in the amount of an additional KWD 13,296,524 to assist
in their cash flow; and (iii) it has punctually paid the monthly invoices presented by
the Claimants.% Further, the Claimants’ allegation of the threat of “financial ruination”
is only made in respect of one of the three Claimants, Rizzani and there is no
evidence to support the allegation of Rizzani’s financial difficulties.°* In any case, the
potential issuance of the negative variation order, the deferred delay penalties, or a
supposed risk of calling on bonds are hypothetical future possibilities which cannot

serve as proof of imminent, irreparable harm.°*

In respect of each of the Claimants’ requested provisional measures, the Respondent

takes the following positions:

(a) The request to stop work on the Project: the Respondent claims that there is
an “improper motivation” behind this request - the Claimants’ strategy is to

hold the Project hostage until the Respondent gives in to the Claimants’

30

demands on the pending contractual disputes between the parties. In
addition, the Claimants have not shown that halting the Project is urgently
needed to avoid imminent, irreparable harm. If the “intolerable financial
burden” stems from the Claimants’ purported claims to additional
compensation which they sought in IC1 and IC2, or the allegation that
Claimants are incurring losses of USD 110,000 per day on the Project, the
Claimants have not presented any evidence at all to substantiate their claims
that these have led to their financial inability to sustain work on the Project. In
any event, even if the Claimants were to prevail on all of their claims during
the course of this arbitration, they can obtain monetary damages in

compensation at that point in time.°°

The request to enjoin the Respondent from _calling_on the bonds: the
Respondent argues that the Claimants’ expressed fear that the Respondent is
“highly likely” to call one or all of the bonds “is nothing more than a made-up
storyline with no evidence to support it’. The JV is required under the
Contract and Kuwaiti law to post and maintain a variety of bonds to guarantee
a myriad of obligations. Unless the Claimants are planning on breaching
these obligations, there is no reason why any or all of these bonds would be
called, immediately or in the near future. There has also been no threat to call
on the bonds. Quite apart from the lack of evidence that any call of any of the
bonds is likely or highly likely to cause the financial ruination of Rizzani, there
is no reason to believe that the four JV partners could not and would not

collectively sustain the financial burden that would entail.°°

(a)

The request to enjoin the Respondent from applying delay penalties: the
Respondent states that it is undisputed that MPW is not deducting delay
penalties from progress payments or otherwise collecting delay penalties from
Claimants. MPW is merely recording the delay penalties incurred by
Claimants. The Respondent also explains that the amounts of these delay
penalties will not be finalised until the end of the Project, and that the mere
recording of penalties, years away from actual collection, represents no harm,

let alone imminent, irreparable harm, to the Claimants.°”

The request to enjoin the Respondent from implementing the negative
variation order: the Respondent submits that the discussions regarding the
negative variation order have been ongoing for two and a half years and there
is no evidence that MPW has taken actual measures to impose the negative
variation order at the present time. Even if a final decision on the negative
variation order was taken and applied, there is no evidence that the amount of
the variation order (i.e. USD 32 million) would jeopardise the financial stability
of the Claimants, especially given that it reflects the price of steel
reinforcement for which they have been paid, but which they have not had to
purchase for use in the works. There is also no evidence of the means by
which the final decision on a negative variation order would be effected, and it
should not be presumed that the Claimants would effectively be presented

with a bill for USD 32 million requiring an immediate lump-sum payment.°®

The request to enjoin the Respondent from “aggravating” the dispute _and

altering the status quo: the Respondent argues that the Claimants’ request

violates well-established principles regarding provisional measures. Such a
broad request does not enable the Tribunal to identify the risk from which the
Claimants need to be protected, the nature of such risk and the urgency and

necessity of the provisional measures.

(f) The request to order the Respondent to pay all costs of the provisional
measures phase, including maintenance during project suspension: the
Claimants have, in their Reply,‘ requested for the first time for costs of
continued maintenance. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal should not
allow the Claimants to be compensated for costs arising from a situation that
they themselves will have created to the detriment of the Party from which
they seek costs. It would also appear that the Claimants’ promise to maintain
the deteriorating detour roads and unfinished utilities until the final outcome of
the arbitration proceedings is contingent on the Tribunal granting a cost

award in favour of the Claimants. 1°"

Secondly, the Respondent submits that the requested measures would cause greater
harm to the Respondent and/or third parties than the harm allegedly faced by the
Claimants. '°? Granting the interim measures requested by the Claimants, particularly
the request to stop all works on the Project, would according to the Respondent
irreparably: (i) prevent adjacent projects from completion and opening to traffic;
(ii) cause acute, potentially fatal, safety risks for drivers and pedestrians alike; and

(iii) lead to an indefinite period of traffic congestion and non-access to numerous

commercial and public establishments, several hospitals among them. Harm caused
to third parties, such as contractors, pedestrians, drivers, commercial and other
establishments, as a result of the disrupted road works, could also expose the
Respondent to further litigation and criminal liability. The alleged harm to the
Respondent and/or third parties is discussed in more detail in the Witness
Statements of Mr John Andrew Faulkner, the Respondent's witness. The Tribunal will
not detail Mr Faulkner’s evidence here, but will refer to it in its decision below, where

relevant.

Thirdly, the Respondent argues that that the provisional measures requested would
require the Tribunal to prejudge the merits of the case. According to the Respondent,
the underlying basis of the Claimants’ Application is the financial burden they
allegedly face in continuing the Project without a favourable resolution of their
contract claims. Claimants argue that this financial burden is due to: (i) the denial of
their requests for additional compensation in IC1 and IC2; (ii) MPW’s proposed
negative variation order in respect of the SBS Method; and (iii) the recording and
possible future application of contractual delay penalties. Granting the provisional
measures requested by the Claimants would therefore require the Tribunal to decide
on those questions, finding that the Claimants are entitled to the additional time and
money that they alleged in IC1 and IC2 for works performed in prior years; that they
are not obliged to account for overpayments they received for anticipated steel
expenditures and that they bear no blame for delays in completing the works by the
established contractual deadline. Only on such a basis would halting a major and
ongoing infrastructure project and depriving MPW of its contractual rights could

possibly be justified. 1°

Fourthly, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have not established a prima

facie case on jurisdiction because:'*

(a)

(c)

the fact that the Claimants’ Request for Arbitration has been duly registered
by the ICSID Secretariat is not sufficient for the Tribunal to hold that it has
prima facie jurisdiction over the dispute. The Tribunal must itself be satisfied

that there is prima facie basis for jurisdiction;

the Claimants failed to observe the six-month cooling-off period required by
both the Italy-Kuwait and the Spain-Kuwait BITs. The Claimants also do not
explain why it would have been futile to comply with the six-month cooling-off

period;

the Claimants do not contest that in the Contract governing the Project, they
agreed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the domestic courts of Kuwait for any
disputes arising between the parties relating thereto. The contractually-
agreed exclusive jurisdiction of the domestic courts in Kuwait would prevent
the Tribunal from exercising jurisdiction, even if there were an umbrella
clause, as in the case of the Spain-Kuwait BIT. If the Claimants elevate their
contractual claims to be cognizable under the BITs via an umbrella clause,
they cannot cherry-pick and all provisions of the Contract, including the forum

selection clause, must be given full effect; and

the Claimants do not have an “investment” for the purposes of the ICSID
Convention and the BITs. The Claimants’ activities in Kuwait have been

conducted under a one-time construction contract to perform road upgrading

106

works, for which they were paid a 10% advance payment and periodic
progress payments. The Project did not require the Claimants to invest their

own funds, but was intended to have a “positive cash flow”.

Fifthly, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants have not established prima facie
valid treaty claims with a likelihood of success.'% In this regard, the Respondent
argues that the key element is not the prima facie existence of a dispute, but whether
or not there are prima facie valid treaty claims having a likelihood of success. There
are serious doubts whether the Claimants have a valid treaty claim, or merely a
contract claim which must be resolved through the courts of Kuwait. In any case, on
the evidence submitted, none of the Claimants may be said to have established a
prima facie case on the merits of a likelihood of success of their contract claims,
whether they constitute treaty claims or not. Under the Contract, it is for the MPW to
determine the amount of extension of time for the completion of the Works, and the
amount (if any) to be added or deducted from the sum named in the tender.
Consequently, the Claimants’ claims in IC1 and IC2 have already been resolved and

must be considered prima facie invalid.

Cc. The Respondent’s Application

In the Respondent's Application, the Respondent seeks the following seven

provisional measures: 1°

its governmental subdivisions relating to the dispute that is the subject
matter of this arbitration that have been commenced in the courts of

Milan, Italy, as well as any such other proceedings that have been
commenced before any other national court or authority in any
country, whether judicial, administrative or otherwise, during the
pendency of this arbitration, in violation of the ICSID Convention
and/or the exclusive jurisdiction clause of the Contract;

Vacate the ex parte judgments obtained in the court in Milan, Italy;

Inform the Tribunal and Respondent as to whether any other
proceedings relating to the dispute that is the subject matter of this
arbitration have been commenced before any national court of
authority, whether judicial, administrative or otherwise, during the
pendency of this arbitration;

Refrain from commencing any other proceedings relating to the
dispute that is the subject matter of this arbitration before any other
national court or authority in any country, whether judicial,
administrative or otherwise, during the pendency of this arbitration, in
violation of the ICSID Convention and/or the exclusive jurisdiction
clause of the Contract;

Continue to perform works on the Project duly required under the
Contract and in accordance with the present program of works
scheduled for completion by February 2019;

Continue to maintain in place all bonds required for the Project under
the Contract and/or under the laws of Kuwait for the duration of the
Project until Claimants have completed all of their contractual
obligations; and

Refrain from engaging in any other conduct that aggravates the
dispute between the Parties and/or alters the status quo.”

The Respondent asserts that it seeks provisional measures aimed at ensuring that

the Claimants carry out their contractual and legal obligations and do not violate the

rules of ICSID arbitration during the course of this case, “[nJothing more, nothing

less”.'°”

First, the Respondent states in its Reply on Provisional Measures dated 2 October

2017'° that it maintains its jurisdictional objections in this case, and that its request

for provisional measures is made without prejudice to and without waiving those

objections. The Respondent also argues that it is fully entitled to maintain and

preserve its jurisdictional objections even while seeking provisional measures. '?

Secondly, the Respondent submits that the Claimants must be enjoined from taking
recourse to domestic court actions in respect of the subject matter of this dispute,
whether in Milan, Italy or elsewhere, as well as the other provisional measures it has
requested, including full disclosure of their actions and withdrawal of the Milan
actions. In this regard, the Respondent points to two ex parte actions filed by the
Claimants Rizzani and Trevi in the domestic courts in Milan, Italy within three days of
initiating this ICSID arbitration, where both Rizzani and Trevi succeeded in obtaining
injunctions preventing MPW, the Municipality of Kuwait and the Ministry of Labor and
Social Affairs from calling on any of the bonds posted in connection with the

Project."°

The Respondent argues that the two Milan court proceedings commenced by the
Claimants violate Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, which provides that once
parties have consented to arbitration pursuant to the Convention, such consent
“shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the

exclusion of any other remedy”.'"!

In addition, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants’ undertaking to withdraw the
Milan proceedings after this Tribunal rules on the Claimants’ Application is
insufficient. That undertaking cannot stand as a substitute for an order of the Tribunal

granting the Respondent's requests for provisional measures (i) through (iv) which go

beyond the Milan actions. An affirmative order is also required to ensure the

Claimants’ compliance.''2

Thirdly, in relation to its request to compel continued performance by the Claimants,
the Respondent argues that it has every reason to be alarmed by the Claimants’
assertions in this case as a serious threat that they are ready to walk away from the
Project.'"° In this regard, the Respondent submits that: (i) the continuation of the
cooperation between parties in the framework of contracts constitutes the status quo
that is to be preserved by interim measures; '* (ii) irreparable harm to the
Respondent, the public welfare and innocent third parties would be caused if the
project works do not continue; (iii) the balance of hardships weighs in favor of
granting the Respondent's request, given that the Claimants’ accusations that they
have been subjected to a “pattern of hostility” bear no relationship to reality;'® and
(iv) the request does not require the Tribunal to prejudge the merits, since it is

uncontested that the Contract is valid and currently in force.''”

In response to the Claimants’ argument that the Respondent's request is simply the
“mirror image” of the Claimants’ request for an order to stop works, the Respondent
asserts that if the Tribunal were to deny the Claimants’ request for an order to stop
work on the Project, that would only mean that the Claimants failed to obtain the
Tribunal’s blessing to walk away. It is not the same as an order compelling the

Claimants to continue performing their contractually required works on the Project.‘

Fourthly, as for the Respondent's request that the Claimants maintain all bonds
under the Project, the Respondent argues that it has every reason to take seriously
the threat that Claimants will walk away from their obligations in respect of the
Project bonds. According to the Respondent, if the Claimants are not ordered to
preserve the validity of the bonds, MPW and other relevant third parties would face
the imminent loss of their contractual and legal rights. Conversely, the Claimants’
contention that maintaining the bonds for the Project would subject Claimants to

irreparable harm is both speculative and unsubstantiated. ''?

Fifthly, the Respondent submits that it requires an order from the Tribunal expressly
requiring the Claimants to refrain from engaging in any further conduct that would
aggravate this dispute because the Claimants’ “abusive and obstructionist conduct to
date should serve as an indication that, without provisional measures, Claimants will
consider themselves at liberty to engage in further improper, bad faith conduct

aggravating the dispute or altering the status quo”.'7°

D. The Claimants’ Position on the Respondent’s Application

The Claimants assert that each of the Respondent’s requests is untenable, as the
harm caused to the Claimants if they were to be granted far outweighs the harm that
the Respondent would suffer should they be denied. According to the Claimants, the
Respondent's requests must be denied to prevent the dispute from being

aggravated.

First, in respect of the suspension of the works on the Project, the Claimants argue

that the Respondent's hostility and arbitrary conduct is causing daily losses to the JV

123

of USD 109,000 per day. As the Claimants cannot absorb losses of this magnitude
indefinitely, the Claimants’ principal request in the Claimants’ Application is for the
suspension of the Project. However, in the Respondent's Application, the
Respondent has merely filed a mirror request, i.e. request (v), that the Claimants be
compelled to continue working so as to complete the works by February 2019. Such
a request, if granted, would “condemn Claimants to irreparable harm whilst resulting
in the avoidance of little harm to Respondent”.'2" In this regard, the Claimants assert
that any suspension would be carried out further to a considered suspension plan,
which would inter alia set out plans to store plant and materials safely and to
preserve the integrity of the works that have been built, as well as provide supervised
teams responsible for security, health and safety and for maintaining the detours,

utilities and the stormwater management system. '22

Additionally, the Claimants argue that if the Tribunal were to grant the Respondent's
request that the Claimants perform works scheduled “for completion by February
2019”, this would amount to a gross prejudgment of the merits. In particular, it would
require the Tribunal to prejudge the Claimants’ claim that the Respondent failed to
respect its obligations undertaken with regard to the Claimants’ investment, in that it
inter alia unjustifiably and arbitrarily refused to grant the contractually foreseen
extensions of time that entitle the Claimants to a completion date later than February

2019.18

Secondly, in respect of the Respondent's request that the Claimants be ordered to

maintain the bonds, the Claimants argue this request is also a mirror image of the

127
128

Claimants’ requests for the suspension and freezing of the bonds.'4 In any case,
whether or not the Tribunal considers that the Respondent should be allowed to call
the bonds during the pendency of this arbitration, the Claimants will have no choice

but to maintain all bonds in effect. 175

The Claimants further assert that the value of the bonds (approximately
USD 150,000,000), whilst significant to the Claimants, is relatively modest for the
Respondent which is a sovereign State. In any event, the Respondent is not currently
in possession of this sum, and would not suffer harm if it were to continue not to
possess the bonds for the pendency of this arbitration. Conversely, if the Claimants
were to be deprived of such sum, which the Claimants currently possess, this would
irreparably harm the Claimants, as the bond call would cause “cascading defaults
through the financing arrangements of [Rizzani] leading to its bankruptcy, negatively
affect the share price of OHL, and permanently harm the reputations of all

Claimants”.'6

Thirdly, the Claimants assert that the Respondent’s requests in relation to domestic
proceedings are “not only utterly futile, but also unjustified in law”.'?” In this regard,
the Claimants argue that a provisional measure will only be granted to enjoin
domestic proceedings if the exclusivity of the arbitration proceedings is in fact
threatened. '?° However, the Milan court has revoked its decisions and the Claimants
have decided not to file any appeal against the revocation. In any event, the

Claimants have undertaken on several occasions to withdraw any ongoing court

proceedings and vacate any decisions regardless of the Tribunal’s decision on the

Claimants’ Application. 1°

The Claimants also assert that they needed urgent injunctive relief at a time when the
Tribunal had not yet been constituted, and there was no prospect of a tribunal being
constituted rapidly. In the absence of a tribunal able to grant interim relief, the

Claimants had no choice but to seek injunctive relief from the Milan court. '%°

Fourthly, the Claimants argue that the fact that the Respondent has put forth its own
request for provisional measures necessarily satisfies the prima facie jurisdiction
requirement for the grant of provisional measures. According to the Claimants, it
would be nonsensical to file a request for provisional measures before the Tribunal
and, at the same time, contend that one of the requirements for the grant of such
request is not met. It would also be illogical for the Respondent to argue that the
Tribunal lacks prima facie jurisdiction in relation to the Claimants’ request for
provisional measures, but that it has prima facie jurisdiction in relation to its own
request for provisional measures. By introducing its own request for provisional
measures, the Respondent has waived its objections to the Tribunal’s prima facie

jurisdiction.'3"

Fifthly, in response to the Respondent’s request that the Claimants pay all the costs
the Respondent has incurred in relation to the provisional measures phase, the
Claimants argue that this request must be dismissed outright. It has always been the
Claimants’ position that the Respondent's requests (i) to (iv) are utterly pointless as

the Claimants would have withdrawn any ongoing proceedings before the Italian

courts upon receiving the Tribunal’s decision on its request to freeze the bonds,

irrespective of the outcome of the decision. '°?

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

A.

The Tribunal has the power to decide on provisional measures

The Tribunal’s power to recommend provisional measures is governed by Article 47

of the ICSID Convention, which provides:

“Article 47

Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that
the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which
should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.”

In addition, ICSID Arbitration Rule 39 provides that:

“Rule 39
Provisional Measures

(1) At any time after the institution of the proceedings, a party may
request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights to be
recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be
preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the
circumstances that require such measures.

(2) | The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made
pursuant to paragraph (1).

(3) | The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own
initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It
may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.

(4) | The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or
revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of
presenting its observations.

99.

133
134

135

(5) If a party makes a request pursuant to paragraph (1) before the
constitution of the Tribunal, the Secretary-General shall, on the application of
either party, fix time limits for the parties to present observations on the
request, so that the request and observations may be considered by the
Tribunal promptly upon its constitution.

(6) Nothing in this Rule shall prevent the parties, provided that they have
so stipulated in the agreement recording their consent, from requesting any
judicial or other authority to order provisional measures, prior to or after the
institution of the proceeding, for the preservation of their respective rights
and interests.”

Neither the Claimants nor the Respondent has challenged the Tribunal’s power to
grant provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. As set out
above, both Parties have filed their respective requests for provisional measures.
Both Parties also participated at the Hearing and sought orders for provisional
measures from this Tribunal. In addition, both the Claimants’ and the Respondent's
Counsel accepted, at the Hearing on 3 November 2017, that the Tribunal has the
authority to decide on their respective provisional measures requests. '°? The Tribunal
is therefore satisfied that it has the power under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention to

rule on the Claimants’ and the Respondent's Applications.

It is generally accepted that Article 47 of the ICSID Convention confers a broad
discretion on the Tribunal to grant provisional measures. '** However, this power
must be exercised in a manner consistent with the very nature of provisional
measures, i.e. they are measures granted before parties have had the full opportunity

to present their respective cases.‘ In this regard, the Tribunal recognises that

provisional measures are extraordinary measures which ought not to be granted

lightly.19°

B. The Claimants’ Application

(1) No imminent risk of harm

In order to succeed in obtaining provisional measures, the requesting party must

show that the provisional measure sought is both urgent and necessary.

Although these requirements are not set out in express terms in the ICSID
Convention, it is well-established'®” that an order of provisional measures will only be
granted if the measure sought is necessary to preserve a party’s rights and where
the need is urgently required to avoid serious or irreparable harm. In the words of the

ICSID tribunal in Occidental v Ecuador.'*

“It is also well established that provisional measures should only be
granted in situations of necessity and urgency in order to protect rights
that could, absent such measures, be definitely lost...In other words, the
circumstances under which provisional measures are required under Article
47 of the ICSID Convention are those in which the measures are necessary
to preserve a party’s rights and where the need is urgent in order to
avoid irreparable harm. The jurisprudence of the International Court of
Justice dealing with provisional measures is well established: a provisional
measure is necessary where the actions of a party “are capable of causing or
of threatening irreparable prejudice to the rights invoked”. A measure is
urgent where “action prejudicial to the rights of either party is likely to be
taken before such final decision is given”. [Emphasis added.]

Similarly, the ICSID tribunal in PNG v Papua New Guinea stated that:'°

“The requirements of necessity and urgency are also well-established...it is
well-established that an order of provisional measures will only be
granted if these measures are necessary to preserve the requesting
party’s rights, and are urgently required to avoid serious harm’.
[Emphasis added.]
As the tribunal in PNG v Papua New Guinea observed, there are variations in
approach or the precise wording used by the ICSID tribunals as to whether the
requirement is that of “irreparable harm”, or whether a demonstration of “serious”
harm will suffice. Regardless of what the exact terminology should be, the Tribunal
agrees with the reasoning of the tribunal in PNG v Papua New Guinea that the term
“irreparable” harm must be understood as requiring a material risk of “serious or
grave damage to the requesting party, and not harm that is literally “irreparable”. "4°
The degree of “seriousness” or “gravity” required will necessarily vary from case to

case, depending on the circumstances of each case and the nature of the relief

requested.

Further, in view of the twin requirements of urgency and necessity, it must follow that
the harm alleged by the requesting party must be “imminent”, and not “potential or

hypothetical”. As the tribunal in Occidental v Ecuador rightly noted: "4"

“Provisional measures are not meant to protect against any potential or
hypothetical harm susceptible to result from uncertain actions. Rather,
they are meant to protect the requesting party from imminent_harm.”

The Tribunal now addresses requests (a) to (d) of the Claimants’ Application

(collectively, the “Claimants’ Requests’), '*? namely:

(a)

(c)

(a)

that all ongoing works for the Project be immediately brought to a halt
pending the final outcome of the arbitration proceedings (“Claimants’

Request A”);

that the Respondent, during the pendency of this arbitration, refrain from
calling any bonds issued by the Claimants for and in relation to the Project

(‘Claimants’ Request B”);

that the Respondent, during the pendency of this arbitration, refrain from
applying further delay penalties, including those which it has, to date,

postponed (“Claimants’ Request C’”); and

that the Respondent, during the pendency of this arbitration, refrain from
implementing a retroactive negative variation order in relation to the SBS

Method (“Claimants’ Request D”).

Having reviewed the evidence and considered the submissions made by the Parties,

the Tribunal is not satisfied that there is any imminent risk of harm justifying the

Claimants’ Requests A, B, C and D. The burden rested on the Claimants to make out

their case of urgency and necessity and the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have

failed to do so.

145

First, it is not disputed that the delay penalties have been expressly deferred. This
fact and the Claimants’ inability to produce any credible evidence that that situation is
about to change fatally undermines the Claimants’ Request C. Whilst the Claimants
have expressed the fear that they may be required to pay the delay penalties soon,
that is no substitute for evidence. The Tribunal also records that the Respondent had
stated in its briefs'** that the MPW will only deduct delay penalties once the Project
achieves completion. Indeed, the Respondent's Counsel repeatedly made clear
during the Hearing that the Respondent has no intention to impair the Claimants’
cash flow. For example, Respondent's Counsel stated at the Hearing that: “more
than anything else, MPW wants the Claimants to finish the Project. It doesn’t want to
drive them out and it doesn’t want to impair their cash flow. They need that to finish.
That would be counter-productive. MPW wants this project to proceed to completion

in the normal course”.'4

Secondly, it is also not disputed that the “negative variation order” in respect of the
SBS Method has not yet been imposed, and that the issue has been under
discussion for two and a half years. Again, there is no evidence that the Respondent
is about to issue such a variation order and in the absence of that, it is not
appropriate to grant interim measures. Thus, the Claimants’ Request D must be

dismissed.

The Tribunal is fortified in its conclusion by the fact that the Claimants themselves
say that there is merely a “potential” that the Respondent would apply the negative

variation order. The Claimants’ Reply on Provisional Measures states at [38]:'4°

See, for example, the Respondent's Response to the Claimants’ Request for Provisional Measures
dated 10 May 2017 at [23].

“37. In short, continuing the Project involves the continuous input of
additional liquidity and the exponential growth of the financial burden
on Claimants.

38. This financial stress, along with a potential call on the bonds and the

potential application of a negative variation order, is leading to
significant harm to Claimants.” [Emphasis added.]

Further, even if a negative variation order were to be subsequently applied, there is
no evidence before the Tribunal how that would be implemented - whether the
negative variation order would be deferred until the end of the Project, whether it
would be gradually deducted from progress payments over the course of the Project
or whether it would be applied immediately. All this must lead to the conclusion that

on order in the terms of the Claimants’ Request D is not warranted.

Thirdly, it is not disputed that, to date, there has been no attempt by the Respondent
to call on any of the bonds. There is no credible evidence that the bonds are about
to be called, nor is there any evidence that the Respondent had articulated any threat

to call on the bonds.

The Claimants did refer the Tribunal to MPW Internal Circular 15/2016,'4° and argued
that “[i]f the [Respondent] were to decide to seek payment of [the outstanding delay
penalties and the negative variation order], it would most likely do so by calling the
project bonds”. '47 However, as set out above, there is no evidence that the
Respondent is about to call for payment of delay penalties which it has expressly

deferred, nor that the Respondent is about to issue a negative variation order.

In the course of the Hearing, the Tribunal asked if the Respondent would be willing to

provide some notice prior to a call of the bonds posted by Claimants for the

Letter from MPW No. 6/3/193/4300 dated December 6, 2016, Exhibit R-10.

Project. '*® Having taken instructions after the Hearing, the Respondent's Counsel
confirmed, by way of a letter dated 9 November 2017, that the Respondent “would be
willing to make a good will gesture in regard to a potential call on any of the four
bonds that have been issued on behalf of Claimants in favor of MPW, namely: the
performance bond (having a value of approximately US$80 million), the advance
payment bond (currently valued at US$18.5 million), and the two retention bonds
(collectively amounting to US$43 million)” and to provide “10 days advance notice” to
the Claimants in the event that circumstances arose in which the Respondent
decided to call on any of the four aforementioned bonds. This is not something
required by the contractual documentation which permits the Respondent to call on

the bonds without any prior notice to the Claimants.

In the premises, including in light of the Respondent's undertaking discussed above,
the Tribunal is not convinced that there is an imminent risk of harm justifying the
Claimants’ request that the Respondent be ordered to refrain from calling any bonds
issued by the Claimants for the Project. The Claimants’ Request B must therefore be

dismissed.

Fourthly, in respect of the Claimants’ Request A (i.e. that the works on the Project be
suspended), the Claimants assert that they are unable to sustain progress on the
Project any longer as the Claimants are incurring “huge daily losses” amounting to
over USD 109,000 every day.'° As a result, the only viable option is to “alleviate the
cash flow burden currently forced upon the Claimants by suspending the works until

such time as these arbitration proceedings are concluded”. °°

To found this argument, the Claimants pointed to a one-page “summary table” of the
“JV’s Income and Liabilities between January and July 2017”, a document created for
the purposes of this arbitration, to support their assertion that the Claimants have
suffered daily losses of USD 109,000.'®' The Claimants highlighted row 4 of the table
which provides that “pending payments to suppliers, subcontractors and service

providers” in the period January to July 2017 amount to KWD -1,129,022.028:

In the Tribunal’s view, the evidence presented is not sufficient to show that the
Claimants are in fact incurring daily losses amounting to over USD 109,000 every
day, or that the Claimants are not able to sustain progress on the Project any longer
because of these losses. The Tribunal is similarly unconvinced that these alleged

daily losses can be attributed to the Respondent.

The Tribunal notes, in particular, that the alleged daily loss of USD 109,000 is
derived by simply taking the difference between: (i) the JV’s net income from the
MPW; and (ii) outflows of funds from the JV over a 7-month period, and deducing a

“daily outstanding average” from that figure. '*? However:

(a) first, it has not been made clear to the Tribunal what payments were made by
the JV set out at rows 2 and 3 of the “summary table” and whether those

payments were made for the Project;

(b) secondly, the Claimants were unable to explain to the Tribunal how much of
the KWD -1,129,022.028 (at row 4 of the “summary table”) is caused by the
Respondent. When the question was posed at the Hearing, Claimants’
Counsel conceded that they have not been able to come up with the definite

figures at this stage;'5°

(c) thirdly, the Claimants’ position is that the “pending payments” set out at row 4
of the “summary table” are in fact “outgoing payments”, '** and they are
recorded as a loss because the payments exceed the revenues. '®> However,
the summary table also records that the “outgoing payments” are in the
positive in the months of February, April and May 2017. This must necessarily
mean that the Claimants have received payments from their suppliers,

subcontractors and service providers in those months; and

(d) fourthly, the “summary table” merely shows that the JV’s cash flow was in the
negative from January 2017 to July 2017. There was no analysis of how this
snapshot of 7 months represented a complete picture. There could after all
be a mismatch in timing between expenditure and income across the life time

of a project like this.

Crucially, the Claimants did not provide any evidence or financial analysis that such a
loss would result in the JV or the Claimants being unable to survive. It seemed that
the Tribunal was being asked to infer simply from the size of the loss asserted that
there would be a serious impact on the JV and the Claimants. However, the loss
asserted was not compared in any meaningful way to the financial state of the JV or
the Claimants and thus the Tribunal was left in the dark as to the effect of this loss on

the JV and the Claimants.

The Claimants relied on the test set out in Micula v Romania'® to argue that “the
protection of a business as a going concern justifies the recommendation of

provisional measures”.

The Tribunal is willing to adopt the reasoning in Micula v Romania. However, the
difficulty for the Claimants was that they simply did not present sufficient evidence to
show that interim measures were necessary to protect the Claimants as going

concerns.

There was no evidence that Trevi and OHL were in a precarious financial position.
The most that was said for OHL was that if the bonds were called upon, that would
result in a reduction in the value of its shares. That is far from the threshold

established in Micula v Romania.

There was some evidence before the Tribunal of Rizzani’s financial situation, though
this was rather belatedly introduced. First, the Respondent introduced into the record

a copy of Rizzani’s Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements for the

loan Micula and Others v Romania, |CSID Case No ARB/05/20, Decision on Provisional Measures, 2
March 2011 at [68], as quoted in F. Campolieti, “The Rule of Non-Aggravation of the Dispute in ICSID
Arbitration Practice”, ICS/D Review, Vol. 30, No. 1, 2015, pp217-230, p. 223, Legal Authority CL-44.

Financial Year 2016 dated 12 June 2017 (“Rizzani’s FY2016 Financial
Statements’). *” If Rizzani was truly on the brink of insolvency, it would be
reasonable to expect that these financial statements would have indicated that
clearly to the shareholders of Rizzani. However, there was no such disclosure in

these financial statements.

Secondly, the Claimants introduced into the record Rizzani’s Consolidated Stand-
Alone Semi-annual Financial Statements as at 30 June 2017 (“Rizzani’s June 2017
Financial Statements”)'®®. This was in response to the Respondent's reliance on

Rizzani’s FY2016 Financial Statements.

The Claimants pointed to the fact that Rizzani’s FY2016 Financial Statements
reflected a negative net financial position of €74 million on 31 December 2016, and
Rizanni’s June 2017 Financial Statements reflected a negative net financial position

of €141 million by June 2017.

However, the fact that Rizzani has a net negative financial position does not mean
that it is insolvent, a position that the Claimants’ Counsel candidly agreed with. 1°
Further, the Claimants’ Counsel responding to questions from the Tribunal
represented that the increase in Rizzani’s negative financial position from €74 million
to €141 million was because of “increased borrowing” as Rizzani is “growing”.'® The
picture that emerged is thus of a company which is getting new projects and which is
borrowing money to fund those projects. This is far removed from the situation of

financial distress.

The Tribunal was told that Rizzani has more than USD 400 million of existing bonds
covering all the various projects it is involved in worldwide. The Claimants
represented that for some of the other projects, Rizzani had provided bonds of similar
quantum as compared to the Project in Kuwait. The Claimant asserted that if there
was a call on the bonds in any of those projects (not just the Kuwait Project), this
would lead to Rizzani’s insolvency.'®' Such assertions did not prove that Rizzani
was in a delicate financial position. If anything, these assertions indicate that the
grant of the provisional measures requested by the Claimants would not remove the

danger that the Claimants were alleging.

Perhaps most crucially, the Claimants did not provide any analysis on the specific
tipping point at which Rizzani would slide into insolvency and cease to be a going
concern. In fact, the Claimants accepted that there are no allegations or evidence in
their submissions as to a specific tipping point. The Claimants have simply not
produced any evidence or analysis of what quantum of delay penalties and/or bonds
being called would be financially unbearable to Rizzani and which would then send
Rizzani into insolvency. Without clear evidence of this, the Tribunal cannot assume
that even if the Respondent called on the bonds and/or demanded immediate

payment of delay penalties, it would result in Rizzani’s demise.

In the premises, the Micula v Romania test was not satisfied in this case.

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal concludes that there is no imminent risk

of harm justifying the Claimants’ Requests A, B, C and D. The Claimants’ Requests,

as set out at paragraphs 58(a) to (d) of the Claimants’ Request for Provisional

Measures, must therefore be rejected.

(2) Alleged right to non-aggravation of the dispute

In their request (e), as set out at paragraph 58(e) of the Claimants’ Request for
Provisional Measures, the Claimants seek an order from the Tribunal refraining the
Respondent and/or their agencies or entities from engaging in any other conduct that
aggravates the dispute between the Parties and/or alters the status quo (“Claimants’

Request E”).

It was not contested that provisional measures can be granted in order to avoid
aggravation of a dispute. This general principle has been set out in the following

terms by the ICSID tribunal in Victor Pey Casado v Chile:'®

“It relates to the general principle, frequently affirmed in international case-
law, whether judicial or arbitration proceedings are in question, according to
which “each party to a case is obliged to abstain from every act or
omission likely to aggravate the case or to render the execution of the
judgment more difficult’. [Emphasis added.]
The Tribunal is not convinced by the evidence presented by the Claimants that the
Respondent is engaged in conduct that aggravates the dispute and/or alters the
status quo. Moreover, given that both Parties have each sought an order from the
Tribunal requiring the other party to refrain from engaging in any conduct that

aggravates the dispute and/or alters the status quo, the Tribunal expects that the

Parties are aware of their obligations not to aggravate the dispute in the course of

these arbitration proceedings and that they will act in compliance with those
obligations. The Tribunal thus declines at this stage to make an order in respect of

Claimants’ Request E.

Cc. The Respondent’s Application

(1) Exclusivity of ICSID proceedings

As has been recognised by numerous ICSID tribunals,'™ the right to exclusivity of
ICSID proceedings under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention can be protected by

way of provisional measures. Article 26 of the ICSID Convention provides:

“Article 26
Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless
otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of
any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local
administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration
under this Convention.”
Turning to the first four provisional measures sought by the Respondent in the
Respondent's Application (as set out at paragraphs 207(i) to (iv) of the Respondent’s

Rejoinder to the Claimants’ Request for Provisional Measures and Request for

Provisional Measures), the Respondent seeks orders requiring the Claimants to:

(a) withdraw any and all proceedings against the Respondent or any of its
governmental subdivisions relating to the dispute that is the subject matter of
this arbitration that have been commenced in the courts of Milan, Italy, as well

as any such other proceedings that have been commenced before any other

national court or authority in any country, whether judicial, administrative or
otherwise, during the pendency of this arbitration, in violation of the ICSID
Convention and/or the exclusive jurisdiction clause of the Contract

(‘Respondent’s Request I”);

vacate the ex parte judgments obtained in the court in Milan, Italy

(‘Respondent's Request II”);

inform the Tribunal and Respondent as to whether any other proceedings
relating to the dispute that is the subject matter of this arbitration have been
commenced before any national court of authority, whether judicial,
administrative or otherwise, during the pendency of this arbitration

(“Respondent's Request III”); and

refrain from commencing any other proceedings relating to the dispute that is
the subject matter of this arbitration before any other national court or
authority in any country, whether judicial, administrative or otherwise, during
the pendency of this arbitration, in violation of the ICSID Convention and/or
the exclusive jurisdiction clause of the Contract (“Respondent’s Request

Iv’).

The Tribunal notes that during the second day of the Hearing, the Respondent's

Counsel confirmed,'® in response to the Tribunal’s questions, that if the Claimants,

through their Counsel, represented on record that the two ex parte orders obtained

by Rizzani and Trevi in Milan, Italy were no longer in effect and that the Claimants

137.

139.

166
167

were no longer taking any part in the proceedings that were ongoing in Italy, the

Respondent would “withdraw the request to vacate the Milan court proceedings”.

The Claimants’ Counsel, Mr Silva Romero and Mr Michelangelo Cicogna,

subsequently made the following representations on record during the Hearing:

“MR SILVA ROMERO: ...The first way is that regarding Rizzani de Eccher,
the decision was revoked and the deadline for filing an appeal already
elapsed, and Rizzani didn’t file an appeal because of the commitment that
we had made in our papers not to pursue those actions now that we have the
ICSID Tribunal constituted.

Regarding Trevi and then — yes, Michelangelo wants to add something.

MR CICOGNA: Regarding Trevi, the representation is the following, and the
commitment, if you wish. The court revoked the Trevi order, the court is
the same judge, the same person, same day. Trevi, for the reason just
mentioned by Mr Silva Romero, decided not to appeal and the appeal
period for Trevi is expired.

BNP bank, Banca Popolare di Milano, did appeal on the costs and on clerical
orders of the record. The hearing is fixed on 22nd November. Trevi could, in
theory, appear — not appeal, but appear — by November 20th. Should Trevi
appear, they could only have a discussion on the limited grounds of appeal of
Banca Popolare di Milano, which means cost of the clerical errors, so not we
discuss the merits, because its principal term for appeal expired, and Trevi
shall not appear.

| think clearer than that | couldn't be.” [Emphasis added.]

In addition, Mr Silva Romero also represented at the end of the Hearing that he was
not aware of any other proceedings presently pending in any other jurisdictions

relating to this arbitration. 1°”

Having recorded the Claimants’ representations made through their Counsel at the
Hearing, and in light of the Respondent's Counsel's answers to the Tribunal’s
questions as set out at paragraph 136 above, the Tribunal is of the view that the

Transcript of hearing, 4 November 2017, p 121 line 4 to p 122 line 4.

141.

142.

issues relating to Respondent's Requests |, Il and Ill are now moot. Consequently, it
is not necessary for the Tribunal to make any orders in respect of Respondent's

Requests I, II and Ill.

As for Respondent’s Request IV, the Tribunal reiterates that Article 26 of the ICSID
Convention provides that “[c]onsent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention
shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the
exclusion of any other remedy’ (emphasis added). It is not disputed, and the Tribunal

emphasizes, that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention remains binding on all Parties.

Having said that, in the absence of any evidence of other proceedings relating to this
arbitration having been commenced by the Claimants, and having regard to the
Claimants’ Counsel's representations set out at paragraph 138 above, the Tribunal is
of the view that it is not necessary for any order to be made in respect of

Respondent’s Request IV.

(2) Continuation of works

The Tribunal shall now address request (v) of the Respondent's Application, which is
set out at paragraph 207(v) of the Respondent’s Rejoinder to the Claimants’ Request
for Provisional Measures and Request for Provisional Measures (“Respondent’s
Request V”). Specifically, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal issues an order
requiring Claimants to “[c]ontinue to perform works on the Project duly required under
the Contract and in accordance with the present program of works scheduled for

completion by February 2019”.

61

143.

144,

145.

168
169

In the course of the Hearing, through their Counsel, the Claimants represented that
even if the Tribunal were to deny the Claimants’ request for suspension, the
Claimants would eventually have “no other rational choice but to stop the works”
(emphasis added).'® The Respondent's Counsel characterised this as an “express
statement of an intention to walk away” by the Claimants which was tantamount to
the “repudiation” of the Contract.'®® The Tribunal is not prepared to find that the
Claimants’ caveated statement goes so far as to say that the Claimants will, to
borrow the Respondent's Counsel's words, “walk away” from the Project should the
Tribunal deny the Claimants’ request for suspension of the works. It appeared to the
Tribunal that the Claimants were saying that they would be compelled by the
circumstances to stop work and the Tribunal understood this to be a reference to the

Claimants’ arguments of their difficult financial situation.

In any event, even if the statement was meant in the way that the Respondent
interpreted it, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that irreparable harm would be

caused to the Respondent in the event that the Claimants stop work on the Project.

First, even if the Claimants would eventually repudiate the Contract, there is nothing
prohibiting the Respondent from terminating the Contract and taking steps to hire a
replacement contractor. In this regard, Mr Faulkner (the Respondent's witness)
testified at the Hearing that if the Claimants were to walk away from the Project now,
there is “at this time...probably a good opportunity for a replacement contractor
because obviously there are already contractors working on either side of Jamal
Abdul Nasser Street...and also there are several new contracts with elevated bridges
which are now starting in Kuwait”. Mr Faulkner also testified that the “expected”

period for the Respondent to get a replacement contractor in place to continue the

Transcript of hearing, 3 November 2017, p 23 lines 17 to 23.
Transcript of hearing, 4 November 2017, p 89 lines 10 to 13.

62

works would be “between three to six months”.'”° The “expected” period may shorten
if MPW were to take the view that a contractor is unlikely to complete their works,
given that MPW would “surely” be “looking to get somebody on board earlier and be

making preparations”.'7'

146. Secondly, there is also nothing prohibiting the Respondent from invoking its
contractual remedies, such as the calling on the bonds that were posted by the
Claimants for the Project. In fact, the Claimants have, at the Hearing, emphatically

undertaken to maintain and “extend the bonds for the duration of the Project”:'”

“MR SILVA ROMERO: ...Lastly, in addition, | should end our opening
statement, members of the Tribunal, by insisting on two points that we say
show the good faith that the Claimants show in this very case. First,
Claimants would agree, as | already said, to extend the bonds for the
duration of the Project. This commitment we wanted to be very clear
you’.

147. Thirdly, any prejudice suffered by the Respondent as a result of the Claimants’

repudiation of the Contract can be readily compensated by a monetary award.

148. For all these reasons, the Tribunal finds that there is no danger of irreparable harm
justifying the Respondent's request that this Tribunal issues an order requiring the
Claimants to perform works on the Project. The order sought is thus not necessary

and the Respondent's Request V must be denied.

(3) Maintenance of bonds

As for request (vi) of the Respondent's Application, i.e. that the Claimants continue to
maintain in place all bonds required by the Project (“Respondent’s Request VI”),'”°
this issue is now moot given the Claimants’ clear undertaking at the Hearing to
maintain and “extend the bonds for the duration of the Project”.'* No order from the

Tribunal in respect of this request is therefore required.

(4) Alleged right to non-aggravation of the dispute

Turning to request (vii) of the Respondent’s Application, i.e. that the Claimants refrain
from engaging in any other conduct that aggravates the dispute between the Parties
and/or alters the status quo, ‘'® as set out above at paragraph 133 above
(‘Respondent’s Request VII”), the Tribunal trusts that both Parties will not
aggravate the dispute in the course of these arbitration proceedings and sees no

need to make an order in respect of Respondent’s Request VII.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal finds, unanimously, after having reviewed
the evidence and the Parties’ respective arguments, that both the Claimants and the
Respondent have failed to demonstrate that any order for provisional measures is

justified in the circumstances.

Respondent's Rejoinder to the Claimants’ Request for Provisional Measures and Request for

Provisional Measures dated 21 June 2017 at [207(vi)].

Response to the Respondent's Request for Provisional Measures dated 4 September 2017, that
whether or not the Tribunal considers that the Respondent should be allowed to call the bonds during
the pendency of this arbitration, the Claimants will have no choice but to maintain all bonds in effect.

Accordingly, the Tribunal hereby rejects both the Claimants’ and the Respondent's

Applications in their entirety.

The Tribunal has, in its discretion, decided that the most appropriate costs order in
respect of both Applications is to order the Parties to bear their own costs arising
from these Applications. The Claimants and the Respondent will each bear one half

of the costs of the Tribunal and the Center arising from these Applications.
