6. The Claimant, by letter dated 12 April 2007, appointed Professor Piero Bernardini as an |

arbitrator. The Respondent, by letter dated 14 February 2007, appointed Mr Christopher
Thomas Q.C. as an arbitrator. Pursuant to Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules,
the two party-appointed arbitrators appointed Dr Michael Pryles as the third and presiding |
member of the Tribunal on 11 May 2007. All members of the Tribunal signed an Arbitrators |

Procedural Background

8. This arbitration arises from alleged violations of the Agreement on Encouragement and
Reciprocal Protections of Investments between The Kingdom of the Netherlands “4
("Netherlands") and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic dated 29 April 1991 (the "BIT"
or the "Treaty"). On 8 December 1994, the Czech Republic confirmed to the Netherlands that |
the Treaty remains in force for the Czech Republic as a successor state to the Czech and |
Slovak Republic. Article 8 of the BIT provides for the settlement of disputes as follows: |

 

Article 8

1) All disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other |
Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter shall if possible, be settled \
amicably.

2) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in

paragraph (1) of this Article, to an arbitral tribunal, if the dispute has not been
settled amicably within a period of six months from the date either party to the |
dispute requested amicable settlement.

3) The arbitral tribunal referred to in paragraph (2) of this Article will be constituted t
for each individual case in the following way: each party to the dispute appoints one |
member of the tribunal and the two members thus appointed shall select a national |
ofa third State as Chairman of the tribunal. Each party to the dispute shall appoint |
its member of the tribunal within two months, and the Chairman shall be appointed

within three months from the date on which the investor has notified the other |
Contracting Party of his decision to submit the dispute to the arbitral tribunal. |

4) If the appointments have not been made in the above mentioned periods, either
party to the dispute may invite the President of the Arbitration Institute of the
Chamber of Commerce of Stockholm to make the necessary appointments. If the
President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented
from discharging the said function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the
necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is a national of either Contracting
Party or if he too is prevented from discharging the said function, the most senior
member of the Arbitration Institute who is not a national of either Contracting Party
shall be invited to make the necessary appointments.

5) The arbitration tribunal shall determine its own procedure applying the
arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law
(UNCITRAL).

6) The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in
particular though not exclusively:

° the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;

. the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant Agreements
between the Contracting Parties;

° the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;

° the general principles of international law.

7) The tribunal takes its decision by majority of votes; such decision shall be final
and binding upon the parties to the dispute.
Disputes having arisen between the parties, the Claimant filed a Notice of Arbitration dated 14
February 2007.

In its Notice of Arbitration the Claimant stated that attempts to settle the dispute amicably
began on 29 July 2003, including a meeting held with the representatives of the Czech
Republic in Prague on 24 October 2003, and that there appeared to be little prospect for an
amicable settlement of the dispute,

Following constitution of the Tribunal a preliminary hearing was convened on 24 August
2007. At the hearing the claimant was represented by Mr Kenneth Fleuriet and Mr Craig Miles
of King and Spalding LLP. The Respondents were represented by Ludek Vrana and Dr Rupert
Bellinghausen of Linklaters.

Following the preliminary hearing the Tribunal made Procedural Order No I dated 30 August
2007 which provided, inter alia, that the language of the arbitration is English and, whilst the
place of the arbitration is Paris, France, the hearing will be heid in London, England.

Procedural Order No | also set out the following procedural timetable:

Both parties responded to these requests on 18 April 2008, largely without objection. The
Claimant, whilst stating that the "categories of documents requested by the Czech Republic
appear overly broad, and the relevance of a number of the categories is neither apparent nor
adequately explained", confirmed by letter dated 23 April 2004 that it had produced all of the
documents in its possession that were covered by the categories identified by the Respondent.
Similarly, by letter dated 18 April 2004 the Respondent produced all documents in its
possession that were responsive to the categories, except for documents held by the Czech
Office of the Protection of Competition or UOHS to use the Czech acronym ("OPC"), which
were subject to formal administrative procedures to facilitate their release. These documents
were provided to the Claimant on 16 June 2008.

Factual Background

47.

48.

In 1990, as a primary step in Czechoslovakia's transition from a communist to a market
economy, the Czechoslovakian banking system was reformed. The "monobank" system, in
which the central bank was responsible for both monetary policy and commercial banking, was
disestablished and privately owned commercial banks commenced operation in
Czechoslovakia. Union Banka, which commenced operations in 1991, was one of a number of
small banks that were established at this time.

The Czech banking system was plagued by instability and severe liquidity issues throughout
the 1990s and a number of banks collapsed, In an attempt to address these crises the Czech
government initiated three state aid programs, including two Consolidation Programs between
1991 and 1994, and between 1994 and 1995 and a Stabilisation Program between 1995 and
1998.

49.

50.

51.

52.

Under the First Consolidation Program the Czech government (and its successors, the Czech
Republic and the Slovak Republic) strengthened the balance sheets of the four largest banks
(Komereno banka, Ceskd sporitelna, Investicni a Postovno banka (IPB), and Ceskolovenska
obchodni banka).

On | January 1993, Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved into its constituent states: the Czech
Republic and the Slovak Republic. The Second Consolidation Program was thus implemented
by the newly formed government of the Czech Republic. It was similarly structured to the First
Consolidation Program and directed state aid to mid tier and small Czech Banks. A number of
insolvent small banks were acquired by other banks with the assistance of the CNB as part of
the program.

Under the Stabilisation Program state aid was provided to failing banks through Cesk4
Finanént, s.r.0 ("CF"), a wholly owned Czech Government entity. Under the stabilisation
program the CF purchased participant banks' poor quality (non-performing) assets at nominal
value, — a maximum of 110 per cent of the bank's registered capital. In return the bank would,
after seven years, repurchase at nominal value any assets that remained uncollected. This
arrangement had the effect of offering participant banks a seven year interest free loan.
Further, the banks had an obligation to accept and subsequently observe the terms and
conditions of a stabilisation plan.

The banks were obliged to allocate the funds received from the CF preferentially to well-
performing assets having higher liquidity and bearing fewer risks. The implementation of a
cautious investment policy should have improved the banks' liquidity and enabled them, in the
course of a seven year period, to create sufficient resources to re-transfer the non-performing

Programme,

The expansion of Union Banka

53.

34.

Against this back-drop, Union Banka expanded its operations within the Czech Republic. In
1995 it underwent internal restructure through the establishment, by Union Banka's
shareholders, of Union Group. This became the holding company of Union Banka.

Between 1996 and 1998, Union Banka acquired four distressed banks, Ekoagrobanka,
BDS and Forest The isitions of Ek banka, Evrobanka and BDS took

 

place under the aegis of the Second Consolidation Program. These acquisitions were made
pursuant to agreements with the CNB whereby the CNB agreed to compensate Union Banka
for the difference between the assets recorded on the banks' accounts and the value of those
assets as determined by independent audits. The purpose of this agreement was to mitigate the

55.

57.

58.

59.

losses Union Banka would have otherwise borne as a consequence of absorbing the non-

performing loan books of other banks.

In 1998, a dispute arose between Union Banka and the CNB about the terms of their agreement
in relation to Union Banka's acquisition of BDS. This matter was settled in December 1999
pursuant to the "BDS Settlement Agreement". The CNB had agreed to compensate Union
Banka for 85 percent of the difference between the book value of BDS’ balance sheet
liabilities and the value of its assets and goodwill, to be established by an independent audit.
Compensation was paid but Union Banka subsequently claimed a further amount. When the
CNB refused, the bank commenced and succeeded in an arbitral claim. The CNB complied
with the arbitral award but in doing so required Union Banka to sign a settlement agreement
recording their agreement that the settlement was final and binding.

In September 2002, while the principal events at issue in this arbitration were occurring, Union
Banka initiated further arbitral proceedings against the CNB in relation to the terms of the
BDS Settlement Agreement. Union Banka valued this claim at CZK 1.762 billion. This was
recorded in its books on 23 September 2002 (the "CNB Receivable") as is discussed further
below at paragraph 110. The CNB won that arbitration in April 2003.

Meanwhile, in late 1997, Union Banka entered into an agreement with CF, the state
consolidation agency, to acquire Foresbank as part of the broader Stabilisation Program.
However, in 1998 Foresbank was taken out of the Stabilisation Program and an alternative set
of agreements were concluded between Union Banka and CF.

Pursuant to these agreements, Foresbank repurchased its assets from the CF at the nominal
value of the uncollected assets, discounted from the original 2004 payment at 11.5 percent per
annum (a rate derived from the then prevailing market interest rate). The discounting of the
purchase price allowed Union Banka to retain the economic value of the interest free loan. In
addition it was agreed that (1) CF would deposit the proceeds from the sale of the loans back
to Union Banka, (2) the deposit (known as the "Fores Deposit") would mature on the original
2004 payment date and bear the same 11.5 percent per annum interest rate, and (3) the deposit
would be fully secured by Government Bonds. Under the terms of these agreements the Fores
Deposit, plus interest, would be worth CZL 1.591 billion to CF at maturity in December 2004.

By 2002, market interest rates had fallen to below 4 percent in the Czech Republic and Union
Banka was incurring significant losses on the Fores Deposit.

Union Banka's accumulation of related party loans

60.

61.

62.

63.

Throughout this same period Union Banka entered into a number of related party loans
("RPLs") with its shareholders or related parties for the purpose of purchasing shares in

Union Banka. The majority of these loans were under-secured and non-performing.

In its 1998 Audit Report, Union Banka valued the RPLs at approximately CZK 4.5 billion?
The CNB took remedial action against Union Banka. However, Union Banka's practice of
granting RPLs continued. By June 2000, the CNB quantified the RPLs at CZK 5.461 billion.?

In January 2001, the CNB took further remedial action against Union Banka and requested that
it confine its investment of the proceeds received from repayment of the RPLs or from the sale
of Union Group's shareholdings in other companies to assets with zero-risk weighting.’ On 31
May 2001, Union Banka was fined CZK 2.5 million by the CNB for providing new RPLs to
finance the purchase of Union Group shares.*

As a result of problems inherited from the acquired problem banks compounded with the
RPLs, Union Banka became a problem bank itself. It sought to address these issues through
state aid.

State aid discussions between Union Banka and CF in 2001

64.

65.

66.

During 2001, Union Banka put forward three separate proposals for state aid. Each involved
the assistance of CF in cleansing Union Banka's balance sheets.

First, in February 2001, Union Banka proposed that CF buy 100 percent of the shares of
Foresbank for its liquidation value thereby terminating the Foresbank Deposit early.°

Secondly, in October 2001, Union Banka proposed that Foresbank would purchase certain of
the assets of Union Banka, including a number that Union Banka acquired through the
takeovers of Ekoagrobanka, Evrobanka and Foresbank, CF would then acquire the Foresbank
for a purchase price of CZK 1.2 billion.”

dated24 October 2003.

67. Thirdly, in December 2001, Union Banka proposed the transaction which is referred to as the
CF Transaction whereby CF would relinquish its deposit arising from Union Banka's
acquisition of Foresbank in exchange for a portfolio of under-performing loans.’ This was
effectively a debt for cash swap which was premised on the Government having greater
leverage to recover under these loans than Union Banka. The Government could also seek to
acquire equity in the debtor companies (which were mostly state owned entities) in service of

the loans.
68. In these proceedings the CF Transaction was also referred to as the Foresbank Settlement.
Invesmart retained by Union Banka

69. In late 2001, Union Banka opted for a strategy whereby it would implement a restructuring
plan. The primary aim of the plan was to clean up Union Banka's balance sheet, bring its
internal governance in line with western banking standards and improve its profitability. In
particular, the management of Union Banka aimed to redevelop both its corporate and retail
banking enterprises by attracting additional customers and offering a broader range of services

including insurance and leasing services.”

70. In order to achieve this, Union Banka, with the support of the Czech Government, sought to
find an investor that would acquire Union Banka and assist with its restructuring.

7. Invesmart was hired as a consultant to Union Banka on 8 November 200] to assist with this
process. Under the terms of the consultancy agreement between Union Banka and Invesmart,

Invesmart was to:
(i) assist Union Banka in restructuring its debts;
(ii) conduct due diligence of the bank and its loan portfolio; and
(iii) prepare the bank for sale to a strategic investor.

72. Invesmart simultaneously entered into a share sale and purchase agreement ("SPA") with
certain shareholders of Union Group, effectively acquiring an option to buy their 70 percent
shareholding.” The Claimant made submissions that the purpose of this agreement was to
ensure that initiatives proposed by Invesmart could not be frustrated by shareholders of Union
Group or Union Banka.

73. Shortly after being appointed as Invesmart's CEO, met with Union Bank's
President, Ms Marie Parmova. At that meeting Ms Parmova informed » that the
Government and Union Banka were:

in the final stages of negotiating a deal with Cesk finanéni (the Foresbank
Settlement) that would address the problem of the underperforming loans that
Union Banka has unherited under the Czech Government's Consolidation and
Stabilization Programs and which would also rectify the issue of the excess interest
that Union Banka was having to pay on the Cesk4 finanéni deposit.!!
74, In December 2001, Invesmart commenced due diligence to determine the value of the bank.
Invesmart hired Emst & Young to undertake due diligence of Union Banka's loan portfolio.
Deloitte & Touche, Union Banka's external auditor, was retained to conduct additional reviews
of the bank's accounts, including an audit of Union Banka's books ("2001 Audit").

75. By February 2002, Invesmart was aware as a result of this due diligence that Union Banka had
neither properly characterised its RPLs as unsecured nor made adequate provision for the
unsecured credit it had extended. Emst & Young also established that a number of commercial
loans made by Union Banka required higher provision than Union Banka had recorded in its

accounts. '?
Invesmart's decision to acquire Union Banka

76. i ing these di in March 2002 decided to acquire Union Banka
in its own right. It planned to restructure the bank itself and then sell it to a strategic investor in
the short to medium term.'?

 

77, It was from this time onwards that the events that form the basis of Invesmart's complaints in
this arbitration transpired. These events include a complex array of communications between
Tnvesmart, Union Banka and various organs of the Czech Government regarding the provision
of state aid to Union Banka, as well as regulatory and private contractual steps that were taken
by Invesmart to acquire a controlling interest in Union Banka. In order to assess Invesmart's
claim it is necessary to consider the various "strands" of events that ultimately led to the
revocation of Union Banka's license.

78. These are:

(a) Invesmart's contractual arrangements with Union Banka and Union Group to
acquire a controlling interest in both entities;

The material facts are considered in turn below.

Invesmart's contractual arrangements to acquire Union Banka

79.

80.

81.

Invesmart contracted to acquire an indirect interest in the bank through two SPAs ("SPA A”
and “SPA B").'* These were concluded with different groups of shareholders of Union Group
on 9 and 10 May 2002. The transactions contemplated by both SPA A and SPA B were
structured with the specific purpose of cleansing the balance sheet of Union Banka and
addressing the RPL problem.

What was known as "SPA A” was an agreement with the selling shareholders to, in the future,
purchase 36.24 percent of the shares in Union Group.'* Invesmart was to pay two of the
shareholders CZK 600 million for their shares. Both of these shareholders were debtors of
Union Banka and Invesmart was to pay this part of the purchase price to Union Banka and the
remainder (approximately CZK 1 billion) to a third selling shareholder. This agreement was
unconditional. Invesmart was to place the purchase price in escrow by 17 June 2002 and to
unconditionally close the transaction on 24 June 2002, subject to the payment by Invesmart of
acontractual penalty of CZK 60,000,000 in case of failure to close by such date.

Under "SPA B" Invesmart agreed with the selling shareholders to, in the future, acquire 33.82
percent of the shares of Union Group.'® Four of the shareholders selling shares under SPA B
were also debtors of Union Banka. Their share of the purchase price (approximately CZK.

660 million) was to be used to repay the RPLs owed to Union Banka. The remainder

(i.e., approximately CZK 500 million) was to be released to the selling shareholders. Under the
terms of SPA B, Invesmart was to post a letter of credit under which it would pay the selling
shareholders by 17 June 2002. The payment itself was to take place by 9 December 2002.

Together SPA A and SPA B constituted an agreement to acquire 70 percent of Union Group
for CZK 2.833 billion.

In the following months SPA A and SPA B were amended.

In particular, on 27 May 2002 the SPAs were amended such that a cash payment, instead of the
letter of credit, was to be deposited in escrow under SPA B on 17 June 2002 and the closing
date under SPA A was postponed to 30 September 2002.

On 14 August 2002, Invesmart and Union Group's selling shareholders entered into Addendum
No 4 to the SPAs, Instead of making payment to the shareholders in exchange for their shares,
Invesmart would assume the shareholders’ debts under the RPLs "as soon as the CNB gives the

approvel with the taking over of debts by [Invesmart]". The Addendum was to become

 

effective upon approval by the shareholders of Invesmart. Thus, SPA A had also become
conditional.'*

On 14 October 2002, Invesmart and the selling shareholders entered into Addendum No 5 to
the SPAs. Invesmart was to assume the debts of the selling shareholders to Union Banka
without undue delay. Addendum No 5 was to become effective upon (1) the CNB's approval of
Invesmart's acquisition of control over Union Banka and assumption for selling shareholders’
debts and (2) approval of Invesmart's shareholders.'®

On 4 April 2002, Invesmart submitted to the CNB the first of three formal applications to

acquire a controlling interest in Union Banka.

Much is made in the Claimant's submissions about the CNB's ultimate decision to approve
Invesmart's acquisition of Union Banka on 24 October 2002. For this reason, it is worthwhile

setting out the surrounding facts to enable the CNB's decision to be viewed in context.

Pursuant to Czech Law No 215/89 Col. on Banks, Invesmart was required to obtain the CNB's

approval before it could acquire a controlling interest in Union Banka.
In 2002, Invesmart made three separate applications to the CNB to acquire Union Banka.

The first two applications, dated 4 April 2002 and 4 June 2002 respectively, were both rejected
by the CNB on the grounds that Invesmart had failed to furnish essential information relating
to the source of the funds with which it proposed to acquire Union Banka. This was a
significant omission because under Section 9(3)(c) of Decree of CNB No. 166/2002 Coll.,
dated 8 April 2002, an applicant seeking to acquire an interest in a Czech Bank was required to

submit:

documents on the origin of the applicant's funds from which the purchase of shares
of the bank or purchase of a share in an entity through which is acquired indirect
share in the bank...is to be covered.”

The CNB's decisions to reject Invesmart's first two applications were both subject to 15 day
appeal periods. These expired on 3 July 2002 and 22 October 2002 respectively. Despite
frequent requests by the CNB, Invesmart was unable to provide evidence of the provenance of
its funds, Instead, it sought to secure further government support and alternative forms of
finance to strengthen Union Banka's ailing balance sheets and complete the acquisition.

The following exchange of correspondence in relation to Invesmart's second application is

illustrative of this conduct:

(a) On 2 September 2002, CNB wrote to Invesmart requesting further information
regarding the source of Invesmart's funding for the acquisition of Union Banka.”!

(b) On 12 September 2002, Invesmart met with the CNB, At this meeting the CNB

warned that if Invesmart could not adduce evidence regarding the provenance of

(e)

its funds its application would be rejected.” The minutes of this meeting show
that Invesmart informed the CNB that its investors would not commit funds for the
transaction until a final decision regarding state aid was taken.

On this same day Union Banka wrote to CNB proposing that it would fund
Invesmart's acquisition of itself by replacing its existing RPLs with a new RPL to
Invesmart.”* This structure was rejected by CNB.”

On 16 September 2002, Invesmart wrote to the CNB requesting additional forms
of support from the Czech Government. Specifically, Invesmart requested that the
Czech Government "define" the financial commitment it would make to support
Union Group's Polish banking subsidiary, Bank Przemyslowy.”* It also requested
a guarantee from the CNB not to withdraw Union Banka's banking licence unless
there is a deterioration "of the Bank's financials" related to the activity of the new
management. By this letter Invesmart also informed the CNB that:

The Union Group acquisition will therefore be entirely covered by
Invesmart with its own asset [sic]. A Board Meeting and a Shareholder
Meeting have been called to increase the capital of the company of
additional 90 million euro.

In response to Invesmart's 16 September 2002 letter the CNB informed Invesmart
that:

.. any [state assistance] is primarily a matter for the Ministry of Finance,
requires approval of the Czech Government and must have the support of
the Office for Protection of Economic Competition.

On 4 October 2002, the CNB denied Invesmart's second application to acquire a controlling

interest in Union Banka on the basis that it had not received sufficient information about the

source of the funds that Invesmart would use to finance the acquisition. On the advice of

Governor Tima, Invesmart did not appeal this decision. Rather, it waited until the expiration
on 21 October 2004 of the 15 day appeal period for appeal of the decision dated 4 October
2002 to submit a new application.”*

On 22 October 2002, Invesmart submitted its third application for approval by CNB for it to
acquire a controlling interest in Union Banka.”” The application included Minutes of an
Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders that was convened by Invesmart on 16
October 2002. The application stipulated that the meeting was duly held and a resolution was
validly approved for a capital increase of "EUR 90 million by way of share premium upon sole
request of the Board of Managing Directors of the Company". further signed
and contemporaneously submitted to the CNB a declaration by Invesmart that:

The acquisition of 70% of Union Group, a.s. of the value of approximately EUR 90
million will be entirely funded by Invesmart B.V. with its own capital which has
been increased by the Sharholders Meeting of the Company on October 16, 2002
and it will be entirely subscribed by shareholders.”*

This was the only information submitted by Invesmart to the CNB as evidence of the

provenance of the funds that it would use to acquire a controlling interest in Union Banka.

The expiration of the appeal period and the consequential failure of Invesmart's second
application received significant public attention in the Czech Republic on 22 October 2002.

On that day Mlada fronta Dnes, one of the Czech national daily newspapers, reported that
Invesmart had confirmed that it did not appeal against the negative decision of the CNB.”°
was quoted as saying: "It is very complicated. It cannot be definitively said that we

do not continue in our negotiations. We are in contact with the CNB".

The CNB also publicly commented on the situation’at Union Banka. In the afternoon on 22
October 2002 a spokesperson for the CNB, Ms Alice FriSaufova, made the following comment
to the Czech media:

In this administrative proceeding the CNB did not grant its approval to Invesmart

for the acquisition of qualified interest in Union Banka because the investor failed

to provide the source of funding for the acquisition. As far as this proceeding is

concerned, the decision is final. This does nots however, preclude Tnvesmart from

filing a new application and i istrative on
granting the approval with the transfer of thes shares,*!

The parties agree that depositors of Union Banka commenced a run on Union Banka on 23
October which caused Union Banka to lose approximately CZK 1.7 billion in deposits.

Invesmart attributes this event to the comments made by Ms Fri¥aufov4. The Czech Republic
argues that the run was caused by public uncertainty generated as a result of the expiration of
the appeal period of Invesmart's second application.

It was in these circumstances that on 24 October 2002 the CNB approved Invesmart's

application to acquire a controlling interest in Invesmart.?

Union Banka's growing financial problems throughout 2002

103.

104.

105.

106.

107.

The October 2002 run occurred at the end of a period of declining financial fortunes for Union
Banka. In June 2002 it became apparent, as a result of Invesmart's due diligence, that its
financial situation remained impaired by RPLs to the value of CZK 2.5 billion.*®

On 6 June 2002, CNB delivered a report to Union Banka indicating that Union Banka had
extended new RPLs to certain of its shareholders and that, as a consequence, significant
additional funds (between CZK 160 billion and 1.878 billion) needed to be created by the
bank.

Invesmart responded by requesting replacement of Union Banka's board of directors. The CNB
was informed of this request™ and by letter dated 4 July 2002 informed Union Banka that it
too required that it replace all of the members of its Board of Directors.**

Union Banka's financial situation continued to deteriorate as Deloitte & Touche sought to
finalise its Union Banka's 2001 auditor's report. In the end an acceptable auditor's report for
the bank was only secured as a result of two transactions that Invesmart entered to support the
balance sheet of Union Banka.

First, on 13 August 2002, Invesmart entered into the Receivables Assignment Agreement with
Union Banka (the "Recei' Assi A "") under which h

“unconditionally agreed to purchase the portfolio of loans earmarked for assignment to CF for a

cash payment of CZK 1.2 billion, if by 1 December 2002 CF did not take. assignment of these
loans. As security for its promise to pay, Invesmart agreed to post a CZK 300 million bank
guarantee on the date of signing the Receivables Assignment Agreement. Invesmart's

under the ivables Assi A bined with the bank
guarantee, thus 'replaced’ provisions on the loan portfolio earmarked for transfer to CF for the

purposes of the audit. In effect, the Receivables Assignment Agreement removed the CF loans
from Union Banka's balance sheet.

Secondly, on 14 August 2002, and as is discussed at paragraph 86 above, Invesmart and Union
Group's selling shareholders entered into Addendum No 4 of the SPAs. Instead of making
payment to the shareholders in exchange for their shares, Invesmart would assume the
shareholders' debts under the RPLs "as soon as the Czech National Bank gives the approval
with the taking over of debts by [Invesmart]". The effect of this agreement, having been

 

entered into si ly with the Recei Assi A was to remove the

CF Transaction as a condition precedent to the acquisition of Union Group share by Invesmart.

The 2001 audit of Union Banka, dated 16 August 2002, was issued in explicit reliance on the
Receivables Assignment Agreement and Addendum No 4.** Specifically, the report was
qualified by a statement that in Deloitte & Touche's opinion Union Banka might not be able to
continue as a going concern absent Invesmart's capital entry into the bank."” However,
Invesmart did not issue the bank guarantee required under the RAA on 13 August 2002 or at
any time thereafter.* Moreover, when the 1 December 2002 deadline for the contemplated
assignment of the loan portfolio to CF passed and Invesmart became liable under the
Receivables Assignment Agreement to pay the CZK 1.2 billion it had agreed to pay, it failed to
do so. .

Union Banka's balance sheets were further supported by the entry of the "CNB Receivable" on
its books on 23 September 2002. This “receivable” was based on an amount sought by Union
Banka from the CNB which, having been rejected by the latter, resulted in an arbitration claim
quantified by Union Banka at CZK 1.762 billion against it.’ (Union Banka ultimately lost the
arbitration in April 2003.) On 22 October 2002, the same day that Invesmart submitted its third
application to the CNB and the day before the run on Union Banka took place, the CNB
requested that Union Banka de-recognise the CNB receivable in its accounts by 25 October
2002. Union Banka never took this action, even though the recording of a contingent asset
such as the CNB receivable was contrary to IFRS Standards,*!

Union Banka also failed to respond to the CNB's 4 July 2002 request to replace its Board of
Directors. Consequently on 27 September 2002 the CNB requested that Union Banka replace
all members of the Supervisory Board.

, Mr de Sury and Mr Piga were subsequently appointed to Union Banka's board
on 27 September 2002. On 8 October 2002 Mr Vavra was appointed CEO of Union Banka and
commenced further due diligence of the bank's loan portfolio.”

Negotiations for state aid between Invesmart and Czech Government agencies

113.

114.

115.

116.

The documentary record clearly shows that throughout 2002 the MOF was favourably
disposed to consider making a grant of state aid to Union Banka. In particular, on 12 April
2002, based on assessments of Union Banka's 2001 proposals, the MOF prepared a draft
proposal to Cabinet for the solution of the relationship between Union Banka and CF. This
proposal was based on the proposed CF Transaction.*? The MOF decided not to submit this
proposal to Cabinet. Union Banka was informed of this decision in May 2002.**

Parliamentary elections took place in the Czech Republic on 14 and 15 June 2002.

Notwithstanding the parliamentary elections, "wrote to Minister of Finance
Rusnok on 28 June 2008. In this letter * reiterated Invesmart's intention to
proceed with its investment in Union Banka and asked Minister Rusnok to reconsider if the
relationship between Union Banka and CF relating to the Fores Deposit could be resol ved.**

Following the elections, with effect from 15 July 2002 a new Minister of Finance, Mr
Bohuslav Sobotka, took office. After the change in leadership in July 2002, the MOF was

favourably disposed to considering 2 grant of state aid to U;

  

Banka. On 25 July 2008 First

Deputy Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, wrote to Invesmart stating that:

[The Government]...appreciates [Invesmart's] activity and I may confirm we are
ready to discuss your proposal in detail. Please do not hesitate and sent [sic] to the
Ministry of Finance and authorised an detailed project prepared in collaboration
with Union Banka. Ministry is Boing to submit it to the Czech government and
expects it will make final decision.“

117. In August 2001, Invesmart initiated more regular contact with Czech Government agencies
and negotiations with the newly elected Czech Government for the provision of state aid to

Union Banka commenced in eamest.

118. Invesmart submitted a three part proposal to the Czech Government on 20 August 2002 (the
"20 August Proposal"). The key parts of this proposal were as follows:

@ settle Union Bank's obligations under the Fores Deposit immediately by
payment of CZK 1,134 million (as opposed to the CZK 1,591 million
which Union Banka was obligated to pay on 31 December 2004 under

the existing contract);

(ii) sell problem loans taken over from the 4 small banks in aggregate
nominal value of CZK 1.6 billion (purchase price was not specified);
and

(iii) invest the amount freed by the early termination of the Fores Deposit

(ie., CZK 1,134 million) into subordinated debt of Union Banka of
unspecified maturity and bearing an 8 percent rate of interest, to be

modified on an annual basis.‘”

119. This proposal was rejected by the MOF on 24 September 2002 at a meeting between the MOF,
CKA and CNB. At that meeting Minister Sobotka informed the officials of the CKA and CNB
that the MOF would not accept the 20 August Proposal, but that it would be willing to submit
an alternatively structured state aid proposal to the Czech Cabinet. Specifically:

...the lowering of prospective interest to market rate was proposed for discussion.
The MOF was also willing to discuss a reduction in the principal amount of the
Fores Deposit by some CZK 400 million through a transfer of problem assets of
that amount.®

120. Minister Sobotka also indicated that any grant of state aid would be subject to OPC approval.”

On 25 October 2002, the day after CNB issued its regulatory approval, discussions resumed
between the MOF and Invesmart about the provision of state aid to Union Banka. A meeting
took place between Euro-Trend, the consulting group hired by Union Banka on 16 October
2002 to conduct the state aid negotiations,*! and First Deputy Minister of Finance Dr
DoruSka.” At this meeting Dr Doru8ka suggested possible forms of state aid. Specifically, a

combination of:
(a) lowering the interest rate on the Fores deposit; and

(b) the acquisition by CKA of a portfolio of non-performing loans at a value to be
determined by an independent expert plus a mark-up of CZK 650 million, less cost
of administration of the portfolio.?

On 1 November 2002, Union Banka submitted a state aid proposal to the MOF which totalled
CZK 1.2 billion (the "First Euro-Trend Proposal"). The proposal envisaged:

(a) lowering the interest rate on the Fores Deposit of 11.5 percent to a rate between
PRIBOR and a standard commercial rate;

(b) acquisition by CKA of a portfolio of non-performing assets at a price determined
by independent experts plus an additional amount of state aid; and

(c) withdrawal of the arbitration claim which Union Banka filed against the CNB on
25 October 2002 in connection with Union Banka's takeover of the BDS ( the
“BDS Arbitration Claim") discussed above at paragraph 110.°°

On 5 November 2002, a meeting took place between Union Banka, the MOF and the CKA
which was attended by Messrs Vavra (CEO of Union Banka), Nekovar (Euro-Trend), Oklestek
(Eurotrend), Janota (First Deputy Minister of Finance, Doru8ka (MOF), Majer (MOF),
Rezabek (CKA) and Svoboda (CKA). At this meeting the parties mooted the possibility of a
commercial settlement of the BDS Arbitration Claim as an alternative to the First Euro-Trend

Proposal.** The parties also discussed the regulatory requirement that any grant of state aid

this requirement was specified by the Czech Government.”

125. On 8 November 2002, the CNB, which had already informed Union Banka that it refused to
pay the “BDS Receivable” and had requested the bank to de-recognise it in its accounts by 22
October 2002, again advised Union Banka that it would not recognise nor settle the BDS
Arbitration Claim.** Due to the CNB’s objections, the BDS claim was subsequently removed
from consideration as a means of providing state aid. (It was later resurrected by Union Banka

in its Restructuring Plans.)

126. On 13 November 2002, the CEO of Union Banka, Mr Vavra, again met with staff of the CNB.
At this meeting, Mr Vavra informed officials of the CNB that the new Euro-Trend proposal
that was about to be circulated would not include the settlement of the BDS Arbitration claim
and that Union Banka would limit its request for state aid to CZK 650 million. According to
the statement of Mr Vavra, Union Banka was prepared to limit its request for state aid to CZK.
650 million in order to avoid any further delay to the completion of the Foresbank settlement.

127. On 14 November 2002 Euro-Trend submitted to the MOF an amended proposal (the "Second
Euro-Trend proposal") for the provision of state aid. This proposal was for the Czech
Republic to provide aid in an amount not exceeding CZK 650 million on the following terms:

(a) the lowering of the interest rate applied to the Fores Deposit to a floating market
rate; -

(b) early termination of the Fores Deposit and its transformation into a five year
subordinated debt;

(c) the acquisition by the Czech Consolidation Agency (“CKA™”) of a portfolio of non-

performing assets at a price determined by independent experts plus an additional
amount of state aid; and

@ a state guarantee of a portfolio of loans.”

On 18 November 2002, Invesmart officially acquired approximately 60 percent of the shares
of Union Group, which owned approximately 75 percent of Union Banka at that time.
Invesmart also directly acquired approximately 22 percent of the shares in Union Banka. At
the CNB's request, the purchase price paid by Invesmart for the shares in Union Banka was to
be used exclusively to pay back Union Banka's RPLs.*!

Invesmart never paid for the shares it acquired in Union Banka.

Continued negotiations regarding State Aid

On 28 November 2002, Mr Vavra met with officials of the CNB. At that meeting the CNB
informed Mr Vavra that the OPC would provide its opinion on the feasibility of state aid. The
CNB informed Mr Vavra that there were three obstacles to the provisions of state aid:

(a) the "one time, last time" rule, meaning that prior recipients would be denied future
grants of state aid;

(b) the prohibition against state aid where losses were the result of intra-group
transfers; and
(c) the aid provided must be sufficient for the bank to continue as a going concern.

On 29 November 2002, another meeting took place between representatives of the Ministry for
Finance, the OPC, the CNB, the CKA, Union Banka and Euro-Trend. At that meeting the OPC
informed Union Banka that it would assess the Second Euro-Trend Proposal against the EC
Guidelines on State Aid for Rescuing and Restructuring Firms in Difficulty. The OPC also
offered rescue aid to Union Banka, Union Banka did not accept this offer but asked for three
months to prepare a restructuring plan that would be verified by its auditor.

Following the meeting of 29 November 2002, Union Banka began drafting a new restructuring
plan that was directly based on the various EU guidelines relating to state aid.

Between 7 January 2003 and 12 February 2003, Invesmart submitted three altemative
restructuring plans to the MOF and CNB.

The first of these was submitted on 8 January 2003 ("The First Draft Restructuring Plan")
along with a third proposal for the provision of state aid (the "Third Euro-Trend Proposal").

The Third Euro-Trend Proposal envisaged that the Czech Government would implement one

or more of the following measures:

(a) a significant decrease of the fixed interest rate on the Fores Deposit or its

reduction to zero;

(b) the early termination of the Fores Deposit and its transformation into five year
subordinated debt;
(c) the acquisition by CKA of a portfolio of non-performing assets at a price

determined by independent experts; and
(d) the purchase of the BDS Arbitration Claim by cr.

The First Draft Restructuring Plan identified the settlement of the BDS Arbitration Claim as
the proposed mechanism through which the Czech Government would provide state aid to
Union Banka.

On 23 January 2003, Union Banka delivered a "Second Draft Restructuring Plan" which
envisaged the provision of state aid to the value of CZK 1.691 billion which was to be

provided via:
(a) settlement of the BDS Arbitration Claim; or
(b) a guarantee from the Czech Republic covering a portfolio of non-performing
loans.”

The MOF provided comments on both the First and Second Restructuring Plans at a meeting
held on 28 January 2003.

On 12 February 2003, Union Banka submitted its third and final restructuring plan to the MOF
("Third Restructuring Plan") in which Union Banka proposed settlement of the BDS
Arbitration Claim or, in the alternative, a state guarantee. The settlement of the BDS
arbitration was proposed notwithstanding the CNB's clear statement of 8 November 2002 that

it would not recognise or settle the BDS Arbitration Claim on a commercial basis. The
amount of state aid requested totalled CZK 1.762 billion.”

The Third Restructuring Plan demonstrated that Union Banka's new management led by new
CEO Mr Vavra had carried out an in depth inspection of the bank and had decided to create
extra adjustments to cover bad loans worth CZK 1.8 billion.”' It specifically noted that:

The proposed figures for adjustments and provisions to be created considerably
exceeds the previously anticipated figures, primarily as a result of the more realistic
approach towards the quality of the assets and risk of the Bank's portfolio adopted
by the new management team for restructuring.””

The plan acknowledged that new management were of the opinion that Union Banka's
situation was more dire than originally expected.

Union Banka's liquidity crisis and the denial of state aid

141.

142.

By 19 February 2003, it was clear that there was a growing liquidity crisis at Union Banka. On
that day the assistant to Union Banka's CEO, Mr Vavra, sent a letter on his behalf to the
Minister's secretary, requesting a meeting with Minister Sobotka within the next 48 hours "in a
very urgent and pressing matter 'Crisis in Union banka.”

On the same day that his assistant requested the meeting with the Finance Minister, Mr Vavra
met with CNB officials. The meeting's minutes reveal the bank's deteriorating situation:

Mr. Vavra referred to the current development in the area of liquidity as to
catastrophical (sic). During the last two weeks (i.e., since the beginning of
February), the Bank registers a continuous drain of liquidity. The liquidity cushion
of the Bank is currently represented only by ca. CZK 550 min and if the situation
doecn't change fundamentally, i+

the judgment of Mr. Vavra. (Noi mid January, ai emt cushion of the Bank
was around ca, CZK 1.1 mln).

    
 

According to the statement of Mr. Vavra, corporate clients are leaving the Bank,
whereas deposits in the retail area grow; however, the total amount of deposits drain
represents ca. CZK 40 mln per day.

Mr. Vavra resumed the measures taken by the Bank to date:

- holdback of credit transactions since October 2002

- active effort to increase deposits by means of advertisement and interest rates
increase. (Note: the current deposits interest rates at the Union Bank are in rank 2x

higher than those by other banks with the highest rates on the market!)

However, the Bank is not currently able to prevent the deposits drain by the means
of the standard market mechanism...” [Underlining added; italics and bolding in

original]
Thus, on the bank's own view, its liquidity situation was "catastrophical". It was plainly facing
peril, and if no action was taken to stem the outflow of deposits, it faced the imminent prospect

of having to close down.

The minutes continue, recording Mr Vavra as advising that:

Ifreversion in the liquidity situation did not occur and no hope for public support
existed, there would be no other choice left than to "return the licence".

In this respect, he [Mr. Vavra] was wamed by the CNB that optional termination of
banking activities was possible only under the condition of settlement of all
obligations. Thus in the current.situation would come into question only
administrative hearing about the licence withdrawal, because for example legal
causes for the introduction of sequestration were not met (the stability of the
banking system was not endangered) (sic).’’ [Emphasis added.]

Mr Vavra's 19 February 2003 request for liquidity support from the CNB was denied.

At 3 pm on the following day, 20 February 2003, Union Banka's Supervisory Board,
comprising and Mr de Sury, met with Governor Tima and three colleagues
from the CNB.”° At that meeting, Governor Tima read them his copy of the Minister's letter
denying the aid which he had himself just received. The minutes record that the members of
the bank's Supervisory Board were not able to express their opinion regarding the impact of
this development on Invesmart's affiliation with Union Banka, "nor the possibility of the
bank's shareholders securing its liquidity".”” They indicated that they would keep the CNB

informed of their actions in the next few days.”*

This meeting was followed by a meeting between the CNB and Mr. Vavra at 4 p.m. He too
was informed of the Minister's rejection of the restructuring plan. According to the minutes,
Mr Vavra informed the CNB of:

...the critical situation of the bank with respect to its liquidity, when deposit
withdrawals by particularly corporate clients increased and in average, the value of
deposit values is daily decreased by approx. CZK 40 million. By October 2002, the
bank had already used all commercial measures, particularly limitation of loan

transactions in an active attempt to increase deposits through promotions and
increase of interest rates and the sale of quickly liquid assets, but it unable to
prevent further outflow of deposits. Other measures, particularly in the area of sale
of receivables or repo operations with respect to receivables, are not feasible within
the near future and do not resolve the situation of the bank.

.-. With regard to the above-mentioned situation, the bank is unable to fulfil its legal
obligation to maintain solvency and further operation of the bank would only harm
the position of its depositors.

The above statement is to be treated as notice under Section 26b of the Act No.
21/1992 Coll., as amended.

3. Mr. Vavra promised to discuss further steps by the bank at a meeting of the board
of directors immediately following this meeting and to inform shareholders and the
CNB.

4. The CNB acknowledged the above-mentioned facts and considers the eventual
decision of the bank to close its branches to be rational. If the bank decides to close
its branches, the CNB will immediately notify the Deposit Insurance Fund in order
to start the pay-outs of compensation to depositors as soon as possible to minimize
the impact on the depositors. Maximum information provided to the public is
considered important by he CNB and the CNB is ready to cooperate with the bank
in this area.

The CNB is interested in the most orderly exit of the bank from the sector with
minimum impact on the bank's depositors and the banking sector ...”° [Emphasis
added.)

148. In the evening of 20 February 2003, Union Banka's management met and decided not to open
branches the next day. They informed the CNB about this decision by letter prepared later that
same evening, with the time of 7 p.m., in which Mr VéBvra and two senior bank officers
stated: ©

. ty of the bank is continuousiy declining and this
trend has continued culminating for the last two weeks, we were informed today of
the decision of the State not to grant the bank the requested state aid. The decision
was publicized during the afternoon and makes a real possibility, according to our
recent experience, that a run on the bank will start on 21 February 2003. In
accordance with Section 26b of the Banking Act, we have. therefore, come to the
conclusion that the bank shall, as a result of the above-mentioned circumstances, in
all likelihood become insolvent tomorrow and we give you this information
pursuant to the above-mentioned Section 26b.

 
 

At the same time, in view of the last consultations with the Czech National Bank,
we are immediate measures pursuant t¢ Section 26 f the Bi Act and

 

effect from the next following business day— 21 February 2003 — we shal! ‘close :
branches of Union banka, the clearing centre, etc."' [Emphasis added.]

149. The following day, Union Banka closed all of its branches and the CNB initiated
administrative proceedings to revoke the bank's licence.*? The Deposit Insurance Fund was
notified that it might be required to compensate the bank's depositors and the CNB
commenced administrative proceedings to revoke the bank's licence,®*

150. It is evident that this notification did not find favour with Invesmart. Three days later, two of
the three signatories to the letter, Messrs Vavra and Roman Truhldf, were dismissed and
replaced by Mr Michal Gaube and Mr Roman Mentlik. It appears that the reason for their
dismissal lay in what considered to be "the fact that [the] members of the board

d

of directors whose dismissal was may take in ible steps, or legal acts

that would contradict the interests of Union banka, a.s., its shareholders and clients of Union
banka, a.s."**

151. There is further evidence of a disagreement between Mr Vavra and | “7 as to the
proper way to proceed. An article in the Czech publication, Tyden, dated 10 March 2003, later
quoted Mr Vavra as saying that the depositors in Union Banka:

..-Should hope for a quick revocation of Union banka's licence and quick payout
from the deposit insurance funds. ... This was precisely my logic, why I closed the
bank's branches, because the head of Invesmart ' and the CNB did
not do it. The branches were closed by me in order tor as much money as possible
to be saved. ... wanted to continue to keep the bank open. He did everything
to make that happen, gave me various orders from his post as the head of the
Supervisory Board. I firmly stood behind my view that under no circumstance
would I do that. ** [Emphasis added.]

152. On 24 February 2003, the first two applications for declaration of bankruptcy of Union Banka
were filed by creditors with the Regional Court in Ostrava.®®

Union Banka's attempts to renew its operation

153. On 27 February 2003, Union Banka presented a salvage plan to the CNB for the renewal ofits .
operations.” This plan was supplemented on three occasions during March 2003.

154. First, on 3 March 2003, Union Banka filed the plan with the CNB and commented on the
CNB's notice of the commencement of administrative proceedings to revoke Union Banka's
licence."* This plan was based on unverified data. It included a statement that the plan was
subject to change pending an external audit to verify the correctness of assumptions and
information presented therein.

155. Secondly, on 10 March 2003, Union Banka submitted a supplement to its plan to the CNB.”
This proposal envisaged Union Banka continuing to operate on a limited licence whereby it
would be prohibited from taking further deposits. It would pay out 100 percent of claims by
depositors itself and would finance payment of claims by depositors in excess of CZK 5
million per client under a five year loan agreement with the Bank Deposit Insurance Fund
(“FPV”). The Czech Government was not satisfied that Union Banka had funds to implement
this plan. Further, the proposal was inconsistent with provisions of the Czech Banking Act and
the law establishing the FPV.””

156. Thirdly, on 18 March 2003, informed the CNB that Invesmart had entered into a
memorandum of understanding with MTGLQ investors, L.P., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Goldman Sachs, to cooperate on a new plan.’ The CNB was informed of this plan once it had
already made its decision to proceed with the revocation of Union Banka's banking license,
which occurred on that same day.

157. On 27 March 2003, the FMV applied for Union Banka's bankruptcy before the Regional Court
in Ostrava. On 31 March 2003, Union Banka created provisions for debts assumed by
Invesmart as requested by CNB, resulting in negative capital of CZK1.29 billion.”

The fraudulent bankruptcy proceedings of Union Banka

158. The orderly bankruptcy of Union Banka was interrupted by proceedings commenced on 31
March 2003 before the Commercial Court in Usti Nab Labem. On that same day Judge Berka,
the presiding Judge, declared Union Banka bankrupt and appointed Daniel Thonat as the
bank's bankruptcy trustee. On 1 April 2003, Mr Thonat and a group of armed men forcibly
entered Union Banka's main office in Prague.

159. It is common ground that these proceedings were fraudulent and were only sustained on the
basis of forged documents. For this reason, Judge Berka annulled his bankruptcy decision on 4
April 2004. Further, on 8 April 2003, the President of the Czech Republic and Prime Minister
approved the removal of Judge Berka's immunity.” Judge Berka was subsequently prosecuted

for abuse of power by a public official.

160. On 14 April 2003, Union Banka filed an application for a voluntary composition with its
creditors with the Bankruptcy Court in Ostrava and a voluntary bankruptcy petition. The
members of Union Banka's Board of Directors who filed the voluntary bankruptcy petition
were recalled the same day and the petition for voluntary bankruptcy was withdrawn the same

day.
161. On 24 April 2003, Union Banka lost the BDS Arbitration Claim.”
162. On 28 April 2003, the Czech Securities Commission (""CSC") requested Invesmart to honour

its obligations to purchase shares in Union Banka tendered to it by the minority shareholders

who accepted Invesmart's mandatory tender offer.**
The revocation of Union Banka's banking licence and the liquidation of Union Banka

163. On 30 April 2003, the CNB Board rejected Union Banka's appeal of the CNB's decision of 18
March 2003 to revoke its banking licence. The revocation of Union Banka's licence became
effective on 2 May 2003.”

164, On 9 May 2003, the CNB filed a petition with the Regional Court in Ostrava to dissolve Union
Banka and appoint a liquidator.” On the same day, the Regional Court in Ostrava declared
Union Banka to have entered liquidation and appointed Value Added S.R.O. as liquidator.”
The decision came into effect on 19 May 2003. Union Banka did not appeal the decision.

Jurisdiction

Introduction

175.

176.

The Respondent has asserted that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide the case. In
its Statement of Defence, Statement of Rejoinder and at the hearing the Respondent put
forward several contentions for its assertion of lack of jurisdiction. In essence, three discrete

arguments have been raised:
@ the Claimant is not a Dutch investor;
(ii) the Claimant did not make an investment in the Czech Republic; and

(iii) the Claimant, through its actions in the Czech courts, is precluded from
arguing that it validly acquired the shares in Union Banka and its
holding company.

The Tribunal will deal with each of these arguments in tum.

Nationality

177.

178.

Article 1(b) of the BIT defines "investors" as follows:

(b) the term ‘investors’ shall comprise:

i. natural persons having the nationality of one of the Contracting
Parties in accordance with its law;

ii, legal persons constituted under the law of one of the Contracting
Parties.
It is not doubted that Invesmart is a legal person constituted under the law of The Netherlands,
However, the Respondent argues that the Claimant does not have any real connection to the
Netherlands and for that reason does not satisfy the notion of an "investor" pursuant to the
BIT. The Respondent argues that the Claimant has no real presence and no management in the

Netherlands, it being physically located in Italy and controlled by Italian nationals.

179.

180.

For its part, the Claimant relies on the wording of Article 1(b) of the BIT and on the fact that it
is constituted under the law of the Netherlands. The Claimant argues that there is no “origin of
capital" requirement in the BIT and no such requirement may be implied. It notes that the
Czech Republic's “origin of capital" argument was rejected by another tribunal's Decision on
Jurisdiction of 29 April 2004 in Tokios Tokelés v Ukraine.'®

This Tribunal considers that the words of Article 1(b) of the BIT are clear and that, in the case
of legal persons, the only requirement is that the legal person is constituted under the law of
one of the Contracting Parties. There is no basis for implying any further requirement.
Accordingly the Tribunal decides that the Claimant is an investor within the meaning of
Article 1(b) of the BIT,

Investment

181.

182.

In its Statement of Defence the Respondent contended that the Claimant never acquired
beneficial ownership of the shares in Union Banka and Union Group and made no substantive

in the sense of itting capital. The Respond that:

[a]s the Respondent has already shown in this Statement of Defence, Invesmart (i)
paid no purchase price for the shares, (ii) having agreed (at a shareholder meeting
held on 16 October 2002) to a EUR 90 million capital increase in order to allow the
Union Banka transaction to proceed, did not increase its capital, (iii) entered into
debt assumption agreements in return for the transfer of shares but never met its
obligations to Union Banka and Union Group under those debts, (iv) defaulted on
its obligation to pay for shares of minority shareholders in Union Banka, which
Czech law required it to offer to acquire and (v) is still a party to the Czech
Repudiation Claim proceedings in which it argues that the debt assumptions were
void ab initio as a matter of Czech law.

As a result, even if it could be established that Invesmart had legal to the shares
in Union banka and Union Group (which is denied for the reasons detailed above),
the Claimant never became the beneficial owner of the shares in question because it
never performed the obligations which were the quid pro quo of its acquisition of
those shares, Accordingly, Invesmart cannot be said to have invested any assets in
the Czech Republic as required under Article 1(a) of the BIT. Therefore, Invesmart
made no investment protected by the BIT.”

 

In its subsequent Statement of Rejoinder, and at the hearing, the Respondent appeared to
retreat from its first contention, that the Claimant did not become the owner of the shares, and
emphasised the second aspect of its argument, namely that there had been no investment of
capital. As far as ownership of the shares in concerned, the decisions of the Czech courts,
which are referred to below, would appear to establish, or at least are consistent with, the

186.

proposition that the Claimant did in fact become the legal owner of the shares in Union Banka

and Union Group.

The second aspect of the Respondent's argument focuses on the substance of the investment.
The Respondent refers to the preamble to the BIT which states that the Treaty’s object is to
"stimulate the flow of capital and technology and the economic development of the

Ci ing Parties". The R di intains that merely iring legal title over any kind

 

of asset is not sufficient to bring that asset under the protection of the BIT. The Respondent
contends that there must be a commitment of money to earn a financial return. The Respondent
states that the Claimant has not paid for the shares and that throughout the lifetime of its
activities in the Czech Republic, the Claimant has outlayed no expenditure for the benefit of
Union Banka. Indeed the Claimant has instead been reimbursed for its due diligence work and

for the living expenses of its representatives operating in the Czech Republic.

In support of its argument the Respondent refers to a number of cases including Salini
Costruttori S.p.A and Italstrade S.p.A v Kingdom of Morocco; 10 Joy Mining Machinery
Limited v Arab Republic of Egypt ,''' amongst others.

The Claimant contends that the cases cited by the Respondent are ICSID cases that examine
the meaning of the term "investment" in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, which was
purposely left undefined by the drafters. However, the Claimant argues that the definition of
investment for the purposes of the BIT is defined and is exclusive.

Article 1(a) of the BIT defines "investments" as follows:

(a) the term ‘investments’ shall comprise every kind of asset invested either
directly or through an investor of a third State and more particularly,
though not exclusively:

i. movable and immovable property and all related property rights;

ii, shares, bonds and other kinds of interests in companies and joint
ventures, as well as rights derived therefrom;

iii. title to money and other assets and to any performance having an
economic value;

iv. rights in the field of intellectual property, also including technical
processes, goodwill and know-how;

vy. concessions conferred by law or under contract, including
concessions to prospect, explore, extract and win natural resources.

188.

189.

It will be seen that Article 1(a)ii expressly includes "shares" in the definition of "investments".
The Respondent's contention would require the Tribunal to read in a qualification that there be
payment or other consideration for the acquisition of the shares. Moreover it would seem to
follow that any consideration however small may not suffice. Would a nominal consideration
of say one cent or a peppercorn be any different, in substance, from no consideration? The
Respondent referred to the aim of the BIT, as set out in its preamble, which is to stimulate the
flow of capital and economic development. If the shares were acquired for a nominal value this
could hardly be regarded as sufficient to stimulate the flow of capital and economic
development.

It would seem, then, that the Respondent's submission, if accepted, would require the Tribunal
to embark on an inquiry as to whether the consideration paid for the shares was adequate or
perhaps substantial. Such an enquiry would necessitate the Tribunal undertaking an
assessment of the value of the investment and the consideration paid with no criteria to guide
it. Moreover even if the consideration paid was adjudged to be ‘adequate’, would there have to
be a further assessment as to whether the total amount invested was sufficiently substantial
having regard to the aim of the BIT to stimulate the flow of capital and economic
development?

The Respondent's submission would require the Tribunal to qualify the express words of
Article 1 by implying an additional requirement of a qualitatively adequate investment. The
Tribunal sees no compelling reason for doing so. The Tribunal considers that Article 1 should

be given its plain and literal meaning and that the express inclusion of "shares" as an

 

means that the isition of shares i anit without further
inquiry.

Preclusion

190.

The consideration which the Claimant agreed to provide for its acquisition of the shares was an
unconditional promise to pay EUR 90 million to discharge Union Banka's related party loans.
The Claimant never made the payment, contending that the whole arrangement was
conditional on the Czech Government providing aid to the bank. Subsequently Union Banka
were placed in liquidation and the t trustees d some 18

against the Claimant seeking payment of the EUR 90 million. The Claimant contended that the
share acquisition agreements, and in particular its obligation to pay the EUR 90 million, were
void or otherwise unenforceable. Three of these cases have been decided. In each, the Czech
courts decided that the share purchase agreements were valid and that Invesmart consequently
had an obligation to pay the EUR 90 million consideration.

41

191. The Respondent argues that the Claimant has adopted fundamentally inconsistent positions in
the Czech court proceedings and in this arbitration. In this arbitration the Claimant states that it
has made an investment in the Czech Republic and seeks relief against the Czech Government
with respect to its alleged breaches of obligations under the BIT concerning that investment.
However in the Czech court proceedings the Claimant contends that the debt assumptions, and
in turn the share acquisitions, were void with the logical consequence that there could never

have been an investment.

192. The share acquisition agreements were entered into between the Claimant and third persons
who are not parties to this arbitration. Neither party to this arbitration has asked this Tribunal
to determine whether the share acquisition agreements are valid and the Tribunal has not heard

argument as to whether it has jurisdiction to do so.

193. In the circumstances, the Tribunal assumes the validity of the share purchase agreements
unless and until it is established that another court or tribunal with authority has determined
that the share purchase agreements are void as a matter of Czech law. Moreover, the evidence
before this Tribunal is that in three decided cases, the Czech courts have held that the share
purchase agreements as well as the obligation of the Claimant to pay the consideration of EUR
90 million are valid and enforceable. Therefore, this Tribunal has no basis for considering the
agreements to be void. The Claimant is not precluded from contending that it made a valid
investment in the Czech Republic.

Applicable Law
194. Article 8(6) of the BIT provides:

The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in
particular though not exclusively:

° the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;
° the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant Agreements
between the Contracting Parties;
. the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;
. the general principles of international law.
195. The application of this provision was clarified by representatives of the Netherlands and the

Czech Republic who held consultations pursuant to Article 9 of the BIT. As a result of these
consultations, Agreed Minutes dated 1 July 2002 provided:

(i) On the issue of investment disputes and interpretation of Article 8.6 of the
Agreement [i.e., the Treaty]:

The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law. When making its
decision, the arbitral tribunal shall take into account, [in particular] though not
exclusively, each of the four sources of law set out in Article 8.6. The arbitral
tribunal must therefore take into account as far as they are relevant to the

42

196.

197.

198.

dispute the law in force of the contracting party concerned and the other
sources of law set out in Article 8.6. To the extent that there is a conflict
between national law and international law, the arbitral tribunal shall apply
international law.'!
The Claimant submits that in practice this means that the Tribunal must apply the substantive
legal provision set forth in the Treaty, the applicable international law instrument to the merits

of this dispute, along with any relevant general rules of international law.''?

According to the
Claimant Czech law plays two roles. First, the Treaty itself provides that Czech law is relevant
to the extent that it is more favourable to the investor then the Treaty. Secondly, it is a well-
established principle of international law that, before an international tribunal, the host state's
domestic law is relevant with respect to factual issues.!"*

The Respondent proposes that Czech law enforced during the events described in the
Statement of Claim must be applied to the extent relevant to this dispute and to the extent not
contrary to international law. According to the Respondent Article 3(5) certainly does not
mean that the law of the host state should be disregarded and limited only to cases where it
affords better treatment to the investor. There are good reasons why national law needs to be
examined before turning to international law. The Respondent further claims that whether the
existence of a "commitment" to provide state aid to the Claimant could have arisen in the

circumstances must be based upon or consistent with Czech law as in effect.''*

The Tribunal observes that the difference in the position of the Claimant and the Respondent is
more apparent then real. The Claimant concedes that a host state's domestic law is relevant
with respect to factum and refers to Oppenheim's International Law (9th Edition 1996 by Sir
Robert Jennings and Sir Arthur Watts). In the Tribunal's opinion, Czech law is relevant insofar
as it p' ibes the i for making an i and obtaining state aid. The

 

difference in result if Czech Law is applied as factum or as a governing law is immaterial
and to some extent academic. However, the Tribunal notes that Czech law is a governing law
under the treaty, although its application as a governing law is always subject to the
qualification that in the event of conflict between national law and international law,

intemational law prevails.

Fair and equitable treatment

General standard

199.

200.

201.

202.

203.

Chief amongst Invesmart's claims is its submission that the Czech Republic violated the fair
and equitable treatment standard which is set out at Article 3(1) of the BIT. This article
provides that "each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment to the

investments of investors of the other Contracting Party".

The Tribunal notes that there has been a growing jurisprudence and case law dealing with the
notion of fair and equitable treatment in recent years. The content of this obligation has been
variously and not consistently described as including the different strands of protection of an

investor's legitimate expectations, protection against manifestly arbitrary or grossly unfair

 

 

requiring i of g | decisi king, pi , due process
and adequate notice, protection against discrimination that does not amount to a breach of the

national treatment standard and protection against acts of bad faith.

The tribunal in Waste Management v Mexico sought to bring together various NAFTA awards

and to state the law in summary terms:

(Flair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and
harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or
idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial
prejudice, or involves lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends
judicial propriety... in applying the standard it is relevant that the treatment is in
breach of representations made by the host state which were reasonably relied on by
the Claimant. '"®

In its Statement of Defence the Respondent correctly noted that the two most fundamental
features of the fair and equitable treatment standard are:

(i) the fact that the violation of that standard occurs only when a certain
minimum level of inappropriateness of the host state’s conduct is
exceeded; and

(ii) that the dominant feature of that standard is the protection of the

investor's expectations which must, however, be legitimate and

reasonable and follow from the state of the domestic law at the time of

the investment and the totality of the business environment at the time.
In support of these observations the Respondent drew the Tribunal's attention to the Saluka
Partial Award where that tribunal endorsed and commended (“as a useful guide”) Waste
Management's threshold for infringement of the fair and equitable treatment standard when
interpreting the instant Treaty. Saluka went on to quote the comments of tribunals in the

"6 Exhibit C-193, Waste Management, Inc. v The United Mexican States (No.2), 1CSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3,
Award of 30 April 2004, para 98.

44

Tecmed, CME, Waste Management and the Occidental Petroleum cases as to the relationship
between the notion of “legitimate expectations” and the fair and equitable treatment standard,
and stated its view that:

304. This Tribunal would observe, however, that while it subscribes to the
general thrust of these and similar statements, it may be that, if the terms were taken
too literally, they would impose upon host States’ obligations which would be
inappropriate and unrealistic. Moreover, the scope of the Treaty’s protection of
foreign investment against unfair and unequitable treatment cannot exclusively be
determined by foreign investors’ subjective motivations and considerations. Their
expectations, in order for them to be protected, must rise to the level of legitimacy
and reasonableness in light of the circumstances.

305. No investor may reasonably expect that the circumstances prevailing at
the time the investment is made remain totally unchanged. In order to determine
whether frustration of the foreign investor’s expectations was justified and

le, the host State’s legiti right to regulate di
matters in the public interest must be taken into consideration as well. As the S.D.
Myers tribunal has stated, the determination of a breach of “fair and equitable
treatment” by the host State must be made in the light of the high measure of
deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic
authorities to regulate matters within their own borders.!””

Legitimate Expectations

The Claimant

204.

205.

The central plank of Invesmart's fair and equitable treatment claim was its contention that it
formed a legitimate expectation that the Respondent committed to provide state aid having a
certain financial effect upon Union Banka. This expectation was said to have crystallised on 24
October 2002 when, after extensive written and oral communications with various Czech
agencies, Invesmart’s third application to acquire control of the bank was approved by the
CNB.

Invesmart submitted that throughout its discussions with the Czech Government it stated that
its investment in the bank was contingent upon a grant of state aid and that its investment was
based on an express, or in the alternative an implied, commitment of state aid. The Czech
financial authorities were fully aware of its position as Invesmart had communicated this to
them. The express promise came from governmental officials and the implicit promise lay in
the CNB’s approval which, in the Claimant’s view, would not have been granted had the
Ministry of Finance not committed to provide state aid. Therefore, when the CNB approved
the acquisition of a controlling shareholding in the bank on 24 October 2002, a promise of
state aid enforceable at international law was said to have crystallised.

"7 See Exhibit C-194, Saluka Partial Award of 17 March 2006, paras 288, 304-305, italics in original.

45

206. Accordingly, Invesmart argued that the Tribunal should find in its favour if it finds that the
Czech Republic made an express representation that state aid would be granted, or,
alternatively, if the Czech Republic induced Invesmart to acquire the bank and assume the
related party loans under circumstances where Invesmart held a legitimate expectation of state
aid, 118

207. The Claimant adduced several categories of evidence in support of its characterisation of the

CNB's approval of its acquisition, including:

(a) ‘written communications between Invesmart, the CNB and the MOF which
Invesmart offered as proof that it had stated that its acquisition of Union Banka
‘was subject to state aid being granted;

(b) internal government documents which Invesmart offered as proof of the CNB's
understanding that Invesmart would not invest in Union Banka absent state aid;
and

(c) communications surrounding internal government meetings held on 24 September

2002 and 24 October 2002, which Invesmart claimed were pivotal points in its

negotiations concerning Union Banka.

208. In developing its submissions it went on to characterise the state aid negotiations following the

CNB's approval as changing the rules of engagement once the acquisition had been made.

209. The specific items of evidence adduced by Invesmart in support of its submissions are
described in more detail in the paragraphs directly below.

Correspondence between Invesmart and the CNB and MOF

210. The Claimant referred to five examples of written communications with the CNB and the
Ministry of Finance where it stated that it would acquire contro! of Union Banka only if state
aid were granted. For example, the minutes of a meeting held on 5 December 2001 between
the CNB and Union Banka, just after Invesmart became involved with the bank, noted the
contemplated sale of shares in Union Group to Invesmart and recorded that the sale was
subject to conditions such as CNB approval and “resolving the Fores (Ceska finanéni

project)" ("CF Transaction").'"?

Union banka, and Union Group.

 

 

211. Likewise, by letter dated 26 March 2002 to Pavel Racocha and Vladimir Krejéa of the CNB,
copied to Marie Parmova (then President of Union Banka), Invesmart’s Giuseppe Roselli
stated the company’s intention to purchase 70 percent of Union Group’s shares. Mr Roselli’s
letter recorded Invesmart’s position on the need for the CF Transaction:

In [sic] the same time we are preparing, in cooperation with our advisors, the
reconstructing plans for both Union Group and Union banka. We want to finalise
the whole transaction in the shortest time, as soon as your approval will be granted,
therefore we would appreciate any support for the conclusion of the “Fores-Ceské
Finanéni” deal, which constitutes condition precedent for the contract’s completion
[sic].

212. Three letters to similar effect followed during the course of the spring and summer of 2002.'7!

213. The Claimant noted that the CNB itself believed that given Union Banka’s poor condition, if.
state aid were not granted, Invesmart would not invest in it. For example, a report prepared by
the CNB’s Banking Supervision Division, dated 5 September 2002, noted:

Even though Invesmart B.V. has in no written material ever stated entirely
unambiguously that if aid is not provided to Union Banka, a.s. it will have no
interest at all in acquiring it, it is highly likely, given the bank’s situation, that state
aid is absolutely essential for the profitability of the whole operation from the point
of view of the applicant, and thus also for its decision whether to enter Union
Banka, a.s.'??

214. The Claimant also highlighted a draft unsigned letter that was annexed to the record of the
CNB’s 5 September 2002 meeting from Governor Tima to Finance Minister Sobotka.
Invesmart argued that the Government “induced” it to acquire the bank through the promise of
state aid, citing the draft letter in support of its contention. The draft letter stated:

«+. it appears that before making a definitive decision on the issue of financing its
purchase of a stake in Union Banka, invesmart B.V. is waiting to find out the
Finance Ministry’s opinion on the proposal for dealing with the ‘Fores problem’
that the bank has put forward. The Finance Ministry’s decision on this issue is thus
likely to have significant consequences for the situation in Union Banka, a.s, The
Czech National Bank believes it is unacceptable for the uncertainty concerning the
bank’s future to be further prolonged for an unlimited time, and so it would
welcome if steps’ could be taken that would induce the applicant to make a decisive
statement.'? [Emphasis added.]

Meeting of 24 September 2002

215.

216.

217.

219.

Invesmart also relied upon two meetings held in the autumn of 2002. The first, held on 24
September 2002, involved the CNB, CKA and Finance Ministry officials, including the newly
appointed Finance Minister Bohuslav Sobotka. The troubled state of Union Banka and
Invesmart’s possible equity participation in the bank was discussed at this meeting.

Under the heading “Conclusions”, the minutes recorded that the loss from the credit agreement
between CF and Union Banka should be covered by the National Property Fund in conformity
with the 1996 government stabilisation fund, and in case of a change to the agreement, the
Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (OPC) “will need to be consulted and
government approval will be required". There was also a discussion of the form of state aid,
namely, a reduction of the interest rate for the CF deposit in Union Banka from 11.5 percent to
approximately 3.5 percent and the purchase of bad quality loans “according to selection by

CKA against a decrease of the Ceska Finanéni deposits". '"*

The Claimant placed particular emphasis on the recording in the minutes that “the minister of
finance is ready to submit a document for the state aid defined in this way for the government
session".!"> The Claimant submits that this demonstrated that the amount and structure of state
aid had been agreed; that, as matters stood, the consent of the OPC was not needed for its
granting; and that the Minister undertook as of 24 September 2002 to submit the initiative to

the government for its approval.”

The minutes proceeded to set out the next steps to be taken. These were that the Ministry of
Finance and the CKA “will discuss the state aid with Invesmart by 25 October 2002 at the
latest", the CNB “will notify Invesmart on necessity of submitting the documents” to obtain
CNB approval, and the Ministry of Finance and the CKA “will discuss the form of the state aid
with OPC as settlement of the stabilization programme following return of OPC

representatives from Brussels by 1 October 2002 at the latest".'?7

communicated to it the next day.'* This was acknowledged by the CKA’s Mr. Pavel Rezabek
in his second witness statement.'””

Following the 24 September 2002 meeting, there were a number of communications on the
Invesmart proposal between senior Czech officials. These documents were disclosed to the
Claimant in response to its request for production of documents. For example, by letter dated 7
October 2002, Minister Sobotka wrote to the CNB Governor adverting to Invesmart’s earlier
proposal and noting that the conditions of the entry of the investor to the bank had since been
“mutually defined". He referred to the CF matter and noted that on 25 September 2002, a
meeting was held at the office of the First Deputy Minister of Finance’s office at which
representatives of Invesmart gave a binding promise to provide the documents that had been
missing in Invesmart’s first application for acquisition of control of Union Banka.'*°

A reply to Minister Sobotka’s letter, dated 11 October 2002, was sent by Oldiich Dédek of the
CNB. Referring to the CNB’s rejection on 4 October 2002 of Invesmart’s second application
to acquire the bank due to the missing documents, Mr Dédek noted that while Invesmart had
stated that it would supply the requested documents and it had also confirmed that its entry
into the bank was “still subject to the state aid in resolving the problem of the receivable of
Ceské Finanéni, s.r.0. due from this bank". Mr. Dédek continued: “Given the above, we may
state that, if the state aid is refused, Invesmart B.V. will most probably cease its effort to enter
into Union banka, a.s.” He thus requested the Ministry of Finance to communicate “its clear
standpoint to the representatives of Invesmart B.V.”?! The Claimant construed these letters as.
confirming its view that the CNB would not have later approved its share acquisition without
the Ministry of Finance’s having first agreed to provide state aid.

Meeting of 24 October 2002

222.

The second meeting upon which Invesmart relied took place on 24 October 2002, the same day
as the CNB approved Invesmart’s acquisition of indirect control of Union Banka. This was a
meeting of the CNB’s Bank Board which the Minister of Finance also attended. An excerpt of
the record of the meeting, produced by the Respondent in response to the Claimant’s request
for production of documents, recorded that Union Banka was discussed. The minutes, which
were in summary form, noted:

The Bank Board noted the oral details provided by Mr. Sobotka about the Czech
Finance Ministry’s point of view with regard to negotiations with the foreign

investor and the Banking Supervision Department’s approach to dealing with
Invesmart’s latest application for approval to its purchasing of a stake in Union
Group, a.s. and Union Banka, a.s.'**

223. The Claimant acknowledged that the minutes did not record what the Minister actually said at

the meeting, but contended that it could be inferred from the surrounding circumstances that he
must have stated his intention to obtain the required state aid package at that meeting.

 

224, Those ci: included: (i) lication had been exp! ly diti
throughout on that requirement; (ii) Invesmart’s third application for the CNB’s approval had
been submitted only two days previously; (iii) the CNB had been pressing the Ministry of
Finance for its “clear standpoint” on state aid; (iv) the bank’s situation was serious due to a run
on the bank after a CNB spokeswoman had commented on the rejection of Invesmart’s second
application on 22 October 2002; and (v) the fact that CNB’s approval of the third application
occurred after the Finance Minister made his comments to the Bank Board.'** The totality of
the circumstances, Invesmart argued, allow the Tribunal to infer that the Minister must have
stated his support for the requested state aid and Invesmart reasonably formed the expectation
that that was the case when its third application was approved only two days after it was
submitted to the CNB.'*

225. Invesmart observed further that the day after the CNB approved its acquisition, a meeting was
held between a Finance official, Josef DoruSka, and two Euro-Trend representatives and the
only form of state aid discussed there was the CF Transaction. The minutes record Mr DoruSka
asserting that “the only hope, in view of time pressure as well, is to proceed” with an

amendment to the loan contract with CF.'** This indicated, in Invesmart’s view, that the form

of state aid had been agreed.'°6

226. From the submissions made at the hearing, it appears that for the Claimant the significance of

the CNB’s approval was twofold. First, it was said to constitute a commitment by the

"22 Exhibit C-292, record of the 42" meeting of the CNB Bank Board held on 24 October 2002.

Governor Tima to Minister Sobotka, which referred back to the 24 October 2002 meeting and in recapitulating the
meeting stated that “[aJt this stage, the Ministry of Finance said that it was prepared to submit the proposal for State
aid to the Czech Government for discussion, with a view to resolving the situation at Union Banka, subject to
approval from the Czech Office for the Protection of Economic Competition.” The Claimant considered that the
Minister had been more emphatic at the 24 September 2002 meeting than he acknowledged at the hearing:

connection with the assumption of certain related-party loans.'” Invesmart pointed out that

with the selling shareholders, together with various addenda thereto.'*

Claimant's characterisation of negotiations following CNB approval

227. During the hearing, the Claimant developed the point that after the CNB’s approval was
granted, the Czech authorities changed the rules of engagement and began to impose new
conditions on the granting of state aid. This culminated in the denial of state aid to Invesmart,
contrary to its expectation. The Claimant argued that it was only after the CNB acted and
Invesmart had bound itself to acquire the shares in Union Banka and Union Group that these
conditions were brought to its attention. Invesmart argued that at this point the structure of
what was acceptable to the government changed and hurdles began to be raised that were
inconsistent with its expectation that the CNB’s prior approval of 24 October had resolved the
issue of state aid in its favour.

228. This argument relates both to the legitimate expectations claim and to the separate alleged
violation of Article 3, namely, the claimed inconsistent treatment of Invesmart’s investment by
the Czech ities. Insofar as the legiti Pp i is d, the

Claimant referred principally to two events.

229. First, it noted that unbeknownst to Invesmart, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Czech
Republic had represented to the European Union that the Republic would not grant any new
state aid to the banking sector.'%”

230. Secondly, Invesmart adverted to the meeting between the Ministry of Finance, CKA and
Invesmart representatives on 5 November 2002 at which the bank’s First Plan was reviewed
and Invesmart was informed of the internal discussions that had been held with the OPC. It
was advised that any aid had to be “targeted, limited and pre-approved by the OPC” and had to
be approved by the government. In addition, it was told that if the solution proposed in the
material presented was chosen, the material required further work.'”? Invesmart asserted that
this marked the beginning of a series of demands for more detail and shifting mechanisms of
delivering state aid, the effect of which was inconsistent with what it had been led to believe

would occur after the CNB approved its acquisition of indirect control of Union Banka and its
shareholders authorised the capital increase. The Claimant emphasised that the 5 November
2002 meeting occurred the day after Invesmart’s shareholders had ratified their 16 October
2002 decision to increase the company’s share capital by €90 million, i.e., after one of the
conditions precedent for the completion of the SPAs with the selling shareholders was

removed.'*!

By way of example, Invesmart pointed to the discussion at the 5 November 2002 meeting
where the CKA’s Mr ReZabek raised the possibility of whether the CNB (not represented at
the meeting) could ise the BDS Arbitration Claim as a ism for providing state

 

aid, Mr Rezabek suggested that this possibility offered a “purely commercial solution” that
would bail out the bank but not require the competition authorities’ approval. '” This proposal
was rejected by the CNB on 8 November 2002. The Claimant saw this as a troubling sign of
inconsistent treatment (a point to which the Tribunal will return below).

With the BDS Receivable suggestion off the table, the discussions reverted to variations on the
CF transaction and another possibility, which was to issue a state guarantee for the repayment
ofa selected group of debts. These were examined at another meeting between the Ministry of
Finance, the OPC, the CNB, the CKA, Union Banka, Euro-Trend and Invesmart held on 29
November 2002. The meeting “aimed to achieve consensus” on how the Finance Ministry and
Invesmart should proceed in relation to the OPC. The minutes noted that a decision from the
OPC was a necessary condition for the government’s final decision on the granting of state

aid.'*

The competition authorities also advised at this meeting that the request and its accompanying
material, particularly the restructuring plan, would have to fully respect the EC’s Guidelines on
State Aid for Rescuing and Restructuring Firms in Difficulty. It would also have to be shown
why the bank could not survive in the market without state aid and the reasons why its
existence should be preserved, “in other words, that state aid was essential (including why the
shareholders or other parties could not rescue the bank themselves)".' The Claimant also
asserted that the-record showed that the Minister of Finance’s requests for state aid regularly
succeeded in being approved by Cabinet.'** This confirmed, in Invesmart’s view, the
reasonableness of its expectation that once the 24 September 2002 meeting’s results had been

communicated to it, with the CNB then having approved its acquisition of indirect control of

Amount of state aid

234,

235.

236.

The disputing parties disagreed as to whether the amount of state aid discussed between
August and September 2002 was CZK 650 million in total, or a (larger) grant of state aid that
conferred a net benefit of CZK 650 million on the bank. In this regard, Invesmart observed that
although the CZK 650 million figure was discussed, from the outset, the Czech authorities
understood that the cost to the State would be greater than that sum and that any risk associated
with the quality of the CF loan portfolio was clearly to be borne by the government." It
pointed to a memorandum dated 10 September 2002 prepared by the Czech Consolidation
Agency for Finance Minister Sobotka, which set out the CKA’s position on the proposed
settlement of relations between CF and Union Banka presented by Invesmart in August 2002.
The memorandum noted that the reduction in the interest rate on the Fores deposit would
create a retroactive loss to CF of approximately CZK 207 million and a future interest loss of
approximately CZK 251. As for the assumption of problem receivables, this would result in a

loss of approximately CZK 330-771 million.'*”

At the upper end of the estimate, the state aid
would cost the government more than CZK 1 billion. Invesmart pointed to this as proof that
the parties had previously distinguished between the net impact of the grant of state aid on

Union Banka and the cost to the government of providing such aid.

The Claimant stressed its view that notwithstanding the Respondent’s position in this

arbitration, in September-October 2002 the parties were in agreement as to the effect of the

    

Transactio:

million.'*

As noted in the Facts, on 20 February 2003, the Minister of Finance decided against
recommending state aid for Union Banka. The bank closed its doors the next day and an
administrative proceeding for the revocation of its licence was immediately initiated by the
CNB. The Tribunal will address these events in its discussion of the expropriation claim. For
present purposes, it is not necessary to enter into a discussion of the reasons for the denial of

state aid because the consideration of the legitimate expectations claim simply requires the

Tribunal to proceed on the basis that the expectation said to have crystallised on 24 October

2002 was not met.

The Respondent

237.

238.

239.

240.

241.

The Respondent argued that neither the factual record nor the governing law supported the

legitimate expectations claim.

It began by asserting that as a matter of Czech law and European Union (EU) law, there was

 

no right to state aid; indeed, state aid is forbidden unless its granting is permitted by the
relevant competition authorities. Noting that Article 8(6) of the BIT specifies that the Tribunal
must decide “on the basis of the law, taking into account in particular though not exclusively”,
inter alia, “the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned” and “the provisions of ...
other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties”, the Respondent asserted that
under both its own domestic law and under the various agreements to which The Netherlands
and the Czech Republic were party at the time, including the treaty of accession governing the
Czech Republic’s admission to the EU, there were prohibitions on the granting of state aid in
2002. Therefore, there could be no legally enforceable right to the grant of state aid.'”

Given that the law of the host state did not confer a general right to state aid, but rather
prohibited aid unless an exemption was granted, the Respondent argued that there could be no
legitimate expectation which is contrary to the law of the host state:

No investor, can hold, at least not legitimately and not in the absence of the clearest
possible commitment made by the state concerned, an expectation which the law of
the host state contradicts.'*°

On a related point, the Respondent challenged the Claimant’s general approach to the

governing law in this proceeding which, in the Respondent’s view, had avoided dealing in

particular with the Czech law aspects of the case. In the Respondent’s view, the Czech law was

extremely important in terms of the governing law.'*'

The Respondent also took issue with the Claimant’s characterisation of the acts of various
Czech entities as constituting a promise or commitment of state aid. In its submission, there
must be a concrete, specific promise in writing and there was no such document on the
record,'*? With no explicit promise in writing unequivocally promising state aid to Union
Banka, the Respondent argued that there could also be no expectation of state aid based upon

'2 Transcript, Day 1, Crawford, p. 126, lines 15-18.

54

an implied or constructive promise.'*

In its view, the Claimant was calling upon the Tribunal
to construct a promise out of the materials before it. This was not possible because the granting
of aid was a voluntary matter and could only be enforced as a legitimate expectation if the
State made an actual promise to deliver the aid. One would fully expect in a matter as
important as this that the representation sought to be enforced would be in writing and be

unequivocal.

242, Insofar as the Claimant sought to tie the CNB’s approval of Invesmart’s application for
approval of its acquisition of control of Union Banka to a commitment of state aid by the
Ministry of Finance, the Respondent argued that the CNB’s approval was simply an approval
of a shareholding interest, a “prior approval” in a multi-stage acquisition process and nothing
more.'5 One of the Respondent’s Czech law experts, Dr Petr Kotab, had opined that under
Czech law, the CNB’s approval is designed to prevent the entry into the banking sector of
persons whose activities may be detrimental to the system’s stability." This supported the
Respondent’s view that what the CNB did on 24 October 2002 was no more than a prior
approval. The Respondent is, and was at the time, a party to the Convention on Laundering,
Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime which requires it to ensure that
funds invested in its financial institutions were bona fide.'"’ The CNB had to satisfy itself that
Invesmart’s funds met this requirement. Beyond that, the CNB’s approval was a necessary step
in Invesmart’s acquisition of indirect control of the bank, but the approval did not oblige
Invesmart to complete that acquisition. Therefore, when the CNB issued its approval on 24
October 2002, that act could not reasonably be viewed to be a commitment to grant state aid
by another state entity vested with that power, i.e., the Ministry of Finance.'*

243. The Respondent argued further that there was a fundamental distinction to be drawn between a
binding promise and a legiti ion. In its closing ission, the dent argued
that a binding promise occurred when it could be clearly established that the state made a
commitment of a particular kind, which was sufficiently specific that the investor could rely on

it. A legitimate expectation was, on the other hand, “a modality of fair and equitable

57 Exhibit R-127, Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime of 8
November 1990, to which the Respondent acceded on 1 March 1997. The Respondent pointed out that under
Section 20(a) of the Banking Act, it was expressly prohibited from granting approval for the acquisition of a
participation in a Czech bank unless compliance with the Convention was assured. Thus, Section 9(3)(c) of Decree
of the CNB No. 16/2002 Coll., dated 8 April 2002 (Exhibit R-307), required an applicant to submit “evidence
regarding the origin of funds of the applicant, which will be used in the purchase of the shares in a bank or with the
use of which a participation in a person through which an indirect participation in a bank was acquired.”

treatment", not to be equated with anything analogous to a contract. Even assuming arguendo
that, on the facts of this case, the Respondent had given the Claimant an expectation of aid in
the amount sought in the Third Restructuring Plan, CZK 1.762 billion, the state could give an
investor an expectation of a certain treatment but in the end, that still did not mean that in
failing to accord such treatment, the state had breached the fair and equitable treatment
standard. Situations can change and an expectation is not a guarantee; nor is it an estoppel by a

government that it could not act in light of changed circumstances.'*

As for the terms of the alleged promise the Claimant sought to enforce, the Respondent argued
that there cannot be a commitment without the content being sufficiently agreed. Even if there
could have been a legitimate expectation of aid, it had to be a precise expectation and in the
Respondent’s view, the content and conditions of the alleged commitment changed materially
after the date on which the expectation was said to have crystallised.'® The Respondent took
issue with the Claimant’s argument that the amount of state aid was agreed as of that date. It
also challenged the suggestion made at the hearing that the objective of the exercise had been
to retum Union Banka to a capital adequacy ratio (“CAR”) of 14 percent. In the Respondent’s
view, there was nothing in the record evidence that made any reference to achieving that
capital adequacy ratio.'*' The Respondent suggested that the reason why the Claimant had
advanced the 14 percent CAR result was that nothing else would have sufficed. The evidence
showed that as the new management of Union Banka familiarised themselves with the bank’s

finances, they discovered that the problems were greater than they had thought.'®

The Respondent also took issue with the Claimant’s contention that the amount and form of
state aid had been agreed by 24 October 2002. In its view, the evidence showed that the
amount and conditions for the granting of the state aid at issue changed over time and
materially so after the CNB’s grant of approval which had allegedly crystallised the
commitment. Pointing to the Third Restructuring Plan, submitted to the Ministry of Finance on
12 February 2003, the Respondent noted that the amount of aid then being sought was
considerably higher than what had been sought by Invesmart in its initial 20 August 2002 letter

to the Ministry of Finance.'®

The Respondent also disputed a number of the factual elements of the Claimant’s case. It

pointed to contemporaneous documents which showed that Invesmart was aware of the need

for the OPC's approval months before it filed its third application with the CNB.’ It asserted
that, contrary to its pleading in this proceeding, Invesmart did not make its investment
contingent upon the CNB’s approval and the implicit approval of state aid now claimed to be
bound up in that approval. In this regard, the Respondent reviewed the documents amending
the Share Purchase Agreements and argued that Invesmart had become an obligor with
liabilities under the amended Share Purchase Agreements in mid-August 2002 (six weeks
before Invesmart’s second application was rejected by the CNB and over two months before
its third application was approved) and hence, contrary to Invesmart’s plea in this proceeding,
it did not condition its acquisition of li
of Union Banka upon the granting of state aid.'®

 

in ion with its ing indirect control

The Respondent also noted that the legitimate expectation claim had to be evaluated having
regard to the state’s “margin of appreciation” recognised by international law. This margin is
particularly wide, it was argued, when it comes to state aid and there was no case where a
breach of fair and equitable treatment had been found as a result of a regular exercise of

inherently discretionary governmental powers such as a refusal of state aid.'

Finally, insofar as the Basel Committee’s Guidelines had been relied upon in support of the

claim, the Resp did not see such as being relevant to
determining a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. The Guidelines addressed
“best practices” and were by their own terms non-binding. They could not be equated with an

international legal obligation, breach of which gave rise to a breach of Article 3 of the Treaty.
167

The Tribunal’s analysis - General Approach

249,

250.

In the Tribunal’s view, six propositions are relevant to its consideration of this claim.

First, although an investor’s expectation is subjective, i.e., what the investor believed to be the
import of its dealings with government officials on which it claims to have relied, for the
Tribunal, the test of whether such an expectation can give rise to a successful claim at
international law is an objective one. It is not enough that a claimant have sincerely held an
expectation; the expectation must be reasonable and the Tribunal must make the determination
of! bl in all of the ci If the tion was ible (for

255.

example, ill-informed or overly optimistic), it matters not that the investor held it and it will

not form the basis for a successful claim.

Secondly, a source of contemporaneous evidence of the investor’s expectation can be the
contractual documents by which it acquired its investment or otherwise dealt with the seller of

the investment where it purchased an existing investment.

Thirdly, there is a temporal dimension to evaluating a claimed expectation. To the extent that
the expectation is based upon the investor’s reliance upon the acts and/or statements of the
responsible government officials, it must be based on how the officials actually dealt with the

investor at the time.

For example, in the Tribunal’s view, it is not appropriate to base a claimed expectation upon
the content of internal governmental discussions to which the investor was not privy at the
time. If the contents of a particular governmental discussion or deliberative process to which
the investor was not a party were nevertheless disclosed to it, they can contribute to the
investor’s expectation. However, if it was not privy to a discussion nor informed of its results,
the investor cannot use documents disclosed in a subsequent arbitration as proof of its
expectation at the time. Such documents can confirm a claimed expectation, but they cannot be
used to establish a particular factual element of a claimed expectation if such element was

unknown to the investor at the time.'“*

Fourthly, the due diligence performed when the investor made its investment plays an
important role in evaluating its expectation. A putative investor, especially one making an
investment in a highly regulated sector such as financial services, as in the instant case, has the
burden of performing its own due diligence in vetting the investment within the context of the
operative legal regime. :

Fifthly, and related to the fourth point, an investor’s expectations must be based on the legal
regulatory regime in place in the host state. Although there has been a suggestion in some
cases that the investor’s subjective expectations are to be given substantial weight, they are not
to be the definitive source of the host state’s obligations. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees
with the point made in Saluka that:

The scope of the treaty’s protection of foreign investment against unfair and

inequitable treatment cannot exclusively be determined by the foreign investor’s
ibjective motivations and ions. Their expectations in order to be

 

 

188 For example, prior to this proceeding, Invesmart had no knowledge of Minister Sobotka’s attendance at a
meeting held on 24 October 2002 of the Bank Board of the CNB (Transcript, Day 7, Bernardini-Smith, p. 15, lines
4-16). This evidence could only be used to confirm an expectation then held by Invesmart.

38

256.

257.

258.

must rise to the level of legitimacy and reasonableness in light of the
circumstances.'®

As noted in the decision of the ad hoc Annulment Committee in MTD v Republic of Chile:

«+. The obligations of the host State towards foreign investors derive from the terms
of the applicable investment treaty and not from any set of expectations investors
may have or claim to have. A tribunal which sought to generate from those
expectations a set of rights different from those contained in or enforceable under
the BIT might well exceed its powers, and if the difference were material might do
so manifestly.'”
The Tribunal agrees with that statement and observes that when ascertaining the Respondent’s
obligations under the Treaty, the Tribunal must have regard to the governing law which, in the
instant case, includes the law of the host state and other relevant international agreements to
which the Contracting States are party. It is the Treaty which guides the Tribunal in
determining whether an investor’s subjective expectation is legitimate.

Sixthly, it is important to distinguish between the various entities of the state. While the acts of
governmental entities are attributable to the state for the purposes of international
responsibility, the fact of attribution cannot be used to obscure the allocation of different
competencies between different entities of the state when the issue of breach is determined.
The investor deals with the state in its various emanations. Barring some kind of agency
relationship, one entity of the state not vested with actual decision-making authority cannot be
taken to bind the entity which by law possesses the actual authority. In the instant case, to the
investor’s knowledge, there was a division of jurisdiction, powers and responsibilities between
the Ministry of Finance, the CKA, the OPC and the Czech National Bank, a point to which the
Tribunal will revert below.

Detailed analysis

259.

As noted above, Invesmart’s case is that it received an express, or in the alternative, an implicit
commitment of state aid from the Respondent. With respect to the latter, Invesmart claims that
it held a legitimate expectation that given its repeated prior statements that state aid was an
essential condition of its investment and its understanding of what the intemal thinking of the
Czech financial authorities was (or must have been), the CNB could only have given its
approval on 24 October 2002 on the basis of a prior commitment by the Ministry of Finance to
provide the requisite state aid. Invesmart claims that it was reasonable on its part to have then
ratified its earlier approval of the capital increase and to assume the related party loans.

Before proceeding with its detailed analysis of the claim, the Tribunal finds it helpful to
summarise certain points elicited from because his testimony had the effect, in
the Tribunal’s view, of narrowing the legitimate expectations claim from the way in which it
was advanced in the written pleadings. The Tribunal was struck by three points elicited from

on: (i) whether an express promise of aid was made to Invesmart; (ii) what the
CNB’s role in the events at issue was; and (iii) the Claimant’s awareness of the potential role
of the OPC.

admitted that Invesmart received no written promise of state aid from the
Respondent.’” In terms of an oral promise, : \ was, in the Tribunal’s view, vague
about who made such a promise. He testified that “several people within the Czech
Government” made such a promise.! But when asked to name someone who did so, he
responded “there was — the information we were given by the Minister of Finance”!”? and
when asked whether he was referring to Minister Sobotka, he responded:

Yes. Not directly; from his office. We also consider — and I didn’t have the chance
to finish what I was saying, but we also consider that the approval from the Czech
National Bank to our acquisition of Union banka was implicitly a binding promise
or commitment of state aid.”

He testified further that:

Someone promised me, or we understood a commitment was to help Union banka
to increase its value of 650 million.’
This testimony is not sufficiently cogent and precise to support the claimed express promise of
state aid. The witness could reasonably be expected to have a precise recollection of
specifically who in the government promised state aid because that is such a material fact for
this limb of the Claimant’s case. The witness should have been able to specify names and the
circumstances in which such an important commitment was claimed to have been given. Yet

the testimony on this point was vague and tentative. This, combined with © 's
retreating to the CNB’s approval as an implicit promise of aid, leads the Tribunal to view the
legitimate expectations claim as being more properly founded upon an alleged implicit

promise of state aid.

That implicit promise was said to be bound up in the CNB’s approval on 24 October 2002.

jurisdictions, powers and responsibilities between the various state entities,

conceded that the CNB could not promise state aid because it was a banking regulator.'”°
When asked whether Governor Tima had ever stated that “we understand that by giving
permission we accept a commitment to pay state aid", ' responded, “No, no, he
never said that".!”” Insofar as the period prior to 24 October 2002 was concerned, when asked
whether there was any document from the CNB promising state aid if Invesmart obtained CNB
approval, testified, “No, I don’t remember specifically”!

This means, in the Tribunal’s view, that the CNB’s approval in itself cannot be taken to have
amounted to an implicit commitment because Invesmart understood that it had no role in the
decision whether to grant state aid. This in turn narrows the inquiry to the Claimant’s
contention that the CNB would only have approved its application if it had had a concrete
statement from the Minister of Finance that state aid was going to be granted. The Tribunal
will revert to this below.

As for the role of the OPC : acknowledged that when Invesmart was debriefed
about the 24 September 2002 inter-agency meeting, he was told that the advice of the OPC was
being sought “in order to get their advice on the viability as far as the EU issues were
concerned".'” He agreed that the OPC was the entity of the Czech Republic that was to decide
whether the reduction of the interest rate on the Fores deposit would constitute state aid.'®° He
also acknowledged that he was told by Union Banka’s consultants, Euro-Trend, on 25 October
2002 (one day after the CNB had approved Invesmart’s acquisition of indirect control of the
bank) of the commitment made in writing to the EU by Deputy Prime Minister Rychetsky that
the Respondent did not anticipate providing any further state aid to the Czech banking

sector.'*!

”s testimony that he was made aware of the OPC’s role as a result of the 24
September 2002 meeting, that it would determine whether lowering the Fores interest rate
constituted state aid, and that Euro-Trend was informed of the Rychetsky letter to the EU on
25 October 2002 — eleven days before Invesmart’s shareholders ratified their earlier approval
of the €90 million capital increase — is also relevant to the Tribunal’s consideration of the

legitimate expectation claim.

With these points in mind, the Tribunal now turns to what it considers to be the key issues

bearing on the claim.

The law on state aid

269.

270.

271.

There is no legal entitlement to state aid at international law. As an exercise of its sovereignty,
leaving aside any treaty obligations it may have, a State has the discretion to decide whether or
not to grant aid. On the facts of this case, there was nothing in Czech law which affirmatively
stated that state aid would be granted upon request and a properly advised investor would
understand that to be the case.

In fact, rather than obliging signatory states to grant aid, the member States of the EU have to
the contrary undertaken not to grant it within the common market. That is, they have agreed to
constrain their previously unfettered right to grant aid in order to achieve the goal of free
competition. As an aspiring member of the EU, the Czech Republic was one such state at the

material time in this case.

Under Article 8(6) of the BIT, the Tribunal must have regard both to Czech law and the
provisions of “other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties". The relevant EU
instruments and the Czech law implementing them fall within these categories. Under those
regimes (the national and the supranational, which were consistent with each other in 2002 as
the Czech Republic moved towards full accession to the Treaty of Rome), there could be no
prima facie legal right to the granting of state aid. To the contrary, Section 2 of the Law on
state aid affirms that aid is forbidden if the OPC does not authorise an exemption from the
prohibition.'**

Due diligence

272.

273.

One element relevant to judging a legitimate expectation claim is whether the investor could
have made itself aware of the regulatory issues that faced its investment. Some tribunals have
characterised this as an issue of transparency. International agreements that have contained
express transparency obligations have cast them in terms of a duty imposed on the state to
publish its laws and regulations so as to allow a private party to familiarise itself with them and

be able to conduct its business affairs accordingly.'**

Czech law and the relevant international agreements between the two Contracting States to the
Treaty were both readily discoverable by the Claimant in 2001-2002. The regulatory practice

of the Czech Republic in the area of state aid was becoming more stringent in view of its
impending accession to the Treaty of Rome. In the Tribunal’s view, this too was discoverable
to the Claimant. The expert evidence of Professor Claus-Dieter Ehlermann adduced by the
Respondent shows that the relevant law and guidelines were available to be consulted had

Invesmart decided to retain counsel on this matter.'**

Those materials posited relatively
stringent requirements for granting an exemption to the prohibition on state aid. Counsel
would have been able to examine publicly available information on the materials needed to
request state aid and the types of considerations applied by national and supranational agencies

when evaluating state aid proposals.

During the hearing, acknowledged that Invesmart did not retain legal counsel to
advise it on the competition law issues governing the grant of state aid.'®* The Tribunal found
this surprising because the evidence shows that Invesmart knew fairly early on that
competition law and the enforcement agency, the OPC, both had a role to play in the resolution
of the bank’s hoped-for state support.

Ina letter dated 28 June 2002, addressed to the then-Minister of Finance, Jiri Rusnok,
requesting him to “reconsider the possibility to realize the project of ‘Finalisation of the
Foresbank stabilisation program’”, recognised that the state aid being sought by
Invesmart could be refused on the objection of the competition authorities. He noted in this
regard that:

... We are also working on submission of another expert’s opinion for selected
ts’ portfolio and the Economic Competition Office standpoint so that the Office
will not prevent us from the realisation of our project.’ [Emphasis added.]

   

Beyond’ , noting the fact that Invesmart was seeking an expert’s opinion, there
is no record evidence of what that advice amounted to, In the Tribunal’s view,
letter shows an awareness as of 28 June 2002 that the OPC could block the aid.

In the Tribunal’s view, Invesmart should have sought legal advice on the EU and Czech law so
that it understood precisely what the requirements were for making out the case for the
granting of an exemption to the restrictions on granting state aid. Had it done so, it could have
determined for itself that the law imposed strict guidelines on what information would be
required to be submitted to the relevant authorities in order to maximise its chances of
obtaining the requested aid to be granted.

transaction on the table and it took it from there and that “my understanding, my shareholders’
understanding throughout the whole process, has been that it was in the primary interest of the
Czech Government and the Czech Republic to rescue and save Union Banka”.'** This does
not assist the Claimant because, while the Claimant did indeed receive positive signals from
the Respondent, the record shows that they were not all in that direction. There had been
attempts by the bank’s existing management to resolve the problem, but those had been

unsuccessful.

Indeed, when __. approached the newly-appointed Minister of Finance in July 2002
after the parliamentary elections there was no “existing transaction” on the table because
Minister Sobotka’s predecessor had rejected Invesmart’s approach in May 2002. This is what
had led to send his letter of 28 June 2002 to Minister Rusnok asking him to
reconsider. His reference in that letter to Invesmart’s seeking an expert opinion so that the
OPC would not block the project shows an understanding that state aid was not automatic even
if the Minister of Finance were inclined to recommend its granting. Likewise, after the
Ministry of Finance indicated that it was willing to look at the issue of state aid, as
16 September 2002 letter shows, Invesmart’s 12 September 2002 meeting with

the CNB was not entirely positive from the investor’s perspective. recorded the
CNB’s Mr Jifigek as stating that “he sees no or very little chances for the transaction to be
completed".!" The CNB’s reply to while not prejudging the outcome of the
state aid issue, emphasised the MOF’s and OPC’s roles in approving the aid and pointed out
that determining whether to grant aid was not the CNB’s responsibility. '°° The information

position, though not entirely unreasonable, did not show the prudence that
could be expected of an investor whose investment was being conditioned upon the

government’s financial support.

The Tribunal considers that Czech counsel would have been aware of the tightening of the
Czech rules on state aid and the increasing oversight of the EC. Not surprisingly, as the state
aid regime became more stringent for the Czech Republic, the onus upon a party seeking such

aid and indeed upon a state inclined to grant it became heavier. What might have passed
muster in the mid-1990s would not necessarily pass muster in 2002.

282. The failure to seek legal advice reflected an underlying feature of the case: that the entire
venture seemed to be driven by frequent requests for state aid bound up in”
undoubted enthusiasm and drive to secure ownership of a cleaned up bank which he could then
sell to an established Western European bank. While the Tribunal considers that

and de Sury brought financial acumen to the project, there appears to have been

relatively little substantive legal due diligence performed by Invesmart. This is also reflected
in Invesmart’s contractual dealings with the bank and the selling shareholders, a matter to
which the Tribunal now turns.

Invesmart’s contractual relations with Union Bauka and the selling shareholders

283. An important theme of the Claimant’s case was that at all material times, it informed various
government entities that it would not proceed with the investment unless the state provided aid
resulting in an uplift to the net asset value of the bank of some CZK 650 million.'*! There is
ample correspondence and records of meetings that demonstrates that this position was
communicated by Invesmart throughout the period leading up to 24 October 2002.

284, In the Tribunal’s view, however, there is something of a disjuncture between those statements
and the legal documents relating to Invesmart’s relationship with Union Banka and Union
Group, some of which show that Invesmart did not act consistently with its position as
articulated to the Czech Republic.

285. First, the Receivables Assignment Agreement was executed on 13 August 2002. At this point
in time, according to the Agreed Statement of Facts, Invesmart had been communicating its
interest in acquiring control of the bank for over eight months, Invesmart’s Gert H Rienmiiller
informed the CNB by letter dated 12 August 2002 that it had decided to “support” the bank
“without closing the purchase of the bank".'?

286. The text of the letter warrants reproducing because it shows that prior to even submitting its
first summary proposal for the resolution of the bank’s issues with Ceska Financni, Invesmart
assumed obligations in relation to the Ceska Financn{ loan portfolio. Mr Rienmiiller stated:

... with reference to your letter dated 25 July 2002 ... I would like to inform you
that in the above mentioned matter intense talks between the current shareholders
and the investor, Invesmart, B.V. regarding the financial statements for the year

'®! Transcript, Day 1, Smith, p. 23, lines 21-25, p. 24, lines 1-22; Transcript, Day 7, Miles p. 134, lines 5-8, p. 136,

2001 have taken place. The result of the talks is that without closing the purchase of
the bank Inves: has decided to support Union banka by a it of a guarantee in

Meantime, Invesmart was also acquainting itself with the Cesk4 Financni case.

Ceska financn{ and the MOF. The results of these contacts cannot be predicted at

this time. However, taking into account that Invesmart increased its purchase price

by CZK 300 million, it cannot be expected that it would assume additional
obligations against Ceska financni, which were represented by the seller in
negotiations as solved.'% [Emphasis added.]

287. Although Mr Rienmiiller’s letter referred to a CZK 300 million guarantee being issued by
Invesmart, that was only one aspect of the transaction. In the Receivables Assignment
Agreement, Invesmart and Union Banka recognised that the bank was attempting to sell the
loan portfolio to CF.'* Invesmart agreed to an irrevocable assumption and purchase of that

portfolio if it was not transferred to CF, subject to the proviso that Union Banka would only be

able to require such assumption if and after it had failed to, for any reason whatsoever, assign

the receivables to CF by 1 December 2002.'% In that event, Invesmart agreed to pay CZK 1.
billion for the portfolio and the CZK 300 million guarantee to which Mr Rienmiiller referred
was to secure that obligation. In the event that it failed to take over the loan portfolio, the

guarantee, valid until 15 December 2002, was enforceable by the bank after its having given

notice to Invesmart.'°

288. The Receivables Assignment Agreement appears to have had at least two effects.

289. First, as Mr Rienmiiller anticipated in his 12 August 2002 letter to the CNB, it permitted the
bank to secure the issuance of the auditor’s report for the year ending 31 December 2001.'9”
On 16 August 2002, Deloitte & Touche issued its audit report on the bank’s 2001 financial
statements. Without such an audit report, the evidence showed, the bank’s situation would
have been extremely tenuous.

ly, the i Assi! idently led to an di of the SPAs
because on 14 August 2002, the day after its execution, Invesmart entered into Addendum No
4 to the two SPAs. In the Tribunal’s view, the importance of these contractual developments is
this: Invesmart assumed the obligation to pay for the CF loan portfolio — a key element of the
state aid that it was seeking — 7 days before submitting its proposal on the settlement of the
bank’s relationship with CF to the MOF. That is, Invesmart’s first proposal to the MOF was
made on 20 August 2002, seven days after it executed the Receivables Assignment
Agreement,'®
In the Tribunal's view the Receivable Assignment Agreement and Addendum No 4 tend to
undermine the Claimant’s contention that it made its participation in Union Banka conditional
upon the grant of state aid. In mid-August 2002, it bound itself to having to deliver the
substantial part of what it later proposed the state should grant. Moreover, although Addendum
No 4 still reserved the power to approve the share purchase to Invesmart’s shareholders, its
conditions for completing the transaction did not reflect the position that Invesmart was
consistently articulating to different government agencies. When asked by the Chairman as to
whether Invesmart sought legal advice on the amendments to the SPAs, |
answered:
I believe it was not very much a legal issue at the time, it was very much contained

in a business decision at the time.

The Tribunal recognises that it is not privy to the negotiating history of the entire transaction
and it is loath to impose legal perfection on an evolving situation after the fact. However, it
considers that the Claimant exposed itself in a sense in the way in which it structured the
conditions for the acquisition of the shares and the assumption of the related-party loans and
when it assumed the CF oan portfolio.

If the grant of state aid was the sine qua non of Invesmart’s acquisition of control of Union
Banka, it might have been expected that it would have either: (i) completed its acquisition of
control of the bank only upon receipt of a written undertaking from the Minister of Finance
that the requested state aid would be provided; or (ii) to be even more certain, have completed
the acquisition simultaneously with the aid being granted. Invesmart did not follow either

course of action.

198 As noted in the Agreed Statement of Facts, at p. 8, on that date, “Invesmart submitted its state aid proposal to the
Ministry of Finance ... Invesmart proposed the following measures: (i) the early termination of the Fores Deposit;
(ii) the investment of the proceeds from the Fores Deposit in subordinated debt of Union banka; and (iii) CF’s
purchase of a CZK 1.6 billion portfolio of non-performing loans.”

frankly admitted that they had erred in not obtaining a written promise of state
aid, testifying that “stupidly enough, looking back, we didn’t ask for it". Invesmart’s failure

to relate its i for ing the ion, as icated to various Czech

 

agencies, to its contractual documents with the selling shareholders and the bank created
exposure in the event that state aid was not granted. Such exposure is precisely what has forced
the Claimant to argue that if there was no express promise of state aid, the CNB’s approval
constituted an implicit promise to grant it. It would have been more prudent for Invesmart to
have formally conditioned its obligation to assume the related-party loans upon the grant of
state aid rather than rely upon what it now contends was an implicit promise of aid bound up in
the CNB’s approval.

The Tribunal will discuss the last amendment to the SPAs, Addendum No 5, in the course of
its discussion of the events of October 2002 below.

The Claimant’s general awareness of the domestic competition law regime prior to 24
October 2002

296.

297.

298,

Consistent with its view as to the related roles of due diligence and the host State’s law and
relevant i i between the i Treaty’s C ing Parties, the
Tribunal now turns to consider the role of competition law and the competition authorities in
the events at issue. This is an important issue when considering the legitimate expectations
claim, because the regulatory approval structure for state aid provides the legal context in
which the various government entities and indeed Union Banka and Invesmart itself operated

at the time.

The Claimant’s legitimate expectations claim emphasised that it was only after Invesmart’s
application was approved by the CNB that the role of the OPC in approving any aid and what

it saw as increasingly onerous conditions for the aid’s granting became clear.”

The Tribunal has already noted at paragraphs 274-276 that Invesmart was aware by June 2002
that the OPC would have a role in approving state aid, By letter dated 25 June 2002 to the
Acting Secretary of CF, ? : noted that Invesmart was trying “to get a standpoint of
the Economic Competition Office". A letter dated three days later addressed to the then-
Minister of Finance explicitly recognised that the aid being sought could be prevented by the

competition authorities and for that reason Invesmart was “working on submission of another

expert’s opinion for selected assets’ portfolio and the Economic Competition Office standpoint
“so that the Office will not prevent us from the realisation of our project".

The minutes of the 24 September 2002 meeting at the Ministry of Finance, on which the
Claimant placed significant reliance, also show that the state aid issue and the need to consult
the competition authorities was part of the government’s intemal discussions. The testimony is
that the substance of this meeting was accurately and fully communicated to Invesmart the
next day and acknowledged that he was told that the advice of the OPC was
being sought “in order to get their advice on the viability as far as the European Union issues

were concerned".

The issue of “old” versus “new” aid

300.

301.

302.

303.

One issue that arose during the hearing concerned whether the OPC had to consent to a
resolution of the bank’s issues with CF. The Claimant contended that that was not seen as state
aid that required the OPC’s approval because it was settling a previous arrangement that dated
back to the mid-1990s.2% There was no new state aid being discussed, in its view, and the
statements of government officials seemed to show that they likewise held that view, at least
until after Invesmart decided to acquire the shares of Union Group.

In the Tribunal’s view, looked at on their own, the 24 September meeting’s minutes are not
clear on precisely what the Ministry of Finance believed the competition authorities’ role to be

in relation to the CF Transaction then being discussed,

Strictly speaking, the Ministry of Finance could not speak for the OPC. But on the basis that
Invesmart thought that significant progress was being made towards a grant of state aid, the
Tribunal will examine what was conveyed to Invesmart on the issue of state aid prior to its
increasing its share capital and approving the SPAs.

On the one hand, the 24 September 2002 meeting’s minutes record that “in case ... [there is a]
change to the agreement” the “Office for the Protection of Competition will need to be
consulted and government approval will be required". This, as the Claimant argued, suggests
that the then-contemplated form of state aid (i.e., reduction of the Fores deposit interest rate
and the purchase of bad loans at book value or something closely related to book value) did not
have to be approved by the OPC.

On the other hand, as the Respondent pointed out, the “next steps” identified by officials in the
same minutes record that the “Ministry of Finance and CKA will discuss the form of the state
aid with OPC as settlement of the stabilisation programme following return of OPC
representatives from Brussels by 1 October 2002 at the latest". This suggests that the
competition authorities had to be consulted on any deal that might constitute state aid and that
they might determine that the Finanénf interest rate and receivables deal did fall within their

mandate,

The minutes are ambiguous on the issue of whether the competition authorities had to approve
the CF deal sought by Union Banka and Invesmart. Since the substance of the discussions was
disclosed to Invesmart, it would have been told that the OPC had some role to play in the
approval of state aid (a point which was already known to it. However, the Tribunal cannot
infer one way or the other whether the description of the meeting accorded with the part of the
minutes that the Claimant emphasised or the part that the Respondent emphasised (or both).

Were this to be the only contemporaneous document that discussed the state aid issue, the
Tribunal would be unable to judge what was conveyed to Invesmart. Further light can be shed
on this issue, however, by two other contemporaneous documents showing that the

competition authorities would play a role in a decision to grant state aid of any kind.

The first document was generated after the 12 September 2002 meeting between Invesmart
representatives and the CNB. The meeting had evidently not gone well from Invesmart’s
perspective because of the CNB officials’ statements about Invesmart’s second application for
approval and what its rejection might mean for Union Banka’s licence. (As shall be seen (at

hs 543-546), a rep ive of certain shareholders in Invesmart attended the
meeting and evidently formed a less than positive view of the bank’s Prospects.) In a letter
dated 16 September 2002 sent after the meeting to the Governor of the CNB and four of his
colleagues, stated that the CNB’s Mr Jiri Jificek had informed them that if
enough information on the financial aspects of the acquisition was not received by 16
September 2002, he would start the process to deny authorisation of the acquisition by
Tnvesmart. also recorded Jiritek’s stating that in such a case he will also start the
proceeding to withdraw the banking licence to Union Banka". 7%

letter spurred a reply from the CNB dealing with among other issues the

process by which the requested state aid would be addressed. At point 3 of its letter, the CNB
recorded the fact that its representatives had informed Invesmart that:

206 Exhibit R-66, letter dated 16 September 2002 from , to Zden&k Tima, Pavel Racocha, Viadimir
Krejéa, Petr Jiriéek, and Renate Vernerova, p. 2.

3. As regards the CNB’s standpoint concerning the successful completion of the

ion to acquire a qualifying holding and the ibility of the Bank’s
receiving state assistance, the CNB stated that any such assistance is primarily a
matter for the Ministry of Finance, requires the approval of the Czech Government
and must have the support of the Office for the Protection of Economic
Competition, which is also assessing this matter in the context of the preparations
for the Czech Republic’s accession to the European Union, The CNB’s opinion on
the completion of the overall transaction was not expressed at the meeting.”
[Emphasis added.]

309. This passage is instructive because it expressly brought to” 3attention the
division of competencies between the CNB, Ministry of Finance and the OPC, the need for
Czech government approval above and beyond the Minister’s approval, the need for the
support of the competition authorities, and the fact that the proposal was “also” being assessed
within the context of the accession to the EU, the plain implication being that EU issues would
be taken into consideration. At the hearing, _ acknowledged that by this letter
Invesmart was told by the CNB, before it approved the share acquisition, what the
requirements for the granting of state aid were.””*

310. The second document, a letter from Minster Sobotka to Governor Tima, dated 7 October
2002, referred back to the meeting with Invesmart on 25 September 2002 at which the
government’s deliberations were disclosed to it. The Minister noted that:

On 25 September 2002 a meeting was held in the office of the First Deputy Minister
of Finance with the representatives of Invesmart B.V. (Mr. Roselli, Mr. Rienmiiller,
Mr. Braun) in the presence of CEO of the Czech Consolidation Agency. In the
context of the meeting, the representatives of Invesmart B.V. were informed of the
requirements of the Bank Supervision Department for completion of the documents
needed for grant of approval with entry of the investor to the bank with the deadline
of 4 October 2002. Mr. Roselli gave a binding promise to provide the missing
documents to the Bank Supervision Department in due course. At the same time the
representatives of Invesmart B.V. were informed of the planned meeting with the
Office for the Protection of Economic Competition in Brno with the aim to assess
the procedure and options for resolution of the investor’s requirement for settlement

of the problems of Union Banka a.s. with regard to public support.” [Emphasis
added.]
311. Any ambiguity in the 24 September 2002 minutes as to the state of thinking within the

Government and as to what was communicated to Invesmart is thus resolved by a clear
statement in writing sent to Invesmart just before the 25 September meeting and corroborated.
by the letter sent by the Finance Minister to the CNB Governor recapitulating what occurred in
the meeting held the preceding day.

In the Tribunal’s view, the role of the competition authorities in vetting any proposed state aid,
including a settlement of the bank’s relations with CF, was brought to the Claimant’s attention
before it submitted its third application on 22 October 2002.

The Czech Republic’s commitment to the European Union

The Claimant argued further that the Respondent did not advise it prior to its shareholders
approving the capital increase on 16 October 2002 that a statement had been made to the EC
that the Czech Republic did not expect any further provision of state aid to the banking
sector.”"° It also complained that it was not until a meeting held on 29 November 2002 that
Invesmart was advised that Union Banka needed to submit a Restructuring Plan in accordance

with the EU’s Guidelines on State Aid for Rescuing and Restructuring Firms in Difficulty2"!

In this regard, the Claimant pointed to a document which showed that at a meeting held on 16
May 2002 between the Ministry of Finance, the CNB, CF, and the Czech Consolidation
Commission, Invesmart’s potential acquisition of control of Union Banka was discussed by
officials and in light of the undertaking given to the EU and the participants’ view that there
was little reason to provide state aid to the bank, it was resolved that CNB would proceed with
the approval procedures but the “Ministry of Finance will inform the investor about the
infeasibility of provision of state aid".”'” [Emphasis added.] The Claimant argued that it was
not informed of this complicating factor until after it approved the capital increase.

The consideration of this complaint requires the Tribunal to first take note of the amendment to
the SPAs that was effected just before Invesmart’s shareholders approved the €90 million
capital increase at a meeting held on 16 October 2002. Addendum No 5, which cancelled its
predecessor, No 4, was concluded on 14 October 2002. The purchaser and the sellers agreed in
this addendum that Invesmart would assume the debts of the selling shareholders without
undue delay. The assumption of debts obligation was made conditional upon (i) the CNB’s
approval of Invesmart’s application to acquire control of the bank and its assumption of the
selling shareholders’ debts; and (ii) the approval of Invesmart’s shareholders.2!3

Two features of this addendum are salient. First, consistent with its predecessor’s removal of
Clause 3.3 from SPA B (the condition precedent relating to state aid), nothing in this
addendum expressly made the completion of the Share Purchase Agreements conditional upon

Finanéni, and the Czech Consolidation Commission.

the granting of state aid. Secondly, Invesmart nevertheless still had a right not to complete the
deal because its shareholders had to approve the transaction before it could bind the company.

The second point is relevant to the legitimate expectations argument because there is a
temporal issue relating to the Claimant’s decision to approve the SPAs. The Claimant argued
that it did not know about the Respondent’s commitment to the EC until after its shareholders
approved the capital increase.”"* This may be so, but it is not the end of the matter.

Due to Invesmart’s failure to properly convene the 16 October 2002 meeting at which its
shareholders approved the capital increase, that decision had to be put to another vote on 4
November 2002 whereupon the shareholders ratified their earlier decision.?"* It was at this
same meeting that the SPAs were approved.”"° Thus, the relevant time for determining
whether Invesmart irrevocably committed to its investment in the bank without knowledge of
the Czech Government’s undertaking to the EC is not 16 October, but 4 November 2002.

It is clear from the record that Invesmart was advised in the CNB’s letter of 19 September
2002 that the aid issue was being considered in “the context of the preparations for the Czech
Republic’s accession to the European Union".”"” To the extent that this failed to fully disclose
the Minister’s undertaking, the Tribunal notes that at a meeting held on 25 October 2002, ten
days before Invesmart’s shareholders approved the SP As, the company’s advisors, Euro-
Trend, were informed of the Rychecky letter to the EC that there would be no more public
subsidisation of the banks.”

Thus, although the Claimant correctly points out that this discussion occurred one day after the
CNB approved the isition, this i ion was dto 'S i
well before Invesmart held its second shareholders meeting on 4 November 2002 at which the

 

shareholders approved the Share Purchase Agreements.

The Tribunal also notes that with respect to the need to draw up a Restructuring Plan, it
appears from the record that that was explicitly discussed for the first time at a meeting held on
29 November 2002. The Claimant has sought to attribute responsibility for this to the
Respondent in the sense that this was “sprung” on Invesmart after it completed its acquisition
of its shareholding interests. The Tribunal notes however that at the 25 November meeting,

Union Banka’s new Director, Mr Radovan Vavra, provided a different explanation. The

minutes record him informing the meeting that:

... The UB’s director then explained why the former management has not made any
efforts for granting of state aid earlier and had not prepared a restructuring plan ~

the reason was that they had assumed that the bank would win the arbitration
against the CNB regarding the compensation of damages of CZK 1.9 billion.””?
{Emphasis added.]

Mr Vavra’s remark must have been directed to the management personnel who held senior

positions prior to his joining Union Banka in the autumn of 2002.

There is also record evidence that suggests that Invesmart had reason to appreciate that
competition law considerations pertaining to EU accession could thwart its request for state aid
for some months. As noted earlier, the inter-agency meeting which discussed the EU
commitment was held on 16 May 2002. Invesmart met with the then-Minister of Finance
shortly thereafter. The precise message conveyed to Invesmart when the Ministry of Finance
then refused to consider granting state aid is not on the record, although the fact of that
rejection is. wrote to the CNB’s Pavel Racocha by letter dated 20 May 2002
(four days after the inter-agency meeting was held), noting that:

... AS you probably already know our meeting with the Minister of Finance was not
particularly positive.

The Minister stressed that at this time they do not consider to conclude the
acquisition of Fores by Ceska Finanéni.

As I mentioned to you last Friday we consider that transaction a main condition for
completing our acquisition of 70 per cent of Union Group.

Nevertheless, considering the upcoming elections and the fact that Union Banka
application at Ceska Finanéni has not been formally rejected, we have decided to
follow up with our application with the Central Bank and to confirm our
commitment to the project...?2°
The Tribunal has already adverted to 28 June 2002 letter which recognised

that the OPC could block the transaction.

Thus, although there is no direct evidence of precisely what was communicated to Invesmart
by the Respondent after the inter-agency meeting of 16 May 2002, it can be inferred from .
. contemporaneous letters that Invesmart was informed of issues relating to

competition law as it affected the granting of state aid to Union Banka. There would have been

no reason for to advert to the OPC’s role had that not been brought to

Invesmart’s attention.

Finally, assuming arguendo that the Czech authorities did not inform Invesmart of the
undertaking to the EU in May 2002 and instead referred only to competition law issues
generally, the question is whether that undertaking was materially different from what

Invesmart knew or should have known was the situation under Czech and EU law.

Here the Tribunal is of the view that: (i) the Czech Republic’s accession to the Treaty of Rome
was well known; (ii) Invesmart knew from June 2002 that the OPC could, to use Mr
Catalfamo’s words, “prevent us from the realisation of our project”; (iii) Invesmart was
advised in mid-September 2002 that the state aid was being assessed “in the context of the
preparations for the Czech Republic’s accession to the European Union”; (iv) Invesmart’s
advisors were informed on 25 October 2002 of the Rychetsky letter; (v) reasonable due
diligence into the governing Czech and EU law would have confirmed that state aid is
prohibited unless an exemption is granted; and (vi) the Czech Republic’s undertaking was
communicated to Invesmart at the latest by 25 October 2002, prior to 4 November 2002 when
its shareholders approved the Share Purchase Agreements. The Claimant was in a position to
understand that state aid had to be justified because it would be scrutinised by both Czech and
EU competition authorities.

What did the Ministry of Finance commit to do?

328.

329.

330.

The Tribunal turns to the seminal issue, namely; what did the Minister of Finance agree to do
at the 24 September 2002 meeting? The parties disagree over the meaning and import of the 24

September 2002 meeting minutes’ statement that “the minister of finance is ready to submit a

 

document for the state aid defined in this way for the government session". The question is
whether a document which by its own words indicates a willingness to follow a process of
seeking approval of aid constituted a promise, to deliver that aid, enforceable under the Treaty.

The disagreement centres on whether the Minister undertook an obligation of result such that,
beginning with the debriefing on 25 September 2002 and crystallising on 24 October 2002, the
Claimant formed a legitimate expectation that state aid was approved (the Claimant’s view), or
whether the Minister undertook an obligation of process, i.e., that he would evaluate the bank’s
planned restructuring and if he formed the view that it had a reasonable prospect of success, he
would submit it to the Cabinet and the OPC for approval (the Respondent’s view),

In the Tribunal’s view, the weakness for the Claimant's case is that the evidence shows that as
of 24 October 2002, the form of state aid and the modalities of getting approvals from the
Ministry of Finance, the Cabinet and the OPC were not fully defined. Put simply, on 24
October 2002, the bail-out plan was a proposal from Invesmart dating back to 20 August 2002

75

332.

333.

334,

which lacked the kind of detail and definition that would be required to obtain regulatory
approval.

The Tribunal finds support for this finding in the following facts derived mainly from
contemporaneous documents prepared prior to and after 24 October 2002.

First, although the Claimant relied upon the inter-agency meeting of 24 September 2002 as
proof of the Minister’s commitment to deliver state aid in a particular form,”! the evidence
strongly suggests that the CNB did not consider that the Finance Minister had made such a
commitment at that meeting. Otherwise, there would have been no reason for the CNB’s Mr
Dédek to write to Minister Sobotka on 11 October 2002 to outline the CNB’s subsequent
discussions with Invesmart, noting that the investor had stated its intention to deliver all of the
missing documents (pertaining to the source of its funds for the acquisition of its shareholding
in the bank) very soon, and to “ask you, dear Minister, that the Ministry of Finance of the
Czech Republic ... [communicate] its clear standpoint to the representatives of Invesmart
B.V." Had the Ministry already promised to deliver state aid, a letter from the CNB
requesting him to communicate his clear standpoint on the aid issue would have been

unnecessary.

Secondly, the testimony of both Governor Tima and former Minister Sobotka was consistent
that up to 24 October 2002, including at the meeting of the CNB’s Bank Board that day, the
Ministry of Finance had indicated its willingness to proceed with the process of considering
state aid, but that no commitment to deliver state aid had been undertaken by the Ministry up
to and including that date.”

The minutes recording the Bank Board’s 24 October 2002 meeting are cryptic in that they
record the fact of that the Minister spoke but not what he said. Due to the seminal importance
of this issue, the Tribunal has examined the contemporaneous documents with care in order to
determine whether there is any document that corroborates the witnesses’ testimony on this
point. It notes that after the CNB approved Invesmart’s entry into Union Banka, the minutes of
the meeting of 5 November 2002 record the Ministry of Finance’s view that the CNB’s
approval of 24 October 2002 had been the MOF’s pre-condition for the resumption of
negotiations between the Ministry and Invesmart, The minutes record him as stating that:

The MOF'’s condition for negotiations to be reopened was an unambiguous position
of CNB on the approval of the investor Invesmart B.V. entry into Union banka, a.s.
This condition was fulfilled.” [Emphasis added.]

 

335. This record, from a document prepared two weeks after the Bank Board meeting but prepared
well before the instant dispute arose, is in the Tribunal’s view, corroboration of the two
Respondent witnesses’ testimony on this point. It is consistent with Governor Tima’s
testimony that prior to 24 October, a certain deadlock had arisen between the CNB and the
Finance Ministry: “On the one hand, the Finance Ministry wanted to know whether Invesmart
was acceptable for us, and once again we are back to the question that Invesmart was not a
substantial company and so on", He continued, “ ... on the other hand, we certainly would
prefer to know from the State whether they would have been willing to provide the state aid or
not". Somebody had to break the deadlock, he testified, “ ... so we said, ‘Okay, this investor is
acceptable for the Czech National Bank’, and then it was up to the Finance Ministry to
decide".2> The Tribunal also notes that there is no record of anyone representing Union Banka
or Invesmart taking issue with the Ministry of Finance’s characterisation of its “condition for
negotiations to be reopened".

336. Thirdly, roughly one week before the CNB issued its approval, on 16 October 2002, Union
Banka retained Euro-Trend to advise it on the state aid issue.” The letter of authorisation
specifically contemplated Euro-Trend’s conducting negotiations “aimed at the restructuring”
with “the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic, the Czech Consolidation Agency, Ceska
finanéni s.r.o. and other state institutions".*” Reference to the terms of the contract shows that
Union Banka’s objective was to negotiate “the restructuring of its balance sheet with the
participation of the Czech State", and Euro-Trend was to “perform ... all necessary
negotiations with all involved parties, in particular with the Czech Ministry of Finance, Ceska
konsolidaéni agentura, and Ceska finanén{ s.r.o. in order to successfully implement the
objective” just described?” [Emphasis added.] The Agreement further provided that Euro-

224 Exhibit R-461, minutes of the meeting held at the offices of the First Deputy Minister of Finance on 5 November
2002 between Finance officials and representatives of Euro-Trend, Union Banka and Invesmart. During the hearing,
former Minister Sobotka adhered to the position that throughout the September—October 2002 period, although
Invesmart had a proposal on the table in the form of its 20 August 2002 letter, the negotiations were not advanced
and since Invesmart’s application had twice been rejected by the CNB, the Ministry was interested in whether the
CNB would approve its entry into Union Banka.

Trend would be paid a fixed monthly amount of CZK 100,000 and a contingency fee of CZK 5

million in “the event the Customer’s objective is successful".

The timing and content of this agreement indicates that having received a debriefing of the 24
September 2002 inter-agency meeting and having appointed Mr Vavra as its new CEO, Union
Banka then retained professional advisors to negotiate on its behalf.*° The retention of
advisors to assist in negotiations is indicative that a state aid package had not been agreed,
even in Union Banka’s view. Moreover, with the contract’s heavy weighting of compensation
towards a success fee, both parties explicitly recognised that the substantial part of Euro-
Trend’s fee would be paid only upon the attainment of the objective, i.e., the grant of the aid
being sought,

This contract, executed on the same day as the shareholders of Invesmart initially voted on the
capital increase, supports the finding that all parties, including Union Banka and Invesmart,
considered that they were about to engage in a process of negotiation, the outcome of which

was plainly hoped-for by the bank and the Claimant, but which could not be guaranteed.

Although it does not place great weight upon it, the Tribunal notes that an interview given by
on 24 February 2003, after the aid was refused, was consistent with its finding.
The interview quoted as stating that:

After obtaining a majority stake in Union banka, our first steps quite logically led to
the Ministry of Finance, where we wanted to begin discussion on what would
happen with the bank from now on. We received a letter signed by Mr. Janota
stating that the Ministry of Finance was ready and willing to look for a solution and
to assist in the restructuring of Union banka. In November, we therefore started
negotiations 2 (Emphasis added.]
This was put to: during cross examination. He testified that he could not
remember what was said on 24 February 2003 because the situation was very hectic and he
participated in many press interviews. He asserted that the quote attributed to him, that there
had been no negotiations before November 2002, was not accurate, He did accept, however,
that there were “many differences, absolutely” between the story published by Euro magazine
on 24 February 2003 and the case pleaded before the Tribunal.

230 The Tribunal notes that the parties to this Agreement understood the potential need for legal advice in supporting
the negotiations. Article 1.3 permitted Euro-Trend, with Union Banka’s consent, to seek advice on legal matters
“provided by subcontractors-specialized firms or by individuals conducting business pursuant to special regulations
(tax advisors, commercial lawyers, auditors etc.).”

341. Fourthly, the Tribunal notes that Euro-Trend’s First Proposal for Union Banka, dated 4
November 2002, was submitted to the Ministry of Finance 11 days after the Claimant says that
its expectation crystallised. The Plan set out the proposed CF Transaction (lowering of the
interest rate and the sale of the loan portfolio to CF) but also noted that there was a potential
connection between this aid (which Euro-Trend argued could not be characterised as a grant of
new state aid as suggested by what it called a “potential opinion” of the OPC) and the
resolution of Union Banka’s arbitration claim against the CNB:

The proposed grant of state aid may be further connected to the resolution of the
existing dispute between Union banka, a.s. and CNB, concerning the additional
reimbursement of losses from transactions of overtaken banks amounting to approx.
CZK 1.9 billion, such that no further requirement on fiscal funds would arise."*
342, This indicates that the form of the aid was still up for consideration even from Union Banka’s
perspective, Indeed, the BDS “receivable” can be seen as an attempt by the bank to find an
alternative to the CF Transaction, because Euro-Trend had been told on 25 October that that

transaction raised competition law issues.

343. Fifthly, the view of government officials who reviewed the First Proposal was that it required
more work, The minutes of the 5 November 2002 meeting recorded the view that “any aid
must be targeted, limited and pre-negotiated with the UOHS [OPC}” and that the “submitted
document, if the solution proposed therein is chosen, must be further supplemented by the
description of evaluation method, averaging of gained values, if appropriate, and by the
clarification of procedure used in ‘final calculation of the aid up to CZK 1.2 billion’".?35

344, Sixthly, the Tribunal notes that in the meetings held on 25 October, 5 November and 29
November 2002, there is no record of Union Banka, Euro-Trend or Invesmart ever
complaining that the issues then being discussed by the participants were inconsistent with
their earlier expectation that a concrete state aid package had been promised when the CNB
approved the share acquisition on 24 October 2002. The bank’s representatives did express
concem at the length of time that it would take to obtain the OPC’s approval, but there is no
suggestion in the minutes that the government was being accused of reneging on a prior

promise to deliver an agreed amount of state aid.

345. In brief, the documentary evidence surrounding 24 October 2002 indicates that the form of
state aid was not agreed and that negotiations were expected by all sides of the proposed
transaction. If there is any doubt on this point, it is put to rest by the next meeting of the parties
at which Euro-Trend’s Second Plan was discussed. This proposed changing the form of state

253 Exhibit R-13, First State Aid Plan elaborated by Euro-Trend, dated 4 November 2002, p. 8.

aid, envisaging that the state would implement one or more of the following measures: (i) the
lowering of the fixed interest rate on the Fores Deposit of 11.5 percent to a floating market
rate; (ii) the early termination of the Fores Deposit and its transformation into five-year
subordinated debt; (iii) the acquisition by CKA of a portfolio of non-performing assets at a
price determined by independent experts plus an additional amount of state aid; and (iv) a state
guarantee of a portfolio of loans.” The possibility of a state guarantee was raised by Euro-
Trend. There is no indication from the record that it had been discussed previously.

Having regard to all the evidence, the Tribunal considers that although Invesmart could
reasonably have held the view after 24 September 2002 that the Minister supported a potential
bail out of Union Banka, it could not have a legitimate expectation either as of that date or as
of 24 October 2002, when the CNB approved its acquisition of control of the bank, that the
Czech government had promised to grant state aid. Had it retained counsel to advise on the
competition law aspects of the state aid issue, it would have understood that the aid proposed
through the settlement of the bank’s relations with CF almost certainly did constitute state aid
under EU and Czech law and that the process of preparing a detailed justification for its
granting was necessary and without such a document the Minister and the Cabinet, let alone
the OPC, could not approve it.

Conclusion on legitimate expectations

347,

348.

Before concluding on the legitimate expectations claim, the Tribunal wishes to address one
other limb of the Claimant’s case.

It appeared to the Tribunal that the Claimant argued that to the extent that the evidence showed
that the Respondent had undertaken a commitment to a process as opposed to a result (the
latter being the Claimant’s primary position), the Respondent could not take advantage of its
own failure to comply with its domestic laws in failing to obtain the requisite approvals of the
Czech Cabinet and the OPC.” In its closing submissions, Invesmart argued that its case was
not that state aid would be supported in violation of Czech or EU law, but rather that the
Respondent “would take such steps needed to lawfully supply the promised state support.”.2"*
At another point, it asserted that its legitimate expectation was “a clean bank with a
combination of the Ceska Financn{ transaction and a contribution of the assumption of the

related-party loans with a net asset value of CZK 1.162 million”.””

349. No matter how the proposition is put, in the Tribunal’s view, the Claimant’s legitimate
expectation argument presupposed the approval of the Cabinet and the OPC. That is, on the
basis of what was communicated to Invesmart prior to 24 October 2002, state aid would have
been granted if the Minister had only submitted the request.

350. In the Tribunal’s view, this was not the case. Having regard to the legal framework that
governed the granting of state aid, the Minister could not simply rubberstamp the bank’s
application without evaluating its merits in terms of its potential to meet the requirements of
Czech and EU law.™° For an application to be submitted to the Cabinet, let alone be approved
by the OPC, the Minister had to be satisfied that it had a reasonable prospect of achieving the
goal of stabilising the bank. This required the applicant to submit a restructuring plan that met
the requirements of the law, and the Minister, the Cabinet and the OPC had to agree that the
plan met those requirements.

351. The Tribunal does not see how the Claimant's legitimate expectation that the Ministry of
Finance would follow a process meant that such expectation would deliver the desired result,
At the time that the expectation was said to have crystallised, the Respondent was not, in the
Tribunal’s view, in a position to promise that state aid would be granted. It could, and did,
undertake a commitment of process, but not of result and the Claimant should have understood
that to be the case. As the evidence shows, ultimately, the Minister concluded that the

Restructuring Plan did not have a reasonable prospect of success.

Inconsistency and ambiguity

The Claimant

352. The Claimant relied on a recent line of case law to argue that the Czech Republic breached the
fair and equitable treatment standard by failing to treat its investments "consistently" and
“without ambiguity".”*'

353. specifically, the Claimant ited that the R dent had acted i i by:

 

240 By the end of the hearing, it was common ground between the parties that the CNB is not vested with the
authority or power to decide whether state aid should be granted. That falls within the remit of the Minister of
Finance. Even then, the evidence is that the Minister does not possess final decision-making power; rather, having
evaluated a proposal, he decides whether to put it to Cabinet for its approval and by virtue of Czech law
implementing EU law, the Cabinet decision is not effective without the approval of the OPC. This is fundamental to,
and expressed in, the operation of the host state’s law on state aid and the Tribunal must have due regard to it.

It did not adopt conflicting positions toward Invesmart and Union Banka for it was
Invesmart and Union Banka, and not the Government, who introduced the CNB
Recievable as a potential mechanism to secure delivery of state aid in January
2003 even though the CNB Receivable had been discussed and rejected by the
Government a full two months earlier;2>*

The requirement that state aid be "pre-approved" by the OPC was not arbitrary;
rather it flowed from the then applicable Czech and EU law with which it was not
erroneous of the Government to insist compliance on the part of Invesmart. Failure
to comply warranted the denial of state aid;”*?

Tribunal’s analysis
Inconsistency - OPC approval

357. At the core of Invesmart's claim that is the allegation that the Government changed the rules of
engagement and following its assumption of the RPL's introduced a new requirement: that
state aid be subject to OPC approval.

358. This issue was also raised in the context of legitimate expectations. The Tribunal concludes at
paragraph 327 that the role of the competition authorities in vetting any proposed state aid,
including in respect of the CF transaction, was brought to the Claimant's attention before it
submitted its third application to acquire Union Banka on 22 October 2002. It follows from
this conclusion that when the Government informed Invesmart on 5 November 2002 that the
CF Transaction constituted "new" state aid and would be subject to OPC approval that there

was no change in position as the Claimant alleges.”*”
The run on Union Banka

359. At the hearing the parties agreed as to the specific wording of the comment Ms FriSaufova
made to the Czech media on 22 October 2002. Specifically, Ms Fri8aufova made the following
statement:

In this administrative proceeding the CNB did not grant its approval to Invesmart
for the acquisition of qualified interest in Union Banka because the investor failed
to provide the source of funding for the acquisition. As far as this proceeding is
concerned, the decision is final. This does not, however, preclude Invesmart from
filing a new application and ing new administrative ings on
granting the approval with the transfer of the shares.”

360. The Tribunal’s considers that these comments were ill-considered, given Union Banka's
already weak financial position. In late October 2002 the uncertainty surrounding Union Banka
was, in part, a consequence of the CNB Governor's advice to Invesmart submit a new
application to acquire a controlling interest in Union Banka rather than appeal the CNB's

rejection of Invesmart's second application during the appeal period 4 - 22 October 2002. The
CNB was aware that Invesmart had submitted a revised submission on 22 October 2002 and
this was recognised by the CNB spokeswoman. In consequence, the CNB’s approval of the
new application and the OPC’s approval of state aid were, at that time, open issues.

The destabilising impact of the CNB's comments is illustrated by the way the issue was
reported by the Czech media. In particular. a report published by Ceské Tiskova Kancelar
included the following sentence "Friaufova said she did not want to anticipate future
developments, but did not rule out that taking away the bank's license was one possibility".

That the run on Union Banka might have been avoided is shown by the fact that it was ended
when on 24 October 2002, the CNB approved Claimant’s application to acquire a share in
Union Banka and Union Group.

The statements in question, having been made publicly by the CNB spokeswoman, are
imputable to the CNB; the conduct of a state entity such as the CNB being attributable to the
Czech Republic. The Respondent cannot escape criticism in view of the recognised sensitivity
of public announcements in the banking sector.

That being said, the Tribunal holds that this conduct cannot amount, per se, in isolation, to a
violation of fair and equitable treatment. The Tribunal notes that at the time this statement was
made it was, strictly speaking, factually accurate. The purpose of making the statement was
explained by Governor Tima in cross-examination:

Everybody knew at that time that Union banka was in [a] difficult position, and the
pressure for the bank didn't occur after the statement by Mrs FriSaufova. The
pressure was long -- longer, for a longer period. We decided, and everybody knew,
of the general knew that -- and by the way, it was used as the argument that
the investor is applying and there is a chance that the investor would take over, and
this is -- so it was used also by the Union banka as the argument for the general
public that the situation would calm down.”

 

 

These comments by Governor Tima are persuasive. In particular, that the problems at Union
Banka existed many months prior to October 2002 and that the comments made by Ms
Fri8aufova are capable of being characterised as an attempt to reassure the public. Whilst these
comments may be criticised in retrospect, given the run that occurred on 23 October 2002, the
Tribunal is not satisfied that the conduct constitutes a breach of fair and equitable treatment.

The Respondent also asserted that the information contained in Ms Fri§aufova's statement was
already in the public domain. This contention is strongly supported by public statements made

by ~ prior to the comments made by Ms FriSaufova. The Respondent tendered
evidence that on 22 October 2002 Mlada fronta Dnes, one of the principal Czech National
dailies, reported that Invesmart had confirmed that it did not appeal against the decision of the
CNB to deny its second application to acquire Union Banka. This paper quoted

as saying "It is very complicated. It cannot be definitively said that we do not continue in our

negotiations. We are in contact with the CNB".”6!

Ultimately, the run on Union Banka occurred as a result of public perception that the prospects
of Union Banka being acquired by a foreign investor had declined. It may be equally fair to
speculate that this perception existed as a result of . comments, or both

and the CNB's comments taken together.

The CKA's proposal to settle the BDS arbitration claim

368.

369.

370.

At the 5 November meeting CKA proposed settlement of the BDS Arbitration Claim for CZK
1.8 billion as a means of conferring a benefit on Union Banka "that would not meet with a
negative response from the UOHS".”*’*The minutes of the meeting record that the proposal

would be put to the CNB expeditiously,”

the latter having not attended the meeting.
However, few days later, at a meeting held on 29 November 2002, the CNB rejected the
proposal since it “did not admit the Union Banka’s claim”. Mr Vavra for Union Banka,
present at the meeting together with a representative of Invesmart, took note of the CNB’s

position, no remarks or objection on his part being reflected by the minutes of the meeting.

Thus, Union Banka and Invesmart were made aware, about three weeks after the CKA’s
proposal, that the same could not be implemented due to the CNB’s opposition. The Tribunal
considers that a governmental entity against which an arbitral claim had been made, and which
was not represented at the meeting at which the settlement of the claim against it was

discussed, was entitled to state its objection when it became apprised of the discussion.

This conduct by the various entities of the Czech Republic does not amount to a violation of

The MOF's failure to submit the Third Restructuring Plan to the OPC

371, The reasons for the MOF’s rejection of the Third Restructuring Plan were given by Minister
Sobotka in his letter to Union Banka dated 20 February 2003. The application for state aid
having been rejected, there was no reason for the MOF to submit Union Banka’s application to
the OPC for an exemption from state aid prohibition, as mentioned by Minister Sobotka in the
same letter. The MOF’s prior approval was in fact a necessary pre-condition of the OPC’s
review of state aid proposals. Further, the MOF, after the many months spent in an attempt to
find a solution to the state aid issue, had no obligation to meet again with Union Banka to
explore alternative solutions. Union Banka’s financial situation at that point in time, as
confirmed by its CEO, Mr Vavra, on 19 February 2003, was so critical (“catastrophical”,
regarding the liquidity situation) as to suggest that no time was left for further discussions.”*

The MOF's “undertaking” to issue a resolution in support of Union Banka

372. The minutes of the 29 November 2002 meeting do not appear to reflect the Claimant’s
assertion that the Government undertook “to issue a public commitment in the form of a
resolution allowing an exemption on the ban on State aid” with the view of reassuring the
public and Union Banka's customers that the bank had the full support of the Government.”
The record shows that Mr Vavra proposed that:

Given the time needed to draw up a restructuring plan and the time it would take the
UOHS to issue a decision, the UB CEO asked if it would be possible to make use of
this period by submitting all the necessary material to the government, which would
then issue a resolution stating that the government had considered the issue and
would only assess the possibility of providing state aid to the bank on condition that
the UOHS allowed such aid to be provided under Law 59/2000 on State aid - in

Som the ban on state

other ‘cmption fom the ban on siate aid,

 

373. The somewhat confused record of this part of the minutes prompted a clarification by the First
Deputy Finance Minister (present at the meeting), who suggested that the exemption by the

MOF was not meant to refer to the ban on state aid but rather “to the comments procedure”.

374. Following that meeting, based on its understanding that the Government had accepted to issue
a resolution allowing an exemption on the ban on state aid, Union Banka circulated a draft of

> Exhibit R-151, letter dated 20 February 2003 from then-Minister of Finance Sobotka to Union Banka.

the Government’s resolution to that effect.

The draft resolution was unacceptable to the
Government since it amounted to the approval of state aid to Union Banka on condition of a
positive decision of the OPC,””' providing further that the amount and form of state aid
resulting from UB’s restructuring plan “shall be accepted by the Office for the Protection of
Competition”.?” [Emphasis added.]

The Czech Republic's renewed commitment to the EC

375.

376.

377.

378.

As already mentioned, the Czech Republic cannot be reproached for its alleged failure to alert
Invesmart about the need of the OPC’s approval of the state aid. The Claimant contends that
the Respondent should have informed Invesmart in a timely manner that obtaining such
approval had become more difficult following the Deputy Prime Minister’s commitment to the
EC that the Czech Republic would not provide any new aid to banks. Due to the terms of the
commitment so made (as reflected in the minutes of 29 November 2002 meeting),”” the

prospects of obtaining the EC’s approval of new state aid by the Czech Republic were reduced.

The minutes mention that “possible further aid to UB would mean a violation of the
commitment made by Deputy Prime Minister Pavel Rychetsky that the Czech Republic would
not provide any new aid to banks”.”” In the Claimant's view, this wording underlines the fact
that a serious additional obstacle existed to the granting of state aid to Union Banka, although
the OPC’s representatives indicated at the meeting that “they would not rule out the provision

of aid to the bank on principle”.?”

According to the Claimant, the significance of the Czech Republic’s failure to inform Union
Banka and Invesmart in a timely manner is made manifest by the fact that by 29 November
2002 Invesmart had already completed its acquisition of Union Banka and Union Group. The
Debt A ion A signed by on 17 N 2002 had in fact become
effective upon the transfer of shares in Union Banka and Union Group to Invesmart on

18 November 2002.7

The Claimant’s complaint is misplaced in more than one respect. As already indicated at

paragraph 319 above, the Deputy Prime Minister’s commitment to the EC that there would be

no more public subsidisation to the banks had been disclosed to Union Banka’s advisors, Euro-
Trend, at a meeting held on 25 October 2002. 2

Further, as also already discussed at paragraph 318 above, the relevant time for determining
whether Invesmart irrevocably committed to its investment in the bank without knowledge of
the Respondent’s commitment to the EC is not 16 October, but 4 November 2002.

The facts at hand may therefore be distinguished from the cases to which Invesmart referred in
making its claim. In the present case, no decisions or permits had been issued by the State on
which Claimant could reasonably rely to assume its commitments. This was the case in
Tecmed and MTD. No such reliance was justified by the CNB’s approval of Invesmart’s
acquisition of shares in Union Banka and Union Group since state aid had still to be cleared by
the OPC. Contrary to the Sa/uka case, where the tribunal found that the Czech Republic had
“acted inconsistently in its overall communications with IPB and Saluka/Nomura”,” no such
inconsistency may be imputed in the present case to the Czech Republic.

In the light of the foregoing, the Tribunal holds that Claimant’s claim of breach by the Czech
Republic of fair and equitable treatment for inconsistency and ambiguity of conduct fails.

Discrimination

The Claimant

382.

383.

384.

With regard to its fair and equitable treatment claim, Invesmart also submitted that the Czech
Republic's denial of state aid to Invesmart was discriminatory. The basis of this claim was
Invesmart's contention that between 1990 and 2004 the Czech Republic routinely provided
state aid to Czech banks whose circumstances were comparabie to those of Union Banka
whether viewed in terms of size, the-amount of aid to be provided, the form of aid or the
purpose of aid.”

Invesmart also argued that several of these banks had received emergency liquidity loans from
the Czech Republic and that the Czech Republic's refusal to provide similar support to Union
Banka was discriminatory.

In developing its submissions Invesmart referred the Tribunal to the Saiuka arbitration in
which the Czech Republic was found to have discriminated against a large Czech bank (IBP)
without justification when it denied IBP's requests for state aid while granting state aid to three

and Euro-Trend representatives.

of the four other major Czech banks. In Saluka the tribunal accepted that this discrimination
violated the fair and equitable treatment standard and the impairment clause. The Claimant
argued that Union Banka's circumstances were analogous to those of IBP and that it was

similarly discriminated against.

385, Invesmart went on to refer the Tribunal to its own analysis of state aid provided by the Czech
Republic, and its predecessor state, to banks between 1990 and 2004.”*° This analysis was
largely derived from information provided to the EC by the Czech Republic.”*' The Claimant's

 

on discrimination were also supp by Appendix A of the of
Claim which summarised the main forms of state aid that the Czech Republic provided to
banks between 1990 and 2004. This evidence was summarised in the following way by the

Claimant in opening submissions:

(a) 12 mid-sized and small Czech banks received state aid from 1996 to 2001,
including Prago Banka (1997), Agrobanka (1998) and PMB (2000, 2001);

(b) Four Czech banks received state aid from 2001 to 2005 including PMB, Ceska
Sportielna, Komercni Banka and CSOB;

© The Czech Republic provided vast amounts of state aid to promote restructuring
and onward sales to strategic investors including IPB, Komercni Banka, Ceska
Sporitelna, CSOB and Agrobanka.”

386. Invesmart also tendered expert evidence in support of its discrimination claim in the form of
two reports by Associate Professor Raj M Desai dated 6 December 2007 and 11 July 2008.
Professor Desai's first report was on the "relevant policies, methods and interests used in the
provision of state support and assistance to the banking sector in the Czech Republic between
the mid 1990s and mid 2000s".** Professor Desai's second report was in the form of a reply
opinion which sought to evaluate the submission made in the Statement of Defence that Union
Banka "could not be reasonably compared with other banks that received direct or implicit
state budgetary or off-budgetary assistance".**

387. Professor Desai's first report described the state aid provided to Czech banks under the first
and second Consolidation Programs and the Stabilisation Program in the 1990s. He opined that
from 1998 onwards it was the policy of the Czech Republic to find a strong private "strategic

investor" to assist with the privatisation and restructure of banks.”* A number of Czech banks
were privatised during this period and acquired by foreign investors, including IBP, Komercni
Banka, Ceska Sporitelna, COB and Agro Banka. Each was provided with state aid in various
forms.”** Finally, Professor Desai described a number of small and medium sized banks that
were granted state aid in the 1990s.”

In Professor Desai's second report much was made of the similarities between Nomura's
acquisition of IBP, that was the subject of the Saluka arbitration, and Invesmart's acquisition of
Union Banka. This was based on the contention that the problems afflicting both banks were
typical of those experienced by Czech Banks throughout the 1990s, The report stated:

Insufficient capital adequacy, related lending, non-transparency in ownership, and
consequent asset stripping and non-performing loans, were common across all
of Czech Banks in the 1990s -big and small, formerly state-owned or de novo.”

Professor Desai also opined that state aid was provided to numerous Czech banks from 2000
onwards. In paragraph 13 he states:

State aid was provided to numerous Czech banks after 2000. In particular, state
support to Ceské Spoiitelna, a.s., took the form of bad-asset transfers (in March
2000) and contingent guarantees (June 2000 and June 2001). In the case of
Komertnf Banka, a.s. (KB), state aid was provided through rescue and restructuring
support (March 2000) and guarantees as part of a sale of stock (October 2001).
Ceskoslovenké Obchodni Banka, a.s., (CSOB) received state aid in conjunction
with its acquisition of IPB (in June 2000), as well as through state-supported rescue
and restructuring operations (throughout 2000, 2001, and 2002).7*

The Respondent

The Respondent submitted that the factual record did not support Invesmart's discrimination

claim.

The Respondent referred the Tribunal to the test for discrimination enunciated by the Saluka
tribunal, namely as being whether (i) similar cases are (ii) treated differently (iii) without
reasonable justification.”

The Respondent submitted that the Tribunal should distinguish Union Banka's circumstances
from the facts in Saluka on the basis that in Saluka there was differential treatment between
four clearly analogous banks. The Respondent pointed to a number of similarities between IBP

and the three other major Czech banks: the four banks were all of a similar size; all had
portfolios of non-performing loans; all were undergoing a process of privatisation; the failure
of any of the banks would have had systemic consequences for the Czech banking sector.”

The Respondent went on to argue that no Czech banks operated under conditions similar to
those of Union Banka. It submitted that:

(a) Union Banka was one of a more diverse group of small privately owned banks,
some of which had been allowed to fail without the provision of state aid or

following the provision of state aid;””*

(b) Union Banka's balance sheet problems were the unique consequence of its
acquisition of the four smaller banks in the 1990s;?% and
(c) No similarly situated Czech bank was granted state aid in 2002 or 2003.7

The Respondent's submissions were supported by two expert opinions prepared by Professor
Dr Dr h.c. Claus-Dieter Ehlermann dated 25 March 2008 and 2 October 2008, respectively.

In particular, Professor Elhermann's analysis introduced a temporal aspect to the
discrimination case. Professor Ehlermann opined that "the situation in February 2003 was
different from and not comparable to the situation in which earlier privatisations and takeover

operations had taken place".
Professor Elhermann advanced two main arguments in support of this position.

First, the Czech Act on state aid, which was enacted on 1 April 2000 and entered into force on
1 January 2001, restricted the Czech Republic's legal right to grant state aid unless the OPC

approved the grant.”*

The implementation of the new law had a significant impact on the
preparedness of the Czech Government to make grants of state aid. Professor Elhermann
acknowledged that the Czech Republic made grants of state aid after the implementation of the
Act between January and June 2001. However, he suggested that these grants of state aid

related to ‘older’ negotiations that pre-dated the Act.?%*

Secondly, state aid controls were imposed on the Czech Republic as part of its accession to the

EU. Large sections of Professor Elhermann's first report were dedicated to describing how the

401.

402.

EC required that state aid control be implemented by the Czech Republic. These requirements
were not strictly observed by the Czech Republic between 1998 and 2001. However, Professor
Elhermann opined that the observance of these controls crystallised during the pre-accession
period which coincided with Invesmart's and Union Banka's negotiations with Czech

government officials concerning state aid.”””

At the core of Professor Elhermann's analysis was the distinction between the granting and
payment of aid. As Professor Elhermann stated in his second report:

... there is a fundamental different between the act of entering into a legally binding
commitment, i.e. the grant, on the one hand, and the acts of implementation, i.e. the
payments etc., on the other. These two different acts do not have the same character
and should therefore not be characterised to be "alike" for a meaningful comparison
under the principle of non-discrimination.”*
The Respondent conceded that since 2000 there have been many examples of state aid being
paid pursuant to arrangements made prior to 2001. However, the Respondent submitted that

from 2001 onwards only two grants of state aid were made to banks by the Czech Republic.””

In closing submissions these grants were described by Professor Crawford in the following
terms:

Since 2001 State aid was given to two banks and this aid was subsequently notified
to the European Commission in the document exhibits C17 and C18. Each of those
transactions has special features.

First in relation to PNB, this was a small bank in which the City of Prague had an
interest, and under an indemnity of 27 December 2001 an amount of [CZK] 3.43
million was paid by way of aid. That amounts to €114,000 by my calculation.

Secondly, Komercni Banka was granted a tax relief in relation to State aid
previously granted in an earlier year, which gave it an extraordinary profit. So in
effect the government accepted the argument that the earlier aid shouldu't, as it
were, be taken away in the form of taxation.®
In closing submissions the Respondent also tendered, without objection from the Claimant, a
table listing 21 examples where OPC denied requests for state aid between 2001 and 2004.7"
Similarly, in the Statement of Defence the Respondent listed four small and medium sized
banks that had been allowed to fail without the provision of state assistance.***

The Tribunal's analysis

403.

On the basis that the parties adverted to Saluka, when making submissions on the
discrimination issue and without engaging in an analysis of the correctness of that tribunal’s
treatment of discrimination as a part of the fair and equitable treatment standard, the Tribunal
will consider whether the evidence other Czech banks were (i) similarly situated to Union
Banka, yet (ii) treated differently (iii) without reasonable justification,

Were the other recipients of state aid similarly situated to Union Banka?

404.

405.

406.

407.

408.

The Tribunal is not satisfied that Union Banka was similarly situated to other Czech Banks
who received state aid at the time Union Banka sought it.

In its submissions the Claimant referred the Tribunal to numerous banks that received state aid
following the State's transition from a communism, many as part of the Consolidation and
Stabilisation Programs during the 1990s, The Tribunal notes that the parties agreed that
throughout the 1990s the Czech banking system was in crisis and that as a result the Czech
Republic, and its state, i three state aid p tor and
stabilise the banking system.” The parties also agreed that following the end of the
Stabilisation Program in 1998 aid was provided to Czech banks in order to avert the failure of
banks and to facilitate the sale of banks to foreign "strategic" investors.°™*

The Claimant placed significant emphasis on the state aid provided to Czech Banks during the
Second Consolidation Program in 1995-1996 and the Stabilisation Program between 1996 and
1998. For example, in its opening submissions Invesmart referred the Tribunal to 12 mid-sized
and small Czech banks that received state aid from 1996 to 2001. However, based on the
evidence contained in the first report of Professor Desai it is apparent that the arrangements for
the provision of this state aid were made between 1996 and 1998.

The Claimant said that Union Banka's problems were similar to those experienced by these
other Banks because they were typical of systemic problems that plagued the Czech banking
system throughout the 1990s. To wit, the key element of the Claimant's discrimination case
was that the Czech Republic, in denying state aid, including emergency liquidity loans, had
treated Union Banka differently to other banks that had similar problems.

In the Tribunal's opinion there are four key factors that arise from the Respondent's rebuttal of
the discrimination claim which contradict this analysis.

All.

First, the Respondent's claim that the policy of the Czech Republic towards the granting of
state aid changed as a consequence of its accession to the EU significantly. The entry into
force of the Czech Act on State Aid on January 2001 was a critical step in this process and it
was clear that after this time there was a marked reluctance by the Czech Republic to grant
state aid. This is supported by the fact that only two grants of state aid were made to banks
between 2001 and 2003. It is also supported by the numerous denials of requests for state aid
made by the OPC between 2001 and 2004. Further, it seems logical that the onus would be on
the Czech Republic to strictly observe its commitments to the EU in the pre-accession period,
particularly in respect of state aid control. No evidence was advanced by the Claimant that
contradicted this claim.

Secondly, the Respondent was correct to draw a distinction between the granting and the
paying of state aid. It is necessary for the Tribunal to compare the Government's decision to
deny state aid with other instances where the state aid was granted. The point at which the
decision was made and the Czech Republic assumed an obligation to pay state aid is the
relevant factor in the Tribunal's inquiry in respect of discrimination.

The Tribunal notes that questions regarding the relevance of the distinction between granting
and paying aid were put to Professor Desai in cross-examination. However, it is apparent from
the following exchange that Professor Desai did not incorporate this distinction or specifically
compare Union Banka's circumstances with those of banks who were granted state aid in 2002
and 2003.

Professor Crawford: You say in paragraph 13 of your opinion: "State aid was
provided to numerous Czech Banks after 2000". If, by that,
you mean State aid was disbursed to a number of Czech
Banks after 2000, then I can agree with you, ! think that is
certainly true. But do you give any example of - and, of
course, the words “after 2000” need clarification as well.
By "after 2000" I mean any event after Ist January 2001.

Professor Desai: T understand.

Professor Crawford: So after the end of the calendar year 2000. Do you give any
example in your opinion of a decision to grant State aid
made after the end of the calendar year 2000?

Professor Desai: In this section I wasn't trying to make a distinction between
grants and payments, which I do appreciate is a distinction
that is important, as you've presented it. However, there are
examples. From my understanding of the record, there are
examples of grants, new grants, made. I believe in -
certainly in 2000, you say -~

Professor Crawford: I said after the end of 2000

Professor Desai: One, my understanding, for the record, is that there were
some cases of grants made in 2001 I did not draw a

distinction between them in this paragraph because I was
not trying to make the distinction for the legal basis.*°

Thirdly, the circumstances of the two banks that received state aid in 2002-2003 can be readily
distinguished from the circumstances of Union Banka. In this regard, the distinction drawn by
the Respondent in closing submissions seems sound. The Claimant did not seek to contradict

this analysis, despite having been given the opportunity to do so.

Fourthly, it is highly relevant that there were other banks that were denied state aid and
allowed to fail between 2000 and 2004. There can be no finding of discrimination if banks
similarly situated to Union Banka are found to have been treated similarly to Union Banka.
The fact that other banks were denied aid suggests this may be the case. Neither party made
detailed submissions on the similarities between the small and medium banks that were denied
aid, other than by reference to their size and the widespread problems affecting numerous
Czech banks. The Claimant did not seek to distinguish Union Banka's circumstances from the
banks that failed.

Finally, it is necessary for the Tribunal to refer to the analogy drawn by the Claimant between
the facts in Saluka and the facts at hand. The Tribunal is of the opinion that the discrimination
against IBP in Sa/uka was fundamentally different to that to the Czech Republic's treatment of
Union Banka. This is because of the close comparison that the Sa/uka tribunal was able to
draw between IBP and the three other major Czech banks. In its award, the Saluka tribunal
noted that:

... irrespective of whether the bad debt problem with which the Big Four banks were
face from 1998 to 2000 may properly be characterised as "systemic" or not, these
banks were in a sufficiently comparable situation: All of them had large non-
performing loan portfolios resulting in increase provisions and consequently
insufficient regulatory capital. None of them was able to absorb the losses by
calling on shareholder equity. The survival of all of them was sooner or later
seriously threatened unless the Czech State was willing to provide financial
assistance. On the other hand, due to the macroeconomic significance of the Big
Four banks, the Czech State apparently could not afford to let any one of these
banks fail.’

The Tribunal is not satisfied that Union Banka was in a situation comparable to that of any
other Czech bank, let alone to all the other members of an identified class of Czech banks. The
question of whether Union Banka was similarly situated to other banks requires more than an
identification of single points of similarity, such as size, origin or private ownership. There

must be a broad coincidence of similarities covering a range of factors. The comparators must

96

be similarly placed in the market and the circumstances of the request for state aid must be
similar. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Invesmart has not demonstrated that Union
Banka was subject to discrimination by the Czech Republic.

Bad faith

The Claimant

416.

The final strand of Invesmart's claim for breach of fair and equitable treatment is its claim that
the Czech Republic acted in bad faith. In its Statement of Claim Invesmart advanced several
examples of conduct undertaken by the Czech Republic which it claimed were examples of
bad faith, including:

(a) The Respondent induced Invesmart to acquire Union Banka by committing to
the CF T: ion in exch for ion of the RPLs.
It then refused to complete the CF Transaction;

(b) The Respondent's decision (or effective decision) to deny state aid had the result of
saddling Czech taxpayers with a loss of CZK 18.5 billion, rather than providing
some CZK 650 million in aid to Union Banka;

(c) The Respondent mishandled the bankruptcy proceedings against Union Banka in
Usti nad Labem and in Ostrava. These proceedings, combined with criminal
prosecutions of senior officials involved with the Ostrava proceedings, constituted
a "deliberate conspiracy" by the Czech Republic against Union Banka.”

In its opening submissions Invesmart also claimed that the Czech Republic had acted in bad

faith by engaging in a course of conduct that comprised the following actions:
(a) failing to provide Invesmart with any notice of its decision to deny state aid;

(b) leaking the decision to deny state aid to the media the same day that Invesmart was

informed of the decision;

(c) commencing administrative proceedings to revoke Union Banka's banking licence
the day after state aid was denied;
(d) making inflammatory press statements over the course of 21 February 2003; and

3°7 Statement of Claim, paras 335-336.

(e) refusing to seriously consider four different plans put together by Invesmart and
Union Banka to salvage Union Banka.*°*

The Respondent

418.

The Respondent rejected the Claimant's allegation of bad faith. It submitted that the allegation
was primarily based on the existence of a commitment of state aid that, in fact, never existed.
In all other respects, the Respondent said, the Claimant's allegations of bad faith were

unsubstantiated and it was entitled to a presumption of good faith>°?

The Tribunal's analysis

419.

420.

421.

422.

423.

In making its allegation of bad faith the Claimant correctly pointed out that while acts of bad
faith violate the fair and equitable treatment standard, bad faith is not required to make out a
violation of the standard.

This was noted by the tribunal in Mondev International Ltd. v United States of America when
it stated that:

To the modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the
outrageous or the egregious. In particular, a State may treat foreign investment
unfairly and inequitably with out necessarily acting in bad faith.>"°

Similar sentiments were expressed by the tribunal in the Loewen case:

Neither state practice, the decisions of international tribunals nor the opinion of
commentators support the view that bad faith or malicious intention is an essential
element of unfair and inequitable treatment.*"'
In the Tribunal's opinion these statements notably draw an appropriate distinction between
other forms of unfair and inequitable conduct, such as manifest unreasonableness,
inconsistency and arbitrariness, and bad faith conduct, which has malicious or egregious intent,

such as deliberate conspiracy, as an essential ingredient.

The Tribunal was unable to identify this essential ingredient in the Respondent's conduct on

the evidence presented to it.

425.

The factual aspects of many of the Claimant's bad faith allegations have been considered by
the Tribunal in assessing other aspects of the Claimant's fair and equitable claim and its claims
under Article 5.1 of the BIT.

Rather than restate this analysis the Tribunal only raises those aspects of the evidence that are
specifically pertinent to the Claimant's allegation of bad faith.

Inducement to assume the RPLs

426.

427.

For the reasons set out in paragraphs above the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimant's
submission that the Czech Government induced Invesmart to assume the RPLs by undertaking
to complete the CF transaction. At paragraphs 347-351 the Tribunal has already concluded that
Invesmart could not have had a legitimate expectation that the Czech Republic would provide
any form of state aid.. Further, at paragraphs 290-291 the Tribunal observes that Addendum
No 4, which removed the provision of state aid as a pre-condition to SPA B, was dated 14
August 2002, seven days before it made its first proposal to the MOF on 20 August 2002. It
follows from these findings that there was no inducement by the Czech Republic and therefore
no bad faith.

Arguably, Invesmart entered these arrangements on the hope that state aid would be provided.
However, this was a commercial judgment, the risk for which must be bome by Invesmart.

Failure to choose the least cost option

428.

429.

430,

431.

The Tribunal next turns its attention to Invesmart's contention that in revoking Union Banka's
banking license the Czech Republic opted for a more costly alternative than providing the
requesied siate aid to Union Banka.

Invesmart raised this same argument in relation to its expropriation claim. Specifically,
Invesmart argued that the Czech Republic's expropriatory actions breached the BIT because
the revocation of the banking licence was not in the public interest; the Czech Republic opted

for the more costly course of action rather than grant state aid.

This argument mischaracterises the concept of bad faith. A government cannot be accused of
acting in bad faith merely because it chooses one of several policy alternatives. Even where the
course of action adopted is capable of criticism there is no showing of bad faith absent

egregious intent.

The allegation is especially misguided given the evidence that it was not clear that the
provision of state aid was the least-cost alternative given the dire financial circumstances of
Union Banka in February 2003. It was reasonable, given the fragile liquidity situation of Union
Banka, for the Minister of Finance to consider that even if aid were provided the future

99

solvency of Union Banka would still be highly uncertain. It was, by February 2003, a case of
putting good money after bad.

The proceedings in Usti nab Labem and the allegation of deliberate conspiracy
432. In its opening submissions the Claimant described these proceedings thus:

That was a criminal proceeding to steal the bank's assets. The Czech Government
itself has prosecuted the judge, the bankruptcy trustee and several other
Government official that were involved in the Usti nab Labem debacle ... Asa
result of this sham proceeding the bank was actually seized by a band of armed men
.. who described himself as the bankruptcy trustee. and others were

forced out of the bank. The situation was resolved to the Czech Republic’ 's credit, in
four or five days, but it may say something about motive in this case.>

433. The Tribunal assumes that the reference to motive in the Claimant's opening submissions is a

reference to the allegation that the Usti nab Labem proceedings represented a deliberate

conspiracy against Union Banka pertaining to high levels of the Czech Government.

434, The Tribunal finds that there is no evidence that such a conspiracy existed. Whilst the conduct
of the judge in the proceedings is attributable under Article 4 of the BIT to the Czech
Republic, the Tribunal notes that the Czech Republic took swift action to ameliorate the
situation, that the assets of Union Banka were not in fact looted as a result of the decision, that
the judge actually reversed the decision himself and that the Czech Republic has taken
criminal action against him. Given the efficiency with which the Czech Republic acted in
relation to the Usti nab Labem proceedings it is impossible to conclude that a conspiracy was

afoot. i
Impairment clause

Applicable legal standard

435, Article 3(1) provides that with reference to the investments of investors of the other
Contracting Party |
Each Contracting Party ... shall not impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory
the operati use, enjoy, or disposal
thereof by those investors.

436. Before considering the parties' submissions in respect of alleged breaches of the impairment
clause it is necessary to consider whether this standard operates as separate and freestanding
protection that offers protection to investors independently of the first limb of Article 3(1) of
the BIT, the fair and equitable treatment standard,

3” Transcript, Day 1, p. 70, lines 9-21. |

437.

438.

439.

440.

442.

443.

The Tribunal notes that the parties disagree on this question.

In its Statement of Defence the Respondent contended that the impairment standard in Article
3(1) of the BIT "is not, in fact, a separate, free-standing standard that can add anything" to
Invesmart's claims under the fair and equitable treatment and expropriation standards.*"?

The Respondent based this analysis on comments made in Sa/uka that

[in] so far as the standard of conduct is concerned a violation of the non-impairment
requirement does not therefore differ substantially from a violation of the "fair and
equitable treatment" standard, The non-impairment requirements merely identifies
more specific effects of any such violations.’

By contrast the Claimant described the ionship between the dards of

described in Article 3(1) in the following terms:

the Czech Republic is required to treat | the investments of Dutch investors fairly
ql ly, and it is ited from impairing such i by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures . . Furthermore, since the phrase
“unreasonable or discriminatory measures" in Article 3(1) uses the disjunctive "or"
instead of the conjunctive "and", it is clear that either "unreasonable" or
"discriminatory" measures will violate the impairment clause.°!*
In the Tribunal's opinion the Claimant's characterisation of Article 3(1) as comprising two
separate standards is correct. It is not for the Tribunal to speculate about the circumstances in
which a factual allegation may be held to constitute a breach of the impairment clause but not
fair and equitable treatment. However, the Claimant is entitled to invoke the protections
afforded by both clauses.

The Saluka tribunal edged that the dards of " and "discrimination"
contained in the impairment clause have no different meaning than in fair and equitable
treatment. However, it also recognised that it offered a separate standard of protection. This is

borne out by the tribunal's separate analysis of Saluka's claims under the impairment clause.
In the Tribunal's opinion the Claimant was thus correct when it stated:

The plain wording of Article 3(1) demonstrates that it contains two distinct legal
standards. Additionally, under cardinal principles of treaty interpretation, the
impairment clause must be interpreted in a manner that gives it substance and
meaning, rather than as mere surplusage that adds nothing to the fair and equitable
treatment clause.”

36 Reply Memorial, para 377.

444, The Tribunal further agrees with the Sa/uka tribunal's analysis about the meaning of the
standard enshrined in the impairment clause when it states:
"Impairment" means, according to its ordinary meaning (Article 31 of the Vienna

Convention on the Law of Treaties), any negative impact or effect caused by
"measures" taken by the Czech Republic.

The term "measures" covers any action or omission of the Czech Republic. As the
ICJ has stated in the Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Spain v Canada)...

[In its ordinary sense the word is wide enough to cover any act, step or proceeding,
and imposes no particular limit on their material content or on the aim pursued
thereby ...

The standard of "reasonableness" therefore requires, in this context as well, a
showing that the State's conduct bears a reasonable relationship to some rational
policy, whereas the standard of "non-discrimination" requires a rational justification
of any differential treatment of a foreign investor.

445. The Tribunal need not replicate its analysis of the Claimant's discrimination claim here. It will
limit its analysis to those aspects of the unreasonableness claim that have not been dealt with

above.
Unreasonableness
The Claimant

446. In its Statement of Claim Invesmart listed more than a dozen actions or courses of conduct
taken by the Czech Republic which it claimed were unreasonable and, in consequence, in

breach of the impairment clause.
447. These actions included:

(a) approving an investment predicated on the CF Transaction without confirming its
ability and willingness to carry out that commitment;

(b) approving an investment predicated on state aid and then failing to provide any

form of state assistance;

(c) causing a run on the bank by suggesting that it was struggling to find an acceptable

investor at the very moment it was approving Invesmart's application;

(d) insisting upon state aid alternatives and pre-approval from the UOHS, working
with Invesmart to put together a new restructuring plan that satisfied those

conditions, and then rejecting the plan;

) promising to make a public declaration supporting the bank and then failing to do
so;

102

refusing to give Invesmart or Union Banka any notice or warning about its
decision to reject the restructuring plan and to deny state aid, thereby preventing
them from locating alternative sources of capital, and thus ensuring the bank

 

would fail;

(g) leaking that decision to the press, thereby commencing another run on the bank
and further ensuring the bank would fail;

(bh) refusing a liquidity loan on the basis that the bank could not provide "liquid

(i) refusing to seriously consider the salvage plans put together by Invesmart and
Union Banka to avoid liquidation, thereby ensuring the complete loss of
Invesmart's investments; ,

G) saddling Czech taxpayers with a financial burden, through the liquidation of Union
Banka, that was at least 28 times greater than the CZK 650 million in state aid that
the Government refused to provide;

(k) subjecting Union Banka to the fraudulent bankruptcy proceeding in Usti nad
Labem;

() subjecting Union Banka to the corrupt bankruptcy proceedings in Ostrava; and

(m) failing to notify Invesmart of the bankruptcy proceeding for Union Group.*!”

448. In its Reply Memorial Invesmart reformulated this claim and submitted that four aspects of

this conduct were particularly egregious. Specificaiiy:

()

(b)

(©)

The Czech Republic acted unreasonably when the CNB approved Invesmart's
acquisition of Union Banka with the understanding that the acquisition was the
first step in a three-step restructuring plan, only then to renege on step two,
namely, the Government's completion of the Foresbank settlement;

The various organs of the Czech Republic failed to take a coordinated and
consistent position regarding the provision of state aid after approving Invesmart's
acquisition of Union Banka;

The Government's decision to deny state aid was made on grounds that were
unreasonable, Invesmart's primary complaint against the Czech Republic was that
Mr Sobotka's decision to deny state aid was made on the basis of the Government's

37 Statement of Claim, para 342.

103

 

449.

  

strategy in the Saluka arbitration. Invesmart also claimed that the decision to deny

state aid was unreasonable because:

(i) Minister Sobotka disregarded the opinion of Governor Tima, which
was given at the request of Minister Sobotka, that "a sufficient media
presentation of public support which would lead to a suspension of
deposit outflow"; and

Gi) Minister Sobotka concluded that the settlement was legally unviable
without seeking legal advice.

(d) The Government failed to give Invesmart adequate notice of its decision to deny

state aid.

The Claimant has itself acknowledged that these allegations replicate many of those made in
respect of fair and equitable treatment and expropriation claims. For this reason the Tribunal
will consider only aspects of Invesmart's unreasonableness claim that require elaboration in
relation to the application of the reasonableness standard. Specifically, the question of whether
it was unreasonable for the CNB to approve Invesmart's acquisition of Union Banka and then
for the MOF to deny Invesmart's request for state aid.

The Respondent

450.

451.

In answer to the allegation that it had acted unreasonably by reneging on its obligations under
a three-step restructuring plan, the Czech Government denied that such a restructuring plan
existed.*'? The Respondent argued that this allegation was unfounded given that Invesmart
had no specific expectation of state aid and that such a commitment could not reasonably be
gleaned from the CNB's approval of Invesmart's application to acquire Union Banka.

The Respondent further argued that Invesmart had failed to demonstrate that this conduct had
no rational policy basis when viewed in light of Czech law or international standards of
banking regulation. The Respondent submitted:

There could be no doubt at the time the CNB prior approval was issued that all that
approval did was a clear and necessary regulatory hurdle for Invesmart to invest in
the Czech banking sector. This followed transparently both from a legal provisions
establishing a need for such approval (section 20A of the Banking Act at Exhibit R-
304) and from the clearly delineated distinction between the role of the CNB as the
authority of the State responsible for monetary policy and banking system.

supervision and that of the MOF as the fiscal authority, delineated not only in
Czech Law, but also as a matter of general international practice.*”°

The Tribunal's analysis

The reasonableness of the CNB's approval

452.

453.

454.

455.

456.

The question of what the parties understood to be the significance of the CNB's approval is
considered in the Tribunal's discussion of legitimate expectations at paragraphs 264-265
above. The Tribunal has concluded that the evidence does not demonstrate that any of the
parties, including Invesmart, understood that approval by the CNB constituted a commitment
that the Foresbank settlement or any other form of state aid would be provided.

The remaining question is therefore whether it was unreasonable for the CNB to approve
Invesmart's application to acquire Union Banka and for the MOF to deny its request for state
aid.

The standard to apply in assessing this question is whether the conduct of the Czech Republic
bore a reasonable relationship to some rational policy. This question is to be distinguished
from any consideration of the merits of the policy adopted by the Czech Republic.

The Tribunal notes that Professor Shin, in his first expert report, suggested that on any view
the conduct of the CNB and the MOF fell short of international regulatory best practice.

For example, in his first expert report Professor Shin stated:

The CNB as the bank supervisor approved the acquisition of Union Banka by
Invesmart on October 24 2002. I see three mutually exclusive possibilities

concerning consultations between the CNR and the Ministry of F:

concerning cons! e CNB and the Ministry of Fix

 

 

a, Either the CNB did not consult the Ministry of Finance before giving approval of
the acquisition,
b. Or the CNB consulted the Ministry of Finance, but the CNB approved the

acquisition without receiving formal approval from the public funding support by
the MOF.

c. Or the CNB consulted the MOF and the CNB received formal approval of public
funding support from the MOF before granting approval of the acquisition.

I find (a) inconceivable for a responsible banking supervisor. If the CNB did not
consult the MOF at all this would be highly irresponsible, this would be a highly
irresponsible act by a banking supervisor. The Basel Committee report makes it
clear that such a course of action would run counter to international best practice ....

9 Statement of Defence, para 411.

105

457.

458.

459.

460.

461.

Leaving (a) to one side, I am left with (b) and (c). Here I am faced with a great deal
of uncertainty concerning the facts of the case. However, neither (b) nor (c) put the
Czech authorities (collectively) in good light.

a. If (b) is true, so that the CNB gave approval of the acquisition without obtaining
formal approval of funding from the Ministry of Finance, then the CNB did not
follow international best practice. It sanctioned a course of action that entailed the
use of public funds without authorisation from the Ministry of Finance. Thus, if (b)
is true, the CNB acted against international best practice.

b. If (c) is true, then the Ministry of Finance gave the formal go-ahead to the CNB
to approve the acquisition of Union Banka by undertaking to fund the cost of public
support. If this is the case, then I am puzzled by why the MOF did not provide
public funding support for the acquisition as contemplated. Thus, if (c) is true, the
actions of the Ministry of Finance are at fault.>”!

This opinion was rejected by the Respondent, who tendered the expert opinion of Professor

Saunders. Professor Saunders stated that:

It is well-established best practice to separate the central banking function from the
political and fiscal governmental authorities..

These entities [the MOF and Central Bank] have different t policy objectives and
potentially different views as to what is least cost policy.*””

Professor Saunders went on to make the following conclusion:

The behaviour of the Czech National Bank was entirely reasonable. In contrast, it
would not have been reasonable for the CNB to deny the regulatory approval under
the information that was available to it at the time, since it would have eliminated
any possibility that Invesmart and the Ministry of Finance could come to an
agreement.”
The Tribunal does not consider that it is required to form an opinion about the merits of the
policies that underpinned the decisions made by the MOF and CNB. A state should not be held
to an obligation to act in accordance with international best practice. To read such an
obligation into a BIT is untenable.

The Czech Republic can be held to have acted reasonably so long as, in the Tribunal's view, it
did so out of some reasonable policy consideration, as opposed to conduct that was motivated

by the intention to deprive an investor of the value of its investment.

At paragraph 264 above the Tribunal explained why in its opinion the CNB acted in
accordance with its supervisory functions when it approved the acquisition by Invesmart of
Union Banka. This involved a number of elements, including that the CNB be satisfied of the
providence of Invesmart's funds. Once the CNB was satisfied of Invesmart's bona fides it

463.

approved the acquisition because, in the absence of any other investor, Invesmart's
involvement was the best chance available of securing the bank's stability. This view point is

consistent with evidence given by Governor Tima at the hearing:

THE CHAIRMAN: Why did you approve its [Invesmart's] acquisition?

GOVERNOR TUMA: Because in the end we believed they would be able to
deliver that money. They committed themselves. It means -- generally speaking, it's
not an easy decision to close the bank. So that you look for chances how to avoid
that. You look for potential mergers and so on. So there was an investor, and I
believed at that time, I trust, that was fair and honest person.
Unfortunately it was my biggest mistake, probably, and -- but in the end we
believed that that commitment by the shareholders meeting was fair and that
Invesmart would be able to deliver the money. So -- but we are speaking about that
wasn't a substantial company, so explaining that at the time this was -- I am just
saying this was a crucial issue, but in the end we decided to try it. So it was a
chance and we didn't want to kill it

Whilst the merits of this decision may be questioned, this is not a matter for this Tribunal. It is
clear that the Czech Republic acted in the interests of legitimate policy concerns, being the
ongoing survival of Union Banka, and cannot, therefore be said to have acted unreasonably.

Similarly, the evidence clearly suggests that the MOF acted in accordance with rational policy
consideration. There is no need to restate the Tribunal's analysis about the justification for the
MOF's decision to deny state aid. These actions were clearly reasonable in the circumstances.
Any fault that may be found in the Czech Republic's actions falls far short of establishing a
breach of the impairment clause,

Expropriation

464.

465.

The Claimant alleged that the Respondent expropriated its investment in Union Banka through
a combination of measures ranging from the denial of state aid to the revocation of Union

The Claimant's expropriation claim primarily focused on the Respondent’s revocation of
Union Banka’s licence and placing the bank into bankruptcy and liquidation, which according
to the Claimant, amounted to a direct expropriation or, in the alternative, an indirect
expropriation.’ The revocation and ensuing measures “overtly purported to interfere with
Invesmart’s rights” and as a result it was “legally and practically deprived of its rights in
Union Banka".””’ The Claimant also submitted that in taking these measures the Respondent
did not comply with the three requirements of Article 5 which, if cumulatively satisfied, make

an act of expropriation lawful under the Treaty.

In respect of Article 5(a), Invesmart claimed that the measure were not in the public interest
because by closing and liquidating Union Banka the Government saddled Czech taxpayers
with a financial burden that was many times greater than granting state aid (estimated by the
Claimant to be some 28 times as much as the aid sought).”* Invesmart's expert on banking
regulation, Professor Hyun Song Shin, noted that this could not be in the public interest under
the “least cost principle", observed in international best practices for the resolution of weak
banks.*”* In this case, the Respondent deliberately chose the most expensive solution, thereby
acting against the public interest.*°

In Invesmart's view the Respondent also violated Article 5(b) because notwithstanding its
majority ownership of Union Group, it received no notice of the bankruptcy petition.
Moreover, the bank’s assets were then liquidated as part of a fraudulent bankruptcy proceeding

in Ostrava.**!

Invesmart further argued that contrary to Article 5(b) the closure and liquidation of the bank

and Union Group was discriminatory. The treatment accorded to Union Banka was said to be

“markedly less favorable than that received by a number of other similarly situated Czech
banks".>*? (This aspect of the expropriation claim was developed in more detail in the

Claimant’s separate discrimination complaint under Article 3).

The Claimant also asserted that Article 5(c) was violated since the Czech Government never
paid compensation to Invesmart for the expropriation of its investments in the bank and Union

Group23

In developing its submissions the Claimant endorsed the proposition that foreign investors are

not presumptively immune from a host state’s police or regulatory powers:

.+. a well-founded, non-discriminatory exercise of a state’s police or regulatory
power, conducted for the purpose of protecting the public interest and with respect
for due process, does not entail an “expropriation” under international law.
However, neither of these propositions is responsive to Invesmart’s position in this
case, which is that the Czech Republic’s taking of Invesmart’s investments was not
a proper exercise of governmental power.*™* [Emphasis in original.]
In developing this point, the Claimant referred back to the merits of the Minister’s decision to
deny state aid and his failure to provide any notice of that decision, as well as the CNB’s
refusal to provide a liquidity loan. The resulting bankruptcy and liquidation process imposed
the large financial burden already noted and the measures at issue in this case were said to be

very far removed from a proper, legitimate exercise of regulatory power.

The Claimant distinguished Union Banka's situation from the situation that existed in Saluka.
Here there was an “abject failure of notice or due process” in relation to the decision to deny
State aid, the leaking of that decision to the public which inevitably resulted in the bank’s
failure, the revocation of its licence and its liquidation. Moreover, unlike the present case,

Saluka did not raise any public interest questions.*””

The Claimant also submitted that the Minister acted on improper grounds, namely its ‘litigation
strategy’, in the Saluka arbitration when denying state aid to Union Banka. **° In support of this
assertion, the Claimant relied upon a letter of legal advice dated 3 December 2002, which was
produced by the Respondent, advising the MOF that:

From the point of view of the possible impact on the on the [sic] arbitration
proceedings in progress between Saluka and the Czech Republic, we feel it would
be best if the State aid was not provided. We must stress, though, that this is a very
narrowly defined perspective. If, in view of the wider context and economic reasons

in particular, the decision is taken to provide aid, we are ready to defend this
decision in arbitration proceedings, subject to the condition that the State aid is duly
authorized by the Czech Office for the Protection of Economic Competition. In
view of the sensitive nature of this matter, we would prefer to let you know the
arguments on which our standpoint is based face-to-face. °°”

Invesmart listed further procedural complaints, including that:

(a) the Government failed to communicate with Invesmart and Union Banka for

several critical weeks in February 2003;

(b) the Ministry failed to inform Invesmart of the denial of state aid until after the
decision was leaked to the press;

(c) CNB denied a liquidity loan to Union Banka on spurious grounds in order to
ensure that the bank would be forced to close and then commenced revocation

proceedings; and

(d) the proceedings to bankrupt and liquidate Union Banka were marred by procedural

irregularities, including the dismissal of the principal trustee for fraud.?3*

The Respondent

477.

478.

479.

The Respondent’s submissions on the Minister’s decision for denying state aid have already
been recorded in the Tribunal’s discussion of the legitimate expectations claim. They need not
be repeated here.

Insofar as the licence revocation and the ensuing measures are concerned, the Respondent
denied that anything approaching a direct expropriation had occurred. It observed that the
revocation of the licence and the bank’s subsequent liquidation left intact Invesmart’s
shareholding in Union Group and Union Banka and did not affect its shareholding as such.
This meant that the Claimant was left to argue that the State’s actions constituted an indirect
expropriation insofar as they deprived it of any value that it might have had.*”

The Respondent also took issue with the Claimant’s characterisation of the measures as
expropriatory. The Respondent submitted that the CNB’s administrative proceeding was a

lawful regulatory measure within the state’s police powers, for which no compensation was

required. The powers pursuant to which the CNB took action were based in published Czech
law and pre-dated the Claimant’s involvement with Union Banka.*“°

Referring to the Saluka case for the proposition that when exercising banking regulatory
powers the CNB enjoyed “a margin of discretion” which had to be considered by a tribunal
applying Article 5 of the Treaty, the Respondent noted that that tribunal concluded that the
deprivation of that claimant's investment constituted a non-compensable deprivation because it

was based on an exercise of regulatory powers in the public interest.*"'

The Respondent went on to argue that in any event, even if the CNB’s measures could be
characterised as expropriatory, the steps taken met the various requirements of Article 5 for a
lawful expropriation in that they were (i) in the public interest and under due process of law;
(ii) not discriminatory; and (iii) since the value of Invesmart’s investment (if it actually had
made one) was at the time negative, there was no failure to compensate the Claimant for the
value of its investment.”

Finally, in the Respondent’s view, the Claimant's reliance on the “least cost principle’ was
inapposite. Even if it constituted a generally accepted bank regulatory practice and it was
violated in the instant case (which was denied), it would not rise to the level of a breach of an

intemational obligation and would not support a claim for breach of the Treaty.>*?

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Minister’s decision to deny state aid

483.

484,

The expropriation claim has been linked to the fair and equitable treatment claim in that the
Minister’s reasons for denying state aid and the means by which that information was
conveyed to Invesmart (and allegedly to the public) have figured in both claims. The Tribunal
has already explained that it does not consider that the denial of state aid amounted to a breach
of Article 3.

Tuming to the expropriation claim, the Tribunal begins with a consideration of the law. It
agrees with the Respondent's argument that in relation to ministerial decisions on expenditures
of state revenues, a “margin of appreciation” that recognises the discretionary features of such
decisions must be accorded to them.** Ministers must make often difficult, multivariable

decisions that do not necessarily admit of clear right or wrong answers. For example, a
minister who chooses to deny state aid, as in this case, faces questions about the possibly
greater expense attached to such a denial. As the Claimant argued forcefully, why deny the aid
when the cost of doing so is so much higher than granting it?’ The answer lies in other

policy and legal considerations which a minister must have regard to.

The Tribunal also agrees with an observation made by the Saluka tribunal in the context of its
fair and equitable treatment discussion:

It is also very doubtful whether a Government can be said to be under an
international legal obligation always to choose the least cost alternative and not to
waste taxpayers’ money.

An international tribunal must approach a minister’s decision not to spend taxpayers’ money

with circumspection.

This is not to say that the Tribunal considers that the Minister’s decision in this case is beyond
review, for it is not. Were it convinced that the Minister acted for wholly improper reasons, for
example, in denying aid that he and his advisors considered should have been granted to Union
Banka solely because granting the aid might complicate the defence of the Sa/uka claim, the
Tribunal would not hesitate to find that the Minister’s act attracted international responsibility
(though more likely under Article 3 than Article 5).

However, the Tribunal is of the view that the Saluka litigation strategy concern was not the
primary or even a significant reason for the denial of state aid. In the Tribunal’s view, it was
likely a factor but not a dominant factor because the legal advice itself was qualified,

Furthermore, there are other compelling reasons that explain the Minister's actions.

The record shows that by January 2003, before the Third Restructuring Plan was submitted to
the Ministry of Finance, grave problems had been identified by the bank’s new management.

First, the new management had carried out an in-depth inspection of the bank and had decided
to create extra adjustments to cover bad loans totalling CZK 1.8 billion.” Secondly, in
principle this was covered by the “BDS Receivable", but if that claim was “taken off the
balance-sheet at Union Banka, a.s., the Bank would not be able to satisfy the basic ratios set
for managing a bank and would have to cease operating as a bank".** Thirdly, although the

more realistic approach towards the quality of the assets and risk of the Bank’s portfolio adopted by the new
management team for restructuring.”

amount now being sought from the Respondent was higher than in previous plans, the result of
the plan if state aid was granted was modest: after cleaning up its balance sheet, the bank “will
be capable of generating an [annual] net profit of between CZK 30 million and CZK 50
million". The Plan acknowledged that this “figure is wholly insufficient in terms of the bank’s
balance-sheet, number of branches, workforce and capital and would not allow the bank to
continue to operate in the long-term".*”” Finally, there was a gap between what Invesmart had

committed to in terms of a capital injection, and what was needed to rescue the bank:

The investor has repeatedly stressed that they cannot make any further investments
to complete restructuring of the bank’s balance-sheet. Instead they are relying on
the repeated assurance that the State would contribute to rectifying the effects of the
Consolidation P: and Stabilisation Pr to a not insigni:

extent.

It is unrealistic to assume that another investor could be found who would be
willing to intervene as a very minor shareholder and yet contribute to a significant
improvement in the bank’s balance-sheet. Invesmart on the other hand is refusing to
increase the registered capital because they do not have the funds to invest in
increasing the registered capital and they do not agree to their stake being watered
down, because this does not form part of their investment strategy and the price of
their stake would then cease to make economic sense.**”

In short, the additional work completed on the restructuring plan showed that the bank’s

situation was even more grave than had previously been understood and Invesmart was not

prepared to contribute more capital than it had stated it was already committed to provide.

In making its finding that the denial of state aid does not amount to an expropriation, the
Tribunal has not relied principally on the testimony of then-Finance Minister Sobotka (who
denied that the Saluka case was the reason that he denied the aid), but rather has examined the

contemporaneous documents.**!
The Tribunal considers that the record, viewed in its entirety, shows that:

(a) the bank’s financial condition was very poor, and indeed if not technically
insolvent in January—February 2003, it was perilously close to being so;

(b) the Restructuring Plan’s projections, even if the state aid and Invesmart’s €90
million were injected into the bank, showed a minimal improvement in the bank’s
fortunes;

(c) the bank did not submit an auditor’s opinion with the Plan such that the reliability
of the Plan was suspect (particularly in light of the bank’s history of lack of

38 Id., p. 35.
39 Id, p. 27.
*5! Transcript, Day 3, Sobotka, pp. 79-83.

113

transparency — a problem which, as just noted, was being dealt with by the bank’s

new management); and

(d) the plan could well fail, in which case the Ministry would be throwing away

taxpayers' money on a rescue that was destined to fail.

494, These factors had to be evaluated within the regulatory framework for state aid and the
increased scrutiny by the European Union of Czech governmental measures in this area. In
short, a review of the Third Restructuring Plan in light of all the surrounding circumstances
shows that the Minister not unreasonably found that the Plan did not present a sufficient degree
of certainty for the Finance Ministry to support its submission to,the Cabinet and the OPC for

their respective approvals.

495. Accordingly, that part of the expropriation claim which relies upon the denial of state aid is

Tejected.
The revocation of Union Banka’s licence

496. Turning to the revocation of the bank’s licence, before addressing the facts and considering
this aspect of the claim at the level of principle, the Tribunal observes that it is confronted with
a measure taken under a banking statute of general application, which statute predated the
Claimant’s investment. Section 26(b) of the Czech Banking Act, the statutory power pursuant
to which the CNB acted, provides as follows:

(1) If the Czech National Bank ascertains shortcomings in the operations of a bank
ora branch of a foreign bank, depending upon the nature of the ascertained |
shortcoming(s), it is authorized:

ee
b) to change the banking licence by excluding or restricting certain activities
stipulated in the licence;?* {
497. There is no doubt that Section 26(b) is a bona fide non-discriminatory regulation aimed at the |
general welfare. All states with modern banking regulatory regimes vest a licensing power in i

their regulators. Inherent in such regimes is the power not only to grant but to revoke the

licence.

498. International investment treaties were never intended to do away with their signatories’ right to
regulate. As found in Saluka, where the instant Treaty was being applied, notwithstanding the
breadth of its prohibition against expropriation and the absence of an express regulatory power |
exception, Article 5 imports into the Treaty the customary international law notion that a |
deprivation can be justified if it results from the exercise of regulatory actions aimed at the |

maintenance of public order.*** This is common sense. Otherwise, once having granted a
licence to operate a bank, the regulator could be constrained from revoking a licence if such

action were automatically to be labelled an expropriation at international law.
The Tribunal thus agrees with the Saluka tribunal’s finding that:

It is now well established in international law that States are not liable to pay
compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their regulatory
powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner bona fide regulations that are
aimed at the general welfare.*™
Although there is no question as to the regulatory bona fide of Section 26(b), the Tribunal must
also determine as a matter of international law whether the licence revocation on the facts of

this case was improper, which plainly could constitute an expropriation. Reverting to Saluka:

It thus inevitably falls to the adjudicator to determine whether particular conduct by
a state “crosses the line” that separates valid regulatory activity from expropriation.
Faced with the question of when, how and at what point an otherwise valid
regulation becomes, in fact and effect, an unlawful expropriation, international
tribunals must consider the circumstances in which the question arises. The context
within which an impugned measure is adopted and applied is critical to the
determination of its validity.>®* [Italics in original.]
A decision to revoke a bank’s licence, which takes place within a detailed national legal
framework that includes administrative and judicial remedies, is not reviewed at the
international law level for its “correctness", but rather for whether it offends the more basic
requirements of international law. Numerous tribunals have held that when testing regulatory
decisions against international law standards, the regulators’ right and duty to regulate must
not be subjected to undue second-guessing by international tribunals. Tribunals need not be
satisfied that they would have made precisely the same decision as the regulator in order for
them to uphold such decisions. The proposition first enunciated in the Myers case (in the
context of the fair and equitable treatment standard) that international law extends a “high
level of deference to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own
borders” has been adopted in subsequent cases.**° Indeed, in Saluka, that tribunal observed:

.». Even though Article 3 obviously leaves room for judgment and appreciation by
the Tribunal, it does not set out totally subjective standards which would allow the
Tribunal to substitute, with regard to the Czech Republic’s conduct to be assessed

35° The comment made by the tribunal in S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Canada, Partial Award, at para 261, although made in
the course of discussing the fair and equitable treatment standard, is apposite to the circumstances facing the CNB at
the time. The Myers dictum has been quoted with approval in a number of subsequent awards, including Saluka v.

in the present case, its judgment on the choice of solutions for the Czech Republic’s
357

This comment, made in the context of that tribunal’s interpretation of Article 3 is also
applicable to Article 5. The Sa/uka tribunal noted, after it reviewed the CNB’s forced
administration of the bank, that:

The Czech State, in the person of its banking regulator, the CNB, had the
responsibility to take a decision on 16 June 2000. It enjoyed a margin of discretion
in the exercise of that responsibility.** [Emphasis added.]

The Tribunal agrees.

In the Tribunal’s view, the decision to revoke the licence cannot be viewed as an
expropriation. This was not a case where the regulator arbitrarily decided to deprive a licensee
of its licence. To the contrary, the most senior officer of the bank, Mr Vavra, expressly stated
his view on 19 February 2003 that due to its illiquidity, the bank could no longer operate and
that notice was being given pursuant to the statutory provision under which the CNB
subsequently acted. The Tribunal cannot characterize the CNB’s acting in response to such
notice as a breach of Article 5 of the Treaty.

It is true that Union Banka’s Supervisory Board dismissed Messrs Vavra and Truhléf shortly
after they signed the 20 February 2003 letter and it might be suggested that they did not act in
the best interests of the bank. The Tribunal would reject such a contention because the very
difficult circumstances in which the bank was operating, combined with the certainty of a
catastrophic run had it opened its doors on 21 February 2003 after news of the denial of state
aid was publicised, point both to the reasonableness of the opinion expressed by the bank’s
three senior officers and the CNB’s response thereto.

The administrative proceeding to revoke the licence was completed on 18 March 2003. As
noted in the review of the Claimant’s allegations, there were other aspects of the bankruptcy
and liquidation process that were said to breach the Treaty, The Tribunal does not consider that

these allegations, even if made out, would change its determination under Article 5.

Quite apart from the bank’s CEO and senior officers giving formal notice of the bank’s
inability to carry on, the evidence shows that at the point that the revocation proceeding was
initiated, having regard to all the circumstances, there is no question that it had been propped

up and in imminent risk of collapse for some months.

Sil.

During the hearing the Claimant directed the Tribunal’s attention to a letter dated 19 February
2003 to the Minister of Finance (who had solicited Governor Tima’s opinion on the bank’s
standing) in which the Govemor advised that although “there is a danger that the bank may
become insolvent as soon as next week", the “capital adequacy of the bank is currently over

8%” and hence it did not fall below the capital adequacy minimum.*”

This letter was put to Governor Tima during the course of the hearing with counsel pointing
out that the bank was not technically insolvent as of 19 February 2003:

Q. So the bank was not insolvent at this point in time; it had a liquidity problem,
correct? If the bank had been insolvent, I assume you would have told the Ministry.

A. Technically it wasn't insolvent, that is right, but you must take into account that a
part of that, let's say, capital was the receivable against the Czech National Bank,

Q. Lunderstand, Governor Tima, and I understand that was disputed, but in
response to the Minister of Finance's enquiry, you made a note in your letter back to
him, which you did not have to put in your letter if you chose not to or didn't agree
with, that the capital adequacy ratio of the bank was in excess of 8 per cent; correct?

A. That is what I say here.

Q. So the bank was not insolvent.

A. The bank was not technically insolvent.

Q. It had a liquidity problem, at this point in time.

A. Well, I would disagree with this point. The fact that -- once again, it technically
wasn't insolvent; it doesn't mean that the situation is, from the point of view of
solvency, sustainable in the medium term. By the way, it was mentioned also by the
auditor, in the annual report, that without a strategic investor the situation would not

be viable.

It appears from the Govemor’s testimony that whether the bank was technically insolvent or
not as of 19 February 2003 depended upon whether one gave any credence to the BDS
Receivable which had been recorded in Union Banka’s balance sheet in September 2002. This
is an important issue to which the Tribunal now tums.

In a letter to the First Deputy Minister of Finance dated 22 January 2003, Mr Vavra alluded to
the fact that the CNB Receivable had kept the bank from being insolvent throughout the
months leading up to the denial of state aid.*' Mr Vavra sought “a new round of negotiations
... Which would result in a formulation of a revised proposal of a material for discussion

within your Ministry and later even for the discussion by the Government of the Czech

Republic". He indicated that since Invesmart had taken over the bank which “enabled the first
complete complex and sufficiently deep assessment of the bank’s economic situation,” the
results showed the “necessity of significant increase of provisions which cannot be solved only

by a foreign investor’s entry".

Missing funds in the balance, which are for the time being covered by the
receivable against the CNB, which are subject to arbitration proceedings, reached
the amount of 1.7 billion Czech crowns.** [Emphasis added.]
Mr Vavra conceded at the hearing that had the bank de-recognised the receivable at the time
that the CNB had so requested (22 October 2002, coincidentally the same day that Invesmart
filed its third application to acquire indirect control of Union Banka), it would have fallen
below the capital adequacy minimum and its banking licence would have had to be withdrawn.

In cross examination, the following questions were put to Mr Vavra:

Q. So, Mr. Vavra, the former management, as we have discussed, realised because
of the CNB’s inspection that there was a provisioning gap of some 1.8 billion
{CZK]. Essentially, it sued the CNB for that amount and then recorded that claim as
an asset on its books, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. If it hadn’t recorded that asset on its books, it would have been below the capital
adequacy minimum and the bank’s licence would have to be withdrawn. Is that
correct?

ee

A. Sorry. Yes, the answer is yes.*

Mr Vavra’s testimony was confirmed by the Third Restructuring Plan submitted by Euro-
Trend on 12 February 2003, one week before Mr Vavra gave notice to the CNB under Section
26(b) of the Banking Act. The Plan noted that:

If this claim was taken off the balance-sheet at Union banka, a.s., the Bank would
not be able to satisfy the basic ratios set for managing a bank and would have to
cease operating as a bank.**
Likewise, the minutes of a meeting held on 28 January 2003 between 5 and Mr
Racocha of the CNB contain a revealing contemporaneous exchange as to the role of the
“receivable” and what the bank’s true financial condition was. Mr Racocha’s record notes as

In the Tribunal’s view, the CNB was within its rights to demand that a contingency of such
doubtful validity not be recorded in full as an asset on the bank’s balance sheet nor as profit in

its profit and loss account.”

Had that “asset” been removed when first requested, the bank’s real condition would have
been exposed even before the CNB’s approval was given on 24 October 2002 and well before
the deterioration of liquidity that prompted Mr Vavra to seek meetings with the CNB and the
Minister of Finance on 19 February 2003.

In short, the evidence shows overwhelmingly that the bank was in the most serious of financial
straits and the CNB’s decision to accept and act upon Mr Vavra’s oral and subsequent written.
notice of Union Banka’s inability to meet its obligations vis-d-vis its depositors was a bona
fide regulatory measure that does not fall within the scope of Article 5. The measure falls

clearly on the bona fide regulation side of the regulation/expropriation divide.

36 Exhibit R-70, letter dated 22 October 2002 from the CNB to Union Banka, \

Article 3(4) of the BIT provides "Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may
have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party". This
provision, which is commonly described as an "umbrella clause" brings obligations of a host t

State which arise outside the BIT under the protective "umbrella" of the Treaty.

The Claimant refers to a number of cases including Eureko v Poland*”” where the Tribunal
observed that "any' obligations is capacious; it means not only obligations of a certain type,
but 'any’ - that is to say, all-obligations entered into with regard to investments of investors”.

The Claimant relies on this passage for the proposition that an umbrella clause is not confined

to contractual obligations but extends to obligations of any sort.

The Respondent asserts that the Eureko case concemed the assumption of contractual
obligations and that "umbrella clauses" have never been held to mean anything else than that
(at least some) contractual claims might be raised to the level of international investment

claims.

The Respondent further says that the Claimant does not and cannot have a claim under Article
3(4) of the BIT because it does not even plead the existence of an obligation on the part of the
Czech state to grant to it aid. Its case is based on a "legitimate expectation" to receive a grant r

of aid, not an obligation.

3” Eureko, B.V v Republic of Poland, Partial Award, 19 August 2005.

526. The Tribunal is of the opinion that the claim founded on Article 3(4) of the BIT cannot
succeed, Even if the existence of an "umbrella clause" elevates breaches of a contract to
breaches of the BIT, a point on which tribunals before and after Eureko have reached opposite
conclusions, or extends beyond contractual breaches, the Claimant has not established that
there was any firm, unconditional undertaking, whether contractual or not, to provide state aid.
An "obligation" to provide aid would require the establishment of a clear, unconditional
commitment which would specify its essential terms including the amount of aid, the date to
be provided and so on. No such obligation has been proven by the Claimant. An
encouragement by the state to an investor to apply for aid or an expectation by an investor that

aid will be provided is not sufficient by itself to constitute an "obligation" to provide aid.
Concluding comments
Invesmart’s financial capacity

527, A factor of some significance, in the Tribunal's estimation, is the Claimant’s capacity to effect
the transaction which it claims to have been denied the opportunity to consummate. This was
not a case where the investor was fully funded and ready to complete the transaction (even
according to the “three step plan” that Invesmart contended governed the acquisition®”').

Invesmart did not pay off the RPLs it assumed

528. It is common ground that although on 17 November 2002, Invesmart assumed the debts of
certain Union Banka and Union Group shareholders in the aggregate amount of CZK 2.67
billion and payment obligations towards Union Group in the aggregate amount of CZK 330
million as consideration for 22.6 percent of shares in Union Banka and 60 percent of shares of
Union Group, it never paid for the shares.>”*

529. The Claimant argued in this proceeding that it would have paid for them had the Respondent

complied with its commitment to grant state aid. It argued further that with the Respondent

failing to provide the necessary funds, it made no sense for it to pay for the shares.°”>

37! Reply Memorial, para 21: “The Government always understood that the restructuring of Union Banka would
occur in three steps, that the first step would be Invesmart’s assumption of the debts under the DAAs [Debt
Assumption Agreements] and its acquisition of the shares under the SPAs {Share Purchase Agreements], that the
second step would be the Government’s completion of the Foresbank Settlement, and that the third step would be
Invesmart’s repayment of the debts.”

3” Exhibits R-83-R-100, 18 agreements on debt assumption entered into on 17 November 2002.

> Reply Memorial, paras 21 and 34: “With respect to the capital contribution of €90 million for the RPLs, it is true
that once the Czech Republic decided not to honor its commitment to provide state aid, Invesmart decided not to
perform the futile act of injecting €90 million into a bank that the Government had just destroyed. But there is no
rule of international law — jurisdictional or otherwise — that requires an investor to maximize its damages in order to
seek the protection of a BIT.”

530. During the hearing, Mr Vavra was cross-examined as to why Union Banka did not call upon
Invesmart to pay for its shares after the execution of the debt assumption agreements. It was
pointed out that the bank was suffering liquidity problems and the repayment of the RPLs
would have been a welcomed source of new capital.**

dated 13 January 2003, which was put to Mr Vavra, noted that the bank rolled over ten related
375

A document prepared by the CNB,
party loans in December 2002, contrary to a CNB regulation.” Mr Vavra explained his

decision to roll over the loans as follows:

Q. ... The contractual documentation gave Union banka the right to immediate
payment. But for your prolongation, they would have had to pay. That is correct,
isn't it?

A. Correct.

Q. Can I just ask you: your fiduciary duty was to Union banka and not to
Invesmart?

A. Absolutely.

Q. So how could you responsibly have prolonged Invesmart's obligation to pay
liquidity into the bank when the bank desperately needed liquidity?

A. Because I knew if we didn't roll those loans over, Invesmart would not have
repaid those loans, it would have defaulted on those loans.

Q. Because you were aware Invesmart had no money behind it.

A. No, I was aware that Invesmart's conditions for making this money available was
not being met.

Q. Except those conditions aren't reflected in the contractual documents.

A. Correct. But if I may for a minute -- ifI may for a minute just say that asking
Invesmart to repay those loans at that very point in time would just mean end to an
effort of saving Union banka, and we just didn't feel it was in the interest of any
investor.*”°

531. Mr Vavra thus decided not to call upon the Claimant to make payment when it was due. \
Although he did not attribute this to Invesmart’s lack of the necessary funds, the Claimant

The shifting sources of the funds

532.

533.

535.

As has already been seen, Invesmart was obliged to include in its application to acquire control
of Union Banka information as to the provenance of the funds it would use to effect the
acquisition. Invesmart did not have such funds at its disposal during the period leading up to
the CNB’s approval on 24 October 2002. There is some evidence that it initially intended to
borrow the money.°” It then informed the CNB that it would raise the funds by means of a

shareholders’ capital contribution”?

Invesmart’s first formal application for the approval of its indirect acquisition of a controlling
interest in Union Banka, filed on 4 April 2002, did not include the required information and
the application was discontinued on 3 July 2002.” Evidently as a means of providing some
assurance on the matter, by letter dated 25 June 2002, Mr Gert H Rienmiiller of Invesmart
wrote to Viadimir Krejéa, manager of the CNB’s Bank Supervision Section, referring to
previous and di ing the ion of the 's appli
concerning the origin of funds. Mr Rienmiiller informed the CNB that Fortis, a large Benelux

international financial group, “has issued a guarantee for the payment of the price in
accordance with a contract which matures in September and December 2002".**!

This appears to be the first and last reference in the record of this proceeding to any role that
Fortis might play in financing the transaction, including its having issued a guarantee. The
representation evidently did not satisfy the CNB which, on 3 July 2002, discontinued the

 

istrative approval

 

decision on the application.”

Invesmart re-applied for CNB approval on 4 July 2002. Throughout the time that its second
was under ideration, the CNB d further i ion on the source of
the funds to be used to purchase the shareholding interest.°*? The second application was also

rejected for lack of information on the source of the funds.* The Tribunal will revert to this
below.

Invesmart did not comply with the Receivables Assignment Agreement

536.

537.

538.

It will be recalled from the Tribunal’s discussion of the legitimate expectations claim that in
mid-August 2002, Union Banka’s auditors were balking at issuing their report for the bank’s
financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2001. To resolve the auditors’ need for
adequate provisioning of loans in light of concerns expressed by the CNB, Invesmart
concluded the Receivables Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it assumed the troubled
loan portfolio that Union Banka (and Invesmart) hoped to transfer to CF as part of the Fores
transaction. This relieved Union Banka from having to record a provision of CZK 300
million against the loans which it hoped to transfer to CF.

Under Clause 11.5 of the Agreement, Invesmart agreed, as of the Agreement’s execution, to
deliver to Union Banka an irrevocable first demand Bank Guarantee issued by a reputable
bank for the amount of CZK 300 million valid through 15 December 2002. This was to secure
payment of a penalty in the event that Invesmart did not take over the CF Joan portfolio after
being so requested by the bank.

Invesmart did not issue the bank guarantee on 13 August 2002 or at any time thereafter. Mr
Catalfamo conceded that although the Agreement required Invesmart to issue the guarantee, it
did not so do:

A. Yes, this is very much connected to the Ceska Finanéni transactions, and
actually the value of 1.2 billion was exactly the same value that had been negotiated
at the time with CF. And we decided to take this major step because we wanted to
show the commitment of Invesmart to the auditors that we really believed that the
Ceska Finanénf will be concluded and the bank will continue as a going concern.

Q. Paragraph 5, you were supposed to deliver as of this day an irrevocable first
demand bank guarantee issued by reputable bank for the amount of 300 million
Czech crowns, valid through 15th December. That is right, isn't it?

A. Yes.

Q. You didn't do that, did you?

A. No, we didn't."

Thus, although the Receivables Assignment Agreement cleaned up the bank’s finances enough
to secure the issuance of the auditor’s report, a key obligation undertaken by Invesmart in mid-
August 2002 was not performed.**”

Moreover, when the 1 December 2002 deadline for the contemplated assignment of the loan
portfolio to CF passed and Invesmart became liable under the Receivables Assignment
Agreement to pay the CZK 1.2 billion it had agreed to pay, it did not do so.

was also cross examined on this point:
Q. Why didn't you pay in December?
A.AsI said, because we believed that a conclusion of what was the Ceska Finanéni

then — the gc into another ing plan, was
very, very close, and there was no need.

 

Q. This was a private law obligation to Union banka, which was in serious trouble
in December. Why didn't you pay?

A. Because we felt it wasn't needed, because without the State support there would
be--

Q. No UB?

A. There would be no UB, as we said."

A number of wealthy shareholders withdrew from Invesmart

542.

543.

From the outset, Invesmart was held out as an investment company whose shareholders
comprised a number of wealthy and prominent Italian individuals and families. Invesmart
repeatedly adverted to the shareholders’ substantial financial capacity in its dealings with the
Czech authorities.”

One of the representatives of those families, a Mr Ajello (an Invesmart shareholder through
C.GLL, S.r.1 and also a representative of the interests of the Barilla and Ricci families) joined
and Mr Rienmiiller in meeting with CNB representatives on 12 September
2002. At this meeting, CNB officials continued to press for further details on the
documentation for proof of the source of the funds that was to be submitted with the second
application. They noted that the end of the three month approval period was nearing and if the

documents were not provided, the administrative proceeding would likely be terminated with a

negative decision. The minutes record the CNB observing that:

... proving financial capacity of Invesmart B.V. to realize the transaction and to
remove problems of Union banka (particularly paying loans granted to shareholders
and persons related to Union Group) is a key feature for CNB to assess the
application”!

544. The minutes further record Invesmart’s position that it did not expect that “the investors would
deposit funds with a foreign bank and prove thereby the origin of finds and their actual amount
until the final decision is made with respect to the transaction realization". Invesmart’s
priority was to decide whether to continue with the transaction, but it would “assess another

possible method to prove the financial capacity".*”

545. testified that:

[t]he reason why Mr. Ajello was there and participated in the meeting was for them
to understand better what was the status of the Union banka transactions ... [and]
we met some of the representatives of the supervisory departments. The reception
was not very good, and Mr. Ajello was a little bit surprised that -- not to find the
same kind of attitude that I had represented, which was that we were working
entirely with the governments.°”?

546. The meeting’s significance lies in the fact that the shareholders represented by Mr Ajello
decided not to participate further in Invesmart. Indeed, at the very meeting at which
Invesmart’s shareholders approved the capital increase, some of its shareholders (such as the
Barilla family) either abstained from voting on the increase or were unrepresented at the
meeting and moreover had decided to sell their shares to and thus withdraw

from the company.?*

decided to complete the acquisition of up to 95 percent of Union Group subject to the
resolution of certain matters such as the conclusion of a satisfactory transaction with CF.°%°

He noted further that the complexity and “inreliability” (sic) of the project made it impossible
for Invesmart to obtain third party financing and that therefore the Union Group acquisition
“will be therefore entirely covered by Invesmart with its own asset.” Board and shareholders’
meetings had been called (he attached the notices convening the two meetings on Invesmart
letterhead) for 24 September 2002 and 16 October 2002, respectively, “to increase the capital
of the company of additional €90 million".?**

The letter went on to describe some of Invesmart’s shareholders, which

described as having “a strong and solid financial weight and reputation". They included the
previously mentioned Barilla and Ricci families and others.”

Invesmart’s 16 September 2002 letter evidently did not provide sufficient comfort to the CNB
as to the source of the funds and consequently on 4 October 2002, for the second time, the
CNB denied Invesmart’s application to acquire control of Union Banka.** This set the stage
for Invesmart’s third application, filed on 22 October 2002 and leading up to that, the holding
of the shareholders meeting on 16 October 2002 at which the €90 million capital increase was
approved.

At the 16 October 2002 shareholders’ meeting ini: by i in Rotterdam, the
only shareholders voting in favour of the resolution to increase the share capital of the
company by €90 million by way of share premium were and de Sury (the
holder of a very small interest). Apparently unbeknownst to the CNB (which had been advised
in a previous communication that he owned 21 percent of Invesmart’s shares*)

Barilla family, had decided to exit the company. At Invesmart’s 4 November 2002

certain other decisions, resolutions were passed to either approve the sale or permit the sale of

capacity to raise the majority of the €90 million capital increase was
doubtful

552. The exit of wealthy investors who decided not to participate in Invesmart suggests that
experienced investors did not see the upside potential of the Union Banka deal being pursued
by . The timing of their decision also warrants note: global financial markets
declined after the events of 11 September 2001 and Invesmart’s other investment funds were
destined to be wound up. In fact, the decision to do so was also taken at the 4 November 2002

shareholders' meeting.*”'

, could have paid for their shares of the €90 million capital increase.
testified that he had his own means to make a contribution, but that he was also counting on his
family to come up with the necessary funds.“ Other than testimony there is
no record evidence that shows that his family was prepared to contribute the significant funds
owed to Union Banka pursuant to the debt assumption and share purchase agreements.

554. While there is no doubt as to enthusiasm for the acquisition and profitable
onward sale of Union Banka, having regard to all of the circumstances (particularly
Invesmart’s failure to issue the CZK 300 million bank guarantee on 13 August 2002 which had
led the bank’s auditors to issue the audited financial statements for the year ending 31
December 2001), the Tribunal does not consider his hope of familial financial support to be
sufficient proof of his ability to finance his majority share of the €90 million needed to
complete the deal. There is no indication that at any time after 4 November 2002 any

shareholder made its respective contributions so as to enable the company to pay off the RPLs.

555. It also warrants noting that no claim for costs thrown away in the pursuit of the Union Banka

was in this p ding. Indeed, such evid as has been adduced shows

 

that Invesmart used its control of the bank to authorise payment to it of the costs of its due
diligence in acquiring control of the bank and that at least CZK 35 million of the CZK 65
million authorised by Union Banka’s shareholders after Invesmart acquired control was paid

out to it.“ No evidence was adduced of the costs incurred in pursuing the investment,

although in closing submissions, counsel for the Claimant noted that Invesmart had spent close
to two years trying to effect the transaction.‘

The Tribunal views from Invesmart's: (i) lax due diligence; (ii) uncertain financial means; (iii)
reliance upon the means of wealthy Italian shareholders who were about to sell their shares to
495. (iv) failure to ensure that the various legal agreements it signed accorded
with the conditions that it says governed its acquisition of control of the bank; and (v) failure
to either issue the bank guarantee on 13 August 2002 or to pay the consideration for the
Receivables Assignment Agreement when it came due in December 2002, collectively to be
indicative of the Claimant’s approach to the investment opportunity. This was, in the
Tribunal’s view, to take a “flyer” at gaining ownership of the bank with the assistance of state

aid and then sell it at a quick profit.

It likewise appears to the Tribunal that recognising that Union Banka was in serious peril, the
CNB erred in agreeing to treat with Invesmart. The CNB knew that Invesmart was a new
company with no experience in running a bank. In response to the Chairman’s question as to
why the CNB approved the acquisition in such circumstances, Governor Tima testified that:

... in the end we believed they would be able to deliver that money. They
committed themselves. It means -- generally speaking, it's not an easy decision to
close the bank. So that you look for chances how to avoid that. You look for
potential mergers and so on.*
The evidence is that no Western bank would touch Union Banka In its current condition and
the testimony was that Invesmart was the bank’s only chance. Governor Tima testified that “in
the end we decided to try it. So it was a chance and we didn't want to kill it". He stated further
that this was a mistake.“”” The Tribunal agrees.

The CNB’s willingness to treat with Invesmart goes however to the issue of an award of costs.
It is the Tribunal’s view that although the claims have been rejected, the CNB bears some
responsibility for the bringing of this international proceeding.

costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However the Arbitral
Tribunal may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is

reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.

With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance, Article 40(2) provides that the
Arbitral Tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine
which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it

determines that apportionment is reasonable.

Thus the general rule under the UNCITRAL Rules that the unsuccessful party shall bear the
costs of arbitration does not apply with respect to that portion of the costs of arbitration which
comprise the costs of legal representation and assistance. In both instances, however, the
Tribunal possesses a discretion. With respect to the costs of arbitration (excluding costs of
legal representation and assistance) the unsuccessful party bears the costs but subject to the
Tribunal's discretion to apportion such costs taking into account the circumstances of the case.
With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance the Tribunal decides which
party shall bear such costs or whether the costs should be apportioned.

submissions

The Respondent submits that the general rule as to the costs of arbitration (excluding costs of
legal representation and assistance) referred to in Article 40(1) should apply. Hence it says that
the prevailing party should be reimbursed for all non-legal costs. The Respondent further states
that this rule has been widely followed by arbitral tribunals in recent investment arbitrations
conducted under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and is consistent with Czech practice.

As to the costs of legal representation and assistance, the Respondent says that the success of a
party in the dispute is a determining factor as recent decisions in investment treaty arbitrations
have confirmed.

The Claimant also submits that the successful party should be awarded costs including costs of
legal representation and assistance,

The Tribunal has already referred to Article 40(1) and (2) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules. The general rule as to the costs of arbitration (excluding costs of legal representation
and assistance) is that they shall be borne by the unsuccessful party. While no general rule is
stated with respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance the Tribunal agrees with
the parties' submissions that such costs are also often awarded to the successful party and are
therefore bome by the unsuccessful party.

However it is abundantly clear that under Article 40 the Tribunal possesses a discretion as to
the awarding of costs and their allocation. The concluding words of Article 40(1) require the
Tribunal to take into account "the circumstances of the case". Thus decisions of other tribunals
in previous cases concerning the awarding of costs are not determinative and do not establish a
precedent. They are merely illustrative of the application of Article 40 to the case at hand. In
this case the successful party is the Respondent. However upon careful reflection, the Tribunal
has concluded that there are special circumstances which make it inappropriate to award the
Respondent costs.

In the first place the Respondent applied for an order for security for costs which was
unsuccessful. This is a relevant factor although the Tribunal acknowledges that the costs
incurred in connection with the application comprise only a small percentage of the total costs
of arbitration.

A much more significant factor concerns the facts established by the Tribunal.

The Claimant is a company with extremely limited financial resources and little or no
experience or expertise in banking. It was a most unlikely and perhaps inappropriate entity to
acquire and manage what had been, at one time, a significant bank within the Czech Republic.
And yet it received permission from the CNB to acquire the shares in Union Banka. It is true
that the Claimant intended to on-sell Union Banka, after restructuring it, but even an
acquisition for a limited time or purpose appears inappropriate, having regard to the financial
resources and expertise of the Claimant.

At the hearing Mr Tima, who was the Chairman of the CNB at the time the share acquisition
was approved, was called to give evidence. Claimant's counsel asked Mr Tima what he meant

when he said in his witness statement that Invesmart was not a substantial company. Mr Tima

answered:

I think that I already mentioned that today. It means Invesmart was not any
Deutsche Bank of Société Générale or other well-known bank, so it was, let's say,
no name in the banking sector, having no expertise in running the bank, and no
experience in that respect. That is why, as I explained already, the procedure and
the procedure for providing licence is -- would differ probably from ooking at
Deutsche or some other bank. So it is not -- that is one point.

Secondly, it wasn't a wealthy investor. So that I can imagine there are financial
investors, so this was some kind of a financial investor, but it wasn't -- we didn't see
at that time, at the beginning, enough money behind it. So that i is why it was ver
it was one of the crucial issues during that licence procedure.

The Chairman of the Tribunal then asked Mr Tima why he had approved the acquisition to

which he responded:

Because in the end we believed they would be able to deliver that money. They
committed themselves. It means -- generally speaking, it's not an easy decision to
close the bank. So that you look for chances how to avoid that. You look for
potential mergers and so on. So there was an investor, and I believed at that time, I
trust, that was a fair and honest person. Unfortunately it was my
biggest mistake, probably and -- but in the end we believed that that commitment by
the shareholders meeting was fair and that Invesmart would be able to deliver the
money. So -- but we are speaking about that wasn't a substantial company, so
explaining that at the time this was -- I am just saying this was a crucial issue, but in
the end we decided to try it. So it was a chance and we didn't want to kill it”
Having acquired Union Banka, the Claimant pressed its application for state assistance and
argued in this arbitration that the CNB's approval of the share acquisition led it to believe that

state aid would be granted.

Although this Tribunal has held that there was no breach of the BIT, the actions of the Czech

and in particular the CNB in approving the share isition, were perhaps

unfortunate or unwise.

In these circumstances the Tribunal, although unable to find that there was a breach of the BIT,
considers that the Respondent should not recover any of the costs of arbitration which it has
incurred and that the costs of arbitration should be allocated between the parties in accordance
with the amounts they have paid or the costs incurred.

Accordingly the Tribunal makes no order concerning the costs of arbitration.
