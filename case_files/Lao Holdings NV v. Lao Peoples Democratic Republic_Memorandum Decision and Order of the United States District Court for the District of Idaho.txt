JOHN K. BALDWIN; BRIDGE JURISDICTIONAL DISCOVERY

CAPITAL, LLC; COLEMAN LLC;
and CAMPBELL HOLDINGS LLC,

Defendants.

 

I. INTRODUCTION
Before the Court is Plaintiff The Government of the Lao People’s Democratic
Republic’s (“Lao PDR”) motion for jurisdictional discovery. See Pl.’s Mot. for

Jurisdictional Disc., Aug. 5, 2021, ECF No. 120 (“Pl. Mot.”); see also Am. Memo. in

 

Supp. of Pl.’s Mot. for Jurisdictional Disc., Aug. 5, 2021, ECF No. 123 (“Rev. Pl. Br.”).
Lao PDR requests discovery of six categories of documents and a non-party
deposition, which it claims will establish (1) specific jurisdiction over Defendants
John K. Baldwin (“Baldwin”) and Bridge Capital, LLC (“Bridge”); (2) quasi in rem
jurisdiction over Baldwin and Bridge; and (3) Baldwin’s status as the alter ego of non-

parties Sanum Investments Limited, a Macau limited company (“Sanum”) and Lao

Holdings, N.V., a public limited company incorporated in Aruba (“LHNV”).! See Decl.
of Robert K. Kry, Ex. C, Aug. 5, 2021, ECF No. 120-2 (“Discovery Demands’).
Defendants Baldwin and Bridge oppose the motion on the grounds that (i) the
proposed discovery could not lead to any facts that would establish specific
jurisdiction; (ii) Lao PDR cannot establish quasi in rem jurisdiction as a matter of
law; (iii) non-party discovery is irrelevant to Lao PDR’s jurisdictional claims over
Baldwin and Bridge; and (iv) Lao PDR’s requests are vague, overly broad, and unduly
burdensome. See generally Resp. to [Pl. Mot.], Sept. 21, 2021, ECF No. 128 (“Def.
Br.”). For the following reasons, Lao PDR’s motion is granted in part and denied in
part.2
IL. BACKGROUND

A. Factual Background

Lao PDR and various Baldwin-connected entities have a long history related
to gambling ventures in Laos. See Third Am. Compl., {|| 77-79, July 16, 2021, ECF
No. 108 (“TAC”). A dispute arose between Lao PDR and two of those entities, Sanum
and LHNV. See id. §j 82-84, 88-91. Lao PDR obtained arbitral awards against

Sanum and LHNV in 2017 (the “Awards”), and there have been various legal

1 Lao PDR alleges that discovery might lead to a finding of general jurisdiction over
Baldwin and Bridge; however, Lao PDR’s allegation of possible general jurisdiction is
speculative. See Rev. Pl. Br. at 6.

2 Because the Court is granting the motion in part, the Court will reserve its decision
on the pending Motion to Dismiss the Third Amended Complaint, see ECF No. 121,
until after jurisdictional discovery has been completed and the parties submit
supplemental briefing on the significance of the materials produced in accordance
with the Court’s order.

proceedings to enforce or set aside those Awards, including this action. See id. 4 122,
Exs. C and D; see also Def. Br. at 3 n.2.

Sanum and LHNV commenced arbitrations under bilateral investment
treaties between China and Laos and the Netherlands and Laos, respectively. See
TAC, Exs. C and D. Sanum and LHNV asserted that Lao PDR violated its treaty
obligations by dealing unfairly with the companies and unlawfully and without
compensation expropriating their property in connection with the gaming ventures
Sanum and LHNV were jointly operating with a Laotian company, ST Holdings, in
Laos. See id. Ex. C at 4] 1-2, 65-75, Ex. D at 4 1-2, 63-73. After initially asserting
counterclaims, Lao PDR abandoned those claims and defended the arbitrations by
asserting various alleged crimes and bad faith actions taken by Sanum and LHNV.

Id. Ex. C §j 88-95, Ex. D 86-93; see also Memo. in Supp. of Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss

 

for Failure to State a Claim, 3, May 4, 2021, ECF No. 57-1. Both arbitral tribunals
found that Lao PDR did not violate its treaty obligations in its dealings with Sanum
and LHNV, respectively, and awarded costs, fees, and expenses to Lao PDR totaling
$3,727,358.98. TAC Ex. C J§ 281-94, Ex. D § 251-66.

Lao PDR alleges that it should be permitted to enforce the Awards against
Baldwin and Bridge because various entities, including Sanum, LHNV, Bridge, and
defendants Coleman LLC and Campbell Holdings LLC, are nothing more than
Baldwin’s alter egos. See TAC {/{| 18, 124-202, 238-52. Baldwin and Bridge assert
that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over them and therefore cannot make any

determination regarding their alter ego status. See Memo. in Supp. of [Baldwin and

6-7, Aug. 5, 2021, ECF No. 121-1 (“Def. Br. Mot. to Dismiss TAC”)

B. Procedural Background

The procedural history of this case is long and convoluted, so only the history
relevant to the current motion is discussed. Lao PDR commenced this action by filing
a summons and complaint on April 21, 2020. See Compl., Apr. 21, 2020, ECF No. 1.
Lao PDR’s initial complaint alleged a single cause of action—to enforce the Awards—
against Baldwin and Bridge. Id. {4 148-62. On July 16, 2020, before Baldwin had
been served with a summons, Bridge filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack
of personal jurisdiction on the grounds that Lao PDR had named and served the
incorrect company “Bridge Capital, LLC.” See Def. [Bridge’s] Mot. to Dismiss, July
16, 2020, ECF No. 21 (“First Mot. to Dismiss”). In response, Lao PDR moved to amend
its complaint to include the correct company “Bridge Capital, LLC,” opposed the First
Mot. to Dismiss on the grounds that it should be permitted to conduct jurisdictional
discovery to establish personal jurisdiction, and simultaneously moved to conduct
jurisdictional discovery. See Mot. to Am. Compl., Aug. 31, 2020, ECF No. 26; Mot. to
Conduct Jurisdictional Disc., Aug. 31, 2020, ECF No. 27; Pl.’s Resp. to [Bridge’s] Mot.
to Dismiss, Aug. 31, 2020, ECF No. 28. Bridge opposed Lao PDR’s motions to amend
the complaint and for jurisdictional discovery. See Resp. to Pl.’s Mot. to Conduct
Jurisdictional Disc., Sept. 21, 2020, ECF No. 32; Resp. to Pl.’s Mot. to Am. Compl.,

Case 2:20-cv-00195-CRK Document 137 Filed 11/19/21 Page 5 of 23

On October 1, 2020, Baldwin moved to dismiss the initial complaint for lack of
personal jurisdiction. See [Baldwin’s] Mot. to Dismiss, Oct. 1, 2020, ECF No. 34.
After the parties entered into multiple stipulations to align the briefing schedules of
the various pending motions, see ECF Nos. 35, 36, 39, and 40, the motions were all
fully briefed as of December 11, 2020. See Pl.’s Resp. to [Baldwin’s] Mot. to Dismiss
[Dkt. 34]; Pl.’s Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Am. Compl. [Dkt. 26]; AND Pl.’s Reply in
Supp. of Mot. to Conduct Jurisdictional Disc. [Dkt. 27], Oct. 22, 2020, ECF No. 37;
Reply in Supp. of [Baldwin’s] Mot. to Dismiss [Dkt. 34], Dec. 11, 2020, ECF No. 41.
The Court then ordered oral argument of the various pending motions to be conducted
on March 15, 2021. See Order, Dec. 18, 2020, ECF No. 42; Ltr. Re Oral Arg.
Questions, Feb. 19, 2021, ECF No. 43; Amended Order, March 2, 2021, ECF No. 44.

However, on March 5, 2021, Lao PDR filed a second motion to amend its
complaint to (1) include a cause of action under the Uniform Voidable Transactions
Act; (2) add Coleman, LLC as a party; and (8) add additional allegations in support
of its argument that the Court has personal jurisdiction over the defendants. See
Second Mot. to Am. Compl., March 5, 2021, ECF No. 45. The Court conducted oral
argument on March 15, 2021, see Oral Argument, March 15, 2021, ECF No. 46, after
which the parties entered into a stipulated schedule pursuant to which Lao PDR
would file its Second Proposed Amended Complaint and the parties would brief their
renewed motions to dismiss and for jurisdictional discovery, respectively. See

Stipulation, March 18, 2021, ECF No. 49; see also Scheduling Order, March 18, 2021,

 

ECF No. 50.

On March 19, 2021, Lao PDR filed its Second Amended Complaint and the
Court granted Lao PDR’s unopposed second motion to amend its complaint. See
Second Am. Compl., March 19, 2021, ECF No. 52; Order, March 19, 2021, ECF No.
53. Subsequently, Baldwin and Bridge filed a new motion to dismiss for lack of
personal jurisdiction. See [Baldwin and Bridge’s] Mot. to Dismiss for Lack of
Jurisdiction or for Improper Venue, May 4, 2021, ECF No. 56. On May 21, 2021, Lao
PDR moved to amend its complaint to add a new defendant and a new claim, and for
leave to file a third amended complaint. See Third Mot. to Am. Compl., May 21, 2021,
ECF No. 59. Lao PDR also filed opposition to Baldwin and Bridge’s motion to dismiss.
See Pl.’s Resp. to Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction or Improper
Venue, May 25, 2021, ECF No. 65.

The Court subsequently denied Baldwin and Bridge’s motion to dismiss the
Second Amended Complaint as moot. See Am. Scheduling Order, July 27, 2021, ECF
No. 113. Pursuant to various stipulations and amendments to the Court’s scheduling
order, the parties briefed new motions to dismiss and for jurisdictional discovery
related to the TAC. See Pl.’s Mot.; Defs. Baldwin and Bridge’s Mot. to Dismiss [TAC]
for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction or Improper Venue, Aug. 5, 2021, ECF No. 121

Sept. 15, 2021, ECF No. 126; Def. Br. The Court conducted oral argument on Pl. Mot.
and the Mot. to Dismiss TAC on October 28, 2021 (“Oral Arg.”). See Docket Entry,
Oct. 28, 2021, ECF No. 135.

After initially propounding discovery requests to defendants and receiving
written objections, Lao PDR revised its requests to three categories broken down into
seven separate requests consisting of six document requests and one request for a
deposition, which it now asks the Court to order. See Discovery Demands. The
specific discovery Lao PDR requests in support of its jurisdictional claims are:

A. Idaho Independent Bank Account Information

(1) Account statements from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2019 for
all accounts at Idaho Independent Bank owned by Baldwin, Bridge,

Sanum, LHNV, or the John K. Baldwin Irrevocable Trust, or for
which Baldwin has signing authority, including without limitation

4 The TAC was deemed filed as of May 21, 2021. See TAC Order at 20.

the accounts identified in ECF No. 31-1 Exs. 3-4 and ECF No. 37-1
Exs. C—J.

(2) All communications between Baldwin and Idaho Independent Bank

ownership or other property interest, from January 1, 2017 to the
present (including any interest in an LLC or other entity organized
under the laws of Idaho or with its principal place of business in
Idaho), and any acquisitions or dispositions of such property during
that period.

(4) For any such property that is an interest in an LLC or other entity,
the organizational documents for the entity or other documents
showing the entity’s ownership and any changes in ownership during
that period.

(5) The organizational and trust documents for the John K. Baldwin
Irrevocable Trust, including documents sufficient to show the
settlors, beneficiaries, and trustees thereof.

documents regardless of the date, as well as corporate resolutions,
board meeting minutes and agendas, financial statements, and tax

returns from January 1, 2012 to the present.

production is complete.

For the reasons set forth below, Lao PDR’s motion for jurisdictional discovery

is granted in part and denied in part.

Ill. DISCUSSION
A. Standard of Review
Ordering—or not ordering—jurisdictional discovery is within the discretion of
the Court. Boschetto v. Hansing, 539 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9'» Cir. 2008). In the Ninth
Circuit, jurisdictional discovery is appropriate where “pertinent facts bearing on the
question of jurisdiction are controverted or where a more satisfactory showing of the
facts is necessary.” Laub v. U.S. Dep't of Interior, 342 F. 3d 1080, 1093 (9t Cir. 2003)

(quoting Butcher’s Union Local No. 498 v. SDC Inv., Inc., 788 F.2d 535, 540 (9th Cir.

 

1986)). Courts will deny jurisdictional discovery where the request is “based on little
more than a hunch that it might yield jurisdictionally relevant facts” or “based on
bare allegations in the face of specific denials.” Boschetto, 539 F.3d at 1020; Terracom
v. Valley Nat'l Bank, 49 F.3d 555, 562 (9t» Cir. 1995) (citation omitted). Although not
binding on this Court, some district courts in the Ninth Circuit

have required a plaintiff to establish a “colorable basis” for personal

jurisdiction before discovery is ordered. This ‘colorable’ showing should

be understood as something less than a prima facie showing, and could

be equated as requiring the plaintiff to come forward with “some

evidence” tending to establish personal jurisdiction over the defendant.

WL 12132068, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 13, 2013) (quoting Johnson v. Mitchell, No. CIV.

cases); see also Lone Wolf Distributors, Inc. v. Bravoware, Inc., No. 2:15-cv-00016-

 

BLW, 2016 WL 707359, at *1—2 (D. Idaho Feb. 22, 2016) (allowing discovery because
plaintiff had “at least a colorable claim that discovery might yield facts sufficient to

establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction”).

Case 2:20-cv-00195-CRK Document 137 Filed 11/19/21 Page 10 of 23

B. Proposed Discovery in Support of Specific Jurisdiction

Lao PDR asserts that discovery into the first category of discovery, “Idaho
Independent Bank Account Information,” is appropriate because “it would confirm
whether Baldwin and Bridge purposefully used Idaho bank accounts to finance and
operate the unlawful gambling ventures in Laos that gave rise to the arbitrations and
pay for the arbitrations themselves,” and therefore would allegedly establish specific
jurisdiction over Baldwin and Bridge. Rev. Pl. Br. at 3. Specifically, Lao PDR
contends that the discovery it seeks is narrowly tailored and will reveal connections
between Baldwin and Bridge’s activities in Idaho and the events underlying the two
arbitrations. Id. at 4-6. In support of its argument, Lao PDR points to allegations in
the TAC that Baldwin and Bridge used their Idaho bank accounts in connection with
Sanum and LHNV’s Laotian gambling ventures. Id. at 4—5; see also TAC {jj 33-62.
Lao PDR lists several transactions that it argues show a pattern by Baldwin and
Bridge of using Idaho bank accounts to conduct business related to Sanum and
LHNV’s gambling businesses. Rev. Pl. Br. at 5; see also Decl. of David Branson in
Supp. of Pl.’s Resp. to [Baldwin’s] Mot. to Dismiss, {/] 29-38, Exs. C—J, Oct. 22, 2020,
ECF No. 37-1 (“Branson Decl.”).

In response, Baldwin and Bridge contend that discovery is not warranted
because (i) banking records of non-parties are not relevant to the question of specific
jurisdiction over Baldwin and Bridge; (ii) Baldwin and Bridge’s Idaho contacts must
relate to the Awards, not the issues underlying the arbitrations, so discovery into
their Idaho contacts is futile; (iii) even if Lao PDR is correct that the forum contacts

need only relate to the issues underlying the arbitrations, Lao PDR still could not

MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER - 10

Case 2:20-cv-00195-CRK Document 137 Filed 11/19/21 Page 11 of 23

demonstrate specific jurisdiction because it cannot show that its injury—i.e. the costs
it incurred defending the arbitrations—are related to Baldwin and Bridge’s contacts
with Idaho; and (iv) the specific requests LAO PDR propounded are overly broad and
unduly burdensome to comply with. See Def. Br. at 3-6.

Instead of a bright-line rule about whether the relevant forum contacts must
relate to the events underlying the arbitration or to the conduct of the arbitration
itself that is applicable to arbitral award enforcement actions, the case law
demonstrates that courts look to the nexus between a defendant, the forum, and the
plaintiffs claim. Compare Rey. Pl. Br. at 4 (citing Compafiia_de Inversiones
Mercantiles, S.A. v. Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua S.A.B. de C.V., 970 F.3d 1269,
1287 (10 Cir. 2020); Glencore Grain Rotterdam B.V. v. Shivnath Rai Harnarain Co.,

284 F.3d 1114, 1123-24 (9t Cir. 2002)) with Def. Br. at 3-4 (citing Sharp Corp. v.

 

Hisense USA Corp., 292 F. Supp. 3d 157, 163-64, 171 (D.D.C. Nov. 18, 2017); CRS,
LLC v. Bitarts Ltd., No. 05-0437L, 2005 WL 8172582, at *2 (W.D. Wash. July 26,
2005); CIMSA, 970 F.3d at 1286). In Sharp, the court analyzed the connection
between the defendant’s contacts with the forum and the arbitral tribunal’s
emergency order enjoining the plaintiff from making disparaging remarks about the
defendant. 292 F. Supp. 3d at 170-71. The plaintiff complained that the emergency
order allegedly infringed plaintiffs first amendment rights, so the court’s analysis
necessarily looked to the relationship between the defendant’s forum contacts and the
emergency order enjoining those rights. Id. Likewise, in Glencore Grain, the Ninth

Circuit discussed the claims underlying the arbitration because the plaintiff in that

MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER - 11

Case 2:20-cv-00195-CRK Document 137 Filed 11/19/21 Page 12 of 23

case sought to enforce a final arbitral award for damages against the defendant. See
Glencore Grain, 284 F.3d at 1123-24.

Lao PDR argues that CIMSA creates a bright-line rule that the appropriate
inquiry is into the nexus to the claims underlying the arbitration. Rev. Pl. Br. at 4.
In support of that argument, Lao PDR cites the Tenth Circuit’s statement in CIMSA
that the

substantive and procedural features of an action to confirm an

arbitration award support the conclusion that the proper jurisdictional

inquiry is whether the beneficiary of an award can show he or she
sustained an injury caused by the defendant’s forum activities in
connection with the claim that led to the arbitration, as opposed to an
injury caused by the defendant’s forum activities in connection with the
arbitration proceeding itself.
970 F.3d at 1287; see also Rev. Pl. Br. at 4. Thus, according to Lao PDR, the Tenth
Circuit held that specific jurisdiction exists as long as defendant’s forum contacts
relate to the events underlying the arbitration.

However, the CIMSA court also set forth the constitutional analysis when
specific jurisdiction is contested.

Consistent with the Due Process Clause, a court may exercise specific

personal jurisdiction only if the litigation results from alleged injuries

that arise out of or relate to activities by the defendant which were

purposefully directed at the forum. In a case like this one, this guidance

makes more sense—and perhaps only makes sense—if applied with an

eye toward the underlying dispute.

970 F.3d at 1286 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citations
omitted). Thus, the language Lao PDR relies on, which relates specifically to

jurisdictional features of the New York Convention, must be read together with the

Tenth Circuit’s construction of the proper constitutional inquiry that a court must

MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER - 12

Case 2:20-cv-00195-CRK Document 137 Filed 11/19/21 Page 13 of 23

make to satisfy due process. Therefore, the Tenth Circuit held that in a typical
enforcement action (i.e., one in which an arbitral claimant seeks to enforce an award
of damages against an arbitral respondent), the injury in question occurred prior to
the arbitral proceedings and so the relevant constitutional inquiry is whether the
defendant’s forum contacts relate to the underlying claims in the arbitration. Id. at
1286-87. CIMSA does not address the specific jurisdictional analysis in contexts
other than the typical enforcement action, such as the one presented here, except to
the extent that it held that the constitutional framework remains the same. Id. at
1286. Thus, CIMSA, Sharp, and Glencore Grain all look at the relationship between
the plaintiff's claim and the defendant’s forum contacts.

Given that the Court finds no real conflict in the authorities cited by the
parties, the proper inquiry is whether a sufficient nexus exists between the forum,
the defendant, and the plaintiffs cause of action. In this case, Lao PDR’s claim is to
enforce two arbitral Awards for the costs, fees, and expenses it incurred in defending
the arbitrations commenced by Sanum and LHNV. See TAC 4{ 119-20. The arbitral
tribunals each found that Lao PDR had a complete defense to the claims asserted by
Sanum and LHNYV, respectively, and, pursuant to the procedures agreed to by the
parties to the arbitrations, the tribunals awarded Lao PDR costs, fees, and expenses
for having to defend against Sanum’s and LHNV’s unsuccessful claims. See TAC Ex
C44 281-94, Ex. D 4 251-66.

Although the Awards are not for damages based on Lao PDR’s affirmative
claims during the arbitrations, Lao PDR demonstrated a sufficient connection

between the Awards and the claims underlying the arbitrations for the purposes of

MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER - 13

Case 2:20-cv-00195-CRK Document 137 Filed 11/19/21 Page 14 of 23

this motion in that Lao PDR was awarded its costs, fees, and expenses based on the
merits of its defenses.> Moreover, Lao PDR has submitted sufficient evidence to make
its allegations regarding the nexus between Baldwin, Bridge, Idaho, and Lao PDR’s
claim to enforce the Awards more than a hunch. Lao PDR proffered evidence of
contacts with Idaho that relate to the conduct of the arbitrations themselves. Lao
PDR submitted an email confirmation of an outgoing wire transfer of $200,000 that
was sent from a Bridge account in Idaho to the International Bank for Reconstruction
in connection with the LHNV arbitration. See Branson Decl. § 37, Ex. I. Moreover,
Lao PDR alleges that Baldwin used an Idaho bank account to bribe a potential
witness to not testify in the arbitral proceedings. See TAC § 54. Although the specific
allegation that Baldwin’s Idaho account was used to pay the bribe is made on
information and belief, the fact that the arbitral tribunals found that such a bribe
was paid supports the allegation as more than hunch. See TAC Ex. C 4 154-62, Ex.
D ¥/§/ 153-61. Additionally, Lao PDR submitted evidence of a number of financial
transactions linking Idaho to Baldwin and Bridge’s activities in Laos. See Branson
Decl. § 29-38, Exs. C—J. Although some of these transactions involve non-parties

rather than Baldwin or Bridge, Lao PDR has done enough at this stage to warrant

5 Given that Lao PDR’s claim is to enforce Awards for costs, fees, and expenses
incurred during the arbitrations themselves, the Court is mindful of the analysis set
forth in Sharp. In Sharp, plaintiff sought to set aside an emergency award issued by
the tribunal. Sharp, 292 F. Supp. 3d at 163-64. In assessing jurisdiction, the court
refused to consider contacts relating to the underlying dispute because the
“grievances are grounded in the emergency order itself.” 292 F. Supp. 3d at 171.
Here, unlike the emergency award in Sharp, which was an interim measure put in
place during the pendency of the merits proceedings, the Awards reflect Lao PDR’s
success on the merits of its defenses.

MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER - 14

Case 2:20-cv-00195-CRK Document 137 Filed 11/19/21 Page 15 of 23

limited discovery into Baldwin’s and Bridge’s contacts with Idaho and how those
contacts relate to the Awards.

However, the Court agrees with Baldwin and Bridge that Lao PDR’s first
category of requested discovery is overbroad. Lao PDR seeks eight years of account
statements for “all accounts at Idaho Independent Bank owned by Baldwin, Bridge,
Sanum, [LHNV], or the John K. Baldwin Irrevocable Trust, or for which Baldwin has
signing authority.”6 Discovery Demands at 1. The Court remains unpersuaded that
non-parties’ activities in the forum have any bearing on the Court’s jurisdiction over
Baldwin and Bridge.’ Jurisdictional discovery into the John K. Baldwin Irrevocable
Trust (the “JKB Trust”) is particularly unwarranted, as there is not even an

allegation that the JKB Trust is Baldwin’s alter ego. Moreover, as discussed below,

6 For the purposes of this motion, Lao PDR need not make a prima facie showing of
specific jurisdiction over Baldwin and Bridge. Lao PDR has met its lesser burden to
show “a colorable basis” of personal jurisdiction based on Baldwin and Bridge’s
contacts with Idaho related to both the conduct of the arbitrations and the claims
underlying the arbitrations. See Lone Wolf, 2016 WL 707359, at *1. Therefore, the
requested time period is not overbroad. See Steel v. United States, 813 F.2d 1545,
1549 (9t» Cir. 1987) (“courts must examine the defendant’s contacts with the forum
at the time of the events underlying the dispute when determining whether they have
jurisdiction”).

7 Lao PDR contended at oral argument that Baldwin’s activities as a corporate officer,
director, or trustee of various non-party entities could be imputed to Baldwin
personally for the purposes of specific jurisdiction without a finding that Baldwin and
those entities are alter egos. Oral Arg. at 23:24—25:30. Lao PDR’s contention is
incorrect. See In re Boon Global Ltd., 923 F.3d 648, 651 (9'» Cir. 2019) (other than
alter ego status and individual torts, corporate form generally shields officers from
jurisdiction where the only contacts are with regard to performance of official duties).

the Court must have jurisdiction over Baldwin in order to reach the substantive
question of which, if any, of his companies are merely his alter egos.

Therefore, the Court will limit Lao PDR’s inquiry to accounts owned by
Baldwin and/or Bridge. Lao PDR’s request for account statements for accounts owned
by Sanum, LHNV, the John K. Baldwin Irrevocable Trust, and any account for which
Baldwin has signing authority is denied to the extent that such accounts are not or
were not also owned by Baldwin and/or Bridge during the relevant time period.
Moreover, Lao PDR is not entitled to Baldwin and Bridge’s unredacted account
statements. Baldwin and Bridge shall produce redacted statements showing only
information that might reasonably be interpreted as relating to the Awards or the
conduct that led to the arbitrations. Likewise, Lao PDR’s request for communications
between Baldwin and Idaho Independent Bank from January 1, 2012 to December
31, 2019 is limited to communications that might reasonably be interpreted as

relating to the Awards or the conduct that led to the arbitrations.®

8 Ranza v. Nike, Inc., relied on by Lao PDR in support of its argument that the Court
can use alter ego liability to find personal jurisdiction over a defendant, is inapposite.
See 793 F.3d 1059 (9 Cir. 2015). In that case, the Ninth Circuit found that it could
not exercise jurisdiction over Nike’s subsidiary despite numerous contacts with the
forum. Id. at 1069-70. Moreover, there was no dispute over the district court’s
jurisdiction over Nike, which the plaintiff attempted to use to gain jurisdiction over
the subsidiary. Here, in contrast, it is unclear whether the Court has jurisdiction
over Baldwin, Bridge, Sanum, or LHNV, the latter two of which are not even parties.
9 Although the Court is not obligated to rewrite overly broad discovery requests, see
In re Pioneer Corp., No. cv-18-4524, 2018 WL 4963126, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 27, 2018)
(collecting cases), the Court has broad discretion to manage discovery, including to
narrow such requests. Id. at *6—7.

C. Proposed Discovery in Support of Quasi in Rem Jurisdiction

Lao PDR requests the second category of discovery, “Baldwin and Bridge
Property in Idaho,” in support of its theory that the Court can exercise quasi in rem
jurisdiction over Baldwin and Bridge. Rev. Pl. Br. at 6-7. Lao PDR relies on an
exception to the general prohibition against quasi in rem jurisdiction, set forth in
Shaffer v. Heitner, that “[o]nce it has been determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that the defendant is a debtor of the plaintiff,” the creditor is permitted
“to realize on that debt in a State where the defendant has property.” 433 U.S. 186,
210 n.36 (1977). Although Lao PDR correctly notes that this exception also applies
to the enforcement of arbitral awards, see Glencore Grain, 284 F.3d at 1127, Lao PDR
does not have an arbitral award against Baldwin or Bridge. See TAC Exs. C and D.
The Awards are against Sanum and LHNV, respectively, and no court or arbitral
tribunal has determined that Baldwin or Bridge is a debtor to Lao PDR with respect
to the Awards. See TAC 4 11-13. Indeed, whether Baldwin or Bridge is a debtor to
Lao PDR is exactly the determination that Lao PDR is asking this Court to make.
However, Lao PDR cannot put the cart before the horse: The Court must have
jurisdiction over Baldwin and Bridge before it can make any substantive

determinations regarding alter ego status.1° See Glencore Grain, 284 F.3d at 1127

10 As discussed below, Lao PDR’s construction of alter ego liability as a jurisdictional
question is not persuasive in this case. Although the Ninth Circuit has held that alter
ego status can be used to extend jurisdiction over a party that would otherwise not
be subject to jurisdiction, see Ranza, 793 F.3d at 1071, Lao PDR asks the Court to
engage in a substantive alter ego analysis prior to determining that it has jurisdiction
over any of the alleged alter egos. See Rev. Pl. Br. Without pre-existing jurisdiction
over at least one of the alleged alter egos, the Court cannot analyze the alter ego
question.

MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER - 17

Case 2:20-cv-00195-CRK Document 137 Filed 11/19/21 Page 18 of 23

(quasi in rem jurisdiction available only after “it has been determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that the defendant is a debtor of the plaintiff’ (quoting Shaffer,
433 U.S. at 210 n.36)). For the reasons set forth more fully below, the Court cannot
determine alter ego status without first determining that it has jurisdiction over at
least one of the alleged alter egos.

Because Lao PDR has not satisfied the first requirement of quasi in rem
jurisdiction that a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that Baldwin and
Bridge are Lao PDR’s debtors, the Court finds that any further discovery into
Baldwin and Bridge’s assets in Idaho would not be relevant to the Court’s
jurisdictional analysis. The motion for jurisdictional discovery is denied with respect
to the second category of discovery.

D. Proposed Discovery in Support of Lao PDR’s Alter Ego Theory

Finally, Lao PDR requests extensive discovery into non-parties Sanum and
LHNV in support of Lao PDR’s claim that Baldwin is the alter ego of each of those

entities. Rev. Pl. Br. at 8. Lao PDR relies primarily on Ranza and a District of Oregon

 

case involving a default judgment proceeding. See Rev. Pl. Br. at 8-9 (citing, inter

alia, Ranza, 793 F.3d at 1073; Bunge S.A. v. Pac. Gulf Shipping (Sing.) Pte. Ltd., No.

 

3:19-cv-00491, 2020 WL 1528250, at *2—38 (D. Or. March 31, 2020).!! In opposition,

Baldwin and Bridge cite another District of Oregon case for the position that a court

11 CBF Industrua de Gusa S/A v. AMCI Holdings, Inc. is inapposite because personal
jurisdiction was not an issue before that court. 850 F.3d 58, 73 (2d Cir. 2017). The
other case cited by Lao PDR is distinguishable for the same reason as Ranza, namely
that the court already possessed undisputed jurisdiction over one of the alter egos
prior to analyzing the alter ego question. See Crystalles Int'l Corp. v. Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela, 932 F.3d 126, 138 (8d Cir. 2019).

MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER - 18

Case 2:20-cv-00195-CRK Document 137 Filed 11/19/21 Page 19 of 23

cannot engage in an alter ego analysis prior to determining that it has jurisdiction.
See Def. Br. at 7 (citing Cerner Middle E. Ltd. v. iCapital, LLC, No. 3:16-CV-01631,
2017 WL 2579292, at *2 (D. Or. June 14, 2017), rev'd and remanded on other grounds,
939 F.3d 1016 (9t Cir. 2019).

In Bunge, the District of Oregon held that the plaintiff had met its burden of
establishing a prima facie case that it was entitled to a default judgment, including
that the court had personal jurisdiction over the non-answering defendants. Bunge,
2020 WL 1528250, at *2-3. The plaintiff in Bunge commenced the action against an
arbitral award debtor and the debtor’s alleged alter ego seeking to enforce the award
against the alleged alter ego’s property within the district. Id. at *1.

Although the basic facts in Bunge appear to be similar to this case, the
procedural posture is completely different. In Bunge, the District Court analyzed a
magistrate’s report that had determined that a default judgment was warranted. Id.
Despite the magistrate finding that the two defendants were alter egos, the
magistrate did not determine whether the court had personal jurisdiction. Id. at *2.
Thus, the District Court analyzed whether it had jurisdiction over the claims. Id.

The Bunge court relied exclusively on Ranza in support of its finding that “alter egos

 

may be analyzed as if they were a single entity.” Id. The court thus found, “For the
reasons set forth in the [magistrate’s report], the Court concludes that [the
defendants] are alter-ego entities, and therefore, the London tribunal had jurisdiction
to issue its judgment.” Id. Given this finding, the court held that it was appropriate
to exercise quasi in rem jurisdiction over the defendants based on the alter ego’s

property within the district. Id. at *2-3.

MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER - 19

Case 2:20-cv-00195-CRK Document 137 Filed 11/19/21 Page 20 of 23

However, it does not appear that the Bunge court analyzed the question of
whether it had jurisdiction to make the alter ego finding. In Ranza, the only case on
which the Bunge court relied, there was no question that the court had jurisdiction

over the parent company, Nike. Ranza, 793 F.3d at 1071 (describing Nike as a “local

 

parent”). Therefore, the Ranza court did not have to undertake an alter ego analysis
as a pre-requisite to finding jurisdiction; rather, it had jurisdiction over Nike and
merely investigated if that jurisdiction could be extended to Nike’s subsidiary by
finding the subsidiary and Nike were effectively one and the same. Id.

Here, on the other hand, the Court does not have jurisdiction over the award
debtors, Sanum and LHNV, as those entities are not parties to this suit. Even if Lao
PDR had joined Sanum and LHNY,, it is unclear based on the record before the Court
if Sanum or LHNV have any property in, or sufficient contacts with, Idaho. Thus,
the Court would need to determine its jurisdiction over Sanum and LHNV prior to
reaching any alter ego analysis. See Glencore Grain, 284 F.3d at 1122 (“In suits to
confirm a foreign arbitral award under the Convention, due process requires that the

district court have jurisdiction over the defendant”); see also Ranza, 793 F.3d at 1071

 

(‘Ranza seeks to impute local parent’s contacts to a foreign subsidiary . . . whereas
the alter ego test has traditionally been used to bring a controlling parent into a
controlled subsidiary’s home forum, Ranza attempts to use the test to bring a
controlled subsidiary into the controlling parent’s home forum”). Here, neither
Baldwin, Bridge, Sanum, nor LHNV are subject to general jurisdiction, as Nike was
in Oregon, so the Court would need to find jurisdiction over at least one of those

entities prior to analyzing Lao PDR’s alter ego claim.

MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER - 20

Case 2:20-cv-00195-CRK Document 137 Filed 11/19/21 Page 21 of 23

Glencore Grain is instructive here: The Ninth Circuit held that quasi in rem
jurisdiction is appropriate only after “it has been determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that the defendant is a debtor of the plaintiff.” Glencore Grain, 284 F.3d

at 1127 (quoting Shaffer, 433 U.S. at 210 n.36). Although an arbitral tribunal has

 

determined that Sanum and LHNV are debtors of Lao PDR, no court of competent
jurisdiction has determined that Baldwin and Bridge are debtors of Lao PDR. This
Court cannot make that determination without first having personal jurisdiction over

Baldwin and Bridge. Id.; see also Cerner, 2017 WL 2579292, at *2 (finding that court

 

 

did not have jurisdiction to determine whether individual defendant was alter ego of
award debtor because he was not a signatory to the arbitral contract and no court of
competent jurisdiction had determined that he was subject to the award). !2

Because the Court must have personal jurisdiction over Baldwin and Bridge
before it can undertake an analysis of whether they are alter egos of Sanum and
LHNV, and there is no allegation that the Court already possesses jurisdiction over
Sanum or LHNV, discovery into Sanum and LHNV’s corporate histories and their

relationships with Baldwin and Bridge would not aid the Court in determining its

12 The problem with Lao PDR’s position becomes clear when considering the
possibility that the Court analyzes the alter ego question prior to determining
jurisdiction over at least one of the alleged alter egos and finds Sanum and LHNV to
not be Baldwin’s or Bridge’s alter egos. In that case, the Court would not have
jurisdiction over any of the alleged alter egos, yet the Court would have made a
critical substantive finding, a finding that could have ramifications on Lao PDR’s
ability to enforce the Awards, without any jurisdiction to have made such a finding.

jurisdiction over Baldwin and Bridge. Lao PDR’s motion for jurisdictional discovery
is denied with respect to the third category of discovery. !8
IV. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Lao PDR’s motion for jurisdictional discovery is
granted in part and denied in part, and it is

ORDERED that Lao PDR’s motion is granted in part and denied in part; and
it is further

ORDERED that within 30 days from the date this Memorandum Decision and
Order is filed, Baldwin and Bridge shall produce all account statements from January
1, 2012 through December 31, 2019 for any account at Idaho Independent Bank that

Such statements shall be redacted to include only information that might reasonably
be interpreted as relating to the Awards or the conduct that led to the arbitrations;
and it is further

ORDERED that within 30 days from the date this Memorandum Decision and
Order is filed, Baldwin and Bridge shall produce communications between Baldwin
and Idaho Independent Bank from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2019 that might
reasonably be interpreted as relating to the Awards or the conduct that led to the

arbitrations; and it is further

13 The Court’s denial of any discovery related to Sanum and LHNV allegedly being
Baldwin’s alter egos includes Lao PDR’s request to take the deposition of Clay
Crawford.
