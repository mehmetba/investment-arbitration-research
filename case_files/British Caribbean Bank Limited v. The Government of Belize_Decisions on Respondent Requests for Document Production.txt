dispute is simply about a
loan that BCB purportedly
made to Belize Telemedia.
However, BCB and the
majority shareholders in
Belize Telemedia are all
owned and or controlled by
the same persons or entities
that comprise the Ashcroft
group. The identity of
predecessors of BCB and
ownership of predecessors
of BCB is therefore relevant

of the predecessors of
BCB is not relevant to
this dispute. As noted in
paragraph 38 of the
Statement of Defense
(“SoD”), until 9
February 2009, BCB
was known as The
Belize Bank (Turks and
Caicos) Limited. Exhibit
C-12 makes it clear that
its predecessor was the
Belize Bank (Turks and
Caicos) Limited with
effect from 17 February
2009. That fact is not in
dispute.

Itis clear that BCB is a
“company” registered in
the Turks and Caicos
Islands, a territory to
which the Treaty has
been extended under
Article 11 (see SoC, |
137). On that basis,
BCB qualifies as an

BCB objects that the

is not relevant to this

contrary, GOB alleges
that both BCB and the

Belize Telemedia are all
owned or controlled by
the same persons that
comprise the Ashcroft
group. The requested
information is relevant
to show that the
transaction was an
overarching scheme
used by the Ashcroft
group to gain control of
shares of Belize
Telemedia via the illegal
use of the Telemedia
loan and related
facilities. GOB

that BCB raises
concerns the validity of
the loans (see SoD,
section 6). The
ownership of Belize
Telemedia is entirely
irrelevant to this issue.

Without prejudice to the
above, BCB does not
have any documents
which evidence Lord
Ashcroft’s ownership of
Belize Telemedia. At
the date of the BCB loan
agreement, Lord
Ashcroft did not own
shares in BTL whether
directly or indirectly.
BCB Holdings Limited,
which was the parent
company of BCB at the
time the loan was
entered into held
approximately 2.49% in
Belize Telemedia.
Those shares were held
on trust for Dunkeld
International

 

shares of Belize
Telemedia via the illegal
use of the Telemedia
loan and related
facilities. GOB
contends that the loan
was a sham transaction
designed merely to shift
assets between
companies and was no
investment at all. BCB
also has claimed that
GOB’s actions were
intentionally directed at
Lord Ashcroft’s interests
in Belize, including
BCB and Telemedia.

between the parties
about the various uses to
which Belize Telemedia
Limited (Telemedia)
might put the Telemedia
Loan to ~ these are
clearly stated in Article
1(b) of the Telemedia
Loan itself.

As to the vague and
unparticularised
allegation that the
Telemedia Loan was a
“sham” this is in any
event an allegation
which has no legal or
factual basis.

The Government
controls Telemedia and
knows precisely how the

While it is a matter for
Telemedia, and not
BCB, how such funds
were used, it is also

 

 

 

BCB then makes the
assertion that there is no
“factual basis” for such
allegations. That topic
is precisely the subject
of the documents sought
by GOB’s discovery
requests.

BCB then proceeds to
argue the merits of
whether the Telemedia
loan was a legitimate
transaction. This
illustrates that BCB is
simply talking out of
both sides of its mouth.

BCB further asserts that
there is no need to
engage in discovery to
determine BCB’s level
of participation in the
transaction because it is
undisputed that the loans
in question were
provided by BCB to
BTL. This is ared
herring. GOB alleges

Any suggestions that the

Article 1(b) of the
Telemedia Facility (see
Amd SoC 168; SoD,
220). The due diligence
that BCB may have
undertaken prior to
providing to these loans
will, at best, reveal
BCB’s assessment of the
risk of default, and are
therefore irrelevant to
the GoB’s case.

In any event, the GoB
request refers to “all
Joan and document files’
held by BCB without
specifying the date range
of any documents it is
requesting. To satisfy
the requirement under
the IBA Rules on
Taking of Evidence that
the requesting party
must identify a “narrow
and specific category of
[dlocuments” (article
3(a)(ii)), GoB must, at
the minimum, specify

 

 

otherwise any sham
transaction could be
legitimized by the
language of the contract.
GOB alleges that the
purpose was other than
what was stated in the
agreement and GOB is
entitled to discovery on
that issue.

BCB further asserts that
its internal loan file will
simply evidence the due
diligence it conducted,
which will reveal BCB’s
assessment of the risk of
default. BCB asserts
that such evidence is
irrelevant to GOB’s
case. This is also a red
herring. Discoverable
evidence is that which
may lead to the
discovery of admissible
evidence. This
discovery request is
intended to determine
BCB’s knowledge level

In any event, the “route

not in dispute that an

(not $22.5m) was sent

adduced documentary
evidence showing this
(see Exhibits C-63 and
C-64). Exhibit C-63 in
particular mirrors GoB’s
own evidence of BTL’s
account statement (see
JW-12). So both BTL’s
own bank statements
and BCB’s own records

argues that it has already
produced sufficient
evidence establishing
the “route of the

were not relevant, BCB
would have no need to
produce any such
evidence in the first
place.

Again, BCB believes
that it can decide for
itself what is sufficient,
what is relevant, and
what is disputed and
undisputed. It cannot.
GOB has claimed that
the transaction was a
sham, so it is entitled to
the requested
documentation to
examine the specific
trail of the funds, to
establish that the funds
were transmitted and to
whom and where, as
discussed above. If the

It is not in dispute that
BTL issued certain
shares as a dividend to
its shareholders in
August 2007. Clearly,
therefore, this
distribution of shares

that such evidence
cannot be used to
establish that the Loan
was used to fund an
illegal purchase of
Belize Telemedia’s
shares.

As is obvious, evidence
