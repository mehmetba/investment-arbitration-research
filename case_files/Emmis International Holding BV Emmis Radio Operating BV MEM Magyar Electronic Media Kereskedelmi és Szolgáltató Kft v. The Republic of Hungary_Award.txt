ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

1. INTRODUCTION

The present dispute is submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID or the Centre) on the basis of the Agreement between the Kingdom of the
Netherlands and the Hungarian People’s Republic for the Encouragement and Reciprocal
Protection of Investments dated 2 September 1987, which entered into force on 1 June 1988
(the Netherlands BIT), the Agreement Between the Swiss Confederation and the Hungarian
People’s Republic on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments dated
5 October 1988, which entered into force on 16 May 1989 (the Switzerland BIT and jointly with
the Netherlands BIT, the Treaties), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965, which entered into

force on 14 October 1966 (the ICSID Convention).

The Claimants are Emmis International Holding, B.V. (Emmis International), Emmis Radio
Operating, B.V. (Emmis Radio), and MEM Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi és Szolgaltaté
Kft. (MEM). Emmis International and Emmis Radio are both corporations organised and existing
under the laws of the Netherlands. MEM is a company organised and existing under the laws of
Hungary, controlled by Mr Jiirg Marquard, a Swiss national. These parties will be collectively

referred to hereinafter as Claimants.

The Respondent is Hungary and is referred to hereinafter as Hungary or Respondent.

The Claimants and the Respondent will be hereinafter collectively referred to as the Parties.

The dispute relates to the alleged unlawful expropriation by Respondent of Claimants’
investments in a national FM-radio frequency broadcasting licencee, Slager Radio

Misorszolgaltat6 Zrt. (Slager or Slager Radio).

After careful consideration of the Parties’ written submissions and oral presentations, this Award
rules on Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction and request for dismissal of Claimants’ claims
pursuant to ICSID Convention Articles 25 and 41, and Rule 41 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for
Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), on the grounds that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction

ratione materiae and ratione voluntatis to adjudicate the case.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

Il. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Tribunal set forth the procedural history of this matter from the filing of the Request for
Arbitration on 28 October 2011 until 10 March 2013 in its Decision on Respondent’s Objection
under ICSID Rule 41(5) dated 11 March 2013 (Rule 41(5) Decision).

By paragraph 85 of the Rule 41(5) Decision (the dispositif), the Tribunal decided, inter alia, to:

(1) Grant Respondent’s objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules
to the extent of dismissing all Non-Expropriation Claims from these

proceedings as being outside the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction;

(2

Deny Respondent’s objection under Rule 41(5) in respect of the Customary

International Law Expropriation Claim; and

(3

Join any further objection to the jurisdiction of the Centre in respect of the
Customary International Law Expropriation Claim, to the extent maintained, to

the merits.

The Tribunal included the procedural history of this matter between 10 March and 12 June 2013
in its Decision on Respondent’s Application for Bifurcation dated 13 June 2013 (Bifurcation

Decision).

By paragraph 57 of the Bifurcation Decision (the dispositif), the Tribunal decided, inter alia, that:

(1) There shall be a preliminary hearing on Respondent's jurisdictional objection,

namely as to the questions:

(a

What rights, if any, did Claimants have under Hungarian law in 2009 in respect
of the renewal of their broadcasting licence for any period after 18 November

2009;

(b

To what extent, if at all, did those rights constitute an investment for the
purpose of the jurisdiction of the Centre under Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention and an investment capable of giving rise to a claim for

expropriation within the competence of this Tribunal under the Treaties; and,

(c

Does the present dispute arise directly out of such investment for the purpose

of Article 25?

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

In accordance with this Decision, the Tribunal made provision for the Parties to submit written
and oral pleadings on these issues. Pursuant to paragraph 57(2) of the Bifurcation Decision, the
Tribunal further decided to adopt the procedural calendar set forth under paragraph 12.8.1 of
Procedural Order No. 1, as amended by Procedural Order No. 2 and the Parties’ agreement of

28 April 2013, as adopted by the Tribunal on 1 May 2013.

On 9 August 2013 (in accordance with the Tribunal’s adopted procedural calendar), Respondent

filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction (Memorial on Jurisdiction).

On 19 September 2013, Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial submission on Jurisdiction

(Counter-Memorial).

On 23 October 2013, Respondent filed its Reply submission on Jurisdiction (Reply).

On 25 November 2013, Claimants filed their Rejoinder submission on Jurisdiction (Rejoinder).

The Parties agreed that a two-day oral hearing on jurisdiction would suffice. Neither Party
indicated a wish to examine or cross-examine witnesses or experts. Accordingly, the hearing was

by agreement confined to submissions by counsel and questions from the Tribunal.

During the Hearing the Parties confirmed their prior agreement not to examine the witnesses
and experts presented by each side. Counsel for Claimants summarised the basis upon which the

Parties had reached such agreement as follows:

The agreement, as recorded in the communication between Counsel, is that no
Report of any Expert or Statement of any Fact Witness is to be treated as
withdrawn, and the agreement not to cross-examine an Expert or Fact Witness
on any point or points is not to be taken by either Counsel or the Tribunal as an
admission as to the accuracy or relevance of that point or points, and Counsel
retain the right to make submissions to the Tribunal as to the accuracy,
credibility, or probative value of any Expert or Fact Witness’ evidence.*

The Parties also agreed during the Hearing to introduce two new documents into the record.”

At the conclusion of the Hearing, the Parties confirmed their agreement with the Tribunal’s
proposal that post-hearing briefs were not necessary in this case.’ Accordingly, the President
declared the evidentiary and submissions phase of the jurisdictional part of these proceedings
closed, provided however that the Parties were ordered to provide the agreed English
translations of any disputed Hungarian texts by 9am on 18 December 2013 and to submit

schedules of costs by 31 January 2014.

The Tribunal deliberated in person, including on 17 and 18 December 2013 and by other means

of communication.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

Ill, FACTUAL BACKGROUND

In the early nineteen-nineties, Hungary began to adopt policies to attract foreign investment,
modernise its infrastructure and improve competition in the provision of services. Within this
context, on 21 December 1995, Hungary adopted Act | of 1996 radio and television broadcasting
(the Media Law),’ seeking to attract the expertise, technology and necessary capital to
modernise its broadcasting services, while providing for fair and open procedures for the

allocation of radio and television airwaves and promoting freedom of the media.°

Pursuant to the Media Law, Hungary created the National Radio and Television Broadcasting
Board (ORTT), an administrative body and independent legal entity with oversight power over
the tender procedures and in charge of regulating and concluding Television and radio
broadcasting agreements in accordance with the Media Law.° ORTT Members are appointed by
the political parties represented in the Parliament. The Chairman is jointly nominated by the

President and Prime Minister of Hungary.”

On 30 August 1996 and pursuant to section 91 of the Media Law, ORTT adopted the General

Terms of Tender (the GTT), a set of rules “relating to the contents and the evaluation of the

8

broadcasting contracts” for the tendering of radio and television broadcasting frequencies.

On 10 June 1997, ORTT called a public and competitive tender process for rights to broadcast
two nationwide commercial radio FM frequencies, under certain rules and specifications as to

the preparation, submission and evaluation of bids, referred to as the 1997 Call for Tender (the

* Act | of 1996 in Radio and Television Broadcasting, 11 February 1996, (CA-3/R-8). Hungary adopted a new
Media Law in 2010. According to Act LXXXII of the 2010 Media Law, ORTT has been replaced with a new
regulatory agency called the Media Council. See Claimants’ Memorial, FN 24.

771/206/4-7.

® Media Law, section 91(1); (CA-3/R-8); see General Tender Terms of the National Radio and Television
Commission, 30 August 1996, (CA-4). The status and significance of the GTT was an issue in dispute
between the Parties. The Respondent contended that the GTT is “a set of general terms and conditions [...]
not a source of law under the Hungarian legal system, and [cannot] grant any proprietary rights.”
(Memorial on Jurisdiction, [21]). Claimants relied on the evidence of its legal expert, Dr Molndr, to suggest
that “the GTT is a body of mandatory rules that provides bidders with substantive rights enforceable by the
Hungarian courts.” (Counter-Memorial, [42]).

1997 CFT).° The 1997 CFT included the text of the broadcasting agreement to be concluded with

the winning bidder, and was, in turn, governed by the GTT and the Media Law.

Slager Radié, a Hungarian company 100% owned by Claimants, was the successful bidder of one
of the two frequencies.”° On 18 November 1997, Slager, and ORTT, concluded a broadcasting

agreement (the Broadcasting Agreement), governed by Hungary’s Media Law.

In accordance with clause 2.3 of the Broadcasting Agreement, Slager’s licence was “issued for
seven (7) years, subject to the provisions of the [...] Contract.” This provision also stipulated that

“(flor the renewal of the Broadcasting License, § 107 of the Act shall be applicable.”

Pursuant to section 107(1) of the Media Law, “[b]roadcasting rights for [radio are valid] for
maximum seven years, and may be renewed once upon expiry at the broadcaster’s request,
without inviting a tender, for an additional five years.”””

Slager’s initial seven-year broadcasting licence ending on 18 November 2004,”* was renewed for
a five-year term ending on 18 November 2009.“ From 1997 to 2009 Claimants conducted a
successful operation and became a recognised national commercial radio station in Hungary.*°
Claimants submit that during that time Slager followed a strict practice of journalist

independence and operated without the influence of political partisanship. ”®

° See 1997 Call for Tenders, 10 June 1997, (R-10).

*° slager’s shareholding is divided as follows: Emmis International holds 59.7 percent; Emmis Radio holds
25.3 percent and MEM holds 15 percent. See Memorial, [48]. The other national FM frequency was
awarded to Danubius Radio, another foreign owned Hungarian company, whose shareholders also
instituted separate arbitration proceeding against Hungary before ICSID (see Bifurcation Decision, [10]).

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

It is undisputed between the Parties that Slager enjoyed the full twelve-year term of the 1997
Broadcasting Agreement.”’ Nevertheless, the relationship between the Parties was not without

incident.

On 5 December 2001, representatives of Emmis met with ORTT representatives on behalf of
Slager Radid, seeking a renegotiation of the broadcasting agreement with a view to lowering fees

and rescheduling payments.”®

On 20 December 2001, citing unlawful actions and infringements of the Broadcasting Agreement
for failure to pay the corresponding portion of the broadcasting fee, ORTT resolved to terminate
the Slager Broadcasting Agreement with immediate effect.’® Slager challenged the resolution
and commenced local legal proceedings. On 5 December 2002, the ORTT and Slager entered into
a settlement agreement and Slager continued broadcasting pursuant to the 1997 Broadcasting

Agreement.”

Slager and ORTT entered into further settlements agreements in 2005 and 2007 to resolve
disputes between Slager and ORTT relating to fines ORTT had levied against it for infringements

of its broadcasting obligations.”*

On 1 November 2008, a bill was introduced in Hungary’s Parliament, to amend the “single
renewal” rule of section 107 of the Media Law, to permit further renewals without a tender of
the two national analogue broadcasting licences expiring in 2009.” The amendment sought to
extend the licences for additional five-year periods until the completion of a switchover of
analog radio spectrums to digital radio broadcasting which had been provided for by Parliament

in 2007.” Claimants had lodged submissions with the Parliamentary Media Committee in

” See Memorial, [68] - [72].

*° See ORTT Decision No. 1787/2001 (XII.20.), 20 December 2001, (R-24).

?° Memorial on Jurisdiction, [42] — [43]. In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, Slager would
comply with the original broadcasting fee terms for the remainder of the 7-year term, in exchange for the
undertaking that ORTT will extend its licence otherwise set to expire in 2004 for an additional 5 years anda
lower fee will be applicable in that latter period. See Composition Agreement between the National Radio
and Television Commission and Slager Radid, 5 December 2002, (C-117). See also 2002 Slager Annual
Report and Supplementary Index, (R-26).

September 2008 supporting this amendment.”* However, the President of Hungary refused to
sign the bill into law and sent it to the Constitutional Court for review, which declared it

unconstitutional.”°

Accordingly, on 20 July 2009, ORTT conducted a call for tenders to award broadcasting rights
over two national FM frequencies, one of which was held by Slager, the other one by Danubius

Radio (the 2009 CFT).”° Both Slager and Danubius submitted bids, but lost to other contenders.”

Claimants submit that the 2009 tender process was “highly irregular” and “unlawful”.”* In
particular, they claim that, among other irregularities, the prevailing bidders (i) had prohibited
conflicts of interest that should have disqualified their bids, including the bids submitted by FM1.
Consortium and Danubius;” (ii) unfeasible business plans, offering a “patently unreasonable
broadcast fee proposal,” that was lowered once the tender process ended,” and (iii) no national
broadcasting experience, as the prevailing bidders, Advenio and FM1 Consortium, did not exist

until just before the bids were due.**

Claimants also argue that the tender process was tainted by political partisanship. The
Government at the time was led by the Socialist Party (MSZP), but its influence was waning in
advance of the 2010 elections following which, Hungary’s Conservative Party (Fidesz) in coalition
with the Christian Democratic People’s Party (KDNP), secured a majority in Parliament and
became the Government.” In 2009, the ORTT was composed of a Chairman (jointly nominated
by the President and the Prime Minister), and 5 members: two nominated by the MSZP Socialist
Party, two nominated by Fidesz Party, and its ally, KDNP, and one by the SZDSZ (the Liberal

(Alliance of Free Democrats) Party).**

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

During the period in which the tender was conducted, the Hungarian press reported that the
leading MSZP and opposition Fidesz were collaborating to use their influence over ORTT to
replace Slager and Danubius, with new operators, loyal supporters of the two parties.** On this
basis, among others, Claimants argue that the Members of ORTT who had been nominated by
the two main parties, “acted in concert [...] to deliver the two national frequencies to new,
politically-connected Hungarian bidders,”*® and suggested that the MSZP and the Fidesz had
reached a “secret backroom political ‘deal’ to split the national radio frequencies.”* The
Hungarian press also reported that both Slager and Danubius received warnings that they should
reach accommodations with the two leading parties to have a chance of renewing their

broadcasting rights.”

On 28 October 2009, ORTT announced that Advenio and FM1 Consortium had won the tender.*®
ORTT executed new licence agreements with Advenio and FM1 on 4 November 2009.*° The new
licencees commenced broadcasting activities, thereby replacing Slager and Danubius, on

19 November 2009.*°

On 2 November 2009, Slager and Danubius requested emergency injunctions from the Hungarian
courts, seeking to prevent ORTT from executing broadcasting agreements with the prevailing
bidders.“* They further sought a declaration from the courts that ORTT’s broadcasting
agreements with FM1 and Advenio, were unlawful.“* The Metropolitan Court of First Instance

new anti-corruption legislation could be an important factor in helping meet the aspirations of

Hungary’s citizens for renewed economic growth, and prosperity.”*°

In December 2010, Hungary amended the Media Law, and subsequently enacted a new Media
Law (Act CLXXXV of 2010 on Media Services and Mass Media).°*" Among other elements, section
207(7) of the new law provides that unlawful agreements concluded between ORTT and
licencees can only be terminated if the unlawful situation were caused exclusively by the
broadcaster and not by ORTT. In addition, the Law permits the Media Council (the new
regulatory agency that replaced ORTT) to reduce the broadcast fees that were unrealistically
high. On this basis, according to the Claimants, neither the FM1 nor the Advenio contract could
be terminated. Moreover, the Media Council has the discretion to lower the high broadcast fees

that the winning bidders had included in their bids, if it wishes to do so.”

The enactment of the Media Law raised concerns among the organs of the European Union (the
European Commission® and the European Parliament) the Council of Europe® and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,” over the effects of the Law on the

independence of the media and freedom of expression.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

(a) What rights, if any, did Claimants have under Hungarian law in 2009 in respect
of the renewal of their broadcasting licence for any period after

18 November 2009;

(b

To what extent, if at all, did those rights constitute an investment for the
purpose of the jurisdiction of the Centre under Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention and an investment capable of giving rise to a claim for
expropriation within the competence of this Tribunal under the Treaties; does
the present dispute arise directly out of such investment for the purpose of

Article 25?

In summary, Respondent’s case is that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the present dispute
because “only rights that are proprietary are capable of expropriation” and “Claimants have
failed to demonstrate the existence of proprietary rights capable of expropriation or a dispute

arising directly out of an investment in relation to the 2009 tender.”*®
In response, Claimants contend that the Tribunal has jurisdiction because:

It is undisputed that the Claimants jointly hold 100 percent of the shares in
Slager, and those shares are “assets” that qualify as a covered “investment”
under both applicable BITs and the ICSID Convention. Alternatively, the
Claimants’ investment is their interest in Slager as a business operation,
comprising all of its value, including their indirect interest in the legal rights and
assets held by Slager under Hungarian law, the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement
and 2009 Regulatory Framework. Viewed in this sense too, Slager (and its rights)
is a covered “investment” under the Treaties and the ICSID Convention.

Furthermore, the Claimants’ investment was capable of giving rise to an
expropriation claim under the Treaties. It is well-established as a matter of
international law that indirect expropriation may affect a broad range of
intangible assets with economic value, including inter alia shares in a company,
and tangible and intangible rights held by an investment vehicle.®

[..] Hungary’s actions had a direct bearing on the value of the Claimants’
shareholding investment [and in their interest in Slager as an enterprise or
business operation]. The dispute therefore arises directly out of the Claimants’
investment that was impacted by Hungary’s measures.**

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

A. Claimants’ rights under Hungarian Law

The Parties are agreed that the nature of any rights that might form the basis of Claimants’

expropriation claim are to be determined under Hungarian law.”

In its Bifurcation Decision, the Tribunal defined the material time at which it should assess this

question:

[...] Claimants advance no claim about Respondent’s conduct prior to 2009.
Equally, neither party disputes that Claimants retained their rights under the
Broadcasting Agreement including the broadcasting licence until 18 November
2009. The Claimants’ claim turns upon an allegation that they held valuable
rights, which in the circumstances entitled them to renewal of their licence after
18 November 2009 ‘as long as Slager provided good radio broadcasting services,
complied with the Contract Framework and offered a reasonable broadcast fee’,
which rights were expropriated. The Claimants seek compensation for the lost
value of their investment in Slager consequent upon their loss of the licence
following the 2009 Tender. It follows that the material time at which the
Tribunal must assess the question of the rights and investments held by
Claimants is at the conduct of the 2009 Tender immediately prior to
18 November 2009.

The Parties exchanged extensive submissions on the question of the rights and investments held
or allegedly held by Claimants, both, (a) arising generally from the 2009 Tender and
(b) arising from the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement, including the right to an incumbent
advantage applicable during the 2009 Tender and an entitlement to the renewal of the licence
after 18 November 2009. Both questions were further elaborated in oral pleading. The Parties’

submissions on each of these issues are summarised in turn.

1. General rights in the 2009 Tender

The Tribunal had requested that the Parties address during the jurisdictional phase the question
of “[the] rights, if any, [that] Claimants ha[d] under Hungarian Law in 2009 in respect of the

renewal of their broadcasting licence [...].”™

According to Claimants, the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement (in effect through the 2009 Tender)
incorporated by reference several legal rights held by Slager under the Media Law (in particular

Chapters II and VI) and the GTT, which rights collectively constitute the Contract Framework.”

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

Further, Claimants allege that the Media Law, the GTT and the 2009 Call for Tender, operated
together to confer valid and enforceable rights on Slager, which rights collectively constitute
what Claimants referred to as the Regulatory Framework. While noting that there is a
considerable overlap between Slager’s rights under the Contract and the Regulatory
Frameworks, the Claimants consider that the aforementioned frameworks constitute the legal

sources of:

[..] several important rights in law and contract, including the right to a fairly
and transparently established tender process, the right for its bid to be
evaluated properly and in accordance with applicable law, and the right not to
have to compete against bidders who should have been disqualified based on
the rules applicable to the tender.

(a) Respondent’s submission

Respondent submits that “neither the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement nor Hungarian Law gave
Slager a proprietary right in relation to the 2009 Tender.”*” According to Respondent, “all Slager
had in the fall of 2009 was an expiring broadcasting agreement, which gave no advantages or

168

guarantees in relation to the 2009 Tender.”” More specifically:

L..] [Cllaimants’ claims to other “legal and contractual rights” under Hungarian
law are either entirely spurious, or amount to simple allegations that ORTT
breached general Hungarian rules and regulations governing tenders, which
apply equally to all bidders and which, even if violated, cannot lead to a losing
bidder being awarded the broadcasting right. Such “rights” are in no way linked
to Slager’s status as an incumbent broadcaster, nor are they otherwise exclusive
or personal to Slager in a manner that would warrant protection as property as a
matter of Hungarian law.

Hungary rejects the proposition that a particular Contract Framework applicable to Slager exists
or existed.”” Contrary to Claimants’ submission, Respondent asserts that neither the Media Law,
nor the GTT can be converted into contractual obligations by virtue of being allegedly

incorporated by reference through the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement.” In particular,

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

Respondent challenges Claimants’ reading of section 3.2 of the Broadcasting Agreement,”
explaining that (a) this provision refers exclusively to obligations of the ‘broadcaster,’ as does the
rest of section 3 of the Broadcasting Agreement and (b) in any case, such provision cannot

transform the Media Law into contractual obligations.”*

Respondent argues that general provisions of law, such as the Media Law and the GTT, cannot be
the source of personal obligations owed to Slager: neither can they be converted into immutable
contractual obligations that come into existence after every tender;” nor can they protect the
beneficiary of a broadcasting agreement from later amendments of the GTT, guaranteeing its

application at the time the Contract is concluded.””*

Relying on the Report of its experts on Hungarian law, Drs Kérmendy-Ekes and Lengyel,

76

Respondent posits that the GTT was a “set of guidelines””” and the primary purpose of the GTT

“was to serve as a set of general terms and conditions applicable to tender participants.”””
Respondent recognises that “the GTT was binding and enforceable with respect to the tendering
authority and the bidders in any particular tender.””® The GTT, however, “was not a source of law
under the Hungarian legal system, and could not grant any proprietary rights.””® Respondent

cites to Drs Kormendy-Ekes and Lengyel to explain that:

[T]o warrant protection under Hungarian law of property, a right must trace its
origins to statutory law, have some kind of recognizable financial value, be
vested in the entitled person, and be capable of entry as an asset on company

” Section 3.2 of the Broadcasting Agreement reads: “The Broadcaster undertakes to observe the provisions
of the Act. The parties hereby incorporate into the present Contract the provisions of the Act relating to
the Broadcasting Right and its exercise in effect at the time of the conclusion of the Contract. The
Broadcaster hereby expressly agrees to use the Broadcasting Right during the full term of its validity in
accordance with the provisions of the Act incorporated into the Contract, whether they are repeated
herein or not.”

* Memorial on Jurisdiction, [76]; see also 12/346/3 — 7; 348/19. In response to a question from the
President, Respondent further explained in oral pleading that the Broadcasting Agreement contained
references to the GTT, even if the Tender terms had no real relevance at that point, for historical purposes,
(T1/117/18).

accounts. [...] The rights Claimants assert — to the extent they even exist - fail to
satisfy these minimum requirements.”

In conclusion, relying on its legal and economic experts, Hungary submits that even if Hungarian
law recognises both traditional property rights and “rights representing assets” capable of being

owned and alienated, “none of the rights asserted by Claimants in relation to the 2009 Tender

BL 82

qualify as proprietary rights””” as these rights are not “personal rights,”"° nor do they

“distinguish Claimants from other bidders.”®* It explains:

To the extent Slager could assert enforceable rights under the GTT or generally
applicable provisions of Hungarian law, these rights were merely procedural in
nature. These “due process” protections extended to Slager for the simple
reason that it chose to participate in the 2009 Tender. They did not extend to
Slager because Slager was the incumbent broadcaster, because Slager had a
contractual entitlement to those rights, or because Slager had made investments
in connection with its operations under the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement. In
other words, none of the asserted rights arose as a result of Slager’s
broadcasting operations in Hungary or qualified as Slager’s property under
Hungarian law.*

(b) Claimants’ submission

In summary, Claimants submit that as party of the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement and under the
2009 Regulatory Framework, as a duly registered bidder, Slager enjoyed the following set of

rights:

the right to an incumbent advantage;

the right to a properly established tender procedure;

the right to a timely tender;

the right to a fair and objective tender evaluation in accordance with
transparent scoring criteria;

the right not to compete against unqualified or improperly qualified bidders; and

= consequent upon the [appropriate] application of the preceding rights, the right
to the 2009 Broadcasting Agreement.”

According to Claimants, these are substantive as opposed to procedural rights, which can be the
subject of evaluation by the Hungarian Courts, and which were grounded on a sound policy
basis: (a) to provide adequate safeguards and benefits for a lawfully operating entity that made
profitable investments in Hungary, and (b) to protect against arbitrary or underhanded

behaviour on the part of ORTT.®®

First, regarding the bundle of rights arising from the Contract Framework, it is Claimants’ position

that:

L...] certain key provisions of the Media Law were incorporated as terms into the
1997 Broadcasting Agreement, including those governing the re-tendering of the
broadcasting right granted in the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement, and the
conclusion of a new Broadcasting Agreement at the end of such re-tendering.

By virtue of that incorporation, the duties and obligations of the ORTT under the
relevant provisions of the Media Law and the GTT indeed became contractual
undertakings of the ORTT vis-a-vis Slager.*”

Claimants submit that “the legal effect of this incorporation is stabilization.”™

Claimants in addition state that the GTT, although not a legislative rule, is a body of mandatory
rules that functions as a source of law in the Hungarian legal system. It is “[binding on] the

issuer and the tender and the bidders identically;”*°

and applies to all aspects of the 2009
Tender.” Pursuant to the Broadcasting Agreement, the GTT forms part of the content of the
Broadcasting Agreement.” Relying on Dr Molnér’s report, Claimants further allege that the GTT

provides bidders with substantive rights enforceable by the Hungarian courts.?

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

Second, regarding the bundle of rights arising from the Regulatory Framework, Claimants
contend that “as a legitimate participant in the 2009 Tender having paid its tender fee and
submitted a compliant bid, Slager was entitled to benefit from the full panoply of rights
conferred upon it by these instruments.”

Based on the preceding arguments, Claimants conclude that “but for Hungary’s breach of
Slager’s right during the 2009 Tender, Slager would have been awarded the 2009 Broadcasting
Agreement.”

The Tribunal will now examine the Parties’ specific submissions first as to an alleged incumbent
advantage in the tender process; and second as to other bases on which Claimants’ alleged a

right to award of the 2009 broadcasting licence.

2. Incumbent Advantage

Claimants posit that:

[A]s operator of the tendered frequency for 12 years in accordance with its 1997
Broadcasting Agreement and applicable law, Slager held the right to an
incumbent advantage, namely an added benefit in the evaluation of its bid that,
combined with a reasonable broadcasting fee offer and fulfillment of the other
tender requirements, offered Slager increased chances of winning the 2009
Tender.”®

Claimants rely upon section 65.3 of the GTT as providing the legal basis for such a right. This

provision reads:

65.3.1 That bidder is advantaged, who has held a broadcasting right awarded in
tender for the frequency forming the subject-matter of the call for tender, if it
operates and broadcasts in accordance with its studio license and the Media Act.

65.3.2 ORTT evaluates at a disadvantage the bidder who holds the broadcasting
right for the frequency forming subject of the call for tenders but its operations
are not in compliance with its studio license and the Media Act.

(a) Respondent’s submission

According to Respondent, neither the Contract Framework nor the Regulatory Framework gave

Claimants the alleged incumbent advantage.” On the contrary, Respondent submits that

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

“suggesting entitlement to an ‘incumbent advantage’ that would essentially guarantee of
continued operation, would be clearly unconstitutional, contrary to the principle of competition,
and contrary to the very notion of a competitive tender.”

In addition, relying on the Kérmendy-Ekes/Lengyel Reports, Respondent contends that section
65.3.1 is not applicable to Slager since this provision only applied to bidders who held indefinite
“studio licenses,” a specific form of broadcasting right pre-dating the Media Law, never held by

Slager:

As explained by Drs. Kérmendy-Ekes and Lengyel, Section 65.3.1 explicitly
applied only to bidders who held “studio licenses”. [...] Under Section 146 of the
1996 Media Law, “studio licenses” were abolished by the new law, but prior
holders of “studio licenses” issued for an indefinite term were granted a certain
advantage in the tenders for broadcasting rights related to the frequencies. All
local and regional tenders cited by Claimants’ expert Dr. Molnar as providing
some points (usually ten) for “lawful operation” on the frequency involved
frequencies on which there had been an incumbent broadcaster with a “studio
license.” Since Slager never held a “studio license,” Section 65.3.1 GTT was not
applicable to it.°°

Moreover, according to Hungary, even under Claimants’ interpretation of section 65.3, Slager
would not have been entitled to the incumbent advantage due to its repeated and severe
breaches of its 1997 Broadcasting Agreement and the Media Law.*” In fact, Slager would have
fallen under section 65.3.2, which imposes a “disadvantage” on an incumbent bidder that failed
to operate in accordance with its licence or the Media Law. Since Slager’s infringement of the
Media Law were both ‘repeated’ and ‘serious’, they would have been sufficient to justify an
incumbent disadvantage.’ Respondent concedes that “ORTT did not have any dedicated
discussion to determine whether or not Slager’s breaches were serious and repeated”!” but
explains that this was because ORTT did not seek to apply a preference or a dis-preference to an

incumbent in the 2009 Tender.

°° Memorial on Jurisdiction, [82], [121].

°° Memorial on Jurisdiction,[78]; see also Reply [76]. According to Respondent, section 65.3.2 applied only
to holders of indefinite studio licences, whereas holders of Studio licences issued for a fixed term should
have transformed their studio licences into Broadcasting Contracts by March 1996, or have their right
forfeit under section 146(1) of the Media Law, (T1/88/6 — 21).

these violations.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

Respondent disagrees with Claimants’ argument that Hungary’s renewal of the licence in 2004
and its decision to conclude a settlement agreement in 2005, according to which ORTT would
agree to refrain imposing new sanctions confirms that Claimants’ licence acted in accordance
with the Media Law.’ The settlement agreement merely reflected a decision not to impose
further administrative sanctions for the wrongful conduct, but not that such conduct was

proper.

Finally, Respondent posits that even if Slager were entitled to benefit from section 65.3.1 of the
GTT, the incumbent advantage would not have been sufficient to guarantee the allocation of the
new licence to Slager, since its bid was not competitive and it fell short of winning the bid by 25
points.’ In any case, “the application of this provision was not sufficiently definite to constitute
a right” on its own.’ If, as Claimants contend, all other bidders should have been disqualified
and Slager should have won as the only qualified bidder, then the incumbent advantage would
have been irrelevant for the alleged right to the 2009 Broadcasting Agreement to vest in

Claimants.”

(b) Claimants’ submission

Claimants submit that section 65.3.1 of the GTT establishes the right of an incumbent to have an
advantage in a new tender of the frequency that it has lawfully operated.’ They further assert
that the provision “gives rise to a right to be advantaged,” that “cannot be assigned [...] as such,
individually”, but the advantage “accrues to the incumbent” and therefore it could have a
“tangible economic value”, that could be valued through either a “commercial assessment”
(looking at market conditions, identifying comparable transactions and the percentage of points
accorded at the issuance of the tender rules) or by simply looking at the points awarded.

Nevertheless, Claimants concede that section 65.3.1 of the GTT does not grant a “decisive”

advantage to the incumbent.” As explained by Dr Molnar:

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

The incumbent advantage does not exclude automatically any bidder from
winning a tender. If the incumbent fails to provide a competitive bid, its
advantage will not save it from losing its broadcasting right.**

Since Claimants also allege a right to have non-qualifying bidders excluded, Claimants accept the

fact that "the incumbent advantage, in fact has no relevance [...] because there is no other
qualifying bidder against which the incumbent needs to be advantaged.”**
Claimants contend that the references to studio licences in section 65.3 are in fact, “a remnant

nila

from the early days of the 1996 Media Law,” ~ and have in practice been applied by ORTT to all

types of broadcasting agreement since “before the 1996 Media Law was enacted, Hungarian

broadcasters operated on the basis of so-called studio licenses, these being precursors to the

broadcasting agreements.”**

Claimants agree that section 65.3.2 provides a corollary rule that handicaps an incumbent that
acted unlawfully.*° They however disagree that Slager had committed “serious or repeated”
breaches such that ORTT would have been entitled to apply the incumbent disadvantage to
Slager.“° Claimants explain that “[u]nder the sanction system created by Section 112 of the 1996
Media Law, combined with well-established ORTT practice, violations would not be considered
as ‘serious’ unless they were notified to the broadcaster pursuant to Section 112(1)(b) of the

Media Law.” Since Slager never received such notices, Claimants contend that even if “it is

true that Slager was found to have committed minor infractions” considered “routine”,"*

“[t]here is no evidence that the ORTT considered Slager as having committed ‘serious and
repeated’ violations in evaluating Slager’s bid during the 2009 Tender.”*” According to
Claimants, both when Slager’s broadcasting right was renewed without a tender in 2004, and

subsequently, after the Parties concluded settlement agreements in 2005 and 2007, ORTT

“declared that all conditions for the extension had been met” and agreed not to “impose

unjustified sanctions on Slager,” reflecting Slager’s compliance with the applicable norms.***

3. Right to the award of the 2009 broadcasting licence

The Parties have presented diverging submissions as to the whether Slager had a right to the
award of a new broadcasting licence after 2009, and in particular, whether such right stems from

section 107 of the Media Law. This provision reads:

(1) Broadcasting rights for television are valid for maximum ten years, and rights
for radio for maximum seven years, and may be renewed once upon expiry at
the broadcaster’s request, without inviting a tender, for an additional five years.
The request for renewal must be notified to the Board fourteen months prior to
expiry.

(2) In the absence of the reporting notification referred to in Subsection (1) or if
renewal cannot be awarded, the Board must publish an invitation to tender
twelve months prior to the expiry of the license.

(3) The license cannot be renewed if the right-holder violated the contract
repeatedly or seriously.

(4) The provisions relating to the award of rights must otherwise apply to the
procedure for the renewal of such rights.

(a) Respondent’s submission

Respondent submits that section 107 of the Media Law is unambiguous and provides for a strict
“Term of Rights,” “limiting the holder of a commercial radio broadcasting right to a ‘maximum’
seven year term, which may be renewed ‘once’ for an additional five years.””* Wherever
contemplated by the Media Law, the possibility of multiple renewals was stated expressly.’ In
contrast with the interpretation advanced by Claimants, Respondent’s interpretation of section

107 is as follows:

Subsection (1) of Section 107 expressly says that the broadcasting right “may be
renewed once,” i.e. not two times or twenty times, and states that the renewal
shall be for “five years,” i.e. not for an indefinite period. Subsection (2) refers to
cases where the single “renewal” allowed by subsection (1) is theoretically
possible, but “cannot be awarded.” The provision clearly distinguishes between
a “renewal” and a “tender” of rights, making Claimants’ asserted entitlement to
“renewals of a broadcasting right by tender” a contradiction in terms.’~*

It further contends that neither Claimants nor ORTT ever suggested that a right to renewal or an
incumbent advantage existed under the Media Law, the GTT, or the Broadcasting Agreement, in

any communication leading up to the submission of bids in the 2009 Tender.’

First, Slager and its shareholders did not assert ‘a legal right’ to continue broadcasting beyond

the 12-year term:”°

= None of Claimants’ documentary exhibits contain any evidence that Slager
asserted, in advance of the 2009 Tender, a right to an incumbent advantage or

other legal entitlement arising out of the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement.”

Slager submitted a bid including a conservative business plan “based ‘only’ on
the seven-year broadcasting term. It included a detailed financial model
projecting profitable operations and a healthy return of investments within the

term.’

According to Emmis’ accounting statements and annual reports from 1997

through 2009, “the Slager broadcasting right was in fact depreciated as a

129

‘definite -lived’ intangible and was fully amortized by the end of 2009 [...].
Accordingly, Emmis did not consider Slager’s broadcasting right as having any

value beyond 2009.”

The Emmis parent company’s regulatory filings before the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (U.S. SEC) reflected the understanding that

after the first renewal there could be no guarantee of renewal.’*

Similarly, the expectations of Claimant MEM, are not based on assurances or
representations by the government, but instead on its own reading of Hungarian

Law or its experience in other countries.”

Second, Hungarian authorities never transmitted to Slager or its shareholders reason to believe

or expect that they held a legal right to licence renewal:

The 1997 Call for Tender clearly stated that what was being put up for tender

was a seven year broadcasting right.’*

The single renewal possibility under the Media Law was by no means a certainty
for Slager, and even Slager lawyers approached Hungarian authorities to confirm

whether a five year renewal would be forthcoming.***

There are no contemporaneous ORTT statements discussing a right to renewal

by incumbent broadcasters. >

Upon expiry of a broadcasting agreement that has been renewed, there is no provision in
Hungarian law requiring ORTT to hold a tender. The ORTT enjoyed broad discretion as to the
policy options they exercised in terms of managing the broadcasting frequency spectrum.’ In
fact, the “State had discretion to re-issue the broadcasting right via tender or, alternatively, to
reassign the vacant frequency to another use.””’ According to Respondent, this point is
supported by the fact that the 2009 Tender was not called on the basis of section 107 of the
Media Law, but rather on the basis of ORTT’s general power to call tenders under section
41(1)(a).*** It further brings to the Tribunal’s attention that Claimants’ own regulatory filings
confirm that “Hungarian Law is silent about what happens after 12 years.”"?

Furthermore, according to Respondent, Claimants lobbied politically for an amendment to the
Media Law introducing a right of renewal to the incumbent licencee, precisely because they
knew that the applicable legal framework did not give them the right to a new Broadcasting

Agreement.’ Such an amendment, while proposed by Congress, was never enacted into law

since it was declared unconstitutional. The Hungarian Constitutional Court declared that
indefinite renewals of the national radio frequencies, even pending transition to digital radio

were unconstitutional because they limited competition and new market entry.“

Respondent rejects Claimants’ argument that Slager’s right to the 2009 Broadcasting Agreement
would in any case vest upon the closure of the bidding process, since all other bidders should
have been disqualified and Slager having submitted the only qualifying bid, had to be awarded
the licence agreement. Instead, according to Hungary, the right to the 2009 Broadcasting
Agreement never vested.’ Respondent alleges that in order to accept such a theory, the
Tribunal would need to find (a) that all the other bidders should have disqualified from
consideration outright; (b) that the Supreme Court of Hungary misread Hungarian Law on
whether the ORTT had improperly conducted the Tender Procedure and breached the Tender
Rules, since the issue of Slager’s alleged wrongful disqualification was litigated and rejected up
all three levels of the Hungarian Courts, including to the Supreme Court, and, (c) that the
Metropolitan Court erred on its reading of Hungarian Law by holding that when a challenger
demonstrates that the winning bidder should have be disqualified, the most it can obtain is the

invalidation of the awarded Contract and possibly the rerunning of the Tender.”

Respondent also rejects Claimants’ theory that the 2009 CFT constituted an offer which was
accepted by Slager when presenting the Bid, thereby constituting a contract, which would bind
the ORTT to proceed to award the licence in accordance with the call for tenders. Respondent
alleges instead that the investors, including Slager, submitted a “tender offer,” the bid itself, to
be accepted or rejected by the ORTT. Furthermore, according to Respondent, pursuant to 2009
CFT Clause 3.44,“ further supported by section 76 of the GTT, the ORTT reserved the right to
declare the tender inconclusive or unsuccessful and disqualify the entire bid process, even in the
event of receiving valid bids if it considers it unsuitable. The bid can however be considered an

irrevocable binding offer, which may be accepted within a limited period of time.““®

Accordingly, since the right to a new licence never vested, Respondent submits that Claimants

cannot claim expropriation of a right they did not hold.““”

(b) Claimants’ submission

Claimants plead that:

[I]t has never been the Claimants’ case that they were entitled to be awarded
the 2009 Broadcasting Agreement. What we say is they had legal rights, which,
had they been respected, would have left them as the only qualifying bidder.
And in that situation, the ORTT was obligated to award the Broadcasting
Agreement to them. [...] And if the Tribunal wipes away the wrongful conduct of
the State, we are left with the entitlement to that Broadcasting Agreement.

The rights that we rely upon are the ones they had vested as part of the
investment, as part of the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement, and to which we were
entitled under Hungarian Law. The consequence of those rights, as of the closing
date of the bids, was that the Claimants became entitled to the 2009
Broadcasting Agreement.**

Claimants conclude that “but for the failure of ORTT to apply the rules of the Tender that they
themselves determined, Slager would have been the only valid bidder, and, therefore, the
winner of the Tender and thus [...] the ORTT would have been obliged to award Slager the 2009
Broadcasting Agreement.”““? According to Claimants, this right vested when the 2009 bid closed,
but was extinguished as consequence of ORTTs violations: “[T]he sequence is that the right
existed, and it was extinguished, not that the right would have existed but for the behavior of
Hungary.”2°

In this case, Hungarian law imposed obligations on ORTT as to the steps to be taken following
expiry of the Licence. Claimants submit that ORTT cannot arbitrarily decide how to reallocate
frequencies after a broadcasting agreement expires, since this is inconsistent with the policy
purposes of the Media Law and also to ORTT’s own statement as expressed in the local
proceedings.’ Claimants agree with Respondent that the 2009 Call for Tender was called by

operation of section 41 of the Media Law but assert that the “timing of the exercise of the

authority” is governed by section 107 of the Media Law.** Accordingly, ORTT had an obligation

to re-tender after the 12 years broadcasting licence expired.

In addition, the 2009 Call for Tenders constituted an offer to abide by the terms of the tender
process that was later accepted unconditionally by Slager through the bid, and simultaneously
undertaking a conditional obligation to conclude the Broadcasting Agreement, with specific and

binding unaltered terms. This is confirmed by the definition of “bid” included in the CFT itself.’**

Claimants reject Respondent’s argument that Claimants did not expect its licence to extend
further than 2009. Respondent has mischaracterised Claimants’ business expectations and
accounting treatment, as “the evidentiary record shows that Slager intended to remain in

Hungary for the longer term” given that:’**

Claimants invested considerable funds and efforts reflecting an investment for
the long term and not limited to a seven-year licence, renewed for five years;"*>
this is confirmed with Emmis’ track record of focusing on strategic investments

rather than short-term deals that turn a quick profit.°>

Claimants continued investing in Slager as late as 2008. Such a decision would be

illogical if the Claimants would have to exit the market in 2009."”

The filings before the U.S. SEC reflect that the Claimants “expected — and [were]
entitled — to be treated fairly in the Hungarian licence-renewal process and had a
legitimate expectation of renewal, but we reported accurately to our investors

that renewal was not a forgone conclusion.”***

The financial records of Slager were prepared in light of the applicable

accounting rules, which did not necessarily let the non-U.S. broadcasting licences

be treated as having “indefinite lives’? but “Emmis expected to be allowed to
continue to enjoy the benefits of their investment well beyond the time that

initial capital for commencement of operations was returned.”*°°

Respondent’s argument fails to distinguish the different times at which the Claimants’ rights
under Hungarian Law vested: “‘[t]he right to operate beyond 2009’ did not vest until the
submission of bids closed in the 2009 Tender, at which point Hungary acted in a manner that
deprived the Claimants of the 2009 Broadcasting Agreement.”*™ Therefore, Claimants would not
have referred to that right before the 2009 Tender and it is unsurprising that forward looking

statements from years before the Tender do not contain this right.’

B. An investment under the Treaties and the ICSID Convention

1. An investment under the Treaties

The Parties agree that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties is the starting point for

interpretation of the Treaties.

(a) Respondent’s submission

Respondent accepts that “Claimants at one time made an investment in Hungary,” but alleges
that “such investment was set to — and did — expire by its own terms in November 2009.”*™ It is

Respondent’s position that:

To meet the definition of “investment” under both the Netherlands and the
Switzerland BITs, Claimants must prove that they had rights in relation to the
2009 Tender that qualify as “assets.” Both treaties expressly tie the definition of
“investment” to assets located in the host State."

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

No definition of “asset” appears in the BITs and Respondent asserts that such word should be
interpreted according to its ordinary meaning, consistent with the object and purpose of the

treaty.
Respondent contends that:

[T]he mere existence of a right under host State law is insufficient to prove that
a protected “asset” exists. Not every “right” created by domestic law constitutes
an “asset.” For example, even though domestic law may create a right to free
speech or to freedom of religion, because such rights are generally applicable
rather than proprietary, and are not capable of being bought or sold for
economic value, they cannot be considered “assets.” Furthermore, even if
generally-applicable legislation provides some incidental benefit to an investor,
the rights to such legislation do not belong to an investor in an ownership sense
and such legislation therefore does not qualify as an “asset” of the investor.*””

Hungary further submits that “investment treaties do not protect pre-contract expenditures, [i.e.
rights related to the process of forming or acquiring an investment] even if made with a strong
expectation of winning the contract.”** According to Respondent, prior ICSID claims have failed
in very similar situations, confirming that “expenditures are irrelevant, process rights are

irrelevant, and even creating a local incorporated company is irrelevant if the Claimant did not,

in fact, acquire the right it claims to have been denied.”?

Endorsing the reasoning of the Apotex, Joy Mining, F-W Oil and Zhinvali tribunals, Respondent

alleges that “a right does not qualify as an ‘asset’ if it is speculative or somehow contingent on

170

future outcomes”’” and concludes that “to merit the protection as an investment under an

investment treaty, a right must have vested specifically in the claimant; it is not sufficient merely

that the claimant seems to have a prospect that the right may vest someday, if some future

event occurs.”"”*

(b) Claimants’ submission

pn t72
t!

Claimants note that “the BITs each protect ‘every kind of asse' and contends that “the BITs

give the term ‘investment’ a broad, nonexclusive definition, recognizing that investment forms

0173

are constantly evolving. Accordingly, Claimants endorse authorities suggesting that BIT

definitions of ‘investment’ should be interpreted broadly in accordance with their plain

language.*”*

Against this background, Claimants submit that they jointly control and are sole owner of the
Hungarian project company, Slager, which constitutes a qualifying investment under both

applicable treaties:

Since 1997 the Claimants made and held investments in the form of their
interests in Slager and its business operations. [...] Slager began broadcasting in
1997 under a Broadcasting Agreement with ORTT that, although due to expire in
2009 following the 2009 Tender, gave Slager not only the right to broadcast, but
also conferred upon it rights and protections relating to the renewal or future re-
tendering of such broadcasting rights. Slager remained a going concern, and the
1997 Broadcasting Agreement had not expired at the time of the measures
giving rise to this dispute.’”°

[The Claimants’ investment] can be looked at in at least two ways. First, it
suffices to note that the Claimants hold shareholdings in Slager, and those
shares are assets constituting a covered investment. Alternatively, the Claimants’
investment is their interest in Slager as a business operation, including the
benefit of the bundle of rights and assets flowing from its 1997 Broadcasting
Agreement in the context of the 2009 Tender. This, too, is a covered investment.
Both viewpoints are correct.’”°

L...][T]he Claimants’ claim is not, and never has been, that its ‘investment’ was an
existing right to a new broadcasting agreement.”

In particular, Claimants re-iterate that (a) their “main assets” in this arbitration are “their shares
in Slager, the existence and validity of which as investments’ is undisputed”*”* and, (b) submit
that a finding that the Claimants’ shares in Slager are covered ‘investments’ under the BITs and

the ICSID Convention is sufficient for this Tribunal to confirm its jurisdiction ratione materiae.’”

Claimants also submit that their indirect interest in the rights and assets of Slager, as a business

operation constitute covered investments under each of the applicable BITs.°

First, the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement remained a valuable asset and constituted a protected
investment since “it contained claims to contractual performance in Hungary having economic
value, and more particularly (a) comprised rights granted under public law (Netherlands-Hungary
BIT, Article 1(1)(e)), and (b) constituted a concession under public law (Switzerland-Hungary BIT,

Article 1(2)(e)].”"*

Second, the Contract Framework conferred rights, which included “the right to broadcast; the
right of Slager as the incumbent bidder to receive a preference or advantage in the tender
process; and the guarantee that all tenders for the renewal of that broadcasting right shall be

conducted according to law, in good faith, and on a fair, non-discriminatory, non-partisan and

transparent basis.”***

Third, the rights stemming from the Regulatory Framework and the Broadcasting Agreement,
included the right to a proper and lawful evaluation of Slager’s bid during the 2009 Tender and
the right to an “incumbent advantage.” The latter in itself “was a valuable asset” according to

Claimants, “in the sense of something to which a third party investor or buyer would assign

economic value in the period leading up to the 2009 Tender.”*?

transactions, a business operation, or an enterprise”.“®° They posit that Claimants’ rights arising
in connection with the 2009 Tender are part of the indivisible whole of the Claimants’

investment."”

. Finally, Claimants reject Respondent’s reliance on the Apotex and Joy Mining decisions, because

the Claimants do not allege their "investment" to be a future right to broadcast:

[T]he Claimants’ interest in Slager is not ‘speculative’, ‘contingent’, a ‘pre-
investment expenditure’, an ‘expectation’ or ‘a hope’. Slager was a going
concern at the time of the 2009 Tender. It held at the material time existing legal

during the 2009 Tender process. [...]."

2. An investment under the ICSID Convention

(a) Respondent’s submission

By reference to the criteria adopted in Salini, Respondent submits that the rights relating to the
2009 Tender cannot qualify as an investment under the “ICSID Convention.”*® Relying on past
arbitral decisions that suggest that “for an investment to exist, a claimant must demonstrate not
only that it has made a contribution” but also that “the contribution has resulted in the

acquisition of rights,”*®° Respondent concludes that no contribution was actually made.

Although the shareholders’ contribution to the debt funding resulted in acquisition of certain

rights in Hungary, a right to broadcast following expiration of the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement

was not among those acquired.’ This conclusion is, according to Respondent, consistent with
Claimants’ investment expectations since “Slager presented financial plans for a business that
would operate for seven years and that would, ‘within those 7 years return its investors their
money and earn them a substantial return, with no assumptions as to what will happen
thereafter.’”* Respondent submits that radio broadcasting is not a capital-intensive activity in
Hungary.’ It does not require an investment into radio transmission infrastructure. The
broadcaster acquires the right to broadcast on a frequency and does not invest in the
transmission infrastructure nor does it own or manage the frequency. It is operated on a rental

model.'**

(b) Claimants’ submission

There is wide controversy as to whether the Salini test, invoked by Respondent, should be
applied as an objective test for the purpose of determining jurisdiction under Article 25 of the

ICSID Convention. ”*

Claimants submit that even addressing the elements of the test as pleaded
by Hungary, Claimants’ investment qualify as an investment for the purpose of the ICSID
Convention as (a) Claimants’ substantial contribution is reflected in the nearly HUF 856 million
that Slager’s shareholders planned to invest in the equity of Slager; (b) the investments were
made in a period spanning over 12 years; (c) the activities carried the requisite degree of risk;
and (d) the investment activities contributed to Hungary’s economic development, since
“Claimants invested nearly 30 HUF billion (about USD 135 million) in Hungary, provided
employment to an all-Hungarian staff, and brought best industry practices from its experiences
around the world [...] and also brought a culture of corporate responsibility and charitable giving

to Hungary.”*°

. Claimants characterise as “artificial” Respondent’s attempt to draw a line between "an old

investment” (its shareholding) and “a new investment” (rights arising out of the 2009 Tender)

since it ignores the concept of business operation, with a company, assets and employees and

overlooks that Claimants’ investments in Slager since 1997 led to the contractual and Hungarian

Law rights relied upon by Claimants.**”

C. Rights capable of expropriation

The Parties are in agreement that “as a general matter of both international and Hungarian law,
contractual rights are capable of being expropriated.”** But they do not agree that the rights

acquired by Claimants in this case were capable of expropriation.

(a) Respondent’s submission

Respondent accepts that Claimants, as indirect shareholders in Slager, are entitled to rely on
Slager’s rights including its contractual rights.’®° The proposition that Hungary disputes is that
Sldger had rights capable of expropriation.”° According to Respondent, “there cannot be an
expropriation claim unless the complaint demonstrates the existence of proprietary rights.’
Hungary recognises that certain ‘intangible’ rights are capable of being expropriated; however,
such rights must be similar to property rights in the sense that they can be owned, acquired,
transferred or sold.””” Hungary rejects Claimants’ contentions that the rights allegedly arising

from the Contract and Regulatory Frameworks can be expropriated.

First, in Respondent’s view, “even assuming, arguendo” that Claimants held an “incumbent
advantage,” ORTT’s compliance with a GTT provision cannot be considered a proprietary right
capable of giving rise to an expropriation claim, in the absence of a specific contractual

undertaking such as a stabilization agreement.”” In particular:

Notwithstanding Claimants’ rhetorical insistence on the notion, the fact remains
[...] that the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement did not create any contractual right
to a dispositive “incumbent advantage.” The exclusive source of the alleged right
to an advantage is Section 65.3.1 of the GTT, which, (1) is an individual passage
of discretionary administrative guidelines; (2) does not represent a source
specified by the Hungarian Law on Legislation to govern property-related issues;
(3) did not clearly apply to the broadcasting right at issue in the 2009 Tender; (4)
may not have been available to Slager in any event, given its numerous breaches

of the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement and 1996 Media Law; and (5) does not
confer proprietary rights on any particular investor constituting an individual
asset capable of expropriation. Moreover, [...] [gliven that ORTT retains full
discretion to define the conditions, scope, and effect of the alleged preference, it
cannot be considered sufficiently concrete to constitute a proprietary right
capable of expropriation. As in Merrill & Ring, the rights alleged herein
constitute ‘only a potential future benefit that cannot be the subject of a taking
because the Investor is not contractually entitled to them.”

112. Second, Respondent emphasises that general process rights arising in connection with the
conduct of the 2009 Tender, are not special to a particular investor or owned as an asset by the

individual investors. Instead “every single one of [the rights] could be claimed by all participants

in the 2009 Tender. They don’t belong to any one participant to the exclusion of others””™ and

therefore cannot be expropriated:

Every bidder in a tender has the right to be treated fairly under the rules of that
tender. And the right to be treated fairly in that context is like the right to free
speech or free religion; you may have it, you may be able to claim violation of it
through certain procedures, but it’s not a right you would hold to the exclusion
of others. [...] Procedural rights in a tender can’t be expropriated, and the
remedy for procedural errors can’t be the award directly to you of the very thing
you were bidding on in the first place, or, as they seek to do in this case, an
immediate skip to a damages phase for the full value of the thing that you were
trying to bid for without even providing the services that are the quid pro quo
for that tender.”

113. Moreover, “given the simultaneously broad and vague nature of this purported right, Claimants

lack the type of ownership or control [over the right] necessary for it to be considered

1206

‘proprietary.

Like the alleged right to an “incumbent advantage,” the only source for
Claimants’ purported right “to have th[e] tender conducted according to law in
good faith and on a fair, non-discriminatory, non-partisan and transparent basis”
is a passage of the GTT — a document that is subject to change and cannot, as a
matter of Hungarian and international law, create proprietary rights. The alleged
“right” is not set forth in any contract, and Claimants have offered no valid basis
on which to distinguish it from the principle of good faith applicable to all
aspects of Hungarian civil law, and therefore to ail participants in the 2009
Tender.”

Likewise, Respondent considers that Claimants are, contrary to the Tribunal’s Rule 41(5)
Decision, “attempt[ing] to transform Claimants’ original fair and equitable treatment claim, to
remain within the boundaries of this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.” However, “if fair and equitable
treatment were a legal ‘right’ whose denial is tantamount to expropriation, every alleged
violation of fair and equitable treatment would also be an expropriation, and the object and
purpose of treaty provisions expressly limiting consent to expropriation claims [...] would be

plainly and improperly defeated.”

Hungary further submits there can be no “expropriation claims” of legitimate expectations under
international law and even if that were the case, none of Claimants’ alleged expectations would
qualify “as objectively ‘legitimate’ - as opposed to being simply subjective expectations” not
binding the government, because there must “be some form of representation or assurance by

the government itself, upon which the investor thereafter relied in making its decision to

invest.”?"°

Based on these elements, Respondent concludes that “Claimants’ claim for expropriation fails at
the threshold level because Claimants cannot establish the existence of a right, constituting an
investment, capable of being expropriated. Claimants have failed to demonstrate that they ‘had
a clear right’ to the award of a new broadcasting license.””’ “The only rights Claimants

possessed were those of an ordinary losing bidder, including the right to challenge an allegedly

improper tender (but not the substantive right to a new broadcasting agreement).”””

(b) Claimants’ submission

Claimants assert that “rights in rem” are not a prerequisite to an expropriation claim and rely on
several arbitral decisions to conclude that “they may also extend to contractual rights.””"* They

further submit that an “indirect expropriation may also be caused by a violation of non-

contractual rights.”*"*

Claimants contend that “direct transferability” of a right, “does not constitute a condition sine
qua non” for a right to be categorised as proprietary.””° They further suggest that, independently
of whether they can be alienated or not, their rights are proprietary in accordance with section
2(1) of the Hungarian Civil Code, which, according to Claimants, requires all rights to be classified
as proprietary if they are not inherent.”°

Contrary to Hungary’s contentions, the relevant provisions of the Media Law and the GTT at
issue, were not generally or even broadly applicable: they either protected specific qualified
persons that had invested considerable sums to qualify for such protection, in a sense “buying”
access to the relevant rights; or conferred a tangible benefit solely on the incumbent broadcaster
as a reward for its prior investments and lawful operation of its frequency.””” Claimants concede
that such rights (other than the incumbent advantage) would accrue to “all Bidders who would
fulfil the requirements and incur the costs in accessing those right”*“® but assert that “the rights
that Slager possesses as an incumbent broadcaster and as a duly registered bidder in the 2009
Tender were not available to the general public, and had real financial value.”*”°

Claimants add that paying a bidding fee in itself does not constitute an investment, but rather
that the “fact that there is a monetary threshold for accessing specific rights and benefiting from
them renders those rights proprietary.”””° The value of the fee is further confirmed by the fact
that under Hungarian law courts can order the reimbursement of the bidding fee as remedy for
the violation of the bidding rights.’”* Claimants further submit that damages may be awarded for
breach of contractual rights. They accept that this would extend, in the case of the rights under
the Regulatory Framework to all disappointed bidders who fulfilled the relevant legal
requirements.”

Claimants submit that the incumbent advantage has a specific economic value and therefore
qualifies as proprietary. They illustrate this point by submitting that if, for example, an

independent third party were to consider entering in the Hungarian market, it would, all other

things being equal, pay a premium to acquire Slager with the incumbent advantage over another

competitor that did not have that advantage.’

Claimants have presented a prima facie case of expropriation for purposes of the jurisdictional
phase, and their claim has been mischaracterised by Hungary as a fair and equitable treatment
claim.” Hungary’s breach of rights arising out of or incorporated in the Broadcasting Agreement
“was capable of amounting to an indirect expropriation of the Claimants’ investment under
international law.”””° Claimants are not alleging a violation of the fair and equitable treatment

standard under the Treaties.

D. Adispute arising directly out of the investment

(a) Respondent’s submission

Respondent submits that the “[i]f the Tribunal agrees with Hungary that Claimants did not have a

right capable of expropriation in relation to the 2009 Tender, it need not reach the last question

of whether the dispute arises ‘directly out of an investment.””””

Should it however examine this question, the Tribunal must examine the relationship between

the measures and the investment and determine whether the requisite connection exists.’”*

Contrary to Claimants’ contention, Respondent does not allege that in doing so, the Tribunal
shall follow a restrictive interpretation of the “arising directly” requirement. Rather, Hungary

relies upon the plain words of the ICSID Convention, seeing no basis to depart from the standard

rules of treaty interpretation in favour of either a restrictive or liberal approach.”

As all of the rights held by Claimants in relation to the 2009 Tender were generally-applicable
rights enjoyed by all bidders — not proprietary rights granted specifically to Claimants as a result

of their contributions, these rights were completely unconnected with any pre-existing

investment or the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement (which contained no additional rights and did

not transform general due process rights into personal obligations owed to Claimants).”°°

This is not sufficient. To comply with the jurisdictional requirements of the ICSID Convention, the
alleged investment must include the rights underlying the expropriation claim, which in turn,
must be capable of expropriation.“ Thus, in order to proceed any further, the 1997
Broadcasting Agreement must have included the rights underlying the claim, and “any argument
based upon the rights Claimants held by virtue of the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement as

Shareholders in Slager or otherwise, must be set aside.””*

Respondent further rejects Claimants’ reliance on the Lemire case.’* In contrast to the present
case, the arbitration agreement in Lemire expressly covered non-impairment by arbitrary and
discriminatory measures of the “expansion of investments.” Therefore it was possible for that
tribunal to establish a causal link between Claimant’s prior investment and the dispute between

the parties.”

(b) Claimants’ submission

. According to Claimants, the dispute arising out of Hungary’s breach of Slager’s rights is a dispute

“arising directly” out of Claimants’ investment:

(a) Arbitral practice’ and commentary”’ have consistently held that the term
“arising directly” should be construed liberally, and what it is required is that
the relevant dispute “be reasonably closely connected.” In this regard, the
“dispute concerning the rights enjoyed by Slager is a dispute arising directly of
the Slager’s business operation regardless of whether individual rights under
the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement and in respect of the 2009 Tender, standing

alone, would qualify as an investment. The rights were "an integral part of an

arise out of physical property of the investor”™ as it can “emanate from the

investment itself or the operations of the investment” or even “concern a

transaction that does not itself constitute an investment;”*”

(b) Bearing in mind the natural and ordinary meaning of the word “directly”, which
means “with nothing or no one in between”, and with support of arbitral
practice, it is plain, as a matter of common English usage that “State’s measures
[that] affect the core objectives of an investment, such as its ‘sustainability or

(

A causal link must be established between the dispute and the investment;
whether the governmental measure is specifically targeted at the investment in
question is irrelevant and therefore Hungary’s measures at stake need not be

specifically targeted at Slager’s shareholding;””

(d) ICSID tribunals and arbitral authority commentary have consistently held that a
dispute with a foreign shareholder relating to the assets of a local company,

such as its contracts or licences, is a dispute that arises directly out of an

investment.”

In conclusion, “Slager was directly subjected to, and legally and economically affected by, the
measures [taken by Hungary in respect of the 2009 Tender.] [...] Hungary’s measures violated

commitments made to, or rights enjoyed by, Slager, and thereby violated Hungary’s treaty

impacted by Hungary’s measures.”**

V. RELEVANT LEGAL TEXTS

130. The Tribunal sets forth below the relevant portions of the legal texts germane to its Decision.

A. ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules

131. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which is found within Chapter II headed “Jurisdiction of the

Centre”, provides:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out
of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or
agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a
national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent
in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no
party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.

132. Article 41 of the Convention, which is within Chapter IV section 3 headed “Powers and Functions

of the Tribunal,” provides:

(1) The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.

(2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the
jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of
the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether
to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits.

133. Arbitration Rule 41 “Preliminary Objections” provides, in relevant part:

(1) Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the
jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of
the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible. A party shall file the objection
with the Secretary-General no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for
the filing of the counter-memorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary
claim, for the filing of the rejoinder—unless the facts on which the objection is
based are unknown to the party at that time.

(2) The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the
proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the

jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence.

(J

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

(6) If the Tribunal decides that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the
Centre or not within its own competence, or that all claims are manifestly
without legal merit, it shall render an award to that effect.

B. Netherlands BIT

134. Article 4(1) of the Netherlands BIT provides:

Neither Contracting Party shall take any measure depriving, directly or indirectly,
investors of the other Contracting Party of their investments unless the following
conditions are complied with:

(a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;

(b) the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking which
the former Contracting Party may have given;

(c) the measures are accompanied by provision for payment of just
compensation. Such compensation shall represent the genuine value of the
investments affected and shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid
and made transferable, without undue delay, to the country designated by the
claimants concerned and in the currency of the country of which the claimants
are nationals or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.

135. Article 1(1) provides:

[T]he term “investments” shall comprise every kind of asset connected with the
participation in companies and joint ventures, more particularly, though not
exclusively:

(a) movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem in respect
of every kind of asset;

(b) rights derived from shares, bonds or other kinds of interests in companies
and joint ventures;

(c) title to money, goodwill and other assets and to any performance having an
economic value;

(d) rights in the field of intellectual property, technical processes and know-how;

(e) rights granted under public law, including rights to prospect, explore, extract
and win natural resources.

136. Article 10 of the Netherlands BIT provides:

(1) Any dispute between either Contracting Party and the investor of the other
Contracting Party concerning expropriation or nationalization of an investment
shall as far as possible be settled by the disputing Parties in an amicable way.

(2) If such disputes cannot be settled within six months from the date either
Party requested amicable settlement, it shall upon request of either disputing
42

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal. In this case the provisions of
paragraphs 3-9 of Article 9 shall be applied mutatis mutandis. [...]

(3) In case both Contracting Parties have become members of the [ICSID
Convention], disputes between either Contracting Party and the investor of the
other Contracting Party under the first paragraph of the present Article shall be
submitted for settlement by conciliation or arbitration to [ICSID].

C. Swiss BIT

137. Article 6(1) of the Swiss BIT provides:

Neither of the Contracting Parties shall take, either directly or indirectly
measures of expropriation, nationalization or any other measure having the
same nature or the same effect against investments belonging to investors of
the other Contracting Party, unless the measures are taken in the public interest,
on a non-discriminatory basis, and under due process of law, and provided that
provisions be made for effective and adequate compensation. The amount of
compensation, interest included, shall be settled in the currency of the country
of origin of the investment and paid without delay to the person entitled
thereto, without regard to its residence or domicile.

138. Article 1(2) provides:

The term “investments” shall include every kind of assets and particularly:

(a) movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem, such as
servitudes, mortgages, liens and pledges;

(b) shares, parts or any other kinds of participation in companies;
(c) claims to money or to any performance having an economic value;

(d) copyrights, industrial property rights (such as patents, utility models,
industrial designs or models, trade or service marks, trade names, indications of
origin), know-how and goodwill;

(e) concessions under public law, including concessions to search for, extract or
exploit natural resources as well as all other rights given by law, by contract or
by decision of the authority in accordance with the law.

139. Article 10 of the Switzerland BIT, which is headed “Settlement of disputes between a Contracting
Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party”, provides in relevant part:
(1) For the purpose of solving disputes with respect to investments between a
Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party and without
prejudice to Article 9 of this Agreement (Settlement of disputes between

Contracting Parties), consultations will take place between the parties
concerned.

(2) If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months, the
parties to the dispute may proceed as follows:

(a) A dispute concerning Article 6 of this Agreement shall upon request of the
investor be submitted to [ICSID] instituted by the [ICSID Convention].

(b) In the event of a dispute not referred to in paragraph (2), letter a) of this

VI. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

A. Introduction

The Tribunal begins its analysis of the questions of jurisdiction placed before it by the Parties for
its decision by making an elementary point that is nevertheless fundamental to the whole of its
reasoning. It is this. An arbitral tribunal owes its jurisdiction solely to the consent of the parties.
In the case of an arbitral tribunal constituted under the ICSID Convention, Article 25 states this
requirement in terms by providing that ‘[t]he jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal
dispute arising directly out of an investment [...] which the parties to the dispute consent in
writing to submit to the Centre’ [emphasis added]. As the Executive Directors stated in their
Report on the ICSID Convention: ‘Consent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of

the Centre.’

Where the instrument evidencing the consent in writing of the host state is a bilateral
investment treaty concluded between that state and the home state of the investor, the scope
of matters capable of being submitted to arbitration by an investor will be determined by

reference to the arbitration agreement providing for investor-state arbitration in the treaty.

In the present case, it is a striking feature of the investor-state arbitration agreements in both
Treaties that they limit the scope of disputes capable of submission to arbitration by an investor
to expropriation claims only. Article 10 of the Netherlands BIT refers only to “[a]ny dispute
between either Contracting Party and the investor of the other Contracting Party concerning
expropriation or nationalization of an investment.” Article 10 of the Switzerland BIT likewise
permits disputes “concerning Article 6 of this Agreement” to be submitted as of right to an
arbitral tribunal. Article 6 is the provision prohibiting “measures of expropriation, nationalization

or any other measure having the same nature or the same effect against investments belonging

to investors of the other Contracting Party.” Disputes concerning any other provision may be
submitted to arbitration only with the consent of both disputing parties. Hungary gave no such

consent in the case of the present dispute.

The Tribunal has already decided this point in its Rule 41(5) Decision. But it is worth dwelling for
a moment on the significant consequence of this point. The Treaties contain undertakings by
both Hungary and, respectively, The Netherlands and Switzerland as to the protection and
treatment to be accorded to investments of the other Contracting Party. Such undertakings
create obligations binding on the Contracting States under international law that go well beyond
the protection from expropriation. But the Contracting States decided to limit the scope of the
right of an investor to invoke the jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal to a single cause

of action.“

This decision by the Contracting States has the following important consequence for the
Tribunal’s analysis. Had the Tribunal been granted a broader jurisdiction, it would have been
possible to determine whether Claimants’ investments in Slager would benefit from, for
example, the Treaties’ fair and equitable treatment standard when it came to adjudging the
Respondent’s conduct of the bid. It would not be so crucial for the Claimants to prove the
existence of a proprietary right pertaining to the 2009 tender under Hungarian law. But if, as
here, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over all claims except expropriation, and it is not alleged that
Hungary expropriated Slager while it held its broadcasting right under the 1997 Broadcasting
Agreement, the only way that the expropriation claim can be held to be within the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction is if Slager had a proprietary right that survived the expiry of its broadcasting right
under that Agreement. The Contracting States’ narrowing of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction thus
necessarily requires the Tribunal to ascertain what rights Slager held in relation to the tendering
of a new licence. This would be the situation in respect of the expropriation claim even if the
Tribunal had a broader jurisdiction in that, having considered a fair and equitable treatment or
other claim, when it came to considering the expropriation claim, the Tribunal would still have to
determine whether Slager had a proprietary right to a new licence. It is because the applicable
Treaties have such narrow grants of jurisdiction that the issue becomes so prominent at the

jurisdictional stage.

4° The same limitation does not apply to the provision in the respective Treaties for the arbitration of

disputes between the Contracting States, which extends respectively to “[a]ny dispute between the
Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of the present Agreement”: Art. 9
Netherlands BIT; or “[d]isputes between Contracting Parties regarding the interpretation or application of
the provisions of this Agreement”: Art. 9(1) Switzerland BIT.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

As a result, this Tribunal is only empowered by the instrument of consent concluded by the
Contracting States to decide a dispute between the Parties if and to the extent that it is satisfied
that the dispute concerns expropriation of the investment. Otherwise it is incompetent to
proceed and must dismiss the Claimants’ claim. It follows that any decision on this question
cannot have any effect on any other claims that Claimants or any other person or state may have

in relation to the matters that form the subject of the present dispute in any other forum.

B. Matters already decided

Although the written and oral pleadings of the Parties have ranged widely over numerous
detailed issues, the Tribunal's decision-making task on the present challenge to its jurisdiction is
focused by (1) the matters that it has already decided as a result of its Rule 41(5) Decision and its
Bifurcation Decision; and (2) the matters that are common ground between the Parties.
Accordingly, the Tribunal will set out the material aspects of each of these before identifying the

issues still in dispute on which its present decision must rest.

1. Jurisdiction limited ratione voluntatis to expropriation

In the first place, the Tribunal has determined in its Rule 41(5) Decision that its jurisdiction is
limited to claims of expropriation. To be sure, it considered that such claims might potentially be
advanced under customary international law as well as in accordance with the Treaties. But
nothing is said by the Parties to turn upon this distinction for the purpose of the present
challenge to jurisdiction. The Non-Expropriation Claims that had been originally advanced by
Claimants (including claims for breach of the treaty standards of fair and equitable treatment;
protection against discrimination; failure to observe obligations and the claim of breach of the
international minimum standard of treatment of foreign investors) fall outside the jurisdiction of

this Tribunal, without prejudice to any merit that those claims may have in another forum.

2. Jurisdiction limited ratione materiae to an investment

In the second place, the Tribunal has held in its Bifurcation Decision that this requires it to

determine:””

[...] whether, and if so which investments of Claimants are capable of giving rise
to their expropriation claim. This is so because, if Respondent’s jurisdiction
objection were to be upheld, the consequence would be that the Tribunal would
have no jurisdiction over the present case as a whole. Both Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention and the scope of the protection from expropriation found in

**” Bifurcation Decision, [43].

151.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

each of the Treaties are limited to ‘investments’ (in the latter case as therein
defined). But the same point is equally valid were the Tribunal to deny
Respondent’s objection. In that event, the Tribunal would need to determine the
nature and incidents of the rights held by Claimants that may be considered as
investments capable of enjoying the protection of international law against
expropriation before deciding whether Respondent’s conduct had in fact caused
any such expropriation. This would be so whether the proceedings were
bifurcated or joined.

3. Law applicable to jurisdictional issue

In the third place, the Tribunal has also decided that the determination of the jurisdictional issue

before it requires in turn reference to each of Hungarian law and public international law:*“*

[T]he existence and nature of any such rights must be determined in the first
instance by reference to Hungarian law, before the Tribunal proceeds to decide
whether any such rights can constitute investments capable of giving rise to a
claim for expropriation for the purpose of its jurisdiction under the Treaties and
the ICSID Convention. That is the basis upon which Claimants plead their case.
Respondent submits the same. The Tribunal agrees.”

It is for this reason that the Tribunal formulated the questions for determination as a preliminary

matter as:

(a) What rights, if any, did Claimants have under Hungarian law in 2009 in respect
of the renewal of their broadcasting licence for any period after 18 November
2009;

(b) To what extent, if at all, did those rights constitute an investment for the
purpose of the jurisdiction of the Centre under Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention and an investment capable of giving rise to a claim for expropriation
within the competence of this Tribunal under the Treaties; and,

(c) Does the present dispute arise directly out of such investment for the purpose
of Article 25?

4. Standard of proof on jurisdictional issue

These questions go to jurisdiction and must therefore be finally determined by the Tribunal, not

decided on a prima facie basis. The Tribunal so held,”*° citing Judge Higgins in her Separate

Opinion in the International Court of Justice in Oi! Platforms, when she said:?*

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

Where the Court has to decide, on the basis of a treaty whose application and
interpretation is contested, whether it has jurisdiction, that decision must be
definitive [...]. It does not suffice, in the making of this definitive decision, for the
Court to decide that it has heard claims relating to the various articles that are
“arguable questions” or that are “bona fide questions of interpretation” [...].

 

The same point was made in the investment arbitration context by the Tribunal in UPS v Canada

when it held:”*

Any ruling about the legal meaning of the jurisdictional provision, for instance
about its outer limits, is binding on the parties.

The Parties do not dispute the Tribunal’s holding to this effect, nor that it is empowered to make

such a determination at this preliminary stage.’?

C. Matters agreed between the Parties

The Tribunal’s task is further assisted by the common ground between the Parties. These
matters have already been identified earlier in this Award and may conveniently be summarised

here in the following points.

Significantly, both Parties accept that Claimants had an investment by way of its shares in Slager
Radio for 12 years from 1997 until 18 November 2009, which qualified for protection under the
Treaties.“ They also accept that that investment was not expropriated prior to expiry of

broadcasting licence on 18 November 2009.

It follows that, unless the Claimants have rights under Hungarian law in respect of the period
after 18 November 2009, they have no claim for expropriation. The question is what rights to
renewal; what rights survive termination; what tangible or intangible assets investor retains. This

last point was confirmed by the Claimants’ answer to the Tribunal’s hypothetical question: ‘If the

confirm, Slager’s rights under the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement, the company’s principal asset, definitely

which is the subject of the present arbitration.”); Counter-Memorial, [56]-[57], [59] (“Hungary does not -

the Tribunal is a dispute arising directly out of that investment.” See also Rejoinder, [138].

investor were the holder of an oil concession granted by a state for a period of 30 years where
there was no right of renewal provided under the concession contract or under the general law
of the host state, would the investor have any right capable of giving rise to a claim of
expropriation after the expiry of the 30-year period?’ Claimants’ answer to this question in oral

argument was:°°

Now, this is the Tribunal’s hypothetical, and as stated, and without more, the
answer would be no. After the 30-year period, there would be no contractual
rights capable of expropriation. But in this hypothetical, we don’t know what
rights might survive termination of the Contract, what rights the investor might
have held in respect of any new tender or what are the tangible or intangible
assets the investor might have held.

Finally, both Parties agree that ‘as a general matter of both international and Hungarian law
contractual rights are capable of being expropriated.’** This last point is unexceptional in itself.
But, given its significance for the issues presented for decision in the instant case, it requires

some elucidation from the Tribunal.

D. Rights capable of expropriation

Claimants assert claims of expropriation derived from three legal sources:

(a) Article 4 of the Netherlands BIT, which provides that ‘[nJeither Contracting
Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or indirectly, investors of the
other Contracting Party of their investments [...]’;

(b) Article 6 of the Switzerland BIT (headed ‘Expropriation and compensation’),
which provides that ‘[nJeither of the Contracting Parties shall take, either
directly or indirectly measures of expropriation, nationalization or any other
measure having the same nature or the same effect against investments
belonging to investors of the other Contracting Party [...]’; and,

(c) The customary international law protection against ‘expropriation without
compensation of Claimants’ investments’.”*”

In view of the fact that the only cause of action within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is that of
expropriation, Claimants must have held a property right of which they have been deprived. This
follows from the ordinary meaning of the term.” The Oxford English Dictionary defines

‘expropriate’ as ‘(of the state or an authority) take (property) from its owner for public use or

benefit’/‘dispossess (someone) of property’. Its origin is from the medieval Latin expropriat-
‘taken from the owner’, from the verb expropriare, from ex- ‘out, from’ + proprium ‘property’,

neuter singular of proprius ‘own’.

The Tribunal in Waste Management II made the same point when it held that the object of

expropriation is the property of the claimant:*°°

An indirect expropriation is still a taking of property. By contrast where a
measure tantamount to an expropriation is alleged, there may have been no
actual transfer, taking or loss of property by any person or entity, but rather an
effect on property which makes formal distinctions of ownership irrelevant.

The need to identify a proprietary interest that has been taken is confirmed by the definition of
‘investment’ in the Treaties. In each case, the Treaty refers compendiously to ‘every kind of

asset[s]’.* The Oxford English Dictionary definition of ‘asset’ is:

(usually assets) an item of property owned by a person or company, regarded as
having value and available to meet debts, commitments or legacies.

The definitions in the Treaties go on to provide particular examples of types of property or rights

that may constitute an asset for this purpose. But these examples are not exhaustive.

In order to determine whether an investor/claimant holds property or assets capable of
constituting an investment it is necessary in the first place to refer to host State law.” Public

international law does not create property rights. Rather, it accords certain protections to

property rights created according to municipal law. As the EnCana Tribunal put it:*°

[Flor there to have been an expropriation of an investment or return (in a
situation involving legal rights or claims as distinct from the seizure of physical
assets) the rights affected must exist under the law which creates them [...]

There is no doubt, as the Treaty definitions emphasise, that the notion of property or assets is

not to be narrowly circumscribed. For this reason, tribunals have rejected a restriction to

tangible property, emphasising that expropriation may equally protect intangible property.”® So,
too, tribunals have held that the rights protected from expropriation as not limited to rights in
rem.”™ This is confirmed by the Treaties which include within their definition of assets qualifying
as investments numerous other rights in addition to ‘movable and immovable property as well as
any other rights in rem’.”® This is unsurprising, since the definition of investment must apply
compendiously to assets created under the law of the different municipal legal systems of the
Contracting States. It is not to be circumscribed by technical distinctions that may have a

different import under different municipal legal systems. The test is substantive, not technical.

A right conferred by contract may therefore constitute an asset for this purpose. Article 1(2)(e)

of the Swiss BIT expressly so states. The position is in any event well established in customary

international law,” and has been followed by investment arbitral tribunals.”°”

But it is important to emphasise that the protection from expropriation in relation to rights
conferred under contract still requires identification of a property interest or asset held by the

claimant. As the Iran-US Claims Tribunal put it in Amoco:?®

Expropriation, which can be defined as a compulsory transfer of property rights,
may extend to any right which can be the object of a commercial transaction,
i.e., freely sold and bought, and thus has a monetary value. [...] It is because
Amoco's interests under the Khemco Agreement have such an economic value
that the nullification of those interests by the Single Article Act can be
considered as a nationalization.

The need to identify a property right or asset with commercial value not only equates with the
basic concept of expropriation. It also aligns with the critically important distinction between
rights protected by international law and contractual rights under municipal law. In its full

analysis of the issue in Waste Management II, the Tribunal distinguished between cases in which

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

the claim of expropriation of contractual rights was ancillary to a claim of expropriation of other
property and ‘the much smaller group of cases where the only right affected is incorporeal’. As

to the latter, it said:?©

[..] these come closest to the present claim of contractual non-performance.
L..] In such cases, simply to assert that “property rights are created under and by
virtue of a contract” is not sufficient.” The mere non-performance of a
contractual obligation is not to be equated with a taking of property, nor (unless
accompanied by other elements) is it tantamount to expropriation. [...]

The Tribunal concludes that it is one thing to expropriate a right under a contract
and another to fail to comply with the contract. Non-compliance by a
government with contractual obligations is not the same thing as, or equivalent
or tantamount to, an expropriation.

167. Moreover, such an interpretation also accords with the separate and distinct function of the
protection against expropriation as compared to the other protections included within the

framework of the wider investment treaty. Thus:

(a) Both Treaties provide for the ‘fair and equitable treatment’ of investments.”

This protection is designed to ensure that investments receive due process from
the host State’s administrative authorities and courts. That provision would not
serve a useful and distinct function if procedural rights were treated as assets of

the investor protected by the expropriation clause;

(b

The Netherlands BIT specifically provides that ‘[e]Jach Contracting Party shall
observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of
investors of the other Contracting Party.” Such a requirement to observe
undertakings generally would be unnecessary if all undertakings, whether
contractual, unilateral or under the general municipal law, were treated as

assets subject to protection under the expropriation clause;

extension, sale and, should it so happen, liquidation of such investments’.?” A
similar provision afforded the claimant a good cause of action in Lemire v
Ukraine in relation to the award of radio broadcasting licences.’ But the
Tribunal in that case emphasised the importance to its decision of the fact that
the claim was brought for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard,

and not for expropriation.””°

It also follows from the basic notion that an expropriation clause seeks to protect an investor
from deprivation of his property that the property right or asset must have vested (directly or
indirectly) in the claimant for him to seek redress. This has been recognised by many tribunals,

for example:

(a) In Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v United Mexican States,’”°

the Tribunal rejected
an expropriation claim because ‘the Claimant never really possessed a “right”

[under Mexican law] to obtain tax rebates upon exportation of cigarettes.’

(b) In Generation Ukraine v Ukraine,”

the Tribunal noted that since ‘expropriation
concerns interference with in rights in property, it is important to be meticulous
in identifying the rights duly held by the Claimant at the particular moment
when the alleged expropriation occurred.’ The Tribunal went on to hold that in
respect of a claimed right to use land, there ‘cannot be an expropriation of

something to which the Claimant never had a legitimate claim.’””°

In Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan*”?,

(

the Tribunal noted that the ‘first step in assessing the existence of an

the international market because this was “only a potential interest that may or
may not materialize” and was not therefore covered by the treaty protection

from expropriation.

(e) In Crompton (Chemtura) Corporation v Canada,” the Tribunal held that, when
analysing an expropriation claim, the first step was to determine ‘whether there
was an investment capable of being expropriated.’

(f) In Apotex v United States of America,” the Tribunal rejected claimant’s

argument that it had made an investment in the United States by applying for
regulatory approval for a drug that it claimed it would have been granted but
for Respondent’s alleged breaches. The Tribunal held “the critical enquiry must
be as to the nature of the alleged ‘property’ as at the date of the alleged breach

- not at some future point.””*

?*4 the Tribunal found that the ‘Claimant

(g) In Swisslion DOO Skopje v Macedonia,
has not proven the juridical fact on which the second limb of its expropriation
claim is based, i.e., that it had a clear right to recover the purchase price [of a
share purchase and sale agreement that had been terminated] in that
proceeding such that the court’s failure to so order constituted an

expropriation.’

169. Pausing at this point in the analysis, the Tribunal summarises the legal position under
international law in the following way: the loss of a right conferred by contract may be capable
of giving rise to a claim of expropriation but only if it gives rise to an asset owned by the claimant
to which a monetary value may be ascribed. The claimant must own the asset at the date of the
alleged breach. It is the asset itself - the property interest or chose in action - and not its

contractual source that is the subject of the expropriation claim. Contractual or other rights

accorded to the investor under host state law that do not meet this test will not give rise to a

claim of expropriation.

Thus, when applied to the facts of this case, the legal test for an investment capable of giving rise
to a claim for expropriation within the competence of the Tribunal (the question posited as issue

(b) in its list of issues for preliminary determination”

) enables the Tribunal to undertake a more
focused enquiry under issue (a) into the rights of Claimants, through their wholly-owned
subsidiary Slager under Hungarian law in 2009 in respect of the renewal (or fresh grant) of their
broadcasting licence.”*° The only question that the Tribunal must decide is whether Claimants
held, prior to expiry of Slager’s broadcasting licence on 18 November 2009, contractual rights
capable of constituting property or assets under Hungarian law relating to the grant of a new

broadcasting licence.”*”

The Tribunal must decide this question finally at the jurisdictional stage on the balance of
probabilities. The Claimants bear the burden of proof. If the Claimants' burden of proving
ownership of the claim is not met, the Respondent has no burden to establish the validity of its

jurisdictional defences. As the tribunal held in Saipem v Bangladesh:

In accordance with accepted international practice (and generally also with
national practice), a party bears the burden of proving the facts it asserts. For
instance, an ICSID tribunal held that the Claimant had to satisfy the burden of
proof required at the jurisdictional phase and make a prima facie showing of
Treaty breaches.

This passage touches upon two types of jurisdictional proof. The first relates to questions of fact
that must be definitively determined at the jurisdictional stage. The second involves questions of
fact that go to the merits, which the Tribunal must ordinarily not prejudge, unless they are
plainly without foundation. This latter question necessarily involves assessing whether the
alleged conduct of the Respondent is capable of constituting a breach of the substantive
protections of the investment treaty so as to fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal ratione

materiae but this has to be determined on a prima facie basis only.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

In the context of the present case, the Claimants bear the burden of proving that they owned an
investment capable of expropriation. This task lies fully within the ambit of the jurisdictional
phase. This burden is to be contrasted with the need to establish on a prima facie basis at the
jurisdictional phase that the Respondent breached the treaty. This question is based on whether
the alleged unlawful conduct giving rise to the treaty breach—if it can be established in the

merits phase—is capable of falling within the treaty provisions invoked.”

Issues that are essential to establish jurisdiction, such as the existence or ownership of a covered
investment, must be dealt with decisively in the jurisdictional phase. The Tribunal in Phoenix

Action Ltd v Czech Republic articulated accepted practice when it observed:

[W]hen a particular circumstance constitutes a critical element for the
establishment of jurisdiction itself, such fact must be proven, and the Tribunal
must take a decision thereon when ruling on its jurisdiction. In our case, this
means that the Tribunal must ascertain that the prerequisites for its jurisdiction
are fulfilled, and that the facts on which its jurisdiction can be based are proven.

Where the Tribunal is presented with a question of municipal law essential to the issues raised
by the Parties for its decision, the Tribunal, whilst retaining its independent powers of
assessment and decision, must seek to determine the content of the applicable law in

accordance with evidence presented to it as to the content of the law and the manner in which

the law would be understood and applied by the municipal courts.”

This is not to say that decisions of municipal courts arising directly out of the same set of facts
will be necessarily dispositive of the question before an international tribunal. The tribunal
retains its independent power to judge the probative value of evidence placed before it,
including evidence of municipal law. **? But nevertheless, as Claimants accepted, 7
determinations of municipal courts as to the content of the municipal laws that they are

mandated to apply are likely to be of great help to an international tribunal.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

177. With these considerations in mind, it is now possible to proceed to an analysis of the proprietary
rights under Hungarian law alleged by Claimants to give rise to their claim of expropriation in

respect of the 2009 tender.

E. Legal characteristics of proprietary rights under Hungarian law

178. The evidence presented to the Tribunal supports the proposition that Hungarian law recognises

a broad category of rights as proprietary, which are not limited to rights in rem. Respondent's

Hungarian law experts accepted as much in opining that:”**

85. Hungarian law creates a wide array of rights and obligations set forth in
different sources of laws, with the Hungarian Constitution reigning supreme.
However, not all these rights are “proprietary”, in the sense that they are
capable of being owned and alienated by the entitled person (for instance,
through sale, transfer, inheritance, etc.).

86. Hungarian law recognises two categories of rights as having this
“proprietary” character. The first one includes rights in rem, exercisable over
tangible moveable and immovable objects and regulated in Part Ill of the
Hungarian Civil Code. The second is known as “rights representing assets”
(“vagyoni értékdi jogok”).

87. The concept of “rights representing assets” is used to distinguish such rights
from other rights and freedoms that cannot be owned or alienated and cannot
form part of an estate. These can include claims under contracts, licenses, etc.
The Constitutional Court has confirmed that “rights representing assets” enjoy
the same constitutional protection as rights in rem.

88. The concept of “rights representing assets” is also used by Act C of 2000 on
accounting (the “Accounting Law”) which regulates their accounting treatment
as a form of asset: “under intangible assets, [rights representing assets] shall
include those acquired rights which are not related to real property. This
includes, in particular, leases, rights of use, trusteeship, rights of utilization of
intellectual products, brand names, licenses, furthermore, concessions, gaming
rights, and other rights which are not related to immovables.”

179. This view is supported by the decision of the Hungarian Constitutional Court which confirmed:*°>

Article 13(1) of the Constitution sets forth the principle of protection of the right
to property. a) Under the Constitutional Court’s case law, the right to property is
protected by the Constitution as a fundamental right [Constitutional Court
decision no. 7/1991. (Il. 28.), ABH 1991, 22, 25.]. Constitutional Court decision
no. 17/1992. (Ill. 30.) provided that the constitutional protection of property
rights covers not only things, as determined by civil law, but also rights
representing assets (ABH 1992, 104, 108.). Under Article 2(3) of the [the Act
under constitutional review] an operating license is a right representing assets

which is attached to a person and which, under certain conditions determined
by law, can be transferred and continue. Accordingly, the constitutional
protection of right to property also protects an operating license.

The Tribunal sought clarification from the Parties as to whether it is necessary under Hungarian
law for a right to be proprietary for it to capable of being sold or alienated, and, if so, on what
authority on the record.”%° Respondent maintained that the essential characteristic of a
proprietary right is that it is capable of being sold or alienated, whilst accepting that the right did
not lose this characteristic if the owner were under contractual or other restriction that

prevented its actual sale.”””

Claimants pointed out in oral pleading that rights did not need to be capable of being sold or
alienated independently to be capable of being proprietary, giving the example of the statutory

right of pre-emption of the co-owner of property or the goodwill of a company.”*

Thus far the propositions advanced by the Parties are consistent with each other and with the
formulation of the Constitutional Court. That is to say: a property right is one capable of being
owned and transferred to another. It does not lose that characteristic because it cannot be
transferred independently or because contractual or other legal conditions limit its

transferability.

But counsel for Claimants went further and submitted that, as a matter of Hungarian law, all
rights to be vindicated in a civil lawsuit must be either proprietary or inherent. Since the category
of inherent rights was limited to those that attach to the person by reason of his existence as
such (such as the right to privacy), it followed, he submitted, that all other rights are proprietary,
including contractual or non-contractual obligations relating to goods.” He cited as authority for
this proposition section 2(1) of the Civil Code and the decisions of the Hungarian courts in the

Slager litigation.

The Tribunal notes that this proposition is not advanced in any of the three reports submitted by
Dr Molnar, Claimant's expert on Hungarian law, whether in response to the passage cited above

from Respondent's experts or otherwise.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

The Tribunal has reviewed the authorities relied upon by Claimants itself and is satisfied that
they do not stand for so broad a concept of proprietary rights. Section 2(1) of the Civil Code (in

the English translation agreed between the Parties*”) provides:

‘This Act shall protect the property rights, inherent rights, and lawful interests of
all persons.’

It will be immediately observed that this over-arching statement extends not just to property

rights and inherent rights, but also to the ‘awful interests of all persons’.

The Code does not offer a definition of ‘property rights’. It is divided into five Parts: (One)
Introduction; (Two) Persons; (Three) Ownership; (Four) Obligations; and (Five) Succession. Part
Three on Ownership opens with a provision (section 94) on the objects of ownership, which

provides:

(1) There may be ownership of all things which are capable of appropriation.***

(2) Unless otherwise provided by law, the provisions pertaining to ownership
shall duly apply to money and securities as well as to natural resources that can
be utilized in the same way as things.

A separate Part (Four) deals with Obligations. It is that Part which includes in its Title | the
provisions on Contracts. This Title includes a number of references to contractual rights.*” The
Tribunal's preliminary conclusion from this reference to the Code is that Hungarian law
recognises substantive civil rights, enforceable in the courts, other than proprietary rights.

Included in this category of other civil rights are those enforceable by contract.

This view is confirmed by the approach of the Hungarian courts in the Sidger proceedings relied
upon by Claimants.* In these proceedings, Slager sought to challenge the 2009 Tender
conducted by ORTT. A preliminary question for the Metropolitan Court was the legal basis for

the claim. The Court held:°*

Pursuant to the Act, Defendant | [ORTT] acts in the tender proceedings and the
legal relationship [...] created by the broadcasting agreement in part as an
administrative authority and in part as a subject of civil law. The Act expressly

defines in which cases Defendant | acts as an administrative authority and it only
regulates within the confines of this proceeding the opportunities of the bidder
to obtain remedies. The Act does not contain any provisions on the protection
measures available to the bidder out of these confines, therefore legal
protection of the bidder can be enforced in the courts of law, in part pursuant to
Section 2(1) and 7 (1) of the Civil Code, and in part pursuant to Section 87 of the
General Terms of Tender (applicable in the tender proceeding by the
authorization of Act | of 1996) and Section 1.3.2. of the Call For Tender, and the
general rules of the Code of Civil Procedure apply.

Section 7(1) of the Code provides:**

Each and every government agency shall be obliged to protect the rights
provided by law. Unless otherwise stipulated by law, those rights shall be
enforced in the court of law.

The Court's finding that Slager’s rights in the tender could be enforced under the Civil Code did
not, however, entail a finding that such rights were proprietary. On the contrary, the Court
proceeded on the basis that the plaintiff was entitled to declaratory relief that the terms of the

GTT had not been complied with. It held:*°”

The right of the Plaintiff to be protected is that in a compulsory tender
proceeding prescribed by law for the selection of the person of the broadcaster,
the person of the broadcaster be selected in compliance with the provisions of
law, from among those who submitted a valid bid.

[T]he declaration that Defendant | should not have concluded the agreement
with Defendant II is appropriate for the protection of the rights of the Plaintiff,
as based on this, Defendant | shall conduct the administrative proceeding and
select the winner by applying tendering terms in correspondence with the legal
provisions [...]

The Court of Appeals took the same view, holding that the plaintiff had a ‘direct interest’ which
was the ‘competition with equal chances for all participants’ constituted by the Media Law and
the GTT. Such a right was limited to a declaration of the violation of the rules of the tender
procedure and the nullity of any agreement concluded in breach of those rules. The plaintiff was

held to have no ‘substantive right for the conclusion of the agreement.’*°°

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

There is no trace in the judgments of either the Metropolitan Court or the Court of Appeals of a
finding that Hungarian law treats all rights other than inherent rights as proprietary, nor of any
reference to the provisions of the Civil Code dealing with ownership of property. Rather, the
Courts proceed on the basis that the participant in a public tender has a lawful interest in
securing compliance with the provisions of the law and the terms of the tender. This is
actionable by way of declaratory relief through the Civil Courts by virtue of the general provision
of Article 2(1) (which refers to ‘the lawful interests of all persons’) and the confirmation in Article
7(1) that the right to vindicate such an interest applies equally to the obligations of government
agencies ‘to protect the rights provided by law.’ These findings are consistent with the view
already arrived at by the Tribunal in construction of the Civil Code, namely that it protects a
broad range of legal rights, including contractual rights, but that not all of these constitute

property rights.

Thus, the Tribunal concludes that the category of proprietary rights under Hungarian law is
undoubtedly broad enough to include intangible assets as well as movable and immovable
property stricto sensu, it is nevertheless an essential attribute of a proprietary right that it be an

asset capable of ownership, valuation and alienation.

F. Alleged sources of Claimants’ proprietary rights

Claimants allege two sources of proprietary rights:

(a) Rights in respect of the 2009 tender acquired by them in or under the 1997

Broadcasting Agreement”; and

(b) Rights acquired by them by virtue of their participation as a bidder in the 2009
Tender Bid.

It is necessary to analyse each of these sources of rights separately.

1. 1997 Broadcasting Agreement

It is common ground between the Parties that the Broadcasting Right created by the
Broadcasting Agreement was a ‘right representing assets’ and therefore protected by the
Hungarian law of property.*”° In this connection, and as noted above, both Parties accept that

Claimants had an investment by way of its shares in Slager Radid for 12 years from 1997 until

18 November 2009, which qualified for protection under the Treaties.*"* The issue in the present
case is a more specific one: what proprietary rights, if any, did Claimants acquire thereby in

respect of any period after 18 November 2009?
Claimants put their case in this regard in two ways:

First, they say generally that the Broadcasting Agreement contained or
incorporated valuable provisions for Claimants’ benefit in relation to the
subsequent period, notably the right to a subsequent tender in accordance with
the provisions of the GTT; and,

Second, they claim that, by virtue of the incorporation of the GTT into the
Broadcasting Agreement, they obtained in particular the right to an ‘incumbent
advantage’ on any subsequent tender, which was a valuable asset of a
proprietary character, which was taken from them by the manner in which the
ORTT, as a Hungarian state agency, operated the 2009 Tender.

In order to assess this claim, it is necessary for the Tribunal to construe first the duration of the

Broadcasting Agreement. Section 2.3 provides:

The Broadcasting License shall commence from the 18th day of November, 1997
and is issued for seven (7) years, subject to the provisions of the present
Contract. For the renewal of the Broadcasting License, §107 of the Act shall be
applicable.

There are no other express provisions in 1997 Agreement as to renewal or the grant of further

broadcasting licences thereafter.
Section 107 of the Media Law, to which reference is made in section 2.3, provides:

(1) Broadcasting rights for television are valid for maximum ten years, and rights
for radio for maximum seven years, and may be renewed once upon expiry at
the broadcaster’s request, without inviting a tender, for an additional five years.
The request for renewal must be notified to the Board fourteen months prior to
expiry.

(2) In the absence of the reporting notification referred to in Subsection (1) or if
renewal cannot be awarded, the Board must publish an invitation to tender
twelve months prior to the expiry of the license.

(3) The license cannot be renewed if the right-holder violated the contract
repeatedly or seriously.

(4) The provisions relating to the award of rights must otherwise apply to the
procedure for the renewal of such rights.

*4t See above, [155].

198.

199.

200.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

Taken together the provisions of the Broadcasting Agreement and of section 107 of the Media
Law provide a clear structure as to the term of the radio broadcasting right granted by the

Broadcasting Agreement:

(a) The licensee obtains an initial term of seven years (in the present case from
18 November 1997 to 18 November 2004); and,

(b) Provided it has not violated the licence repeatedly or seriously, the licensee
may request a further five year extension, which ORTT may grant without
inviting a tender, provided that the request is made within the time specified,
i.e. fourteen months prior to expiry. In the present case, it is common ground
that this request for an extension was made and granted, thus extending the
licence to 18 November 2009.”

Thus far, there is no dispute between the Parties. But the experts on Hungarian law whose
reports were filed on behalf of each Party disagree as to the precise effect of section 107 of the
Media Law within the Broadcasting Agreement upon any subsequent tender for the period after

18 November 2009.*”* There are two sub-issues on which this disagreement centres:

(a) Whether the Broadcasting Agreement confers rights upon Claimants binding in
contract upon ORTT derived from the Media Law (and, in turn, from the GTT

promulgated thereunder); and,

(b) Whether section 107(2) in particular confers a right to renewal or re-tender 12
months prior to the expiry of the maximum twelve-year period under section

107(1) in respect of any subsequent period.

(a) Contractual incorporation of the Media Law

Dr Molnar, the expert called on behalf of Claimants, maintains that “[t]he 1997 Broadcasting
Agreement incorporated the regulatory framework governing Slager’s broadcasting right,
including the Media Law and the GTT and the 1997 Call for Tender.”*““ He relies for this purpose
in particular on section 3.2 of the Broadcasting Agreement, which (in the agreed translation of

the Parties) provides:

The Broadcaster undertakes to observe the provisions of the Act. The parties
hereby incorporate into the present Contract the provisions of the Act relating to

3” See Composition Agreement between ORTT and Slager, 5 December 2002, (C-117).

the Broadcasting Right and its exercise in effect at the time of the conclusion of
the Contract. The Broadcaster hereby expressly agrees to use the Broadcasting
Right during the full term of its validity in accordance with the provisions of the
Act incorporated into the Contract, whether they are repeated herein or not.

Dr Molnar opines that the reference in this provision to ‘the provisions of the Act relating to the
Broadcasting Right and its exercise’ are a reference to the provisions of Chapters II and VI of the
Media Law, which deal respectively with 'Principles and rules of broadcasting’ and ‘Broadcasting

Rights’.

Drs Kérmendy-Ekes and Lengyel, Respondent's experts, disagree. They maintain that section 3.2
‘does not incorporate the provisions of the 1996 Media Law except to impose obligations of
compliance upon the broadcaster.’** Further, they opine that ORTT was not competent to give a
commitment to leave the Media Law unchanged during the term of the Agreement.*”° That was

a question for Parliament and not the regulatory agency.

The Tribunal finds that the effect of section 3.2 was, as its terms provide, to ‘incorporate into the
present Contract the provisions of the Act relating to the Broadcasting Right and its exercise in
effect at the time of the conclusion of the Contract.’ The effect of incorporation is that the
provisions referred to become terms of the Contract between the Parties, just as if they had
been written out in full. No doubt one consequence of such incorporation was to impose
obligations upon the broadcaster. Yet it is too narrow a reading of the section to limit its effect in
this way. That is not what the plain words of the quoted sentence provide. Moreover, such a
limited unilateral effect would have been unnecessary. Hungarian law bound Slager in any event
in its performance of the Broadcasting Right. Rather, the effect of section 3.2 was to give

bilateral contractual effect to the incorporated statutory provisions.

The Tribunal does not consider that this was beyond ORTT’s competence. The provision did not
bind the Hungarian Parliament in a manner that precluded subsequent amendments to the
Media Law during the pendency of the Licence. Rather, it merely ensured that, as between
Slager and ORTT, the contractual framework was stabilised as at the time of the conclusion of
the Contract. Hungarian law makes specific provision for the effect of any subsequent changes in
the law upon parties’ contractual rights and duties. Section 226(2) of the Civil Code provides (in a

manner that is unexceptional in the Civil Law):

Legal regulations can amend the content of contracts that have been concluded
prior to the date on which the legal regulations enter into force only under
special circumstances. If the amended content of a contract injures any
substantial and rightful interest of any of the parties, the party so affected shall
be entitled to request the court to amend the contract, or, unless otherwise
provided by legal regulation, the party shall be entitled to rescind from the
contract.

The effect, then, of such incorporation in the present case is that the provisions of Chapter VI of
the Media Law, which relate to the Broadcasting Right and its exercise, form contractual terms of
the Broadcasting Agreement. Chapter VI includes provisions relating to the publication by ORTT
of both General Tender Conditions*”’ and Invitations to Tender,*"* as well as the term of rights

provision (section 107).

But the fact that these provisions form part of the Broadcasting Agreement during its term does
not in itself address the second question, which is whether the Agreement contains obligations

assumed by ORTT in respect of any period after 18 November 2009.

(b) Application of Broadcasting Agreement to period after 18 November 2009

The dispute between the Parties on the application of the Agreement to the period after
18 November 2009 hinges on the proper construction of section 107(2) of the Media Law. The
question is whether this section imposes upon the ORTT an obligation to issue a further call for
tenders twelve months before the end of the maximum period of twelve years of the
Broadcasting Licence granted and renewed under section 107(1). If it does, Claimants submit
that they were, by virtue of the incorporation of that section into the Broadcasting Agreement,
contractually entitled to the conduct of a further tender in 2009 upon the same terms as applied
in 1997. If it does not, then Claimants’ contractual rights under the 1997 Broadcasting
Agreement would cease on 18 November 2009. Any rights Claimants might then have in respect

of the 2009 Tender would have to be derived from another source.

Dr Molnar states in his first report that section 107 contemplates two types of renewals: (a) that
provided under section 107(1) (a renewal without re-tender for an additional five years) and (b)
“where the first type of renewal was already awarded, or ‘cannot be awarded’ a renewal
conducted through a tender published by ORTT 12 months before the expiration of the

broadcasting agreement (Section 107(2)).”*“° Thus, he considers that section 107 applies not only

31” Title 3, sub-section 91 — 94.

to the “singular permitted renewal of broadcasting rights without tender”*”° but also “to the re-
tendering of the existing broadcasting right by holding a competitive tender, and signing a new

contract with the winner.””*

Drs Kérmendy-Ekes and Lengyel disagree. They opine that section 107(2) only applies to
circumstances in which the first renewal is not sought or granted. At the end of maximum
twelve-year period, they argue that the ORTT had a complete discretion as to whether to call a
tender at all.°” If it did so, then the applicable provision of the Media Law would be section 41
(the general power of the Board to call for tenders for radio frequencies) and not section 107(2).
Dr Molnar accepts in reply that section 41 serves as the legal basis for the call for tenders, but
maintains that section 107(2) complements section 41 because it ‘regulates the timing but does

not affect the statutory basis for calling the tender itself.’?7*

The experts called by both Parties referred to discussions within the ORTT Board and to ORTT
practice in support of their respective positions, drawing opposing conclusions from this
practice. But, in the end, the Tribunal finds that this question is simply a question of construction

of the statutory provision. That is to say: it is a question of law that the Tribunal must decide.

In the Tribunal’s view, section 107(2) does not apply in respect of a period beyond the maximum
licence period of twelve years provided under section 107(1). It does not in particular impose an
obligation upon the ORTT Board to issue a call for tenders twelve months prior to the expiry of
the twelve-year period. Rather, section 107(2) makes provision only for the position in the event
that there is to be no renewal after the first seven years of a broadcasting licence. This may be
so, either because the licencee has failed to notify the Board fourteen months prior to the expiry
of the first seven year period that it seeks a renewal under sub-section (1); or because it has
failed to meet the conditions for renewal by repeated or serious violations of the contract under
sub-section (3). In either or those events, the Board is under an obligation under sub-section (2)
to publish an invitation to tender twelve months before the expiry of the first licence period.
Such a call for tenders would have to be issued at the outset of Year 7 in respect of the period

from the beginning of Year 8.

The Tribunal is unable to read section 107(2) as having any application to a situation in which the
renewal provided under section 107(1) has been already granted without tender and the period

under contemplation is therefore beyond the maximum twelve-years there provided. Section
107 is the only section in Title 7 of the Media Law which is entitled ‘Term of Rights’. The section
is by its express terms concerned with specifying maximum periods for which Broadcasting
Rights are valid. Section 107(1) provides for only one renewal beyond the first maximum period
of seven years. That renewal is to be for a period of five years. In its express terms, the

Broadcasting Agreement is consistent with the law.

Dr Molnar had originally maintained that a new call for tenders in respect of a period beyond
twelve years is nevertheless a ‘type of renewal’. But this is not consistent with the language of
section 107(2), which speaks rather of ‘an invitation to tender’ which must be published ‘if
renewal cannot be awarded’.** Section 107(2) does not create a different type of renewal to
that provided under section 107(1). In his Third Report, Dr Molnar retreated somewhat from his
original formulation, maintaining simply that section 107(2) continued to impose an obligation
upon the Board to issue a new call for tenders in respect of the period after twelve years.*”° The
Tribunal considers that this gives a construction to the words ‘if a renewal cannot be awarded’
which is inconsistent with the function of sub-section (2) within the structure of section 107. As it
has already explained, this function is to provide for the situation at the end of the first seven-

year period in the event that the single renewal right is not applicable.

The Tribunal is fortified in this view by a consideration of the consequences that would apply in
the event that Claimants’ construction of the section were to be applied. Claimants maintain that
the obligation to issue a call for tenders in 2009 must be exercised on the basis of the
Contractual Framework applicable to the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement, including by
incorporation the Media Law, GTT and CFT in force in 1997. The Tribunal sought clarification of
this point in the course of oral argument. The President asked counsel for Claimants the

following question:?”°

As | understand the submission of the Claimant, the submission is that if the
ORTT were to have amended the General Terms for Tender such that different
terms applied in 2009 to those originally published in [199]7, Claimants’ position
is that Claimant would be entitled to relief contractually if those changes had
any material effect on their position vis-a-vis the original GTT in 1997?

MR. TRIANTAFILOU: Yes.

PRESIDENT McLACHLAN: What would be the position then, again, in seven years
thereafter? Would it still be the 1997 GTT that would apply to the Claimant?

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

MR. TRIANTAFILOU: As we noted yesterday, | think this is, of course, a matter of
fact. The question would be whether the new Broadcasting Agreement would
effect a similar incorporation of the GTT in effect at the time of the 2009 Tender.
So the '97 Broadcasting Agreement incorporated the GTT in effect at that time,
but, of course, the new Broadcasting Agreement would have to effect a similar
incorporation for the same GTT to apply in future tenders, and, in particular,
most likely a re-tendering because after the seven years, there is a renewal
pursuant to Section 107 of the Media Law.

We have observed that the draft Broadcasting Agreement annexed to the 2009
CFT contains an incorporation clause functionally identical to Section 3.2 of the
‘97 Agreement. So | guess this by a long way of saying that, in this case, the same
GTT would remain in effect for purposes of the winning bidder of the 2009
Tender until 2021 when presumably its Broadcasting Agreement plus renewal
would come to an end.

Although Claimants submitted in answer to the President’s second question that the ORTT could
promulgate a new GTT for the 2009 Tender, their answer to the first question necessarily entails
that, in their view, the ORTT was contractually bound vis-a-vis Slager by virtue of the 1997
Broadcasting Agreement to issue the Call for Tenders for the 2009 Tender on the same terms
(including the same terms as to renewal) as that provided in 1997. Any failure to do so would
expose ORTT to a claim for contractual remedies from Slager. The result would be that due
compliance by ORTT with its contractual obligations would result in a potentially perpetual
obligation to renew on 1997 terms. The Tribunal does not consider that this is at all consistent
with the limited term of the Broadcasting Right conferred by the Broadcasting Agreement and

the Media Law.

The Tribunal’s view that the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement did not generally impose upon ORTT
obligations in respect of the period after 18 November 2009 is corroborated by the Claimants’
own contemporaneous views as expressed to the regulatory authorities both in the United

States and in Hungary.

Thus, in filing disclosure forms with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on
12 May 2008, 8 May 2009 and 9 October 2009 (ten days after the deadline for submitting bids in
the 2009 Tender), Emmis Corporation (the ultimate US holding company of two of the Claimants)

stated:””

Broadcast licenses in many foreign countries do not generally confer the same
renewal expectancy as U.S. radio stations broadcast licenses. For instance,
Hungarian broadcast law is silent as to the treatment of broadcast licenses after
the expiration of the first license renewal period. While we believe we have

reasonable prospects for securing additional extensions of our Hungarian
broadcast licenses after the expiration of our first license renewal period in
November 2009, we cannot assure that such extensions will be granted or that
the terms and conditions of such extensions will not have a material adverse
effect on our Hungarian operations.

Further, for accounting purposes Claimants did not attach a value to Slager’s broadcast licence
after November 2009. On the contrary, Emmis Corporation confirmed in the same US SEC filings

that:

The Company has definite-lived intangible assets recorded that continue to be
amortized in accordance with SFAS No. 142. These assets consist primarily of
foreign broadcast licenses, trademarks, customer lists and non-compete
agreements, all of which are amortized over the period of time the assets are
expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the Company’s future cash flows.
The cost of the broadcast license for Slager Radio is being amortized over the
five-year term of the license, which expires in November 2009.

Claimants submit that these statements of prudent accounting policy should not be taken as any
indication of Emmis’ lack of commitment to long-term investment in the Hungarian radio market
or lack of expectation of a long-term benefit from that investment.*” But the question for the
Tribunal is a different one. It is whether the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement conferred rights that
might constitute valuable intangible assets, capable of expropriation in respect of any period
after 18 November 2009. Claimants’ contemporaneous accounting treatment of the
Broadcasting Right confirms that it was indeed a valuable asset during the period of the licence
and its first renewal. But at the same time, both Emmis Corporation and Slager attributed a nil
value to that asset in respect of the period after 18 November 2009. This confirms the view that
the Tribunal has arrived at as a result of its own analysis of the rights conferred by the 1997

Broadcasting Agreement, interpreted in the light of the relevant provisions of Hungarian law.

Moreover Slager took the same position when it urged the Hungarian Parliament in 2008 to

amend the Media Law so as to provide for further renewal of its licence. It stated:*?°

As it is known, the broadcasting licenses of the two national commercial radio
licenses will expire in the second half of 2009 based on the broadcasting

confirmed in the accounts of Slager: Jonscher Report, [89].

agreements concluded with the [ORTT] in a manner that their extension is
currently not possible based on the currently effective provisions of Act | of 1996
(“Media Act”).

Thus, the Tribunal concludes that the 2007 Broadcasting Agreement conferred in general no
rights in respect of the period after 18 November 2009 constituting valuable assets capable of
expropriation. However, it remains to consider one specific right that Claimants submit they
acquired by virtue of being awarded the Broadcasting Right under the 1997 Broadcasting
Agreement and which they submit constituted a valuable asset in the 2009 Tender Bid. That is
the alleged right to an incumbent advantage. The question whether Claimants acquired this right

must be considered in the next section of this Award.

2. Alleged right to an incumbent advantage

Claimants’ right to an incumbent advantage is alleged to derive from section 65.3 of the GTT

which provides:

65.3.1 That bidder is advantaged, who has held a broadcasting right awarded in
tender for the frequency forming the subject-matter of the call for tender, if it
operates and broadcasts in accordance with its studio license and the Media Act.

65.3.2 ORTT evaluates at a disadvantage the bidder who holds the broadcasting
right for the frequency forming subject of the call for tenders but its operations
are not in compliance with its studio license and the Media Act.

Although much argument was devoted to the question whether the GTT was, or was not,
incorporated into the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement, the Tribunal considers that this issue is not
in the end dispositive of the issue before it. It has already found that the provisions of Chapter VI
of the Media Law that relate to the Broadcasting Right and its exercise were incorporated into
the Broadcasting Agreement. These provisions include the requirement upon the Board to

publish general terms of tender.**

There is no dispute that section 65.3 of the GTT did form part of the tender for the 1997
Broadcasting Right. Moreover the same provision was also included in the GTT for the 2009
Tender, since the GTT continued to apply to all tenders of broadcasting rights until the Media
Law was replaced in 2010 and was specifically incorporated into the Call for Tenders for the 2009

332

Tender.” Slager did submit a bid in the 2009 Tender. It was undoubtedly the bidder ‘who has

held a broadcasting right awarded in tender for the frequency forming the subject-matter of the

** Section 91.

352 9009 CFT, 20 July 2009, 1, (CA-6); Molnér I, [23];

226.

227.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

call for tender’.*” If, therefore, section 65.3 were applicable to the 2009 Tender, then Slager

would be the only bidder holding the advantage recognised under the section.

Thus, Claimants’ claim under this head does not depend solely upon their more general
submissions about the continuance of the rights under the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement.

Indeed the language of section 65.3.1 contemplates two distinct elements:
(a) The participation of the bidder in a current bid; and,

(b) The fact that this bidder had previously held a broadcasting right for the same

frequency, which right had been awarded in tender.

The advantage contemplated by section 65.3.1 therefore derives from current participation and

the prior holding of the right, not from a continuation of that right.

Respondent devotes some effort towards submitting that, even if section 65.3 applied, ORTT
would have been entitled to evaluate Slager at a disadvantage under section 65.3.2. It submits
that Slager conducted its operations in ways that were not in compliance with the Media Law,
and cites instances that it claims constituted repeated and serious breaches of the Law.*™ But
the Tribunal finds no evidence that such infringements of the Media Law as were committed by
Slager rose to a level of repeated or serious violations, such that it could be said to be conducting
its operations generally in a manner that was not compliant with the Law. On the contrary, it
accepts the evidence advanced by Claimants showing that ORTT as regulator had granted the
renewal of Slager’s licence in 2004; had settled its subsequent differences with Slager in 2007

and that it was not regarded as a delinquent operator in 2009.***

But this leaves the question whether Slager was in fact entitled ratione personae to the
incumbent advantage provided in section 65.3.1. The language of the section refers to a bidder
who ‘operates and broadcasts in accordance with its studio license and the Media Act.’*** It is
undisputed that Slager’s Broadcasting Right was not a ‘studio licence’. The question of

construction of section 65.3.1 is therefore whether that provision applies:

(a) only to tenders for the award of frequencies previously held by holders of

studio licences; or,

(b) generally to incumbent bidders on all frequencies, all of whom must comply

with the Media Law. In that event the reference to studio licences would have

to be regarded as ‘a mere anachronism’.*?”

228. Neither the GTT nor the Media Law defines ‘studio licence’. But the experts on Hungarian law
called by both Parties were agreed that this type of licence had been issued at a local or regional
level during the period prior to the entry into force of the Media Law, either for a fixed term or

with an indefinite duration.**

229. Specific provision is made for the treatment of such pre-existing studio licences in section 146 of

the Media Law, which provides:

(1) The holders of studio licenses issued prior to the time of this Act entering into
force for a fixed period may apply to the Board for the transformation of their
licenses into broadcasting contracts by 31 March 1996. Failure to observe this
deadline shall result in the forfeiture of the right and the license shall be
considered withdrawn. The Board may not conclude a contract with the
applicant if the studio does not perform broadcasting or does not perform
broadcasting in compliance with the studio license. The studio license shall be
withdrawn by resolution of the Board.

(2) The Board shall conclude the contract with the applicant for the term of the
studio license defined in the original license and in respect of the area of
reception defined therein, establishing the broadcasting fee, if the applicant
operates in accordance with the provisions contained in the studio license.

(3) The Board shall invite a tender in respect of the frequency (transmission
time) released through the withdrawal of a studio license, except if the
broadcaster refuses to consent under Subsection (3) of Section 100.

(4) Tenders shall be invited in respect of the utilization in accordance with this
Act of the frequencies used on the basis of the studio licenses issued prior to the
time of this Act entering into force for an indefinite period of time or with
reference to the time limit defined in this Act. The Board shall invite tenders in
respect of the frequencies used on the basis of studio licenses issued with
reference to the time limit defined in this Act within nine months, while in
respect of the frequencies used on the basis of studio licenses issued for an
indefinite period of time after one year, but within one-and-a-half years, at the
most. These deadlines shall be reckoned as of the time of this Act entering into
force. The studio licenses shall terminate at the date of the commencement of

broadcasting services provided on the basis of the broadcasting contract
concluded on the basis of the tender, at the latest.

(5) In the tenders defined in Subsections (3)-(4), the former operation of the
person entitled to broadcast on the basis of the studio license on the same
frequency shall be given priority in the course of the assessment process.

(6) The Board may conclude contracts with the companies existing at the time of
this Act entering into force without complying with the provisions contained in
Sections 85-88, Section 108 and Chapter VIII of this Act, subject to the condition
to alter their activity or transform their companies by 31 December 1996.

The transitional regime set out in section 146 makes provision for two different types of studio

licence:

(a) Fixed Period: The holders of fixed term studio licences could apply to the Board
within the stipulated window for the transformation of their studio licence into a
broadcasting contract of the same duration, provided that they were broadcasting

in compliance with their existing licence: section 146(1) — (2);

(b) Indefinite Period: The holders of indefinite term licences had to submit to a re-
tender within a stipulated period, but would ‘be given priority in the course of the

assessment process’: section 146(4) — (5).

In the Tribunal’s view, section 65.3 of the GTT can only be read as the ORTT’s implementation of
the requirements of section 146 of the Media Law. The ‘advantage’ accorded to a bidder under
section 65.3.1 of the GTT implements the requirement in section 146(5) of the Law to give that
bidder ‘priority’. Claimants’ expert opines that there is no necessary link between the two
provisions, pointing out that there is no equivalent in the Media Law of section 65.3.2 in the case
of the holders of studio licences of indefinite duration.**° But, in the Tribunal’s view, this
observation in no way affects the close relationship between the two provisions. The right to
transform fixed-term studio licences into broadcasting contracts without tender under section
146(1) had to be subject to an express qualification in cases where the incumbent had not
complied with the terms of the studio licence. Otherwise a delinquent incumbent could unjustly
benefit from rights under the new Law. But, in the case of a tender for an indefinite-term licence,
section 146(3) makes it clear that the incumbent must submit to a tender process under the
Board's tender conditions, which had yet to be promulgated. The requirement to accord the

incumbent ‘priority’ could not preclude the Board from promulgating tender conditions that

enabled it to take into account the question whether the incumbent had in fact operated in

accordance with its studio licence and the Law.

Claimants further submit that in practice the ORTT did accord an incumbent advantage in new

tenders of local or regional frequencies,”

although the experts disagreed as to the significance
of this practice.** The Tribunal derives little assistance from this evidence, since its function is to
construe and apply the applicable legal provisions, a task that is not determined by the practice

of the regulator.

The Board was empowered under section 91 of the Media Law to publish the GTT, defining,
under sub-section (2)(b) criteria for evaluation of the material conditions of the bid. Although by
section 92 the Board could have promulgated a different GTT for each of local, regional and
national broadcasting, in fact it did not. The GTT, as adopted, applied across these different
categories of broadcasting. But this does not mean that every provision in the GTT must be
applied in the case of every bid if the particular provision is, by its terms, inapplicable to the bid

in question.

Section 65.1 of the GTT permits the contracting authority to evaluate the bids according to the
criteria published in the Call for Tenders. The ORTT published the Call for Tenders in respect of
the 2009 Tender on 29 July 2009.” That Call accorded 10 points for Broadcasting Experience,
but stated expressly that “[i]n evaluating the Broadcasting Service Experience, it can not be

regarded as a disadvantage if the Bidder has non-national broadcasting service experience.”**

The Tribunal’s view, as a matter of law, that ORTT was not obliged to accord an incumbent
advantage to bidders outside the specific context of holders of studio licence is reinforced by the

conduct of Slager and the conclusions of the Hungarian courts at the time.

In its comments on the draft Call for Tenders, Slager made no reference to an incumbent
advantage under section 65.3.1. It confined itself to a general observation that the draft made
no distinction based on whether the broadcaster had demonstrated a long-term commitment in

344

the Hungarian market. In reply, ORTT had stated that:

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 Emmis et al. v Hungary

Observing the principles of neutrality of competition and equality of chances,
and in line with media policy considerations [ORTT] did not wish to favor either
old or new actors in the course of evaluating the bids.

Slager had previously sought to secure an extension to its licence by promoting an amendment
to the Media Law in Parliament. On 30 July 2009, the Hungarian Constitutional Court delivered
its judgment declaring unconstitutional the amending legislation of the Hungarian Parliament

that would have extended Slager's licence without re-tender.*”° The Court held:**°

Frequencies are, at present, public goods of high value and importance, the
owner of which is the state. [...] Because the number of frequencies reserved for
transmission limits the entry into the market, new players on the media market
bidding for frequencies are unable to enter the market in addition to those
already on the market. They can only replace those on the market. Therefore, in
a tender for analogue radio broadcasting right, the freedom of competition can
be interpreted such that until radio digitalization takes place, all privately-held,
profit-oriented undertakings must have an equal chance to bid for the two
national commercial radio frequencies if they comply with the conditions set
forth in the call for tender.

After the outcome of the bid had been announced, Slager challenged the decision before the
Hungarian Metropolitan Court inter alia on the basis of section 65.3. It argued that the ORTT
should have excluded non-national broadcasting experience. But the Court rejected that
argument, holding that, whilst section 65.3 was a mandatory part of the GTT, the ORTT was
entitled under section 65.2 to formulate other criteria and thus the extension to non-national

broadcasting experience was not a breach of the Media Law or the GTT.*””

In the Tribunal’s view, Claimants’ disclosures in the United States and their conduct in Hungary
prior to the Tender are consistent with the view that they knew that they did not have an
incumbent advantage in the 2009 Tender. On the contrary, an extension of their licence without
re-tendering by amendment to the Media Law had failed in the Constitutional Court on the basis
that it would undercut the basic objective of ensuring equality of treatment as between

incumbents and new bidders.*“*

As a result, the Tribunal finds that the provisions of section 65.3.1 of the GTT did not apply to

Slager in its bid in the 2009 Tender for a national radio frequency. The Tribunal therefore does

not need to decide whether the advantage set forth in that section is capable of being treated as

an asset of the incumbent constituting property capable of expropriation.

Nevertheless, Claimants do not put their claim of expropriation solely on the basis of the alleged
failure to apply the incumbent advantage. They also allege that, by participating in the 2009
Tender Bid, Claimants acquired other rights of a kind capable of expropriation. It is to this

alternative basis for the claim that the Tribunal must finally turn.

3. 2009 Tender Bid

Claimants submit that, by virtue of its participation in the 2009 Tender, Slager acquired the

following four additional rights:*?
(a) The right to a properly established tender procedure;
(b) The right to a timely tender;

(c) The right to a fair and objective tender evaluation in accordance with

transparent scoring criteria; and,

(d) The right not to compete against unqualified or improperly qualified bidders.

Claimants submit that these rights vested in Slager by virtue of its participation in the Tender.

They constituted a contract between Slager and the ortt.*°

Had these rights been respected,
Slager would have been entitled to be declared the winning bidder (because, on the facts of the
case, in Claimants’ view it would have been the only qualifying bidder) and thus would have been
entitled to the award of the 2009 Broadcasting Agreement.*” These rights were violated by
ORTT in their evaluation of the bids in a manner that extinguished the rights, and accordingly

these rights were expropriated.***

At this jurisdictional stage of its enquiry, the Tribunal is not of course concerned to determine
whether Respondent’s conduct breached the applicable standards. In respect of breach, it is
sufficient for Claimants to allege a prima facie case on the merits. Rather, the Tribunal is
concerned with a prior question, which must be decided as a question of jurisdiction. That is

whether the rights alleged constitute assets or property of the Claimants that are capable of

being expropriated.**

The Tribunal finds as a matter of Hungarian law, that, in issuing the Call for Tenders, ORTT was

obliged vis-a-vis all bidders to observe the conditions of the GTT as regards the tender

procedure. The Call for Tenders provided that:?*

The rules of the Media Act and the GTT must be applied to the tender procedure
carried out on the basis of the Call for Tenders. The definitions and requirements
used in the Call for Tenders must be interpreted in accordance with the Media
Act and the GTT.

The Metropolitan Court held, in its decision of 19 January 2010 in the Sidger case, that:?*°

This means that the General Terms of Tender is part of the calls for tender for
the individual broadcasting rights by virtue of the Act, its rules are mandatory
and can only be deviated from if the Act or the GTT expressly permit.

The GTT therefore contained obligations that were binding on the ORTT as well as on the
bidders. The Hungarian Court of Appeal so held in the Klubradio case on 12 July 2012, rejecting

the submission of the ORTT that the GTT only constituted administrative directions:***

The statement made by the Defendant in the Appeal according to which the Call
for Tenders and GTT represented procedures adopted only on the basis of a
statutory authorization and formed a set of execution rules which, contrary to
the provisions of the law containing the contracting option, could not create any
imperative, cannot be accepted. The Defendant did not state either that the
cited provisions of the Call for Tenders and GTT were in breach of the law and
violated the Broadcasting Act, yet the rules of GTT and the Call for Tenders must
be equally binding for the Caller of the Tender and the Bidders. Otherwise the
principle stressed in the Defendant’s Appeal with reference to the interest of the
national economy would be violated, according to which frequencies managed
by the State must be utilized in a fair and open competition.

The Klubradio case concerned a claimant who had been declared the winning bidder of a radio
frequency following a tender procedure, who sought, successfully, to compel ORTT to enter into
a broadcasting agreement. The claimant in that case had, therefore, already acquired the right to

a valuable asset and sought to compel ORTT to deliver that asset to it.

However, the present case is different, since here Slager was not declared the winning bidder.
Claimants contend rather that, had ORTT followed the proper procedures, it ought to have been
declared to be the winning bidder. Thus Claimants’ case requires the Tribunal to analyse the
nature of the rights held by Slager in the tender process prior to the declaration of the winning

bid. Can such rights constitute proprietary assets of Slager?

In view of the analysis as to applicable law already undertaken by the Tribunal above, it is
necessary first to determine the character of those rights under Hungarian law. Some indication
of the character of the rights is provided by the decisions of the Hungarian courts in the Sidger
proceedings. The claim that Slager advanced before the Metropolitan Court was that the ORTT
had breached the fairness of the competition and the provisions of the Media Act, the GTT and
the Call for Tenders. Accordingly Slager was entitled to a declaration of unlawfulness, and

357
af.

injunctive relie' The Metropolitan Court accepted that a bidder could vindicate its rights to a

proper tender before the civil courts.°***

Nevertheless, the fact that civil relief may be afforded to a bidder against the ORTT if the latter
does not observe the tender conditions does not suffice to determine whether the bidder’s
rights are proprietary in character. In answer to a question from the Tribunal, Claimants

confirmed that:*°

The review of the civil courts of the conduct of the ORTT in question was and is
limited in important respects. The Courts have held that they cannot second-
guess the ORTT's decision-making process, such as the scoring of individual
criteria, but they can and will review the formal compliance of the ORTT with the
bid criteria.

The overall purpose of the tender was, as the Supreme Court confirmed in its decision in the
Slager proceedings, ‘to enable a competition with equal chances between the media-providers,
also in respect of the frequency-tender.’*° Such a right is undoubtedly a very important one. It is
of the essence of fair decision-making in a state governed according to law that individuals
should be entitled to expect that a regulatory authority will comply with the legal framework

complaint that Claimants raise in the present proceedings and in particular of the rights they

allege under this head of their claim.

But the existence of such rights is not sufficient to answer the question whether this Tribunal
had jurisdiction to vindicate such rights on the international plane. For that purpose, it is
necessary to determine whether the rights constitute valuable proprietary assets of the
Claimants. In line with the analysis already undertaken in Part VI E above the Tribunal is in no

doubt that they do not.

In the first place, the rights accorded to Slager by virtue of its participation in the tender were
also accorded to every other bidder. That follows necessarily from the fundamental purpose of
the tender, confirmed by the Hungarian Constitutional Court, as enabling a competition with
equal chances. It is perfectly possible to construe such a right as held by all if is it a right to due
process, or, in the language of the Treaties, to ‘fair and equitable treatment’. Such rights are,
of their nature, designed to ensure that all persons affected by a governmental decision receive
the equal protection of the law. But a property right is something quite different. It constitutes a
right held by its owner to the exclusion of others. It is no answer to say that the rights acquired
by bidders in the 2009 Tender were acquired for valuable consideration. That may have created
a contractual relationship between each bidder and the ORTT. But each bidder did not thereby
acquire a valuable asset, capable of being alienated. If that were so, it would mean that each
bidder had, by virtue of its participation in the bid, acquired the same asset. But this makes no
sense in the context of a tender, the very purpose of which is to determine which of a number of

bidders is to acquire the asset in question, namely the 2009 Broadcasting Right.

In the second place, none of the rights alleged to arise directly from participation in the 2009
Tender could be said to be assets or property owned or controlled by Claimants. On the contrary,
Slager’s rights in the 2009 Tender were rights concerning participation in a process that would
determine whether it could acquire ownership of an asset. Such rights could not, in the words of
the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, be ‘freely sold and bought, and thus ha[ve] a monetary value’.*” In
the absence of this character, it is no answer to say that Slager’s rights arising from its
participation in the 2009 Tender had a contractual as well as a regulatory basis. As the Tribunal
in Waste Management II held: ‘[njon-compliance by a government with contractual obligations
is not the same thing as, or equivalent or tantamount to, an expropriation.“ The Tribunal has

already considered, and rejected for the reasons set out in Part VI E above, Claimants’ argument
that all rights under the Civil Code other than inherent rights are to be regarded as proprietary.
This accords neither with the structure and language of the Civil Code; nor with the expert
evidence as to the nature of property under Hungarian law; nor with the fundamental notions of

property embodied in the concept of expropriation at international law.

In the final analysis, the Tribunal is satisfied that the only proprietary right that Claimants had,
capable of protection from expropriation, was the Broadcasting Right it acquired in 1997. That
right was a right of limited duration. It expired on 18 November 2009. None of the ways in
Claimants have sought to plead their case on the injustices that they allege were perpetrated
upon them in the 2009 Tender meet the basic requirement of a property right. This being so, the
Contracting States to the instruments of consent, namely the Netherlands and Switzerland BITs,
have not conferred upon this Tribunal jurisdiction to determine Claimants’ claims on the merits.
Accordingly this Tribunal has no option but to dismiss Claimants’ claims of expropriation as

presently maintained in this arbitration for lack of jurisdiction.

G. Costs

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides that:

[...] the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses
incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how
and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the
Tribunal and the charges for the use of facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such
decision shall form part of the award.

In accordance with the directions of the Tribunal at the Hearing, both Parties submitted written
observations and schedules of costs on 31 January 2014. Respondent submits that, in the event
that it were to succeed at the jurisdictional stage, it ought to receive its costs, particularly in view
of what it characterises as its “rational and good faith responses to the highly aggressive and
inappropriate litigation tactics adopted by Claimants.”*™ Claimants, on the other hand, submit
that, in the event that the Tribunal finds it does not have jurisdiction over all or part of the claim,
it ought to order that each Party bear its own costs and contribute equally to the fees and
expenses of the Tribunal and the Centre. It submits that “[t]his is consistent with the prevailing

practice of investment treaty arbitration tribunals when a legitimate claim has been alleged but

dismissed, absent evidence of bad faith or misconduct on the part of the claimant or its

counsel.”*°°

It is clear from the travaux of the Convention that its framers intended to leave an arbitral

tribunal with broad discretion as to how to apportion costs.** Schreuer comments that:*”

In the absence of reasons to decide otherwise, each party should bear half of the
costs of the arbitration including the charges for the Centre’s services and the
fees and expenses of the arbitrators and should pay for its own expenses in
preparing and presenting its case.

In the present case, the Tribunal considers that this is the proper order for costs. It does not
accept Respondent’s submission that Claimants adopted highly aggressive and dilatory litigation
tactics. On the contrary, it finds that Claimants acted in good faith in bringing and prosecuting
their claim for alleged breaches of the Treaties. Respondent could have consented to submit the
wider dispute encompassing Claimants’ non-expropriation claims to ICSID arbitration, a
possibility specifically envisaged by Article 10 (2)(b) of the Switzerland BIT. Respondent however
decided not to give its consent, as it was entitled to do. Respondent also insisted at the First
Procedural Hearing that Claimants submit a full Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits before
Respondent was required to indicate whether it intended to challenge the jurisdiction of the
Centre and the Tribunal. This, too, was Respondent’s right under the ICSID Rules. But it had the
effect that Claimants were put to substantial cost in pleading to the merits, costs that are

effectively thrown away.

The Tribunal does not consider that Claimants’ subsequent prosecution of the action can be
considered either aggressive or inappropriate. The withdrawal of Claimants’ counsel from the
record, and the need to appoint new counsel is not a step that can be laid at the door of
Claimants. Both Parties approached their pleadings on Respondent’s successive applications — its
Rule 41(5) Objection, its application for bifurcation and its challenge to jurisdiction — in a manner

that greatly assisted the Tribunal in its task.

Finally, the present Award is in no sense a vindication of Respondent’s position on the merits. On
the contrary, the Tribunal’s decision makes no finding, prima facie or otherwise, on the merits.
Rather, the decision turns solely on the proper construction of the narrow basis for jurisdiction

afforded to it by the Contracting Parties under the Treaties. The fact that the Tribunal has not

been invested with jurisdiction to determine Claimants’ claims beyond the claim for

expropriation does not mean that those other claims are unfounded.

For all of the above reasons, the Tribunal has decided that the appropriate order for costs is that
each Party should bear in equal shares the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges of
the Centre for the proceedings and that each Party shall bear its own expenses incurred in

connection with the proceedings.

The costs incurred by the Tribunal, the Centre and the Parties are set out below.
