private investors and foreign States by offering “facilities for conciliation and arbitration of
investment disputes between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States.” Aff.

SGS’s request for arbitration was made in accordance with Article 9 of the BIT, the ICSID
Convention, the ICSID Rules of Procedure of the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration
Proceedings, and the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Paraguay consented to the submission of the

dispute to ICSID arbitration pursuant to Article 9 of the BIT. !

BIT by failing to guarantee the observance of the commitments it has entered into

with respect to Claimant’s investment;

195. Finds that it does not need to resolve Claimant’s claim that Respondent’s

failure to fulfill its alleged cxtra-contractual promises of payment constituted an

additional breach of Article 11 of the BIT because (i) those claims ultimately
derive from the same set of facts and commitments that gave rise to the Tribunal’s
conclusion that Respondent breached Article 11 of the BIT by failing to guarantee

the observance of the contractual commitments it has entered into with respect to

finding would not affect the quantum of damages;

D. The ICSID Convention Requires That The Award Be
Recognized And Entered As A Judgment Of This Court

16. | The Award is governed by the [CSID Convention, to which the United States is a
member State. Chapter IV, Section 6 of the ICSID Convention addresses the “Recognition and
Enforcement of the Award.” Articles 53(1) and 54(1), in particular, read as follows:

Article 53(1). The award shall be binding on the parties and shall
not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those
provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and
comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that
enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant
provisions of this Convention.

Article 54(1). Each Contracting State shall recognize an award
rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the
pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories
as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State. A
Contracting State with a federal constitution may enforce such an
award in or through its federal courts «nd may provide that such

courts shall treat the award as if it were a final judgment of the
courts of a constituent state

the recognition and enforcement of ICSD awards through 22 U.S.C. § 1650a. 22 U.S.C.

States” and that “[t]he pecuniary obligations imposed by such an award shall be enforced and
shall be given the same full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court of
general jurisdiction of one of the several States.” In addition, that provision expressly excludes
application of the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1 ef seg.) to the enforcement of ICSID
awards, and, as a result, ICSID awards are not subject to review under the Federal Arbitration
Act. Furthermore, under 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(b) “[t]he district courts of the United States ... shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over actions and proceedings under subsection (a) of this section,
regardless of the amount in controversy.”

18. The Award provides, inter alia, that Paraguay owes SGS the principal amount of
US $39,025,950.86, plus interest at the U.S. dollar 30-day LIBOR rate average plus one
percentage point beginning on July 1, 1999 until the date of payment. The amount of such
interest though April 30, 2013 totals US $19,500,237.87. See Aff. Ex. E. In addition, SGS was
awarded US $336,961.64, which represents one-half the total amount of the costs of arbitration.
Aff. Ex. A, Award {J 197-198.

19. ICSID’s Secretary-General dispatched certified copies of the Award pursuant to
Article 49 of the ICSID Convention, Paraguay is required to comply with the Award pursuant to
Article 53 of the ICSID Convention, and the United States is obligated to recognize and enforce

the Award pursuant to Article 54 of the !CSID Convention.
