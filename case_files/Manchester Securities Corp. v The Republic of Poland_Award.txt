L INTRODUCTION

1, The Claimant is Manchester Securities Corp., a private investment firm incorporated under the
laws of the State of New York, U.S.A. (the “Claimant” or “Manchester”).' The Claimant's
address is 40 West 57" Street, 4” Floor, 10019 New York, NY, U.S.A. The Claimant is
represented by Mr. Bartosz Kruzewski, Mr. Audley Sheppard, Mr. Marcin Ciemitiski,
Ms. Christina Schuetz, Ms. Adelina Prokop and Ms. Monika Diehl of Clifford Chance, Janicka,
Kruzewski, Namiotkiewicz i wspdlnicy Sp.k., ul. Lwowska 19, 00-660 Warsaw, Poland and
Clifford Chance, 10 Upper Bank Street, E14 5JJ London, United Kingdom.

2. The Respondent is the Republic of Poland (the “Respondent” or “Poland” and, together with
the Claimant, the “Parties”). For the purposes of these proceedings, the Respondent's address is
Minister of Justice of the Republic of Poland, Al. Ujazdowskie 11, 00-950 Warsaw, Poland. The
Respondent is represented by Mr. Krzysztof Zakrzewski, Ms. Julita Zimoch-Tuchotka and
Dr. Marek Swiatkowski of Domaiski Zakrzewski Palinka Sp.k., Rondo ONZ1, 00-124 Warsaw,
Poland, as well as by Ms. Kinga Szczepanska and Ms. Joanna Jackowska-Majeranowksa,
General Counsel to the Republic of Poland, ul. Hoza 76/78, 00-682 Warsaw, Poland.

3. A dispute has arisen between the Parties in respect of which the Claimant commenced this
arbitration pursuant to the 7reaty between the United States of America and the Republic of

Poland Concerning Business and Economic Relations dated 21 March 1990 (the “BIT”).

4. The dispute principally concerns the Claimant's inability to enforce mortgages over certain
properties in Poland, which secured its claims under bonds issued by a Polish real estate
developer. The Claimant seeks declarations that through the actions of, inter alia, the Polish
courts, Parliament and a bankruptcy trustee, which prevented the enforcement of its claims and
mortgages, Poland breached the BIT by failing to provide the Claimant with fair and equitable
treatment (“FET”), protection for its legitimate expectations, full protection and security and
effective means of enforcing rights; by denying the Claimant justice; by subjecting the Claimant
to arbitrary and discriminatory measures; and by expropriating the Claimant’s investment without
prompt, adequate and full compensation. The Claimant seeks compensation for the loss suffered
as a result of the alleged BIT violations, together with interest and costs.

5. The Respondent denies that the Tribunal has jurisdiction and further denies that certain of the
actions referred to by the Claimant are attributable to Poland. Even if the Tribunal does find that
it has jurisdiction, the Respondent submits that the Claimant’s claims are without merit. The

Respondent argues that the Claimant is a “disappointed litigant” seeking to persuade the present

' Certificate of Incorporation of Manchester Securities Corp., 22 September 1986 (C-1).

Tribunal to act as a court of appeal to the Polish courts. The Respondent thus requests the Tribunal
to dismiss the claims and order the Claimant to pay all costs of the arbitration.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Notice of Arbitration dated 9 March 2015, the Claimant commenced these proceedings
against Poland pursuant to Article 1X(3) of the BIT and Article 3 of the 1976 Arbitration Rules
of the United Nations Commission of International Trade Law (the “UNCITRAL Rules”).

 

By its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant notified the Respondent of its appointment of The Hon.
Charles N. Brower as arbitrator in these proceedings. Judge Brower’s addres:

On 8 April 2015, the Respondent submitted its Reply to the Notice of Arbitration and appointed

jurisdiction and liability, and a second phase on quantum. The Claimant opposed bifurcation.

rules for the arbitration and fixing Brussels as the place of arbitration.

On 25 May 2016, the Respondent informed the ‘Tribunal that the Parties had jointly agreed on

certain outstanding requests, as well as on a methodology for the Respondent to support the

Claimant’s application for access to bankruptcy files. In addition, the Respondent informed the

Tribunal that the Parties had agreed to submit separate submissions containing any arguments
arising from the bankruptcy files requested by the Claimant.

Following the Tribunal’s rulings set out in Procedural Order No. 3, and the Parties’ agreement

communicated to the Tribunal on 25 May 2016, the Respondent produced certain documents and

explained why it could not produce others by letters of 8 and 13 June 2016.

Proceedings dated 27 May 2016 was received from applican:s

injured both by the activities of [Manchester] and the activities of QED.” They requested
that the Parties consent to the application of the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-
based Investor-State Arbitration (Rules on Transparency) and thereby allow the applicants to file
a written submission in these proceedings. In the alternative, they requested permission to be
involved as amicus curiae under Article 17(1) of the 2013 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

On 24 June 2016, the Respondent submitted its comments on the third party application, in which
it objected to the application of the Rules on Transparency, but argued that “the Applicants should
be granted the right to participate in the arbitral proceedings on the basis of Article 15(1) of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976.”

On the same day, the Claimant also provided its comments on the third party application,
objecting both to the admission of the applicants as amici curiae and 1o the proposed application

of the Rules on Transparency.
On 13 July 2016, the Claimant submitted its Reply.

On 14 July 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, rejecting the third party

application. This decision was separately communicated to the applicants.

On 13 October 2016, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder.

On 13 January and 19 April 2017, the Claimant and the Respondent filed their respective
submissions pursuant to the Parties’ agreement of 25 May 2016.

On 5 July 2017, the Parties confirmed the witnesses and experts that they wished to examine at
the hearing.

On 19 July 2017, a pre-hearing organizational meeting was held between the Parties and the

Tribunal via teleconference.

PCA Case No. 2015-18

procedural rules for the hearing and adopting a hearing timetable.

record, concerning the issue of possible double recovery by the Claimant.

alia, that the Respondent's request had been made out of time and that the new evidence was not

relevant to the issues in dispute.

the Respondent's request.

By letter dated 27 September 2017, the Tribunal granted the Respondent’s request to admit new

E, THE COMMENCEMENT OF ANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS

79, On 5 May 2009, afier it became clear that QD would not be able to repay its creditors, the
GERD Regional Court accepted (EID application for a declaration of bankruptcy and
opened liquidati dings (the “ P ings”).

 

 

80. The Court highlighted that:

When declaring the debtor’s bankruptcy, the Court does not lose sight of the situation of those
creditors who do not hold security interest in rem over the debtor's assets, including its
contractors and those who were to become the buyers of the constructed premises. The
bankruptcy procecdings, as a general enforcement, give theoretical chance of at least a partial
satisfaction of their claims (the conduct of individual enforcement proceedings by the particular
creditors does not provide any real opportunity in this respect).®

81. The Claimant states that because it had, until then, been prevented from enforcing its claims

GREE 6 the First, Second and Third Injunctions, it was now forced to pursue these

 

agains
claims in the Bankruptcy Proceedings.”

82. On 5 June 2009, the Bankruptcy Trustee filed an application with the District Court in Cracow
to “consider the possibility of performing the preliminary agreements for the establishment of
separate ownership titles to apartment and for sale,” justifying the request on the ground that
many of the Apartments had been “handed over” to the Prospective (EE uyers.?

83. The Claimant asserts that. on 26 June 2009, members of the Polish Parliament (“MP” or “MPs”)
filed a written appeal with the Bankruptcy Coun, calling upon it to protect the Prospective

Buyers.

F. THE PROSECUTOR’S ORDER PROHIBITING THE SALE OF rH QED eroreery

85. The previous year, on 27 November 2008, the Prosecutor had initiated a criminal investigation
against (BB representatives in response to allegations made by some of the Prospective
Buyers, including some of the (EB laimants, that QD representatives had misled
them by saying that QP would develop the Apartments to fulfil the Preliminary
Agreements.

86. In the context of these proceedings, on 26 October 2009, the Prosecutor issued an order seizing
the (ED Property as evidence and prohibiting the Bankruptcy Trustee from selling it
during the Bankruptcy Proceedings (the “Prosecutor’s Order”).

87. The Bankruptcy Trustee and the Claimant appealed against the Prosecutor’s Order on 4 and
24 November 2009, respectively. The Prosecutor's Order remained in effect during the appeals,
until it was quashed by the Regional Court in {Bon 31 May 2010.”

88. The Claimant asserts that, prior to the start of the Bankruptcy Proceedings, certain Prospective
Buyers, including some of the (EB claimants, sought a court order that QB nter

“Preliminary Agreement Enforcement Proceedings”). To secure the claims pending the
outcome of the proceedings, at the end of 2008 and in the first half of 2009, the Regional

101. Inter alia, the Supreme Court made the following findings:

‘The merits of the situation in fact established by the Courts enabled — contrary to the view of
the Court of Appeal ~ a finding that the three challenged mortgages were created in breach of
the principles of social co-existence (Art, 58 §2 of the Civil Code).

Firstly, the Court of Appeal’s general assumption that the claimants should bear in full the
consequences of the “lack of systemic security interests for the customers of property
developers”. When the developer was declared bankrupt (in 2009) and when the judgment under
appeal was delivered (February 2011), the solutions now provided for in the [Apartment Buyer
Protection Act] were indeed non-existent in Polish law, especially those concerning the content
of the property development agreement itself (Art. 22 et seq.) and the legal cffects of a
developer's being declared bankrupt after the conclusion of a preliminary agreement (Art. 4 and
Art. 36 of the Act). In that Act. legal solutions were accepted that are to protect the counterparties
of property developers against the risk of an investment’s failing and, in particular, the risk of
the developer's going bankrupt. The justification to the draft of the Act (draft of 22 April 2011)
shows that “Poland is one of the countries in the EU in which the risk of a property development
project is borne by the buyer”. It is possible that this state of affairs is primarily the result of a
specific contractual practice (standard contractual clauses) and the investment policy of property
developers. This does not mean, however, that in special cases the Polish courts should not —
under the law in force at the time a judgment is given (Art. 58 §2 and Art. 3531 of the Civil
Code) — strive 10 ensure an appropriate level of Jegal protection for the buyers of separate
residential premises (primarily if a dishonest developer goes bankrupt, with considerable sums
of investment capital involved), especially as the need for such protection also arises from
relevant constitutional standards (Art. 64 sec. 3 and Art. 76 of the Constitution). It should also
be stressed that in judgments of the Supreme Court there has been a correct tendency, which has
gained the approval of legal writers, to take into account at least the fundamental aim of the
protective legal solutions accepted by the legislative authorities in an assessment of certain
events (acts in law and their effects) that occurred before such solutions came into force [...].

If one takes into account the clearly protective purpose of the provisions of the Act of
16 September 2011, it should be held that the problem does not therefore consist, as the Court
of Appeal deduces, only in “granting privilege to thc claimants in the current proceedings”
because they are consumers, but in adopting legal protection for them that is justified by the
clearly dishonest conduct of the developer or even the ill-considered (risky) conduct by the
developer of its own economic activity, which threatened not only the implementation of the
investment but also the possibility of returning the buyers’ money. This meant, therefore, that it
‘was necessary to carry out an appropriately thorough examination of the circumstances in which
the developer established the mortgages being challenged, from the point of view of the
principles of social co-existence, while also taking into consideration the rules of professional
ethics of property developers. In the justification to the judgment of the Supreme Court of
21 June 2031, 1 CSK 559/10 (OSNC 2012, vol. 2, item 25, p. 87), it was accepted that the rules
of ethics of professional entities (banks) may be taken into account when classifying a bank’s
conduct as a tort, even though those rules are not directly cited in the standpoints given in the
cassation appeal.

 

Secondly, it is impossible to share the standpoint of the Court of second instance, which rejects
the argument that the creation of the challenged mortgages was in violation of the principles of
social co-existence, while arguing that the defendant US entity “took action to protect its claims”
against the developer and therefore demonstrated neutral — from the point of view of the
principles of social co-existence — “diligence in protecting its own rights” as a creditor of the
bankrupt entity. Such an opinion does not take into account the circumstances leading to
precisely such special protection that clearly worsens the situation of the developer’s original
creditors (initially with regard to the price of the premises by a demand that additional payments
be made for the premises and then with regard to priority of satisfaction), with both defendants
being fully aware of this state of affairs, after contractually “blocking” the possibility of the
original creditors’ (claimants’ ), who were interested in the most effective end to the construction
investment, taking action to secure their claims. The preliminary agreements contained,
accordingly, so-called negative clauses ruling out disclosure of the claimants’ rights to transfer
ownership title to separate premises in a land and mortgage register. Those clauses undoubtedly

18

PCA Case No. 2015-18
Award

served to ensure that the developer maintained an appropriate level of “creditworthiness” in
legal transactions, that creditworthiness enabling it to expand its business without restriction, It
is clear that defendant [Manchester] was aware of those clauses during the contractual
cooperation between the two defendants that was aimed at creating a basic form of financing for
the developer. Therefore, it should be noted that the action taken by defendant [Manchester] to
secure its interests as a new creditor of the developer was one of the planned results of the
dishonest conduct of the developer, with that defendant being aware of that dishonesty.

Thirdly, when examining whether the challenged mortgages were created in breach of the
principles of social istence, the ab: f a direct legal i ip between the clai
and defendant [Manchester], an entity contractually working with the developer, is irrelevant.
This docs not mean, however, that to apply Art. 58 §2 of the Civil Code one should not take into
account appropriate events (acts in law) between those entities and their conduct in connection
with the creation of the mortgages even though the claimants did not challenge the effectiveness
of those acts in law that created, inter alia, a considerable receivable for defendant [Manchester]
from the developer. From the point of view of those cooperating entities. it was indeed, as the
Court noted, a “typical business transaction” initiated 1 REE However, defendant
[Manchester] knew the content of the preliminary agreements for the transfer of ownership title
to the premises and the developer’s investment covenants, The findings of fact show that
defendant [Manchester] analyzed the said agreements during the audit conducted at Fl
appropriate terms were even added to the bond issue cooperation agreement of
2 November 2006, based on which, inter alia, the amounts payable under the bonds (of all
issues) acquired could become immediately due and payable on condition the preliminary
agreement of a specific group of the developer's customers (claimants) was rescinded. Therefore
there is no doubt that creating a mortgage over the real property to which the investment related,
with priority before the initial creditors (claimants) was an element of an appropriate legal and
economic calculation by defendant [Manchester].

  

Fourthly, also as the law currently stands it would be inappropriate to burden the claimants with
the full risk of the failure of the real estate investment undertaken on the property —
Street with the motivation adopted by the Court of Appeal, because it is one thing for the
developer's counterparties to accept the risk of an investment’s failing if the developer complies
with the terms of the preliminary agreements and conducts normal business activity in such a
way and on such a scale that is testament to its concern for its counterparties’ interests and the
success of the investment project (model of a developer’s rational service and commercial
activity), and something else entirely when there is the matter of the spreading the development
investment risk in a situation where the developer is conducting business on a wide scale, taking
on even more risk, inter alia by issuing bonds with a high interest rate per annum (25%), with a
high level of security for the claims under those bonds over its own assets (amounts payable
under the bonds becoming immediately due and payable, irrevocable power of attorney for that
creditor to transfer title to the developer's real property). The original counterparties of the
developer, which has significant capital provided by the claimants in order to achieve the
investment aim provided for in the agreement, cannot be burdened in full with the risk of such
extensive (and by nature somewhat carelessly conducted) business. The claimants had already
bome the risk of the failure of the investment (currently they are trying only to protect their
pecuniary claims, Art. 91 sec. 2 of the Bankruptcy Law). The developer's irresponsible and
irrational economic activity that led to the creation of mortgages for the benefit of a single, major
creditor contrary to the terms of the preliminary agreements and as a consequence permission
for defendant [Manchester] to “take the initiative” with regard to finalizing the investment
project (in the form of a proposal to increase the price of flats for the claimants) may therefore
be seen as dishonest conduct that is inconsistent with the principles of social co-existence and
professional ethics of property developers (Ari. 58 § 2 of the Civil Code).

The Claimant's Position

112. The Claimant contends that the Prospective Buyers were affluent individuals typically buying
residential premises for investment purposes. '”* According to the Claimant, this fact is confirmed
by QB usiness plan, which described its target client as “already hav[ing] an apartment,

and frequently a house, and want[ing] to invest further.”!”

The Respondent's Position

114. The Respondent contends that the Prospective Buyers were consumers and, as with any big
group, were diversified in terms of wealth and status. Most of them were purchasing the premises
to meet their own and their families’ housing needs and were either “using their savings or taking
out loans in order to pay the purchase price.”''° The Respondent also asserts that, for some, the

they could not afford to participate in the ED Case.”

Agreement

The Claimant's Position

collateralized.''* It cites in support the (ED supreme Court Ruling,'!” which states that
“there were no grounds for finding an oversecured status.”'*° The Claimant also states that it is
incorrect for the Respondent to add up the face value of all of the mortgages securing each Bond
issue and to suggest that the total value of the mortgages was higher than the actual claim secured
by those mortgages. The Claimant explains that the mortgages jointly secured Manchester’s
claims, such that Manchester could not receive more than the actual amount of its claim from all
of the mortgages jointly or from each of them individually. 2! Further, the value of the mortgages
“cannot be compared to the face value of each Bond issue, as the mortgages also secured interest

and enforcement costs,”'?

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

JURISDICTION

Dispute resolution by arbitration is provided for in Article IX of the BIT, which states, in relevant

part:

ARTICLE IX
Settlement of Disputes Between a Party and an Investor of the Other Party

For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is defined as a dispute involving [...] (c)
an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an
investment. A decision of a Party which denies entry if an investment shall not constitute
an investment dispute within the meaning of this Article.

In the event of an investment dispute between a Party and a national or company of the
other Party, the parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by
consultation and negotiation, which may include the use of non-binding, third party
procedures, Each Party shall encourage its nationals and companies to resort to local courts,
especially for the resolution of disputes relating to administrative actions. [...]

(a) At any time after six months from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or
company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for
settlement by conciliation or binding arbitration to the International Centre for the
Settlement of Investment Disputes (“Centre”) or to the Additional Facility of the Centre or
pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade

133. Article I(1) of the BIT sets out the following definitions:
[..]

(b) “investment” means every kind of investment, in the territory of one Party owned or
controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other party, and includes:

 

(i) tangible and intangible property, including rights, such as mortgages, liens and pledges;

(ii) a company or shares of stock, or other interests in a company or interests in the assets
the 4

(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated
with an investment;

(iv) intellectual property which includes, rights relating to: literary and artistic works,
including sound recordings, patent rights, industrial designs, semiconductor mask
works, trade secrets, and trademarks, service marks, and trade names; and

(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law:

LJ

(e) “associated activities” are activities associated with an investment, such as the organization,
control, operation, maintenance and disposition of companies, branches, agencies, offices,
factories or other facilities for the conduct business; the making, performance and
enforcement of contracts; the acquisition, use, protection and disposition of property of all
kinds including intellectual property rights; the borrowing of funds; the purchase and
issuance of equity shares and other securities; and the purchase of foreign exchange;

Led
(i) “commercial activity” means activities carried on by nationals or companies of a Party
related to the sale or purchase of goods and services and the granting of franchises or
rights under license, which are not investments or related activities;

LJ
134. The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s claims fall outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal
because: (1) the Claimant has no investment protected under the BIT; (2) the Claimant has acted
in bad faith; and (3) the Tribunal is not competent to review the decisions of domestic courts in

this case. The Parties’ arguments in respect of these objections are set out below.
k Whether the Claimant had protected investments under the BIT

The Respondent's Position

135. The Respondent submits that the Claimant had no protected investment under the BIT.

136. First, noting that the BIT contains different definitions for the terms “investment”, “associated
activities” and “commercial activity”, the Respondent argues that, within the meaning of the BIT,
the Claimant did not make an investment in Poland, but only conducted commercial activity.'
Accordingly, the Claimant is not entitled to access the BIT dispute settlement mechanism, which

is available for investment only.'**

PCA Case No. 2015-18

Award

137. Second, the Respondent submits that, because the BIT does not contain “a precise definition” of
the term investment (the BIT states that “investment” means “every kind of investment”), it is
necessary to take into account the meaning of investment in international law.'** In this regard,

the Respondent argues that the criteria set out in the ICSID case Salini v, Morocco are applicable.
According to the Respondent, these criteria are: (i) a contribution; (ii) a certain duration;

 

iii) an
element of risk; and (iv) contribution to the economic development of the host State.'** The
Respondent submits that the so-called Sa/ini test is relevant even outside the ICSID system and
argues that it reflects customary law.'’’ It also notes that other tribunals have added further
criteria: for example, the tribunal in Phoenix Action v. The Czech Republic required that the

investment be made in good faith and in accordance with the law of the host State.'**

138, The Respondent submits that, in the present case, the rights that the Claimant identifies as its
investments (that is, claims for money to be paid in connection with the Bond Purchase
Agreement and rights under the = and = Mortgages) do not meet the
“contribution”, “risk” and “duration” criteria.'*° The Respondent also submits that the alleged
investments were made in bad faith (see paragraphs 157-165 below) and did not contribute to the

economic development of Poland.'*”

139. Relying on Romak v. Uzbekistan and Postova banka v. Greece, the Respondent argues that the
“contribution” criterion requires “the creation of value” to the host State economy.'®’ In the
present case, the Respondent submits that the Claimant’s purchase of Bonds was a mere
“financial transaction” that did not encompass a contribution element, According to the
Respondent, while the Claimant paid PLN QD or the Bonds, none of the cases cited by
the Claimant support its assertion that monetary transfers on a standalone basis can meet the

“contribution” criterion. '

The Respondent also denies that the Claimant’s alleged investment meets the “risk” criterion.
Again relying on Romak and Postovd banka, the Respondent submits that for purposes of
identifying an investment it is necessary to distinguish between general commercial risk and
investment risk. Thus, “an investment risk would be an operational risk,” whereas a commercial
risk would only cover, infer alia, “the risk that one of the parties might default on its
obligations,”'® which exists in any economic relationship and is not useful for identifying an
investment. In the present case, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's purchase of Bonds did
not entail any element of operational risk as the Claimant merely “assumed the ordinary

commercial risk of the counterparty failing to perform its contractual obligation.”'

With regard to the “duration” criterion, the Respondent dismisses the Claimant's characterization
of the financing project as “long-term”, noting that the Claimant could terminate the Bond
Purchase Agreement and accelerate the Bond repayments at any time if GED cefautted on
payments (which it is precisely what Manchester eventually did).'®*

Third, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's rights do not fall within any of the categories
expressly listed in Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT. The Respondent notes that Article I(1)(b)(iii) of the
BIT provides that the term “investment” includes a “claim to money or a claim to performance
having ic value, and i with an 76 The R ly
argues that a “claim to money” can only be qualified as an investment within the meaning of the
BIT if there is a prior investment with which that claim is associated. In other words, it is
necessary for the Tribunal not only to analyze the wording of the BIT,'*”’ but also the relationship

between the Parties in toto."

In this regard, the Respondent notes that the Claimant was not 2 hareholder and had no
other interest in the company. The financing by the Claimant of EE activities therefore
does not qualify as an investment under the BIT.'® The Respondent also denies that the “debt
interest” alleged by the Claimant is an investment under Article 1(1) of the BIT as it is a “claim

to money” rather than “interest in a company,”"'”°

As to the rights under the QED 2»< QED Mortgages, the Respondent states that the
fact that “mortgages” are listed in Article I(1)(i) as an example of an investment, does not mean
that any mortgage is an investment. An analysis has to be carried out to determine whether it is
connected with an investment.'”! In the present case, the Mortgages were established in

connection with the Claimant’s commercial activity and thus do not qualify as an investment.'”

The Claimant's Position

145.

146.

147

The Claimant submits that its investment in Poland consists of:

a) Inrelation to the Bond Purchase Agreement concluded with (>

(i) The payment of PLN n exchange for the Bonds issued at such
face value, as financing for real estate projects in Poland; and

(ii) Claims, arising under the terms of the Bond Purchase Agreement, for the payment of
money on presentation of coupons and at maturity of the Bonds, which were
crystallised in the Payment Order and acknowledged in the Bankruptcy Proceedings;
and

 
 

b) Manchester's rights arising out of the QIN on (ED Mortgages, which were
acquired to secure the receivables under the Bond Purchase Agreement.'”?
The Claimant further submits that its investment falls within “several of the enumerated
categories of investment set out in Article I(1)(b),” as follows:
a) The Bonds, in conjunction with the terms of the Bond Purchase Agreement, evidence a debt

interest in| pursuant to Article I(1)(b)(ii) of the BIT, which would not have arisen
but for the purchase of the Bonds;

b)

The Bonds and their coupons constitute “a claim to money” pursuant to Article I(1)(b)(iii)
of the BIT. They also constitute a “right (to payment) conferred by contract” pursuant to
Article I(1)(b)(v) of the BIT.

©) The QED :10 GED Mortgages, which were acquired to secure the receivables
under the Bond Purchase Agreement, are “mortgages” pursuant to Article I(1)(b)(i) of the
BIT. The rights arising out of them are a “right conferred by law or contract” pursuant to
Article 1(1)(b)(v) of the BIT.'7*
In the alternative, the Claimant submits that its investment also falls within the ordinary meaning
of the term “investment”, as used in the phrase preceding the enumeration of specific categories
in Article I(1)(b) of the BIT. In this regard, the Claimant argues that the ordinary meaning of the
verb “to invest” is “to employ (money) in the purchase of anything from which interest or profit

is expected.”'”* Pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, the Claimant purchased the Bonds

from QD a price of nm: with the expectation of a return on the Bonds over

time. Accordingly, the purchase of the Bonds was an “investment”. '7°

The Claimant submits that its interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the term “investment” is
consistent with the object and purpose of the BIT, which is to stimulate the flow of private capital.
The Claimant adds that the Bond Purchase Agreement “provided a flow of private capital into
Poland enabling (EEE eal estate development in the territory of Poland."'””

The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s use of the Sa/ini test, arguing that it is contrary to
Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “VCLT”), which requires that
“a treaty should be interpreted in good faith (i) in accordance with its ordinary meaning, (ii) in

its context and in the light of the treaty’s object and purpose.” '*

The Claimant states that the Respondent is thus importing case law that is not connected with the
BIT, but rather with a specific provision in the ICSID Convention. The Claimant considers this
methodology to be “misplaced in the context of this arbitration,” given that the ICSID Convention
is not applicable to UNCITRAL arbitrations and that Poland is not a party to the ICSID
Convention. Furthermore, the Claimant notes that the practice of turning to ICSID case law in

zbekistan, is “fact-specific” and “exceptional”.!”*

 

non-ICSID cases, as occurred in Romak v.

Altematively, the Claimant states that, even if the Tribunal were to apply the criteria set out in

Salini, these criteria would be fulfilled in the present case.

With regard to the “contribution” criterion, the Claimant argues that it should be interpreted “in
broad terms” and that investment tribunals have “regularly found that monetary transfers
constitute a contribution.”"° Thus, according to the Claimant, the monetary transfer of
ri for the purchase of Bonds sufficed to satisfy this requirement. The Claimant
denies the Respondent's assertion that the Bond purchase was a “purely commercial” transaction,
noting that the Bond Purchase Agreement provided for long-term cooperation and would allow

se . issue bonds up to PLN QED f° the purposes of developing housing and

commercial properties. '*! Through the Bond Purchase Agreement, the Claimant obtained “a debt

153. The Claimant also submits that the “duration” criterion is fulfilled, as the financial relationship
between the Claimant and QD was “long-term.” Noting that “there is consensus in the case
law that a two-year period is a sufficient duration for purposes of the Salini test,” the Claimant
points out that “each tranche of the Bonds was to be redeemed within two years from the date of

issuance.”'S*

154. In relation to the “risk” criterion, the Claimant submits that the “presence of the credit, political
and market risks has been ized as indicative of an i (and by implication, of
investment risk) in other cases.”'** The Claimant's venture to provide long-term financing for
ae ee: estate projects implied several risks: (i) the credit risk that QD woutd be
unable to pay part or all of its interest obligations and that part or none of the capital invested
would be returned; (ii) the political risk that the Claimants rights as a bondholder would not be
recognized by the Polish authorities; (iii) the market risk that the value of GED roperties
might drop; and (iv) interest rate and inflationary risk, namely the risk that the fixed interest rate
associated with the Bonds would not compensate for the erosion of the value of the invested

capital due to inflation.'**

155. The Claimant argues that a “contribution to the economic development” of the host State may
not be required even under the Salini test, but states that this criterion is in any event met in the
present case, as the financing provided by Manchester enabled QEEED 10 engage in real estate
development in southern Poland, creating jobs and housing infrastructure. '**

156. Finally, the Claimant objects to the Respondent's description of the Claimant's activity in Poland

as the provision of “financial services” and “a purely commercial activity.”'*’ The Claimant
argues that, to be a “commercial activity” under Article I(1)(i) of the BIT, an activity must be
“related to the sale ... of ... services,” which is not the case here. Thus, the Claimant submits that
its investment “was not purely a sale of financial services, but a long-term financial investment

definition of “commercial activity” carves out activities which are themselves investments.
Accordingly, since its investment, including the purchase of the Bonds, falls within the definition

of “investment” in the BIT, it cannot constitute a “commercial activity”.'?

2. Whether the Claimant acted in bad faith

The Respondent's Position

157. The Respondent submits that the Claimant is not protected under the BIT because it acted in bad
faith when establishing and enforcing the: GED Morigages.

158. Referring to various arbitral awards, the Respondent argues that it is “well established in
investment law that in cases where an investor has breached fundamental host state laws or acted
in bad faith or in a corrupt manner, protection under an investment treaty should be denied to that
investor.”'® According to the Respondent, the standard of ‘good faith “should be interpreted with
reference to the universal standards that have been developed in both domestic and international
law,” which require that a party deal “fairly and honestly” and “tefrain[] from taking unfair

191

advantage.
159. The Respondent submits that the Claimant's bad faith is evidenced by the following facts:

Claimant agreed that would establish the Mortgages in favour of Claimant despite being
fully aware that (i) the ae Buvers had paid the full or a substantial portion of the

 

 

purchase price for the nd Apartments, (i had agreed to transfer
to the ive Buyers the ip rights to these without any

and (iii) enforcement of the Mortgages would deprive the Prospective Buyers of any rights to
the a and Apartments. Moreover, Claimant was aware that
discouraged the Prospective Buyers from registering their rights to acquire tht and
Gas Apartments in the LMR. This means that in the process to establish the Mortgages

Claimant acted unethically and in bad faith and was fully aware and accepted that the
establishment and enforcement of the Morigages would harm the Prospective Buyers.'”

With respect to the latter point, the Respondent notes that Mr. QQEEMBestified at the hearing
that Manchester reviewed the Preliminary Agreements during its due diligence exercise, and that

it would not have agreed to invest the full PLN ED i: GD ac the Prospective

Buyers’ claims ranked ahead of its own in the LMR.

The Respondent also asserts that in this case the Claimant used a modus operandi similar to that
of its parent company, QD. which frequently invests “in sovereign bonds of distressed states
or corporations, without considering that [its] exorbitant profits are made at the expense of

ordinary people.”!** The Respondent describes several such investments aD”

The Respondent dismisses the Claimant's argument that the Prospective Buyers themselves
failed to secure their rights, emphasizing that, under the Non-Registration Clauses in the
Preliminary Agreements, they were prevented from entering their rights in the LMR. The
Respondent asserts, additionally, that the Preliminary Agreements were standard form contracts,
with the terms being presented to the Prospective Buyers on a “take-it-or-leave it” basis. As such,
the Respondent views the Prospective Buyers as having been forced to agree that their right to

purchase the apartments would not be registered in the LMR.'"°

The Respondent also asserts that the Prospective Buyers were not informed of the establishment
of the Claimant's Mortgages,"®” In the Respondent’s view, QED and Manchester took

advantage of the fact that the Prospective Buyers were mostly consumers who “did not

 

d the legal ities and of the Non-Registration Clauses or mortgage
law.”!%* The Respondent asserts that MEBind the Claimant “jointly decided to shift the risks
to the Prospective Buyers by encumbering their GD 2. Apartments with
mortgages, thus bringing about a situation where the Prospective Buyers involuntarily

underwrote a highly risky venture.”!?

In respect of the Claimant's reliance on the Restructuring Agreement as a sign of its good faith,
the Respondent states that it was a “fagade” with an “unrealistic” payment schedule offering “no.
real chance for EEE o pay off its debt,” given that the first payment of PLN QED was

due only two months after the agreement was entered into.”

165. The Claimant's conduct, the Respondent concludes, was unethical and contrary to the principle
of good faith. Accordingly, the Tribunal should decide that the dispute is not within its
jurisdiction.”"' Alternatively, if the Tribunal considers that the issue of good faith should be
examined in connection with the merits, the Respondent requests the Tribunal “to deny Claimant

any substantive protection” under the BIT.

The Claimant's Position

166, The Claimant maintains that its investment was made in good faith: it “secured its rights, while
the Prospective Buyers chose not to do so.”?"* In the Claimant’s view, “[i]t would be an absurd
outcome for the Tribunal to conclude that securing one’s rights demonstrates bad faith.”?"

167. The Claimant further argues that the Respondent’s allegations of bad faith are “contrary to the
factual record.””* Specifically, the Claimant submits that:

(i) the Prospective Buyers made the majority of payments after .. - Manchester’ 's Mortgages were
and

 

s did not make it i for to transfer the
ownership title to the Apartments to Prospective Buyers encumbrance-free in due course; (ii)
the Non-Registration Clauses were freely agreed between| jand the Prospective Buyers;

and (iii) the Prospective Buyers did not have any property nghts m the Apartments. °°

168. In respect of the latter point, the Claimant submits that “the Preliminary Agreements did not
create a right of ownership of the Apartments or any other property interest in the Apartments.”?”
It asserts that the Preliminary Agreements constituted only a contractual undertaking by QD
to eventually enter into property sale agreements with the Prospective Buyers on the agreed

terms,”

169. The Claimant contends that, under Polish law, if a developer goes bankrupt before the conclusion
of the property sale agreements, prospective buyers only have monetary claims in bankruptcy
proceedings, regardless of whether or not their preliminary agreements have been notarized. The

prospective buyers are then able to satisfy their claims on a pro rata basis out of the general

bankruptcy estate with the same priority as other unsecured creditors.” In the present case,
therefore, the Prospective Buyers did not have a legitimate claim to the Apartments, but only to

“contractual claims for the transfer of title to the Apartments in future.”"°

170. The Claimant adds, in response to the Respondent's contention that Prospective Buyers were not

17

informed about the establishment of the Claimant’s Mortgages, that the “owner of the real
property ha[d] no obligation to inform that they were going to establish a mortgage.”?'' The
Claimant points to the Restructuring Agreement as proof of its willingness to act in good faith,?!*

. The Claimant also observes that “the Respondent’s allegation of bad faith focuses solely on the
establishment and enforcement of the Mortgages,” while “the other components of Manchester's
Investment (Manchester's payment of PLN QD uncer the Bond Purchase Agreement

and its claims to payment of money) arc not even tainted by allegations of bad faith.”?!*

172. The Claimant further remarks that the “conduct that the Respondent alleges constituted

Manchester’s bad faith substantially differs from the conduct that investment arbitration tribunals

have found to constitute bad faith ...”?!*

173. In any event, the Claimant asserts that making an investment in good faith is not a jurisdictional

requirement under the BIT.'5 The Claimant “does not deny the gravity of the principle of good
faith in public international law,” but submits that “the principle cannot be read into the wording

174. Finally, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent's comments on the strategy of GD are
irrelevant to this case.””° In any event, the Claimant objects to the Respondent's characterization
of EEE ovestment strategy, stating that “investment in distressed debt is by no mean
‘modus operandi’ ,” as ‘BD employs a trading program that encompasses a wide range of

a. Whether the Tribunal can review decisions of domestic courts

The Respondent's Position

175. According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s claim is “outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal
because the Claimant is requesting a substential review of the Polish court decisions and a

determination of whether these decisions were issued in accordance with Polish law.”?”

176. The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s request is not in accordance with international law
and hence is not covered by the Respondent’s consent to arbitration under Article IX of the
BIT.” The Respondent adds that, “if the Tribunal decides that a review of local court decisions
falls within its jurisdiction, the Respondent submits that, absent a denial of justice, this review is
not encompassed by any BIT standard, particularly the fair and equitable treatment standard.””24
And in this case, the Claimant has failed to prove a denial of justice (as seen in paragraphs 288-

293 below).

177. In support of its view that only a denial of justice can justify a review of domestic judicial
decisions, the Respondent asserts that the parties to the BIT, Poland and the U.S.A., clearly
intended this to be the case.” In the Respondent's view, the U.S.A. confirmed this intention in

its submission in £/i Lilly v. Canada.”

178. Further, the submits that tribunals have that decisions of

 

domestic courts can breach international law only if a denial of justice has occurred. It relies on
Arif v, Moldova, where the tribunal stated that arbitral tribunals cannot “put themselves in the

shoes of international appellate courts.”??"

179. Additionally, the Respondent contends that international law provides for “a very high threshold”
in order for an act to be regarded as a denial of justice, as stated in Mondev v. United States of
America.”* The Respondent argues that, contrary to the Claimant’s assertions, the tribunals in

Saipem v. Bangladesh and Arif v. Moldova applied the test for denial of justice.?”°

180. The Respondent admits that in one case, Tatneft v. Ukraine, the tribunal held that judicial conduct
which is arbitrary and unreasonable can breach the FET standard even if it does not amount to a
denial of justice, but emphasizes that the tribunal in that case stated that it was “not an appellate
court” and concluded that “the mere misapplication of domestic law is not enough to give rise to

liability absent some kind of adverse intention.”?*"

The Claimant's Position

181. The Claimant first denies that it is requesting that the Tribunal act as an appellate court or find
that the decisions of the Polish courts breached Polish law. Instead, the Claimant states that it:
claims that acts of [the] Polish judiciary breached Poland’s international obligations under the
BIT and customary international law, and in particular that they were arbitrary, discriminatory,
resulted in expropriation of Manchester’s Investments and amounted to the denial of justice.?*'
182. Second, the Claimant submits that it is a settled rule of customary international law that the State
is responsible for the acts of all its organs, including the judiciary, and that acts of the judiciary

may violate intemational law and an investment treaty.2>?

‘Third, the Claimant submits that, in accordance with the BIT and investment treaty case law, “the
Tribunal may review the decisions of the Polish courts under treaty standards of protection other

than denial of justice.”?°

According to the Claimant, Article 11(6) of the BIT refers both to “the standards of treatment
required by customary international law,” including the prohibition of denial of justice, and to
“specific obligations” such as the FET standard and full protection and security.”* Accordingly,
in the Claimant’s view, the BIT “does not limit its protections to those required under customary
international law (such as the prohibition of denial of justice).”*° The Claimant argues that the
phrase “in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law” in
Article I1(6) of the BIT is intended “to set a floor. not a ceiling, in order to avoid a possible
interpretation of [the FET and full protection and security standards] below what is required by

international law.”7*°

The Claimant also notes that Article II(7) of the BIT further requires the Contracting Parties to
provide effective means of legal recourse for asserting claims and enforcing rights under the BIT
and that the BIT does not limit the liability of a State for the acts of its judicial organs. ‘The
Claimant concludes that the BIT protection is broader than that traditionally required under

international law (such as the prohibition against denial of justice).”"”

The Claimant rejects the Respondent's reliance on the U.S.A.’s submission in Eli Lilly v. Canada,
arguing that a C Party’s ion in another arbitration does not a binding

interpretation of the BIT.**

In addition to its analysis of the BIT, the Claimant cites investment case law: (i) Arif v. Moldova,
where the tribunal ruled that the decisions of the Moldovan courts invalidating a lease agreement
violated the FET standard, without amounting to a denial of justice;?” (ii) ATA Construction v.
Jordan, where the tribunal ruled that a judgment of the Jordanian Court of Cassation violated the
bilateral investment treaty at hand without finding a denial of justice. due to the Court’s
application of a new law retrospectively; (iii) Deutsche Bank v. Sri Lanka, where the tribunal

where the tribunal found that a series of decisions issued by the Ukrainian courts invalidating the
investor’s shareholding in a local company violated the FET standard, but did not meet the higher

threshold for a denial of justice."

188. The Claimant further submits that the decisions of local courts can amount to expropriation, citing
to Sistem Mithendislik v. Kyrgyz Republic and Saipem v. Bangladesh.’ The Claimant also argues
that the decisions of local courts can breach the effective means, and full protection and security
standards. It relies on White Industries v. India, as well as Chevron v. Ecuador, where the tribunal
ruled that “the effective means standard is separate from the denial of justice standard” and that
“[a]lthough both standards overlap and are directed at the same potential wrongs, the threshold

for finding a breach of the effective means standard is lower than for a denial of justice ...”*

officials in Article 115 of the Polish Criminal Code.”*” Additionally, the Claimant submits that

the Bankruptcy Trustee acted under the control of the Polish State, as required for attribution

under Article 8 of the ILC Articles, given that he: (i) was appointed by a Judge-Commissioner (a

member of the Bankruptcy Court); (ii) reports to the Judge~Commissioner; and (iii) is supervised
by the Judge-Commissioner, who may dismiss him if he does not perform his obligations.“

19]. Additionally, the Claimant submits that the acts of the Bankruptcy Court (such as the approval
of the transfer of the Apartments to the Prospective Buyers) are attributable to the Respondent
because the Bankruptcy Court is an organ of the State. In the Claimant’s view, whether or not a

specific act is taken within the exercise of the Court's judicial function is therefore irrelevant.?*°

The Respondent's Position

192, The Respondent submits that the acts of the Bankruptcy Trustee are not attributable to the
R 250 First, the Ri argues that the ‘Trustee is not an organ of the
Respondent under Polish law, as required for attribution under Article 4 of the ILC Articles.?5!
According to the Respondent, a bankruptcy official takes steps on his or her own behalf or for
the bankrupt entity, and is liable for any damage as a consequence of undue performance of his
or her duties, as was held by the EB court of Appeal.” The Polish Criminal Code, upon
which the Claimant relies to classify the Bankruptcy Trustee as a public official, cannot be used
as a valid reference, as its definitions depart from the general understanding of terms and are
usually much wider.’ The Bankruptcy Trustee should also not be considered a de facto organ
of the Respondent as the Trustee is autonomous and the Judge-Commissioner exercises only

“general supervision” over the Trustee’s activities.?**

193. Further, the Respondent asserts that attribution under Article 8 of the ILC Articles “requires the
instructions, direction or control to relate to the conduct which is said to have breached the

international obligation.”*** In the present case, the conduct of the Bankruptcy Trustee cannot be

attributed to the Respondent under Article 8, as the Claimant has “failed to establish that
Respondent gave any specific instruction to or specifically controlled the Bankruptcy Trustee in

connection with the transfer of the Apartments to the Prospective Buyers.”?°°

The Respondent also submits that the Judge-Commissioner’s approval of the transfer of the
Apartments to the Prospective Buyers was not a judicial decision. In the Respondent's view, the
Judge-Commissioner was acting in lieu of a creditors’ committee (which was not set up in
BD Bankruptcy Proceedings).*’ The Respondent avers that had the Judge-Commissioner
denied the approval, the Prospective Buyers, believing that such transfer was in their interest,

would have likely appointed the creditors’ committee and obtained consent.”

ALLEGED BREACHES OF THE BIT

The Claimant claims that the Respondent breached (1) the FET standard under Article II(6) of
the BIT, including the prohibition on denial of justice, and (2) several other BIT obligations.

1. The fair and equitable treatment standard
Article II(6) of the BIT provides:
ARTICLE ST

Treatment of Investment

6. Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection
and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.
Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary and discriminatory measures the management,
operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion or disposal of investments. Each
Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.*°

The Claimant contends that the Respondent breached the FET standard under Article I1(6) of the
BIT by: (i) failing to maintain a stable legal and business framework for Manchester's
3 ii) ir 's_ legiti ions; (iii) acting arbitrarily;

(iv) discriminating against (¥) acting inconsistently; and (vi) denying justice to

 

Manchester. The Parties’ arguments in respect of each of these contentions are summarized in

submissions regarding the FET standard (with the exception of their discussion of the relationship
between the FET standard and denial of justice, which is set out at paragraphs 175-188 above).

(a) The general scope of the standard
The Claimant's Position

198. The Claimant notes that the FET standard is not defined in the BIT. Referring to investment case
Jaw and legal commentators, the Claimant submits that the FET standard encompasses several
legal princi: i ing: (i) p ion of investor's legiti i (ii) iP:

(iii) compliance with contractual obligations; (iv) procedural propriety and due process; (v) good
faith; (vi) freedom from coercion and harassment; (vi) prohibition of discrimination, arbitrary
treatment, inconsistent State conduct and denial of justice; and (vii) obligation to maintain a
stable legal and business framework.”*? According to the Claimant, breach of any of these
principles entails a breach of the FET standard.” An act need not be “egregious and shocking
or involve bad faith” to amount to a violation of the FET standard.” Rather, the FET standard
“ensures that the foreign investor is not unjustly treated, in light of all the circumstances of the

case,"76*

199. The Claimant further submits that the FET standard is an embodiment of the rule of law, which
has been ibed as isting of equality, lity, ionality and (legal) certainty.”
Although the State is free to introduce new laws and regulations and to establish its own public
policies,””* the rule of law requires that Governments act in accordance with the rules that have

been previously fixed and announced, to make it possible for investors to “foresee how authority

requirements of the FET standard for a State to act upon public pressure to achieve short-term
goals” and that, where that happens, the judicial branch should “be a guardian of the rule of law

and ensure that the law is applied fairly and not arbitrarily."?"

200. The Claimant further submits that even if the Tribunal were to find that the Respondent’s

individual acts did not breach the FET standard, these acts cumulatively amount to a breach.”**

The Respondent's Position
201.

The Respondent submits that, “since the PET standard under Article I1(6) of the BIT requires
treatment not less than the treatment accorded by international law, Claimant has the burden of
proving that international law recognises that the FET standard encompasses all the elements
listed by Claimant.”” The Respondent argues that the Claimant “has failed to submit any
evidence of state practice or opinio juris to confirm that international law recognises the alleged
elements of the FET standard listed by Claimant, particularly that the FET standard encompasses

a prohibition on inconsistent state conduct, the obligation to maintain a stable legal and business

202. ‘The Respondent views the Claimant's allegations that the Respondent breached the FET standard
as being “baseless”.””’ For the avoidance of doubt, the Respondent additionally submits that
because Poland did not breach the FET standard, there was also “no composite effect of any

alleged measures that cumulatively breached the FET standard.”?”*

(b) Stable legal and business framework
The Claimant's Position

203. The Claimant submits that, pursuant to the FET standard, the host Stare must maintain a stable
legal and business framework, such that “[a]ny changes to the host State’s legislation, and even
the host State’s policies, after the investment is made, [are] done fairly, consistently and

predictably.”?” In the present case, the Claimant is of the view that the Respondent impermissibly

changed the legal framework by adopting the Apartment Buyer Protection Act, and by
retroactively applying the new policies underlying that Act to Manchester's Mortgages.

204. The Claimant asserts that, when its Mortgages were registered in 2006 and 2007, the Polish legal
framework provided that:
(a) Mortgages could be taken over real property on which development activities were being
carried out;

(b) Provided they were duly registered with the LMR, mortgages taken over real property were
enforceable against that property;

(c) In a bankruptcy scenario, the secured claims of mortgagees would enjoy priority over the
claims of the mortgagor’s unsecured creditors;

(d) Mortgages established first in time would enjoy priority over mortgages established later in
time;

(€) Mortgages of the same seniority in a bankruptcy proceedings would be equal before the
law; and

(f) Clients of real estate developers would not be subject to preferential treatment in those
developers’ bankruptcy proceedings.*”*

208, However, according to the Claimant, when (¥iivent bankrupt and the (ED Court of
Appeal refused to invalidate thE Mortgage, the Respondent yielded to public pressure
and changed its policy.?” Specifically, on 16 September 2011, it adopted the Apartment Buyer
Protection Act, which: (i) prioritized developers’ clients in bankruptcy proceedings and treated
them as a “super privileged” class of creditors; (ii) envisaged the transfer of apartments from the
developers’ bankruptcy estates to their clients; and (iii) was unclear and did not expressly regulate
how mortgagees would be satisfied upon the transfer of apartments to developers’ clients.?”°

206. In the Claimant's view, the evidence shows that the Prospective Buyers and, in particular, the
ERED Association, lobbied for protection to the Polish authorities and had a “significant
impact” on the adoption of the Apartment Buyer Protection Act.?”” The Claimant also maintains
§

that the Act was passed too quickly, following inadequate public consultation,””® and was

“heavily criticised” both before and after it was enacted.”

were applied retroactively to Manchester's Mortgages, in particular in the ED supreme
Court Ruling, the Supreme Court ruling in the (QM case, and when the Bankruptcy Count
approved the transfer of the Apartments to the Prospective Buyers.”*° According to the Claimant,

the Respondent thus used the new policies “to shift the financial burden of rescuing the

Prospective Buvers to a foreign investor — Manchester.”**!

208. Finally, the Claimant illustrates the lack of a stable legal framework by asserting that the

creditors were annulled in May 2015, after the needs of the Prospective Buyers had been

Second, the Respondent denics that the public authorities yielded to pressure exerted by the
Prospective Buyers in adopting the Apartment Buyer Protection Act.™° In the Respondent’s
view, the purpose of the Act was to “address the general problem of the growing wave of
insolvencies among Polish developers, which threatened to impact .,. thousands of families
87 To the extent (EEE case was specifically mentioned by MPs, the Respondent asserts
that this was only because it was considered typical of many similar cases nationwide.”** Thus,
in the Respondent’s view, the Claimant has overstated the involvement and impact of the

lobbying of the Prospective Buyers and the QD ssociation.”

Third, the Respondent asserts that the Apartment Buyer Protection Act had no impact on the
validity of the EEEED Mortgage or any of the Claimant’s rights, as the EEE Supreme
Court Ruling explicitly noted that the Act had not yet come into force and that “it had based its
judgment on laws which were in force on the date the judgment was passed.”?°°

Fourth, and finally, the Respondent submits that there was no connection between the adoption
of the Apartment Buyer Protection Act and the transfer of the Apartments to the Prospective
Buyers, as the transfer was based entirely on the law applicable to the Bankruptcy Proceedings,
and reflected the legal situation created by the decisions of the Polish courts regarding the

GRD CRB Mortgages.”

(c) Legitimate expectations

The Claimant's Position

214. The Claimant submits that an investor’s legitimate expectations are based on both “the host

State’s legal framework and any undertakings and representations made explicitly or implicitly
by the host State at the time when the investment was made” (upon which the investor relied
when deciding to pursue its investment). The Claimant further submits that. “if the State

assures an investor that the rights it has acquired under national law arc valid and enforceable

and it subsequently invalidates such rights, this frustrates the investor's legitimate

expectations.”?°*

Here, the Claimant contends that it entered into the Bond Purchase Agreement in November 2006
in the expectation that the receivables under that agreement would be secured by mortgages over
GERD sets.” This expectation was “wholly consistent with the then-existing Polish legal
framework relating to mortgages.” * Further, the Registry Court’s subsequent registration of the
Mortgages constituted a representation that the Polish State recognized the validity of the
Mortgages and considered them to be enforceable as a matter of law. It thus “gave rise to a
legitimate expectation that should (IED fail to redeem the Bonds ... Manchester's claims
could be satisfied from the proceeds of the sale of the QED: nd (EE roperties, with

priority overEEEB other existing, unsecured creditors ...”?

According to the Claimant, this legitimate expectation was frustrated when the Respondent took
the following actions preventing enforcement of th»: (GED Morzages: (i) the
issuance of the First, Second and Third Injunctions prohibiting the enforcement of the
Mortgage; (ii) the issuance of the Prosecutor’s Order prohibiting the sale of C=
Property; (iii) the enactment of the Apartment Buyer Protection Act: (iv) the issuance of the
GERD upreme Court Ruling invalidating the Mortgage; (v) the issuance of the
Supreme Court ruling in the GD case, which found that the > Mortgage was
unenforceable; and (vi) the approval by the Bankruptcy Court of the Bankruptcy Trustee’s

request for the transfer of the Apartments to the Prospective Buyers.”

The Claimant explains that it does not contend that Polish courts are completely precluded from
invalidating a mortgage registered in the LMR. Rather, the Claimant's position is that a registered
mortgage can only be invalidated in exceptional circumstances and on the basis of information
that was not known to the registry at the time of the registration.” In this regard, the Claimant
stresses that, at the time the ED: c GEM ortgages were registered, the Registry

Court was aware that the Prospective Buyers had unsecured claims toward QD Gad

218. The Claimant further emphasizes that, although Article 58 of the Polish Civil Code, which

provides for the invalidity of acts contrary to PSC, already existed at the time when its Mortgages
were established, the Claimant could not have known that thE upreme Court Ruling
would rely on that provision to invalidate the ED Mortgage. In this regard, the Claimant
asserts that, since “the fall of the post war communist regime up until the decision of the Supreme
Court in the EE asc, the Supreme Court had never invalidated a mortgage on the basis
of the [PSC]."°° The Claimant thus contends that “[e]ither the Supreme Court was wrong in
referring to [PSC] when invalidating the Mortgage, or the Registry Court should have
refused to register the GERM oreaze in the first place. In any event, Poland acted
inconsistently with respect to the a> See Mortgage and frustrated Manchester's

expectations.”*""

The Respondent's Position

219. The Respondent submits that the Claimant could not have had any legitimate expectations that

220.

the Mortgages would be enforceable.*””

First, the Respondent submits that international tribunals have affirmed that investors’
expectations are protected only if they are reasonable and well-founded,*”’ The Respondent refers
to Duke Energy v. Ecuador for the proposition that, when building up expectations, investors
must look at the bigger picture and take into account the social and cultural conditions in the host
State.*™ In light of these requirements, the Respondent contends that the Claimant could not have
had any legitimate expectations, because it “was aware that the establishment and enforcement
of Zz and Ee Mortgages, which would cause harm to several hundred

families, were unethical and against the moral values which are embodied in the [PSC]}."*°

Second, the Respondent argues that the Claimant cannot ground its alleged expectations on the

fact that the ED: GE ortgazes were registered in the LMR because, under

Polish law, registration does not validate or legitimize a mortgage established contrary to the law.

A right registered in the LMR is only “presumptively valid” and can be challenged by third

parties. The Respondent contends that it is not “unusual” for the registration of mortgages or

other property rights to be later overturned by the courts. Further, the Respondent asserts that the

Claimant’s investment = through the transfer of money under the Bond Purchase

Agreement in November 2006, was made before the mortgage deed for the ED roperty

was signed in January 2007. Consequently, the Claimant could not have had any legitimate
expectation that by transferring money Sa: it had made a secure investment.>”

222. Third, the Respondent avers that the Registry Court had no power to conduct evidentiary

proceedings to determine whether the Mortgages complied with PSC.“

The Respondent
explains that when examining an entry, the Registry Court only reviews the application and
supporting documents — if these do not give rise to doubt, the Court makes the entry as applied
for. In contrast, in proceedings addressing the question of validity of an entry in a register, the
court making the assessment is able to examine circumstances that go beyond those considered
when the entry was made.” Thus, in theEEED Supreme Court Ruling, the Supreme Court
took into account various circumstances that had not been known to the Registry Court and which
were irrelevant for the purpose of registration.*!” Accordingly, there is no inconsistency between
the LMR registration and the{EBsupreme Court Ruling.”

() The Compulsory Mortgages
The Claimant's Position
224, The Claimant recalls that the Cracow Regional Court first established the Compulsory Mortgages
in favour of some of the Prospective Buyers in the context of the Preliminary Agreement
Py di before the beginning of the Y P i After the
Preliminary Agreement Enforcement Proceedings were discontinued, the Supreme Court issued
a decision upholding the Compulsory Mortgages.
225. In this respect, the Claimant argues, first, that the decision of the IB Regional Court was

“highly unusual, as under Polish law, mortgages can secure only monetary claims,”*'? whereas
the Compulsory Mortgages were granted to secure the Prospective Buyers’ non-monetary claims
in the Preliminary Agreement Enforcement Proceeding (i.e., claims for the transfer of the
Apartments).*'? The Claimant relies in this respect on the opinion of its expert on Polish law,

Professor Swaczyna.*"

226. Second, the Claimant argues that the Compulsory Mortgages were granted by way of interim
relief and should therefore have been cancelled by operation of law upon the discontinuation of
the proceedings in which they were granted.** Accordingly, in upholding the Compulsory
Mortgages, the Supreme Court breached Polish law, “engaged in judicial activism” and acted

arbitrarily.*!°

228. In any event, the Respondent submits that the Prospective QED Buyers pursued both
monetary and non-monetary claims in the Preliminary Agreement Enforcement Proceedings:

they requested the transfer of the Apartments, as well as compensation.*'* The Compulsory
Mortgages were thus granted for these hybrid claims.*!? The Respondent submits that the
Claimant’s expert, Professor Swaczyna, confirmed at the hearing that 61.5% of the Compulsory

Mortgages secured monetary claims.*”°

229, Further, the Respondent maintains that the Supreme Court decision regarding the Compulsory
Mortgages was in accordance with Polish law and was not arbitrary. In the Respondent’s view,
the decision is “well-reasoned and rational,” as “{t]he Court gave a detailed explanation of its

with the logical it ion of Article 774 of

reasons and that, in

the [CCP] in connection with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, certain interim injunctions

survive after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings.” **!

230, Finally, the Respondent contends that the Claimant’s characterization of the Supreme Court’s
decision as “uphold[ing] the Compulsory Mortgages” is misleading, given that the Supreme
Court “was not asked to hear the case of the Prospective Buyers’ Compulsory Mortgages. but to
rule on an abstract legal issue submitted to it by the Court of Appeal mM UY Accordingly,
the Respondent contends that the Supreme Court decision “was issued without any regard to the

232. The Claimant further submits that, although the Order was later quashed by the courts, “it remains

arbitrary and can entail the State’s responsibility.”>*>

The Respondent's Position
233. The Respondent submits that it is well-settled and has been affirmed by investment tribunals and
academic writings that a State can breach international law only by “a final and binding measure

that is not or cannot be remedied upon appeal.”

234, The Respondent also disagrees with the Claimant’s allegation that the Prosecutor’s Order was

arbitrary.*””

(ii) ThE supreme Court Ruling

The Claimant's Position

238. According to the Claimant, the QED supreme Court Ruling, which invalidated the
GERD Mortgage as being contrary to PSC, was “based on discretion”, “arbitrary”, in
violation of the “rule of law”, and sought to favour the Prospective Buyers.°”* The Claimant
argues that “amidst vocal support by influential MPs and the EB erosecutor,”” the Supreme
Court retroactively applied the underlying policies of the Apartment Buyer Protection Act by
“resort[ing] to a new application of an archaic provision of Polish law” that “legal acts contrary
to the [PSC] are invalid.”*"° The Claimant contends that the ED Supreme Court Ruling
“shift{ed] the burden” of Poland’s failure to protect developers’ clients to the Claimant alone.**!

236. Relying on its second Polish law expert, Professor Sadurski, the Claimant states that the concept

a

of PSC is “a remnant of the post-war Communist legal regime,”*** but today should be understood
as void of any ideological connotations. According to the Claimant, it does not license judges to

apply their own moral preferences, but only values generally accepted in society, common to

>

Additionally, the Claimant submits that the Supreme Court has previously stated that PSC shall
only be invoked as a basis to invalidate legal acts in “exceptional” circumstances and shall not
be applied “arbitrarily or frivolously”.* By invalidating the GR ortgaze with
reference to PSC, the Claimant argues, the Supreme Court ruled against its own legal precedent,
as circumstances “were not exceptional”. The Claimant further argues that the QD
Supreme Court Ruling did not apply generally accepted values common to the European
tradition, but “parochial, idiosyncratic and own preferences favoring local creditors and

discriminating a foreign investor.”*7

The ruling thus reflected “an evident bias”, creating a
situation where the Prospective Buyers came to enjoy an even higher level of legal protection
than was envisaged in the Apartment Buyer Protection Act.*™* The Claimant further submits that
the Respondent did not adhere to the conditions for invocation and application of PSC as

determined by the Constitutional Tribunal in 2000.*°

238, The Claimant observes that the decision of the Supreme Court characterized QED conduct
in entering into the Non-Registration Clauses with the Prospective Buyers as “dishonest” and
concluded that the ED viortsage was “one of the planned results of the dishoncst conduct
of (BBD with [Manchester] being aware of that dishonesty.” The Court implied that
Manchester knowingly sought to take advantage of its position of priority over the Prospective
GREED Buyers, and ruled that it would be “inappropriate to burden” those buyers with the

full risk of failure of the ED evelopment." This reasoning, the Claimant argues, was

“economically absurd and irrational” for the reasons set forth below. *

First, the Claimant highlights that the economic purpose of a mortgage is to prioritize one creditor
over another. The mere existence of a mortgage is not a priori evidence of bad faith. Similarly,
the existence of unsecured creditors, “who willingly agreed to remain unsecured and thus exposed
to the risk of subordination, does not make entering into a mortgage an act of bad faith.”*#? The
Claimant also underlines that the Non-Registration Clauses were a standard market practice at
the time. In light of these factors, the Claimant asserts that it is “impossible” to understand
why the Supreme Court concluded that QE cted “dishonestfly}” and how it could imply
that the Claimant was wrong to secure its rights with the ED Mortgage.

Second, the Claimant submits that it is “wholly irrelevant” whether the Claimant was aware of
the existence and content of the Preliminary Agreements, since these agreements did not create
property rights to the GERD partments. The Claimant asserts that the Supreme Court
expected the Claimant (a financier) to disregard its own legitimate interest in securing rights via
mortgages (a permissible measure under Polish law and a common practice) in favour of the
interests of the unsecured Prospective Buyers. Professor Sadurski confirms that such “moral

heroism” (or “moral altruism”) is not an element of public morality in free societies, or of PSC.>%°

‘Third, the Claimant points out that, in invalidating the ortgage, the Supreme Court
took into account events subsequent to the grant of the Mortgages (.c. QED cefaut asa
result of an allegedly excessive and risky business). The Claimant maintains, however, that these
subsequent events were unforeseeable at the time of the grant of the Mortgages and so should not
have been considered.” The Claimant denies the Respondent's assertion noi: as not
in a strong financial position at the time (see paragraph 119 above). In any event, the Claimant
submits that even risky or excessive business activities cannot in and of themselves be considered

to be dishonest or contradictory to PSC.*"

242. Finally, the Claimant asserts that the Supreme Court made an “egregious procedural error” by
departing from the Court of Appeal’s factual findings that: (i) “there was no evidence of an
agreement between aa and Manchester seeking to prevent the satisfaction of the
Prospective Buyers’ claims”; and (ii) “there was no evidence of base behaviour or of a conspiracy
by Qn Manchester aimed at harming the Prospective Buyers.”**° The Claimant alleges
that instead of accepting the factual findings of the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court made
new findings that: (GD was “dishonest”, and Manchester was aware of this dishonesty;
(ii) eS business activity was “careless”, “irresponsible” and “ill-considered”; and
(i) GD permitted Manchester “to take the initiative” by proposing to increase the price of
flats for the Prospective Buyers. **' According to the Claimant, the Supreme Court had no
authority to make new factual findings and, by doing so, failed to accord Manchester’s investment

due process.***

The Respondent's Position

243. The Respondent maintains that thE vpreme Court Ruling was adopted in accordance
with both due process and Polish law. The Respondent thus asserts that PSC are “an overriding
principle in Polish contract law” embodied in the general duty of acting in good faith, which
imposes a duty on contracting parties to deal with each other honestly and fairly, so as not to

393

violate the rights of the other party or any third party.**’ The Respondent opposes the Claimant’s
allegation that PSC are “archaic”, observing that they have formed the basis of “several hundred
judgments and decisions” of Polish courts and can even be found as part of the international legal
order.*** The Respondent asserts that “one in every 20 awards rendered by Polish courts refers to
[PSC]."**° It adds that PSC are an expression of the European heritage and culture and of

generally accepted social values.**°

The Respondent denies that the Supreme Court was politically influenced in making its ruling,**'
and further denies that the Supreme Court retroactively applied the underlying policies of the
Apartment Buyer Protection Act. The Respondent explains that there is a consistent practice
of taking into account the fundamental purpose of new legislation when applying old legislation,
that no provision of the Apartment Buyer Protection Act was cited, and that the only purpose of
referring to it was to show that the moral norms underlying the Court’s decision had also “won
the legislator’s approval.” The Respondent describes the Supreme Court’s reasoning as
follows:

The Supreme Court concluded that if the circumstances of a case so require, particularly if a

dishonest developer goes bankrupt and the buyers have already paid him a substantial amount

of money, it is the duty of the courts to seek to ensure an appropriate level of legal protection

for the buyers of apartments. The Supreme Court observed that “the need for such protection

also arises from relevant constitutional norms (Art. 64 sec. 2 and Art. 76 of the Constitution).”

The Court stressed, however, that protection should be sought “within the framework of existing

system of laws which are in force at the time of passing the ruling (Art. 58 § 2, Art. 3531 of the
Civil Code).”

The Respondent further explains that the Constitution of Poland contains provisions to protect

the housing needs of citizens.*®* One of these provisions is Article 75(1), which states:

Public authorities shall pursue policies conducive to satisfying the housing needs of citizens, in
particular combating homelessness, promoting the development of low-income housing and
supporting activities aimed at acquisition of a home by each citizen.2

10 ES AS TS

The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s suggestion that the Supreme Court demanded that
Manchester should have exhibited “moral altruism” toward the Prospective Buyers**
demonstrates a cynical and merciless approach to the interest and rights of other people. The
Respondent notes that it is well-established that the law accords special protection to consumers

as weaker parties.’

Further, the Respondent argues that the Supreme Court did not take any subsequent events (such
as ED bankruptcy) into account when assessing the Claimant’s actions. According to the
Respondent, QED lack of strong financial standing was evident at the time the Mortgages
were given >. Manchester (see paragraph 121 above).*”?

Finally, with respect to the Claimant’s argument that the Supreme Court departed from the Court

The Claimant submits that lack of clarity and consistency in the legal system may result in
arbitrariness, even unintentionally.*” In the present case, the Claimant asserts that the Polish
courts rendered inconsistent rulings in respect of the QED Mortgage on the one hand and
the ED nc Ql Mortgages on the other.’

With respect to the GEM origage, the Claimant thus asserts that, while the Supreme Court
invalidated the GEEEEMorigaze, in the GD nd GD cases it found that re
Mortgage was valid, “notwithstanding that both of these mortgages were established in the same
circumstances,” under the same notarial deed.*”” The Claimant emphasizes that the Court of
Appeal made the same factual findings in respect of both Mortgages: (i) that Manchester did not
aim to harm the Prospective Buyers; (ii) that Manchester provided financing to Go:
GERD other investments; and (iii) tha

The Claimant further submits that it is not only the Supreme Court’s finding in respect of the
validity of the Mortgages that was different, but also its approach to the factual findings of the
Court of Appeal. While in the Dn cB -ases the Supreme Court considered itself bound
by the Court of Appeal’s factual findings, it disregarded them in its decision regarding the
GER onzage”

The Respondent submits that the (EB upreme Court Ruling and the Supreme Court
decisions in the (ED nd QP cases were consistent.*°

Thus, in both the QB ase and the (EER case, the Supreme Court arrived at the same
that the i or of the against the Prospective
Buyers was unethical and contrary to the social norms embodied in PSC.**! Specifically, the
Supreme Court found the (ED Mortgage to be invalid because it contradicted PSC under
Article 58(2) of the Civil Code, and similarly found that Manchester’s request to enforce the
GD Morigage was an “abuse of law under Article 5 of the Polish Civil Code as it violated
the [PSC].°"*? While the Supreme Court abstained from passing judgment on the validity of the
GD Mortgage under Article 58(2) of the Civil Code, this was “only for procedural reasons,”
as the Court of Appeal had made factual findings by which the Supreme Court was bound.**? In
the Respondent's view, the slightly different conclusions of the Supreme Court were justified by
the fact that it was presented with different sets of facts in the two cases on which to give a legal
opinion and accordingly took a “harsher” view of GED ctivity in the ruling regarding the
GD ortgaze.™
The Respondent further submits that while in the QB ase, the Supreme Court declined to
declare the QED Mortgage over QED apartment to be invalid, it did so because certain
key facts established by the lower courts in thease were different than in LL =
Case." In particular was not able to prove “the harmful purpose of the ea
Mortgage, the transfer of the investment risk or the privileging of the Claimant...” **
Additionally, QD unlike the Prospective EEE Buyers, was not a consumer.**”

(v) The transfer of the Apartments to the Prospective Buyers
The Claimant's Position

259. The Claimant contends that the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the transfer of the Apartments to
the Prospective Buyers was “arbitrary” because it lacked “any rational economic
considerations.’*** The transfer reduced QED bankruptcy estate. It therefore ran against the
legal standards underlying bankruptcy proceedings, “which should be conducted in the interest

of all creditors, not the few arbitrarily chosen by the Bankruptcy Court."*”

260. The Claimant contests the Respondent's explanation that the Bankruptcy Trustee had to take into
account the “human context” and the complexity that would have been involved in evicting the
occupants of the Apartments.*” The Claimant argues that the building had not yet been “handed
over for use” and so any occupation would have been illegal.*”’ The Claimant also argues that
even if illegal occupation had taken place, the eviction process could have been completed in
time to sell the Apartments.*? The Claimant adds that, “had Poland indeed acted with the
intention of helping the Prospective Buyers meet their housing needs, it would not have approved
the transfer of commercial premises to the Prospective Buyers or the transfer of units to

commercial companies, at other creditors” costs.”**

The Respondent's Position

261. The defends the rati ity of | the to the Prospective Buyers.
First, the Respondent asserts that multiple attempts to sell the QD Property in the
Bankruptcy Proceedings (at successively lower asking prices) had been unsuccessful. On this
basis, the Respondent argues that it would have been “devoid of any sense” to continue to try and

sell the QED roperty.* Moreover, even if the ED roperty had eventually been

sold, the Respondent argues, “the likely purchase price would not have been sufficient to satisfy

all the secured creditors, let alone unsecured creditors such as Manchester.”*°*

For this reason, the Respondent also submits that transferring ownership of the >
Apartments would not have entailed a loss to the bankruptcy estate.*” In the Respondent’s view,
the estate in fact benefitted from the transfer as it meant that “169 of the 172 secured creditors
[the Prospective Buyers] had been satisfied,” bringing =z total debt down by

approximately PLN@D*”

As to the Claimant’s suggestion that the Prospective Buyers ought to have made additional
payments to the bankruptcy estate in return for the transferred Apartments, the Respondent states
that, considering that at the time of the transfer he Apartinents “were below the
standard agreed in the Preliminary Agreement,” such argument is “ill-founded and ignores the
circumstances of the case.”*°* The Respondent notes that the Prospective Buyers who had not
paid the full amount of the Purchase Price were obliged to pay the remaining price to the
GERD Association, which in due course undertook to finish the construction of the

GED" operty.”

Finally, the Respondent states that the Claimant is wrong to imply that the Bankruptcy Trustee
should have evicted the Prospective Buyers. The Respondent asserts that “eviction was not an
option” because it had not been finally decided whether the QED Property would be
liquidated through sale or by performance of the Preliminary Agreements.” In addition, the
Bankruptcy Trustee was not under any obligation to evict the Prospective Buyers from the
GERD Property. The Respondent notes that it is common in bankruptcy proceedings for
evictions to be left for the purchaser to conduct as it: (i) enables the bankruptcy estate to avoid
the costs of eviction and enforcement; (ii) decreases the time in which liquidation can take place;
and (iii) allows an amicable solution to be found between the purchaser and the residents.*”
Moreover, the Respondent posits that evicting the Prospective Buyers would have caused “bad

press” and would have buried any chance of selling the property.”

(e) Discrimination
The Claimant's Position

265. The Claimant submits that “it was subjected to discriminatory treatment by the Respondent, given
the treatment accorded | a financial institution controlled by the Polish State.”*? Relying
on the definition contained in Saluka v. Czech Republic, the Claimant submits that a State’s
conduct is considered discriminatory “if (i) similar cases are (ii) treated differently (iii) and

without reasonable justification.”**

266. The Claimant asserts that Manchester and @ are comparable entities that were objectively in
similar situations, as they were both lenders that provided financing toto enable it to
pursue its development activities. Both secured their loans through mortgages over the
ERR ? operty, which were registered in the LMR by the Registry Court.“

267. Notwithstanding their “like situations”, the Claimant contends that Manchester and Qi) were
treated differently by the Polish courts. The circumstances invoked in the QD supreme
Court Ruling for invalidating he Mortgage were equally present in the case of the
aa Mortgage, yet that mortgage was not found to be in breach of PSC and was not
invalidated.’ In particular, both Manchester and QED were aware tha QD pce unsecured
creditors, both were aware of the Non-Registration Clauses, and in both cases the risk of
GERD sciivity fell more strongly on the Prospective Buyers than on the secured lenders.*”
The Claimant thus contends that although courts may “change their minds” and reverse
themselves in a later decision, the reasoning in the two Supreme Court decisions regarding the
RD: GD Mortgages “does not reveal a change of view following further reflection
or more informative advocacy but simply a contrived difference in result ... explained by a
willingness to disadvantage the foreign investor, Manchester, but not the Polish State-controlled

bank.“

it was established in connection with a credit facility extended for the purposes of purchasing the

Clauses.‘*4 The Respondent emphasizes that “the purpose of the claim secured by the mortgage
and the creditors’ awareness of the mortgage, may be considered in assessing whether the [PSC]

were violated.”"”°

276. The Respondent also argues that the Claimant’s claim of discrimination must fai! because it is
conditional upon the Tribunal finding that the EBD supreme Court Ruling did not breach
the BIT. Should the Tribunal make this finding, it then needs to analyze whether the ruling
upholding the GMorizage is in line with Polish and international law. The Respondent
proffers that the Tribunal should rely on the guidelines offered by Professor Sadurski in his expert
opinion, based on which it will find that the Supreme Court correctly upheld the Morigage.
With this finding, coupled with the earlier finding that the Supreme Court correctly invalidated
the ED vortgage, the grounds for discrimination “simply disappear”.*”*

(f) Inconsistent actions
The Claimant's Position

The Claimant submits that the “inconsistent and self-contradictory treatment of Manchester's
investment by two Polish organs in itself is a breach of the FET, which encompasses the

prohibition of inconsistent treatment.”*”*

Specifically, the Claimant submits that the Respondent acted inconsistently when its Supreme
Court invalidated the QM origave afler that Mortgage was duly registered in the LMR
by the GB cgistry Court. This argument is summarized in the section on legitimate
expectations at paragraphs 214-218 above.

280. In addition, the Claimant submits that the Supreme Court rendered inconsistent decisions in

respect of the ED nc GERM ortgages, as described in the section on arbitrary

actions at paragraphs 251-253 above.

281. The Respondent submits that it acted consistently,**! as described in the sections on legitimate

expectations and arbitrary actions at paragraphs 219-222 and 255-257 above. respectively

(g) Denial of justice and external interference in the judicial proceedings

The Claimant's Position

282. The Claimant submits that, when assessing denial of justice claims, investment tribunals have
analyzed whether: (i) a court’s decision is arbitrary, unjust or idiosyncratic; (ii) a court's decision
lacks legal logic or is based on “manifestly insufficient grounds and irrelevant arguments”; (iii) a
court’s decision is based on “insubstantial evidence or is bereft of a basis in law”; (iv) justice is
administered in a “seriously inadequate way”; (v) the judiciary “used its powers for improper
purposes”; and (vi) the judiciary acted intentionally against the investor to harm its investments.

283. The Claimant also submits that a denial of justice may occur, not only through procedural
shortcomings, but also as a result of the substance of a court decision. In its view, this is
established as a matter of customary international law‘? and by investment treaty case law.‘
While the Claimant agrees that an international tribunal considering denial of justice claims may

not act as an appellate court, it also submits that “it is appropriate for them to analyse the
reasoning of the decisions of a host State’s courts in order to determine whether there has been a
breach of the host State’s obligation under public international law.”** The Claimant adds that
denial of justice constitutes a breach of the FET standard, and can also amount to an independent

breach of customary international law.*?°

f) Finally, the Polish Parliament enacted the Apartment Buyer Protection Act which

encouraged the Supreme Court to invalidate ‘nA Mortage.

287. The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s argument that the Public Prosecutor was “legally obliged”
to join the proceedings in the EME "2se.“” In the Claimant's view, a legal duty to join
civil proceedings only exists in respect of certain categories of cases (¢,g. family law cases).
Public prosecutors have a discretion whether to join a case for the invalidation of a mortgage, but
it is unusual for them to exercise that discretion. The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s statistics
on prosecutor interventions, arguing that they are misleading because they include cases in which
the participation of a public prosecutor is mandatory. The Claimant asserts that, in this case, the
Public Prosecutor was “inspired” by MP Jaroslaw Gowin to join the ED case to increase
pressure on the courts to invalidate the (¥EEEEEMortgage.“" The Claimant also points out

that certain documents reveal the involvement of the Human Rights Ombudsman. *”

The Respondent's Position

288. As described above, the Respondent argues that the decisions of the Polish courts were not
arbitrary, inconsistent or unfair, and accordingly submits that it has not denied justice to the

Claimant.

289. The Respondent also objects to the Claimant’s allegation that there was “external interference”
in the judicial proceedings, arguing that the Claimant has failed to identify irregularity in the
actions of the Polish authorities and has failed to prove that they had any influence over the
proceedings.***

290. In particular, the Respondent argues that it was the Prosecutor’s statutory duty to participate in
the QED case.“ It adds that it is not unusual for the Prosecutor to be involved in Polish
civil p dings.’ A public will join civil p ings if required in order to protect

the public interest or citizens’ rights and property. The QE: asc, the Respondent states,

29)

The Respondent also denies the Claimant’s claim that the Public Prosecutor General “call[ed] for
the invalidation of the (EEBMortgage.” The Respondent explains that the Supreme Court
(in the MMB} ase) had requested the Public Prosecutor General to express his opinion as to the
grounds for the cassation filed by Mr. QB uccessors. The Public Prosecutor General was
obliged to respond to this request and accordingly provided an opinion in which she concluded
only that “the cassation appeal should be allowed by the Supreme Court, given the infringements

of substantive law that exist in this case.”“*

292. Regarding the involvement of MPs, the Respondent submits that they are obliged to address
problems notified to them by citizens, and that their actions in response to he

Bankruptcy Court to “protect the Prospective Buyers” as the Claimant alleges.*” Rather, the MPs
expressed only their general hope that the social aspect of the case would be considered and that

“jt will be possible to work out a solution satisfactory to all parties.”**!

2. Other alleged breaches of the BIT

294. In addition to its argument that the Respondent breached the FET standard under Article 11(6) of

the BIT, including through a denial of justice, the Claimant submits that the Respondent breached
its obligations under the BIT to: (i) treat investment and associated activities on a
nondiscriminatory basis (Article II(1)); (ii) not impair by arbitrary or discriminatory (or
unreasonable)** treatment the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment,
acquisition, expansion or disposal of investments (Article II(6)); (iii) provide investments with
full protection and security (Article 11(6)); (iv) provide effective means of asserting claims and
enforcing rights with respect to investments (Article II(7)); and (v) not expropriate except for a
public purpose, in a nondiscriminatory manner, upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective
compensation, and in accordance with due process of law and the gencral principles of treatment

provided for in Article II(6) of the BIT (Article VII).

295. In making these claims, the Claimant takes issue with the same actions of the Respondent as

those which it submits breached the Respondent’s FET obligations (including the prohibition on
denial of justice). The Respondent denies any breach of the BIT. In light of the Tribunal’s
findings in respect of FET and denial of justice, set out in Section VI.B below, the Tribunal
considers it unnecessary to set out the Parties’ arguments on these other alleged breaches in any

greater detail

This standard, the Claimant submits, is confirmed by Article 36 of the ILC Articles, which states:

1, The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to
compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such damage is not made good by
restitution.

2. The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits
insofar as it is established.
The Claimant submits that it cannot be compensated by way of restitution (/.¢., through a
reinstatement of the QD Mortgage) because the QD 4 parents have already
been transferred to the Prospective QED Buyers. Accordingly, the Claimant seeks

monetary compensation.“

The Respondent's Position

299.

The Respondent submits that the Chorzéw full reparation standard is “not universally accepted
for assessing damages for a breach of the BIT.’**” In the present case, the Respondent argues, the
standard for calculating compensation in the event of expropriation is set out in Article VII of the
BIT, which provides that compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the
investment, The Respondent argues that since the BIT does not provide for a different standard
for breaches of other provisions of the BIT, the standard in Article VII should be applied to

calculate compensation for such other breaches. **

2. Causation

The Claimant's Position

300.

With respect to causation, the Claimant first states that, but for the illegal actions of the
Respondent that prevented the enforcement of the QED Mortgage (the First, Second and
Third Injunctions, the Prosecutor’s Order and the Supreme Court esa Ruling),
Manchester would have been able to enforce its EEEEMortgage in 2012 and could have
re-invested the funds received, Instead, the Claimant was preoccupied with legal battles in the

Polish courts and was eventually relegated to the status of an unsecured creditor with respect to
the ED roperty in QP sankruptey Proceedings.*”

received. The Claimant adds that it incurred significant legal costs in the proceedings concerning
‘he GED Morzage.*°

302. Third, the Claimant recalls that the Respondent granted Compulsory Mortgages to the
Prospective Buyers and later upheld them, declined to invalidate the (EB Mortgage, and
transferred he CD. Apartments to the Prospective Buyers. But for these
actions, the Claimant submits, “the size of ‘eneral bankruptcy estate would have been
larger and accordingly, Manchester could have satisfied a larger portion of its claims on a pro
rata basis (even despite the invalidation of the ez Mortgage and prevention of

enforcement of the EM ortgages).”**!

The Respondent's Position

303. The Respondent submits that it is well-established in international law that a proximate cause has
to be shown between the act complained of and the alleged damage. The Respondent adds that

the burden of proof lies with the claiming party.“

304. In the present case, the Respondent submits that the cause of any damage connected to the
GERD vo perty and Mortgage was the Bankruptcy Trustee’s failure to sell the QD
Property, not any action of the Respondent. Thus, to succeed, the Claimant must show that in the
absence of the events constituting the Respondent's alleged BIT breaches, the sale would have
been made.* In the Respondent’s view, however, the Claimant has failed 10 demonstrate this.

Specifically, the Respondent contends that if there was any possibility of selling he
Property through Manchester’s enforcement proceedings against GERD ritiates on
24 November 2008, this possibility was not hindered by the First, Second and Third Injunction

305.

a

for the following reasons: (i) the First Injunction did not prohibit Manchester from enforcing its
mortgage because it was issued against QD Gi) the Second Injunction against Manchester
did not, in its effect, stop the enforcement proceedings; and (iii) the Third Injunction against
Manchester, which did stop the enforcement proceedings, was issued only a month and a few
days before QB eclared bankruptcy, while the enforcement proceedings were not
sufficiently advanced to have allowed a sale of the(EEEED roperty within that month.**

The Respondent also contends that if there was any possibility of selling za roperty
in QB sankruptcy Proceedings, this possibility was not halted by the Second or Third

Injunctions because these decisions did not have an effect on the Bankruptcy Proceedings.‘

With regard to the alleged breaches of the BIT at the Bankruptcy Proceedings stage (the
Prosecutor's Order, the granting of and failure to annul the Compulsory Mortgages, the
GERD supreme Court Ruling and the confirmation of the Mortgage), the Respondent
contends that they did not prevent the Bankruptcy Trustee from selling the QD
Property.**” Of these, the only act that suspended the sale was the Prosecutor's Order, but this
was only for seven months at an early stage of the Bankruptcy Proceedings. The remaining three
events did not “in any way result in prohibition on selling or suspension of sale of the

Property,” as the Trustee could sell or transfer the property at any time.***

In respect of the Supreme Court’s invalidation of the (EEE Mortgage, the Respondent
argues that it did not prevent the Bankruptcy Trustee from trying to sell the QD
Property.” However, as a matter of fact, the Bankruptcy Trustee was unable to sell the
GERD Property. He attempted to do so four times from April 2013 to March 2014, but

received no offers.‘

entailed “the loss of Manchester's status as a secured creditor with respect to the 7
Property” (the GD arn”): Should the Tribunal consider that the invalidation of the
GERD Morigaze did not constitute a breach of the BIT, the Claimant seeks compensation
for: (i) the loss suffered by the Claimant as result of the Supreme Court judgment in 1

estate and the Claimant's inability to satisfy its claims as a result of the Respondent's transfer of

The Claimant explains that Mr. O’Brien assumed that; (i) if the Bankruptcy Proceedings had
taken a normal course. the ED roperry would have been sold by 31 December 2012;
and (ii) the proceeds from the sale of the ED roperty would have been distributed to the
secured creditors, such as the Claimant, by 31 March 2013.**? These assumptions are based on
the Bankruptcy Trustee’s initial plans and the average length of bankruptcy proceedings of real

estate developers in Poland.***

Mr. O’Bricn rejects the Respondent’s experts’ contention that the GED soperty would
have been sold no earlier than on 27 June 2014. He considers, first, that the sale process as it
actually occurred was affected by numerous actions taken by the Respondent, including the
Prosecutor's Order, the First Instance GER ing, the Second Instance QED
Ruling, the (ED supreme Count Ruling, and the decision to transfer ownership to the
Prospectiv (ED Buyers. Second, Mr. O’Brien argues that the Respondent’s experts did
not consider the documentation relating to, and the events surrounding, the Bankruptcy Trustee’s
tenders to sell the Property, and thus did not take into account the fact that the failure to sell was
due to “the events which were the aftermath and direct consequence of the invalidation of
Manchester’s Mortgages, i.e. the option to transfer the apartments to the QED Buyers.
Mr. O’Brien also suggests that several actions taken by the Bankruptcy Trustee appear “not to be
genuine actions aimed at selling the Propeny but rather [to be] designed to limit the
potential interest in the Property” and to decrease the offer price to “a level
comparable with the claims by the (EID Buyers against the bankrupt estate."*°

Accordingly, the Claimant's valuation expert, Mr. Grzesik, calculates the value of Caz
Property as at 31 December 2012 and concludes that on that date it could have been sold for
am on the assumption that hz Property was unoccupied. The
Claimant justifies this “non-occupation” assumption by pointing out that: (i) the Bankruptcy
‘Trustee was under the obligation to ensure that the (EB Property was free of occupants;
and that (ii) at the time of valuation, the {IEEE partments had not received an occupancy

322. As tothe value for which thE’ roperty could have been sold, the Respondent’s experts
submit that Mr. Grzesik’s valuation should be adjusted downward by 33 % to reflect: (i) the
distress of selling a property in the course of bankruptcy proceedings; (ii) the fact that the
apartments were occupied by the Prospective (EEE Buyers;*°! (iii) the fact that the actual
construction costs to complete the (ED propery were higher than the amounis estimated

earlier than on 27 June 2014™ and that the proceeds would have been distributed to the Claimant

on 31 December 2014.°”’ They justify using 27 June 2014 as the valuation date by noting that it

is the Respondent’s position that the sales process for the EEE roperty was not affected

by any actions taken by the Respondent. Since the Bankruptcy Trustee unsuccessfully tried to

sell the EID roperty on four occasions (that is, on 16 April 2013, 27 May 2013, 30 July

The Claimant's Position

324, According to the Claimant, the QE arm consists of damage arising from the Supreme
Court decision in the QED case that the GMMortgeze was unenforceable, which
weakened the Claimant’s ability to satisfy its claim under the Bond Purchase Agreement against
the QD apartment.” To value the QP Harm, Mr. O’Brien calculates “what amount
Manchester would have recovered under the ED Mortgage, had the GEM orizage
not been held to be unenforceable.”*'' Although the GEM origage secured a nominal
amount of PLN@QEEED the Claimant could have recovered no more than the value of the

The Respondent's Position

338. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal should apply a risk-free rate. Yield rates of Government
bonds are a “widely accepted approximation of the risk free rate.”*“* In the case of PLN, this is
the rate on Polish Government bonds, currently at 1.78%.5*

339. In the Respondent’s view, there are no grounds for interest decisions being based on the rates of

return of a specific entity, especially the rate of return of an entity other than the Claimant.

4. The issue of double recovery

The Respondent's Position

340. The Respondent asserts that there is a risk of double recovery because “in parallel to these
proceedings Claimant has been enforcing EE sebt in the bankruptcy proceedings and from
third parties” and there is a “high probability, the Claimant will recover in the bankruptcy
proceedings at eas LN as a secured creditor, and further amounts as an unsecured
creditor."**7 The Claimant is further enforcing its claim against a property at Twardowskiego
Street, which was valued at over PLN QED

The Respondent asserts that it is uncontested that there was a debt secured by the id

clients in respect of the pending Polish court proceedings.”** According to the Respondent, this
proposal cannot be implemented in a way that would properly secure the interests of the
Respondent without a settlement. Further, any such settlement would have to provide the
Respondent with appropriate tools to monitor the performance of the obligations assumed by the
Claimant. It would require a complex document, as the Claimant would need to be well-motivated
to continue the enforcement of its claims in an efficient manner. It would also “require that the
Respondent sets a team responsible for monitoring of the Claimant’s actions, which would cause

an unreasonable burden for the Respondent.”**?

The Claimant's further proposal that “the Tribunal award the full amount of damages on
condition that the Claimant undertakes to withdraw the claims pending in Poland against
GERD bankruptcy estate and other debtors in relation to the Bond Purchase Agreement, save
for pre- and post-award interest and costs” is equally unacceptable to the Respondent.** The
Respondent submits that this proposal would amount to the “Respondent paying the Claimant all

the amounts it had not recovered up until present date. and indirectly making a de facto donation
to an unknown group off EE creditors.”**

Instead, the Respondent proposes that the Tribunal address the risk of double recovery by issuing
an award on liability and, if it finds Poland liable for breach of the BIT, deferring its award on
quantum until all enforcement and bankruptcy proceedings have come to an end. In the
alternative, it proposes that the Tribunal issue a final award but deduct any amounts that
Manchester can still potentially recover in the bankruptcy and enforcement proceedings from the

amount of awarded damages, if any.**°

The Claimant's Position

345, The Claimant recalls that the ortgage was invalidated in 2012 and asserts that, since

then, Manchester has been unable to recover its claim in full. Accordingly. in its view, the
prospect of recovery of the outstanding amount from the current bankruptcy or enforcement

proceedings is remote.**

The Claimant further argues that “Manchester may incur further losses” as a result of the

GERD supreme Court Ruling. Since the ruling, Manchester has been implicated in

multiple proceedings by various entities secking invalidation of further securities of Manchester,

including the mortgage over the ED property. There are also two pending class

actions against Manchester by Prospective Buyers who claim damages of PLNQ@ED on the
grounds that the Supreme Court held that Manchester’s mortgages were contrary to PSC.**

To address any risk of double recovery with respect to payments that may be received before the
Tribunal issues a final award in these proceedings, Manchester offers to “update its damage
calculations with reference to any payments that Manchester may receive before the award is

issued.”

With respect to payments that Manchester may receive after the Award is rendered, the Claimant
submits that it would be up to the Polish courts to address any issues of double recovery, as the
Polish authorities will take into account the Tribunal’s Award “before ordering any subsequent
payments to Manchester in the course of pending enforcement or bankruptcy proceedings.”**'
The Claimant refers to Chevron v. Ecuador, where the tribunal held that “Claimant's recovery in
the arbitration should not be reduced based on the uncertain possibility of a favourable outcome
in the national proceedings.”* The Claimant avers that this internationally recognized position

is also recognized by Polish law.**

The Claimant further contends that, should the Tribunal wish to address the issue of double
recovery in its Award, this is possible, and that the Claimant’s “undertaking to withdraw its
claims pending in Poland, upon receipt of payment from Poland, or its undertaking to reimburse
Poland in the amount of the proceeds that Manchester may subsequently receive ... can be easily
accommodated in the arbitral award, and this would eliminate any risk, however remote, of
double recovery.”*** The Claimant objects to the Respondent's proposal that the Tribunal defer
its Award on damages or reduce the Claimant’s damages by the amount that can potentially be

recovered in the proceedings in Poland, as it would mean that the Claimant would be further

The Respondent requests that the Tribunal order the Claimant to pay all costs, disbursements and

The Respondent opposes the Claimant’s request for reimbursement of the costs incurred in the

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

JURISDICTION

The Respondent has raised three objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, namely that there
‘was no protected investment under the BIT, that the Claimant acted in bad faith, and that the
Tribunal is not competent to review the substance of the Polish courts’ judgments unless there is

denial of justice.

1 Was there an investment?

The Respondent argues that: (i) the purchase of the Bonds is a commercial activity and does not
fall within the ordinary meaning of investment; (ii) the BIT does not contain a precise definition
of investment and it is necessary to take into account the meaning of investment in international
law; and (iii) the so-called Sa/ini test is applicable and not met by the purchase of the Bonds by

the Claimant.*”°

According to Article I(1)(b) of the BIT, the term “investment” includes:

(i) tangible and intangible property, including rights such as mortgages, liens and pledges;
(ii) a company or shares of stock, or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;

(iii) a. claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an
investment;

(iv) intellectual property which includes, rights relating to: literary and artistic works, including
sound recordings, patent rights, industrial designs, semiconductor mask works, trade secrets and
trademarks, service marks, and trade names; and

(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law.
The BIT defines “commercial activity” as “activities carried on by nationals or companies of a
Party related to the sale or purchase of goods and services and the granting of franchises or rights

under license, which are not investments or related activities” (Article I(1)(i)).

The Tribunal will interpret the terms of the BIT “in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and

7

purpose.” as provided in Article 31 of the VCLT.

The Tribunal notes that commercial activity is defined in the negative, as an activity that is not
an investment or related to it, Hence, to interpret the definition, the Tribunal needs first to
determine what is an investment under the BIT. Furthermore, the last phrase of the definition,
“which are not investments or related activities,” is ambiguous; it may be read to mean that some
of these activities may be investments or related to investments. The inclusion of the same term

~ “licenses” — under “investment” and “commercial activity” adds to the ambiguity.

The initial definition of “investment” in Article I(1)(b) is somewhat circular in that “investment”
is defined “as every kind of investment.” The specific list of “included” categories that follows
illustrates what the parties to the BIT intended to include under the general term of investment.
They left the definition open to include other possible ways to invest, but ensured that the
inyestments listed would be included. This list provides guidance to the Tribunal on the BIT

parties’ understanding of what is an investment.
According to the Claimant, its investment consists of:

a) In relation to the Bond Purchase Agreement concluded with
(i) The payment of PLN| in exchange for the Bonds issued at such
face value, as financing to: estate projects in Poland; and
(ii) Claims, arising under the terms of the Bond Purchase Agreement, for the payment of
money on presentation of coupons and at maturity of the Bonds, which were crystallised in
the Payment Order and acknowledged in the Bankruptcy Proceedings; and

b) Manchester's rights arising out of the QED 21d QED Mortgages, which were
acquired to secure the receivables under the Bond Purchase Agreement.*”*

 

As described, the investment of the Claimant in the form of Bonds secured by mortgages would
fall within the categories specifically included in Article 1(1)(b): (i) the Bonds represent a claim
to money lent B>y the Claimant for real estate development, an economic activity; and
(ii) the secured Bonds also fit under the category of interests in the assets —! Given the
definition of “commercial activity” in the BIT, ifan activity fits under one of the listed categories
of investment, then, prima facie, the activity concemed will qualify as an investment and not as

an excluded “commercial activity”.

The Respondent has argued that, because of the lack of precision in the definition of investment

in the BIT, the Tribunal needs to take into account the meaning of investment in international

Jaw.*” On the other hand, the Claimant contends that, if an investment qualifies as such “in

accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and

in light of its object and purpose,” it would be contrary to the VCLT to have recourse to other

means of interpretation, including jurisprudence from other arbitral tribunals under other treaties
such as the ICSID Convention. **°

The Tribunal agrees that prima facie the Claimant did make and maintain an investment in the
Respondent State within the definition of Article I(1)(b) of the BIT. In order nonetheless to
dispose of the Respondent’s contention, however, that the Tribunal should “take into account the
meaning of investment in international law” and, in particular, apply the so-called Sa/ini test, the

Tribunal will proceed to address it.

‘The Tribunal is mindful that there is no agreed definition of investment in international law. The
definitions, if any, vary in the treaties and the jurisprudence. The characteristics of an investment,
as argued by the Respondent, have more commonly been developed and analyzed by tribunals in
ICSID cases because of the complete lack of definition of investment in the ICSID Convention.
In summing up investment cases jurisprudence, the Respondent states that, in order to qualify as
an investment, an asset must at least fulfil three criteria: contribution, duration and risk. While
the Tribunal does not endorse the Respondent’s view that these criteria reflect customary
international law,**! the Tribunal now proceeds to consider those three criteria, frequently

referred to, in relation to this arbitration.

The Respondent has noted that some tribunals have added to the three above-mentioned criteria
the requirements that the investment be made in good faith and contribute to the economic
development of the host State. The Tribunal considers that to determine whether an investment
at the time it is made will contribute to economic development is rather speculative and, at most,
would be an estimated expectation. Whether such an expectation actually is realized may
eventually become known in the future and then it may be problematic to evaluate it, As regards
the criterion of good faith, in the view of the Tribunal, given in any event the requirement of
Article II(1) of the BIT that an investment be made “in accordance with [the host State’s} laws
and regulations,” an investment may qualify as such, but, if made in bad faith, may not be worthy
of protection under the BIT. The Respondent has argued that Manchester acted in bad faith as an
objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the Tribunal will examine this matter separately
below (see paragraphs 379-382 and 392-402).

PCA Case No. 2015-18

Award

In denying that the alleged investment of the Claimant qualified as a contribution, the Respondent
relies on Romak y. Uzbekistan and Postova banka v. Greece. Neither case is apposite. In
Postova banka, the dispute concerned sovereign debt. The term “bonds” in the relevant bilateral
investment treaty was only mentioned in the context of debt instruments issued by commercial
companies and not by States, A key element in the reasoning of the Postovd banka tribunal was
that the claim to money in the case of sovereign debt bought in the secondary market did not arise
under a direct contractual relationship with the issuer of the bonds. Romak concemed a straight
sale contract for milling wheat. That tribunal stated that it interpreted the term “contribution” in
broad terms as “[a]ny dedication of resources that has economic value ...”*** The tribunal found
that “Romak’s delivery of wheat was a transfer of title in performance of a sale of goods contract.
Romak did not deliver the wheat as a contribution in kind in furtherance of a venture.
Accordingly, the Arbitral Tribunal does not consider that Romak made e contribution in relation

to the transaction in question."

In the instant case, the Claimant and Qi haa a direct contractual relationship in the form of
the Bond Purchase Agreement, and the Bonds secured by the Mortgages were held by the
Claimant. The purchase of the Bonds was not an isolated transaction: it created a relationship
with the seller which established mortgages to secure the loan made by the Claimant and
evidenced by the Bonds. Furthermore, Manchester had the right to appoint two members to
RD supervisory board.’ There is no doubt that a bond is a claim to money, which in this
case was associated with the real estate development activities of the seller. An investment may
be financed by debt or equity, and either way, the investor, in the words of Romak, makes a
contribution in “furtherance of a venture.”**” In view of these considerations, the Tribunal finds

that the Claimant's investment meets the contribution criterion.

The Respondent has also argued that the Claimant did not incur an operational risk as distinct
from sovereign or commercial risk.*** The Romak and Postovd banka awards relied on by the
Respondent define risk in the context of the factual situation in their respective cases. The
Respondent recalls that the Postova banka tribunal pointed out that commercial risk is distinct

from investment risk and that the distinction “would be between a risk inherent in the investment

operation in its surrounding — meaning that the profits are not ascertained but depend on the
success or failure of the economic venture concerned — and all the other commercial and
sovereign risks.”“*° The view of the Respondent on the nature of the risk is colored by its concept
of investment, which seems to be restricted to investments in equity and dismisses the Claimant’s
investment as a “financial transaction.” The Romak award considers risk in “a situation in which

the investor cannot be sure of a return on his investment.”*°°

375. The nature of the risk will depend on the type of investment. Tribunals have considered a variety
of risks, from the existence of the dispute itself to risks inherent in long-term contracts or in the
economic or political situation in the host State. In the instant case, the return to the Claimant
was dependent on the success or failure of the economic venture. While the amount of a Joan and
the interest rate may be known from the start, there is no certainty of the success of the investment
to which the financial operation has contributed and on which payment of the interest and the
amortization of the loan depend. The dispute before the Tribunal attests to the risks of

Manchester's investment.

376. The Respondent also contends that the Mortgages do not qualify as an investment, According to
the Respondent, not all mortgages would qualify as investments and, in the instant case, the
Mortgages were established as part of the commercial activity of the Claimant.*”' The Tribunal
has determined that the activity of the Claimant qualified as an investment and, therefore, the
Mortgages, to the extent that they made possible the Bonds’ purchase, should be considered to
be part of the investment. They carry risks regarding thcir enforcement as shown by the dispute

before this Tribunal. The investment has to be considered in its totality.°”

377. As regards the criterion of duration, there is no set number of years below which an investment
would not qualify as such.*** Whether the duration criterion is satisfied will depend on the nature
and surrounding circumstances of the operation concerned. Tribunals have interpreted this

characteristic flexibly and regarded a period of two to five years as sufficient.°™ In the case of

Manchester, the Bonds had a duration of two years. The Tribunal does not consider the effect
that a default may have on the duration of an investment to be relevant for purposes of
whether a ion is an i . In the ci of this case, the Tribunal

considers that the duration criterion is satisfied.

The Tribunal concludes that the claim to money represented by the Bonds and the associated
Mortgages constitute an investment even if judged under the Salini criteria.

2, Was the investment made in bad faith?

The Respondent has argued as a jurisdictional matter that the Claimant cannot rely on the BIT’s
protection because the Mortgages were established or enforced in bad faith. The Claimant
contends that the Respondent cannot rely on bad faith as a jurisdictional defense and denies that
it acted in bad faith when establishing or enforcing the Mortgages. The Claimant has pointed out
that the objection of bad faith has been raised only in respect of the establishment and
enforcement of the Mortgages and not in respect of the Bond Purchase Agreement.

Tribunals are divided on whether bad faith should be considered as part of the jurisdiction or the

merits. The tribunal in Abaclat v. Argentina summarized this divergence:

With regard to breaches of material good faith, different tribunals have followed two different
approaches. Either they have dealt with the question of material good faith within the context of
the examination of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction or within the context of the examination of the
legality of the investment: (i) It can be seen as an issue of consent and thus of jurisdiction, where
the consent of the Host State cannot be considered to extend to investments done under
circumstances breaching the principle of good faith; (ii) It can be seen as an issue relating to the
merits, where the key question is whether the circumstances in which the relevant investment
was made are meant to be protected by the relevant BIT.°%

The Abaclat tribunal concluded:

‘There are certainly good reasons in support for each of these approaches, and the choice of the
appropriate approach will eventually depend on the circumstances of the case at stake.5%

In Procedural Order No, 2, the Tribunal joined to the merits the objections to its jurisdiction.
Hence, it has the benefit of the full factual record and, on this basis, it will decide the
Respondent's objection as part of its consideration of the merits (see paragraphs 392-402 below).

3. To what extent can the Tribunal review decisions of domestic courts?

The Respondent has argued that the claim of the Claimant is “outside the jurisdiction of this

‘Tribunal because the Claimant is requesting a substantial review of the Polish court decisions and

a determination of whether these decisions were issued in accordance with Polish law.”*°’ The
Respondent argues that this request would place the Tribunal in the role of an appellate tribunal,
which is contrary to international law and not covered by the consent of the Respondent under
Article IX of the BIT.* The Respondent has further argued that, if the Tribunal decides that it
may review the decisions of the local courts, “this review is not encompassed by any BIT
standard, particularly the fair and equitable treatment standard.”*°° On the other hand, the
Claimant replied that its claim does not call into question the Tribunal’s jurisdiction because it

requests the Tribunal to assess the decisions of the Polish courts in light of international law.°?

384, The parties to the BIT did not exclude any organ of the State from the obligations undertaken
under the BIT. The courts may breach the parties’ obligations, as may any other organ of the
State, although the content of the standard when applied to the judicial system has to be clearly
ascertained. In the Tribunal’s view, this is not a matter of jurisdiction but of the standard of
review under international law of the decisions of domestic courts and other organs of the
administration of justice. It will be best addressed as part of the Tribunal’s consideration of the

merits (see paragraphs 404-424 below).

1. What acts can be attributed to a State?

385. The Parties differ on whether the acts of the Bankruptcy Trustee or the Bankruptey Court may
be attributed to the Respondent. The Claimant has based its arguments on Article 4° and
Article 8% of the ILC Articles and on Article 115° of the Polish Criminal Code, which

specifically lists a bankruptcy trustee as a State official.

PCA Case No. 2015-18

The Respondent disputes the relevance of Article 115 because

[the] Criminal Code establishes a very specific legal regime aimed at combating criminal
activity and for this reason uses its own definitions tailor-written to serve its purposes. For
example, under the Criminal Code a teacher or a doctor are considered public officials. This
demonstrates that definitions contained in the Criminal Code depart from the general
understanding of terms and are usually much wider.
In further support, the Respondent refers to a judgment of the (ED court of Appeal that
decided:

A bankruptcy trustee is not a state body, for whose actions or inactions the State Treasury would

be liable. The bankruptcy trustee performs actions on their own [on the banknuptcy trustec’s

own] name, but on the account of the insolvent party, and it is the bankruptcy trustee who is

liable for a loss incurred through their own fault (Article 415 of the Polish Civil Code) as a

consequence of improper performance of their obligations.®>
The Respondent has also contested the attribution of the acts of the Bankruptcy Trustee to the
Respondent under Article 8 of the ILC Articles. The Respondent contends that the Claimant had
not proven that the Bankruptcy Trustee was acting under the direction, instruction or control of

the Respondent.

According to the Bankruptcy and Recovery Law, the Judge-Commissioner manages the
bankruptcy proceedings and monitors the actions of the Bankruptcy Trustee. The Judge-
Commissioner specifies what action the Bankruptcy Trustee may not take without the Judge-
Commissioner's approval.“’ The Bankruptcy Trustee submits reports to the Judge-
Commissioner on the actions taken with a statement of reasons and the Judge-Commissioner
admonishes the Bankruptcy Trustee if the Trustee neglects her duties. The Judge-
Commissioner may fine the Bankruptcy Trustee if she does not correct the negligence.°!° While
there may be some doubt as to whether under Polish law a Bankruptcy Trustee is a public official
whose actions are attributable to the State, it is clear that the Bankruptcy Trustee acted under the
general supervision and control of the Judge-Commissioner. Therefore, the next question for the

Tribunal is whether the actions of the Judge-Commissioner may be attributed to the Respondent.

The Respondent has argued that the acts of the Judge-Commissioner in the instant case were not

judicial acts because the judge acted in lieu of the creditors’ committee, which had not been

established.°!' However, the excerpts of the Bankruptcy and Recovery Law in the record of this

proceeding do not show that the monitoring and supervision function is limited to cases in which

a committee of creditors has not been established. These excerpts also show that the Judge-

Commissioner determines which acts of the Bankruptcy Trustee require her approval or the

consent of the council of creditors. Even if a creditors’ committee had been established in the

instant case, the Judge-Commissioner would have been required to approve the transfer of the
apartments. In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent explains that

when referring to the “bankruptcy court”, the Parties in fact meant two bodies involved in

conducting bankruptcy proceedings: the bankruptcy court and the judge-commissioner.
Therefore, it should be clarified that — based on the facts presented in this arbitration —

 

(a) the bankruptcy court declared QED bankrupt, while
(b) the judge-commissioner approved the transfer of the Apartments to the Prospective
Buyers by the bankruptcy trustee.°!
Whether or not the acts of the Bankruptcy Trustee can be attributed to the Respondent depends
‘on the question whether the specific acts complained of were performed under the direction of

the Judge-Commissioner, which inquiry is not necessary here.

It is indeed not disputed that acts of the courts may be attributed to the Respondent. In view of
the findings by the Tribunal later in this Award, the differences between the Parties on auribution
to the Respondent of acts of the Bankruptcy Trustee or the Judge-Commissioner are not material

to the Tribunal’s conclusions (see, in particular, paragraph 500 below).

2. Was the investment made in bad faith?

The Respondent bases its objection on the following facts:

i) the Prospective Buyers had paid the full or a substantial portion of the purchase price for the
ane... partments, (ii had agreed to transfer to the Prospective
Buyers the ownership rights to these Apartments without any encumbrances, and
iii) enfyrcement of the Mortgages would deprive the Prospective Buyers of any rights to the
am... apartments

According to the Respondent, the Claimant knowingly accepted that the Mortgages would harm
the Prospective Buyers and intentionally breached the principle of good faith, which is part of
PSC under Polish law.*!* The Respondent explains that the Polish courts decided that the

GERD Mortgage was contrary to these principles and applied these principles to prevent the
Claimant from profiting from its own wrongdoing.*'*

The jurisprudence adduced by the Respondent shows that bad faith requires “abuse of the system
of international investment protection,”® “a contract obtained by wrongful means,” a

i to fraud”®* or iption, fraud or deceitful conduct.”*!9
According to the by ishing the as collateral for the Bonds, the
Claimant “knowingly accepted that this would harm the Prospective Buyers.”*” Thus, the
“Claimant in order to secure itself a nice return on EB onds breached intentionally the

good faith principle.”*!

The GEE court of Appeal has explained PSC “by reference to the comprehensible semantic
content of such concepts as ‘principles of equity’, ‘principles of fair trade’, ‘principles of
honesty’, ‘loyalty’, or simply put — ‘Christian values’ — which are shared by the decisive majority
of society as the dictates of behavior towards other members of society.”*? These principles are
more far reaching in scope than the principle of good faith and some affirmations of the
Respondent based on these principles belong to the realm of ethics, The Tribunal is noi an ethics
tribunal and will limit itself to adjudicate on the basis of international law. While the Parties may
disagree on the content of the PSC and their applicability, they do not contest the content of the
principle of good faith as expressed by arbitral tribunals and relied on by the Respondent. The
Tribunal will be guided by how the principle of good faith has been understood and applied under
intemational law.

Before proceeding further, the Tribunal refers to the Respondent’s preliminary remarks about
GED ::2t<2y. Bis not a party to these proceedings and the cases referred to by the

It is also useful to refer to the context in which the Claimant made the investment. The

Respondent has described the situation in its Statement of Defense as follows:

   

In oe to buy before house prices rose and to meet their own housing needs, clients of
de a uently decided to buy apartments even before construction started.

The Respondent has also described as a common practice for developers to prohibit their clients
from registering in the LMR their right for ownership of the apartments to be transferred because

they wanted to keep the real estate free of any encumbrances. °°

As noted earlier in this Award, the Preliminary Agreements concluded by GD with the
Prospective Buyers and theMorgage, which pre-date the investment of the Claimant, have
the features described by the Respondent in this arbitration. It is not disputed that the Claimant
did not create the system or tailor the Prospective Buyers’ Preliminary Agreements to its
investment. The Tribunal understands the risk that Prospective Buyers incurred, but it is clear
from the record that this was standard practice, which raises the question of what is different in
the Claimant's relationship with ED ha made its Mortgages reprehensible and contrary to

The conduct of the Claimant was found by the Regional Court to be reprehensible and contrary

banks required such clauses to grant loans."*” That it was common practice is also proven by the
need io pass legislation such as the Apartment Buyer Protection Act in order to protect
prospective apartment buyers. In defense of the Claimant’s claim of discrimination, the
Respondent itself has argued that the new legislation was meant to address a generic situation

and that it did not target the Claimant.”*°

The Tribunal is mindful that the Supreme Court disagreed with the Court of Appeal in the case
of the QED Morigage and the Tribunal will return to this matter when considering the
claim of breach of FET. For purposes of determining whether the Claimant acted in bad faith
under international! law, the Tribunal observes that the Claimant had no part in devising the
Preliminary A that the d firmed in the S| of Defense that the
practices followed by the Claimant were standard practices in the Polish real estate market, and
that no misrepresentation, bribery, fraud or abuse of process has been alleged against the
Claimant. These considerations lead the Tribunal to conclude that in making the investment, in

securing it and in seeking to enforce the Mortgages, the Claimant did not act in bad faith.

The Tribunal will now consider first the relationship of denial of justice to the BIT standards and

then proceed to examine the claims for breach of the BIT.

3. What is the relationship of denial of justice to the BIT standards?

Under the FET standard in the BIT, Manchester has claimed, inter alia, denial of justice, and,
alternatively. it has claimed the same under customary international law.‘*! The Respondent has
argued that this claim is “outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal because the Claimant is
requesting a substantial review of the Polish court decisions and a determination of whether these
decisions were issued in accordance with Polish law.”? The Respondent considers that this
request is contrary to international law and that it is not covered by the consent of the Respondent
under Article IX of the BIT.° The Respondent has further argued that, if the Tribunal decides
that it may review the decisions of the local courts, “absent a denial of justice, this review is not

encompassed by any BIT standard, particularly the fair and equitable treatment standard.”***

The Tribunal observes that “denial of justice” is not included expressis verbis in any provision
of the BIT and that none of the provisions in Article II of the BIT on “Treatment of Investment”
exclude courts from their application, Article 11(6) requires that “[i]nvestment shall at all times
be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no
case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.” This text does not
exclude any branch of the Government and establishes the gauge against which to measure the

treatment to be accorded.

The Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent’s affirmation that the review of domestic courts”
decisions is not encompassed by any BIT standards. The Tribunal observes that other obligations
respecting the treatment of investments under Article II of the BIT, such as protection of
investments against discrimination or arbitrary measures, are part of FET and may rise toa denial
of justice. Moreover, by including the phrase “shall in no case be accorded treatment less than
that required by international law” in Article 11(6), the BIT incorporates customary intemational

law, necessarily including “denial of justice.”

In any event, arbitral tribunals consistently have found that FET encompasses denial of justice.

For those tribunals, denial of justice is a part of the FET applicable to a State’s courts, based on

different specific criteria, when applied to courts. This has been clearly articulated in many
investment awards, for example in Swiss/ion v. Macedonia:

justice and to respect the ipaneiple of due process. Bat even in cases in which there is no Snes

Similarly, the tribunal in Jan de Nui y, Egypt stated:

regarding the miscarriage or denial of justice. It considers, One, that the fair at wilable

The same approach was adopted in Oostergetel v. The Slovak Republic:

Although the BIT does not specifically refer to the concept of denial of justice, the Tribunal, in

line with other tribunals and established doctrine, considers it to be comprised in the FET

standard,”
The question for the Tribunal is whether it may find a breach of FET by the courts short of a
finding of denial of justice. Expressed differently, is the threshold for finding a breach of FET by
the courts different from the threshold applicable in the case of denial of justice?

At the request of the Tribunal, the Parties discussed in their Post-Hearing Briefs the question of
whether, absent denial of justice, the Tribunal may review decisions of Polish courts for breach
of international law on grounds of discrimination, unfair and inequitable treatment, national
treatment or judicial expropriation, The Parties further developed their arguments on this issue
and the Tribunal finds their discussion of the practice of arbitral tribunals instructive.

Both Parties refer to the Arif'v. Moldova case, The Claimant draws the attention of the Tribunal
to the distinction drawn by the Arif tribunal between denial of justice and FET.°* That tribunal

stated that, notwithstanding the overlap between the two,

the terms to describe one or the other sphere of international rights and obligations Genial of

confusion. It does not imply, however, that both standards and principles have merged into
one and that the prerequisites as well as the consequences of a claim for denial of justice and
for the violation of a treaty standard of fair and equitable treatment have become identical.°*

The Respondent has emphasized that, when assessing whether the investor was accorded fair and
equitable treatment, the Avi tribunal applied the test as if it were assessing the facts for a claim
of denial of justice. Thus, the tribunal held that “the State can be held responsible for an unfair
and inequitable treatment of a foreign indirect investor if and when the judiciary breached the
standard by fundamentally unfair proceedings and outrageously wrong, final and binding

decisions.”

To fully understand the holding of the Arif tribunal, it is useful to consider its factual context.
The Arif tribunal dismissed Mr. Arif’s claim of denial of justice because the claimant was an

indirect investor through ownership of shares in a local company. The tribunal reasoned:

Conversely to a free-standing claim for denial of justice which can only be brought by a person
that has participated in the national court proceedings, the standard of fair and equitable
treatment also protects the foreign sharcholder in a local company. If the standard is

by a denial of justice, the State will be held responsible towards the indirect investor fora breach
of fair and equitable treatment.

 

The Arif tribunal considered two sets of court actions under the heading of “Denial of Justice
under the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard.” A fter reviewing the first set of court decisions,
the tribunal concluded: “[These arguments] do not disqualify, however, the national courts’
application to such a degree to be so egregiously wrong that no competent and honest court would
use them.” In reviewing the second set, it recalled that its “role is limited to determine whether
the judiciary has denied justice by applying that are so void of reason that they breathe
bad faith.”* Expressions such as “egregiously wrong” or “devoid of reason” used by the Arif
tribunal indicate a threshold reminiscent of denial of justice as understood under customary
international law.“ The tribunal dismissed the claim of denial of justice and upheld the claim of

breach of FET for reasons unrelated to the courts’ actions.

Both Parties have also discussed the Tamefi v. Ukraine award. According to the Claimant, that
tribunal accorded more limited deference to domestic courts and upheld the claim of FET even
if it did not amount to denial of justice.“ On the other hand, the Respondent argues that this case

supports its argument that misapplication of the domestic law does not constitute a breach of the

BIT.™® As regards deference to the domestic courts in the context of FET, the Tameff tribunal

held that:

Deference is further limited by a variety of considerations arising from equitableness and
reasonableness. In this sense a decision can be inequitable and unreasonable without rising to
levels as dramatically wrong as those just mentioned [high standards of egregiousness,
manifest injustice, lack of due process, offending judicial propriety, arbitrariness, bad faith
and clear and malicious application of the law] and still eventually engage liability for the
breach of the FET standard.”

The Tamefi tribunal concluded that:

[T]here are no sufficient reasons to justify a finding of denial of justice. However, it is quite

evident that the fair and equitable treatment standard has been compromised by a number of

court actions. In this respect such standard has a broader meaning than the strict denial of justice

as understood under traditional customary international law.°*
On the other hand, the Respondent notes that while “the [Tatneft] tribunal held that judicial
conduct which is arbitrary and unreasonable can breach the FET standard even if it does not
amount to a denial of justice,” in the next sentence the tribunal concluded that “the mere
misapplication of domestic law is not enough to give rise to liability absent some kind of adverse

intention"?

The Parties have also discussed other cases that illustrate the various approaches taken by arbitral
tribunals in respect of FET and other commitments of States under the BIT and their relationship
to denial of justice. The Respondent has referred to Saipem v. Bangladesh and Liman Caspian
Oil v. Kazakhstan in support of the argument that the test of denial of justice is also applied in
assessing whether decisions of the courts are expropriatory.°° Thus, in the case of Liman Caspian
Oil, the tribunal found that “the Kazakh court decisions were not arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust,
idiosyncratic, discriminatory or lacking due process, even if they might have been incorrect as a
matter of Kazakh law, and that correspondingly they have to be accepted from the perspective of
international law and particularly that of the ECT.”*! Similarly, the decision that the Bangladeshi
courts expropriated Saipem was based on a finding by the tribunal that those courts abused their
supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration process.°*? However, the Tribunal observes that it is

relevant to the present discussion that the Saipem tribunal’s jurisdiction was limited to

expropriation claims and that the tribunal differentiated a claim of expropriation by the courts
from a claim of denial of justice: “While the Tribunal concurs with the parties that expropriation
by the courts presupposes that the courts’ intervention was illegal, this does not mean that

expropriation by a court necessarily presupposes a denial of justice.”°**

The Claimant has also discussed the cases of Deutsche Bank vy. Sri Lanka, ATA v. Jordan, Saipem,
Chevron v. Ecuador, Sistem Miihendislik v. The Kyrgyz Republic and White Industries v, India
in support of its argument that breach of the BIT by actions of the courts may occur short of
denial of justice.° The Claimant relies on the Deutsche Bank case to show that the tribunal found
an order of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka lacking in due process and in breach of FET despite
the fact that denial of justice had not been pleaded.‘** The Tribunal observes that the interim
order of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka was granted based on “extremely limited evidence and
without a hearing from the various banks whose contractual rights were directly affected ...”°*°
The Deutsche Bank tribunal also relied on public statements of the Sri Lankan Chief Justice, who
confirmed that the order was issued for political reasons.°** While the tribunal found a breach of
the respondent’s fair and equitable treatment obligation in the form of a due process violation
without qualifying it as egregious, the facts relicd on by the tribunal speak for themselves:
“extremely limited evidence”, no hearing for those affected and political motivation.

In the ATA case, the tribunal rejected the claim of denial of justice for lack of jurisdiction ratione

temporis.°** Notwithstanding the lack of jurisdiction, the tribunal observed:
From the outset, the parties focussed on the conduct of the Jordanian courts in adjudicating the
grounds for annulment of the Final Award. Their actions could hardly be said to have constituted
abusive misconduct, bad faith or a denial of justice. Notwithstanding its finding of a lack of
jurisdiction, the Tribunal would note that it was unconvinced that, even if there had been
jurisdiction, a claim of denial of justice, whether substantive or procedural, could have been
sustained.

Although the claim of denial of justice could not be sustained, the ATA tribunal found the court

of cassation’s retroactive application of a new arbitration law to be contrary to the obligations of

the respondent under the relevant bilateral investment treaty. The tribunal did not specify which

of those obligations had been breached, but it found it necessary to clarify that the action by the

court of cassation was in breach of the treaty even if a denial of justice could not be sustained.

As we have already noted above, the Saipem tribunal had no jurisdiction other than for
expropriation claims and clarified that denial of justice is not a pre-condition for a finding of
expropriation by decisions of courts. The Sistem Miihendislik tribunal found expropriation of the
claimant’s interest in a hotel by the courts without any discussion of denial of justice.' Similarly,
the tribunals in Chevron and White Industries found that the effective means obligation under a
BIT may be breached by failures of domestic courts even if such failures may not be sufficient

to find a denial of justice.

‘The practice of the tribunals having made a reference to FET is varied. It shows that tribunals
have been open to find a breach of obligations under bilateral investment treaties by domestic
courts without a finding of denial of justice, but, at the same time, that they have recognized that
a high threshold should be applied to the FET standard. The variations in the practice of tribunals
merit the following observations: first, irrespective of the position taken by a tribunal on this
question, a high threshold is applied to determine a breach of FET by domestic courts. Second,
the evaluation of the threshold is factually driven and the egregiousness of the facts may be more
indicative of the threshold applied than the adjectives used by a tribunal to describe the threshold,
if described at all. As stated by the Sa/uka v. Czech Republic tribunal, “|t}o the extent that the
case law reveals different formulations of the relevant thresholds, an in-depth analysis may well
demonstrate that they could be explained by the contextual and factual differences of the cases
to which the standards have been applied.”®* Third, what was not egregious in the context of
criminal proceedings in Mexico in the early decades of the twentieth century may qualify as

egregious by today’s standards.

The Claimant has pleaded breach of the FET standard on the basis of arbitrary and discriminatory

treatment, inconsistent conduct, failure to maintain a stable legal framework, frustration of the

Claimant's legitimate expectations and denial of justice. As grounds for denial of justice, the

Claimant has adduced the arbitrary nature of the Supreme Court rulings, discriminatory
including the discriminatory application of PSC, and i by the

in the judicial proceedings. The Tribunal will consider each of these grounds in order to verify

whether a denial of justice has occurred. Arbitrary and discriminatory treatment by courts, and

interference by the Respondent in judicial proceedings, are directly related to the claim of denial
of justice. The claim of inconsistent conduct bears a relationship with the claim of discriminatory
treatment of the investment by the Polish courts. Had the claim of denial of justice been found to
be baseless by applying the threshold of egregiousness inherent to such claim, the Tribunal would
have had to address the issue of whether a lesser threshold may be applied in considering conduct
of domestic courts under the FET standard. However, considering the conclusion reached by the
Tribunal on the existence of a denial of justice (see paragraphs 497-499 below). there is no need

for it to take a position on this issue.
4. The FET standard

(a) What is the scope of the FET standard?

In order to assess the different elements of FET under the prism of denial of justice, the scope of
the standard needs to be ascertained. The Tribunal first notes that, in its Statement of Claim, the
Claimant alleged that the Respondent breached a number of obligations encompassed by the FET
standard, In its Statement of Defense, the Respondent did not contest that these obligations were
part of the FET standard; it only disputed the allegation that it had breached them. In the Reply,
the Claimant recalled the elements of the FET standard encompassed by Article II(6) of the BIT
and noted that they had not been disputed by the Respondent in the Statement of Defense.
However, in the Rejoinder, the Respondent disagreed on certain elements of the FET standard
alleged by the Claimant, in particular, inconsistent State conduct, the obligation to maintain a
stable legal and business and the pi ion of investors’ legiti i The
Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to produce evidence of State practice or opinio
juris to confirm that intemational Jaw recognizes all of the components of the FET standard
argued by the Claimant.*** The next opportunity for the Claimant to address this issue was in its
opening argument at the hearing. The Claimant stated:
As you know very well [the FET standard] is not defined in the Treaty ... it has been the subject
of many awards and commentaries. With respect, we find the list in Professor Dolzer and
Schreuer’s book to be a helpful starting point, and I'm sure you know from other cases and
submissions that those commentators refer to the principles that are encompassed in the FET,
stability and protection of the investor's legitimate expectations, transparency, compliance with
contractual obligations, procedural propriety, good faith as included in this concept. Also,
awards — some of your own — refer to the prohibition of discrimination or arbitrary treatment,

inconsistent State conduct, and the obligation to maintain a stable legal and business framework
and denial of justice, also encompassing thc FET standard.®*

The Respondent did not address this matter further at the hearing.

426. The Claimant has argued as part of the alleged breach of the FET standard that the Respondent

failed to maintain a stable legal and business framework for the Claimant's investment, frustrated

the Claimant's legitimate expectations, acted arbitrarily, discriminated against the Claimant and

acted inconsistently, and that the Respondent’s acts amount to denial of justice. The Claimant

has also argued that the composite effect of the Respondent’s measures breached the FET
standard.®°”

427. Fair and equitable treatment may be applicable to a wide variety of situations, which may explain
the lack of a uniform and comprehensive definition under international law to which the ‘Tribunal
could tum. The Tribunal will interpret FET in accordance with its ordinary meaning, context and

purpose as required by Article 31 of the VCLT.

428, The term “fair” means “treating people equally without favoritism or discrimination”, and “just
or appropriate in the circumstances.”** “Equitable” means “fair” and “impartial.” “Just,
equitable, fair-minded, open-minded, honest, upright, honorable, trustworthy” are synonyms of
“fair”, and “fair and just” are synonyms of equitable.°” The context of the undertaking of FET is
an article that details the treatment to be accorded to foreign “investment”, starting with a general

to treat foreign ii on a non-discrimi y basis. The wider context is the
entire BIT, a treaty on “business and economic relations” of the two State parties. As set forth in

its Preamble, the parties agree that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order

 

“to maintain a stable for ij and i effective utilization of
resources.”*”' The twin purposes of fair and equitable treatment set the bar against which a State
party’s performance must be measured. As pointed out by other tribunals, FET needs to be
interpreted in a balanced manner, as has been stated forcefully, for example, by the E/ Paso
tribunal:

This Tribunal considers that a balanced interpretation is needed, taking into account both State
sovereignty and the State’s responsibility to create an adapted and evolutionary framework for
the development of economic activities, and the necessity to protect foreign investment and its
continuing flow.”

PCA Case No. 2015-18

Award

The FET standard should not be understood to be for the exclusive benefit of the investor, but it
should be recognized that it serves a wider purpose underlying the willingness of the State to
enter into the BIT. To sum up, the Tribunal understands fair and equitable treatment to mean
treatment that objectively will be considered just by an impartial observer bearing in mind the
circumstances. The standard is “a flexible one which must be adapted to the circumstances of

each case,.”*”

(b) Has the breached the FET standard by itting a denial of justice?
(i) Was the investment subject to arbitrary treatment?

In its ordinary meaning, arbitrary means “based on random choice or personal whim, rather than
any reason or system.”°* The International Court of Justice in the ELS! case defined
“arbitrariness” as “not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed to the
tule of law... It is a willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least

   

surprises, a sense of judicial propriety.”“”* The Claimant has argued that the Respondent took a
series of arbitrary actions against its investment not based on reason or fact. The Tribunal will

now consider each one of the actions in question.

The Compulsory Mortgages

In support of its claim of arbitrary treatment, the Claimant relies on the fact that Compulsory
Mortgages were granted as injunctive relief for the Prospective QED Buyers before

GED bankruptcy and that the Supreme Court upheld the injunctive relief after QD
bankruptcy.

The first part of the Claimant’s argument concerns whether the claims secured by the Compulsory
Mortgages are monetary claims. The Claimant relies on the Report of the Bankruptcy Trustee,
which describes the object of the security “to be an obligation to make a declaration of will
establishing separate ownership title to an aparmen located n@Bo

It is not disputed that the Prospective Buyers made payments lez The issue is, what
obligation did the Compulsory Mortgages secure? The Respondent has pointed out that the
Prospective Buyers sought not only a declaration of will but also compensation, and that the
Compulsory Mortgages were granted as security for these hybrid claims.*”* The Respondent has
further pointed out that the security sought in the Preliminary Agreement Enforcement
Proceedings was governed by the CCP.°” Article 755 of the CCP provides that “if the object of
security is not a monetary claim, the court will award such security as it deems fit in the
circumstances, not excluding methods provided to secure monetary claims.” Thus, it is not
excluded by the applicable provisions of Polish law that a court grants mortgages as security

beyond monetary claims.

‘The second leg of the Claimant’s argument concerns the alleged judicial activism of the Supreme
Court when it interpreted Articles 744 and 182 of the CCP. The Supreme Court decision was
prompted by the following question from thefEBCourt of Appeal: “Does the discontinuation
of proceedings pursuant to Article 182 par. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure result in the
cancellation of injunctive relief pursuant to Art. 744 of the Code of Civil Procedure?"*' The

Supreme Court decided that:

The discontinuation of the proceedings pursuant to Art. 182 par. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure

does not result in the cancellation of the injunctive relief provided for in Art. 744 of the Code of

Civil Procedure, consisting in the encumbrance of a real property with a compulsory mortgage

entered into the land and mortgage register before the declaration of bankruptcy, **
The Supreme Court noted: “When introducing the new basis for the discontinuation of the

According to the Supreme Court. the different nature of the need to discontinue the proceedings
under Article 182, paragraph 1 of the CCP does not arise from the inadmissibility of pursuing the
relevant claim, but rather from the need to introduce the appropriate method of satisfying it. Thus,
Article 182(2) of the CCP enables the claimant to pursue the claim again by way of proceedings
discontinued earlier.* According to the Supreme Court, it would be incompatible with this
provision that the discontinuation of proceedings result in the cancellation of the relief granted.
The Supreme Court also considered its interpretation of the CCP in the context of the legislation
relevant to mortgage registration and bankruptcy. The Tribunal concludes that the Supreme
Court discussed the rationale for the different provisions of the CCP and endeavored to give a
cohesive interpretation of the law. The Tribunal finds without merit the argument advanced by

the Claimant that the decision of the Supreme Court on the Compulsory Mortgages was arbitrary.
The Prosecutor’s Order

On 26 October 2009, the EB Prosecutor issued an order seizing the ED Property as
evidence in the criminal proceedings againsi QED’ The order was appealed to the QD
Regional Court by the Bankruptcy Trustee and the Claimant. The (§MBEBRegional Court

quashed the order.°**

The Parties disagree on whether the order was a Government measure or a
decision of the judiciary and on whether such an order meets the test of finality under
international law. The Tribunal is of the view that whether or not the order of the prosecutor was
a Government measure is irrelevant. The order of the Prosecutor was subject to court review and
the QB Regional Court found that it had no basis in law. The Claimant and the Bankruptcy
Trustee availed themselves successfully of the remedy provided by Polish law. The Tribunal
does not consider that international responsibility may arise from conduct of an officer of the

State which has been remedied by that State’s judiciary.

The supreme Coun Ruling

The Supreme Court invalidated the (EEE origage on the basis of PSC. The Court found
determinative the so-called negative clauses of the Preliminary Agreements (the Non-
Registration Clauses) and the awareness of such clauses by Manchester. This led the Court to

conclude:

Therefore, it should be noted that the action taken by defendant [Manchester] to secure its
interests as a new creditor of the developer was one of the planned results of the dishonest
conduct of the developer, with that defendant [Manchester] being aware of that dishonesty.°?
In the context of the exceptional nature of the application of PSC, it is disputed between the
Parties whether the principles were appropriately applied, whether the Supreme Court took into
account events subsequent to the grant of he Mortgage, and whether it failed to
explain how the taking of security by a financing party when the developer’s clients had made
their payments without any security violates PSC. As briefly expressed by the Claimant:

 

[T]he crux of this dispute is that although the Supreme Court invoked “principles of social co-
existence”, in its judgment concerning the QED Mor:za2, it did not apply generally
accepted values common to the European tradition, but parochial, idiosyncratic and own
preferences favoring local creditors and discriminating against a foreign investor.‘

The Supreme Court based its decision on four grounds:

(i) The Court considered that the clearly dishonest and risky conduct of the developer made it
necessary to carry out an appropriately thorough examination of the circumstances in which the
developer established the mortgages “from the point of view of the principles of social co-
existence, while also taking into consideration the rules of professional ethics of property

developers.”°”!

(ii) The Court objected to the Court of Appeal’s qualification as “neutral” in respect of PSC the
fact that the “US entity” would protect its claims diligently. The opinion of the Court of Appeal
ignored “the circumstances leading to precisely such special protection that clearly worsens the
situation of the developer’s original creditors...” The Supreme Court then referred to the
negative clauses designed to ensure that the developer maintained an appropriate level of

i in legal ions. The Court luded its ing on this point by stating
that:

It is clear that defendant [Manchester] was aware of those clauses during the contractual
cooperation between the two defendants that was aimed at creating a basic form of financing for
the developer, Therefore, it should be noted that the action taken by defendant [Manchester] to
secure its interests as a new creditor of the developer was one of the planned results of the
dishonest conduct of the developer, with that defendant being aware of that dishonesty.

(iii) The Court insisted on the Claimant’s awareness of the situation and had “no doubt that
creating a mortgage over the real property to which the investment related, with priority before

the initial creditors (claimants) was an element of an appropriate legal and economic calculation
by defendant [Manchester].”°"*

(iv) The Court noted that:

‘The claimants had already bome the risk of the failure of the investment (currently they are
trying only to protect their pecuniary claims, Art. 91 sec. 2 of the Bankruptcy Law). The
developer’s irresponsible and irrational economic activity that led to the creation of mortgages
for the benefit of a single, major creditor contrary to the terms of the preliminary agreements
and as a consequence permission for defendant [Manchester] to “take the initiative” with regard
to finalizing the investment project (in the form of a proposal to increase the price of flats for
the claimants) may therefore be seen as dishonest conduct that is inconsistent with the principles.
of social co-existence and professional ethics of property developers (Art. 58 § 2 of the Civil
Code).

The Tribunal is not an appellate tribunal. PSC are clearly part of Polish law and it is not the role
of this Tribunal to question the understanding of PSC by the Supreme Court, It is immaterial
whether Article 58(2) of the Civil Code was transplanted from communist law in 1964. The
Constituti Court ined the conditions for its i ion and application in 2000.°" The
Claimant has relied on the Constitutional Court judgment to argue that the Supreme Court
departed from those conditions in applying PSC in the case of the (EEE Mortgage.” The
Tribunal will not second-guess the Supreme Court’s application of Polish law.

 

A different matter is whether the Supreme Court inconsistently engaged in a determination of
facts at variance with the factual findings of the Court of Appeal! notwithstanding its limited role
as a cassation court, thus committing a denial of justice. The Claimant has argued that the
Supreme Court made factual findings that were not in the ruling of the Court of Appeal without
an evidentiary hearing, which raises an issue of due process. Specifically, the Supreme Court
found that: BBD acted dishonestly, Manchester was aware of it, GERD usiness activity
was risky, careless and irrational, and Manchester took the initiative in proposing an increase in
the price of the QD 4 partments. According to the Claimant, these findings of fact were
reached by the Supreme Court in disregard of Article 398(13) of the CCP. This article provides:

 

“New facts and evidence cannot be admitted in cassation proceedings, and the Supreme Court is
bound by the findings constituting the basis of the challenged judgment.” On the other hand,

the Respondent contends that the statements of the Supreme Court are legal assessments of facts
different from the assessment by the Court of Appeal and not actual determinations of facts.°”

For the Tribunal, the question is whether the Supreme Court in each of the instances in which it
considered the EEE Mortgage, tho Mortgage QED snc QB cases) and the
Mortgage applied the same distinction in the exercise of its function as a court of cassation
and, if it did not, whether this amounts to a denial of justice, and thus to a breach of FET. The
Tribunal observes that the Court of Appeal in its decision on the QD Mortgage held that,
to invalidate a contractual mortgage on the basis of Article 58(2) of the Civil Code, “it would be
necessary to demonstrate the factual circumstances attesting to the base behavior of or even a
conspiracy between the defendants aimed at harming the claimants. The Regional Court did not
find such conspiracy, and what is more the claimants did not point to one...”” In the QD
case, the Supreme Court dismissed the claim of invalidation of the ED Mortgage. The
Court explained that the appellant ignored the fact that she was departing from the findings by
which the Supreme Court is bound in accordance with Art. 398(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure.
This applies first and foremost to the findings as to the lack on the part CD + the
intention to cause harm to the appellant’s legal predecessor, the reasons for the company’s
bankruptcy, its lack of regular business relations with the claimant before the conclusion of the

cooperation agreement, as well as the lack of enrichment on the claimant's part.”

Nonetheless, the Supreme Court found that the (EEEMortgage was unenforceable under
Article 5 of the Civil Code.” As a practical matter, for the Claimant the distinction between
invalidity and enforceability is not significant. But for the Tribunal it is relevant that the Supreme
Court held that it could not depart from the factual findings of the lower courts. It is also
particularly relevant what the Supreme Court considered factual findings ~ inter alia, the lack of
intention (Eo cause harm and the reasons for the company’s bankruptcy.

In the QM case, the Supreme Court decided that the ¥EEED Mortgage complied with PSC
and found this mortgage valid and enforceable.” The Supreme Court based its decision on the

factual findings of the Court of Appeal.

There has been no explanation in the QB -2se as to why the Supreme Court disregarded
the facts established by the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court found the EEE ortgage

to be contrary to the Preliminary Agreements notwithstanding that these agreements did not

restrict EB ebitity to borrow funds in the future or mortgage its assets. The Supreme Court

did not rely on any clause in the Preliminary Agreements in support of this determination. The

Preliminary Agreements have equally no provision that would permit Manchester to take the

initiative and complete the project. The Supreme Court analyzed the situation after the

bankruptcy proceedings started as if Manchester had known tha (EB would eventually be
bankrupt.

It is not so much a question of whether the action taken by the Supreme Court was a legal
assessment of facts or a fact-finding exercise, or of whether in either case its decision should be
accordingly considered arbitrary. What remains wholly unexplained is why such an exercise
would be necessary in the case of the QD Mortgage. but not in the case of ne
Mortgage GB: GB cases) or thefiMortgage. Such a different approach concerming
Polish nationals or foreign entities is arbitrary, as it has no rational justification. The Tribunal
will return to this question in considering the claim of discrimination (see paragraphs 448-468
below).

The Ownership Transfer
On 29 April 2014, the Judge-Commissioner, in a two-paragraph decision without any reasoning,
allowed the Bankruptcy Trustee “to perform the mutual agreements concluded by the bankrupt
with individual or organizational units ... and commercial premises situated in buildings QD
GS FR ree as well as in the building at GB rec: =
(preliminary agreements)."™* A month earlier, the QQMBBBRegional Court had dismissed a
lawsuit of the Prospective Buyers against the Bankruptcy Trustee. The Prospective Buyers had

that the api be to them. According to the EBB egional Court,

only pecuniary claims could be satisfied in bankruptcy, but the Court, in an obiter dictum, seemed

 

to have favored the decision approving the transfer.” By then, the Supreme Court bad
invalidated the QD Mortgage.

Of the various grounds argued by the Claimant in support of its claim of arbitrary treatment of
its investment, the Tribunal finds surprising that the title transfer, without a modicum of reasoning
by the Bankruptcy Trustee, would be approved by the Judge-Commissioner. More significantly,
the Tribunal finds it difficult to understand the fact-finding in which the Supreme Court engaged,
which apparently depended on the nature of the creditor or who was the holder of a mortgage.

The Tribunal will return to this question in considering the next item.

(ii) Was the investment subject to discrimination?

Manchester’s claim of discrimination is based on the different treatment of the Be and
GRR orrgages by the Supreme Court and the different treatment of unsecured creditors
in the case of bankruptcy proceedings of other real estate developers.

The Parties agree on the test to determine whether Poland discriminated against the Claimant:

different treatment of entities in like situations without reasonable justification.”

The Claimant has argued that the Respondent discriminated against Manchester’s investment
because Manchester was a foreign investor. The Respondent contends that the difference of
treatment can be explained by the fact that the Claimant acted in bad faith in the case of the
GER origace and that only the Prospective QED Buyers sought invalidation of
their mortgages, while the clients of other real estate developers did not. The Respondent points
out that other lenders to real estate developers such as ED: GED «ere also
foreign owned at the time of the bankruptcy of their borrowers and, therefore, their case does not

support the Claimant's discrimination claim.”

The Tribunal has already determined that the Claimant did not act in bad faith. Even the Supreme
Court was not consistent in finding that the Claimant acted in bad faith. Bad faith is not
determinative for the Tribunal to distinguish the treatment of Manchester’s investment from
treatment of other lenders to other real estate developers. On the other hand, the Tribunal finds it
to be a determinative distinguishing factor that the clients of other real estate developers in

financial difficulty did not seek in the courts the invalidation of the mortgages held by lenders.

After these observations, the Tribunal’s analysis of the claim of discrimination will be mainly
concemed with the treatment of the QED Morigage as compared with the treatment
accorded to ne Mortgage. The analysis will be complemented by that of the @na
cases under the Claimant’s allegation of inconsistent conduct.

There is no dispute between the Parties that the EEEEEMortgage and the {@iMorigage
were treated differently. The issue is whether the Claimant and. ere in like situations, The
Claimant asserts that Manchester and QB vere in like circumstances because both lent funds to

of the unsecured claims of the Prospective Buyers and of the contents of the Preliminary

Agreements, particularly the Non-Registration Clauses.”

454. On the other hand, the Respondent contests that Manchester and were in like circumstances
because: (i) the financing they provided served different purposes; (ii) the Prospective Buyers
were aware of the (Mortgage, but not of GERD vention to enter into the secured
transaction with Manchester; (iii) the financing of GD was in the interest of the Prospective
Buyers, while Manchester’s financing was contrary to their interest; (iv) the terms of release were
different; (v) the approaches of the two lenders to the Non-Registration Clauses were different;

and (vi) the parties seeking invalidation of the mortgages were different.”"°

455. The Court of Appeal in thef{iiicase found that there were distinguishing factors between the

GMortgaze and the Mortgage, and the Supreme Court decided on the basis of
those findings.”"'

456, The argument of the different purpose of the mortgages is based on the premise that the funds
lent by GB were for the purchase of the GP roperty, while the funds lent by the
Claimant were used for purposes broader that the QED roperty. In the case of the Bond
Purchase Agreement, the funds of each Bond issue were earmarked for a specific purpose and an
issue of up to PLNGHED «as for the current business activity oD: is correct that
none of the funds were destined specifically to the financing of the QED Property.
However, the Tribunal questions whether this is a distinguishing factor between the two
mortgages because the @Morigage was itself secured by other properties unrelated to the
purchase of the ED? ropeny and not all the funds borrowed from {vere intended for
the purchase of the QD soperty.”” Moreover, the monies paid by the Prospective

GERD Buyers were not necessarily used for construction of the (ED Property and

the Prospective Buyers were granted Compulsory Mortgages irrespective of whether their

payments had been dedicated to financing the construction of the apartments or shops in the

separate account for the implementation of that specific project.”!*

The Tribunal is not persuaded that the purposes of the QED 1d (I Morigages were

borrower who proved to be financially insolvent when the financial crisis struck. Whether the

lending by the Prospective Buyers. The issue is the extent to which the Prospective Buyers were

and that neither lender had a direct relationship with the Prospective Buyers. It is also of
significance that the content of the Preliminary Agreements was not devised by Manchester. It is
equally relevant that the Preliminary Agreements did not limit the ability of EE} to borrow

Sa ee Morteace. the Tribunal concludes that awareness of the

Mortgages is not a justification for different treatment.

Third, the Respondent contends that the IP Mortgage was in the interests of the Prospective
Buyers while the QD Mortgage was to their prejudice. The Respondent presumes that,
“(i]t the i redit facility had not been granted, (EEED would probably not have purchased
the land and so would not have been able to carry out the construction or perform the
Preliminary Agreements ...””!? Furthermore, the Respondent contends that it cannot be said that

establishing a mortgage on a property to finance another is not a significant factor in this case,
Whether Manchester and QB passed on the credit risk to the Prospective Buyers is the

subject of the next items.

The terms of relief are the fourth distinguishing factor argued by the Respondent, The key
evidence is that, in the case of thei Mortgage, in October 2006, after the signing of the

Prospective Buyers had paid the full price.” However, QB did not honor the promise and
refused to release the Mortgage when (BB defaulted and was declared bankrupt.” The
Tribunal is unconvinced that the unfulfilled promise of Gis a differentiating factor.

Registration Clauses. Ct

Mr QED testified tha he was informed by sta 1

CD 1:90 sence betore

the Tribunal to show that the two lenders had a different approach in respect of these clauses. If
they had, it would have been incorporated in their lending instruments with QED and it was

not.

The Claimant has argued that the Respondent has implied a sixth ground for distinguishing
between the 1c GED Mortgages, namely, that the Prospective Buyers’ claim was
grounded in the constitutional protection of the housing needs of Polish citizens. In contrast,
Manchester's claim to invalidate the GB Mortgage lacked such basis for two reasons: the
identity of the claimant — the Prospective Buyers or Manchester — secking invalidation, and the

timing of the Preliminary A and of the i of Mi in relation to when

the mortgages were established.”

The Tribunal has difficulty understanding how the housing needs protected by the Polish
Constitution can be a differentiating factor since, just as in the case of the invalidation of the
GRD Mortzace, the invalidation of the Mortgage would have been in the interest of

the Prospective Buyers.

In sum, the Tribunal remains unconvinced by the reasons advanced by the Respondent to
differentiate between the and GED Mortgages and thereby justify the different
treatment of @Mind Manchester. By the same token, the Tribunal is unconvinced by the
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case, endorsing the analysis of the Court of Appeal,
to the effect that there were differentiating factors explaining why the WEED Mortgage was
considered by the Supreme Court in the light of PSC, while the Qi) Mortgage was not so

 

considered. ””*

The lack of justification becomes more evident when the reasons argued by the Respondent in
these proceedings are compared with the reasoning of the Supreme Court in the (ED case,

where it accepted the facts established by the Court of Appeal:

‘The aim of the said acts [the establishment of the mortgage] in law was not to cause harm to her
legal predecessor; a ses the funds obtained from the issue of the bonds for
further investments; that it was not declared bankrupt until two and a helf years after the

errors in the of market and its own i ilities and
resources.”
468. The Tribunal concludes that the Respondent failed to accord the Claimant the treatment thai iD
was accorded, The Tribunal will continue to address the differences in treatment under the

allegation of inconsistent conduct before reaching an overall conclusion.

(iii) Did the Respondent adopt inconsistent conduct?

469. The claim of inconsistency is based on the invalidation of the (EEE Mortgage afier it had
been confirmed by the Registry Court and the different treatment of Manchester's QD

and QD Mortgages.

470. On the first point, the Claimant has argued that registration of a mortgage in the LMR is
constitutive and that the registration of the mortgages gave nse to a reasonable expectation that
they were valid and enforceable.”° The Claimant does not contest that registered mortgages may
be invalidated, but contends that the courts may invalidate registered mortgages only on the basis
of information not known to the Registry Court at the time of registration, ”°

47). The Respondent explains that the Registry Court does not have the power to conduct evidentiary

proceedings to determine whether mortgages comply with PSC.”””

According to the Respondent,
the Registry Court registers a mortgage based only on a review of the application for registration,
the documents attached to the application and the content of the LMR. The Respondent further
explains that the general information on the Preliminary Agreements did not show whether the
Preliminary Agreements were entered into by natural persons or entrepreneurs, whether the
Prospective Buyers could or could not register their rights under the Preliminary Agreements, or
whether the Prospective Buyers had been informed tha PPP intended to establish mortgages

on the property.”**

472. The Tribunal is not convinced by the argument that the Respondent acted incoherently by first
registering and then annulling the mortgages. The jurisdiction of the Registry Court and the
information at its disposal were limited. A different matter is the expectation to which registration
may have given rise as regards the validity of the Mortgages, particularly where, as here, no

mortgage had previously been invalidated on the basis of PSC. The legitimate expectations of the

Claimant are dealt with separately within the overall claim of breach of FET (see paragraphs 492-
496 below).

As regards the different treatment of Manchester’ QD 0 GEE Viorizages, in the

different cases, it might be relevant to restate here that different protagonists were involved in

473,

a

the two cases. Before the Supreme Court, Manchester was the defendant one time and the
claimant three times. In the GED case, a group of Prospective Buyers acted against
GD en Manchester, which was therefore a defendant in the case, and the Supreme Court
decided that the QED Mortgage was against PSC.” In the QB Mortgage case,
Manchester was the claimant and asked the Supreme Court to invalidate the Mortgage. The
Supreme Court rejected the request, stating that the (MD Mortgage was not against PSC, as
mentioned in the preceding section.”°

474. Manchester's Mortgage was also examined by the Supreme Court in the Band
ERD cases. In the (BD case, Manchester was the claimant and acted against the estate of
Mi z=. order to have its mortgage enforced, but the Supreme Court decided that the
GRD Mortgage was against PSC.”*! In the (ED case, Manchester was again the claimant

and acted against a commercial entity > in order to have its mortgage enforced, and in this
case, the Supreme Court found for Manchester, deciding that the ED Morigage was not
against PSC.”?

475. The Tribunal at the outset wishes to make clear that, in its consideration of these cascs, it will not
enter into the question of whether the decisions of the Supreme Court on the applicability of PSC
under the Polish Civil Code are consistent. The Tribunal will limit its analysis to the alleged
inconsistency of the Supreme Court in considering itself bound or not by the facts found by the

lower courts; a matter that, as noted earlier, raises issues of due process.

476. In the (MD case, the Court of Appeal found that the defendant had not proven collusion
between the Claimant andi Similarly, the Court of Appeal in he
that the Prospective Buyers did not “point to any circumstance that could have constituted
evidence of collusion between the defendants [Manchester es aimed at harming the
claimants [the Prospective Buyers].””* The Supreme Court in the BBB case held that it was

PCA Case No. 2015-18

The allegation of a violation of Art. 58 §2 of the Civil Code in conjunction with Art. 76 sec. 4
of the LMRM Act by failing to take into account that an act in law consisting in the establishment
of the mortgage in dispute was contrary to the principles of social co-existence and for this
reason invalid, cannot have the desired effect... The appellant totally disregards the binding

findings of the Court of Appeal, from whic! it foll ws that thi id in law was
not to cause harm to her legal predecessor: that jused the funds obtained from the
i he bond: investments; that it was not declared bankrupt until tw« if
years after ie cooperation agreement was concluded with the claimant; and iat the reason for
ban! y was a whole series of business moves] that were not full: it_out
especial errors i the assessment of m: isms and jts own

capabilities and resources.
477. The Supreme Court in the QB ase ignored the findings of fact of the Court of Appeal
and concluded “that the action taken by defendant [Manchester] to secure its interests as a new
creditor of the developer was one of the planned results of the dishonest conduct of the developer,

with that defendant being aware of that dishonesty.””**

478, The Supreme Court considered again Manchester's QED Morteage in the case. The
Court viewed as incffective the allegation of breach of Article 58(2) of the Civil Code. According
to the Court, for an act to qualify as contrary to PSC, the content, intended purpose and expected
consequences are of decisive importance. The Court stated that by introducing “unclear criteria”,
PSC “may pose a threat to the security of commercial transactions” and indicated that they should

be applied cautiously and to flagrant cases.”*° The Court found that:

Just entering into a transaction simply being aware of the existence of third party rights
established earlier cannot really be treated as one of such cases. In order to have the effect
provided under Art. 58 § 2 of the Civil Code, the conduct of the parties to a transaction must
also impair other values accepted in society.”>”

479. The Supreme Court emphasized that compliance of an act with PSC is an issue of factual context.
The Supreme Court recalled that it takes the stance that “the states of human awareness such as
the will, the purpose of the action, the intention of the parties to the agreement, are an element of

factual findings excluded from review by way of a cassation appeal.””** The Supreme Court held:

[The view presented in the appeal disregards the findings as to the facts binding on the Supreme

Court, adopted as the basis for the judgment under appeal. It di 11 follow from those findings

conclude that it was structured in a manner actually | Dreventing the developer from fulfilling its
obligations towards the purchas f the premises.”

480, It is noteworthy that the factual findings of the Court of Appeal were the same in all three cases.
I is equally notable that the Supreme Court did not consider itself bound by the factual findings
of the Court of Appeal in the EEE “ase, but did so in the ED onc ases. For the
Tribunal, it is not a question of whether the Supreme Court committed a procedural error, but
whether the error was committed selectively to justify a finding against Manchester, the
defendant in the case of the GED Mortgage and the claimant in the QED case. The
finding in favor of Manchester in theB case was to no avail, as explained below,

In the (BD ond QP cases, the Supreme Court found the ED Mortgage to be against
PSC in the} ase" and not against PSC in thef{icase." The distinction between these
two cases is that (9 was a business entity as opposed to the heirs of Mr. ? This
differentiation between consumers and business entities for purposes of finding whether PSC
have been violated was not taken into account by the Supreme Court in theEEED “ase. The
Supreme Court assumed that all the Prospective Buyers were consumers and ignored the fact that
part of the ED Property consisted of commercial units as some Prospective
Buyers were business entities.“* Furthermore, the protection of consumers as a reason to

invalidate a mortgage for being contrary to PSC would have applied equally to mm |

483, There is no evidence before the Tribunal that the Claimant appealed the decision of he
District Court. A pre-condition for a claim of denial of justice, which would be a breach of FET

under the BIT, is the exhaustion of local remedies.”** But the local remedies rule requires that

Aws
remedies be exhausted only once; it does not require appealing twice or more to the Supreme
Court on the same matter. The District Court decision shows that, even when the Supreme Court
upheld the validity and enforceability of the Mortgage in thease, a lower level
court disregarded the Supreme Court’s ruling with the sole purpose of invalidating ra
Mortgage.

To conclude, the Tribunal finds that the Supreme Court rulings discriminated against the
Claimant’s investment and that, when they did not in the sole instance of the EB case, a lower
court disregarded the Supreme Court ruling to the detriment of the Claimant with the result that,
among the lenders to real estate developers, only the Claimant carried the burden of Poland’s
failure to protect real estate developers’ clients. The Tribunal concludes that there has been
discrimination towards the Claimant in respect to the (EEEBMorigage. The Tribunal will
continue to address the difference of treatment under the allegation of interference in the judicial

proceedings.

{iv) Did the Respondent interfere in the judicial proceedings?

As proof of interference, the Claimant lists the following circumstances: (i) on 25 June 2009,
MPs filed a written appeal with the Bankruptcy Court in {iicalting upon the Court to protect
the Prospective Buyers; (ii) on 17 July 2009, the Public Prosecutor joined the QED “ase
and called for the invalidation of the (EEN Mortgage: (iii) on 26 October 2009, the Public
Prosecutor issued the Prosecutor’s Order to prevent the sale of the QED ropeny in the
course of the Bankruptcy Proceedings; (iv) on 20 February 2012, the Public Prosecutor General
called for the invalidation of the QED Mortgage: and (v) the Polish Parliament enacted the
Apartment Buycr Protection Act, which encouraged the Supreme Court to invalidate the
GERD Mortgage. The Tribunal will examine each of these circumstances in turn.

 

MPs appealed to the Bankruptcy Court in the context of GED bankruptcy after customers
of GB 2c come to the members’ offices for several months asking for help. In their appeal,
the MPs stated: “We feel obliged towards our voters to take action that could help them in the
dramatic situation in which they have found themselves. We are impressed by the resolve,
consistency and coherence of the actions of the people united under the common heading of

GERD ©’ The appeal concluded in the following terms:

In view of the declaration of bankruptcy of QED we are putting forward a
wholehearted appeal for any decisions that are to be made to take into account the particularly

the case of a denial of justice under customary international law. He notes that it is not necessary to decide that
issue here, however, inasmuch as in fact local remedies have been exhausted,

socially significant and human aspect of the problem, and not contribute to the further worsening
of the situation of customers We trust that, given the willingness to cooperate
declared by the customers of the developer, it will be possible to work out a solution
satisfactory to all parties.”**
The Tribunal observes that the appeal refers generally to the bankruptcy = It mentions
specifically the customers of (NEED erouped under the QED banner but there is no
reference to any particular mortgage. The appeal makes reference to several dozen cases in the
courts of ED against the developer and Manchester, but the conclusion is couched in terms

of reaching a solution satisfactory to al] parties concerned,

The interventions of the Public Prosecutor on 17 July and 26 October 2009 can hardly be qualified
as external interference. Public prosecutors are an integral part of a justice system. Even if, as
argued by the Claimant, the Public Prosecutor was not obliged to intervene in a case such as that
of the aa Mortgage, the Claimant itself recognized that the Public Prosecutor’s
intervention may have been unusual but remained within the ambit of its discretion.” The order
seizing the Property as evidence and prohibiting the Bankruptcy Trustee from selling
it in the course of the Bankrupicy Proceedings was appealed by the Bankruptcy Trustee on
4 November 2009 and the Claimant on 24 November 2009.” The order was quashed by the
GERD eeciona Court.”*! The Court found that the Prosecutor’s Order lacked legal basis. Thus,
the Bankruptcy Trustee and the Claimant availed themselves of the available remedies and
succeeded.

The Public Prosecutor General intervened at the request of the Supreme Court in the appeal of
the Claimant against the decision of the ES Court of Appeal in thease. The Supreme
Court requested that the Public Prosecutor General state in writing her opinion on the cassation
appeal filed by the defendant against the judgment of the Court of Appeal of 22 June 2010.7?
The Tribunal fails to see how, by expressing her opinion at the request of the Supreme Court, the
Public Prosccutor General could have been guilty of an “external interference” with the Polish
judiciary.

to protect real estate developers’ customers.’* In turn, according to the Claimant, MPs applied
pressure on the Minister of Justice, who declared in August 2011 that “the Polish Parliament was
working on a new law which would protect the real estate developers’ clients.”" The
Respondent has described a broader situation of bankruptcies of real estate developers nationwide
that prompted the Government to take remedial action. It has denied that he

Association played any key role in the legislative process.’

The record shows that the Prospective EE uyers mobilized to seek a change in the law
to remedy their predicament. From the record, they seem to have been effective in catalyzing
support for legislative change. The fact that they reached out to Parliament to pass a new law of
general application to protect of real estate pers and the di

with which Parliament processed the new law do not substantiate the claim of external
interference in the judiciary. The Apartment Buyer Protection Act’s relevance is limited to the
allegation that the Supreme Court applied it before it became effective. The Act provided
specifically for its future application. Whether or not the Supreme Court applied it before it

entered into force, it cannot be said that the Parliament “encouraged the Supreme Court to
invalidate the ED Mortgage.”

To conclude, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent did not interfere in the judicial proceedings.

(v) — Was there a frustration of the Claimant's legitimate expectations?

Legitimate and reasonable expectations are “the dominant element” of the FET standard™** and
“central” in its definition.” However, both Parties’ expectations need to be taken into account
and, in order for them to be protected, “[they] must rise to the level of legitimacy and

reasonableness in light of the circumstances.”7*

The Claimant has argued that it could not have expected that the establishment of mortgages,
which of itself was lawful, not restricted by the Preliminary Agreements and consistent with

market practice, would be contrary to PSC when no mortgage ever had previously been

invalidated on the basis of those principles. The Claimant also has pointed out that the

Respondent took other actions that prevented Manchester from enforcing its claims, namely, the

Second and Third Injunctions, the Prosecutor's Order, the Supreme Court ruling in nD
case and, ultimately, the transfer of apartments to the Prospective Buyers.”°

The Respondent has contested the claim of legitimate expectations by arguing that the Claimant’s
expectations could not be legitimate because they were contrary to PSC as provided by Polish
law. Furthermore, the Claimant could not have legitimate expectations because registration of

the mortgages was presumptive.”*°

The Tribunal has already determined that the Claimant did not act in bad faith (see
paragraphs 392-402 above). In the view of the Tribunal, it would have been reasonable for the
Claimant to expect that mortgages registered after the vetting of the Registry Court would be
prima facie valid under Polish law, as a business expectation. But for an investor’s expectation

to be i as a legiti ion protected by it ional law, more than

the existence of a general legal framework is needed. As observed by the £/ Paso tribunal:

A reasonable general regulation can be considered a violation of the FET standard if it violates

a specific commitment towards the investor. The Tribunal considers that a special commitment

by the State towards an investor provides the latter with a certain protection against changes in

the legislation, but it needs to discuss more thoroughly the concept of “specific commitments.”

In the Tribunal's view, no general definition of what constitutes a specific commitment can be

given, as all depends on the circumstances. However, it seems that two types of commitments

might be considered “specific”: those specific as to their addressee and those specific regarding

their object and purpose. *!
The Tribunal understands that registration is only presumptive, and considers that it cannot be
considered as a specific commitment giving rise to an internationally protected legitimate

expectation.

(vi) Overall conclusion on the claim of denial of justice as a breach of FET

The Tribunal has concluded that the investment of the Claimant was subject to arbitrary and
discriminatory treatment. Did this treatment rise to the level of a denial of justice? The Supreme
Court held that “the states of human awareness such as the will, the purpose of the action, the
intention of the parties to the agreement, are an element of factual findings excluded from review
by way of a cassation appeal.””’ This holding notwithstanding, the Supreme Court in the
Gc ase engaged in a review of factual findings of the Court of Appeal. At variance with

Award

the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court found that (ID acted dishonestly, and that the

Claimant conspired w ith HEED dishonest behavior against the Prospective Buyers. This was
a key finding on the basis of which the Supreme Court invalidated the EEIMortgage.

Furthermore, the reliance by the Supreme Court on new findings of fact different from those of
the Court of Appeal resulted in a violation of the Claimant’s due process against which it had no
opportunity to present evidence or legal argument. In these circumstances and in the view of the
Tribunal, the finding that the Claimant conspired dishonestly with GBD cains: the
Prospective Buyers is particularly egregious. For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the

763

Respondent breached the FET standard by committing a denial of justice” in relation to the

Claimant’s investment.”

In view of this conclusion and for reasons of procedural economy, the Tribunal will omit
consideration of the other claims of breach of the BIT since irrespective of whether the Tribunal

upholds them or dismisses them, the amount of damages will be unaffected.

DAMAGES

‘The Claimant has pleaded two alternative damage scenarios: first, if the Tribunal finds that the
invalidation of the Mortgage constituted a breach of the BIT, then the Claimant seeks
compensation in the amount of the QED Harm. Alternatively, if the Tribunal does not
make this finding, the Claimant seeks compensation for the Transfer, QD anc GD
Harms.” Since the Tribunal has found that the invalidation of the QED Morigage
breached the BIT, the Tribunal will only consider the claim for he Harm. The
Claimant has also pleaded for the legal costs related to all heads of damage if the Tribunal would
find that the Claimant is entitled to compensation for them. For the reasons set forth below, the
Tribunal does not need to consider the legal costs claimed by the Claimant for the damages

alternative to the EID farm.

I; Preliminary matters

The Tribunal will first consider two preliminary matters raised by the Parties’ arguments: the

applicable legal standard and causation.

7 Arbitrator Stem considers that denial of justice is the only standard under which an international arbitral
tribunal can review the judgments of the national counts, as it is not a court of appeal.

7 Judge Brower is of the view that the Tribunal could have found that the Respondent breached its FET obligation
on a basis other than denial of justice.

75 Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, {9307-31 2.

130

PCA Case No. 2015-18
Award

(a) Legal standard

502, The Tribunal has found that the Respondent breached the BIT when its Supreme Court committed

a denial of justice because it acted arbitrarily and discriminated against the Claimant in cancelling
the EM ortgage. The Claimant has argued that it is entitled to “full reparation”.”°° The
Respondent contends that the standard to be applied is the standard of reparation for expropriation
found in Article VII of the BIT.””

503. The BIT standard is applicable only in the case of expropriation that meets the conditions set

forth in that article, but it is not applicable in cases where the BIT has been breached. The
applicable standard is that provided by customary international law for wrongful acts of the State
as set forth in the Case Concerning the Factory at Chorzéw™ and reflected in Article 36 of the

ILC Articles.

(b) Causation

504. The Parties hold different views on the link between the cancellation of the iortgage

and the claim for damages. The Claimant contends that the Respondent prevented the
enforcement of the QED Mortgage through injunctions, the Prosecutor's Order, and then
its invalidation. According to the Claimant, were it not for these actions, ED bankruptcy
estate would have been larger and the Claimant could have satisfied a larger portion of its claims
despite the invalidation of the ED Morigaze.”® The Respondent argues that the Claimant
failed to prove the linkage of the acts referred to by the Claimant and the alleged damages.

505. The Tribunal has found that denial of justice against the Claimant was limited to the decision of

the Supreme Court and its aftermath, For this reason, the Tribunal will limit its consideration of
causation to the decision of the Supreme Court. The Tribunal should distinguish between the
effect of the actual discrimination against the Claimant by the different treatment of the
GRD Mor: gage and the valuation of the damage that this effect had. It is to state the obvious
that a creditor in a bankruptcy proceeding who has a credit secured by a mortgage is in a better
position to obtain satisfaction of its claim than a creditor who does not. The question is, what is
the value of this effect? In the case of the Claimant, its claim was displaced from being ranked
second after the @Monzare.” " to being one of the unsecured creditors. It should be noted

that the ranking for the Claimant was not changed when the owners of the apartments or shops
in the ED Property were awarded Compulsory Mortgages since its claim was senior to
theirs. The Claimant's ranking only changed when the Supreme Court invalidated the
Mortgage and, therefore, the Supreme Court’s ruling is the relevant factor for valuing the

displacement of the Claimant as a secured creditor.

2. Calculation of the arm

506. The experts of both Parties adopt the same methodology and approach to the calculation of

damages. They diverge on the assumptions: the assumed date of sale of the ED eroperty,
the justification to adjust the sale price to the nature of the sale — whether or not it was a distressed
sale — and the cost to complete construction of the property. The Parties also differ on whether
legal costs may be included as part of the claim and on whether the applicable pre-award rate of

interest should be the rate of return of Manchester’s parent company or a risk-free interest rate.

(a) The value of the claim

507. The Tribunal observes that multiple mortgages secured the bon’ a
Glee Se Se eee ee
GRD epresented the outstanding claim under the Bond Purchase
Agreement that could be settled from the sale of the (QEEEED Property.’ Additionally, the
Claimant concedes that a deduction should be made for a payment received by Manchester in
2013, in the amount of PLN QEEEEID ”? For this reason, and for purposes of calculating the
GB tam. the Parties’ disagreement on the value of the QED roperty calculated

by the Claimant’s expert, Mr. Grzesik, and relied on by their expert Mr. O’Brien,

 

is irrelevant.

 

As explained by the Claimant, “[e]ven under the valuation presented by the Respondent’s Expert

(i.e. PLN ea. the value of the GRD operty was high enough to cover

Manchester’s claims secured under aS Mortgage. as calculated by the Claimant’s

Exper (PLN ”””

508, The disagreement between the Parties concerns the rate of interest applicable during the two years

 

preceding the date of the bankruptcy. The Claimant contends that the applicable rate is the rate
provided in the Bond Purchase Agreement, while the Respondent claims that the statutory rate

of 13% for late payments is applicable.” The Tribunal recalls that Prof. Swaczyna, the
Claimant’s expert in Polish law, testified that, under Polish law, a mortgage secures interest on
the main claim at the rate provided for in the mortgage deed.” The Tribunal also notes that the
Bankruptcy Trustee calculated the interest on Manchester's claim at the rate of i agreed in
the Bond Purchase Agreement.” The Tribunal finds that this is the applicable rate in calculating
the value of Manchester’s claim. Accordingly, the two-year interest shall be calculated as a
simple interest, at a rate of @er annum on the nominal value of PLN QED 1:
amounts to PLN@
Accordingly, the total amount of the QE iarm is PLN QED (nai is,
aa aaa

(b) Estimated date of sale (start date for the accrual of pre-award interest

The date of sale is the date on which it is estimated that the Claimant would have received the
proceeds of the sale of the (EEE Property. It is therefore the date from which pre-award
interest shall accrue. The Claimant advocates for 3] March 2013, while the Respondent advocates
for 31 December 2014. The date chosen by the Claimant is based on the Bankruptcy Trustee’s
Report of 27 July 2009, in which the Trustee established the order for the planned sale of
GERD cis. The ED Property was to be sold tast by the end of 2011. Thus, after
allowing for some delay, the Claimant has argued that the property would have been sold by the
end of December 2012 and that it would have received proceeds from the sale by 31 March
2013.7” On the other hand, according to the Respondent, 27 June 2014 would have been a more
likely date for the sale; it is the earliest date on which the next tender for the ED rropenty
could have been arranged — three months after the last announcement on 25 March 2014.””* The
Respondent’s damages experts add that Manchester would have received the proceeds six months
after the sale, by 31 December 2014,”

The Claimant has further argued that the alleged breaches of the BIT starting in 2009 affected
the sale process and that “at no point between 2009 and the end of 2012 was there a period of
time whereby the Trustee could have realistically offered the QED roperty to the

market.””° The Respondent contends that the alleged breaches did not affect the timing of the
offer of the Property for sale.”

The Tribunal recalls that the sale of the Property had been planned by the Bankruptcy
Trustee to take place by the end of the Bankruptcy Proceedings. As explained in the Trustee’s
Report:
It will be known by then to what extent the bondholder’s claims will be satisfied from the sale
of other assets and whether it will be possible to agree the cancellation of the mortgage by way
of negotiations with the customers at ul, jand ul. This could potentially
make it possible to perform the preliminary agreement to deliver the premises or —as a last resort
to re-sell the property. The bondholder’s claim would be satisfied in full, and the other funds
would be designated for distribution between the remaining creditors as part of the general
bankruptcy estate.”**
It is also noted that the Bankruptcy Trustee’s plan was illustrative and suffered delays. The

Respondent provides examples:

According to the liquidation plan in the Trustee’s Report, the real property at
ul yas to be sold in the autumn of 2009. It was actually sold
two years later. The real property in| was to have been sold in 2010, It has
still not been sold (seven-year delay from the date on the calendar).”**

The Tribunal is not persuaded that the delay in offering the(EEEED Property for sale can be

attributed to the alleged breaches of the BIT or that the breaches have a bearing on the dates
chosen by the Bankruptcy Trustee to advertise it.

The Parties further disagree on whether the Bankruptcy Trustee made a sufficient effort to sell
the (EEE Property. For background, it will be useful to review the chain of events that
followed the invalidation of the (EID Mortgage by the Supreme Court on 9 February
2012.* The Bankruptcy Trustee attempted to sell the QED Propery on four occasions:
on 16 April 2013, 27 June 2013, 23 September 2013 and 24 March 2014.** On 19 February
2014, thoMEEED Vortgage was removed from the LMR by the Registry Court on application
of the Bankruptcy Trustee just before the last attempt by the Bankruptcy Trustee to sell the
GERD Morzage. The Bankruptcy Court transferred ownership of the opery
to the Prospective{EEEED Buyers on 29 April 2014.7

515. According to the Respondent, the Bankruptcy Trustee fulfilled her advertising obligations:

(2) [she] was obliged to publish the announcements: (i) two weeks before the tender; and (ii) in
at least one local daily; whereas (b) [she] actually published the announcements: (i) 3 weeks

her statutory minimum obligations. Furthermore, the Claimant attributes this conduct to the fact
that, even before any tender for |) *roperty was advertised, the Bankruptcy Trustee
had contemplated, as an alternative to the sale, the transfer of title to the Prospective
Buyers. ”** But this was not possible pending the proceedings of the Registry Court. Ownership
of the (ED Property was transferred to the Prospective WEEE Buyers shortly after
the Registry Court removed the GRR ortgaze from the LMR. As reported by the
Bankruptcy Trustee to the Bankruptcy Court, there had been some interest in purchasing the
GERD P soperty for PLN QED bet 10 formal bid.” At the hearing, Poland

admitted that the Bankruptcy Trustee might have been waiting for the outcome of the mortgage

case."

The Tribunal observes that the Bankruptcy Trustee had no obligation to go beyond the statutory
requirements. It is also a fact that no bids were received at any price, even in the fourth round,
which had no minimum bid requirement and that, by then, the QED Mortgage had been
removed from the LMR. The potential new owners would have had to deal with a difficult
situation of occupied premises, a fact that by itself would likely have had an impact on the sale

irrespective of the Bankruptcy Trustee’s efforts.

The Tribunal is therefore unpersuaded that, as contended by the Claimant, the QD
Property could have been sold in 2013. In the view of the Tribunal, the Claimant could have
obtained the payment of the claims due to it under the Bond Purchase Agreement either following
the sale of the QE} roperty in a further, fifth tender in the bankruptcy proceedings
(assuming th opery would not have been transferred to the Prospective Buyers in
April 2014) or in enforcement proceedings ayainst the Prospective Buyers (assuming that the
transfer did take place). In either case, the Tribunal estimates that, but for the invalidation of the
sa Mortgage, the Claimant would have received the proceeds of the sale of the

PCA Case No, 2015-18
Award
GERD Property around 27 June 2014, which is therefore the date from which pre-award

interest will accrue.

(c) Pre-award interest

As stated in the Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief: “The Parties are not in dispute over whether,
if the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the BIT was breached, it is possible for the injured party to be
awarded pre-award interest.””! However, they disagree on the applicable rate of interest. The
Claimant has argued for a rate equivalent to the average rate of return of investments of QD
given the nature of its business.”” The Respondent, based on the report of its damages experts,
stated that “only a risk-free interest rate which only reflects the time value of money should be
applied and yield rates of government bonds are a widely accepted approximation of the risk-free

rate. In the case of PLN, this is the rate on Polish government bonds.””*

Article VII of the BIT provides for “interest at a commercially reasonable rate, such as LIBOR
plus an appropriate margin, from the date of expropriation; be fully realizable: be freely
transferable; and calculated on the basis of the prevailing market rate of exchange for commercial
transactions on the date of expropriation.” While the standard established in Article VII applies,
stricto sensu, only in the case of expropriations that meet the conditions set forth in that article,
the Tribunal considers that it nevertheless provides a reasonable guide to interest in the present
case. The Tribunal further considers that to apply the average rate of return of the parent company
of the Claimant would be unusual and highly speculative. First, the rate of return is not “a
commercially reasonable rate.” Second, it would be the rate of return of investments of the
Claimant's parent company, which is not a party to these proceedings. Third, the average rate of
Tetum of GED bscures the actual rate of return of specific investments, in the instant case, the
GERD vestment; such rate would tum this Award into an insurance

policy against the risks inherent in the investment.

The risk-free rate of 1.78% advanced by the Respondent is the rate on its own bonds and not
necessarily a reasonable commercial rate. The BIT does not require that the rate be risk-free. It
only requires that the interest rate be reasonable and the added margin be appropriate. The
Respondent has also referred to the international practice of using LIBOR or LIBOR plus a low
margin and stated that the LIBOR plus a margin rate follows also from Article VII of the BIT.”*

The Claimant, in the alternative, has referred to the statutory rate applicable to late payments in

Poland ranging from 5 to 13% per annum, to the WIBOR three-month rate plus four percentage

points or to “such commercial rate the Tribunal may deem appropriate.”

The Tribunal notes that the claim is in PLN and hence the applicable rate should be a reasonable
commercial rate for borrowing in PLN. The Tribunal considers that the average WIBOR annual
tate of interest for PLN between 27 June 2014 and the date of the Award plus two percentage
points, which amounts to 3.88%, would be a reasonable commercial rate. As stated at

paragraph 518 above, interest shall accrue from 27 June 2014.

(d) Legal costs

The Parties disagree on whether the claim for legal costs incurred by the Claimant in previous
domestic proceedings may be claimed as part of the compensation for breach of the BIT in the
form of a denial of justice. The Claimant has referred in support to the award in the case of
Inmaris et al. v. Ukraine.” In that case, the tribunal “concluded that Respondent's act caused
Claimants’ insolvency, and, therefore, Respondent is responsible for compensating Claimants for
the resulting harm, including with respect to the payment of insolvency costs.”””’ In opposing the
claim for legal costs for proceedings before domestic courts, the Respondent found support in the
case of Petrobart v. Kyrgyszian. The tribunal in that case held that “[t}he costs relating to these
previous proceedings were - or should have been — finally settled in connection with those
proceedings, and the Arbitral Tribunal finds no basis for granting compensation for them in the

present arbitration proceedings.””*

The Tribunal has considered these opposing arguments. The Tribunal has found that the
cancellation of the GD Morigage by the Supreme Court was a discriminatory and
arbitrary act that amounted to a denial of justice. The Claimant availed itself of access to the
Respondent's courts to defend its rights in a series of lawsuits brought by private parties. The
Tribunal does not consider that the legal costs of the Claimant incurred in defense of its rights in
these circumstances should be compensated by the Respondent.” As the Petrobart tribunal
found, these costs were or should have been settled in the proceedings preceding this arbitration.

apply to all legal costs incurred by the Claimant in relation to the other heads of damage pleaded

in this proceeding.
3. The issue of double recovery

The Respondent alerted the Tribunal to the risk of double recovery.*’ As pointed out by the
Respondent. (REED cbt to the Claimant has been recognized in the Bankruptcy Proceedings.
If the claim for redress of the (EBD Harm is upheld in full by the Tribunal, it might lead to
the Claimant being compensated in excess of the damage. At the hearing, the Respondent
proposed that the Tribunal defer its award on quantum until the end of the Bankruptcy
Proceedings or that the Tribunal deduct the amounts that the Claimant could potentially recover
in those proceedings from the amounts granted in this Award.*"'

‘The Claimant has opposed the Respondent’s solutions to avoid double recovery. The Claimant
has argued that the possibility of recovery in the domestic proceedings is remote and has
expressed its willingness to undertake to notify the Tribunal of any new payments received in the
enforcement and bankruptcy proceedings prior to the issuance of the Award and, if the Tribunal
awards the Claimant’s claim in full and the Respondent pays it in full, to reimburse the
Respondent in the amount of any recovery received from the enforcement and bankruptcy
proceedings to the extent they overlap with payments made by the Respondent pursuant to the
award, The Claimant has also offered to
withdraw its claims in the bankruptcy or enforcement proceedings in Poland agains
bankruptcy estate and other debtors in relation to the Bond [Purchase] Agreement, up to the
amount awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal and paid by Poland (save for any pre- and post-award
interest and costs awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal).*
As observed in Nykomb y, Latvia, “the Treaty based right to arbitration is not excluded or limited
in cases where there is a possible risk of double payment.” Nevertheless, the Tribunal has
considered the Parties’ proposals to alleviate this risk. The Tribunal considers that the
mechanisms proposed by the Respondent and the first alternative proposed by the Claimant are
too uncertain, They would leave these proceedings open for an undetermined period of time, the
amount to be deducted might be estimated too high or too low, or settlement of accounts between
the Parties may last for years beyond the closure of these proceedings. On the other hand, the

Tribunal finds merit in the Claimant’s proposal to withdraw its claims in the bankruptcy and

enforcement proceedings up to the amount awarded by this Tribunal save for pre- and post-award
interest. This proposal has the advantage that it does not leave these proceedings or settlement of

accounts between the Parties open for an indefinite period.

4. Post-award interest

The Claimant has requested that the Tribunal “order the Respondent to pay the Claimant post-
award interest at such commercial rate the Tribunal may deem appropriate.”"** The Respondent
has not argued for a different rate should the Tribunal find in favor of the Claimant, The Tribunal
has already decided in the case of pre-award interest what it considers an appropriate commercial
interest rate (see paragraph 522 above). The same annual rate of interest shall apply to the amount
awarded and it shall accrue as from 60 days of the date of this Award,

Costs
1. Allocation of costs

Each Party has pleaded that the Tribunal order the other to pay all the costs of this arbitration and
its costs of legal representation and assistance.*®* Under Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules,
the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party, but “the arbitral
tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment
is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.” As regards the costs of legal
representation and assistance, “the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the
case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs

between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable."

The Tribunal observes that the costs of the arbitration have been financed in equal parts by the
Parties and that neither Party has fully prevailed in its arguments. For these reasons, the Tribunal
considers it reasonable that each Party pay 50% of the arbitration costs and its own costs of legal

representation and assistance.*””

2. Fixing of the costs of the Tribunal and the PCA

Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that the Tribunal “shall fix the costs of arbitration
in its award” and that such costs include only:
(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed
by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;
(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;
(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;

(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the
arbitral tribunal;

(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were
claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal
determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the Secretary-
General of the Permanent Count of Arbitration at The Hague.

In light of the Tribunal’s decision that each Party shall bear its own costs of legal assistance and
representation (see paragraph 530 above), there is no need to fix the costs under Article 38(d)
and (e). No costs under Article 38(f) have been incurred in these proceedings. The costs of
arbitration under Article 38(a). (b) and (c) are fixed in the following paragraphs.

‘The fees and expenses in these proceedings of Judge Charles N. Brower, the arbitrator appointed
on behalf of the Claimant, amount respectively to USD 227,300.00 and USD 5,534.50.

The fees and expenses in these proceedings of Professor Brigitte Stern, the arbitrator appointed
on behalf of the Respondent, amount respectively to USD 130,250.00 and USD 10,455.44.

The fees and expenses in these proceedings of Dr. Andrés Rigo Sureda, the Presiding Arbitrator,
amount respectively to USD 189,750.00 and USD 9,143.63.

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 1, the PCA was designated to serve as registry
in these proceedings. The PCA’s fees and expenses amount respectively to USD 109,637.54 and
USD 2,572.09.

Other arbitration costs, including the costs of hearing facilities, court reporters, interpretation, IT
equipment, bank transactions, and all other expenses relating to the proceedings, amount to
USD 66,331.88.

Based on the above figures, the costs of the Tribunal and the PCA, comprising the items covered
in Article 38(a) to (c) of the UNCITRAL Rules, total USD 750,975.08.

The Parties made deposits for the costs of arbitration in these proceedings in equal shares, in a
total amount of USD 800,000.00. In accordance with Article 41(5) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the

PCA will return the unused balance, in an amount of 49,024.92, to the Parties in equal shares.
