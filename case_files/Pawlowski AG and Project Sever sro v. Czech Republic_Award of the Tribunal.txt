THE TREATY: DISPUTE RESOLUTION CLAUSE
Article 9 of the BIT provides:
Article 9

Disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor
of the other Contracting Party

1. For the purpose of solving disputes with respect to investments between a
Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party and without
prejudice to Article 10 of this Agreement (Disputes between Contracting
Parties), consultations will take place between the parties concerned.

2. If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months, the
dispute shall upon request of the investor be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.
Such arbitral tribunal shall be established as follows:

a) The arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case.
Unless the parties to the dispute have agreed otherwise, each of them
shall appoint one arbitrator and these two arbitrators shall nominate a
chairman who shall be a national of a third State. The arbitrators are
to be appointed within two months of the receipt of the request for
arbitration and the chairman is to be nominated within further two
months.

b) If the periods specified in paragraph (a) of this Article have not
been observed, either party to the dispute may, in the absence of any
other arrangements, invite the President of the Court of Arbitration of
the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris to make the
necessary appointments. If the President is prevented from carrying
out the said function or if he is a national of a Contracting Party the
provisions in paragraph (5) of Article 10 of this Agreement shall be
applied mutatis mutandis.

c) Unless the parties to the dispute have agreed otherwise, the tribunal
shall determine its procedure. Its decisions are final and binding. Each
Contracting Party shall ensure the recognition and execution of the
arbitral award.

d) Each party to the dispute shall bear the costs of its own member of
the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the
costs of the chairman and the remaining cost shall be borne in equal
parts by both parties to the dispute. The tribunal may, however, in its
award decide on a different proportion of costs to be borne by the
parties and this award shall be binding on both parties.

3. In the event of both Contracting Parties having become members of the
Convention of Washington of March 18, 1965 on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, disputes
under this article may, upon request of the investor, as an alternative to the
procedure mentioned in paragraph 2 of this article, be submitted to the
International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes.

4. The Contracting State which is a party to the dispute shall at no time

or during the execution of the respective sentence assert as a defense the fact
that the investor has received compensation under an insurance contract
covering the whole or part of the incurred damage.

5. Neither Contracting State shall pursue through diplomatic channels a
dispute submitted to arbitration, unless the other Contracting State does not
abide by or comply with the award rendered by an arbitral tribunal.

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 7 April 2017, ICSID received a request for arbitration from Pawlowski AG and
Projekt Sever s.r.o. against the Czech Republic (the “Request”).

On 14 April 2017, ICSID asked the requesting parties to provide further
information in support of the Request. That information was submitted on 2 May
2017.

On 3 May 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request, as
supplemented, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and
notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-
General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as
possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the
Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

The Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of
the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators,
one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding, arbitrator to be appointed
by agreement of the Parties.

The Tribunal is composed of Juan Fernandez-Armesto, a national of Spain,
President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; John Beechey, a national of the
United Kingdom, appointed by the Claimants; and Vaughan Lowe, a national of
the United Kingdom, appointed by the Respondent.

On 6 November 2017, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1)
of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration
Rules”), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their
appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted
on that date. Ms. Lindsay Gastrell, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve
as Secretary of the Tribunal. Ms. Gastrell was subsequently replaced by Ms. Anna
Holloway, Legal Counsel.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session
with the Parties on 24 January 2018 by teleconference.

Following the first session, on 23 February 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural
Order No.1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters.
Procedural Order No. | provided, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules
would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural language would
be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Paris, France. Procedural
Order No. | also set out the agreed schedule for the proceedings.

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, on 28 June 2018, the Claimants filed a
Memorial on the merits, together with the Witness Statements of Mr. Sebastian
Pawlowski, Mr. Milan Coller, Dr. Robert Zugar, Mr. Marek Tichy, and Mr. Martin

Langmajer, the Expert Reports of Dr. Veronica Tomoszkova (including Exhibits
VT-0001 through VT-0024), Mr. Kai Schumacher of AlixPartners GmbH
(including Exhibits AP-001 through AP-074), Exhibits C-0016 through C-0100,
and Legal Authorities CL-0001 through CL-0048).

On 25 July 2018, the Respondent confirmed that it would not request bifurcation
of the proceeding.

On 14 August 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning
production of documents.

On 6 November 2018, the Respondent requested a three-week extension for filing
of its Counter-Memorial citing difficulties in meeting the original deadline due to
a number of departures at the division of the Ministry of Finance in charge of
investment arbitration and other parallel filings that the state had to manage.

On 7 November 2018, the Claimants opposed the Respondent’s request for
extension noting that no compelling reason was stated to justify such an extension
which would unduly disrupt the procedural calendar. In the event that the extension
were granted to the Respondent, the Claimants argued, a corresponding extension
for the Claimants would serve no practical purpose as the Claimants’ counsel
would be engaged in another hearing at that time.

On 9 November 2018, the Tribunal decided to grant an additional three weeks to
each Party for preparation of their briefs. The Tribunal gave the Parties the liberty
of choosing how they each wished to allocate the total additional time between the
two written submissions each Party still had to present.

On 19 November 2018, the Parties submitted agreed amendments to the procedural
timetable and the Tribunal adopted those amendments on 28 November 2018.

In accordance with the amended timetable, on 5 December 2018, the Respondent
filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Preliminary Objections,
together with the Witness Statements of Dr. TomaS Hudeéek and Ms. Véra
Topiéova, the Expert Reports of KPMG (including Exhibits KPMG-1 through
KPMG-6) and Prof. Stanislav Kadecéka (including Exhibits SK-1 through SK-84),
Exhibits R-1 through R-26, and Legal Authorities RL-1 through RL-143).

On 13 March 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning
production of documents.

On 3 July 2019, the Claimants filed a Reply on the Merits and a Counter-Memorial
on Preliminary Objections, together with the Witness Statements of Mr. Boek
Votava, Mr. Frantisek Novaéek, Mr. Jaroslav Maléanek, and Mr. Martin
Turnovsky, the Second Witness Statements of Mr. Sebastian Pawlowski, Mr. Milan
Coller, Mr. Martin Langmajer, and Mr. Marek Tichy, Second Expert Reports of
Prof. Dr. Veronika Tomoscova, (including Annexes | through 6 and Exhibits VT-
0025 through VT-0083) and Mr. Kai Schumacher of AlixPartners GmbH

Exhibits C-0076a, C-0106 through C-0212, and Legal Authorities CL-0049
through CL-0108.

On 6 November 2019, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on the Merits and a Reply
on Preliminary Objections, together with the Witness statements of Ms. Silvie
Stépankova, Mr. Ondréj Bohaé, and Mr. Matéj Stropnicky, the Second Witness
statements of Ms. Véra Topi¢ova and Dr. Tomas Hudeéek, the Second Expert

and KPMG (including Exhibits KPMG-7 through KPMG-37), Exhibits R-27
through R-76, and Legal Authorities RL-144 through RL-212.

On 28 November 2019, the Claimants requested leave to submit new evidence into
the record. The Respondent confirmed that it had no objection on 5 December
2019, following which, on 8 December 2019, the Tribunal instructed the Claimant
to file new exhibits.

On 4 December 2019, the Claimants filed a Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections,
together with Legal Authorities CL-0109 and CL-0110.

On 11 December 2019, the Claimants submitted additional Exhibits C-0213
through C-0215 in accordance with the Tribunal’s instructions.

On 16 December 2019, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing
organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference.

On 17 December 2019, the Claimants requested leave to submit additional
evidence and indicated that the Respondent did not object to the request.

The Tribunal granted leave to the Claimants to submit two new additional exhibits
on 19 December 2019, pursuant to which, on 20 December 2019, the Claimants
submitted further Exhibits C-0216 and C-0217.

On 6 January 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning the
organization of the hearing.

On 7 January 2020, in response to a request from the Respondent, the Claimants
submitted replacement versions of the Exhibits AP-083 and AP-084 to Mr.
Schumacher’s Second Expert Report, containing additional translations.

A hearing on jurisdiction, merits and quantum was held in Paris, France from 26
January to 30 January 2020 (the “Hearing”). The following persons were present

On 10 March 2020, the Claimants submitted an agreed translation of Exhibit H-3
and a replacement page for Exhibit C-135 in accordance with the Parties’
agreement.

On 16 April 2020, the Secretary-General notified the Members of the Tribunal and
the Parties that Ms. Anna Holloway, ICSID Legal Counsel, would be replacing Ms.
Lindsay Gastrell as Secretary of the Tribunal.

On 24 April 2020, the Claimants requested an extension of the remaining deadlines
in the post-Hearing procedural calendar, indicating that the Respondent had agreed
to the proposed extensions.

On 27 May 2020, the Claimants requested leave to submit new evidence,
specifically, a new exhibit containing a Facebook post of Ms. Silvie Stépankova,
one of the witnesses who had testified at the Hearing on behalf of the Respondent.
The Claimants cited Ms. Stépénkova’s alleged “untruthful testimony” as an
exceptional circumstance to justify the admission of new evidence.

After invitation from the Tribunal, on 3 June 2020, the Respondent submitted its
comments upon the Claimants’ request. The Respondent maintained that the
request was “belated and unwarranted.” It argued that the Claimants’ request
should be rejected noting that the allegedly new evidence had been available to the
Claimants since before this arbitration proceeding began. The introduction of the
proposed new evidence would cause prejudice to the Respondent since Ms.
Stépankova would not be able to respond to it.

On 16 June 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 allowing the
Claimants to submit the requested new evidence and allowing the Respondent, in
turn, to submit an affidavit from Ms. Stépankova addressing the new evidence. The
Tribunal also granted the extensions on the remaining procedural submissions.

In accordance with the Tribunal’s directions, on 18 June 2020, the Claimant filed
an additional exhibit C-219. The Respondent submitted the Affidavit of Ms. Silvie
Stépankova on 29 June 2020.

The Parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs on 15 July 2020, and their
submissions on costs on 6 August 2020.

The proceeding was closed on 5 October 2021.

Il.FACTS

Mr. Sebastian Pawlowski, a citizen of Switzerland, is the 100% shareholder and
sole statutory representative of Pawlowski AG; he is also the executive director of
Projekt Sever s.r.0, which is 100% owned by Pawlowski AG.!

Mr. Pawlowski was among the first foreigners to begin investing in the Czech
Republic in the early 1990s.” Over time, Mr. Pawlowski became involved in a
variety of entrepreneurial and non-profit activities in the Czech Republic, primarily
through Pawlowski AG. These activities included his involvement and
participation in numerous large scale property developments, his co-founding of a
business with retail locations throughout the Czech Republic and his investment in
several news and media companies in the country. Mr. Pawlowski has also been
involved in the development of cultural centers in the country. He is the founder of
the Franz Kafka Museum and the Alphonse Mucha Museum, both of which are
located in Prague.*

The City of Prague

Following a peaceful transition of power, the country then known as
Czechoslovakia held its first democratic elections in half a century in the summer
of 1990. Not long thereafter, in 1993 Czechoslovakia peacefully split into the
independent countries of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. The Czech
Republic’s new government implemented a number of economic reforms,
including the privatization of state-owned industry and the removal of price
controls, as the country worked towards the goal of establishing a robust market
economy.

Due to these changes, the City of Prague developed rapidly and became an
important economic centre. Today it is one of the most economically developed
areas within the European Union.* Prague’s economic growth has attracted many
people to move to the city, resulting in consistent high demand for residential real
estate. This demand is expected to continue to grow, as the city’s strong economy
and very low unemployment attract new residents, with estimates forecasting a
20% population increase by 2050.°

The City of Prague is the highest municipal authority. It is headed by three
democratically elected bodies: the Mayor, the Prague City Council and the Prague
City Assembly. Management, directed by a Chief Executive, is divided into various
sections, including the Spatial Planning and Development Sections (the latter

subsequently renamed Prague Institute of Planning and Development), which is
responsible for zoning issues.”

56. Within the City of Prague there are 57 Municipal Districts — or boroughs — each
with its own legislative branch (the District Assembly) and executive branch (the
District Council and District Mayor). Prague’s Municipal Districts are congregated
into 22 numbered administrative districts, which perform administrative functions
for the Municipal Districts within their zone.* One such administrative district is
“Prague-22 Uhiinéves” — which performs administrative functions for itself and
four neighbouring Municipal Districts, including the District of Benice?.

57. The dispute in the present case relates to the change of the zoning regulation
affecting a certain tract of land, with an area of approximately 270,000 m? !° located
in the Municipal District of Benice and bordering the District of Uhrinéves (the
“Project Area”). The Project Area is shown on this cadastral map:'!

 

58. To properly understand the dispute, the Tribunal will first explain how zoning plan
changes are procured and approved in the City of Prague [1.] and thereafter it will
describe how the zoning plan of the Project Area changed over time [2.].

1. THE PROCUREMENT OF ZO)

 

PLANS

59. Land use planning in the Czech Republic is administered through a combination of
state administration and territorial self-governance.'? Generally, the designated use
for land in the Czech Republic is established through two higher planning norms:
the “Spatial Development Policy”, which coordinates the land planning activities
of the different regions, and the “Regional Development Principles”, which
establishes a strategic plan for the development of a specific territory.!*

60. The procurement of a zoning plan change typically proceeds through several
established steps, with each stage involving notification to and comment from
various authorities, city Districts and the public. Proposed changes to Prague's land
use plan are so frequent that they are grouped together into so-called “waves”,
which proceed through the process together.'* Overall, the process for a zoning
change of the land use plan is a long and democratic administrative process, which
is divided into several consecutive steps and which requires decision-making from
the Prague City Assembly (the highest political body, elected by the citizens of
Prague) at all relevant stages. '>

61. First Phase — Decision to Procure: the initial step is a formal act (a “Decision to
Procure’’) in which the Prague City Council initiates a zoning plan change. This
may be made at the request of any municipal District, acting on its own initiative,
or on the initiative of a private individual. However, any initiative for a zoning plan
change by a private individual still must be submitted via the municipal District in
which the area is located.!°

62. Second Phase — Approval of an “Outline”: the second phase requires the Zoning
Plan Division of the Prague Municipal Office (the “Procurer”) to prepare a draft
Outline, which is made available for review and comment by all interested
Authorities and city Districts, as well as by the public; thereafter, the Prague City
Assembly must approve the Outline. !”

63. Third Phase — the “Concept”: If the Outline includes a requirement for an
environmental impact assessment, the elaboration and approval of a zoning change
Concept is the next stage of the procurement process. '* During the procurement of

the Concept, the environmental authority must approve the environmental impact
assessment. The Concept is again subject to public discussion. !

64. Fourth Phase — the preparation of a “Draft’’: Based on public discussion and all the
submitted statements, comments and objections, the Procurer prepares a Draft.
Then, the Draft zoning change is subject to public discussion and all interested
authorities and the superior planning authority submit their statements.”! After the
public discussion, the Procurer assesses the results of the public discussion and, if
necessary, weighs competing views, reviews the compliance of the draft with the
law and superior land use planning documents and prepares the reasoning for the
zoning change.”

65. Final Phase — Approval: The Prague City Assembly considers the Draft, including
the reasoning, and approves it by majority. The approved zoning change is issued
in the legal form of a measure of general nature.?

2. CHANGE IN THE ZONING PLAN OF THE PROJECT AREA

66. At the beginning of the XXI Century, the Project Area was zoned for “recreation”,
“growing vegetables”, and “gardens and allotments.”** As it is close to the
metropolitan area, and there is a high demand for new housing projects, there was
a keen interest in changing the permitted use of the land, so as to authorise
residential use. There were two attempts to obtain such re-zoning.

2.1 FIRST REZONING ATTEMPT: Z 0592/04

67. Sometime in the early 2000s a first change in the zoning plan of the Project Area
was formally initiated and discussed within the administration of the City of
Prague; the request, which received the number Z 0592/04, proposed that the use
of the land be reclassified as residential with housing for approximately 800
residents.*> The map below, taken from file Z 0592/04, establishes that this first
attempt affected the Project Area:”°

NAVRHOVANA ZMENA : [—] 06, 12, ZN MERITKO 1 : 10000

   

The first attempt was unsuccessful: in August 2002, file Z 0592/04 received a
negative opinion from the Environmental Division, because of its proximity to a
natural park:

“From the viewpoint of the interests protected by us, the change is
inadmissible — the Botié — Miliéov natural park.” *”

On the basis of this negative opinion, the proposed change was rejected by the
Prague City Assembly on 29 May 2003.7*

SECOND REZONING ATTEMPT: Z 1294/06

The second attempt to re-zone the Project Area, instigated by the owners of 17 real
estate units’, was filed before the first zoning change had been formally rejected.
On 13 March 2002, the Benice District Assembly approved this second proposal.*°
A few months thereafter, on 10 July 2002, the Uhiinéves District Assembly ratified
the request.*!

A year later, on 2 October 2003, when Z 0592/04 had already been formally
dismissed, the Deputy Mayor of Uhiinéves, Mr. Martin Langmajer, transferred the
proposed zoning amendment (Z 1294/06) to the Development Section of the
Municipal Office of Prague**. A later submission, dated 26 April 2004, specified
that what was being requested was a change in the use of the Project Area from

agricultural use to “purely residential use”, consisting of “low buildings with
envisaged use rate code C.”** The reason given for the proposed change was:

“[t]he possible development of the territory on the border of Prague Benice
and Prague Uhiinéves boroughs, i.e. the creation of a new residential complex
surrounded by nature with the possibility of connecting it to commercial,
cultural and sporting facilities in Prague Uhiinéves and simultaneously within
reach of the Cestlice — Prihonice commercial zone.” *

  

72. The Districts’ proposals were included in “wave 6” of the various proposed
changes being considered for Prague’s land use plan. They were numbered as
change “Z 1294/06”, later renumbered as “Z 1294/07” (the “Zoning Plan Change
Z 1294/07” or simply the “Zoning Plan Change”).*° This marked the official start
of the long procurement and approval process for the proposed re-zoning.*°

The Outline

73. Asa first step, an Outline of the Zoning Plan Change was prepared by the Zoning
Plan Division of the Municipal Office of the City of Prague. The Outline*” was
made available for the review and comment of all interested Authorities and City
Districts, displayed for public viewing in the zoning plan processor’s office and
posted online.** Additionally, a public discussion of the Outline was scheduled for
28 February 2005.*?

74. Position statements were submitted by the Environmental Division of the
Municipal Office of the City of Prague on 17 March 2005, and by the Ministry of
Regional Development on 12 October 2005.*° The position statement of the
Ministry of Regional Development confirmed the compliance of the Outline with

75. On 23 February 2006, following the review of the Outline by the relevant City and
state authorities and the public, the Prague City Assembly approved the Outline for
the zoning plan change.”

The Concept

76. The second step of the process was to obtain approval for the Concept from the
Development Section and from the Environmental Division. A Concept was
elaborated and made available to the interested authorities, to the City Districts,
and for public comment, and was subsequently approved by the Development
Section on 24 April 2008.47 An environmental impact assessment was also
prepared and provided to the Environmental Division, which issued a positive
position statement on 7 May 2008.‘4

77. Based on these approvals, the Concept was submitted to the City Assembly, which
approved it by issuing an “affirmative opinion with conditions” in its resolution of
30 October 2008.45

78. Itis to be noted that this was the current stage of the Zoning Plan Change when
Claimants purchased the land constituting the Project Area — see infra section [4.].

The Draft

79. In the final stage of the procurement process, the Development Section of the
Municipal Office of Prague prepared the Draft of the zoning plan change in the
form of a zoning map, based on the Outline.*° At this point, several of the proposed
changes in “wave 6” were split out and reassigned into a “wave 07”, which
proceeded more quickly than the changes that remained in “wave 06.” Procedure
Z 1294/06 was moved to “wave 07” and was thereafter referred to as Z-1294/07.4”

80. The Draft went through two rounds of deliberations and was made available to the
relevant Authorities and to the public.** As part of the approval process, a joint
hearing was held on 15 May 2009, followed by a public hearing.”

81. The interested authorities — including the Environmental Division and the Ministry
of Regional Development — approved the Draft in the context of both hearings.°°

Since the reactions of the Authorities had been favorable, and no comments had

City Assembly.*!

2.3. APPROVAL OF ZONING PLAN CHANGE Z 1294/07

82. On 26 March 2010, Prague’s City Assembly approved the Zoning Plan Change Z
1294/07 relating to the Project Area (“Zoning Plan Change”) and implemented it
through a “Measure of General Nature” of the same date.°* The Zoning Plan
Change entered into force on 16 April 2010 — eight years after the Benice District
Assembly had first discussed and approved the proposal for the re-zoning of the
Project Area. But the approval was still subject to judicial review, which could lead
to the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change, at the request of any District or any
other affected party.*

3. MR. PAWLOWSKI’S INTRODUCTION TO THE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY IN
BENICE / UHRINEVES

 

83. In 2007 Mr. Pawlowski, who was actively looking for investment opportunities,
was introduced to the Mayor of Uhiinéves, Mr. Coller, and to his Deputy Mayor,
Mr. Langmajer. In the course of their discussions, Mr. Coller and Mr. Langmajer
informed Mr. Pawlowski of the ongoing efforts by the district of Uhiinéves to find
a developer to construct a residential project (the “Benice Residential Complex”,
or the “Project”) in the Project Area.>+

4. CLAIMANTS’ PURCHASE OF LA

 

84. Following these enquiries, Pawlowski AG acquired the shelf company Projekt
Sever s.r.o. in February 2007 for the purpose of realising the project.*> Projekt
Sever then hired a real estate lawyer, Dr. Robert Zugar, who began to work towards
concluding purchase agreements for the land in the Project Area.*° Projekt Sever
eventually concluded all of the relevant land purchases between June 2007 and
December 2008,*” at a time when the re-zoning was still underway (it would only
be approved two years later in 2010).

85. Projekt Sever acquired the Project Area from different owners. In particular, it
purchased land from private landowners [4.1], the City of Prague [4.2] and the
Czech Republic [4.3 and 4.4].

PROJEKT SEVER’S PURCHASE OF LAND FROM PRIVATE LANDOWNERS

As can be seen in the map above, the majority of the Project Area involved land
previously owned by private landowners (shaded in orange).

The re-zoning process had at this point been underway for five years, a Concept
had been approved by the City Assembly and Projekt Sever thus paid the
landowners a price, which as Mayor Coller acknowledged, was “... considerably
higher than it would have been for agricultural land.”°? Dr. Zugar, Claimants’
attorney for the land acquisitions, explains that:

“[t]he prices agreed with the private land owners reflected an average price
of CZK 1,250 per square meter, which was much higher than the price of
farming land in the same area at that time due to the fact that the zoning
process was in a very advanced stage.” °°

PROJEKT SEVER’S PURCHASE OF LAND FROM THE CITY OF PRAGUE

Claimants also sought to purchase certain plots of land located within the District
of Benice and owned by the City of Prague.®' Since June 2000, the Benice District

Assembly had delegated the administration of these plots to the neighboring
District of Uhifnéves, and Claimants therefore negotiated directly with officials
from Uhfinéves.

90. A tender was launched, and Projekt Sever was the only bidder. The Council and
the Assembly of Uhifnéves approved the sale of the land.** On 20 June 2007 Projekt
Sever and Prague 22 District signed a contract (the “Prague Purchase Contract”),
which described the asset as “arable land”; the buyer paid CZK 43,820,000 for the
43,784 m? of land owned by the City of Prague.

4.3, PURCHASE OF MILITARY OWNED LAND FROM THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE

91. In addition, Projekt Sever also purchased a small proportion of land (about 8% of
the total) from the Czech Republic’s Ministry of Defense, which owned several
small plots of land in the Project Area as well as old buildings that had once served
as housing for military personnel. They included structures such as workshops,
fencing, and outdoor lighting. By 1992, the military had mostly abandoned the
complex and returned much of the land beneath the buildings to private individuals,
but the buildings and related structures remained. As of 2007, the majority of the
former military owned buildings and fixtures were in a state of disrepair.

92. On 8 December 2008, Projekt Sever signed an agreement with the Ministry of
Defense (the “Defense Purchase Contract’). It paid CZK 10,854,281 to the
Ministry for 1,135 m’ of land, and for the right to tear down the structures and to
dispose of the rubble.’ The Defense Purchase Contract describes the object of the
sale as “structures” and “miscellaneous” and “unfertile” land.°*

4.4 OPTION TO PURCHASE LAND OWNED BY THE CZECH LAND FUND

93. Uhiinéves officials also offered to assist Projekt Sever with the purchase of a strip
of land which was owned by the Czech Land Fund: Projekt Sever agreed to a plan
whereby Uhiinéves would apply for a transfer of land to the District and the District
would in turn sell the land to Projekt Sever.”

94. Dealing with the Czech Land Fund land took longer than anticipated (due to a
restitution lawsuit which had been started against the Czech Land Fund for the

same plot of land). Ultimately, Projekt Sever entered into an agreement with the
prospective private owner, with an option to purchase the property, if the restitution
lawsuit was successful.”

The restitution suit ultimately was successful, but due to the eventual annulment of
the Zoning Plan Change, the purchase of this plot of land was never completed.”!

THE BENICE LAWSUIT

The Prague Purchase Contract had been entered into between Projekt Sever and
District 22 of the City of Prague. The land sold was located in the District of Benice,
but it was administered by the District of Uhiinéves. The distinction is relevant,
because the sales price paid by the buyer went to the District which administered
the land, not to that in which it was located.”

The District of Benice was not satisfied with this solution. In October 2009, Benice
filed a lawsuit with the District Court of Prague against Projekt Sever (not against
the District of Uhiinéves), contesting the validity of Projekt Sever’s purchase of
land under the Prague Purchase Contract (the “Benice Lawsuit”). Benice asserted
that its District, and not the District of Uhiinéves, should have represented the City
of Prague during the sale of the landand should have received the proceeds.”*

Once the Benice Lawsuit was filed, a lawyer representing the District of Benice
informed Mr. Pawlowski’s lawyer that Benice was willing to withdraw the lawsuit
if the Claimants paid the District CZK 20 million.” Mr. Pawlowski refused to make
the payment.’>

PERMITS OF THE PROJECT

In the Czech Republic, once a zoning plan is approved or changed, a developer
must obtain three permits for the construction and subsequent use of real estate.”
These are a planning permit, a building permit and a final inspection approval:””

-  Asafirst step, the developer must obtain a planning permit from the competent
building authority, which ensures that the project conforms to the zoning plan
and that the proposed construction complies with legal requirements, including
water, electricity, fire protection and other public health requirements;’*

- After obtaining the planning permit, a developer must secure a building permit,
which describes the layout and technical details of the planned construction;
once the developer has obtained the building permit, construction may start;

- Last, the completed construction requires inspection approval, which confirms
that the construction complies with the building permit; once the inspection
approval is granted, the buildings may be used for their planned purpose.*°

100. After purchasing the land in the summer of 2007,*! Project Sever hired the
architectural and engineering studio Tichy and Koldtova (“TaK”).*? An
architectural agreement was concluded on 23 December 2007** and immediately
thereafter, the planning activity began. It went on for almost four years. The formal
application for a planning permit was finally filed in January 2012 (i.e., two years
after the Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07 had been adopted by the City of Prague
Assembly).**

101. Projekt Sever and TaK had to take numerous steps in order to obtain preliminary
approvals from the relevant authorities. For example, Projekt Sever was obliged to
confirm that the residential complex could be connected to the municipal sewage
system. This involved discussions with local authorities, and ultimately led to the
solution that Projekt Sever would cooperate with another developer in the area,
constructing a new wastewater pumping station and pressure line, at their own
cost.85

102. Another extensive process was the preparation of the documentation related to the
environmental impact assessment for the project. For this, TaK had to obtain
statements from a number of authorities. TaK adapted the Project’s design to
incorporate the comments received from and the agreements reached with the
authorities.8° However, before the formal application for a planning permit could
be filed, an application for an increase in density was required.

7. APPLICATION FOR AN INCREASE IN DENSITY

103. As mentioned previously, on 16 April 2010, Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07 was
approved by the Prague Assembly and the Project Area was zoned as residential
land*’ within the category “OB-B”, i.e., residential use with a density coefficient

of 0.3. This implied that Projekt Sever could build approximately 100,000 m? of
apartments and houses on the site, subject to obtaining planning and building
permits. **

Proposal for an increase in the density coefficient

104. Six months later, on 19 January 2011, Projekt Sever submitted a proposal to
increase the density coefficient from 0.3 (““OB-B”) to 0.5 (“OB-C”)* — which was
the density coefficient that had originally been sought in the applications for the
zoning plan change submitted by Benice and Uhiinéves, but which had been
reduced to OB-B by the Prague City Assembly in its resolution approving Draft
Change Z 1294/07.”

105. The process for the increase of the density coefficient was simpler than for the
zoning plan change, since it qualified as an adjustment and not as a change.°!
Approvals were sought from the relevant authorities, including the Districts of
Benice and Uhiinéves, the Construction Department of Uhiinéves, the
Development Section of the Municipal Office of Prague, and the Environmental
Division.

106. The Construction Division of Prague 22 and the Deputy Mayor of Uhiinéves, Mr.
Martin Turnovsky, both approved the density increase.”>

 

107. Benice, however, opposed the density increase and on 7 March 2011 issued a
negative opinion, noting that it stood by its original statement on the project from
December 2008:

“Prague-Benice Borough stands by its original statement on the investment
project from December 2008. In the minutes of the consultation of the
borough’s comments on the zoning plan concept of 31.3.2009, it is stated that

a request for low-rise construction up to 3 levels above ground will be
accepted.”°*

108. Shortly thereafter, Benice’s Mayor Topicova informed Claimants’ lawyer that the
District could accept a density increase, but she requested a payment from Projekt
Sever as consideration for the District’s smooth cooperation.>

109. No such payment was made.

Approval of the increase in the density coefficient

110. The District of Benice ultimately waived its opposition and gave its approval to the
increase in the density coefficient. Mayor Topiéova has justified the change of
position, explaining that the District was threatened with losing access to
Uhiinéves’ kindergarten. Mayor Topiéové testified that Uhiinéves’ Deputy Mayor
Turnovsky met with her at Benice’s municipal office and threatened that, if Benice
withheld its consent to the change in the density coefficient, Uhiinéves’
kindergarten would turn away all the children from Benice.*®

111. Mr. Turnovsky rejected Ms. Topiéova’s presentation of the facts, maintaining that
he reached a mutual agreement with Ms. Topi¢ova so that both boroughs would
support the change in density, in order to secure the greatest possible involvement
of the investor, particularly for the creation of a new kindergarten.” Mr. Turnovsky
explained that the issue of a new kindergarten was important, precisely because
Uhiinéves would not have the capacity to admit the additional children of the
proposed new Residential Complex Benice.°* According to Mr. Turnovsky, the
discussion did not involve threats to turn away children from Benice from
Uhiinéves’ kindergarten; rather, Uhifnéves agreed to admit a specific maximum
number of children, regardless of the further evolution of the Project.”

112. Be that as it may, it is a fact that the District of Benice gave its consent, as did the
District of Uhiinéves, and that on 16 August 2011, the Zoning Plan Division of the
Municipal Office of Prague modified the zoning plan to reflect the increased
density coefficient of 0.5 (“OB-C”).!°°

8. APPLICATION FOR A PLANNING PERMIT

113. Six months later, on 3 January 2012, the Zoning Plan Department of the Municipal
Office of Prague confirmed that TaK’s design of the residential complex was in

line with the functional use permitted in the zoning plan.'°! Following this
confirmation, TaK filed the planning permit application and supporting
documentation for the Project with the building office of Uhiinéves,'”? anticipating
the construction of 796 apartments and houses on the Project Area.'°

114. On 30 January 2012, Claimants’ representative, Mr. Jaroslav Maléanek, sent a
written request for consent from Benice regarding the Project’s connections to gas
lines and to the sewer system on City land administered by Benice.'°* When no
response was received, Mr. Maléanek made an appointment with Mayor Topiéova
to discuss the matter in person. According to Claimants, there followed a number
of face-to-face meetings between their representatives and Mayor Topicova,
although she ultimately refused the request for consent and told Mr. Maléanek that
Mr. Pawlowski should meet with her in person.!°>

115. Although in her witness statement Mayor Topiéova denied having met with Mr.
Maléanek, !° during the Hearing she admitted that, in fact, she had met with Mr.
Maléanek with respect to the connection to the gas lines. '°”

116. Eventually, the Prague Property Records, Management and Use Division sent a
letter warning Benice that if it failed to issue the requested statement and failed to
follow the standard procedure for the planning permit process, the City, as
landowner, would respond to the request. Mayor Topigova also noted her irritation
that Claimants continued to negotiate with Prague 22 Borough, rather than with
Benice, even though the Project area was located on Benice’s cadastral area. !°

9. THE BENICE LAWSUIT IS DISMISSED

117. By early 2012, the development of the Project seemed to be proceeding as planned:
the zoning change had been approved, the increase in density had been accepted
and the planning permit application had been submitted by Claimants’ architects to
the relevant authorities.

118. At that time, the Benice Lawsuit, Benice’s judicial challenge against the Prague
Purchase Contract was still pending. On 8 March 2012, the District Court issued
its decision: it dismissed the Benice Lawsuit, with the result that the purchase price
paid by Projekt Sever would flow to Uhiinéves and that Benice would not be
entitled to receive any funding.'? In its decision, the Court considered that Benice
lacked standing to bring the case, because Municipal Districts cannot own property

and act only as managers of entrusted property.!!° Additionally, the Court rejected
the argument that Benice was in charge of the administration of the plots of land
and confirmed that Uhiinéves was the rightful administrator.!!!

119. Benice’s Mayor Topiéova promptly decided to appeal the decision.'!? On 29 May
2012, Projekt Sever sent a letter to Mayor Topiéova, objecting to the filing of the
appeal and protesting once again that Projekt Sever could not be held hostage in
the dispute between Benice and Uhiinéves.!!*

120. The appeal was eventually dismissed,''4 and Projekt Sever’s purchase of land
owned by the City of Prague under the Prague Purchase Contract became
unassailable.

10. | BENICE’S ANNULMENT REQUEST

121. The extent of the Residential Complex planned by Projekt Sever was causing
concern to neighbours who owned real estate in the proximity. In May 2012, two
neighbours, Mr. Hepner and Ms. Stépankova,''> contacted Mayor Topigova and
held a meeting with her and with Benice’s lawyer, Mr. Bernhard, to voice their
concern.'!® It was during this meeting that the possibility of a judicial request for
the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change was first discussed (the “Annulment
Request”).!!7

122. After obtaining the authorization of the Benice District Assembly, on 28 June 2012
the Annulment Request was filed with the Court. In this action, the City of Prague
(not Projekt Sever) was named as respondent, and the relief sought was the
annulment of the Zoning Plan Change, based on substantive and procedural
shortcomings. !!8

123. Projekt Sever was invited to take part in the proceedings through a notification sent
by the Municipal Court on 25 July 2012. However, by the time Projekt Sever
attempted to do so in March 2013, the deadline had already passed, and the Court

Decision of the Municipal Court

The City Court reviewed the case, and on 26 April 2013, it issued a long and fully
reasoned decision (the “Annulment Decision”),'?! finding that Zoning Plan
Change Z 1294/07 should be annulled, because:

- (i) it had been issued in contravention of the law; and
- (ii) it lacked proper reasoning.
Decision of the Prague Supreme Administrative Court

Initially, the Mayor of Prague, Mr. Toma’ Hudeéek, stated publicly that the city
“welcome[d] the Court’s judgment” and that the City of Prague would not file a
cassation complaint to the Prague Supreme Administrative Court.'?*

Contrary to Mr. Hudeéek’s remarks, the City of Prague did in fact file a cassation
complaint. '?> At the time, Mayor Hudeéek was quoted as saying that “lawyers had
convinced [him] that if Prague had not appealed, it could have harmed its position
in any arbitration.”!*4

The cassation complaint was dismissed by the Supreme Administrative Court one
year later, on 26 February 2014, thus confirming the annulment of the Zoning Plan
Change. !5

As a consequence of the cassation judgment, the Annulment Decision became res
judicata.

Projekt Sever’s unsuccessful appeals to the Constitutional Court

Projekt Sever filed two further actions before the Constitutional Court, in an effort
to undo the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change.'?°

In the first case, Projekt Sever challenged the decision of the Municipal Court,
denying Projekt Sever’s standing, due to its failure to appear by the deadline
established by the Court. On 4 December 2014 the Constitutional Court confirmed
the Municipal Court’s decision and dismissed the complaint.!7”

In the second, later, case, Projekt Sever challenged the merits of the Annulment
Decision itself. This case was likewise dismissed by the Constitutional Court on 21

under the Constitution and international treaties binding upon the Czech Republic
had not been breached. !78

DEVELOPMENTS AFTER THE ANNULMENT DECISION

The Annulment Decision had a devastating effect on the Project: the use of the land
reverted to the previous category (agriculture, forest, and recreation), making any
residential development impossible. Projekt Sever’s application for a planning
permit became moot.

It is not in dispute that the partial or total annulment of a zoning plan is a frequent
occurrence in the Czech Republic.!”? The Building Act has a specific provision,
Section 55(3), establishing the principles which a Municipal authority must follow
in such cases.'*° Claimants say that Section 55(3) required the Prague City
Assembly to take up the question of re-procurement without delay (11.1) — an
interpretation which was initially contested by the Municipality (11.2; 11.3 and
11.4). When Claimants’ interpretation was supported by the Ministry of Regional
Development (11.5), the City changed tack and in 2015 submitted the issue of re-
procurement to the City Assembly — which eventually decided not to start a new
zoning change procedure, leaving the Project Area with its original status of
agricultural and recreational land, on which residential development is impossible
(12).

These events will be explained in more detail in the following sub-sections.
CLAIMANTS’ LETTER TO MAYOR HUDECEK

Two months after the Supreme Court decision, Mr. Pawlowski (in the name of
Projekt Sever) sent a letter to Mayor Hudeéek, explaining that the annulment of the
Zoning Plan Change had caused massive damage to Projekt Sever (quantified at a
minimum of CZK 2.5 billion) and requesting that the matter be included on the
agenda of the next session of the City Assembly.'*!

The following month, Mayor Hudeéek reacted. By letter dated 19 May 2014, he
informed Projekt Sever that Section 55(3) did not apply to this case, and that the
only possible course of action was the filing of a new application for a zoning plan
change.!?

DISCUSSION AT THE CITY ASSEMBLY MEETING OF 29 May 2014

At the meeting of the Prague City Assembly on 29 May 2014 (10 days after Mayor
Hudeéek’s letter), Assembly member Dr. Blazek asked Mayor Hudeéek about the
delay in bringing the matter of the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change before
the Assembly, noting the potential exposure to damages that the City of Prague was
facing.'*? (Dr. BlaZek was an important figure in the “ODS” party, a rival and
opponent of Mayor Hudeéek’s “TOP09” party).'*+

Mayor Hudeéek responded by asserting that:

“[t]he error is not in the official procedure [of the zoning change]; the error is
that the Prague City Assembly ever approved it.”!*°

Mayor Hudeéek suggested that there had been improper conduct in obtaining the
Zoning Plan Change: the Zoning Plan Division initially had a negative opinion, and
undue pressure had been exerted upon it to change its opinion. He also told the
Assembly that files relating to the approval of the Zoning Plan Change had been
sent to the Police.'*° Mayor Hudeéek further insinuated that there had been
criminality involved in the re-zoning process. '*7

DISCUSSION AT THE CITY ASSEMBLY MEETING OF 19 JUNE 2014

One month later, at the 19 June 2014 City Assembly meeting, Dr. BlaZek once
again brought up the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change, proposing that the City
restart the re-procurement process, and noting the potential future risks that the City
Assembly members could face if they did not act. Dr. Blazek proposed placing the
matter on the agenda. '**

In response to Dr. Blazek’s concerns, Mayor Hudeéek replied that:

“Tf part of a zoning plan is annulled and there is no valid zoning plan in the
given part of the city or territory, the assembly has to act without delay. That
means that we have here the opinion of lawyers from the zoning plan division
headed by Mrs. Engineer Cvetlerova. Based on this opinion I think that we
really don’t have to deal with this situation now and q ly I won’t
submit the prints either. I consequently will not second Doctor Blaezek’s
motion.”!” [Emphasis added].

 

Mayor Hudeéek thus refused Dr. BlaZek’s motion to place the matter on the agenda
for discussion.

DISCUSSION AT THE CITY ASSEMBLY MEETING OF 11 SEPTEMBER 2014

Three months later, at the 11 September 2014 meeting of the City Assembly, Dr.
Blazek accused Mayor Hudeéek of being driven by personal animosity against Mr.
Pawlowski, stating:

“Perhaps I even understand that you don’t like Mr Pawlowski. Personal

feelings are a fundamental driving force of your actions, but that’s all right.
You will happily play it down in six months’ time [...]”""°

In reply, Mayor Hudeéek noted that the land in question belonged to Mr.
Pawlowski, and he alleged that Mr. Pawlowski was trying to force the Assembly
to take up the issue of the re-zoning. Mayor Hudeéek then once again urged the
Assembly members not to give in to pressure from Mr. Pawlowski, suggesting that
all of Prague was against the Zoning Plan Change and questioning Dr. Blazek’s
motivations for raising the issue. '4!

OPINION OF THE MINISTRY OF REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT

In the meantime, Mayor Coller of Uhiinéves had approached the Ministry of
Regional Development for a legal opinion regarding the annulment of the Zoning
Plan Change. The Ministry reacted on 27 October 2014, with a letter addressed to
Mayor Coller, in which it explained the Ministry’s position.'*? The interpretation
given by the Ministry to existing Czech legislation was that, upon annulment of a
zoning plan change, the matter must be submitted to the relevant Municipal
Assembly, which was obliged to assess the situation and to adopt a reasoned
decision

- to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change (which would require amending
the shortcomings established in the annulment judgement) or

- to confirm the annulment, in which case the previous zoning rules would
143
apply.

THE City ASSEMBLY TERMINATES THE RE-PROCUREMENT

 

Mayor Hudeéek’s mandate ended in November 2014. Thereafter, at some
unspecified time, the City of Prague decided to change tack. The City abandoned
the position that no new discussion in the Assembly was required and accepted the
Ministry’s interpretation of the Building Law, namely: if a zoning plan change is
annulled by the Courts, the Municipal Assembly is bound to assess the annulment
(i.e. to re-procure the file), and to adopt a reasoned decision either remedying the

shortcomings found by the Courts or finding that the post-annulment situation is
satisfactory.

By this time, Deputy Mayor Matéj Stropnicky of the Green Party had assumed
responsibility for spatial planning issues in Prague. As a first step, he put the
annulment of the Zoning Plan Change on the agenda of the Committee on Spatial
Development meeting to be held on 15 February 2015. Subsequently, the City
Council discussed the issue at its 31 March 2015 meeting and instructed Deputy
Mayor Stropnicky to submit the matter to the Assembly, with the recommendation
that the procurement of Change Z 1294/07 be terminated (i.e. that the procurement
should not be reinitiated, to correct the shortcomings found by the Court).'*+

Decision of the Assembly

The annulment of Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07 was placed on the agenda for the
Prague City Assembly meeting of 14 April 2015.

At this meeting, Deputy Mayor Stropnicky proposed the termination of the
procurement of Change Z 1294/07.'*° Mayor Krnaéova then called for a vote from
the City Assembly members. '4°

51 members voted in favor of the motion to terminate, and none abstained or voted
against it.!47

Thus, on 14 April 2015 — 13 years after the initial idea for the re-zoning, five years
after the Zoning Plan Change had been approved and 14 months after the Supreme
Court’s Annulment Decision — the Prague City Assembly terminated the
procurement of the re-zoning of the Project Area. Thus, the land purchased by
Projekt Sever to develop the Benice Residential Complex reverted to its original
use as agricultural, forest and recreational land.

LEGAL REMEDIES

The Parties have debated the legal remedies that Claimants could theoretically have
pursued in order to resolve the situation. As summarized below, Respondent says
that Claimants did not make use of all of the potential remedies available to them
by law, including their ability to re-initiate the procurement for the zoning change
or their ability to challenge the City Assembly’s resolution itself. Claimants
considered both alternatives to be futile.

Clai ” ability to re-initiate the procurement of the zoning change

According to Respondent’s expert, Projekt Sever, as an owner of the plots affected
by the Zoning Plan Change to the Prague land use plan, had the right to submit a
proposal under the 2006 Building Act to procure a change to the Prague land use
plan either on its own or by petitioning the District Assembly. Respondent’s expert
acknowledges, however, that the Prague City Assembly was not bound to accept
such proposals. '**

Claimants’ expert, on the other hand, explains that although it is true that, following
the Prague City Assembly’s vote to terminate the procurement, Claimants could,
in theory, have applied for a new zoning change, but they were not obliged to do
so.'4? Claimants’ expert explains that since neither Benice, nor the Prague City
Assembly supported the zoning plan change following its annulment, an
application by the Claimants would have had no chance of success. '°° Rather, it
was the Prague planning authorities, who were obliged to promote the re-
procurement, preparing a better substantiation in order to remedy the deficits
identified by the Courts. !>!

Claimants’ ability to challenge the Assembly’s resolution

With respect to the Claimants’ ability to challenge the Assembly’s Resolution of
14 April 2015, which terminated the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change,
Respondent’s expert explained that if Projekt Sever considered this resolution to
be an illegal interference with its rights, it could hypothetically have brought an
action before the administrative courts of the Czech Republic. However,
Respondent’s expert also noted that because (in his view) Projekt Sever is not
vested with any public subjective right that could have been curtailed, a challenge
of the resolution of the Prague Assembly would not have been likely to succeed. !*?

Claimants’ expert agreed that there would have been little to no chance of success
in challenging the City Assembly’s resolution.'>* Furthermore, Claimants’ expert
noted that, based on the Administrative Procedure Act, the Claimants would only
have been able to submit a request, which would not actually bind the Ministry of
the Interior to take action or to set the resolution of the Prague City Assembly
aside.'*

IV. REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

Claimants’ request for relief
158. In their Memorial, Claimants submitted the following request for relief:

“For the reasons set out in this Memorial, Claimants respectfully request that
the Arbitral Tribunal grant the following relief:

1. Declare that the Czech Republic’s actions and omissions at issue, including
those of its instrumentalities for which it is internationally responsible,
violated Articles 3 and 4 of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between
Switzerland and the Czech Republic by failing to grant the necessary permits
in connection with such investments, by failing to treat Claimants’
investments fairly and equitably and by impairing Claimants’ investments
through unreasonable and discriminatory measures;

2. Declare that the Czech Republic’s actions and omissions at issue, including
those of its instrumentalities for which it is internationally responsible,
constitute an indirect expropriation without prompt, adequate and effective
compensation in violation of Article 6 of the Bilateral Investment Treaty
between Switzerland and the Czech Republic;

3. Award compensation to Claimants, including pre-award interest as of July
31, 2020, in the amount of 4,950,382,717 Czech Crowns (CZK);

4, Award Claimants’ all costs associated with these proceedings, including
the costs and expenses of ICSID and of the arbitrators as well as fees and
disbursements for Claimants’ attorneys and experts;

5. Award post-award interest on all sums awarded from the date of the award
until Respondent pays the award and all accrued interest in full, at the repo
rate set by the Czech National Bank for the first day of the calendar half-year
in which the default occurs plus eight percentage points (8%); and

6. Any further relief that the Arbitral Tribunal deems appropriate in the
circumstances.”!°*

159. In their Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections,
Claimants slightly amended their Request for relief:

“For the reasons set out in this Memorial, Claimants respectfully request that
the Arbitral Tribunal grant the following relief:

Respondent’s request for relief

161. In its Counter-Memorial, the Czech Republic submitted several jurisdictional

objections and requested that the Tribunal:

156 CII, p. 2.

“. DECLARE that it has no jurisdiction over Claimant 1;
- DECLARE that it has no jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims;

- In the alternative, DECLARE that the Czech Republic has not breached the
Treaty and DISMISS all of Claimants’ claims in their entirety;

- In the further alternative, DECLARE that the damages Claimants claim are
not due; and

157 C-IIL, pp. 2-3.

- In any event, ORDER Claimants to fully reimburse the Czech Republic for
the costs it has incurred in defending its interests in this arbitration (plus
interest).”1°8

162. In its Rejoinder, the Czech Republic slightly amended its request for relief:

“For the foregoing reasons, the Czech Republic respectfully requests that the
Tribunal:

- DECLARE that it has no jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims;
- DECLARE that it has no jurisdiction over Claimant 1;

- In the alternative, DECLARE that the Czech Republic has not breached the
Treaty and DISMISS all of Claimants’ claims in their entirety;

- In the further alternative, DECLARE that the damages Claimants claim are
not due;

- In the even further alternative, DECLARE that the damages Claimants claim
should be limited to their sunk costs, quantified at CZK 28.9 million; and

- In any event, ORDER Claimants to fully reimburse the Czech Republic for
the costs it has incurred in defending its interests in this arbitration (plus
interest).”!°°

163. In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Czech Republic submitted a request for relief
identical to that formulated in its Rejoinder.!°

V. APPLICABLE LAW

164. The dispute arises under the Agreement between the Czech and Slovak Federal
Republic and the Swiss Confederation on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection
of Investments signed on October 5, 1990, which entered into force on August 7,
1991 (the BIT), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October
14, 1966 (the ICSID Convention).

165. The BIT is silent on the applicable law. However, Article 42(1) of the ICSID
Convention establishes the following:

“The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as
may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal
shall apply the law of the Contracting state party to the dispute (including its
rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be
applicable.”

166. Thus, the Tribunal must apply the BIT, the law of Czech Republic and the rules of
international law.

46

VI. JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS

167. Respondent submits that Claimants’ claims and investments fall outside the
jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal, for the following
reasons:

- Pawlowski AG does not qualify as a protected investor under Article 1(1)(b) or
under Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT [Jurisdiction “Ratione Personae’’] [V1.1];

- Both Pawlowski AG and Projekt Sever have failed to establish that their alleged
investments are protected under the BIT and the ICSID Convention
[Jurisdiction “Ratione Materiae”] [V1.2].

168. Respondent additionally argues that Claimants’ claims are inadmissible, because
they are purely domestic claims and because Claimants have not clarified which
acts or omissions, if proven, could constitute a breach of the BIT [Domestic
Law Objection] [V1.3].

169. Claimants disagree. They insist that the Tribunal has jurisdiction for the following
reasons:

- Both Pawlowski AG and Projekt Sever qualify as protected investors under
Article 1(1) of the BIT;

- Pawlowski AG and Projekt Sever made investments that qualify for protection
under the BIT; and

= Both Claimants have fulfilled all other obligations required under the BIT and
the ICSID Convention.

170. Furthermore, Claimants reject the Respondent’s objection to admissibility and aver
that their claims are for violations of the BIT.

VI.1. JURISDICTION RATIONE PERSONAE

In the following sections, the Tribunal will summarize Respondent’s ratione
personae objection to jurisdiction [1.], followed by Claimants’ position [2.], and
finally make its decision [3.].

POSITION OF RESPONDENT.

Respondent argues that the Tribunal must decline jurisdiction ratione personae
over Claimant 1 (Pawlowski AG), because Pawlowski AG does not qualify as a
protected investor under Article 1(1) of the BIT.'*! Respondent does not raise
objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae over Claimant 2 (Projekt
Sever).

According to Respondent, Pawlowski AG does not qualify as a protected investor
under Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, because it has neither real economic activities,
nor its seat, in Switzerland [1.1],'© and it is not protected under Article 1(1)(c),
because an investor that fails to qualify under Article 1(1)(b) cannot requalify as a
protected investor under Article 1(1)(c) [1.2].!°

PAWLOWSKI AG IS NOT A PROTECTED INVESTOR UNDER ARTICLE 1(1)(B)

According to Respondent, Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT requires a protected investor
to demonstrate that it has “real economic activities” in Switzerland [A.] and that it
has its “seat” in Switzerland [B.].'*

Pawlowski AG does not carry out “real economic activities” in Switzerland

Respondent argues that Pawlowski AG is an “investment holding company”,!°

that does not carry out real economic activities, and that it is only Pawlowski AG’s
subsidiaries that carry out such activities.'

Respondent refers to a “‘seven-prong” test, set forth by the Alps Finance tribunal,
to assess whether an investor meets the requirements of “real economic
activities.”'©7 It is the Respondent’s view that Pawlowski AG cannot satisfy this
test.

Respondent argues that Claimant | relies not on its own economic activities, but
on the activities of an entirely different company, Dmura AG, for the alleged
economic activities of Pawlowski AG.!©*

Claimants have not established a Swiss “seat” for Pawlowski AG

With respect to the company’s “seat”, Respondent argues that a company’s “seat”
must be interpreted as the effective place of management and administration of its
business operations. Respondent notes that this was the definition adopted by the
Alps Finance tribunal — which is the only other tribunal to have been constituted
under the BIT and called upon to apply Article 1(1)(c).!°

According to Respondent, Mr. Pawlowski was unable to identify a “given Swiss
place” from which the company was managed and administered.'”” Respondent
notes that Mr. Pawlowski identified the seat of another company, Dmura AG,
which is located in Zuoz, Switzerland, as the place where he usually works.
Additionally, Respondent notes that Pawlowski AG has its registered offices in the
care of an investment fund, Quadris AG, which is where Pawlowski AG has its
registered place of business as well as available office space.'7!

PAWLOWSKI AG IS NOT A PROTECTED INVESTOR UNDER ARTICLE 1(1)(C)

Respondent argues that Article 1(1)(c) is not intended to cover companies, which,
while registered in Switzerland, fail to pass the test of Article 1(1)(b).'’? Thus,
according to Respondent, because Pawlowski AG is not a protected investor under
Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, it cannot requalify as an investor under Article

1D."

Respondent argues that Article 1(1)(c) cannot be read in isolation, because such a
reading would render meaningless the restrictions of Article 1(1)(b) in
contravention of the principle of effet utile.'7* Respondent notes the Alps Finance
finding that Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT is a “special and uncommon clause”,
included specifically “to exclude from treaty protection ‘mailbox’ or ‘paper’
companies.” According to Respondent, Pawlowski AG is such a company.!”>

Additionally, according to Respondent, Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT only covers two
types of companies:

those which are Czech-registered but ultimately Swiss-controlled, and

those which are registered in any country outside of the two Contracting Parties,
yet are ultimately Swiss-controlled (Respondent notes that the reverse would be
true in the case of a claim brought against Switzerland).!7°

Since Pawlowski AG is neither Czech-registered but ultimately Swiss-controlled,
nor registered in a third country but Swiss-controlled, it cannot be considered an
investor under Article 1(1)(c).!””

POSITION OF CLAIMANTS

Claimants reject Respondent’s ratione personae jurisdiction objections. They
assert that both Pawlowski AG and Projekt Sever qualify as protected investors
under Article 1(1) of the BIT.'7*

It is common ground between the Parties that Projekt Sever is a protected investor
under Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT.'’? With respect to Pawlowski AG, Claimants
argue that it qualifies as a protected investor under Article 1(1)(b) [2.1] as well as
under Article 1(1)(c) [2.2] of the BIT.!*°

PAWLOWSKI AG QUALIFIES AS A PROTECTED INVESTOR UNDER ARTICLE
1()@)

Claimants explain that for Pawlowski AG to qualify as a protected investor under
the provisions of Article 1(1)(b), it must show that it is established in Switzerland
and demonstrate that it has [A.] real economic activities in Switzerland and [B.] its
seat located in Switzerland. Claimants note that Pawlowski AG’s establishment
under the laws of Switzerland is undisputed.'*!

 

Pawlowski AG carries out “real economic acti s” in Switzerland

Claimants assert that Pawlowski AG does carry out real economic activities in
Switzerland, noting Pawlowski AG’s ownership and administration of its
participation in a number of businesses in Switzerland.

Claimants accuse Respondent of misrepresenting the findings of the Alps Finance
case to the extent that they seek falsely to imply that the “seven-prong test” set
forth in Alps Finance is a cumulative test rather than a series of discrete examples,
and by ignoring the distinction between “brass plate” companies that carry out their
operations in other countries and corporations with an effective seat of management

in the host country.'*? Thus, argue Claimants, fulfilling just one of the Alps Finance
criteria would be sufficient to prove real economic activities in the host state.'**

Claimants argue that the Tribunal should consider the nature and activities of
Pawlowski AG in the round. Claimants explain that Pawlowski AG acts as an
investment holding company, and thus does not have direct operational
responsibilities and does not require large offices and staff — but that this does not
mean that Pawlowski AG is not engaged in real economic activities in
Switzerland.'**

Claimants note that it is in the nature of holding companies to conduct business
through their subsidiaries. Claimants also note that Respondent does not refute that
Dmura AG is Pawlowski AG’s subsidiary, or that Pawlowski AG is a substantial
shareholder of Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz. According to Claimants, Pawlowski AG
brings benefit to the Swiss economy through its daughter company and through its
holding in Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz.!*°

Claimants explain that Pawlowski AG has more than a modest turnover, pays
substantial fees for various legal and bookkeeping services, and has handled
payments and contributions via its Swiss bank accounts, including the payment of
remuneration to former board members. '*°

Claimants additionally note that accepting Respondent’s interpretation would lead
to the untenable result of excluding holding companies from the BIT’s protection
entirely, and that this result would contradict both the purpose of the BIT as well
as jurisprudence and doctrine.!®”

Pawlowski AG has its “seat” in Switzerland

According to Claimants, the Swiss statutory seat of Pawlowski AG is sufficient to
fulfill the BIT’ s requirement of a seat in Switzerland. '** Claimants refer to case law
for the proposition that a company’s seat shall be interpreted by way of renvoi to
municipal law.'*? Claimants assert that, pursuant to Article 56 of the Swiss Civil
Code, the seat of a legal entity is located where its administration is carried out,
unless its articles of association provide otherwise. !*°

194. Claimants explain that Pawlowski AG’s articles of association name Zug,

Private International Law Act, the seat of a company is the place specified in the
articles of association or the partnership agreement.'” Finally, Claimants note that
the Zug Commercial Registry lists Zug as the seat of Pawlowski AG.'*

195. Claimants argue that Respondent's interpretation of the BIT is wrong.

196. Claimants note that Respondent relies upon the Wirtgen tribunal in support of the
proposition that the definitions contained in Article 1 are meant to be autonomous
and treaty-specific, and hence, according to Respondent, “seat” should be read in
accordance with international law rather than Swiss law.!°4 However, according to
Claimants, the Wirtgen position is not that a term such as “seat” should be
interpreted in accordance with international law; rather, the Wirtgen tribunal
explained that when it appears that the contracting parties did not wish to give a
term a particular meaning which it may have in national law, then a treaty term
may be interpreted independently from the national law of the parties. Claimants
assert that in the present case there is no indication that the Contracting Parties did
not wish tribunals to consider national law in interpreting the BITs terms.'**

197. Claimants note that, as a practical matter, it does not make a difference whether the
Tribunal accepts Claimants’ or Respondent’s arguments regarding the
interpretation of the term “seat” in the BIT. According to Claimants, even if
Respondent’s interpretation of “seat” (meaning the effective place of management
and administration of a company) were correct (quod non), Claimants have
submitted evidence sufficient to demonstrate that Pawlowski AG is effectively
managed and administered in Zug and Zuoz, Switzerland, notably that:!°°

= The general meetings of shareholders are held in Switzerland;
- Corporate and accounting records are maintained in Switzerland;

- All administrative services, including bookkeeping and accounting, have been
provided in Switzerland;

- At all material times, an active bank account has been maintained, and is still
maintained, in Switzerland;

= The office in Zug is the only office worldwide, with substantive administrative
work being done in Zuoz; and

PAWLOWSKI AG ALSO QUALIFIES AS AN INVESTOR UNDER ARTICLE 1(1)(C)

Claimants argue that, regardless of the Tribunal’s interpretation of Article 1(1)(b)
of the BIT, Pawlowski AG separately and independently qualifies as an investor
under the BIT under Article 1(1)(c), because Pawlowski AG is 100% owned and
controlled by a Swiss national, Mr. Sebastian Pawlowski.!*”

Claimants explain that Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT applies to two types of potential
investors:

legal entities that are controlled by Swiss nationals, and

legal entities that are controlled by Swiss entities that also have real
economic activities in Switzerland.'°*

According to Claimants, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Pawlowski AG in the
present case by virtue of Mr. Pawlowski’s citizenship as a Swiss national and his
ultimate control of Pawlowski AG.!°?

Claimants reject Respondent’s argument that Article 1(1)(c) only applies to Swiss-
controlled companies registered either in the Czech Republic or in any country
other than Switzerland or the Czech Republic. According to Claimants, this
argument goes against the terms of the BIT, particularly since the text of Article
1(1)(c) states that it applies to “legal entities established under the law of any
country.”20°

Claimants additionally reject Respondent’s argument that granting jurisdiction
under Article 1(1)(c) would be in contravention of the principle of effet utile.
According to Claimants, the principle of effet utile aims to make the object and
purpose of the BIT possible or effectuated through interpretation. Claimants
explain that the object and purpose of the BIT is, inter alia, to “create and maintain
favourable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the
territory of the other Contracting Party.” Thus, in order to qualify as an “investor
of one Contracting Party”, Pawlowski AG is required to show a sufficient link to
Switzerland. According to Claimants, by including both Article 1(1)(b) and Article
1(1)(c) in the BIT, it follows that the Contracting Parties deemed these to be
different links, satisfaction of either one of which is sufficient to secure
qualification as a protected investor.?°!

Thus, according to Claimants, Pawlowski AG qualifies as an investor either if it

1(1)(b))

- or alternatively, if, in conformity with Article 1(1)(c), it is controlled by a Swiss
national (under Article 1(2)(c)).

Claimants’ position is that Pawlowski AG has demonstrated sufficient links to
Switzerland to satisfy the conditions to qualify as an investor under both possible
avenues?

3. DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

203. According to Respondent, Pawlowski AG does not fulfil the requirements under
Article 1(1) of the BIT and therefore does not qualify as a protected investor under
the BIT. Specifically, Respondent asserts that:

- Pawlowski AG does not qualify under Article 1(1)(b), because it has not
established that it has real economic activities and its “seat” in Switzerland; and

- Pawlowski AG cannot requalify under Article 1(1)(c), because this clause is not
intended to apply to investors who otherwise fail to meet the requirements under
Article 1(1)(b).

204. According to Claimants, Pawlowski AG qualifies as a protected investor under
Article 1(1)(b) and, separately, under Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT.?°

205. The Tribunal notes that there is no dispute between the Parties with respect to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Projekt Sever. For the sake of completeness, the
Tribunal will quickly go over the facts pertinent to its jurisdiction ratione personae
over Projekt Sever.

206. Claimants have shown that:

- Projekt Sever is a company established in 2007 under the laws of the Czech
Republic, registered with the Municipal Court in Prague under Company ID No.
278 61 5037;

- 100% of the shares of Projekt Sever have been held by Pawlowski AG at all

times relevant to this dispute”; and

Pawlowski AG is a Swiss established company” fully owned and controlled by
Mr. Pawlowski — himself a Swiss Citizen.?°”

Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT provides protection to investors, who are defined as:

“Jegal entities established under the law of any country which are, directly or
indirectly, controlled by nationals of that Contracting Party or by legal entities
having their seat, together with real economic activities, in the territory of that
Contracting Party.”

Projekt Sever is a legal entity established under the law of the Czech Republic.
Projekt Sever also fulfills the additional requirements for protection under Article
1(1)(c): it is a legal entity which is (i) controlled directly by the Swiss company
Pawlowski AG through its 100% share ownership, and (ii) controlled indirectly by
Mr. Pawlowski, who is a national of Switzerland.

Thus, the Tribunal determines that it has jurisdiction ratione personae over Projekt
Sever.

The Tribunal will now turn to Respondent’s objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
ratione personae over Pawlowski AG. The Tribunal will begin by establishing the
facts [A.] and will then explain why it dismisses Respondent’s objection [B.].

A. Proven facts

As previously noted, Pawlowski AG is fully owned and controlled by Mr.
Sebastian Pawlowski, who is a Swiss citizen.?

Pawlowski AG is a company which was incorporated under the laws of Switzerland
on 20 September 1996.°° Pawlowski AG’s Articles of Association establish that
its seat is in Zug and that:

“The purpose of the company is to acquire and manage all types of
investments in domestic and foreign companies.

The company may acquire, hold and dispose of real estate and engage in all
commercial, financial and other activities related to the purpose of the
company.”?!°
Pawlowski AG’s activities are consistent with the above. It acts primarily as a
holding company, which, through its subsidiaries, owns and controls investments
in Switzerland and abroad, inter alia:

- Besides its ownership and control of Projekt Sever, Pawlowski AG also owns
100% of the shares of the Swiss company Dmura AG;7!!

- Dmura AG, in turn, runs the Swiss hotels Parkhiitte Varusch,?!? Hotel
Engiadina,?"* and Hotel Crusch Alva,?" all of which employ significant numbers
of personnel;7!>

- Dmura AG is also active in the real estate business in Switzerland, having
engaged in the construction and sale of apartment buildings, especially in the
Canton of Graubiinden;?!°

- Pawlowski AG has also directly invested in the Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz, a well-
known Swiss international boarding school, where Mr. Pawlowski serves as the
chairman of the board of directors.”!”

B. Discussion
214. Article 1(1) of the BIT explains that:
“(1) In the case of either Contracting Party, the term “investor” refers to:

(a) natural persons who are nationals of that Contracting Party in accordance
with its laws;

(b) legal entities, includin, ies, corporations, business association

and other organisations, which are constituted or otherwise duly organized
under the law of that Contracting Party and have their seat, together with real
economic activities, in the territory of the same Contracting Party:

(c) legal entities established under the law of any country which are, directly
or indirectly, controlled by nationals of that Contracting Party or by legal

entities having their seat, together with real economic activities, in_the
territory of that Contracting Party.” [Emphasis added]

215. Respondent argues that Pawlowski AG cannot qualify as an investor under Article
1(1)(c) of the BIT, because this provision is not intended to extend to companies
registered in Switzerland which fail to pass the test of Article 1(1)(b).?!*

216. The Tribunal does not agree.
217. Under the rules of interpretation set forth in Article 31 of the VCLT:

“A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light
of its object and purpose.”?!”

218. The Tribunal does not see any language in the text of Article 1(1) of the BIT which
suggests that a failure to qualify under one clause would prohibit qualification
under the other. Thus, the Tribunal finds that Pawlowski AG may qualify as a
protected investor under Article 1(1)(c) independently of the requirements of
Article 1(1)(b).

Article 1. )(c

219. Two elements are required for Pawlowski AG to qualify as a protected investor
under Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT:

- First, it must be a legal entity established under the law of Switzerland; and

- Second, it must be controlled, directly or indirectly, by: (i) nationals of
Switzerland, or (ii) legal entities which are seated and have real economic
activities in Switzerland.

220. It has already been shown that Pawlowski AG was incorporated under the laws of
Switzerland in 1996,” satisfying the first requirement.

221. It has also been established that Pawlowski AG is fully owned and controlled by a
Swiss national, Mr. Sebastian Pawlowski,”?! meeting the second requirement.

222. Consequently, the Tribunal determines that it has jurisdiction ratione personae
with respect to Pawlowski AG under Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT.

VI.2. JURISDICTION RATIONE MATERIAE

Claimants submit that they made investments under the BIT and the ICSID
Convention by undertaking several interrelated economic activities which lead to
the implementation of a project. In particular:

Pawlowski AG invested in all the shares and capital of Projekt Sever;

Projekt Sever, in turn, invested in 276,134 m? of real property in Prague in order
to construct the Project; and

Projekt Sever also invested capital in the planning process of the Project.

In the following sections the Tribunal will summarize Respondent’s ratione
materiae objection to jurisdiction [1.], followed by Claimants’ position [2.], and
finally make its decision [3.].

POSITION OF RESPONDENT.

Respondent argues that, under the BIT and under Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention, a protected investment involves contribution, duration and risk.
According to Respondent, the Claimants’ submissions focused solely on the
criterion of contribution and they have thus failed to prove that their investments
meet all of these criteria.””? Respondent presents ratione materiae objections to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the investments of both Pawlowski AG (Claimant 1)
[1.1] and Projekt Sever (Claimant 2) [1.2].

PAWLOWSKI AG’S SHAREHOLDING IS NOT A PROTECTED INVESTMENT

Respondent notes that Pawlowski AG’s investment consists solely of its shares in,
and payment for those shares to, Projekt Sever. Respondent argues that this
shareholding is insufficient to qualify as a protected investment, because Claimants
paid only an admittedly nominal price of CZK 200,000 for the shares in Projekt
Sever.?”> According to Respondent, the payment of a purely nominal price for
shares puts in doubt the existence of a contribution and, in turn, that of a protected
investment.?** Furthermore, Respondent argues that Pawlowski AG cannot
possibly hold a protected investment, since it only holds shares in Projekt Sever,
which itself does not hold a protected investment.??>

1.2. PROJEKT SEVER’S ALLEGED INVESTMENTS ARE NOT PROTECTED

228. According to Respondent, none of the three components of Projekt Sever’s alleged
investment is protected, namely:

= the purchase of land;

= the capital spent on the planning process; or

- the expectation that the Project would finally be implemented.?7°

229. Respondent argues that Projekt Sever’s purchase of land is a one-off commercial
transaction, devoid of any risk and duration, which thus does not fulfil the inherent
criteria of a protected investment.??’ Respondent also argues that, because the
Claimants’ project never materialised, any pre-investment expenditures or capital
spent on the planning process cannot form a part of a protected investment.?*
Finally, Respondent argues that Claimants have failed to prove that Projekt Sever’s
investment can consist of the expectation that the Project would finally be
implemented — an impossible task, since such expectation does not fulfil the criteria
of contribution, duration and risk.22°

2. POSITION OF CLAIMANTS

230. Claimants dismiss Respondent’s objections with respect to both Pawlowski AG
and Projekt Sever. As a preliminary matter, Claimants note that Respondent does
not contest that Pawlowski AG’s investments (its purchase of the shares in Projekt
Sever, its capital contributions to Projekt Sever, Projekt Sever’s purchase of the
real estate at issue, and the costs incurred by Projekt Sever in connection with the
planning and development of Residential Complex Benice) would not have come
about but for Claimants’ decision to develop and dedicate Projekt Sever’s resources
to the Project. According to Claimants, this by itself is sufficient to establish the
existence of a protected investment.?*”

231. Claimants have presented submissions arguing that both Pawlowski AG [2.1] and
Projekt Sever [2.2] made protected investments as defined in Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention and in the BIT.”*!

2.1 PAWLOWSKI AG MADE PROTECTED INVESTMENTS

232. Claimants note that it is not in dispute that Pawlowski AG purchased 100% of the
shares of Projekt Sever for CZK 200,000.?*? According to Claimants, this alone
qualifies as an investment by Pawlowski AG under Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT,
regardless of the amount paid for such shares.?** Claimants note that Pawlowski
AG also made additional capital contributions and loans to Projekt Sever totaling
CZK 649,027,000 as of 31 December 2018.7**

233. Claimants assert that Pawlowski AG acquired Projekt Sever as a shelf company
and made loans and capital contributions to it for the sole purpose of constructing
the Project in Prague.”** Additionally, Claimants argue that the elements of
duration and risk faced by Projekt Sever also apply to Pawlowski AG’s investments
in Projekt Sever.?*

2.2 PROJEKT SEVER MADE PROTECTED INVESTMENTS

234. Claimants assert that Projekt Sever’s purchases of real estate for the development
of a residential housing project (at prices for residential land) were investments in
a long-term economic activity and not one-off commercial transactions.?*”
According to Claimants, it would require years of effort and substantial costs after
the land purchases to realise a return on these investments, such that Projekt Sever
was subject to the inherent risks of such development projects.?°*

235. Additionally, Claimants argue that the costs incurred by Projekt Sever in the course
of designing and planning the project, including costs incurred pursuant to binding
contracts, also qualify as investments.?*? According to Claimants, such costs are
not “pre-investment expenditures”, as such a term could only be applied to the costs
incurred in connection with Claimants’ due diligence efforts prior to deciding to
purchase land for the Project. Thus, in the Claimants view, all costs incurred from
the moment of the first land purchase were investments in a development project
that commenced with that land purchase.”4?

DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

The Tribunal must determine whether the investments made by Claimants qualify
as “protected investments” under the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention.

Claimants rely on the following investments:

Pawlowski AG’s invested CZK 200,000.00 in purchasing its 100% shareholding
in Projekt Sever;

Pawlowski AG made capital contributions and loans to Projekt Sever for the
purpose of purchasing the land for development of the Project;

Projekt Sever invested CZK 343,693,031.00 in its purchase of 276,134 m? of real
estate in Prague;7*! and

Projekt Sever invested additional capital in the planning and designing of the
Project.

A. Proven facts

Claimants have provided evidence that Pawlowski AG paid CZK 200,000 for its
100% share ownership of Projekt Sever.

The contract concerning the assignment of Projekt Sever’s shares declares that:747
“The seller paid his contribution of CZK 200,000,- to the company’s nominal

capital in full. His share, which is determined by the ratio of his
contribution to the company’s nominal capital, is 100%.

[...]
The seller assigns its entire share in the above-mentioned Company,

corresponding to a contribution of CZK 200,000,-, to the Buyer [identified as
Pawlowski AG].

[od

The seller assigns its company share at a price of CZK 200,000,- (in words:
two hundred thousand Czech crowns).”

The extract from the Commercial Register of the Municipal Court in Prague lists
Pawlowski AG as the sole shareholder of Projekt Sever, showing a 100% paid

contribution of CZK 200,000 equating to a 100% business share in Projekt
Sever.3

241. Documentary evidence submitted by Claimants shows that Pawlowski AG
provided significant funding to Projekt Sever, including (as of 31 December 2018):

= Equity contributions totaling CZK 414,707,000;244
- Loans totaling CZK 649,027,000.745

242. With respect to Projekt Sever’s alleged investments, it is undisputed that Projekt
Sever purchased the land for the Project from private landowners, the City of
Prague and the Czech Republic’s Ministry of Defense.?*°

B. Discussion
243. Article 1(2) of BIT provides the following definition of “investments”:
“The term “in ” shall include every kind of assets and particularly:

(a) movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem, such
as servitudes, mortgages, liens, pledges;

(b) shares, parts or any other kinds of participation in

(c) claims and rights to any performance having an economic value;

(d) copyrights, industrial property rights (such as patents, utility models,
industrial designs or models, trade or service marks, trade names, indications
of origin), know-how and goodwill;

(e) concessions under public law, including concessions to search for, extract
or exploit natural resources as well as all other rights given by law, by contract
or by decision of the authority in accordance with the law.” [Emphasis added]

Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides:

“The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting state (or any constituent
subdivision or agency of a Contracting state designated to the Centre by that
state) and a national of another Contracting state, which the parties to the
dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have
given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.”

The Tribunal will assess the investments of each Claimant in turn.
Pawlowski AG’s investments

Article 1(2) of the BIT makes clear that “investments” includes “shares, parts or
any other kinds of participation in companies.”

It has already been established that Pawlowski AG paid the sum of CZK
200,000.00 for its 100% shareholding in Projekt Sever. There is therefore nothing
to cause the Tribunal to doubt that Pawlowski AG’s shareholding in Projekt Sever
qualifies as a protected investment.

Pawlowski AG also indirectly invested in the Project through its equity
contributions to Projekt Sever.

With respect to the question of whether loans and other equity contributions could
be considered an investment, the tribunal in Standard Chartered noted that:

“The Tribunal accepts that loans and financial instruments standing alone
without any link to some economic venture intended to provide for the
improvement of the State’s development would not be considered an
‘investment’?

However, the Standard Chartered tribunal also noted that it had no doubt that such
loans, when made in the context of financing the construction and operation of a
facility, clearly carried inherent investment risks, thus satisfying the requirement
of “investment risk” under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. As noted by the
tribunal in Standard Chartered, this finding has been confirmed by numerous other
tribunals.748

The Tribunal finds that the loans and contributions extended by Pawlowski AG to
Projekt Sever were analogous to those contemplated by the Standard Chartered

tribunal, as they were made for the direct purpose of financing the purchase and
development of the Project.

The Tribunal therefore finds that Pawlowski AG’s loans and equity contributions,
made to Projekt Sever to support the purchase of land and the development of the
Project, also qualify as protected investments under the BIT and Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention.

Projekt Sever’s investments

Projekt Sever’s alleged investments include its direct investments in the purchase
of land for the Project, and its direct investment in designing and planning the
Project, as well as associated costs.

Article 1(2) of the BIT states explicitly that “investments” shall include “movable
and immovable property.”

Projekt Sever’s purchases of land for the purpose of realising the construction of a
residential development has been well established. These land purchases clearly
fall within the meaning of “investments” provided by the BIT.

Projekt Sever’s expenditures in connection with the design and planning of the
Project have likewise been established, and the Tribunal considers that these
expenditures also qualify under the terms of the BIT, as they constitute “claims and
rights to any performance having an economic value.”

The Tribunal finds that the purchase of land is a perfectly legitimate first step in an
incremental investment intended to be realised in a _ multi-unit
development. Indeed, Projekt Sever’s further expenditures towards the design and
planning of the Project prove that they were not “one-off commercial transactions”,
but rather a series of distinct expenditures all made for the purpose of realising the
development of the Project.

In this case, Pawlowski AG assumed the legal and financial risk of being the 100%
shareholder of the Czech company Projekt Sever. Pawlowski AG then contributed
capital in the form of equity and loans extended to Projekt Sever in order to enable
it to carry out entrepreneurial activity in the Czech Republic — consisting in the
purchase of land for, and the design and planned development of, the residential
project in Benice. The Tribunal thus finds that Respondent’s ratione materiae
objections are inapposite; however “investment” is defined, there is no question
that foreign direct investment, where the foreign investor directly owns and
manages an enterprise situated in the host country, and where said enterprise carries
out entrepreneurial activities in the host country, qualifies as such.”4?

HK

49 See e.g., Ol European, RL-64, para. 224; Edenred, para. 177.

65

259. In view of the above, the Tribunal finds that

- Pawlowski AG’s shareholding in, and its equity contributions to, Projekt Sever,
and

- Projekt Sever’s land purchases and expenditure towards the design and
development of the Project,

each qualify as protected investments under the BIT.

260. Consequently, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent’ s ratione materiae objection.

VI.3. DOMESTIC LAW OBJECTION

POSITION OF RESPONDENT

Respondent argues that Claimants’ claims are inadmissible, because they are
purely domestic claims involving Czech urban planning law, over which the
Tribunal does not have jurisdiction.2”

Additionally, Respondent argues that Claimants have merely listed several Treaty
standards that they say were breached, and that they have not clarified which act or
omission of the Czech Republic, if proven, could constitute a breach of the BIT,
nor have they established any actual interrelationship between their domestic
claims and Treaty claims.”*!

POSITION OF CLAIMANTS

Claimants reject Respondent’s objection to admissibility and aver that their claims
are for violations of the BIT. According to Claimants, Czech domestic law provides
relevant factual context, but Claimants’ claims do not depend on proving any
violation of Czech law.”

Claimants refute the relevance of the case law cited by Respondent, noting that the
Generation Ukraine tribunal, in coming to the conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction,
found that the claimant in that case had raised no international law claims.”°

Claimants assert that in the present case it is obvious from reading Claimants’
submissions on the merits that their claims are for violations of the BIT, not for
violations of domestic Czech law.?*+ Claimants explain that this case does not turn
on the question of whether the district of Benice was required under Czech law to
refrain from filing a lawsuit to challenge the re-zoning of the Project Area to
residential, or whether the Prague City Assembly was required under Czech law to
restore the zoning plan change after it had been annulled by the Czech courts.
Rather, according to Claimants, the relevant question pertinent to the claims in this
arbitration is whether Respondent” s treatment of Claimants violated international
law, and, in particular, the BIT.?°>

3. DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

266. Claimants have made several claims under the BIT. Specifically, Claimants allege
that:

- Respondent has violated the BIT’s Article 4 obligations, including the
requirements to provide fair and equitable treatment, to refrain from
unreasonable, arbitrary and bad faith measures, and to refrain from
discriminatory and less favorable treatment;

= Respondent has breached its obligation pursuant to Article 3 of the BIT to
“provide the necessary permits” in connection with Claimants’ investment; and

- Respondent’s actions resulted in an indirect expropriation of Claimants’
investment, in violation of Article 6 of the BIT.

267. The Tribunal finds that, while several of Claimants’ arguments refer to Czech
domestic law, such references are made in order to provide context for Claimants’
claims under the BIT. This conclusion is consistent with the finding in Binder,
where the tribunal noted that:

“390. The BIT is an international treaty and should be interpreted in
accordance with the principles of international treaty law, as codified in the
Geneva Convention on the Law of Treaties. The Arbitral Tribunal derives its
competence exclusively from the BIT and is not competent to decide how
Czech law Is to be interpreted, this being a matter for the Czech courts.
Consequently, the Tribunal cannot review the interpretation of domestic law
in Czech court decisions. Nor can the Tribunal express an opinion on the
interpretation of Czech law on matters which have not been decided by Czech
courts.

391. However, in this arbitration Czech law is one of the factual el

which the Tribunal must take into account when establishing whether the
Czech Republic has observed its undertakings in the Czech-German BIT. It
is the Tribunal's task to examine whether Czech Law, as it was applied to the
Claimant and his company CARGO, may have violated the obligations of the
Czech Republic in the BIT. In other words, if it should be found that Czech
law had such contents, or was applied in such manner, as to violate any of
these treaty obligations, the Tribunal is competent to establish that a violation
occurred and to draw the legal conclusions following from it. The Tribunal's
examination may not only concern specific acts by the Czech authorities but
also extend to general questions of whether the Czech legal system, including
the availability of judicial and administrative remedies, was sufficient to
provide the Claimant with adequate protection for his investment in the Czech
Republic.” *°° [Emphasis added]

256 Binder, CL-119, paras. 390-391.
68

268. The Tribunal does not have any doubt that Claimants’ claims arise under the BIT.
Indeed, each of Claimants’ claims requires the Tribunal to determine whether
Respondent has violated the BIT with respect to Claimant’s protected investments.

269. While the Tribunal may have to undertake an examination of Czech Law or the
Czech legal framework, such analysis is only undertaken in order to enable the
Tribunal to make determinations as to the merits of Claimants’ international law
claims arising under the BIT.

270. The Tribunal therefore dismisses Respondent’s domestic law objection.

69

VII. MERITS

271.

Having determined that it has jurisdiction, the Tribunal now turns to the merits and
to Claimants’ allegation that the Czech Republic’s conduct towards their
investments was in breach of Articles 3, 4, and 6 of the BIT.

272. Claimants make four general points with respect to the merits:

273. First, Claimants ask that the Tribunal consider the Preamble of the BIT, which
records the Contracting States’ desire “to intensify economic cooperation” and “to
promote and protect foreign investments” as well as their desire to “create and
maintain favourable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting
Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party.”?°”

274. Second, Claimants note that they are not required to prove fault in the sense of
intention to harm. Claimants quote Mondev, which found that “‘it is only the act of
a state that matters, independently of any intention.”?*

275. Third, Claimants argue that a violation of a treaty obligation is not excused by the
fact that the acts in question may have complied with the internal laws of the
259
state.

276. Fourth, Claimants argue that the Tribunal does not need to decide whether each of
Benice’s and the City of Prague’s individual actions was wrongful; the events
should be considered “cumulatively in context to each other,” with the ultimate
question being whether the cumulative effect of Respondent’s actions amounts to
a violation of the BIT.7°!

277. Respondent rejects all of the claims, arguing that Claimants not only misconstrue
the legal standards applicable to Articles 3, 4, and 6 of the BIT, but also that they
fail to demonstrate facts that could amount to a treaty violation; the claims, it says,
are nothing more than alleged breaches of Czech domestic law.

278. First, according to Respondent, it is a foundational principle of international law
that its norms are separate and distinct from those of domestic law. A breach of

domestic law does not, therefore, automatically amount to a breach international
law. 76?

Second, Respondent explains that Claimants’ claims centre around the Municipal
Court of Prague’s and the Supreme Administrative Court’s annulment of the
Zoning Plan Change and the City of Prague’s subsequent failure to override those
court judgments. Claimants are only submitting breaches of domestic law and they
have failed to include arguments that could convert their claims into breaches of
international law.

Third, Respondent argues that, even if the Tribunal were to find that Claimants
presented international law claims, the Czech Republic did not violate Articles 3,
4, or 6 of the BIT."

The Tribunal will start by analysing whether the Czech Republic has breached
Article 4 of the BIT [VII.1], Claimant’s main claim, and it will devote separate
sections to the two ancillary claims submitted: the breach of the obligation to grant
the necessary permits under Article 3 [VII.2] and the breach of the prohibition to
expropriate under Article 6 [VII.3].

VII.1. BREACH OF ARTICLE 4 OF THE BIT

282. Claimants’ principal claim is that the Czech Republic breached its duty to

guarantee “fair and equitable treatment” (“FET”) as required by Article 4(2) and
the prohibition against “unreasonable or discriminatory measures” provided for in
Article 4(1) of the BIT.2°

283. Article 4 of the BIT reads as follows:

“(1) Each Contracting Party shall protect within its territory investments made
in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other
Contracting Party and shall not impair by unreasonable or discriminatory
measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and
liquidation of such investments. [...]

(2) Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment within its
territory of the investments of the investors of the other Contracting Party.
This treatment shall not be less favourable than that granted by each
Contracting Party to the investments made within its territory by its own
investors or than that granted by each Contracting Party to the investments
within its territory by investors of the most favoured nation, if this latter is
more favourable. [...]” [Emphasis added]

284. The rule thus imposes both a positive and a negative obligation upon the Czech

Republic:

The positive obligation is to accord within its territory FET to the protected
investments of Swiss investors; and the standard applied must not be less than
the treatment given to its own investors or those of the most favoured nation;

The negative obligation is to abstain from impairing any protected investment
through the adoption of measures which are either unreasonable or
discriminatory.

285. Claimants argue that Respondent breached the FET standard enshrined in Article

4 in three ways:
By adopting unreasonable measures [VII.1.2];

By adopting discriminatory measures, which provided less favorable treatment
to Claimants’ investments [VII.1.3.] and

By violating Claimants’ legitimate expectations [VII.1.4.].

265 C_II, para. 398.

72

286. Before analyzing each of the alleged breaches, the Tribunal will devote a section
to analyse Article 4 in general [VII.1.1].

VII.1.1. APPLICABLE LAW: ARTICLE 4 OF THE BIT

287. Claimants say that Respondent’s conduct resulted in a breach of Articles 4(1) and
(2) of the BIT.

1. THE FET STANDARD

288. The first sentence of Article 4(2) of the BIT is a rule of laconic brevity and delphic
obscurity: it simply obliges the Contracting States to ensure “fair and equitable
treatment” to investments of protected investors.

289. The FET standard requires that the host state treat the protected investment in an
even-handed and just manner, avoiding intentional harassment and denial of
justice. The precise scope of protection is intimately related:

= to the legitimate and reasonable expectations on which the investor relied,
including the stability of the host State’s legal framework; and

- to the specific undertakings and representations proffered by the host State at the
time when the investment was made.

290. The legitimacy or reasonableness of the investor’s expectations must be assessed
in conjunction with the political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical conditions
in the host State, and in particular, balancing the right of the State under
international law to regulate within its borders.

291. The obligation to provide FET binds the State as a whole. It can be breached by the
conduct of any branch of government. In principle, then, the FET standard can be
breached:

- by the executive or administrative branch or its separate agencies by means of
administrative acts that directly target the investment;

- by the State’s judicial system as a whole, when it is responsible for a denial of
justice which affects the investment; or

- by the enactment of laws or regulations of general application, which radically
modify the applicable legal framework to the detriment of the investment.

292. The threshold of propriety required by FET must be determined by the Tribunal in
light of all the relevant circumstances of the case. To this end, the Tribunal must
carefully analyse and take into consideration all the relevant facts, and, inter alia,
weigh the following factors:

73

293.

294.

295.

296.

297.

whether the State made specific representations to the investor before the
investment was made and then acted contrary to such representations;

whether the State has failed to offer a stable and predictable legal framework, in
breach of the investor’s legitimate expectations;

whether the host State has engaged in harassment, coercion, abuse of power, or
other bad faith conduct against the investor?™;

whether the State has respected the principles of due process, consistency and
transparency when adopting the measures at issue.

In evaluating the State’s conduct, the Tribunal must balance the investor’s right to
be protected from improper State conduct against other legally relevant interests
and countervailing factors. First among these factors is the principle that legislation
and regulation are dynamic, and that (absent a treaty obligation to the contrary)
States enjoy a sovereign right to amend their laws and regulations and to adopt new
ones in furtherance of the public interest. Other countervailing factors affect the
investor: it is the investor’s duty to perform an appropriate pre-investment due
diligence review and to conduct itself in accordance with the law both before and
during the investment.?®

UNREASONABLE MEASURES

Under Article 4(1) of the BIT, the Czech Republic has assumed the negative
obligation to abstain from unreasonable or discriminatory measures affecting
protected investments. A literal interpretation of the rule shows that for a measure
to amount to a violation of the BIT it is sufficient if it is either unreasonable or
discriminatory; it need not be both.

Any unreasonable or discriminatory measure may, by definition, also be said to be
unfair and inequitable. The reverse is not true, though. A government measure may
fall short of the FET standard, for reasons other than that it is discriminatory or
unreasonable.?°*

An interesting feature of Article 4(1) of the BIT is the drafters’ choice of
terminology. Other BITs include a prohibition against “arbitrary or discriminatory”
measures. The Swiss-Czech BIT however uses the expression “unreasonable or
discriminatory” measures.

Are “unreasonable measures” and “arbitrary measures” synonymous?

266 Bad faith conduct is a factor which must be taken into consideration by the Tribunal, but the Claimant
is not required to prove fault in the sense of intention to harm; See Mondev, CL-13, para. 116.

Arbitrary measures

Arbitrariness has been described as “founded on prejudice or preference rather than
on reason or fact”;?®? “[...] contrary to the law because: ‘[it] shocks, or at least
surprises, a sense of juridical propriety’”;?” or (in very similar terms) “willful
disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises a sense
of judicial propriety”;?”! or as conduct which “manifestly violate[s] the
requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and non-

discrimination.”?”
In EDF, Professor Schreuer, appearing as an expert, defined as “arbitrary”:?”>

“a. a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any
apparent legitimate purpose;

b. a measure that is not based on legal standards, but on discretion, prejudice
or personal preference;

c. ameasure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the
decision maker;

d. a measure taken in willful disregard of due process and proper procedure.”

And the EDF tribunal seemed to accept his definition in its analysis and ultimate
rejection of the claim that Romania had adopted arbitrary measures.””*

Unreasonable measures

The BIT does not refer to “arbitrary measures.” It prohibits “unreasonable
measures”, i.e., measures adopted by the host State that are irrational in themselves
or result from an irrational decision-making process. All arbitrary measures are, by
definition, unreasonable, because rational State action cannot result in the
substitution of the rule of law by prejudice, preference or bias.””> The opposite is
not necessarily true: an irrational decision-making process may result in an
unreasonable measure, but the content of the measure does not have to be arbitrary
(although in most cases, unreasonable decision-making will result in arbitrary
results). In any case, the exposure to irrational processes may by itself be a breach
of the duty to act in accordance with the FET standard.

The tribunal in LG&E said that the contracting states (in that case Argentina and
the United States)?”

“wanted to prohibit themselves from implementing measures that affect the
investments of nationals of the other Party without engaging in a rational
decision-making process.” [Emphasis added]

The LG&E tribunal added:

“Certainly a State that fails to base its actions on reasoned judgement, and
uses abusive arguments instead, would not ‘stimulate the flow of private
capital’.” [Emphasis added]

It is noteworthy that the treaty under consideration in LG&E contained a
prohibition in respect of “arbitrary or discriminatory measures”, and that the
tribunal concluded that unreasonable or irrational measures breached such
prohibition — proving the proximity of and overlap between both concepts. The
Tribunal agrees with Claimants’ conclusion that in investment arbitration cases, the
term “unreasonable” is often used interchangeably with the terms “unjustified” or
“arbitrary.”?77

Be that as it may, in the present case, Claimants plead the higher standard: they say
that the measures adopted by the Czech Republic were not only unreasonable, but
that they also meet the arbitrariness test.

DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES

Article 4(1) of the BIT also prohibits the adoption by the Czech Republic of
discriminatory measures against a protected investment. Article 4(2) provides an
additional rule: the treatment must not be less favourable than the treatment granted
to investments made by Czech investors, or by investors of the most favoured
nation, if this latter treatment is more favourable.

Discrimination means unequal or different treatment. But this, in itself, is
insufficient. To amount to discrimination, the protected investment must be treated
differently from similar cases without justification’’® such that the host State
“expos[es] the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice”?” or “target[s] Claimants’
investments specifically as foreign investments.”?*°

Discrimination is a relative standard, which requires a comparative analysis
between the measures applied to the protected investment and the measures applied
to investments in similar situations. One leading commentator provides the

following guidance by which to establish whether similar cases are being treated
differently”*!:

“... start by looking at a narrow circle of comparators that are closest to the

case at hand. In other words, the treatment of other investors in the same line
of business will have to be looked at first. If there are clear indications of
discrimination already on that basis, the matter may be regarded as settled.
But the absence of discrimination within this narrow group is not necessarily
conclusive. For instance, if the particular sector of the economy is small or is
strongly dominated by foreign interests, it would not be sufficient for the
tribunal to satisfy itself that no discrimination has occurred within that group
of investors. The circle may be widened to a broader sector of activity that
includes a variety of economic actors until a workable basis for comparison
can be found.”

 

 

National Treatment and Most Favored-Nation treatment

308.

io}

Article 4(2) of the BIT defines the National Treatment (“NT”) and the Most
Favored-Nation (“MFN’) standards:

“This treatment shall not be less favourable than that granted by each
Contracting Party to the investments made within its territory by its own
investors or than that granted by each Contracting Party to the investments
within its territory by investors of the most favoured nation, if this latter is
more favourable.” [Emphasis added]

309. The NT and MEN standards, which are closely related to the wider and
overreaching FET standard,”** prohibit discrimination based on nationality. Under
these standards the Czech Republic may not subject protected investors or their
investments to a treatment which is “less favourable” than that which the host State
accords to investments owned by other investors — either Czech or from other
countries. To establish that the treatment effectively is “less favourable,” a
comparator in like circumstances must be defined.”* It is also widely accepted that
there must be no objective reason which justifies the differential treatment.?**

VII.1.2. UNREASONABLE MEASURES

310. Claimants argue that certain measures adopted by the Czech Republic, or by agents and
institutions for which the State is responsible under international law, were not only
unreasonable, but that these measures also met the test of being arbitrary (and even in bad
faith).

311. The Tribunal will first summarise the position of Claimants and Respondent [1. and 2.] and
then state its own decision [3.]

1. POSITION OF CLAIMANTS

312. Claimants say that the conduct of Benice [1.1] and of the City of Prague [1.2] — which is
directly attributable to the Czech Republic?** — was unreasonable, arbitrary and lacking in
good faith. It thereby violated the protection against unreasonable treatment in Article 4(1)
and the guarantees of FET under Article 4(2), as explained below.

1.1. THE CONDUCT OF BENICE’S MAYOR AND THE BENICE DISTRICT ASSEMBLY WAS
ARBITRARY, UNREASONABLE AND IN BAD FAITH

313. Claimants point to three particular actions of Mayor Topigova and the Benice District
Assembly which they argue were arbitrary, unreasonable and in bad faith:

= Mayor Topigova’s multiple attempts to extract payment from Claimants [A.];

- Benice’s filing of the Annulment Request, seeking to annul the Zoning Plan Change [B.];
and

- Benice’s opposition to reprocuring the Zoning Plan Change [C.].

314. Claimants also argue that these actions taken by officials of Benice and of the City of Prague
were not only arbitrary, unreasonable and taken in bad faith, but that they also violated the
FET standard for want of transparency.”*° According to Claimants, the lack of transparency
stems from Respondent’s inconsistent application of its own laws and from its incoherent
behaviour surrounding the procurement of the Zoning Plan Change.?*”

A. Benice’s attempts to extract payment from Claimants violated the FET standard

315. Claimants assert that Mayor Topiéova was the driving force behind Benice’s attempts to
annul the zoning plan change and thereby destroy the Project. According to Claimants,
Mayor Topiéova exercised her power as Mayor of Benice to try to extort unjustified

 

s. 66-68; an argument which Respondent does not deny.
482.
287 C_II, para. 479.

 

78

payments from Claimants. When these efforts were unsuccessful, she retaliated by filing the
Annulment Request.?**

316. Claimants identify three actions taken by Mayor Topiéova in violation of the FET standard:

317. First, Claimants say that Mayor Topiéova attempted to extort funds from them with the 2009
Benice Lawsuit, which challenged Projekt Sever’s title to the land it had purchased from the
City of Prague. Claimants note that Ms. Topiéova has not denied that Benice made these
payment demands, and that she refused to answer when asked at the Hearing whether she
would have challenged the zoning change if Projekt Sever had paid what Benice demanded
in 2009.7

318. Second, Claimants say that Mayor Topigova tried again to extort payment from them by
withholding Benice’s approval of the density increase from OB-B to OB-C in early 2011. In
this case Mayor Topi¢ova withheld approval while asking for a payment from Claimants of
CZK 15 million in exchange for Benice’s “smooth cooperation in the permitting stages.”
Claimants note that Ms. Topicova does not deny this, and that she admits having met with
Mr. Pawlowski and asking him to contribute to “civil amenities.”?°°

319. Third, Claimants point to Mayor Topiéova’s lack of response regarding the connection of
the Project to gas lines and to the sewer system. Claimants argue that while such requests
are normally acted on within a matter of days, in this case Benice did not respond. Claimants
believe that Mayor Topiéova was again attempting to extract payments from Mr. Pawlowski
by using this request as leverage.”*!

B. Benice’s Annulment Request was unreasonable

320. Claimants argue that Benice’s filing of the Annulment Request to prevent residential
development of the area altogether was a use of legal process for a purpose for which it was
not intended, in violation of the FET standard.?°” According to Claimants, this would still be
the case even if the Tribunal were to find that Benice had filed the Annulment Request due
to its alleged concerns about the scale of the Project”®*; the filing of an annulment lawsuit
should still be considered a disproportionate measure in light of available alternatives (such
as seeking to reduce the scope of the Project) and that it was thus a violation of the FET
standard.?°4

Furthermore, since Benice acted to destroy the Claimants’ investment without providing any
advance notice, this also violated the FET standard transparency requirement.”

Benice’s opposition to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change was unreasonable

According to Claimants, Benice’s insistence that there should be no residential development
of the Project Area whatsoever was entirely unreasonable and disproportionate in the context
of the achievement of the policy aims claimed by Respondent. This subsequent behaviour
both confirms that Benice’s filing of the annulment lawsuit was not brought in good faith
and for proper purposes and is itself a violation of the FET standard.?°°

Claimants assert that after the Annulment Decision was issued, Benice could, and should,
have supported re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change, while at the same time
addressing its alleged concerns with respect to the scope and potential impact of the Project
on the local community.

THE ACTIONS OF THE CITY OF PRAGUE WERE UNREASONABLE

Claimants also maintain that the City of Prague acted unreasonably. Specifically, Claimants
allege that Mayor Hudeéek’s blocking of the normal re-procurement process [A.] and the
City Assembly’s decision to terminate the procurement of the Zoning Plan Change [B.]
amounted to breaches of Article 4 of the BIT.

Mayor Hudeéek’s refusal to allow the normal re-procurement process to proceed

According to Claimants, if the landowner wanted to pursue the change, the normal course of
action following the Annulment Decision would have been for the City of Prague’s Zoning
Plan Division (the Procurer) promptly to remedy the deficiencies.’ Claimants assert that
this would have only required drafting a more detailed substantiation for approval by the
City Assembly, and there were no substantive reasons why the zoning plan change could not
have been re-procured.”°*

Claimants allege that the normal course of action was interrupted by Mayor Hudeéek, who
prevented the City from moving forward with the re-procurement during his entire term in
office.?”?

The City’s decision to terminate the procurement

In Claimants’ view, not only was it standard practice for the City Assembly to re-procure
zoning changes annulled by Czech Courts, it was also outside the City Assembly’s discretion
to decide whether or not to proceed with the procurement.** Thus, Claimants argue that the

Prague City Assembly’s decision to terminate the procurement was unreasonable, arbitrary
and disproportionate.*?!

Claimants allege that Deputy Mayor Stropnicky acted arbitrarily and unreasonably, because
he opposed the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change without visiting the site or
examining the substance or history of the Project. According to Claimants, in all other cases
where a request had been made for re-procurement, the re-procurement was initiated without
being subjected to a vote of the City Assembly.*

Claimants also note that the City of Prague’s treatment of Claimants was different from what
would usually be expected, since it marked the first time in the history of the Czech Republic
that an applicant for a zoning change had requested annulment of the zoning change after it
had come into effect, and that a zoning change was annulled for formal reasons and not re-
procured again, notwithstanding the landowner’s request.*”*

POSITION OF RESPONDENT.

Respondent denies that Benice [2.1] or the City of Prague [2.2] acted arbitrarily,
unreasonably or in bad faith, and makes the following preliminary clarifications regarding
both bad faith and transparency:

Bad faith

Respondent argues that Claimants’ description of the requirement of good faith is flawed.
Respondent argues that Claimants have in any event failed to prove any bad faith on the part

of the State, while noting that the standard of proof for allegations of bad faith is “a
demanding one.”*™*

According to Respondent, it cannot have acted in bad faith, since there were legitimate and
objective reasons which led the City Assembly to terminate the procurement of the Zoning
Plan Change, including:

The non-applicability of Section 55(3) to the annulled Zoning Change with the
consequence that the Prague Assembly had no obligation to resume the procurement

process;

The fact that the annulment of the Zoning Change had restored the land to its original
functional use;

Benice’s opposition to the procurement process;

The various substantive and procedural defects of the annulled Zoning Change, as

The fact that Projekt Server was specifically advised of the possibility of filing a new
application for a zoning change.

Projekt Sever had bought the land while it was zoned for agricultural purposes, the same
use to which the land was restored.*°5

Transparency

Respondent argues that there is no basis for Claimants’ assertions of non-transparency.
According to Respondent, the simple fact that the Czech Republic might have departed from
usual practice does not establish a lack of transparency or arbitrariness.*°°

NEITHER BENICE’S MAYOR NOR THE BENICE DISTRICT ASSEMBLY ACTED IN AN
UNREASONABLE OR ARBITRARY MANNER

According to Respondent, the threshold for a finding of arbitrariness is very high, requiring
conduct which “shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety.”*°”

Respondent argues that Claimants’ allegations are unfounded. It maintains that Mayor
Topicova never tried to extort money from Claimants [A.] and Benice’s actions were within
its prerogatives and neither unreasonable, nor unjustifiable [B.].

The Mayor of Benice never tried to extort money from Claimants

Respondent rejects the assertion that Mayor Topitovd improperly attempted to extract
payments from Claimants. Rather, Mayor Topi¢ova’s main concern was ensuring that
Benice had sufficient resources to adapt its infrastructure to the anticipated large influx of
new residents.°”8

With respect to Mayor Topi¢ova’s request for CZK 15 million, Respondent claims that
Mayor Topi¢ova was simply defending the interests of her community by attempting to
negotiate with Mr. Pawlowski and thereby obtain funds to renovate Benice’s civic amenities
and infrastructure.*

As regards Mayor Topicova’s requests for CZK 20 and 30 million, Respondent argues that
Mayor Topicova was simply negotiating (through Benice’s lawyers) to recover the proceeds
of the land sale through a settlement.>!°

Benice did not act in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner

Respondent avers that there was no abuse of legal process in Benice seeking annulment of
the Zoning Change, and that Benice was simply exerting its legal right before the Czech
courts.31!

Respondent also notes that there were no improper motives behind Benice’s exercise of its
legal right to seek annulment of the Zoning Change. Respondent asserts that Mayor Topi¢ova
had no personal animosity against Mr. Pawlowski or any reason to “retaliate” against him.
Rather, Mayor Topi¢ova simply acted in the interests of Benice, due to the impact that
Claimants’ huge Project would have had on the municipality and its inhabitants.*!”

Respondent rejects the notion that it was unheard of for a municipality to propose, and later
to challenge, the same zoning plan change. To the contrary, Respondent argues that, as
zoning plan changes are the subject of a long and democratic process, it is in fact a frequent
occurrence that a borough, after having applied for a zoning change, will then change its
mind and withdraw it.>'5

Proportionality

With respect to proportionality, Respondent argues that proportionality suggests an
alternative which existed to achieve a similar result, while being less detrimental to the
Claimants. However, Respondent argues, in this case Benice had no alternative way to avoid
the construction of the Project — which would have had a negative impact on Benice and its
inhabitants.*!4

Respondent says that Benice would not have been able to influence the Project’s
development during the permitting stage: once a zoning change comes into force, from that
moment on, the local government “does not interfere into the permitting process in the way
it could during the procurement of the zoning change.”*'> Thus, Benice’s only means of
alleviating its concerns was to seek annulment of the Zoning Plan Change through the Czech
Courts.

THE CITY OF PRAGUE DID NOT ACT UNREASONABLY OR ARBITRARILY
Respondent rejects the complaint that the City of Prague acted arbitrarily or unreasonably.

Mayor Hudeéek acted appropriately

Respondents aver that neither the Mayor, nor his Deputy Mayor, acted arbitrarily.

Change at the meetings of the City Assembly. According to Respondent, both Mayor
Hudeéek and Mr. Bohaé have confirmed that the regular practice in dealing with zoning
changes was followed, and that the Mayor adhered to the technical advice of the Zoning Plan
Division.*!°

Respondent also rejects the allegation that Deputy Mayor Stropnicky made statements to the
Assembly inimical to the interests of Mr. Pawlowski or the zoning plan change.*!’ To the
extent that the Deputy Mayor may have been opposed to the Claimants’ Project in principle,
Respondent argues that this was not the result of any animosity or arbitrary action against
Mr. Pawlowski, but due to Deputy Mayor Stropnicky’s political views, which were in line
with those of the Green Party which he represented, and which were generally against
developers, who have sought to develop the outskirts of the City of Prague for maximum
profit and at the expense of the City.>'®

The Prague City Assembly also acted appropriately

With respect to the actions of the Prague City Assembly, Respondent argues that these
actions cannot be construed as arbitrary or unjustifiable, since in all instances, the Assembly
acted in full compliance with Czech law, demonstrating no abuse of administrative
discretion.>°

Respondent asserts that Claimants’ claim is based on the premise that, following the
Annulment Decision, the Prague City Assembly acted abusively and in breach of the
applicable law, particularly Section 55(3) of the 2006 Building Act. However, according to
Respondent, the Prague City Assembly was never in breach of Section 55(3) of the Building
Act, since*?°;

this section of the Building Act applies to annulled zoning plans, and not annulled zoning
changes**!;

the Prague City Assembly nevertheless decided “without delay” on the re-procurement of
the Zoning Plan Change*”’; and

irrespective of whether Section 55(3) applied in the circumstances, it did not impose any
obligation on the Prague City Assembly to re-procure an annulled zoning change.*”°

DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

institutions for which the State is responsible under international law, were not only

unreasonable, but that these measures also met the test of being arbitrary, and even in bad
faith, in breach of the general prohibition of “unreasonable measures” contained in Article
4(1) (and of the FET standard enshrined in Article 4(2) of the BIT).

Claimants single out the following measures:

Mayor Topiéova’s attempts to extract payment from Claimants;

Benice’s filing of the Annulment Request, by which it sought to annul the Zoning Plan
Change;

Benice’s opposition to the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change;

Mayor Hudeéek’s refusal to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change; and

The City Assembly’s decision to terminate the procurement.
Respondent disagrees:

It says that Mayor Topicova never tried to extort money from Claimants and that Benice’s
actions were within its prerogatives and neither unreasonable nor unjustifiable;

As regards the actions of Mayor Topi¢ova and Deputy Mayor Stropnicky, Respondents
aver that neither the Mayor, nor the Deputy Mayor acted arbitrarily;

With respect to the actions of the Prague City Assembly, Respondent argues that these
actions cannot be construed as arbitrary or unjustifiable, since in all instances the
Assembly acted in full compliance with Czech law, demonstrating no abuse of
administrative discretion.>”4

In the following subsections, the Tribunal will analyze Mayor Topi¢ova’s conduct with
respect to the requests for payment [3.1.], the filing by Benice of the annulment [3.2.], Mayor

Hudeéek’s refusal to support the re-procurement [3.3.] the City Assembly’s decision to
terminate the procurement [3.4.] and Benice’s opposition to the re-procurement [3.5.].

THE REQUESTS FOR PAYMENT

The Tribunal will first briefly recall the facts [A.] and will then analyse whether such conduct
violates the BIT [B.].

Proven facts

The proven facts show that Benice’s Mayor requested funds from the investor on two
occasions. Claimants also refer to certain other instances,

325 where the conduct of Mayor

357.

358.

Topicova allegedly was detrimental to Claimants’ interests, but the Tribunal has found no
evidence that these incidents resulted from improper requests for the disbursements of funds.

First attempt

In October 2009, Benice filed the Benice Lawsuit against Project Sever, contesting the
validity of Projekt Sever’s purchase of land from the City of Prague. Benice asseverated that
its District, and not the District of Uhiinéves, should have represented the City of Prague in
the sale of the land*”° and that the purchase price should have been received by Benice and
not by Uhifnéves.*?’

Shortly after Benice filed the lawsuit, a lawyer representing the District of Benice informed
Dr. Zugar (Mr. Pawlowski’s lawyer) that Benice would be willing to withdraw the Court
case if Claimants paid the District CZK 20 million.**® Mr. Pawlowski met with Benice’s
Mayor Topiéova, who explained that the District had been deprived of the funds that the City
of Prague had received for the land purchased and that CZK 30 million (an increase from
the CZK 20 million previously mentioned by Benice’s lawyer to Mr. Pawlowski’s lawyer)
would be an adequate compensation to reach an amicable settlement.*?? Mr. Pawlowski
refused to make the payment and protested against what he saw as an the attempt to hold
him hostage in these circumstances.**”

Second attempt

On 19 January 2011, Projekt Sever submitted a proposal to increase the density coefficient
from 0.3 (“OB-B”) to 0.5 (“OB-C”).**! The Construction Division of Prague 22 and the
Deputy Mayor of Uhiinéves both approved the proposal. Benice, however, issued a negative
opinion, noting that it stood by its original statement on the project from December 2008.**

Shortly thereafter, Mayor Topiéova informed Dr. Dobrohruskova, a lawyer with DLA Piper
hired to assist Claimants on planning issues, that the District could accept a density increase,
but requested a payment from Projekt Sever to the District of Benice, as consideration for its
cooperation.*** On 6 May 2011, Mayor Topiéovd, using her private email address, sent an
email to Dr. Dobrohruskova, confirming that a meeting had taken place and that the matter
discussed had been “retracting our original negative opinion” to the modification of the
Zoning Plan from OB-B to OB-C. She requested Mr. Pawlowski to make a concrete
proposal.**+

355 Topiéova WS IL.
336 Topiéova WS IL.

On two occasions, Mayor Topiéova, acting on behalf of the District of Benice, asked
Claimants for certain payments; the first request was made in 2009 and the second in 2011;

The first request was for an amount of initially CZK 20 million, thereafter increased to
CZK 30 million; the second request was apparently for CZK 15 million (this is the amount
averred by Claimants; the Mayor, although acknowledging that the request took place,
does not recall the specific amount);**>

It is acknowledged that the suggestion was that Projekt Sever should pay the funds to the
District of Benice — not personally to Mayor Topicova;

Projekt Sever was under no legal obligation to make these payments; Respondent has not
drawn the Tribunal’s attention to any legal provision creating such obligation. To the
contrary, Mayor Topiéova presented the payments as a quid pro quo; if Projekt Sever made
the first payment, the District would withdraw the Benice Lawsuit, and if it made the
second payment, the District would abandon its opposition to the increase in the density
coefficient;

Mayor Topiéova explained in her witness statements that the purpose of the first payment
request was “to reach an amicable settlement in the context of the lawsuit that contested
the sale”*** of the land to Projekt Sever, and the purpose of the second request was to
“renovate Bernice’s civic amenities”;**”

Mr. Pawlowski and Claimants rejected both payment requests.
Discussion

The question before the Tribunal is whether the payment requests made by Mayor Topicéova,
on behalf of the District of Benice, constitute an unreasonable measure, in breach of the
specific prohibition and of the general FET standard guaranteed in Article 4 of the BIT.

The Tribunal finds that Benice’s conduct does indeed constitute a breach of Article 4 of the
BIT. In coming to this conclusion, the Tribunal finds the following arguments compelling:

First, public authorities are vested with wide ranging powers, to be exercised in the
furtherance of the common good; to prevent misuse, it is a generally accepted principle of
the rule of law that such powers should be established by law and exercised in accordance
with proper procedure. The risk of misuse is especially severe when powers are used to

requiring citizens to contribute funds to public institutions, must strictly respect the
principles of legality and proper administrative procedure.

364. In the present case, these principles have not been adhered to:

Respondent has failed to refer to any Czech law, authorising the Mayor of Benice to
condition the withdrawal of a lawsuit or the consent to a change in the zoning requirements
upon the making of payments by the affected private individuals; the necessary conclusion
is that Mayor Topiéova acted on her own initiative, her conduct being neither foreseen in,
nor authorized by, any legal norm;

The proven facts also show that Mayor Topi¢ova did not adhere to any proper
administrative procedure; there is no evidence in the file that she sought the authorisation
of the Benice District Assembly or of any other administrative body, nor that she initiated
any administrative procedure to document and formalise the payment requests. She
informally convened meetings with Mr. Pawlowski or with his counsel, which were not
recorded or summarised in writing, and in the course of these meetings she informed the
investor that if certain amounts were paid, the District would amend its conduct to the
benefit of the investor. It is telling that the only communication in the file which Mayor
Topiéova sent to Claimants or their counsel regarding the requests for payment was issued
from her private gmail account, and not from her official account at the Municipality;

There is no evidence in the file that the amounts requested (CZK 15 million, CZK 20
million and eventually CZK 30 million) were established on the basis of rational analysis
or by reference to the specific costs and benefits to the District of Benice to which the
Project would give rise; to the contrary, the figures seem to have been estimated by Mayor
Topiéova as the highest amounts which the investor was likely to accept; in the email sent
to Dr. Dobrohruskova (Claimants’ counsel), the Mayor went so far as to request the
developer to make a counter-offer:

“[...] we would like to see at least some concept of the agreement, so that we can discuss
it. Could I ask you to inform me of Mr. Pawlowski’s view of the matter?”***

Arbitrariness

365. As the Tribunal has noted at para. 299 above, Professor Schreuer has defined as “arbitrary”

measures which fall into four categories:

“a. a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent
legitimate purpose;

b. a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal
preference;

c. a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision
maker;

338 E-Mail from Mayor Topigova to Dr. Dobrohru’kova, 6 May 2011, C-68.

88

d. a measure taken in willful disregard of due process and proper procedure.”*”

366. Mayor Topiéova’s actions fall within two of Prof. Schreuer’s categories:

- the requests for payments were not based on any legal standard and had no objective
rational basis, and

- they were made in total disregard of due process and proper procedure.

The necessary consequence is that these measures must be considered arbitrary — and by
extension unreasonable; all arbitrary measures are by definition unreasonable, because
rational action on the part of a State cannot result in the substitution of the rule of law by
prejudice, preference or bias.*4°

367. Second, Claimants say that Mr. Pawlowski was faced with a classic “red flag” situation, in
which it appeared that a public official was demanding corrupt payments for doing a job that
should be done anyway, as required by law, and that for this reason he (properly) refused to
make a payment.**! Mr. Pawlowski adds that he became suspicious, because the amount
asked for was very high compared with the annual budget of the Benice District, which only
amounted to CZK 3 million (most of the administration being done by the District of
Uhiinéves).*?

368. The Tribunal has sympathy for Mr. Pawlowski’s predicament, even accepting that Mayor
Topicova’s aim was to obtain monies for the benefit of Benice District.

369. The request made by Mayor Topiéova did constitute a “red flag.” Investors should not be
required to make, and they are entitled to, and should, abstain from making, ostensibly
facilitative payments in favour of public institutions of the host State, as a guid pro quo for
administrative measures which, by law, such institutions are obliged to provide for free —
especially if such payments have no support in law and the amount has been essentially
plucked out of the air by the public official concerned. Had Mr. Pawlowski paid, he would
have opened the floodgates to a possible challenge or even incrimination that the investment
was procured through corrupt means.

370. Third, Mayor Topiéova’s decision to file the Benice Lawsuit against Projekt Sever, the buyer
of the land, but not against Uhiinéves, the seller, might seem counterintuitive and legally
flawed. In fact, there are indications that, by suing Projekt Sever but not Uhiinéves, Benice’s
real aim was to force a negotiation with the investor and to extract additional payments:

- Benice’s main argument in the Benice Lawsuit was that the purchase price of the land
should flow to Benice and not to Uhiinéves; Projekt Sever, the buyer, had already paid the
full purchase price to Uhiinéves, and the reasonable way to proceed would have been to
request that the recipient of the funds disgorge the allegedly ill-gotten proceeds;

374.

At the Hearing, when questioned about the payment required from Claimants in order to
drop the lawsuit, Mayor Topicova admitted to instructing Benice’s lawyers “to get the sum
of money for the sale of the land located in our cadastral territory”,**? and refused to

comment further;*“*

The Benice Lawsuit was ultimately dismissed, in the first instance by the District Court
and thereafter on appeal, due to Benice’s lack of standing: Municipal Districts cannot own
property and only act as managers of entrusted property;**° additionally, the Court rejected
the argument that Benice was in charge of administering the plots of land and confirmed
that Uhiinéves was the rightful administrator.*4°

Summing up, while the Tribunal is prepared to accept that the requests for significant
payments from Projekt Sever as a condition for the withdrawal of the Benice Lawsuit filed
by the District and for the District’s change of opinion with regard to the increase in the
density coefficient, were made for the benefit of the residents of Benice, the fact remains
that the requests were made without any support in Czech law and outside any established
administrative procedure. The investors were entitled to consider such requests to be
irregular, improper, and even indicative of, or as an invitation to engage in, conduct that is
unlawful.

The Tribunal does not consider it fair that investors should be put in a position where they
are requested by a public authority to make payments to secure the progress of their projects,
unless the invitations are made within an established and transparent legal and administrative
framework. That is so regardless of the motives or the intended use of any funds paid or
sought to be procured. For this reason, the Tribunal considers that the requests made to
Projekt Sever on behalf of Benice District do not meet the standard of reasonableness
mandated by Article 4(1) and fall short of the standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment that
Article 4(2) requires the Respondent to ensure.

The Mayor of Benice represents an organ of the Czech Republic at a territorial level, and in
accordance with Article 4 of the ILC Articles her conduct must be attributed to the Czech
Republic. The necessary consequence is that the Czech Republic has committed an
internationally wrongful act in breach of the BIT.

FILING OF THE ANNULMENT REQUEST BY BENICE

was an arbitrary” and disproportionate** measure in violation of Article 4(1) of the BIT.

the Zoning Change, and that Benice was simply exerting its legal right before the Czech
Courts.*°

In order to determine whether Benice’s filing of the Annulment Request constitutes a
violation of the BIT, the Tribunal will first briefly set out the facts [A.], and will then discuss
and decide the issue [B.].

Proven facts

Pro memoria, by early 2012, the development of the Project seemed to be proceeding as
planned: the Zoning Change had been approved by the Prague Assembly, the increase in
density had been accepted by the Municipal authority and the planning permit application,
the last step before the building permit, had been submitted by Claimants’ architects.

But then the District of Benice, led by Mayor Topicova, and two residents of Uhiinéves (and
immediate neighbours to the Project area),*>° decided to file the Annulment Request. On 21
June 2012 Mayor Topiéova informed the Benice District Assembly of her meeting with the
two neighbours and of her proposal to file the Request. Upon Mayor Topigova’s proposals,
the Assembly decided to cooperate with the two neighbours and to submit the Request to the
Municipal Court of Prague, seeking annulment of the Zoning Plan Change, in order to
“prevent the realization of the [Project] or at least to minimize its scale.”*>!

A week thereafter, on 28 June 2012, the Annulment Request against the City of Prague was
presented, seeking the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07 on grounds of
substantive and procedural shortcomings.*? In particular, the complainants alleged that the
Zoning Plan Change:

- Did not respect the high-speed rail VR1 and the railway corridor that would run through
the Project Area;*>*

- Failed to respect protected natural areas and impaired the green belt surrounding
Prague;***

- Created a new zone of supra-local significance, which had no support in the Prague
Spatial Development Principles;**>

- Defined a new developable area, without sufficient assessment of the need for new
construction zones according to Section 55(3) of the Building Act 2006;*°°

The Botié-Miligov nature park was affected by Change Z 1294/07 and it had been
established as a “construction freeze” area;*”

Change Z 1294/07 created a new developable area, but failed to demonstrate that the
already delimited developable areas could not be used and it was, thus, in violation of the
Building Act;368

The area subject to Change Z 1294/07 was a “zone of supra-local significance”, since it
affected more than one Municipality, and therefore the re-zoning required the amendment
of the Spatial Development Principles (and not just the zoning plan);*° and

Change Z 1294/07 did not demonstrate its compliance with the Prague-BeneSov-Ceské
Budéjovice railway corridor, established both in the Spatial Development Policy and
Spatial Development Principles.*”°

The Court additionally determined that the proceedings had been procedurally flawed,
because the transfer from “wave 06” to “wave 07” had not been properly publicised.*”!

Decision of the Prague Supreme Administrative Court

Initially, the Mayor of Prague, Mr. Toma’ Hudeéek, stated publicly that the City of Prague
would not file a cassation complaint to the Prague Supreme Administrative Court.”
However, the City did eventually file a cassation complaint,*”* which was dismissed by the
Supreme Administrative Court one year later, on 26 February 2014, thus confirming the
annulment of the Zoning Change.*”*

Decision

Under Czech law, the approval of a zoning change in Prague entails a long and democratic
administrative process, divided into several consecutive steps, which culminates in a
Measure of General Nature adopted by the Prague City Assembly (the highest political body,
elected by the citizens of Prague).*’> But this political decision is not final: it is subject to
review by the Courts, which are authorised to scrutinise the procedure and the content in
order to safeguard that no breach of law has been committed.

This is precisely what happened in the present case: the Zoning Plan Change was approved
by Prague’s City Assembly. Thereafter, two private individuals, owners of properties
directly affected by the Project, and the District of Benice, the Borough where the Project
was located, filed a challenge against the approval before the Municipal Court. The District

was duly authorised to participate by a decision passed by the District Assembly — its highest
political body.*”° In due course, the Municipal Court issued its judgment, accepting that the
complainants had proper standing to file the case, and, on the merits, finding that the Zoning
Plan Change should be annulled

= because it had been issued in contravention of Czech law and,
- furthermore, because it lacked proper reasoning.*””

387. The first instance decision of the Municipal Court was eventually confirmed by the Supreme
Administrative Court.

The judgments do not infringe Article 4 of the BIT ...

388. Claimants do not contend that the judgments of the Municipal Court and of the Supreme
Administrative Court constitute a denial of justice. Absent an allegation of denial of justice,
the Zoning Plan Change must be deemed properly annulled, and the judgments rendered by
the Municipal Court and by the Supreme Administrative Court cannot, and do not, constitute
a breach of Article 4 of the BIT.

... nor does the decision of the District to file the Annulment Request

389. The decision by the District of Benice to file the Annulment Request does not result in a
violation of the BIT either.

390. The system of checks and balances developed by Czech law worked as any investor could
and should have expected: the political decision of the Prague City Assembly was
conditional upon review as to its legality by the Czech Courts. Any aggrieved party had the
right to request such review. Two affected citizens plus the District of Benice did so. The
District acted under the instruction of its highest organ, the Assembly; it exercised its legal
right to challenge the Zoning Plan Change, and it did so adhering to proper administrative
procedure.

purpose;*° legal process was used for a purpose for which it was not intended, in violation
of the FET standard.**°

The Tribunal is not persuaded by that argument.

Pro memoria: in 2002 the Districts of Benice and Uhiinéves, upon approval of their
respective District Assemblies, had initiated the administrative procedure for the Zoning
Plan Change. Eight years later, in 2010, the procedure had culminated in political approval
by the Prague City Assembly. The decision of the District Assembly of Benice, which
authorised the filing of the Annulment Request, was adopted in June 2012 — ten years after
the initial decision to proceed. Since District Assemblies are elected democratically, it is
likely that the composition of the Benice Assembly had undergone significant changes
between the initial decision to proceed and the final decision to seek annulment of the Zoning
Plan Change.

Claimants say that the decision to file the Annulment Request was a personal decision of
Mayor Topiéova, adopted as a retaliation for Claimants’ refusal to pay the additional sums
that she had sought to extract from them.

If this were indeed the case, such conduct could constitute a breach of the FET standard
enshrined in Article 4 of the BIT.

There are, however, three reasons which undermine Claimants’ argument:

First, the decision to file the Annulment Request was taken by the democratic organ of the
District of Benice, its Assembly, not by Mayor Topicova singlehandedly; there is no
evidence that the Assembly was aware of Mayor Topicova’s unsuccessful efforts to extract
funds from the developer and there is no evidence that the Assembly’s motives were to
retaliate against the investor;

Second, the Assembly justified its decision with the following arguments:

 

“To prevent the execution of the submitted Benice Residential Complex project or at
least to minimise its scale to a level that will not constitute a significant traffic growth
in the area, will not disrupt aesthetic and natural features of value of the Botié-Mili¢ov
nature park, and will not be an urbanistically and socially disproportionate intervention
in the development of Prague — Benice borough.”**!

The justification rings true. The construction of a new, very large, housing estate is often

an unwelcome development for existing home-owners, who fear a deterioration of the
environment and a reduction in the quality of public services;

402.

Third, the subsequent judgments rendered by the Courts retroactively justified the
District’s decision: the Zoning Plan Change was indeed held to be illegal and lacking in
proper reasoning, as the District had been claiming.

 

b. Second counterargument
Claimants submit a second counterargument.

Claimants say that even if the Tribunal were to find that Benice had a legitimate reason to
oppose the Project, the filing of an Annulment Request should still be considered a
disproportionate measure in light of available alternatives (such as seeking to reduce the
scope of the Project),*** and was thus a violation of the FET standard.*** Further, since
Benice acted to destroy Claimants’ investment without providing any advance notice, this

also violated the FET standard’s transparency requirement.***

Claimants rely on the opinion of their legal expert, Dr. Tomoszkova. In her second report,
Dr. Tomoszkova says that Benice could have used any of the many rights that city Districts
have to object to, or at least influence, the scale of a building project:*** Benice did not
comment on or object to the Zoning Plan Change,**° thus missing several opportunities to
influence the scale of the Project and in 2011, it did not even object to the increase in the
density coefficient. Dr. Tomoszkova also suggests**” that Benice could have limited its
request to the annulment of the increase in the density coefficient, without asking for the
annulment of the totality of the Zoning Plan Change.

In the course of the hearing, Mayor Topiéova contradicted Dr. Tomoszkova’s assertions. She
explained that in her view, the only way to prevent the impact of the Project on the Benice
borough was to file for the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change in its totality; if the Zoning
Plan Change remained in force, and the permits process was authorised to commence, Benice
would have had no opportunity to minimise the Project’s impact on the municipality and its
inhabitants***:

“MS TOPICOVA: Because we did not manage to negotiate a reduction in the size of
the project to a level that would be acceptable to us as the borough, we were looking for
a solution how to cancel the project. [...]

PROF DASSER: [...] Now, I just heard you say that your goal was to prevent the
project. What was the goal when you decided to annul the filed lawsuit?

MS TOPICOVA: I think I answered the question. We did not manage to reduce the
scope that would be acceptable to our municipality.

PROF DASSER: So, at the end of paragraph 29, what you really wanted to say was that
the consensual goal was now to prevent the development, is that what you are now
saying?

MS TOPICOVA: Yes, to prevent the size of the project. We did not find any other way.”

The Tribunal accepts Dr. Tomoszkova’s conclusion that the District could have been more
vocal in its opposition, and that alternative courses of action may have been available, such
that the challenge could have been limited to certain aspects of the Project. But these
hypothetical alternatives cannot detract from an undisputed fact: the Zoning Plan Change
did indeed breach Czech law, as confirmed by the decisions of the Courts. The District’s
decision to challenge it was a decision taken in observance of proper procedures and in
conformity with the rule of law. Such a decision (or a proper and regular judgment ruling
upon it) cannot be labelled as disproportionate, arbitrary or unreasonable, or in breach of the
FET standard.

Advance notice

The Tribunal does not accept Claimant’s subsidiary argument that Benice failed to provide
advance notice, in violation of the FET standard’s transparency requirement.

Projekt Sever was in due course informed, through a notification sent by the Municipal Court
on 25 July 2012, that the District had filed the Annulment Request. However, by the time
Projekt Sever attempted to participate in the proceedings in March 2013, the applicable legal
deadline to appear had lapsed, and the Court denied Projekt Sever’s request.**? Projekt Sever
challenged the decision of the Municipal Court, but on 4 December 2014 the Constitutional
Court confirmed the Municipal Court’s decision and dismissed the complaint.*”°

The Tribunal sees no violation of the FET standard. Public authorities are not under an
obligation to provide advance notice of their intention to launch lawsuits which affect
protected investors; what due process requires is that the respondent in a lawsuit be properly
notified, and that the respondent be afforded a reasonable time within which to appear.

These requirements were met: when the Annulment Request was filed, Projekt Sever was
duly notified through the Court. For reasons which are not to be imputed to Respondent,
Projekt Sever then failed to appear within the time frame established by Czech procedural
law. Its subsequent request, filed once the time period for appearance had already lapsed,
was denied. Projekt Sever appealed the decision up to the Constitutional Court, but it was
unsuccessful.

Claimants are not submitting that the decision of the Constitutional Court implied a denial
of justice.

. In the absence of any such allegation, much less any evidence of a denial of justice, the
Tribunal concludes that there is no breach of Article 4 of the BIT.

MAYOR HUDECEK’S OPPOSITION TO RE-PROCUREMENT

According to Claimants, the City of Prague could have re-procured the annulled Zoning Plan
Change promptly, there being no substantive reason why the deficiencies identified by the
Court in its Annulment Decision could not have been remedied; all that was required was
the drafting of a more detailed substantiation and obtaining an approval by the City
Assembly.*?! Instead, Claimants say that Mayor Hudeéek did not advance the re-
procurement during his term in office, and his conduct was unreasonable and arbitrary, in
breach of Article 4 of the BIT.

Respondent denies that Mayor Hudeéek engaged in improper conduct and avers that he
followed standard procedure in addressing the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change.**?

The Tribunal will again summarise the proven facts relevant to this issue [A.]. It will then
take a decision [B.] leading to its conclusion that Claimants’ counterarguments should be
dismissed [C.].

Proven facts

Two months after the Cassation Decision, Mr. Pawlowski (representing Projekt Sever) sent
a letter to Mayor Hudeéek. He stated that the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change had
caused massive damage to Projekt Sever (quantified at a minimum of CZK 2.5 billion) and
he requested that the matter be included in the agenda of the next session of the City
Assembly.*?* Projekt Sever sent another letter in May 2014 to Prague’s Zoning Plan
Division, citing the City’s obligations under Section 55(3) of Building Act and requesting
that the City Assembly continue the process of re-procuring Zoning Plan Change Z-
1294/07.3°4

A few days later, on 19 May 2014, Mayor Hudeéek reacted, informing Projekt Sever that
Section 55(3) did not apply to this case and that the only possible course of action was the
filing of a new application for a zoning plan change.**> Mayor Hudeéek explained that any
such instigation of a zoning plan change could originate from the original applicants (in this
case, the two Municipal Districts), but he also noted that if Projekt Sever applied for the
Zoning Plan Change itself, discussion of the Zoning Plan Change could be commenced, but
it would only apply to Projekt Sever.*°°

Meeting at the Spatial Development Division

Mr. Novacek, a Municipal lawyer working for the City Spatial Development Division,
participated in a meeting held around the same time, involving Mr. Pawlowski, his lawyers,
and civil servants from that Division.**” Mr. Novacek describes the meeting in the following
terms:

“T did not sense any effort on the part of Prague City Hall to support the project or the
zoning plan change itself: it was kind of like ‘it’s happened, nothing we can do about
it’. In response to an enquiry from Mr Pawlowski, a reply was sent saying that the
annulment of the change automatically restored the previous state of regulation. In other
cases where a zoning plan change was annulled, a possible solution was proactively
offered; only in this case that did not happen. The only option the City of Prague offered
Mr Pawlowski at this meeting was that he himself could ask for a new zoning plan
application to be processed.” *”*

Mr Novaéek recalled that this treatment contrasted with that granted to other investors in
equivalent situations:

“T remember that many equivalent meetings were also held with other investors if
zoning plan changes or modifications were annulled by a court. We usually discussed
the situation that had arisen with the investor and offered a solution, which consisted in
are-submission of the application, with the understanding that in the new processing of
the application we would eliminate the errors identified by the court as the grounds for
annulment.” *”

During the Hearing, Mr. Novaéek was questioned about what would normally happen when
a zoning plan change was annulled by a Court. He stated that:

“[T]here would be a meeting with the investor, the land owner. It would be explained
to him what was the cause of the annulment of the zoning plan change, what are the
reasons, and he would be asked whether he wants to insist on the change. If he says yes,
then we take a step or two back; we go back to the point which is not covered by the
decision of the court; what was annulled would be processed again, and the change
could be adopted again.”*””

Mr. Novaéek clarified what he found to be “non-standard” about the procedure applied to
Projekt Sever’s case. Rather than going back to the last valid step in the zoning process and
resuming from there, Mr. Novaéek explained:

“In this specific case it was requested that Mr Pawlowski make a new application
himself, and the change would be reprocessed from the very beginning again.”“”!

Discussion at the City Assembly Meeting of 29 May 2014

419. At the meeting of the Prague City Assembly on 29 May 2014 (10 days after Mayor
Hudeéek’s letter), Assembly member Dr. BlaZek asked Mayor Hudeéek about the delay in
bringing the matter of the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change before the Assembly, noting
the potential damages that the City of Prague was facing.*”* (To recall, Dr. Blazek was an
important figure in the “ODS” party, a political rival of Mayor Hudeéek’s “TOP09”
party),

420. Mayor Hudeéek responded by asserting that

“[t]he error is not in the administrative procedure [of the zoning change]; the error is
that the Prague City Assembly ever approved it.”

Allegations of improper conduct
421.

Mayor Hudeéek added that there had been improper conduct in obtaining the Zoning Plan
Change: the Zoning Plan Division initially had a negative opinion, and undue pressure had
been exerted to cause it to change its opinion. He also told the Assembly that files relating
to the approval of the Zoning Plan Change had been sent to the Police:*°°

“A zoning plan change was approved that conflicted with the Spatial Development
Principles at the time. The Institute of Urban Planning and Development, then known
as the Development Section, did not consent, but director Votava subsequently changed
the opinion to an affirmative one. That is documented. That was part of the ‘Blue Files’
and was sent to the police. The Railway Infrastructure Administration, as a concerned
state authority, did not consent. ROPIT did not consent. The Zoning Plan Division did
not consent, but then, under pressure from Councillor Manhart, had to change its
opinion, but even so the Prague City Assembly, which you were a part of, approved it
on 26 March 2010." [Emphasis added].

422. Mayor Hudeéek further insinuated that there had been criminality involved in the process.
Noting the City of Prague’s cassation appeal against the Municipal Court’s first instance
decision, Mayor Hudeéek stated:

“Tt is not true that we then did nothing. The City of Prague then filed a cassation
complaint against it for the very reason that the city could say ‘we did something’ in the
event of the kind of litigation that followed. I cannot say that I personally agree with the
cassation complaint. Not a bit. After what I read, it would be quite enough for me if

someone was locked up, not that it was discussed further. I remind you that the Prague
City Assembly that voted on it is the main argument.’“°” [Emphasis added].

4°3 Hudecek WS I, para. 16; Tomoszkova WS I, para. 78.

423. Mayor Hudeéek also referred to “legal opinions” supporting his view that the City had no
responsibility to act, and finally added:

“For that reason, if I were to summarise, the city did everything to ensure that any court
fine or arbitration was basically out of the question. At the same time Mr Pawlowski
wants us, as assembly members, to immediately start to issue a new zoning plan change.
To tell you the truth, having acquainted myself with it and after what I read here, I
personally cannot imagine that I personally would initiate that change. The change can
be initiated by a city borough, however. We have received no such instigation, so I think
that the Prague City Assembly literally has no work to do at this moment.”

Discussion at the City Assembly Meeting of 19 June 2014

424. One month later, at the 19 June 2014 City Assembly meeting, Dr. BlaZek once again brought
up the annulment of Change Z-1294/07. He proposed that the City restart the procurement
process, and he noted the potential future risks that the City Assembly members could face
if they did not act. Dr. Blazek proposed placing the matter on the agenda for full
discussion.“

425. In response to Dr. BlaZek’s concerns, Mayor Hudeéek replied that:

“Tf part of a zoning plan is annulled and there is no valid zoning plan in the given part
of the city or territory, the assembly has to act without delay. That means that we have
here the opinion of lawyers from the zoning plan division headed by Mrs. Engineer
Cvetlerova. Based on this opinion I think that we really don’t have to deal with this
situation now and consequently I won’t submit the prints either. I consequently will not
second Doctor BlaeZek’s motion.”"'° [Emphasis added].

426. Dr. Blazek responded to Mayor Hudeéek’s remarks, noting that he was:

“[G]lad that you say here that they are lawyers from the zoning plan division, which is
great, because four years ago the same lawyers, the same division, guaranteed the
Assembly here that everything is de lege, that everything is in order, and when the
Assembly voted on the change four years ago, we were persuaded and it was also drawn
up by this division, these lawyers, and I guess the same people, when we were told that
it is absolutely in order. Today, four years later, we are in a situation where it has been
annulled and so we are repeatedly being called on by the investor to act.”""!

427. Nevertheless, Mayor Hudeéek refused Dr. BlaZek’s motion to place the matter on the agenda
for discussion. Additionally, Mayor Hudeéek did not correct any of the statements made at
the 29 May 2014 meeting.

Discussion at the City Assembly Meeting of 11 September 2014

Three months later, at the 11 September 2014 meeting of the City Assembly, Dr. Blazek
accused Mayor Hudeéek of being motivated by personal animus against Mr. Pawlowski,
stating:

“Perhaps I even understand that you don’t like Mr Pawlowski. Personal feelings are a

fundamental driving force of your actions, but that’s all right. You will happily play it
down in six months’ time [...]”4!

Dr. Blazek also accused Mayor Hudeéek of having previously misled the City Assembly by
relying on a legal assessment which, he said, did not exist, and by having claimed that the
City Assembly acted under pressure from Councilor Manhart — who did not even know about
the Assembly meeting, nor the issues being discussed.*!*

Finally, Dr. Blazek questioned Mayor Hudeéek’s prior statements claiming reliance on a
legal opinion. Dr. Blazek asked Mayor Hudeéek:

“[E]xplain to me, please, when you said in June 2014 that it is evident, it is clear, on
the basis of legal assessments, why you didn’t submit a single legal assessment. It’s
because you didn’t have any: you had the opinion of the zoning plan division, that’s all
right. But I am just putting it out there and reminding you that that was the same division
that submitted its opinion to the assembly that [the zoning plan change] can be voted for
and that it is in order.’”*"* [Emphasis added].

 

       

 

In reply, Mayor Hudeéek noted that the land in question belonged to Mr. Pawlowski and he
alleged that Mr. Pawlowski was trying to force the Assembly to take up the issue of the re-
procurement.

Mayor Hudeéek insisted that he had commissioned a legal opinion, stating:

“So the legal opinion is here. That means that it is an opinion by the law firm of Calfa
BartoSik a partneii. [...] The only thing that was annulled is the discussion of a certain
zoning plan change. And here this by the law firm that originated in the
zoning plan division — it therefore does not follow from a simple linguistic interpretation
of the said provision that the Assembly’s obligation to decide without delay on the
procurement of the zoning plan or a change thereto and on its substance applies to the
case of the annulment of a change to a zoning plan or a part thereof.”*!> [Emphasis
added].

 

Mayor Hudeéek then once again urged the Assembly members not to give in to pressure
from Mr. Pawlowski, suggesting that all of Prague was against the Zoning Plan Change, and
questioning Dr. Blazek’s motivations for raising the issue:

“So, ladies and gentlemen, I recommend not yielding to the pressure from the investor
who is seeking the annulment of a zoning plan change against which that entire part of
Prague protested. And of course I understand Doctor Blazek, who is probably somehow
linked to this investor, but the law and the assessment state clearly that the necessity
does not follow.’”“'° [Emphasis added].

 

Projekt Sever files a complaint, alleging abuse of office

On 22 October 2014, Projekt Sever filed a criminal complaint (which was investigated by
the “Corruption and Financial Crime Detection Unit of the Czech Police”) against Mayor
Topiéova, Mayor Hudeéek, and other relevant persons. The complaint alleged, inter alia,
conspiracy and abuse of office by Mayor Topiéova and Mayor Hudeéek in seeking to annul
Change Z-1294/07 and blocking the construction of Claimants’ planned Residential
Complex.*!”

Ultimately, the police investigation did not proceed. Projekt Sever included in its
Constitutional Court challenge a complaint over the discontinuation of the police
investigation; the Constitutional Court, however, found all of Projekt Sever’s complaints
inadmissible.

Opinion of the Ministry of Regional Development

In the meantime, Mayor Coller of Uhiinéves had approached the Ministry of Regional

Development, requesting a legal opinion regarding the annulment of Zoning Plan Change Z-

1294/07. The Ministry reacted on 27 October 2014, with a letter addressed to Mayor Coller,

in which it explained the Ministry’s position:*!®

- First, the letter states that if a zoning plan change is annulled, the previous zoning
plan is applied;*!?

- Second, the letter explains that if the annulment is made because the proposed
change lacks reasoning, it is possible to remedy such shortcoming; the same applies
to procedural defects; if the annulment is for substantive reasons, the original

project will have to be modified to expunge the offending elements;*”°

- Third, Section 55(3) of the Building Act “imposes an obligation on the Municipal

Assembly to act in these extraordinary situations”;*”! it is the right and the duty of

the Assembly to assess the situation as it stands after the annulment and adopt the
proper decision, which must be duly substantiated;*??

- Fourth, the Ministry finally explains that it cannot “be ruled out that a Municipal
Assembly will decide, having weighed up all facts, that the state of affairs after the
annulment of the change is satisfactory and no change will be made.”*?

Summing up, the interpretation given by the Ministry to existing Czech legislation was that,
upon annulment of a zoning plan change, the matter must be submitted to the relevant
Municipal Assembly, which must assess the situation and adopt a reasoned decision:

- to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change (amending the shortcomings established in
the annulment judgment); or

- to confirm the annulment, in which case the previous zoning rules will apply.

Three months thereafter, in December 2014, the Ministry issued a “Methodological
Recommendation” regarding zoning plan changes,*** which confirmed that the proper
interpretation of Section 55(3) of the Building Act requires that, when a zoning plan change
is annulled, “the municipal assembly decides without delay on the procurement of the zoning
plan or of the change and on its substance.”

The re-procurement is finally tabled

In November 2014, Mayor Hudeéek’s term of office ended. At some unspecified time,
probably when Mayor Hudeéek was no longer Mayor, the City initiated the formal procedure
for re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change. The decision whether to re-procure or not
was finally placed on the agenda of the Prague City Assembly meeting of 14 April 2015,
when the Assembly decided to reject the re-procurement as will be analysed separately in
section [3.4] below).

Decision

The final Cassation Decision, annulling the Zoning Plan Change, was issued on 26 February
2014. The re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change was debated (and dismissed) by the
Prague City Assembly more than one year thereafter, on 14 April 2015. The Tribunal must
decide whether Mayor Hudeéek’s initial reluctance even to debate the re-procurement, based
on an interpretation of Section 55(3) of the Building Act, which led to a delay of more than
one year, was conduct that can be considered unreasonable, arbitrary or in contravention of
Article 4 of the BIT.

Section 55(3) of the Building Act

441. Partial or total annulment by the judiciary of a zoning plan change approved by a
Municipality is a frequent occurrence in the Czech Republic.*”° The Building Act has a
specific provision, establishing the principles which a Municipal authority must follow in
such cases. The precise wording of the Building Act has changed several times over the past
ten years. From | January 2013 to 31 December 2017, Section 55(3) of the Building Act
provided as follows:

“Tf a part of a zoning plan is annulled or it cannot serve as a ground for a decision
pursuant to Section 54 paras. 4 and 5, the municipal assembly shall without delay decide
on the procurement of the zoning plan or its change and its content. [...] If an entire
zoning plan is annulled, the process of procuring shall continue from the last action,
which was not challenged by the annulment.”*?’ [Emphasis added]

442. Projekt Sever argued that Section 55(3) required the Prague City Assembly to take up the
question of re-procurement without delay. That interpretation was initially contested by
Mayor Hudeéek and by the Municipality, which considered that Section 55(3) was only
applicable to zoning plans annulled in part or in their entirety, but not to the annulment of
zoning plan changes.*”* This construction was based on a literal reading of the law — the
Parties’ legal experts agree that from a textual perspective, Section 55(3) does not explicitly
refer to the annulment of a zoning plan change.*”?

443. Mr. Bohaé, who was the Director of Mayor Hudeéek’s office, explained in his witness
statement the background to Mayor Hudeéek’s opinion: while evaluating Mr. Pawlowski’s
case, the Mayor’s office had approached the Spatial Development Department. It had
received a written opinion, explaining that Section 55(3) of the Building Act dealt with a
situation in which a part of a zoning plan had been annulled, but it did not provide for a
situation, as in the case of the Project, where a change to an existing zoning plan had been
annulled.** Both Mayor Hudeéek**! and Mr. Bohaé**? aver that this was the regular practice
in dealing with zoning changes.‘

444. To settle the different interpretations of the law, Mayor Coller of Uhiinéves approached the
Ministry of Regional Development and asked for a legal opinion regarding the annulment of

Zoning Plan Change Z-1294/07. In October 2014, the Ministry issued its decision,
supporting Claimants’ interpretation.***

The City changes tack

The City accepted the Ministry’s interpretation, abandoned its prior position and initiated
the procedure for the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change. In April 2015, the decision
whether to accept or to dismiss the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change was submitted
to a vote by the City Assembly.

Since the City eventually instigated the procedure for re-procuring the Zoning Plan Change,
the complaint that Mayor Hudeéek’s conduct deprived Projekt Sever of the right to have the
Zoning Plan Change re-procured cannot be sustained. The only outstanding question is
whether the delay which occurred in instigating the re-procurement could give rise to a
breach of Article 4 of the BIT.

Delay

There was indeed a period of 14 months between the Cassation Decision (26 February 2014),
and the decision of the City Assembly on re-procurement (14 April 2015). But there are
circumstances which justify this delay: in all jurisdictions, zoning and re-zoning decisions
are lengthy procedures, requiring that different authorities with sometimes conflicting
mandates canvass and analyse the opinions of stakeholders and that environmental, social
and political factors be weighed.

In the present case, the Zoning Plan Change had been initiated by the Districts in 2006. It
had been approved by the Assembly in 2010 and annulled by the judiciary in 2014. It took
Mr. Pawlowski two months following the annulment to send his first communication to the
Municipality, requesting re-procurement. And it was October 2014 before the Ministry for
Regional Development informed the City that its interpretation was wrong, and that Section
55(3) should also be applied to the annulment of zoning changes. In December 2014, the
Ministry finally issued a “Methodological Recommendation” regarding zoning plan
changes, which confirmed the proper interpretation of Section 55(3) of the Building Act.**>
The decision of the Assembly was issued four months thereafter.

Under these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the delay in submitting the re-
procurement to the City Assembly was not so unreasonable as to constitute a breach of the
BIT and an international delict of the Czech Republic.

Claimants’ counterarguments

In reaching that decision the Tribunal has considered Claimants’ three counterarguments and
rejected them for the following reasons.

a. First counterargument

First, Claimants argue that Mayor Hudeéek, during his entire term in office, which ended in
November 2014, prevented the City from moving forward with the re-procurement;**° he
refused Claimants’ repeated requests to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change, even suggesting
that Claimants should start the process all over again and from the very beginning.**”

The Tribunal sees things differently.

It is true that Mayor Hudeéek supported a literal interpretation of Section 55(3) of the
Building Act, which eventually was abandoned by the Municipality, upon the
recommendation of the Ministry. It is also true that the Mayor left office in November 2014,
at a time when the re-procurement had still to be tabled before the Assembly. But from the
point of view of the international responsibility of the Czech Republic, what is relevant is
not the personal opinion of a single officer, but the fact that, within a period of time which
cannot be labelled as unreasonable, the City of Prague finally submitted the re-procurement
for approval by the City Assembly.

b. Second counterargument

Second, Claimants also assert that Mayor Hudeéek acted out of personal opposition to the
Zoning Plan Change and hostility to Mr. Pawlowski*** and made tendentious statements to
the Assembly.**?

The evidence does show that Mayor Hudeéek personally opposed the initial approval of the
Zoning Plan Change and that on several occasions he made inaccurate statements before the
City Assembly.

Personal opposition

There can be no doubt that Mayor Hudeéek personally opposed the development of the
Project in general, and the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change in particular. But
opinions are free: that a political representative holds the view that a certain real estate
development is not in the interest of the City by itself does not give rise to an international
delict of the Czech Republic.

Inaccurate statements
457. Did Mayor Hudeéek make inaccurate statements to the City Assembly?

458. At the meeting of the Prague City Assembly on 29 May 2014, Mayor Hudeéek suggested
that there had been improper conduct in obtaining the Zoning Plan Change and that
Councillor Manhart had exercised undue pressure. He also told the Assembly that files
relating to the approval of the zoning change had been sent to the Police and further
insinuated that there had been criminality involved.*#!

459. In direct contradiction to his statements made before the City Assembly, Mayor Hudeéek
later admitted that no Police investigation had actually taken place. In a letter dated 5 August
2014 addressed to Mrs. KubeSova, a member of the Committee of Bonum Commune, Mayor
Hudeéek explained that no representations had been made to the criminal justice
authorities” and he corrected his statement with respect to Councilor Manhart having
exercised undue pressure.*#?

460. During the hearing, Mayor Hudeéek provided additional information: the files had in fact
been sent to the police, because he had found irregularities in the documents submitted for
the approval of the Zoning Plan Change. Such irregularities included multiple instances of
amendments to documents which had previously been marked “for this reason we disagree.”
The original notation had been crossed out and replaced with “we agree” and signed by
Director Votava.**4 Ultimately, however, the Police determined that there was insufficient
proof of any wrongdoing and the investigation was dropped.”

 

  

461. The record seems to bear out the fact that at the 29 April 2014 Assembly meeting, Mayor
Hudeéek’s statements regarding the alleged illegality of Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07,

440 City Assembly Meeting Transcript, 29 May 2014, p. 2, C-96: “A zoning plan change was approved that conflicted

Administration, as a concerned state authority, did not consent. ROPIT did not consent. The Zoning Plan Division did
not consent, but then, under pressure from Councillor Manhart, had to change its opinion, but even so the Prague City
Assembly, which you were a part of, approved it on 26 March 2010.” [Emphasis added].

Prague then filed a cassation complaint against it for the very reason that the city could say ‘we did something’ in the
event of the kind of litigation that followed. I cannot say that I personally agree with the cassation complaint. Not a
bit. After what I read, it would be quite enough for me if someone was locked up, not that it was discussed further. I
remind you that the Prague City Assembly that voted on it is the main argument.” [Emphasis added].

ethical and political, not unlawful.” [Emphasis added].

erroneously mixed up his name with the name of the former councilor for spatial development in the years 2007 —

even if not outright false (the City had indeed sent certain files for the Police to investigate),
were at least inaccurate and exaggerated (because Councillor Manhart was not involved, and
no criminality was found).

Mayor Hudeéek’s conduct cannot be lauded. There are however certain mitigating factors to
consider:

The 29 April 2019 discussion in the Prague Assembly was of a political character; no
specific resolution with regard to the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change was
tabled or discussed. The re-procurement was only put on the agenda of, and discussed in,
the Assembly on 14 April 2015, almost one year thereafter (at a time when Mayor Hudeéek
was no longer in office).

Mayor Hudeéek explained at the Hearing that his statements were part of a political
446

strategy necessary to survive at the City Assembly:
“TA]t the Assembly I act as leader of the ruling coalition, and I have to make sure that
the procedure agreed, or order agreed by the coalition is maintained. So anyone, even
Mr BlaZek -- and if you are not a politician you may find this odd -- Mr Blazek is not
saying that it should be included on the agenda; his purpose is that this is said there. If
he would like to include it on the agenda he would have approached me a week earlier
and we would have agreed to include on it the agenda. So on his part it is a bit of political
game, and it is up to me to play this political game as well as I can. So it is quite apparent
here that what I am saying here: ‘Mr Blazek, you are the causer of this change being
approved, in spite of the fact that here were a number of opinions saying no, this change
shouldn't have been approved’. And in this political game, I am smiling while I say this,
even though it is quite sad, but in this political game it is much easier to beat someone
over the head with this political argument, rather than bother the 65 Assembly members
with expert opinions and details, when they are bored and want to get on with voting.
In spite of that, when I see what I was saying, I think I actually did a good job, that there
is the explanation why the reason is what we say [...].”

HK

The Tribunal finds that position to be credible. Mayor Hudeéek’s stance opposing re-
procurement of the Zoning Plan Change was in essence motivated by political
considerations. He considered that the development would be detrimental to the future of the
City, and he vigorously defended his position at the City Assembly, a political body, using
the exaggerations and inaccuracies common in political speech. These exaggerations and
inaccuracies

- had no influence on the Assembly’s eventual decision to dismiss the re-
procurement of the Zoning Plan Change (a decision which was taken a year later,
when Mayor Hudeéek’s term had already come to an end) and

“6 HT 845:11-846:13; See also HT 838:16-839:3.

- did not constitute an offence under Czech municipal law (Claimants’ criminal
complaint having been dismissed).

In the Tribunal’s opinion, Mayor Hudeéek’s economies with the truth are not of such gravity
as to provoke an international delict on the part of the Czech Republic.

c. Third counterargument
Finally, Claimants make a third counterargument.

Claimants argue that rather than following standard procedure and requesting advice from
the appropriate Municipal authority, Mayor Hudeéek tasked a compliant law firm with
generating an opinion that supported his refusal to move forward with re-procurement.*”7

At the 29 May 2014 Assembly meeting, Mayor Hudeéek stated that he was relying on legal
assessment from the law firm Calfa, Barto8ik a partnefi. But the evidentiary record
demonstrates that such legal opinion was only commissioned and issued at a much later date.
A letter from the Director of the Building and Zoning Plan Division to Projekt Sever
establishes that the legal opinion was commissioned on 23 June 2014 and delivered on 30
July 2014:

“[W]e are sending you a copy of the legal assessment of 30 June 2014 done by the law
firm of Calfa, BartoSik a partneii; [...]

Re 3) the assessment was commissioned on 23 June 2014

Re 4) the said was handed over by employees of the law firm on 30 July
2014 (see submission stamp of the copy of the assessment).”““* [Emphasis added].

This letter confirms Dr. Blazek’s final remarks directed to Mayor Hudeéek during an
Assembly Meeting, where Dr. Blazek stated:

“You [Mayor Hudeéek] commissioned that legal opinion after the June Assembly
session, because you didn’t have one before then. That is a declaration, it is the truth, it
is a statement of fact.”*”

The record shows that Mayor Hudeéek made an untrue statement before the City Assembly:
he referred to an outside legal opinion which had yet to be commissioned and issued.

The inaccuracy is to be lamented. But an incidental inaccuracy by a public authority, in a
speech before a political body, which is not directly related to a protected investor or
investment, does not constitute a breach by the Czech Republic of the duty to refrain from
acting in an unreasonable manner, as required under Article 4 of the BIT.

THE ASSEMBLY’S DECISION NOT TO RE-PROCURE

Claimants argue that the decision of the Prague City Assembly dismissing the re-
procurement of the Zoning Plan Change was unreasonable, arbitrary and disproportionate.**°

Respondent counters that the Assembly acted in full compliance with Czech law, without
abuse or arbitrariness. *!

The Tribunal will first make a summary of the relevant facts [A.], explain its decision [B.],
and dismiss Claimants’ counterarguments [C.].

Proven facts

The re-procurement of Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07 was finally placed on the agenda for
the Prague City Assembly meeting of 14 April 2015. The Assembly was presented with an
extensive summary of the underlying facts, including a reference to the letter of the Ministry
of Regional Affairs dated 27 October 2014, and with two alternatives from which it had to
choose:

- to consent to continuation of the re-procurement or
i ination 452
- to consent to its termination.

Deputy Mayor Stropnicky made a short introductory remark, acknowledging that the City
Assembly “could comply with the Court’s recommendation” and “commence the
procurement of the change on the basis of the Court’s recommendations”, but he proposed
to the Assembly that the re-procurement be dismissed.**

Mayor Krnaéova then called for a vote.

The totality of the 51 members of the City Assembly members voted in favour of terminating
the procurement of Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07 (i.e., of dismissing the re-procurement);
not a single member of the Assembly voted against termination or abstained.*°+

Thus, on 14 April 2015, the Prague City Assembly finally terminated the procurement of
Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07 and the land purchased by Projekt Sever to develop the
Benice Residential Complex reverted to agricultural, forest and recreational use.

B. Decision

478. The issue before the Tribunal is whether the City of Prague, in deciding not to re-procure
Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07, acted unreasonably or arbitrarily in breach of Article 4 of
the BIT.

479. The Tribunal sees no unreasonable or arbitrary decision, nor a breach of the FET standard.

480. Section 55(3) of the Building Act — as interpreted in the 27 October 2014 letter from the
Ministry of Regional Development — imposes an obligation on the Municipal Assembly to
act when a zoning change plan has been annulled by the Courts;**> but the City Assembly is
empowered to assess the new situation and adopt the most appropriate decision.**° As the
Ministry acknowledged, it cannot “be ruled out that a municipal assembly will decide,
having weighed up all facts, that the state of affairs after the annulment of the change is
satisfactory and no change will be made.”*>’ The only requirement which the Assembly must
meet is that its decision must be substantiated.

481. In accordance with Section 55(3), the City of Prague Assembly, faced with the decision of
the Courts to annul the Zoning Plan Change, was under an obligation to review the situation
without unreasonable delay, and, after weighing up all facts, to issue a discretionary decision
either re-procuring the Zoning Plan Change, with the modifications necessary to satisfy the
Court ruling, or terminating the procurement. To avoid arbitrariness, the decision had to be
“duly substantiated” or “informed”, i.e., properly reasoned, weighing all countervailing
factors.4°8

482. Mr. Langmajer (who was Deputy Mayor of Uhiinéves and who appeared as a witness for
Claimants) acknowledged that the decision of the Assembly “can be positive or negative.”*°?

Proper substantiation

483. When asked at the Hearing about the standard under Czech law by which a decision may be
deemed to be substantiated or informed, Dr. Tomoszkova, Claimants’ legal expert, referred
the Tribunal to her legal opinion.*™ It states that the Assembly was required to:

“(1) [...] assess the nature of the defect for which the zoning change was annulled, to
evaluate the impacts of the City Court’s decision on the conceptual design of the Prague
Land Use Plan, and to consider its consequences, including its impact on the legitimate
expectations of any affected persons. [...]”“°!

a statement which

485. In the present case, the decision of the City Assembly to terminate the procurement of the

Zoning Plan Change included the following reasoning:

“— assent to termination

- one of the applicants for the change filed an action against the issued zoning plan
change and expresses no interest in new procurement after its annulment by the court

- the new procurement would take place against the will of the relevant city borough as
the party that filed the action for the annulment of the zoning plan change

- the substantiation of the court judgment is of such a nature that the outcome of further
procurement of the change would be uncertain in terms of attaining compliance with the
court’s legal opinion

- the annulment of the change restored the territory to its original functional use, which
can form the basis for decision-making in the territory at this moment; from the point of
view of consequences for the substance (conceptual solution) of the zoning plan, the
procurement of change Z 1294/07 is not essential

- Projekt Sever, s.r.o., as the owner of most of the land in the territory in question
demanding the continuation of the procurement of the zoning plan change on the
grounds of minimising the damages it has incurred, became the owner of the land at a
time when the procurement of Z 1294/07 had not been completed and its functional use
corresponded to the current functional use of the area in the zoning plan, i.e. the
functional use of the area after the annulment of the zoning plan change.”**

486. The Tribunal finds that the reasoning provided by the Assembly covers the most significant

487.

issues: it explains that the District of Benice, which had been one of the applicants of the
Zoning Plan Change, had at a later stage requested its judicial annulment, and now opposed
the possibility of re-procurement; that the re-procurement faced difficulties in trying to
comply with the deficiencies identified by the Court; that the land would be restored to its
original designated use under the zoning plan, the same use which had been applicable when
Projekt Sever had made the purchase.

The Tribunal also notes that the reasoning meets the requirements set forth by Dr.
Tomoszkova in her report:

- It assesses the nature of the defects, and concludes that it is “uncertain” whether

re-procurement could “[attain] compliance with the court’s legal opinion”;

464 Resolution of the Prague City

- It evaluates the impact on the conceptual design, explaining that the territory will
be restored to its “original functional design” and that the re-procurement is not
essential for the conceptual solution of the zoning plan;

- It considers the consequences, including the legitimate expectations of the affected
persons, pointing out that Projekt Sever had acquired the Project Area when the
zoning change had yet to be approved and that the land now had the same use than
it had at the time the investor acquired it,*+ adding that the developer could start
the procedure anew and provide better substantiation.“

Summing up, Claimants argue that the decision of the Prague City Assembly dismissing the
re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change was unreasonable, disproportionate and arbitrary.
The Tribunal disagrees. The unanimous decision of the Assembly to dismiss the proposal to
re-procure the Zoning Plan Change was properly substantiated and consequently it was a
reasoned decision, which did not breach the prohibition of unreasonable measures provided
for in Article 4 of the BIT.

Counterargument

In reaching that decision the Tribunal has considered Claimants’ counterargument and
rejects it for the following reasons.

Claimants argue that Deputy Mayor Stropnicky, who was responsible for spatial planning
issues at the City of Prague, made less than candid statements to the Assembly to ensure that
the re-procurement was not approved.*°

The facts do not support Claimants’ argument.

By early 2015, Deputy Mayor Stropnicky of the Green Party was responsible for spatial
planning issues in Prague, the area of the Municipality in charge of the re-procurement of
the Zoning Plan Change. In this capacity, he put the re-procurement on the agenda of the
Committee on Spatial Development meeting (on 15 February 2015) and of the City Council
(on 31 March 2015). The Council discussed the issue and instructed Deputy Mayor
Stropnicky to submit the matter to the Assembly, with the recommendation that the
Assembly vote to dismiss the re-procurement.*”

Immediately thereafter, the City published a press release, stating that the City Council had
proposed that the Assembly should not re-procure Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07. In the
release, entitled “Sebastian Pawlowski’s big residential complex between Benice and
Uhfinéves is not going to happen”, Deputy Mayor Stropnicky is quoted as saying:

“This means that the intent for a residential complex in this location is cancelled. At the
same type this is a systemic step. The practice ends where developers speculate on the

purchase of cheap farmland and afterwards claw back from the City the change to
lucrative land for construction. Who buys farm land will have farm land [...].”“*

494. He then added:

“The majority owner of the land of the zoning change (Z-1294/07), the company Projekt
Sever s.r.0 was informed about the court decision. At the same time the company was
asked, should it wish a new procurement, to request this through the City borough
concerned. [...] The owner is threatening with arbitration for lost investment but the
City Council did not react to the threat. There is no legal right to have the zoning
changed.”

495. Two weeks later, on 14 April 2015, the re-procurement was tabled on the agenda of the
Prague Assembly, and Deputy Mayor Stropnicky presented the matter making a short
introduction:

“This is about the relatively well-known land belonging to Projekt Sever, which is
owned by the well-known businessman Sebastian Pawlowski, and it is about land plots,
which were bought as a field and the owner of the land has afterwards sought to have
the land judicially transformed into building land, which we judged to be unacceptable
pressure; there is no legal entitlement to the procurement of zoning plan changes. [...]

We therefore propose that the termination of the procurement of this change be
approved. I would add that the change was annulled by a court, but we could now
actually comply with the court’s observations, recommended in respect of this change,
and we could commence the procurement of the change again, on the basis of the court’s
recommendations.

However, I do not propose that we pay any more attention to this change. I propose that
we do not procure it at all, ie. I propose that the termination of the procurement of this
change be approved.”*?

496. After this short speech, the debate was opened. Only one Assembly member took the floor,
to state, in a two-line declaration, that he fully agreed with the proposal to dismiss. Thereafter
the vote was taken, resulting in a 51:0 result in favour of dismissing re-procurement.

Discussion

497. The record establishes that Deputy Mayor Stropnicky was firmly opposed to the possibility
of re-procuring the Zoning Plan Change. But it does not show that he made false statements
in the press release (i) or that he ‘manipulated’ the Assembly (ii).

498. (i) Claimants take issue with the fact that in the quote included in the press release, the
Deputy Mayor stated that developers speculate by buying “cheap farmland”, while Projekt

Sever had bought the land from the Ministry of Defense, the Municipality and from private
landowners at a price which exceeded that for farmland.

The criticism is misguided: Claimants bought the land for an average price of CZK 1,253
per sqm, which is well below the maximum prices paid for developed land, which could
reach CZK 2,900 per m’, as confirmed by Claimants’ valuation expert, Mr. Karl Schumacher
of AlixPartners:

“The Claimants’ site was prospective building land and priced accordingly; the
Claimants paid an average price of about CZK 1,253 per sqm. As a comparison,
according to Respondent’s data, in 2007 the official prices for already developed land
(with buildings and infrastructure) in the larger area around Claimants’ site most often
ranged from CZK 510 per sqm to CZK 2,900 per sqm.” *””

(ii) Deputy Mayor Stropnicky’s words before the Assembly can also not be faulted. He
expressed his preference for the Assembly to dismiss the re-procurement option, but he also
explained that the alternative to continue with the procurement, abiding by the Court
Decision, was available. The Assembly unanimously voted for the first alternative.

The Tribunal sees no “manipulation.”
BENICE’S OPPOSITION TO THE RE-PROCUREMENT

Claimants finally submit that Benice’s insistence, after the Annulment Decision, that there
should be no re-procurement was highly unusual, unreasonable and disproportionate to
achieve its policy aims.*7!

Respondent rejects the notion that it was unheard of for a municipality to propose and later
challenge the same zoning plan change. To the contrary, Respondent argues that in the course
of zoning plan changes, a long and democratic process, it is in fact a frequent occurrence
that a borough, after having applied for a zoning change, then changes its mind and
withdraws the application(s).4”

Discussion

The underlying facts are straightforward: In the spring of 2015, when the Prague City finally
took up the issue whether to re-procure Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07, a representative of
Benice attended the Prague City Council where the issue was being discussed and insisted
that Benice was opposed to re-procurement.*”

Districts have a very limited role in the re-procurement of a zoning plan change which has
been annulled by the Courts. The decision must be taken by the Prague City Assembly, upon
a proposal of the Council. In this case a representative of the District was invited to attend
the Council, and there expressed the District’s position that the re-procurement should be

rejected.*”4 In his speech before the Assembly, Deputy Mayor Stropnicky then publicly
stated that the District did not agree with the re-procurement (as was the case).*”>

506. There is no evidence that Benice’s opposition to the re-procurement swayed the (unanimous)
decision of the City Assembly. But even if it had, the District’s conduct in this case could
not constitute a breach of the BIT. The District took the position that the Zoning Plan Change
was illegal, and its position had been upheld by the Courts. When the possibility of re-
procurement was tabled, it was only coherent for the District to voice opposition.

VII.1.3. DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES

Claimants allege, and Respondent denies, that the Czech Republic breached the BIT’s
prohibition against “discriminatory measures” and “less favourable treatment” under
Articles 4(1) and 4(2), because it approved (and re-procured) zoning changes for other
projects while simultaneously terminating Claimants’ Project.

The Tribunal will summarize Claimants’ and Respondent’s position [1. and 2.] and then
adopt a decision [3.].

POSITION OF CLAIMANTS

Claimants say that Benice and the City of Prague singled out Claimants and prohibited the
Zoning Plan Change, while numerous other developers were authorised to construct new
residential complexes near Claimants’ Project Area.*”°

Claimants explain that they are in the same line of business as five other investors (Skanska,
CPI, Ekospol, Vivius, and Central Group), noting that these entities were all similarly placed
in the market and all were developing residential buildings in the immediate vicinity of
Prague during the same period of time.4””

Additionally, Claimants assert that it is sufficient if the investors themselves — and not
necessarily the investors’ projects — are comparable. Claimants argue that it is not necessary
to prove that all of the projects are of the same scale or are located in the exact same area.*”8

Claimants allege that both Benice [A.] and the City of Prague [B.] subjected Claimants and
their investments to discriminatory and less favorable treatment in violation of the BIT.

Benice’s conduct discriminated against Claimants

Claimants argue that Benice treated Claimants’ investment less favorably than it did other
investments. According to Claimants, at the same time as Claimants’ Project was being
destroyed, other zoning changes were being approved and permits were being granted which
allowed development of numerous projects by other investors in direct proximity to
Claimants’ Project Area. Claimants maintain that several companies in the immediate area
(Skanska, CPI, Ekospol, Vivius, and Central Group) received more favorable treatment than
they did.*”

Additionally, Claimants note that of those companies, only one (Skanska) is a non-Czech
company. According to Claimants, this suggests that Mr. Pawlowski was singled out in part
because he is a foreigner.**°

Claimants allege that Benice’s reasons for opposing Claimants’ Project are not legitimate
and reveal their less favorable treatment of Claimants’ investments. At the same time that
Benice acted to prevent Claimants’ Project, it did nothing to oppose a zoning change (Z-
1278) which converted an area of land designated for a kindergarten, a primary school and
a secondary school into an area zoned for the development of a multi-story hotel tower and
complex owned by a private investor.**!

The City of Prague treated Claimants less favorably

Claimants argue that by refusing to apply its standard procedure after the Annulment
Decision, the City of Prague treated Claimants less favorably than other investors, in
violation of Article 4(2) of the BIT.**?

According to Claimants, upon the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change, the normal course
of action would have been for the Zoning Plan Division promptly to remedy the deficiencies
identified by the Court, assuming that the applicant wanted to pursue the Zoning Plan
Change.**?

Claimants rely on the testimony of Dr. Novaéek, in which he explained that the City’s
decision to terminate the procurement of the Zoning Change Plan was political. Dr. Novaéek
also noted that while in other cases the City worked proactively with the developer to
eliminate errors identified by a court, it refused to do so in Claimants’ case.**4

Claimants allege that the City of Prague’s treatment of the Project was unique: it marked the
first time in the history of the Czech Republic that a zoning change was annulled for formal
reasons and not procured again, in a case in which the applicant required that the
procurement continue.**°

Claimants identify Central Group a.s. (“Central Group”) as one of the Czech developers
which was ina similar situation (having had its zoning plan change annulled) and which was
treated more favorably than Claimants by the City of Prague. According to Claimants, the
City repeatedly re-procured Central Group’s zoning plan change Z-1424/07, after it had been
annulled multiple times.**°

2. POSITION OF RESPONDENT

521.

Respondent rejects Claimants’ allegations and avers that the Czech Republic did not
discriminate against Claimants or treat their investments “less favorably” than those of
Czech investors.**”

522. Respondent asserts that Claimants have not identified an appropriate comparator upon which
to base their allegations of discrimination: it maintains that Claimants are required to identify
a Czech real estate developer, which had applied for a zoning plan change under conditions
substantively similar to those of Claimants. Respondent additionally notes that such
conditions include the size and location of the comparator project, and the applicant’s
conduct in the re-zoning process. ***

A.  Benice did not discriminate against Claimants

523. Respondent argues that Mr. Pawlowski’s Project was not singled out by Benice or by its
Mayor. Respondent notes that most of the projects referred to by Claimants are not within
Benice’s territory, and Benice therefore could not have opposed them.**?

524. With respect to the two projects within Benice, Respondent argues that they are not relevant
comparators, because Claimants have not shown that they belonged to Czech investors, and
so they are irrelevant to Claimants’ discrimination claims based on national treatment.
Additionally, Respondent notes that the two projects were vastly different from Claimants’
project in terms of their size: one of the projects comprised 49 low-rise houses and the other
comprised a single hotel building with less than 50 rooms. Claimants’ Project, in contrast,
would have added 4,000 permanent residents to an area currently housing 500 residents.*”°

B. The City of Prague did not discriminate against Claimants

525. Respondents also reject Claimants’ allegation that the City of Prague discriminated against
Claimants or their Project. The decision to terminate the re-procurement complied with
Czech law, was thoroughly justified, and was not impacted by the fact that Mr. Pawlowski
was a foreigner.*?!

526. Respondent adds that none of the other developers to which Claimants refer was in a situation
similar to that of Claimants or their Project. Respondent explains that of the developers to

which Claimants refer, only one, Central Group, had its zoning change annulled by the Czech
courts and later re-procured.*””

527. Respondent notes that Central Group is a Cypriot company, and it should not therefore
impact on Claimants’ national treatment claim.**? Additionally, Respondent explains that
the land impacted by Central Group’s project comprised a far smaller area than that affected
by Claimants’ project.4* Respondent emphasises a further distinction: following the
annulment of the zoning change affecting Central Group’s project, Central Group itself
swiftly applied for its re-procurement. Respondent notes that in this case, Claimants were
entitled to apply for the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change, but they chose not to do

528. Finally, Respondent argues that even if Claimants had identified an appropriate comparator,
any alleged difference in treatment was justified by the particularities of each zoning change.
According to Respondent, tribunals have consistently found that reasonable distinctions
between domestic and foreign investors do not constitute a breach of the national treatment
standard.‘°°

3. DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

529. Claimants argue that the Prague Municipality discriminated against them and treated their
investment less favorably than the investments of other domestic and foreign investors:
during the relevant time period, other zoning changes were approved and permits were
granted, which allowed the development of numerous projects by other investors in direct
proximity to Claimants’ Project Area. Furthermore, Claimants argue that by refusing to
follow its standard procedure after the Annulment Decision, the City of Prague treated
Claimants less favorably than other investors, in violation of Article 4(2) of the BIT.*””

530. Respondent denies any discrimination or less favourable treatment to Claimants’ detriment:
Claimants’ Project was not singled out by Benice or its Mayor and the Prague City
Assembly’s decision to terminate the re-procurement was in compliance with Czech law,
was justified and was not influenced by the fact that Mr. Pawlowski was a foreigner.*°*
Discrimination

531.

Article 4(1) of the BIT prohibits “discriminatory measures”, which impair the use or
enjoyment of a protected investment. Discrimination is a relative standard, which requires a
comparative analysis between measures applied to the protected investment and measures
applied to other investments in similar situations.

Article 4(2) defines the NT and MEN standards, which prohibit discrimination based on
nationality: the Czech Republic may not subject protected investors or their investments to
treatment which is “less favourable” than that accorded to investments owned by other
investors — either Czech or from other countries. To establish that the treatment effectively
is “less favourable”, a comparator in like circumstances must be defined.*”?

It is also widely accepted that there must be no objective reason which justifies the
differential treatment.>°°

Summing up, if a claim based on discrimination or breach of the NT and MEN standards is
to succeed, the following three-pronged test must be satisfied:

- First, an appropriate comparator must be identified, i.e., an investor which is in a situation

similar to that of Claimants (or an investment which is in a situation similar to Claimants’
investment in the Czech Republic);*"!

 

- Second, Claimant must prove that the Czech Republic has applied to this comparator a

treatment more favourable than that accorded to Pawlowski AG and Projekt Sever, or to
their investment in the Czech Republic;

- Third, there must be a lack of a reasonable or objective justification for the difference of

treatment.*°?
The burden of proving these three elements lies with Claimants.
Discussion

Claimants argue that Mr. Pawlowski was singled out because he was a foreigner,*°? and that
at the same time that Claimants’ Project was being destroyed, other zoning changes were
being approved and permits were being granted, allowing the development of numerous
projects by other investors in direct proximity to Claimants’ Project Area. Claimants
specifically aver that several companies in the immediate area (Skanska, CPI, Ekospol,
Vivius, and Central Group) received more favorable treatment than Claimants themselves.>

The Tribunal accepts that several other residential projects in the surrounding area of the
Project were being promoted during the same period: in 2015 different real estate projects
were underway near the Claimants’ holdings, including projects being developed by the five
developers identified by Claimants.*°

538. But Claimants have not established that the treatment given to these investors was
discriminatory or in breach of the FT and MEN standards:

539. First, two of the aforementioned investors were Czech (Ekospol and Vivus), while the other
three were foreigners (Skanska is from Sweden, CPI Group is from Luxembourg, and
Central Group is owned and controlled by a Cypriot investor).°°° This fact alone is sufficient
to dispose of any notion that the Czech Republic singled out Mr. Pawlowski because he was
a foreigner, and there is no suggestion of any discrimination specifically against Swiss
investors.

540. Second, Claimants have failed to prove that the projects developed by these companies
constitute adequate comparators to the Residential Complex envisaged by the Claimants in
Benice:

- inthe case of Ekospol, the scale of the project (176 apartments)°°” is not comparable with

Claimants’ proposed Residential Complex with housing for 4,000 residents;

- CPI’s project, the only development located in Benice and owned by a foreign investor,

consisted in 49 low-rise houses;>°* again, that is not comparable with Claimants’ Project;

- Claimants have failed to provide further information on the Skanska and Vivus projects.

Central Group

541. As regards Central Group, the project was located in a different district of Prague
(Komorany, which is twice the size and has twice the population of Benice) and concerned
the re-zoning of an area eight times smaller than that of Claimants’ Project.° In 2009,
Central Group had bought agricultural land in the district of Komorany, which was
undergoing a zoning change procurement process. Central Group, much like Projekt Sever,
invested while awaiting the completion of a zoning plan change (“Z-1424/07”).5'°

542. After the approval of zoning change Z-1424/07, Central Group initiated the planning permit
procedure. In 2013 the District Prague 12 filed an action before the City Court requesting
annulment. The City Court annulled zoning change Z-1424/07 on 5 February 2014, due to
insufficient substantiation of the density coefficient increase and insufficient public
discussion. The Supreme Administrative Court upheld the decision on 24 October 2014.>!!

543. Upon annulment of its zoning change, Central Group applied for re-procurement, but it did
so on the basis that it withdrew its prior request for increase in the density coefficient (the
cause of the annulment).>!? The Prague Municipality prepared a new substantiation and held

a new public discussion. Thereafter, zoning change Z-1424/07 was approved by the Prague
City Assembly for the second time on 15 September 2016.5"

544. In 2017, the zoning change was challenged again, this time by the civic association “Spolek

pro Komoafany” and by a private citizen. Despite a better substantiation, on 20 June 2017
the City Court annulled the zoning change once again for other deficits in the
substantiation.*'4 The re-procurement process was again initiated*'> and on 19 September
2019 the Prague City Assembly approved the re-procurement of zoning change Z-1424/07
for the third time.*!°

545. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Claimants’ expert that the case of Central Group shows

that the Prague City Assembly is authorised to re-procure an annulled zoning change.*!’ But
this is beside the point. The fact that Central Group’s zoning change was annulled and re-
procured twice does not make the case comparable to Claimants’, there being significant
differences between both:

- The grounds on which the Czech Courts based their decisions to annul the respective
zoning plan changes are different: Projekt Sever’s Zoning Plan Change (Z-1294/07) was
annulled because it had been approved in contravention of the law and lacked proper
reasoning, while Central Group’s zoning change Z-1424/07 was annulled only for formal
reasons (deficit of substantiation);>!*

- The reaction of the two developers was also different: upon annulment of its zoning
change, Central Group voluntarily withdrew its prior request to increase the density
coefficient and applied for re-procurement, while Claimants never changed the scope of
the Residential Complex and never formally applied for the initiation of a new
procurement procedure.*!?

546, But even assuming arguendo that Central Group was a suitable comparator, Claimants’

allegation of discrimination would still fail, because there may be valid reasons which justify
the difference in treatment. Investment tribunals have consistently held that reasonable
distinctions between domestic and foreign investors do not imply discrimination.>”°
Furthermore, the threshold applied to establish whether a State’s conduct was justified has
been low.*?!

547. In establishing and amending zoning rules, municipal authorities take into consideration a

513

variety of geographical, environmental and social reasons, and in weighing these factors they
must enjoy a certain margin of discretion. The authorisation granted to develop a certain plot
of agricultural land situated in Prague Komorany, does not of itself imply discrimination

against Projekt Sever if its agricultural land in Benice is denied similar treatment; each
project has its own characteristics, each project is situated in another environment and these
differences can legitimately influence the authorities’ decision.

In the present case, the Czech Courts found that Claimants’ Project in Benice was contrary
to the law, because it

- affected the Boti¢-Miliéov nature park and was located in a “construction freeze” area;

- was located in a zone of supra-local significance and required amendment of the Spatial
Development Principles;

- was situated on, or close to, the Prague-Budéjoviceu BeneSova railway corridor.

There is no evidence that Central Group’s development was confronted with similar
obstacles and constraints.

In sum: Claimants have failed to prove that the City of Prague’s decision to treat the two
investments differently, accepting the re-procurement of Central Group’s project but
denying that of Claimants’, was not based on the existence of disparities between both
developments, which justified such difference in treatment.

The Tribunal concludes that the evidence marshalled by Claimants is insufficient to prove
their case: Claimants have been unable to identify a comparator in a similar situation, which
received a more favourable treatment. And even if Central Group were to be considered an
appropriate comparator (quod non), Claimants have not shown that the disparities between
the two projects did not justify the difference in treatment in any event.

VII.1.4. FET: LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS

Claimants argue that their legitimate expectations were frustrated by the Czech Republic’s
conduct — an allegation which is rejected by Respondent.

The Tribunal will first summarise the Parties’ positions [1. and 2.], and then provide its
decision [3.].

POSITION OF CLAIMANTS

Claimants note that transparency is “closely related to protection of the investor’s legitimate
expectations” and requires that the legal framework for the investor’s operations is readily
apparent and that decisions which affect the investor can be traced back to that legal
framework.*??

According to Claimants, in this case, there was a clear legal framework for approving
changes to the Prague zoning plan, which the authorities followed during the early stages
and up to the approval of the Zoning Plan Change in 2010. Thereafter, instead of following
the standard process, officials reversed course and failed to uphold the Zoning Plan Change,
which had been implemented in order to attract the investment of a developer such as Projekt
Sever.5

Legitimate expectations

As regards the applicable standard for legitimate expectations, Claimants argue that explicit
promises (on the part of the host state) are not actually necessary in order to create legitimate
expectations. Claimants refer to case law in support of the proposition that legitimate
expectations may also arise through implicit assurances or representations upon which an
investor reasonably relies.*?4

Ultimately, according to Claimants, legitimate expectations may arise as a result of explicit
or implicit representations of the State — representations which can themselves be based on
statements or conduct. Importantly, such expectations may arise irrespective of whether the
state actually intended to create reasonable expectations. The important question, argue
Claimants, is whether, from the perspective of a reasonable investor, the conduct could be
understood as a representation, by the state, on which the investor could rely.°*°

Claimants specifically assert that at the time they invested in the land they had a legitimate
and reasonable expectation that they would be able successfully to develop the Residential
Complex Benice [1.1], and at the time they invested in the design and planning of the Project,

that the development would be successfully realised [1.2]. Finally, Claimants explain how
they say the Czech Republic’s actions violated said expectations [1.3].

1.1. CLAIMANTS LEGITIMATELY EXPECTED TO DEVELOP A RESIDENTIAL COMPLEX

558. Claimants elaborate on several facts and circumstances which, they argue, constitute implicit
assurances by Respondent that the Project would be permitted to proceed to fruition:

559. First, the timing of the Project.

560. Claimants argue that when Projekt Sever purchased the land for the Project in 2007,°”° it was
reasonable to expect that it would be able successfully to complete the development of the
Residential Complex Benice. Claimants note that the two City Districts in which the land
was located — Uhiinéves and Benice — had resolved to seek the Zoning Change in 2002 and
had then applied for the Zoning Change in 2003 and 2004, respectively.>””

561. Second, the Districts marketed the investment idea to Claimants.

562. Claimants assert that, after the districts of Benice and Uhiinéves initiated the Zoning Change,
they actively marketed the idea of developing a residential complex to potential developers.
As such, in late 2006 and early 2007, Mayor Coller and Deputy Mayor Langmajer of
Uhiinéves encouraged Mr. Pawlowski to purchase the land for the development of a
residential complex.°”8

563. Claimants maintain that the several months of time which they dedicated to due diligence
efforts was more than adequate. They note that it is typical for real estate developers to
conduct due diligence quickly. Claimants emphasise that this is especially true in light of the
fact that Mr. Pawlowski was an experienced developer, who had already successfully
realised numerous development projects in Prague.*?

564. Claimants refer to the recent decision in SolEs Badajoz v. Spain, wherein the tribunal held
that legitimate expectations are to be determined with reference to the knowledge that a
hypothetical prudent investor is deemed to have had as of the date of the investment, and
also that the extent of inquiry that it is incumbent on a prudent investor to undertake depends
on the particular circumstances of the case at hand.>*°

565. Third, the purchase price paid for the plots of land for the Project.

 

566. Claimants highlight the fact that Projekt Sever purchased land from citizens of Benice and
Uhiinéves in 2007 for the price of CZK 1250 per square meter, a price some 25 times higher

than the price of agricultural land. According to Claimants, this reflected the common
understanding and expectation that the land would be developed for residential housing.**!

Fourth, the authorities’ assistance in the execution of the purchase agreements.

 

Claimants emphasize Mayor Coller’s and Deputy Mayor Langmajer’s roles in coordinating
the private land sales, and their hosting of a signing ceremony in the municipal office of
Uhiinéves. Claimants note that the signing ceremony was also attended by representatives
of Benice, including former Mayor Miroslav Cubr, under whose leadership the rezoning and
development project had been launched.**”

Fifth, the authorities’ continued support from 2007 to 2012.

Claimants explain that their expectations were not based on a single representation or a few
individual representations, but on the fact that representatives of both Uhiinéves and Benice
continued to act in accordance with the perceived assurances throughout the period from
2007 to 2012.53

For these reasons, while Claimants acknowledge that the Project Area had not yet been zoned
for residential development when Projekt Sever purchased the land, they assert that they
legitimately and reasonably expected that the Zoning Plan Change would be approved, and
that Claimants would be able to carry out the development of a housing project of the scale
of Residential Complex Benice.***

Claimants point to the fact that the Prague City Assembly voted in March 2010 to approve
the zoning plan change as further evidence confirming the reasonableness of their
expectations in 2007 and 2008 that such approval would be granted.**>

CLAIMANTS LEGITIMATELY EXPECTED THE PROJECT WOULD BE SUCCESSFULLY
REALISED

Claimants assert that their legitimate expectations were maintained and even bolstered in the
years following the land purchases, which led them to continue investing in the realisation
of the Residential Complex Benice for five years, until Benice filed its annulment lawsuit in
2012. Thus, Claimants argue that the Tribunal must also assess Claimants’ legitimate

expectations throughout this period.**°

Claimants maintain that their expectations were legitimate, because:
First, following the land purchases, Claimants hired the Prague architect Marek Tichy (and

his firm TaK) and paid for the design and planning of Residential Complex Benice.
Claimants explain that TaK’s work included designing the Project, drafting the Project

documentation, preparing the numerous studies required to assess infrastructure
requirements and environmental impacts and meeting with City and District officials
regarding these issues.**” Claimants explain that they were presented with no obstacles
during this period, and they note that, following its approval in March 2010, the Zoning Plan
Change was not challenged until June 2012, when Benice filed its annulment lawsuit.>**
Second, although Benice filed a lawsuit in 2009 challenging Projekt Sever’s title to the land
it had purchased from the City, Claimants considered that the lawsuit had no chance of
success. Claimants note that the only communication received from Benice at the time was
a proposal that Projekt Sever pay to settle the lawsuit, not an objection to construction of a
large residential complex on the land.**?

Third, Benice’s May 2011 approval of the increase in density from level “B” to level “C”
confirmed that it supported the development of a large residential complex and, along with
prior approvals by various authorities, further confirmed that there were no substantive
reasons why a residential complex of that density could not be realised in the Project Area.**°

 

Claimants explain that the OB-C zoning designation allowed for construction on the scale
of 823 housing units in buildings as high as four floors. According to Claimants, TaK worked
to refine the design of the project well within the limits of density coefficient OB-C,
underscoring the fact that, at the time that work was stopped due to Benice’s annulment
lawsuit, the plans called for only 796 units.*4!

Claimants additionally argue that during this period in which they continued to invest in the
project, they had no reason to anticipate”:

that Benice would file a lawsuit in June 2012, seeking annulment of the Zoning Plan
Change;

much less, that such a lawsuit would be successful; or

that the City of Prague would fail to remedy any defects found by the Court in the City’s
procurement process.

Claimants’ due diligence efforts

Claimants reject Respondent’s argument** that their alleged expectations were objectively

unreasonable, given the insufficiency of their due diligence efforts prior to investing.

According to Claimants, who rely on SolEs Badajoz, legitimate expectations are determined
with reference to the knowledge that a hypothetical prudent investor is deemed to have had
as of the date of the investment, and that the extent of inquiry that is incumbent on a prudent
investor depends on the particular circumstances of the case.*##

Claimants assert that it is typical for real estate developers, especially those working in
booming markets, to conduct due diligence quickly. Claimants note that Mr. Pawlowski was
an experienced developer who had already successfully realized numerous development
projects in Prague, and they argue that the several months of time taken by Claimants was
more than adequate to conduct thorough due diligence.**°

RESPONDENT’S ACTIONS VIOLATED CLAIMANTS’ LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS

Claimants consider that their legitimate expectations were violated by Benice, when it filed
a lawsuit in 2012, seeking to annul the Zoning Plan Change [A.] and by the City of Prague’s
termination of the procurement of the Zoning Plan Change following its annulment [B.].

Benice’s 2012 Annulment Request

According to Claimants, Benice’s officials actively supported the development of a large
residential complex in the Project Area for a decade, through the sale of the land at residential
prices, which included “an element of inducement”, thus requiring the state to stand by its
statements and its conduct.™° By filing the Annulment Request, Benice failed to stand by its
statements and conduct, reversed course and actively set out to destroy the Zoning Plan
Change and prevent the realisation of the Project. Claimants thus argue that Benice’s filing
of the Annulment Request was a violation of the FET standard in Article 4 of the BIT.**”

The City of Prague’s new administration remained obligated by the previous
administration’s assurances

In response to the Respondent’s contention that, in 2014, the new Government had complete
discretion to reverse the City’s 2010 position that the Zoning Plan Change should be
approved,*#* Claimants argue that the principle of estoppel applies in international law, and
that the new administration of the City of Prague was thus bound by the assurances made to
Claimants by the previous administration.>””

Claimants explain that in this case, they were encouraged to purchase plots of land for the
Project — and to pay a price for the land that far exceeded the market prices for agricultural

land — because City of Prague officials had provided assurances that the zoning plan change
was expected to be approved and that they would assist Claimants in realising the Project.>°

587. Claimants allege that both Mayor Hudeéek and Deputy Mayor Stropnicky seized on the
opportunity provided by the Annulment of the Zoning Plan Change to reverse the prior
approval by a previous municipal administration. According to Claimants, this reversal of
position violated Article 4 of the BIT™!.

2. POSITION OF RESPONDENT.

588. Respondent asserts that the Republic’s conduct did not frustrate Claimants’ legitimate
expectations, because under international law an investor’s expectations are protected only
when they satisfy very specific requirements, which Claimants do not satisfy.*°? In
particular, Claimants could not have held any legitimate expectations of developing a huge
residential complex, since their land purchases for the Project involved non-residential lands
[2.1]. Thus, Respondent argues that the actions of the Czech Republic did not, and could not,
frustrate Claimants’ alleged expectations [2.2].

2.1. CLAIMANTS COULD NOT HAVE HELD ANY LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS OF DEVELOPING
THE BENICE RESIDENTIAL COMPLEX

589. Respondent rejects Claimants’ position and argues that Claimants could not have held any
legitimate expectations, because:

- Respondent did not make any specific and unambiguous representations [A.];

- Claimants base their alleged expectations on promises that were not made by a competent
person [B.]; and

- Claimants’ alleged expectations were unreasonable in light of the Czech legal framework
[C.] and the insufficiency of Claimants’ due diligence efforts [D.].

A. No specific and unambiguous representatioi

590. According to Respondent, an investor cannot legitimately expect that a State’s regulatory
framework will not change, unless there has been a specific and unambiguous commitment
by the State on which the investor reasonably relied at the time of investing.**

591. Respondent argues that legitimate expectations can only exist within limited circumstances,
which it explains as follows:

550 C_PHB, para. 156-157.

 

131

- First, legitimate expectations can only arise from specific promises or representations from
the State to an individual investor, on which the investor has relied in making its
investment>**;

- Second, the existence of legitimate expectations must be assessed at the time of the
555.

investment — and cannot be founded on subsequent actions”;

- Third, an investor’s expectations must have been legitimate and reasonable in light of the
circumstances, and not based on the investor’s subjective motivations and
considerations.**°

592. Respondent argues that there is no evidence in this case of any sufficiently specific and
unambiguous representation made by the Czech Republic. According to Respondent, any
representations invoked by Claimants, whether explicit or implicit, must be “precise as to
[their] content and clear as to [their] form”, in order to amount to the type of identifiable
quasi-contractual commitment capable of giving rise to legitimate expectations.**”

593. Respondent asserts that the alleged representations on its part and upon which Claimants
purport to rely were all vague, ambiguous, or not even specifically addressed to them.
Additionally, Respondent argues that Claimants have failed to provide evidence which
supports their claim that they were encouraged to invest.>°*

B. The alleged promises were not made by competent persons

594. According to Respondent, for an investor’s expectations to be objectively reasonable — and
thus legitimate — they must arise out of representations made by a competent organ of the
State.°°?

595. The final decision regarding the Zoning Plan Change came from the Prague City Assembly,
and Claimants have neither claimed, nor demonstrated that the Assembly ever made any
promise or representation to them that their lands would be rezoned.>

C. Claimants’ alleged expectations were unreasonable in light of the Czech legal
framework pertaining to zoning changes

596. Respondent asserts that for an investor’s expectations to be “legitimate”, they must also be
objectively reasonable in light of the surrounding legal and factual circumstances.*°!

597. According to Respondent, when Mr. Pawlowski purchased the land before it was zoned as
residential, he chose to speculate on the outcome of the zoning process. Respondent argues
that Mr. Pawlowski may have hoped, but could not have reasonably expected, to develop his
residential complex there.°

598. Respondent explains that when Claimants purchased the land for the Project, they acquired
the rights to agricultural land — the fact that the Zoning Change was initially approved by the
Prague City Assembly before being annulled did not create an acquired right or a legitimate
expectation.°®

599. Furthermore, Respondent avers that at all stages, the actions taken by Benice and the City of
Prague were within the legal framework pertaining to zoning changes. Respondent notes that
Czech law provides for a two-year period during which any change to the zoning plan can
be challenged before the Czech courts.**

D. Claimants’ alleged expectations were unreasonable given the insufficiency of their
prior due diligence

600. Respondent argues that Claimants’ due diligence was inadequate and contends that, in
general, investors’ prior due diligence plays a central role in evaluating the reasonableness
of their expectations.*>

601.

Respondent argues that had Claimants conducted proper due diligence, they would have
easily uncovered multiple important facts including:

- that a zoning change (Zoning Change Z-592/04) covering Mr. Pawlowski’s land plots had
already been rejected by the Prague City Assembly, despite having the support of Benice
and Uhiinéves™™; and

- that some authorities had already voiced concern as to the environmental impact of a
residential development in the area.*”

602. Additionally, Respondent argues that Mr. Pawlowski never seriously investigated the
expectations of the Benice Assembly for the development of the land. Respondent notes that
Benice originally conceived of residential expansion in the area which would raise the
population by approximately 600 people from among citizens living in the area.*°* Thus, Mr.
Pawlowski should have expected that developing a residential complex which would bring
4,000 new people into a borough with a population of 465 inhabitants, would likely lead the
local population to oppose the project.°”

603. It is Respondent’s view that, for the reasons stated above, Claimants’ expectations that they
would be able to develop a large residential complex were not objectively reasonable or
legitimate. Respondent adds that the Claimants cannot use the BIT’s FET clause as an
insurance policy for risky business decisions.*”°

2.2 THE CZECH REPUBLIC DID NOT FRUSTRATE CLAIMANTS’ ALLEGED EXPECTATIONS

604. Respondent maintains that the Czech Republic did not frustrate Claimants’ alleged
expectations because: Benice was entitled to pursue the Annulment Decision [A.], and the
City of Prague’s actions were not outside of the norm [B.].

A. Benice was entitled to seek the Annulment Decision

605. Respondent asserts that no treaty protection could prevent Benice from exercising its right
to request the annulment of a zoning plan change that might affect it. According to
Respondent, the exercise of that right was appropriately enforced under Czech law by the
Czech Courts and it did not violate Claimants’ legitimate expectations.*”!

606. Respondent acknowledges Claimants’ explanation that FET requires a balancing between
the investors’ legitimate expectations on one hand and the host State’s legitimate regulatory
interests on the other.>’? According to Respondent, however, Benice had legitimate concerns
after becoming aware of the scale of the Project. Additionally, Respondent argues that
Benice’s challenge to the Zoning Plan Change was within its legal rights and was exercised
as part of its prerogatives.°”*

B. The City of Prague did not behave unexpectedly

607. Respondent argues that, even if Claimants’ expectations were somehow considered
legitimate (quod non), the facts demonstrate that the City of Prague did nothing to frustrate
them.°”4

608. Respondent notes that Claimants’ case relies on the standard set by the Foresight tribunal,
which found that the frustration of legitimate expectations requires “‘an unprecedented and

wholly different regulatory approach, based on wholly different premises that amounted to
a total and unreasonable change” of the regulatory regime surrounding an investment.*”>

According to Respondent, however, this case is not Foresight. There is nothing
unprecedented about the Prague City Assembly’s decision not to re-procure an annulled
zoning plan change. Respondent points out that there are still at least twice as many annulled
zoning changes that the Assembly did not re-procure (at least six) than changes that it has
re-procured (three).°7°

Ultimately, according to Respondent, the Prague City Assembly’s regulatory approach in
deciding not to re-procure the Zoning Change was neither unprecedented, nor out of the
norm. Rather, it was made in accordance with Czech law and in line with its standard
procedures.°””

DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

Claimants allege that the Czech Republic breached its duty to guarantee FET as required by
Article 4(2) of the BIT by violating Claimants’ legitimate expectations. Article 4(2) reads as
follows:

“Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment within its territory of
the investments of the investors of the other Contracting Party.”°”*

It is uncontentious that the obligation to accord FET to investments encompasses the
protection of an investor’s legitimate expectations. Such expectations arise when a State (or
its agencies) makes representations or commitments or gives assurances, upon which the
foreign investor (in the exercise of an objectively reasonable business judgment) relies, and
the frustration occurs when the State thereafter changes its position as against those
expectations in a way that causes injury to the investor.°”? The protection of legitimate
expectations is closely connected with the principles of good faith,**° estoppel and the
prohibition encapsulated in the maxim venire contra factum proprium.

 

A State can create legitimate expectations vis:
contexts:

vis a foreign investor in two different

In the first context, the State makes specific representations, assurances, or commitments
directly to the investor (or to a narrow class of investors or potential investors) (“direct
legitimate expectations”);

but legal expectations can also be created in some cases by the State’s general legislative
and regulatory framework: an investor may make an investment in reasonable reliance

upon the stability of that framework, so that in certain circumstances a reform of the
framework may breach the investor’s regulatory legitimate expectations.

In this case, Claimants submit that the Czech Republic gave implicit assurances and thus
created a direct legitimate expectation that the Zoning Plan Change would be approved, and
that the investor would be able successfully to develop the Residential Complex; after having
created this legitimate expectation, and induced Claimants to purchase land and to continue
investing in the Project, the Czech Republic, without justification, changed its position and
withdrew the Zoning Plan Change, causing injury to the investor and breaching the FET
standard.

The Arbitral Tribunal must determine whether Claimants indeed had a direct legitimate
expectation that the Project would materialise and whether this expectation was unlawfully
breached by the Czech Republic. The Arbitral Tribunal will briefly recall the relevant facts
concerning this issue [A.] and will then issue its decision [B.].

Proven facts

In 2007 (i.e., three years before the City Assembly’s approval of the zoning change) Mr.
Pawlowski was introduced to the Mayor of Uhiinéves, Mr. Coller and to the Deputy Mayor,
Mr. Langmajer. Mr. Pawlowski was actively looking for investment opportunities. In the
course of their discussion Mr. Coller and Mr. Langmajer informed him of the ongoing efforts
by the district of Uhiinéves to find a developer to construct a residential complex in Benice.

The Mayor and Deputy Mayor informed Mr. Pawlowski that the Project Area was in the
process of being re-zoned to allow residential construction. Mr. Pawlowski was also
informed that the Concept for the re-zoning had already been approved and that private
citizens as well as the City of Prague wanted to sell their plots of land to a developer who
would pursue the development of the Project.**! Mr. Pawlowski met with the leadership of
the local governments of Benice and Uhiinéves, including the head of the construction
division of the Prague 22 Administrative District (which covered both Uhiinéves and
Benice).

Claimants’ purchase of land

Projekt Sever eventually concluded all of the relevant land purchases between June 2007
and December 2008 at a time when the re-zoning was still underway (a Concept had been
approved by the City Assembly, but the Assembly’s final approval would only come two
years later in 2010).

Projekt Sever acquired the Project Area from different owners: private citizens, the City of
Prague, and the Ministry of Defense of the Czech Republic.

The majority of the Project Area involved land previously owned by private landowners.
The purchase process went smoothly, because from the outset, Uhiinéves’ Mayor Coller and

Deputy Mayor Langmajer offered the District’s assistance in coordinating the
transactions,°*

On 28 June 2007, the district of Uhiinéves organised and hosted a signing ceremony in the
Uhiinéves town hall for the private property owners, with a scheduled time slot for each
family. Among the officials present were Uhiinéves’ Mayor Coller, Deputy Mayor
Langmajer and the former mayor of the district of Benice, Mr. Cubr, under whose leadership
the re-zoning and development project had been launched.***

Projekt Sever’s purchase of land from the City of Prague

 

Claimants also pursued the purchase of certain plots of land owned by the City of Prague
and located within the District of Benice.*** The Benice District Assembly had since June
2000 delegated the administration of these plots to the neighboring District of Uhifnéves,**
and Claimants therefore negotiated directly with officials from Uhiinéves.

A tender was launched, and the only bidder was Projekt Sever. Its “envelope” was opened
on 23 May 2007 before the Council of Uhiinéves, and Mr. Langmajer, the Deputy Mayor,
explained to the Council the buyer’s intention, which was “to build a residential complex on
an extensive area.”°*° The Council agreed to the sale, and three weeks thereafter, on 16 June
2007, the Assembly of Uhiinéves formally approved the sale of the land, which was
described as “arable land” and “forest land.” The Assembly’s Resolution made no reference
to the zoning situation of the land plots, nor to the investor’s intention.**”

On 20 June 2007, Projekt Sever and Prague 22 District signed the Prague Purchase Contract,
which simply described the asset as “arable land”; the buyer paid CZK 43,820,000 for the
43,784 m? of land owned by the City of Prague. There is no reference to the pending Zoning
Plan Change, nor any representation or warranty regarding the possibility to develop a
housing complex on the land. ***

Purchase of military owned land

In addition, Projekt Sever also purchased a small portion of land (about 8% of the total) from
the Czech Ministry of Defense, which owned several small plots of land in the Project Area
as well as old buildings that had once served as housing for military personnel, and included
structures such as workshops, fencing, and outdoor lighting.**? By 1992 the military had

mostly abandoned the complex, but the buildings and related structures remained. As of 2007
the majority of the military owned buildings and fixtures were in a state of disrepair.°°”

626. On 8 December 2008 Projekt Sever signed the Defense Purchase Contract with the Ministry
of Defense. The buyer paid CZK 10,854,281 to the Ministry for 1,135 m of land, and for
the right to tear down the structures and dispose of the spoil.*?! The Defense Purchase
Contract describes the object of the sale as “structures” and “miscellaneous” and “unfertile”
land. Again, there is no reference to the pending Zoning Plan Change, nor any representation
or warranty regarding the possibility to develop a housing complex on the land.*”

B. Decision

627. The Tribunal has already determined®” that direct legitimate expectations — the type of
expectations allegedly violated by Respondent in this case*”* — can only result in the breach
of the FET standard if the following criteria are met:

- The host State must have made specific and unambiguous representations, assurances or
promises,

- These declarations must have been made to an investor prior to, or at the time of, the
investment; and

- the expectations must be reasonable and legitimate in light of the circumstances.

628. A careful review of the facts shows that neither the Czech Republic, nor any of its territorial
divisions (including the Districts of Uhiinéves and Benice and the City of Prague) made any
specific and unambiguous representations, assurances, or promises to Claimants that the
procurement of the Zoning Plan Change would be authorised or that the development of the
Project would be successful:

629. First, Projekt Sever signed two contracts with the Czech Republic for the purchase of land
for the development of the Project:

= the Prague Purchase Contract with the City of Prague and
- the Defense Purchase Contract with the Ministry of Defense.
630. The object of both Contracts was “agricultural land”, “forest land”, “miscellaneous land”,

“unfertile land” and “structures.” There is no reference to the pending Zoning Plan Change
— let alone a specific and unambiguous representation or assurance that the Zoning Plan

Change would be successfully procured and that the terrain would become suitable for the
development of a housing complex.

The absence of a specific representation in both Contracts is specially telling, because in the
meeting of the Council of Uhiinéves, which declared that Projekt Sever had won the tender
to purchase the land, Mr. Langmajer, the Deputy Mayor, explained to the Council that the
buyer had the intention to build a residential complex.*”* The subsequent resolution of the
Assembly of Uhiinéves, however, lacks any reference to the residential complex and simply
authorises the sale of parcels of “arable land.” And the same language is then used in the
Prague Purchase Contract.

Claimants were perfectly aware that they were buying land zoned as “arable” and “forest”,
and that while the Zoning Plan Change was being procured, it had not yet been authorised.
It would be remarkable if Mr. Pawlowski, a seasoned real estate developer, had not sought
contractual assurances from the City of Prague and from the Ministry of Defense,
guaranteeing that the Zoning Plan Change would be procured; the absence of any such
assurance in either the Prague and the Defense Purchase Contracts would suggest that if any
such request was made, it had been turned down. Yet, notwithstanding the absence of any
express commitment, Claimants were prepared to proceed with the purchase and to assume
the contractual risk that, if the Zoning Plan Change was dismissed, Project Sever would
remain the owner of agricultural and forest land, without any recourse against the public
sector sellers.

It lies ill in Claimants’ mouths now to protest the explicit distribution of risks agreed in the
Contracts, and to claim that the Czech Republic, through an alleged breach of the FET
standard, should assume a risk which, by agreement, fell to be borne by Claimants
themselves.

Second, the facts show that, although the municipal authorities of both Benice and Uhiinéves
supported the investment, they were careful never to make a specific and unambiguous
declaration binding either of the Municipalities.

Mr. Coller — Mayor of Uhiinéves — had the following recollection:

“The investor asked for assurance that the boroughs’ support would not cease if he
became involved in the project. The two boroughs constantly expressed support for the
project they themselves had initiated.” °°° [Emphasis added]

At the Hearing, the Tribunal asked Mr. Coller, who was called as a witness by the Claimants,
what he had promised Mr. Pawlowski in exchange for payment of a higher price for the land.
Mr. Coller replied:

“[...] Lcannot say that I promised anything because I was in an office; I wasn't running
a company. This wasn't my promise. These were negotiations and discussions with the
heads of departments and construction departments, et cetera. There were some

materials about our agreement with starting the process of the required change. It was

more or less an assurance that both boroughs desired the change, and, as I said, it had
never happened that a change approved by both boroughs would not get through the
Prague City Assembly, so we could as it were promise that the path we started on would
be successful and it was inconceivable that this wouldn't be so.” °°” [Emphasis added]

The words of the Mayor show that the District “supported” the Zoning Plan Change and the
development, that the two boroughs “desired” the Zoning Plan Change to be successful and
that previous experience showed that procurement in general was successful. General
assurances of this type, made orally by politicians at the municipal level, and not reflected
in the contractual documents signed with the very Municipality, are incapable of creating
legitimate expectations on which an investor is entitled to rely, and even less of engaging
the international responsibility of the Czech Republic.

Third, even if it is assumed arguendo that the Mayor of Uhiinéves made specific promises
to the protected investor that the Zoning Plan Change would be procured (quod non), such
conduct would still not give rise to a legitimate expectation, because it would have been
rendered by an authority incompetent to make such a commitment.

Under Czech Law, zoning changes entail a long and democratic administrative process,
which at its conclusion requires the approval by a body politic, the Prague City Assembly.
Although the Benice and Uhiinéves Districts initiated and supported the Zoning Plan
Change, the Mayor of Uhiinéves had no competence over the approval. As for the City of
Prague Assembly, Claimants are not claiming that the Assembly ever made any promise or
representation that the Zoning Plan Change would be procured or re-procured.°**

Fourth, for an investor’s expectations to be “legitimate”, they must also be reasonable in
light of the surrounding legal and factual circumstances.

When Mr. Pawlowski purchased the Project Area, he made a business decision to invest in
agricultural land, without requesting the City of Prague and the Ministry of Defense to
provide contractual commitments or representations and warranties to the effect that the use
of the land would be amended to his benefit. At that time there already existed reasonable
doubts regarding the success of the Zoning Plan Change: a previous zoning change (Zoning
Change Z-592/04) affecting the same area had already been rejected by the Prague City
Assembly, despite having the support of Benice and Uhiinéves*”” and some authorities had
already voiced concern as to the environmental impact of a residential development in the

area,

Mr. Pawlowski was perfectly aware, when he bought the real estate, that the Zoning Plan
Change had not been authorised, and that there was a chance — even if then thought remote
— that successful procurement would be thwarted by unforeseeable future developments.

This uncertainty was reflected in the purchase price which Claimants paid. Claimants bought
the land for an average price of CZK 1,253 per sqm, which, while higher than that of
agricultural land, was well below the maximum prices paid for developed land, which could
reach CZK 2,900 per m’, as confirmed by Claimants’ valuation expert, Mr. Karl Schumacher
of AlixPartners.°"!

Fifth, the fact that the Zoning Plan Change was initially approved by the Prague City
Assembly did not create an acquired right. Czech law provides for a two-year period during
which any change to the zoning plan can be challenged before the Courts.” Claimants could
have had no legitimate expectation that those with legal standing (the Districts or
associations, or particular interested parties affected by the measure, efc.) would not exercise
their legal right to challenge the procurement.

In summary, the conduct of the Districts of Uhiinéves and Benice, and of the Municipal
authorities of Prague, did not generate a legitimate expectation, to the benefit of Claimants,
that the Zoning Plan Change would be authorised by the Prague Assembly and that the
Residential Complex could be successfully promoted.

VII.2. BREACH OF ARTICLE 3(2) OF THE BIT

646. Claimants allege that the City of Prague violated the obligation to “grant the necessary
permits” under Article 3(2) of the BIT, by failing to cure the defects in the substantiation for
the Zoning Plan Change.*?

647. The Tribunal will summarize the Parties’ positions [1. and 2.] and then render its
decision [3.].

1. POSITION OF CLAIMANTS

648. Claimants assert that Article 3 of the BIT must be interpreted in accordance with the BIT’s
object and purpose of promoting investments. According to Claimants, the City’s failure
to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change blocked them from making the additional investments
they would have made in order to complete the construction and sale of the Project. Thus,
Claimants argue that this constituted a failure by the City to “promote investments by
investors of the other Contracting Party and admit such investments.”°°>

649. Additionally, according to Claimants, the reference in Article 4 of the BIT to the Article 3
obligation “to issue the necessary authorizations” confirms that the Contracting Parties did
not intend to limit the scope of Article 3 to the issuance of “permits” as defined at the local
level. Instead, Claimants argue that the approval of the Zoning Plan Change through the re-
procurement process was itself a “necessary authorization” that was required to be granted
in order for Claimants to proceed with the realisation of their Project.°°

650. Claimants aver that because there were no legal obstacles standing in the way of the re-
procurement of the Zoning Plan Change, Respondent was required by Article 3 of the BIT
to pursue said re-procurement. Claimants emphasize that re-procuring and approving the
Zoning Plan Change in this case required no changes to the current laws and regulations and
was therefore an obligation under Article 3 of the BIT.%”

2. POSITION OF RESPONDENT
651. Respondent rejects Claimants’ allegations.°*

652. First, Respondent argues that the allegations made by Claimants do not relate to “permits”,
but to a zoning plan change, and that the claim is therefore outside the scope of Article 3(2)

the obligation to grant “the necessary permits and authorizations concerning the activities to be carried out by
investors”).

of the BIT.© Respondent emphasises that Article 3(2) applies to “permits”, and in this case
the Claimants did not reach the permitting stage, such that this provision of the BIT became
relevant.°!?

653. Second, Respondent argues that even if permits and zoning changes could be equated (quod
non), Claimants’ claim would nevertheless fail, because there has been no violation of
Article 3(2).°!!

654. According to Respondent, Article 3(2) requires that permits be granted “in accordance with
the host state’s laws and regulations”, which places an obligation of conduct on the
Contracting Parties — and not an obligation of result.°!? Respondent explains that, in the
present case, such obligations as it might have pursuant to Article 3(2) were honoured: the
issuance, challenge and annulment of the Zoning Plan Change and the termination of its
procurement all occurred in full conformity with Czech law.°!?

3. DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

655. Claimants allege that the City of Prague violated the obligations under Article 3 of the BIT
by failing to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change, which would have permitted the land
purchased by Claimants to be used for residential purposes.

656. Respondent rejects Claimants’ arguments. According to Respondent, Article 3 refers
specifically to the issuance of permits, not the approval of zoning plan changes, and even if
Article 3 were applicable to zoning changes, there still would be no violation, since at all
times, Respondent acted in conformity with Czech law.

657. Article 3(1) of the BIT addresses the promotion and admission of investments:

“(1) Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote investments by investors of
the other Contracting Party and admit such investments in accordance with its laws and
regulations.”

658. Article 3(2) of the BIT specifies one of the ways in which the host State can guarantee the
promotion and admission of investments. In particular, the host State shall grant the
necessary “permits” and “authorizations” in connection with investments, in accordance
with its laws and regulations:

“(2) When a Contracting Party shall have admitted an investment on its territory, it shall,
in accordance with its laws and regulations, grant the necessary permits in connection
with such an investment and with the carrying out of licensing agreements and contracts
for technical, commercial or administrative assistance. Each Contracting Party shall,

to grant the permits in accordance with its own laws.”).

whenever needed, endeavour to issue the necessary authorizations concerning the
activities of consultants and other qualified persons of foreign nationality.” [Emphasis
added]

Article 4(1) of the BIT (already referred to in previous sections) prohibits the impairment of
investments through unreasonable or discriminatory measures. In particular, Article 4(1)
requires that the host State issue the necessary “authorizations” mentioned in Article 3(2):

“Each Contracting Party shall protect within its territory investments made in
accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party and
shall not impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and liquidation of such investments. In
particular, each Contracting Party shall issue the necessary authorizations mentioned in
Article 3, paragraph (2) of this Agreement.” [Emphasis added]

 

 

Thus, the BIT contains a double mandate regarding the issuance of the necessary permits
and authorisations:

A positive obligation under Article 3(2): the host State shall grant “permits” in connection
with the investment, subject to its laws and regulations; additionally, the host State shall
“endeavour” to issue the “authorizations” required by consultants and other qualified
persons; and

A negative obligation under Article 4(1) in relation to Article 3(2): the host State shall not
impair investments by refusing to issue the necessary “authorizations” — an obligation
which (at least in a literal interpretation) seems to refer to those authorizations required by
consultants and other qualified persons to carry out their profession.

According to Claimants, Respondent should have applied its existing procedures to re-
procure and approve the Zoning Plan Change.°'* Claimants emphasise that re-procuring and
approving the Zoning Plan Change in this case required no changes to the current laws and
regulations and was therefore an obligation under Article 3 of the BIT.°!°

Respondent, on the other hand, argues that Article 3(2) of the BIT applies only to “permits”,
but not to “zoning changes”, which are rules of general application.

Discussion
The Tribunal agrees with Respondent.

First, the approval by the Prague Assembly of a Zoning Plan Change does not fit within the
ordinary definition of “permit” or “authorization.”

A “permit” or “authorization” is an administrative act, issued by an administrative authority,
granting the beneficiary the right to perform a certain regulated activity.

°!4 C-PHB, para. 185.
©'5 © II, paras. 555-557; C-PHB, para. 192.

144

666. A zoning plan is a rule of general application approved by the Municipal Assembly (a
democratically elected political body), establishing the rules (binding on all citizens) for the
proper use of land. Zoning plan changes are, from a legal point of view, amendments to rules
of general application, which also require approval by the Municipal Assembly.

667. The Tribunal notes that the distinction between rules pertaining to land use planning and the
issuance of permits has been discussed by prior ICSID tribunals. In UAB E Energija, for
example, the tribunal explained:

“it is doubtful that the concept of a ‘necessary permit’ or ‘necessary authorisation’ ‘in
connection with the investment’ is to be interpreted and construed so as to include the
heat supply development plan for the City of Rézekne, which is part of the management
and planning duties of the Municipality; this document was not, in any event, issued by
the Municipality as a permit and does not represent an authorisation allowing any
particular action on the part of the Operator.”*!°

668. Second, even if it is accepted arguendo that the re-procurement of a zoning plan change can
be equated with the issuance of a permit (quod non), the only obligation which Article 3(2)
puts on the shoulders of the host State is to grant such permits “in accordance with its laws
and regulations.” If, in accordance with municipal law, the investor is not entitled to the
permit, no breach of the BIT obligation is committed. Article 3(2) thus creates a simple
obligation of conduct on the Contracting Parties — and is not a guarantee of any particular
outcome. °!”

669. In the present case, the Czech Republic did adhere to the obligations imposed by Article
3(2): the issuance, challenge and annulment of the Zoning Plan Change, and the termination
of its procurement, all occurred in full conformity with Czech law.°!®

HK

670. In view of the above, the Tribunal dismisses Claimants’ claim that the Respondent violated
the obligation to “grant the necessary permits” under Article 3(2) of the BIT.

VII.3. BREACH OF

 

TICLE 6 OF THE BIT

671. Claimants argue that the City of Prague’s termination of the re-procurement of the Zoning
Plan Change amounted to an indirect expropriation in violation of Article 6(1) of the BIT.°!

672. The Tribunal will summarise the Parties’ positions [1. and 2.] and then set out its decision
[3.].

1. POSITION OF CLAIMANTS

673. According to Claimants, it is common ground that the BIT’s protections extend to indirect
expropriation — which includes the taking of the commercial value of an investment by
measures that “neutralize the benefit of the property of the foreign owner.”©”? Claimants
refer to case law in support of the view that a deprivation or taking of property may occur
through interference by a State with the use of the property or with the enjoyment of the
benefits of the property.°!

674. Claimants argue that if Benice had not filed the Annulment Request, and if the City of Prague
had not terminated the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change, then the Project Area
would have remained zoned for residential development and Claimants would have realized
their investments.°”

675. Claimants argue that this is enough to establish expropriation, which only requires that an
investor show “that the rights that it would otherwise enjoy have been substantially impacted
or that it has been deprived of control over or access to the economic use of its
investment.”°

676. Claimants allege that the Annulment Decision resulted in the loss of almost all of the value
of Projekt Sever’s and Pawlowski AG’s investment.°**

677. Claimants argue that by actively seeking the annulment of the residential zoning designation
for the Project Area and failing to re-procure it, Respondent fatally interfered with
Claimants’ investment and destroyed nearly all of the value of Claimants’ property.

Claimants also note that a hypothetical future scenario in which both the District of Benice
and the City of Prague might someday change their positions and support the development
of the Project, is not enough to cure the impact of the City of Prague’s and Benice’s actions
on Claimants and their investments.°?°

POSITION OF RESPONDENT.

Respondent rejects Claimants’ allegations and argues that the Czech Republic did not
expropriate Claimants’ alleged investments in violation of Article 6 of the BIT.

Respondent emphasises the fact that Claimants’ purchase of land took place before the land
was zoned for residential development. This is critical, argues Respondent, because it means
that Claimants allege the expropriation of rights that they had never actually acquired.’

According to Respondent, the creation and acquisition of rights (which are later protected
by the BIT) is a matter of Czech law. Respondent notes that Czech Courts have consistently
confirmed that there is no subjective right of an owner to have its property included within
a certain zoning category.°** Claimants’ expropriation claims must be dismissed, since the
only rights acquired by Claimants were property rights over agricultural lands and
brownfield sites.

Respondent adds that, even assuming Claimants held vested rights capable of being
expropriated (quod non), Claimants have still failed to prove any interference with their
property rights of a sufficiently restrictive, permanent, and irreversible nature to justify a
finding of indirect expropriation.**°

 

  

Furthermore, even if there had been a restrictive interference with Claimants’ alleged
property rights, this was neither permanent nor irreversible, as would be required to establish
expropriation.©! Moreover, Respondent notes that Claimants have acknowledged that they
consider that the development of the Project is still possible.

Finally, Respondent notes that Claimants remain the owners of the exact same agricultural
land and brownfield sites that they purchased in 2007, and that they remain entitled to initiate
a procedure that could lead to a future zoning change.°**

Respondent argues that, in any event, the police powers doctrine — which stipulates that
regulatory activity of a State is not compensable — would further prevent any finding of a
compensable expropriation.°*

According to Respondent, the Prague City Assembly’s decision to terminate the procurement
was a legitimate exercise of its democratic mandate and was taken as part of the State’s
regulatory powers over land use and development. Thus, according to Respondent, the police
powers doctrine prevents any finding of a compensable expropriation in this case.*>

DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

Claimants submit that if Benice had not filed the Annulment Request, and if the City of
Prague had not terminated the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change, then, first, the
Project Area would have remained zoned for residential development and Claimants’
property would not have lost almost all of its value, and, second, that these developments
constitute an indirect expropriation of Claimants’ investment in violation of Article 6 of the
BIT.

Respondent disagrees. It alleges that Claimants never acquired rights capable of being
expropriated, and even if they had, they never suffered a substantial or permanent or
irreversible deprivation of their assets sufficiently serious to constitute an indirect
expropriation.

The Tribunal will begin by establishing the proper interpretation of Article 6(1) [A.] and will
thereafter provide its reasoning for dismissing Claimants’ claims of expropriation [B.].

A. Interpretation of Article 6(1

Article 6(1) of the BIT records the guarantee provided to investors against unlawful
expropriation in the following terms:

“Neither Contracting Party shall take, either directly or indirectly, measures of
expropriation, nationalization or any other measure having the same nature or the same
effect against investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, unless the
measures are taken in the public interest, on a non-discriminatory basis, and under due
process of law, and provided that provisions be made for effective and adequate
compensation. The amount of compensation, interest included, shall be settled in the
currency of the country of origin of the investment and paid without delay to the person
entitled thereto without regard to its residence or domicile.” [Emphasis added]

 

691. Article 6(1) of the BIT contains a general prohibition against three types of taking by the

host State:
expropriation,
nationalisation, and

other measures having the same nature or the same effect.

635 R-PHB, para. 237.

148

692. The term “measures” is not defined in the BIT, but it is generally accepted that it
encompasses all

- administrative acts taken by the Czech State, including its agencies and territorial bodies;
and

- legislative acts of general application formalised as laws approved by Parliament or as
decrees or other regulations authorised by the Government, and

= judicial decisions.

Expropriation and nationalisation

693. The BIT does not provide a definition of “expropriation” or “nationalisation”, but the terms
are well established international law concepts.

694. In an “expropriation” a State, exercising its sovereign powers, dispossesses an investor of a
protected investment, depriving the investor of the use and benefit (but not necessarily of the
ownership or title) of the investment. The definition of expropriation is centered on the
taking suffered by the investor: there is no requirement that the investor’s loss should
translate into enrichment of the State (or of the State’s designee) — although typically
expropriations will result in wealth passing from the investor to the State, to a public entity,
or to a private beneficiary favored by the State.

695. “Nationalisation” is a concept analogous to expropriation, whereby control of the
expropriated assets, usually entire industrial sectors of the economy, or covering certain
types of natural resources, is taken over by the State or by a State-controlled entity.°*°

Indirect expropriation or equivalent measures

696. In the past, takings of alien property usually took the form of direct expropriations, i.e., by
overt administrative or legislative measures declaring the State’s decision to dispossess the
foreign investor. Such direct expropriations have, however, become less frequent,°*’ while
the number of so-called “indirect expropriations” has increased.°** These “indirect
expropriations” are characterized by State interferences — sometimes formalised as
legislative acts of general application, other times as administrative or tax measures — which
result in the destruction or significant erosion of the value of the investor’s assets, without
the outright taking of the property.°?

697.

x

Article 6(1) of the BIT acknowledges this shift and (like most bilateral and multilateral
investment treaties) extends the scope of protection to cover indirect expropriations, defined
as “measure[s] having the same nature or the same effect” as an expropriation or

nationalisation. Other treaties use similar definitions, referring to “measures equivalent to”
or “tantamount to” expropriation.“° Whatever the precise wording, when treaties use these
terms, they refer to measures which substantially deprive the investor of the fundamental
attributes of property, including the right to use, enjoy and dispose of its investment, without
formal transfer of title or outright seizure.™!

B. Discussion
698. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent.

699. Neither the decision of Benice to request the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change, nor the
decision of the Assembly to terminate the procurement provoked an indirect expropriation
of Claimants’ protected investments. The Tribunal grounds its decision on the following
reasons:

700. First, the Tribunal notes that Claimants purchased the land before it was re-zoned for
residential use. The land the subject of the purchases was land designated as agricultural,
forest and for recreational use.

701. The Zoning Plan Change, which would have authorised residential development, was
approved in 2010, two years after the purchases, but the decision of the Assembly never
became final and definitive, there being a two-year statute of limitations for annulment
requests. Within that period of limitations, Benice and two affected neighbours filed the
Request for Annulment, and the Courts eventually decided that the Zoning Plan Change was
contrary to Czech law and it had to be annulled. The Assembly then decided not to re-procure
the Zoning Plan Change, leaving the land with the same zoning designation which it had at
the time of the purchase.

702. The summary of the facts shows that Projekt Sever never had an acquired right that the
Project Area be considered as residential. At best, after the initial approval of the Zoning
Plan Change by the Assembly, it had an expectation that, if the period of limitation lapsed
and no annulment request was filed (or the request was filed but rejected), the approval
would become final, and the land would then definitively be considered as zoned for
residential use.

703. But that expectation did not materialize.

640 There is widespread inconsistency in the terms used to describe these legal concepts; but it is commonly held that
“indirect”, “creeping”, “de facto”, “disguised”, and “regulatory” expropriation are used interchangeably. See
P Muchlinski, F Ortino and C Schreuer, The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law, 2008, p. 422;
C McLachlan, L Shore, and M Weiniger, International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles, Oxford 2007,
CL-I, p. 292.

41 See e.g., the definition contained in the C Economic and Trade t (CETA) between Canada,
and the European Union and its Member States, 30 October 2016, Annex 8-A, 1(b).

 

 

150

704.

705.

706.

707.

708.

Thus, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent, and finds that the only rights acquired by
Claimants through their land purchases were property rights over agricultural, forest and
recreational land.”

Second, even if Claimants had acquired a specific right for the Project Area to be zoned for
residential use (quod non), Claimants have still failed to prove any interference with their
property rights that would be sufficiently restrictive, permanent and irreversible to justify a
finding of indirect expropriation.

As noted by Respondent, Claimants remain the owners of the same land that they purchased
in 2007 and they remain entitled to initiate a procedure that could lead to a future zoning
change.®? Although the short-term political climate may have worked against Claimants,
there is still a possibility that the land may eventually be designated as residential.“!+ The
Tribunal notes that Claimants themselves acknowledge that the new draft Metropolitan Plan
designates at least 10% of the Project Area as susceptible to development.

RK

In view of the above, the Tribunal dismisses Claimants’ claims of indirect expropriation
under Article 6 of the BIT.

In summary, the Arbitral Tribunal has only found one violation of the BIT attributable to the
Czech Republic: the payment requests made to Projekt Sever on behalf of Benice District
were unreasonable pursuant to Article 4(1) of the BIT. They also fall short of the standard
of Fair and Equitable Treatment that Article 4(2) requires the Respondent to ensure.

VIII. REPARATION
In this section the Tribunal will discuss the reparation due to Claimants as a consequence of
the breach committed by the Czech Republic in violation of its Treaty obligations.
POSITION OF CLAIMANTS
According to Claimants, a State must make full reparation if it commits an international

wrong. Reparations must wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the
situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.°

. Claimants argue that Respondent must pay monetary compensation sufficient to compensate

them in full for the loss caused by the Respondent’s violations of the BIT, including
compensation for lost profits.”

Claimants rely on their economic expert, Mr. Kai F. Schumacher of AlixPartners, for their
assessment of the quantum of the damages caused by their inability to realise the
development of the Residential Complex Benice.“*

Mr. Schumacher’s analysis concluded that the Claimants’ total damages amount to CZK
4,950,382,717 as of the valuation date specified in the report (31 July 2020).°*?

According to Claimants, these damages represent the lost profits that Claimants would have
received, had the Residential Complex Benice been successfully developed, as well as
damages suffered by the Claimants due to the loss in the value of the land acquired for the
development.°°

In their Post Hearing Brief, Claimants updated the quantum of their claim for damages,
requesting that the Tribunal award compensation, including pre-award interest as of 31 July
2020, in the amount of CZK 5,266,622,342.°°!

POSITION OF RESPONDENT.
According to the Czech Republic, the damages alleged by Claimants are not recoverable

under the settled principle of international law that hypothetical or speculative damages are
not recoverable.°

717. Respondent argues that Claimants’ claims for loss of profit are purely speculative, noting
that those claims are dependent on at least six successive steps and that Claimants have not
proven that those steps would have more likely than not been fulfilled.*?

718. According to Respondent, Claimants’ arguments on damages skip over two critical steps:

   

= that losses must be proven with “sufficient certainty to be compensable,”°* and

- that the harm must be caused by the respondent State.°>
719. Thus, according to Respondent, Claimants have failed to prove that they actually suffered
any loss, because the Project and its realisation remained nothing more than a concept.°°

720. With respect to Claimants’ claims for loss of land value, Respondent argues that these claims
must also fail, because there has been no actual loss: Claimants purchased agricultural land
in 2007-2008 and they still own that agricultural land today. While it is true that Claimants
paid a higher price for that land as prospective building land, it still may be considered as
prospective building land.’

3. DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL
721. The Tribunal has accepted one of Claimants’ claims, while it has dismissed the remainder.

722. The claim accepted by the Tribunal relates to Mayor Topicova’s requests, on behalf of the
District of Benice, demanding significant payments from Projekt Sever as quid pro quo for
the withdrawal of the Benice Lawsuit filed by the District against Projekt Sever, and for the
District’s change of position regarding the increase in the density coefficient. In the opinion
of the Tribunal, this conduct resulted in the breach of the specific prohibition of unreasonable
measures established in Article 4(1) and of the general FET standard guaranteed in Article
4(2) of the BIT.

 

The consequences of internationally wrongful acts
723. Article 30 of the ILC defines the first obligation arising from internationally wrongful acts:

= the State is obliged to cease that act, if it is ongoing, and

653 R-PHB, para. 243.

654 R-II, para. 496, referring to International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Respons
Internationally Wrongful Acts, with Commentaries, 2001, CL-5, Article 36, comment 27 (“In s where lost future
profits have been awarded, it has been where an anticipated income stream has attained sufficient attributes to be
considered a legally protected interest of sufficient certainty to be compensable”); M. Whiteman, Damages in
International Law, Vol. III, Government Printing Office Washington (excerpts), 1943, RL-120, p. 1837; UNIDROIT
Principles of International Commercial Contracts, 2010, RL-121, Article 7.4.3(1); United Nations Compensation

lity of States for

724.

725.

circumstances so require.

The Tribunal notes that the wrongful act is not ongoing, and that Claimants do not seek
assurances or guarantees that it will not be repeated.

As a second consequence, Article 31 of the ILC Articles requires that the delinquent State
make “full reparation” for the “injury caused”:

“Article 31 Reparation

1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury
caused by the international wrongful act.

2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally
wrongful act of a State”

726. Article 36 of the ILC Articles then establishes that full reparation may take three forms:

Restitution, which in accordance with Article 35 requires the situation which existed
before the wrongful act was committed to be re-established;

Compensation for the damages caused, which under Article 36, include loss of profits
insofar as they are established; and

Satisfaction, which may consist in an acknowledgement of the breach, an expression of
regret, a formal apology, or another appropriate modality, as established in Article 37.

727. In the present case, Claimants are requesting full reparation in two forms:°*

728.

First, Claimants are requesting compensation for the damages caused, including the loss
in the value of the land acquired for the development and loss of profits and interest, in an
amount of CZK 5,266,622,342 (A.), and

Second, Claimants also seek a declaration by the Tribunal that “the Czech Republic’s
actions and omissions at issue, including those of its instrumentalities for which it is
internationally responsible” violated Article 4 of the BIT by “failing to treat Claimants’
investments fairly and equitably” and by “impairing Claimants’ investments through
unreasonable and discriminatory measures” (B.).

Compensation

The duty to make reparation extends only to those damages which have been proven by the
injured party and which are legally regarded as the consequence of the wrongful act. It is a
general principle of international law that injured claimants bear the burden of
demonstrating:

8 C_PHB, p. 2/76.

154

- That the claimed quantum of damage was actually suffered, and

- that such damages flowed from the host State’s conduct, and that the causal relationship
was sufficiently close (i.e., not “too remote”).°?

729. Article 36.1 of the ILC Articles reflects this general principle:

“The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to
compensate for the damage caused thereby [...]” [Emphasis added]

 

730. Claimants fail on both counts:

731. First, Claimants have failed to prove that the wrongful acts of the Czech Republic caused
any damage at all.

732. The wrongful conduct attributable to the Czech Republic consists in the Mayor of Benice’s
irregular and improper requests demanding that Claimants make significant payments in
return for the withdrawal of the Benice Lawsuit filed by the District against Projekt Sever,
and for the District’s change of position with respect to the increase in the density coefficient.
Claimants (to their credit) refused to make the wrongful payments.

733. There is no evidence that the internationally wrongful conduct attributable to the Czech
Republic caused any harm to Claimants:

- Mayor Topiéova did not withdraw the Benice Lawsuit, but the action was dismissed on 8
March 2012 by the District Court, and Benice’s subsequent appeal was also dismissed; °°
Projekt Sever does not allege that it has suffered any harm due to the filing and subsequent
dismissal of the Benice Lawsuit, nor is there any evidence in the file to suggest that it did;

- Mayor Topiéova voluntarily changed her position regarding the density coefficients, and
Benice finally supported Projekt Sever’s request for an increase in May 201 1— preempting
any claim for damages.°°!

734. Second, Claimants seek compensation for the damages allegedly caused, including loss of
profits and interest, in an amount of CZK 5,266,622,342 — a quantum established with the
support of their expert, AlixPartners.

735. Claimant’s alleged damages are based on the premise that the Annulment Decision adopted
by the Czech Courts, and the subsequent decision by the Prague City Assembly to terminate
the re-procurement of the Zoning Change, destroyed the value of Claimants’ investment and
left Projekt Sever with agricultural and forest land and land for recreational use that could
not be used for the development of the Benice Housing Complex.°

66:

The problem with this quantification is that it assumes that the damage was caused by two
events, which the Tribunal has found do not constitute internationally wrongful acts
attributable to the Czech Republic:

The filing by the District of Benice of the Annulment Request, and the subsequent
adoption of the Annulment Decision by the Czech Courts, which annulled the Zoning Plan
Change, °°?

And the decision by the Prague City Assembly not to re-procure the annulled Zoning Plan
Change, with the consequence that the Project Area would continue to be zoned for
agricultural, forest and recreational use.

Thus, the Tribunal does not find any causal link between the internationally wrongful
conduct attributable to Respondent and the damages claimed by Claimants.

Satisfaction

A State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to
give satisfaction for the injury caused, if requested by the injured, and insofar as the injury
cannot be remedied by restitution or compensation. The only limitation (identified in Article
37(3) of the ILC Articles) is that the satisfaction shall not be out of proportion to the injury
and may not take a form humiliating to the responsible State.

The Tribunal has already dismissed Claimants’ request for compensation, and notes that
restitution has not been requested (and is not feasible, given the nature of the wrongful act).
Claimants do request a form of satisfaction, a declaration by the Tribunal that the Czech
Republic has committed a violation of Article 4 of the BIT.

The Tribunal finds that such a declaration is proportionate to the injury caused, is not
humiliating for the responsible State, and consequently agrees to give satisfaction to
Claimants, by making the appropriate declaration in the dispositif of this Award (excluding
any reference to discriminatory conduct, since the Tribunal has dismissed Claimants’ claims
regarding discrimination).

HK

Summing up, the Tribunal dismisses Claimants’ claim for compensation, due to a lack of
substantiation and the absence of causation. Conversely, the Tribunal accepts Claimants’
claim for satisfaction in the form of a declaration by the Tribunal, to be inserted in the
dispositif of this Award, that the Czech Republic has committed an internationally wrongful
act consisting of a violation of Article 4 of the BIT.

IX. COSTS

742. Rule 47(1)(j) of the Arbitration Rules establishes that:

“The award shall be in writing and shall contain [...] (j) any decision of the Tribunal
regarding the cost of the proceeding.”

743. The Parties submitted their statements of cost on 6 August 2020. None of the Parties
challenged the items or the amounts claimed by the counterparty. On 24 February 2021, the
Czech Republic submitted a statement containing an updated certification of costs.

744. The Parties have incurred two main categories of costs:

- the lodging fee and advance on costs paid to ICSID (the “Costs of the Proceeding”; and

- the expenses incurred by the Parties to further their position in the arbitration (the “Legal
Fees and Expenses”).

DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL
Article 9(2)(d) of the BIT provides that:

“Each party to the dispute shall bear the costs of its own member of the tribunal and of
its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the costs of the chairman and the remaining
cost shall be borne in equal parts by both parties to the dispute. The tribunal may,
however, in its award decide on a different proportion of costs to be borne by the parties
and this award shall be binding on both parties.”

Additionally, Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:

“In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise
agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings,
and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the
members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall
be paid.”

Both Parties have requested that the other bear the costs of the proceedings based on the

principle that “costs follow the event.”

However, the Tribunal finds that it is more appropriate, given the circumstances of this case,

to apply the default rule provided in Article 9(2)(d) of the BIT.

As regards the outcome of this procedure, the Tribunal finds that each Party has succeeded

in part:

The Respondent has succeeded, because the Tribunal dismissed two of Claimants’ three
claims under Article 4 and dismissed Claimants’ two additional claims under Article 3 and
Article 6.

But Claimants have also succeeded, to the extent that the Tribunal dismissed all of
Respondent’s jurisdictional objections, and partially accepted their claim that the Czech
Republic had committed an internationally wrongful act.

759. While Article 9(2)(d) grants the Tribunal the discretion to “decide on a different proportion

of costs to be borne by the parties”, in this arbitration the Tribunal finds that both Parties

159

have conducted themselves appropriately, with neither side raising the costs of the
proceeding disproportionately.

ROK
760. In view of the above, the Tribunal determines that:
= each Party shall bear, in equal parts, the Costs of the Proceeding; and

- each Party shall be responsible for its own Legal Fees and Expenses.

160

X. AWARD

761. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:

1. DISMISSES the jurisdictional objections submitted by the Czech Republic and declares
that the present dispute falls within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the
Tribunal.

2. DECLARES that the Czech Republic has violated Article 4 of the BIT by failing to treat
Claimants’ investments fairly and equitably and by impairing Claimants’ investments
through unreasonable measures.

3. DECLARES that each Party shall bear, in equal parts, the Costs of the Proceeding and
that each Party shall be responsible for its own Legal Fees and Expenses.

4. DISMISSES all other claims and requests.
