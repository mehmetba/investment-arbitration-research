Award
INTRODUCTION
THE PARTIES
1. The Claimants are Stans Energy Corp (“Stans Energy” or “Stans”), and Kutisay

Mining Limited Liability Company (“Kutisay Mining LLC”, together with Stans Energy,
“Claimants”). Stans Energy is a publicly-traded company incorporated under the laws of Ontario,
Canada. It directly and wholly owns Stans Energy KG LLC (“Stans KG”), a limited liability
company registered under the laws of the Kyrgyz Republic. Kutisay Mining LLC is a limited
liability company registered under the laws of the Kyrgyz Republic and owned by Stans KG.!

2. The Claimants are represented in this arbitration by Mr. Nigel Blackaby, Mr. Noah
Rubins, Ms. Mariia Puchyna, Mr. Simon Consedine, Dr. Daniel Miiller and Ms. Shirin Chua of
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.

3. The Respondent is the Kyrgyz Republic (“Respondent” or “Republic” or
“Kyrgyzstan”).

4. The Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Dr. Andrei Yakovlev, Mr. Wilson
Antoon, Ms. Dorothy Murray, Mr. Alexis Namdar, Ms. Dina Suliman and Mr. Marco Toracca of
King & Wood Mallesons; Mr. Anvar Askarov and Mr. Ulan Satarov of Satarov, Askarov &
Partners; and Mr. Aiaz Baetov and Mr. Mirlan Dordoev of the Center for Court Representation

of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic;

5. The Claimants and the Respondent together are referred to as the “Parties”.

THE TRIBUNAL’S TERMINOLOGY AND REASONING

6. The Tribunal has carefully examined all the arguments and evidence presented by the
Parties throughout these proceedings. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to reiterate in
this Award all such arguments or evidence, which are well-known to the Parties. Further, insofar
as any matter has not been specifically identified or recorded in the body of this Award, this does
not mean that it has not been taken into full consideration. The Tribunal discusses only those

submissions which it considers most relevant for its decisions. The Tribunal’s reasons, without

Claimants’ Notice of Arbitration, at paras 11-14.

PCA 278376

Case 1:20-cv-01795-ABJ Document 1-5 Filed 07/01/20 Page 13 of 280

PCA Case No. 2015-32
Award

repeating all the arguments advanced by the Parties, address what the Tribunal considers to be the

determinative factors required to decide on the Requests of the Parties.

7. The Tribunal’s use of one Party’s terminology is without prejudice to, and in no way
reflects, the Tribunal’s understanding of a particular issue. Rather, effort has been made to use
consistent terminology throughout this Award to facilitate understanding. Likewise, the order in
which references are presented is not a reflection of a particular source’s value in the eyes of the
Tribunal. Instead, effort has been made to format the footnotes consistently and so as to cite all

significant documents referenced by the Parties.

8. The Parties dispute what is the correct English translation of certain provisions of the
Subsoil Laws No. 42 and No. 160 and have submitted different versions of those laws. Similarly,
as regards the Kyrgyz Law On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic, the Parties have submitted
slightly different English translations. Without prejudice, for convenience, the Tribunal in its own
reasoning will generally use and refer to the translations provided by the Claimants. In respect of
the Kyrgyz Law On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic, the Claimants’ translation (CLA-98) is
in relevant parts consistent with the text published by the Kyrgyz Investment Promotion Agency
on its website (CLA-203). In any event, the Tribunal has found that the points in respect of which
the Parties have disputed each other’s translation are not relevant for the application of a certain

provision to the present case.

Cc. THE ESSENCE OF THE CLAIMANTS’ CASE

9. The Claimants bring their claims pursuant to the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic No 66
On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic, dated 27 march 2003 (‘2003 Investment Law”).

10. The Claimants assert the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis of Article 18 of the 2003
Investment Law.” According to the Claimants, they qualify as foreign investors under the 2003
Investment Law, and the Parties have consented to arbitration of the dispute.* Stans Energy’s

to its shareholding in Stans KG and its indirectly-owned investments.* Kutisay Mining LLC
qualifies as a foreign investor under Article 1(3)(2), second alternative, of the 2003 Investment

Law.®

lL. According to the Claimants, the material scope of a tribunal’s jurisdiction under the
2003 Investment Law is broad. The Claimants argue that Article 18 contains the Respondent’s
consent to submit to international arbitration all “investment disputes” with foreign investors.
According to the Claimants, the provision is not limited to disputes based on the substantive
provisions of the 2003 Investment Law;’ as a result, the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
encompasses claims for breaches of the Moscow Convention on the Protection of the Rights of
Investors, signed in Moscow on 28 March 1997 (“Moscow Convention”) and general
international law.* The Claimants argue that the law to be applied by the Tribunal comprises the
2003 Investment Law and other relevant rules of Kyrgyz law and international law, including the
Moscow Convention.” International law should at least be relevant to determine the content of the

obligations assumed by the Respondent.'°

12. The Claimants reject each of the jurisdictional objections put forward by the
Respondent. The Claimants argue that the Respondent has failed to establish that they obtained
the Kutessay II and Kalesay licenses (respectively, “Kutessay II License” and “Kalesay
License”, and collectively, “Licenses”) through corruption.'' The Claimants deny that the 2003
Investment Law contains a “legality requirement”.'? In any event, even if it provided for such
requirement, it would not amount to an absolute bar to jurisdiction. '? Finally, the Claimants argue
that the Respondent has failed to establish any breaches of Kyrgyz law by the Claimants that

would bar the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.'4

13. In substance, the Claimants assert that the Respondent took a series of cumulative and
interconnected measures, starting with a 26 June 2012 Resolution that deprived the Claimants of

the effective use and control of their investments, amounting to an indirect de facto

expropriation. '* This de facto expropriation was later judicially endorsed, and implemented
through the formal revocation of the Licenses on 17 October 2014, amounting to a direct
expropriation of their investments.'® According to the Claimants, the expropriation of their
Licenses occurred arbitrarily, not in the public interest, and without compensation. It was
accordingly in breach of Article 6 of the 2003 Investment Law and international law. '”
Furthermore, the Claimants aver that the Respondent was required to accord them fair and
equitable treatment. '* The Respondent has breached that obligation by frustrating the Claimants’

legitimate expectations and by acting arbitrarily.'”

14. The Claimants assert that Article 6(2) of the 2003 Investment Law does not set out any
express compensation standard for unlawful acts and omissions, including unlawful
expropriations.”° In the absence of a /ex specialis, the Claimants aver that compensation must be
determined in accordance with general international law, which requires “full reparation”.*! To
ensure full reparation, the Claimants argue that the valuation date must be 25 June 2012, the day
before the 26 June 2012 Resolution.” They contend that the appropriate valuation method is the
market capitalisation approach. Accordingly, the value of Stans Energy is to be established
through its share price,” to which it is necessary to add a control premium to reflect the full value
of the company. This results in a fair market value of US$ 128.23 million as at 25 June 2012.”
The Claimants allege that the principle of full reparation also applies to the calculation of
interest.*° The Claimants claim pre-award and post-award interest at a commercial rate of 15.5%
on the basis of the Weighed Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) of Stans Energy,”’ which should

accrue semi-annually on a compounded basis.?*

THE ESSENCE OF THE RESPONDENT’S CASE

15. The Respondent asserts that, in order to rely on the protections of the 2003 Investment
Law, an entity must be an “investor” which has made a “direct investment”. Stans Energy’s
indirect shareholding in Kutisay Mining LLC does not qualify as a “direct investment”.”°
Likewise, Kutisay Mining LLC is not entitled to protection under such law, as it is neither a
“foreign investor” nor an “investor” with a qualifying “direct investment”.*°

16. Additionally, the Respondent argues that the Claimants’ claims must be dismissed due
to illegality, as the Claimants procured the Licenses through corruption and in breach of
fundamental provisions of Kyrgyz law.*! In this regard, the Respondent refers in particular to (1)
Article 183 of the Kyrgyz Criminal Code, which prohibits money laundering; (2) Article 16 of
the Subsoil Law, which sets out requirements for public tenders; and (3) Articles 408 and 409 of

the Kyrgyz Civil Code, which lay out requirements for auctions.*?

17. The Respondent argues that the material scope of jurisdiction of tribunals under the
2003 Investment Law is limited to breaches of the substantive provisions of the 2003 Investment
Law.* Thus, the claims that an investor may bring are strictly limited to breaches of the
provisions of the 2003 Investment Law and, in determining its content, the Tribunal shall refer to
Kyrgyz law principles of statutory interpretation.* In this regard, the Respondent denies that
Article 2(1) of the 2003 Investment Law is an applicable law clause,** with the effect that

international treaties and general international law become applicable to the present arbitration.*°

18. The Respondent denies that the termination of the Licenses amounted to indirect
expropriation. Rather, it was merely the consequence of enforcement of Kyrgyz law in accordance
with a proper legal procedure.*’ Pursuant to a national court decision which found that the
Licenses had been invalidly granted, the Licensing Commission of the State Agency of Geology

and Mineral Resources (“SAGMR”) terminated them under Article 27(5) of the Subsoil Law.**

Kutisay took part in the invalidation procedure and exercised its right to appeal the termination
before national courts. *? Even if the termination measures could be characterised as an
expropriation (which the Respondent denies), the requirements for a lawful expropriation in
Article 6 of the 2003 Investment Law were fulfilled, insofar as the expropriation was (1) provided
for by Kyrgyz law; (2) in the public interest; (3) carried out on a non-discriminatory basis; and
(4) carried out pursuant to a proper legal procedure.“ According to the Respondent, under the
2003 Investment Law, it is not incumbent upon the Republic to offer compensation to an investor
for an expropriation. Rather, it must only make a procedure available to investors through which

they may seek compensation.*!

19. The Respondent argues that there is no normative source for the Claimants’ fair and
equitable treatment claim, since no such standard is amongst the substantive protections of the
2003 Investment Law.” In any event, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants could not have
had any legitimate expectation that the State would not seek to enforce the provisions of the
Subsoil Law;* nor was it reasonable for the Claimants to rely on any of the representations
allegedly made by the head of the Respondent’s Development Fund, Mr. Eliseev, given the factual
circumstances and the presence of numerous “red flags”.** Likewise, the Respondent denies that

it acted arbitrarily and considers that the Claimants’ complaints are without merit.**

20. The Respondent further asserts that, should the Tribunal find that there has been an
expropriation, any damages should be calculated in accordance with Article 6(2) of the 2003
Investment Law," which does not differentiate between lawful and unlawful expropriations.””
According to the Respondent, the Claimants did not suffer any damages because (1) the Licenses
were worthless; (2) the Claimants would not have been able to raise the necessary funds to pursue
mining; and (3) the Licenses were liable to termination due to the Claimants’ persistent breaches

of the License agreements’ terms.** The value of the investment is to be assessed as at the date of

the alleged expropriation decision, 16 October 2014 (the day before the SAGMR terminated the

Licenses).*°

21. In contrast, the Respondent considers that the share price of Stans Energy bore no
relationship to the value of the Licenses, so the only reliable way to value the Licenses is to
develop a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis.*” Should the Tribunal reject that methodology,
the Respondent requests that the Claimants be awarded no damages or, in the alternative, be
awarded only the amounts actually spent on developing the Licenses.*! Pursuant to Article 6(3)
of the 2003 Investment Law, the appropriate interest rate would be a twelve-month LIBOR,* and

would accrue on a simple basis.**

22. Finally, the Respondent contends that any award on damages should be reduced because
(1) the Licenses were liable to be terminated; and (2) the Claimants engaged in wilful or negligent
acts or omissions amounting to contributory fault.“ This calls for a reduction of any damages

awarded by 75%.55

THE SCOPE OF THE PRESENT AWARD

23. By its Request for Bifurcation of Jurisdiction and Merits, the Respondent requested
bifurcation of the proceedings and raised four objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction: (1)
objection regarding the alleged absence of consent; (2) objection regarding the alleged absence
of a protected investor and investment; (3) objection regarding Kutisay Mining LLC’s alleged
non-compliance with the consultation period imposed under the 2003 Investment Law; and (4)

objection regarding the alleged unlawfulness of the acquisition of the Claimants’ investment.

24. In Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal bifurcated the proceedings such that it would
hear the first and third objections (above (1) and (3)) in a preliminary phase and that the other two

objections would be heard in conjunction with the merits.

25. In the jurisdictional phase, the Parties discussed a number of further jurisdictional
objections identified only after the adoption of Procedural Order No. 2. As a result, in its Award
Regarding Bifurcated Objections to Jurisdiction (“Award on Jurisdiction”), the Tribunal
addressed five of these new objections® in conjunction with the two objections identified in
Procedural No. 2, and deferred the remaining jurisdictional issues until the merits phase.*’ The

Tribunal also decided to defer its decision on the costs of the jurisdictional phase to a later stage.**

26. In Procedural Order No. 6, the Tribunal accepted a joint proposal by the Parties for a
procedural timetable, pursuant to which the Respondent would be entitled to “raise any remaining
objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal” in its first written pleading on the merits phase. The
Respondent accordingly submitted several new jurisdictional objections in its Statement of

Defence on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction.”

27. In the present award, therefore, the Tribunal addresses not only the merits of the Parties’
dispute, but also such jurisdictional issues that were not addressed in the Award on Jurisdiction

as well as the costs of arbitration.

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
A COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION

28. On 13 May 2015, pursuant to Article 11 of the Moscow Convention, Article 18 of the

2003 Investment Law, and Article 3 of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission

   

Award on Jurisdiction, at p. 53. Specifically, the Tribunal decided the following jurisdictional questions: (1) whether
the 2003 Investment Law contains the Respondent's consent to arbitrate; (2) whether that legislation must be interpreted
in such a way that one of the Claimants, Kutisay Mining LLC, would not have satisfied the consultation requirement
of that legislation; (3) whether that legislation contains a so-called “fork-in-the-road” clause and, if so, whether it has
been triggered; (4) whether the Kyrgyz Republic (as opposed to one of its “authorised government bodies”) is the right
respondent in arbitration proceedings; and (5) whether “investment disputes” pursuant to that legislation are limited to
disagreements “arising in the course of the sale” of an investment.

Award on Jurisdiction, at p. 53. The Tribunal dismissed the jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent subject
to the exception that “/t/he question whether the Claimants qualify as “investors” holding “investments” under the
relevant Kyrgyz legislation will be considered in conjunction with the merits of the case”.

Award on Jurisdiction, at p. 53. The Tribunal decided that “/aJny decision regarding the costs of the procedure on
jurisdiction is deferred to a later stage of the proceedings’

Statement of Defence on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction, at Sections X, XI and XII(B). The Respondent raised
the following is: : (1) whether the claims should be dismissed because the Claimants acquired their investments
through corruption; (2) whether the claims should be dismissed because the Claimants acquired their investments in
breach of Kyrgyz law; (3) whether the claims should be dismissed because the Claimants pursued them in bad faith;
and (4) whether Article 3(1) of the 2003 Investment Law limits the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to claims brought on the
basis of the substantive provisions of the 2003 Investment Law.

Notice of Arbitration on the Respondent (“Notice of Arbitration”).

29. On 11 June 2015, the Respondent served on the Claimants its Response to the Notice
of Arbitration, in which it indicated that it objected to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and declared
its intention to apply for bifurcation of the proceedings (“Response to the Notice of

Arbitration”).

CONSTITUTION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

30. In the Notice of Arbitration, the Claimants appointed the Honourable Colin L.
Campbell, Q.C., as co-arbitrator.

31. In the Response to the Notice of Arbitration, the Respondent appointed Mr. Stephen

Jagusch, Q.C., as co-arbitrator.

32. On 12 October 2015, the Parties jointly informed the co-arbitrators that they
recommended that Professor Béckstiegel be selected as presiding arbitrator. On 23 October 2015,

the co-arbitrators advised the Parties that they endorsed the appointment of Professor Béckstiegel.

WRITTEN AND ORAL PLEADINGS ON JURISDICTION

33. Following the constitution of the Tribunal, by letter dated 11 November 2015, the

Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on a draft Agenda for a first procedural meeting.

34. On 17 December 2015, both sides submitted proposals for a procedural timetable and
explained their respective positions in respect of the issue of bifurcation. The Respondent
requested that the proceedings be bifurcated without any written exchanges between the Parties
on the issue.“! The Claimants submitted that the Tribunal should consider the question of whether
bifurcation would be in the interest of procedural economy only after the Claimants had filed their

Statement of Claim.”

35. By letter of the same date, the Respondent indicated that “the Parties have agreed to the
removal of a pre-prescribed production of documents phase for jurisdictional arguments, in the

event of bifurcation, with a view to expediting the first stage of the bifurcated proceedings”.

36. Following exchanges between the Tribunal and the Parties, by letter dated
11 January 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that in light of the extent of the agreement
reached between the Parties it had decided not to hold a first procedural meeting. Instead, the
Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, which included the procedural timetable for the initial

phase of the proceedings.

37. On 29 January 2016 the Claimants submitted their Statement of Claim (“Statement of
Claim”).
38. In accordance with the timetable set out in Procedural Order No. 1, on 13 February 2016

the Respondent filed its Request for Bifurcation of Jurisdiction and Merits (“Respondent’s
Request for Bifurcation”) and on 28 February 2016 the Claimants submitted their Response to
the Kyrgyz Republic’s Request for Bifurcation (“Claimants’ Response”).

39. By e-mail of 2 March 2016, the Respondent expressed disagreement with the substance
of the Claimants’ Response, and conveyed its wish to provide a reply within the framework of
the procedural schedule if invited to do so by the Tribunal. By e-mail of 3 March 2016, the
Claimants objected to the Respondent’s request, submitting that Procedural Order No. | only
provided for a single exchange on the question of bifurcation, and that any additional round would

cause delay. On the same date, the Respondent responded by e-mail to clarify its position.

40. By e-mail dated 7 March 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, having reviewed
the Parties’ correspondence and submissions, it did not regard further briefing on the question of

bifurcation as necessary.

41. On 14 March 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, in which the Tribunal
decided, inter alia, that the proceedings would be bifurcated and identified the jurisdictional

objections that would be heard in a preliminary phase.

42. By letter dated 1 April 2016, the Respondent, having become aware that the Claimants
relied on third party funding in the context of the present arbitration, invited the Claimants to

provide either “adequate security for costs” or evidence of “available assets that [would] enable

the Respondent to pursue a costs award” and, in any event, to disclose the Litigation Funding
Agreement between the Claimants and Calunius Capital LLP relating to their claim in this
arbitration (“Funding Agreement”). The Respondent noted that it would make an application to
the Tribunal without further notice should its invitation be rejected or no satisfactory response be

provided by 6 April 2016.

43. On 5 April 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, in which it fixed the

procedural timetable for the jurisdictional phase.

44, By letter dated 6 April 2016, the Claimants informed the Respondent that they were not
prepared to provide security for costs or evidence of available assets, nor to disclose the Funding

Agreement.

45. On 25 April 2016, the Respondent submitted its Application for Security for Costs and
Disclosure of the Claimants’ Litigation Funding Agreement (“Respondent’s Application for
Security”), seeking “an order from the Tribunal directing that the proceedings continue subject
to the Claimants furnishing suitable security for the Respondent’s costs, and disclosing the

Funding Agreement”.

 

46. On 13 May 2016, the Respondent filed its Statement of Defence on Jurisdiction in
Bifurcated Pi dings (“Respondent’s ission on Jurisdiction”).
47. On 20 May 2016, the Claimants submitted their Response to the Respondent’s

Application for Security for Costs and Disclosure of the Litigation Funding Agreement
(“Response”).

48. By letter dated 3 June 2016, the Claimants requested a two-day extension for their
submission on jurisdiction. By letter of the same date, the Respondent requested the Tribunal, if
it were to grant the requested extension, to revise the procedural timetable so that it reflected an

appropriate extension of the due date for the Respondent’s reply.

49. By letter dated 6 June 2016, after considering the Parties’ requests, the Tribunal
modified the procedural schedule, granting the extension requested by the Claimants and

extending the due date for the Respondent’s reply accordingly.

50. In accordance with the modified timetable, on 10 June 2016, the Claimants submitted
their Submission on Jurisdiction (“Claimants’ Submission on Jurisdiction’).
51. On 3 July 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, in which it denied the

Respondent’s Application for Security, and deferred the decision regarding the costs related to

this Application to a later stage of the proceedings.

52. On 5 July 2016, the Respondent submitted its Reply on Jurisdiction in Bifurcated

Proceedings (“Respondent’s Reply on Jurisdiction”).

53. On 29 July 2016, the Claimants submitted their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction in Bifurcated

Proceedings (““Claimants’ Rejoinder on Jurisdiction in Bifurcated Proceedings”).

54. On 2 August 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 regarding the Hearing
on Jurisdiction on 23 September 2016, determining certain particulars in preparation of the
hearing.

55. By letter to the Tribunal dated 2 September 2016, the Respondent contended that it had

not had an opportunity to respond to an issue that was pleaded for the first time by the Claimants
in their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction in Bifurcated Proceedings. Accordingly, the Respondent
requested the Tribunal to strike specific paragraphs of the Claimants’ Rejoinder on Jurisdiction
in Bifurcated Proceedings from the record or, in the alternative, to grant the Respondent leave,
pursuant to paragraph 3.1 of Procedural Order No. 5, to submit certain additional documents into

evidence.

56. By letter to the Tribunal dated 5 September 2016, the Claimants argued that the relevant
paragraphs of their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction were in fact responsive to arguments developed by
the Kyrgyz Republic in its Reply on Jurisdiction. The Claimants noted that, in any event, they did
not object to the submission of limited new exhibits, subject to the Claimants’ right to introduce

rebuttal evidence.

57. On 7 September 2016, the Tribunal advised the Parties that the Respondent’s request
that the Tribunal strike certain paragraphs of the Claimants’ Rejoinder on Jurisdiction in
Bifurcated Proceedings was denied. However, the Respondent was granted leave to introduce
certain new exhibits into the record, and the Claimants were invited to submit pertinent rebuttal

evidence, if they so wished, by 14 September 2016.

58. By letter dated 16 September 2016, the Respondent sought the Tribunal’s leave to
introduce a certain number of new exhibits into the record. By letter to the Tribunal dated 20
September 2016, the Claimants stated that they did not object to the submission of the
Respondent’s new exhibits. At the same time, the Claimants also requested the Tribunal’s leave
to introduce a number of new exhibits into the record. By letter to the Tribunal dated 21 September

2016, the Respondent objected to the submission of all but one of the Claimants’ new exhibits.

59. On 22 September 2016, the Tribunal admitted all of the Respondent’s new exhibits into
the record. It also admitted certain new exhibits submitted by the Claimants into the record while

rejecting the remaining exhibits.
60. On 23 September 2016, a Hearing on Jurisdiction was held in Paris.

61. By letter dated 2 October 2016, and further to the Tribunal’s request during the Hearing,
the Respondent made certain clarifications in respect of its argument related to Article 6(3) of the
Law of the Kyrgyz Republic No. 241 On Normative Legal Acts of the Kyrgyz Republic, dated
20 July 2009 (“Law On Normative Legal Acts”), accompanied by additional legal authorities.

62. By letter dated 6 October 2016, the Claimants submitted comments on parts of the
Respondent's letter dated 2 October 2016. At the same time, the Claimants requested the Tribunal
to disregard other paragraphs in the said letter and not to admit some of the accompanying exhibits
(Exhibits RLA-124 to RLA-126). Alternatively, the Claimants requested, in the event that the
Tribunal decided otherwise, to be granted an additional opportunity to respond more fully to the

Respondent's letter.

63. On 10 October 2016, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it had decided to admit in full
the Respondent’s letter of 2 October 2016. Similarly, the accompanying legal authorities, RLA-
124 to RLA-128, were admitted into the record. The Claimants were accordingly invited to
respond to the remaining paragraphs of the Respondent’s letter of 2 October 2016 (as well as
Exhibits RLA-124 to RLA-126) by 13 October 2016.

64. By letter dated 13 October 2016, the Claimants provided their comments on the
Respondent’s letter of 2 October 2016, and submitted additional exhibits and legal authorities.

65. By letter dated 14 October 2016, the Respondent responded to the Claimants’ letter of

of which provides:
In light of the foregoing discussion, the Tribunal unanimously decides:

Tribunal are dismissed subject to the following exception.
b. The question whether the Claimants qualify as “investors” holding “investments”

c. Any decision regarding the costs of the procedure on jurisdiction is deferred to a later
stage of the proceedings.
69. On 22 February 2017, the Respondent applied to the High Court in London pursuant to

Section 67 of the Arbitration Act 1996, requesting that paragraphs 75-80 and 217-236 and Section
VI of the Award on Jurisdiction be set aside and/or varied such that the variation takes effect as
part of the Award so as to provide that the Tribunal has no substantive jurisdiction (“Set-Aside
Claim”). The Respondent informed the Tribunal about the Set-Aside Claim by letter of
23 February 2017.

70. By letter dated 9 March 2017, the Respondent applied for a stay of the present arbitral
proceedings pending the outcome of the Set-Aside Claim (“Respondent’s Application for Stay
of Arbitral Proceedings”), arguing, among others, that significant costs of the arbitral

proceedings could be wasted if the Tribunal continued the proceedings.“

a stay of the proceedings and accept the Joint Proposal for a Procedural Timetable, arguing,

among others, that the High Court would issue a judgment at the end of 2017 at the earliest and
that a further delay of the arbitral proceedings caused by a stay was unjustifiable.®*

72. By letter dated 15 March 2017, the Respondent maintained that a stay was appropriate
pending the outcome of the Set-Aside Claim, stating, among others, that the English High Court
was likely to issue a judgment in September 2017, rather than at the end of 2017.

723. On 15 March 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, whereby the Tribunal
denied the Respondent’s Application to Stay the Proceedings.

Respondent’s Set-Aside Claim had been dismissed by the High Court of England and Wales on
13 October 2017, enclosing a copy of the decision.

objection in relation to Nos 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16 and 34 of the Respondent’s Request to
Produce, and that the Claimants had apparently withdrawn their agreement to produce documents

Nos 28(a) and (b) of the Respondent’s Request to Produce.

88. By e-mail dated 8 September 2017, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to provide any
comments that they might have on the Respondent’s letter of 6 September 2017. By letter of the
same date, the Claimants provided their comments on the Respondent’s letter, stating that the
Claimants had previously raised the same objection in relation to Nos 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13,
16 and 34 of the Respondent’s Request to Produce, and that the Claimants’ request to limit the
scope of production regarding Nos 28(a) and (b) of the Respondent’s Request to Produce was

intended to avoid an unreasonable and disproportionate search.

available to the Respondent since the previous week.

103. On the same date, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to disregard the Respondent’s

new evidence and its accompanying letter.

104. By letter dated 27 February 2018, in view of the nature of the alleged new evidence and
the Respondent’s contention that it became aware of this evidence only the previous week, the
Tribunal (1) provisionally admitted into the record the Witness Statement of Mr. Antonenko,
subject to a later decision by the Tribunal; (2) invited the Claimants to submit any comments and

and rebuttal evidence to the Expert Witness Statement of Mr. Evgenii Shilov; and a second letter

107. By letter dated 6 March 2018, the Tribunal conveyed certain decisions to the Parties

the Respondent to provide an unredacted version of Mr. Antonenko’s Witness Statement to
Claimants’ counsel, on the conditions that access to the unredacted document would be restricted
to Claimants’ counsel at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and any such information would not be
disclosed to anybody beyond Claimants’ counsel; and (3) invited the Respondent to provide any
comments it might have on the Claimants’ statement that they did not intend to call Mr.
Antonenko for cross-examination if the Respondent provided that certain information identified

in their letter be provided.

108. By letter dated 9 March 2018, the Claimants explained the relevance of Exhibits C-318
to C-323 to their case.

109. By letter of the same date, the Respondent objected to the Claimants’ request of an order
for production of the “USSR norms” applied by Mr. Shilov, of Mr. Shilov’s “Labour Journal”,
and of Mr. Shilov’s curriculum vitae, inter alia contending that the Claimants should have made
a prompt reasoned document request before their comments and rebuttal evidence were due on 5
March 2018. Nevertheless, the Respondent indicated it would produce certain relevant USSR
norms which, in any event, were publicly available. Regarding the Claimants’ Exhibits submitted
on 5 March 2018 (C-318 to C-323), the Respondent indicated that it would object to the Claimants
making new arguments at the final hearing that had not been made in the various submissions that
they had been ordered to file in this arbitration. Regarding the Claimants’ request for the provision
of certain information concerning Mr. Antonenko as a condition not to call him for cross-
examination, the Respondent averred that there was no basis for the Claimants to issue

interrogatories to the Respondent.

110. By the same letter, the Respondent also requested that the Tribunal exclude from record
Exhibits C-316 and C-317, submitted by the Claimants with their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, on

the basis that these documents did not concern any jurisdictional issue.

111. On 12 March 2018, the Claimants submitted a letter in response to the Respondent’s
letter dated 9 March 2018. The Claimants asserted that their request for the production of the
USSR norms and Mr. Shilov’s Labour Journal were timely, noted that the documents provided
by the Respondent were irrelevant and untranslated. The Claimants argued that their requests for
information in relation to Mr. Antonenko were entirely reasonable questions and would alleviate

the need to call him from cross-examination. Finally, the Claimants contended that Exhibits C-

316 and C-317 formed part of an email chain already submitted as evidence by the Respondent
as Exhibits R-408 to R-414.

112. By letter dated 12 March 2018, the Respondent noted the Parties’ inability to reach an
agreement in connection with certain differences in translations submitted by the Parties. The
Respondent requested that the Tribunal confirm its entitlement to challenge and make
submissions in respect of the Claimants’ translations at the final hearing. The Respondent also
requested leave to admit into the record Exhibit R-498, consisting in a Russian-English dictionary

entry for the term of “npoext” (“project”).

113. On 12 March 2018, the Tribunal provided the Parties with a draft of Procedural Order
No. 8 regarding details of the Hearing, inviting comments from the Parties by 19 March 2018.

114. By letter dated 13 March 2018, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal exclude
Exhibits C-318 to C-323 from the record, arguing that the Claimants had failed, in their letter
dated 9 March 2018, properly to explain the relevance of these new Exhibits to the Claimants’

allegations, and on what basis they would constitute a rebuttal of the Shilov Report.

115. By letter dated 15 March 2018, the Claimants requested that all outstanding procedural
issues be resolved by the Tribunal at the outset of the Hearing on 9 April or at a short pre-hearing
conference, if necessary. As regards to the contested translations, the Claimants pointed out that
this issue only became disputed after the Respondent’s Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on
Jurisdiction was submitted, and that they had never disputed the Respondent’s right to challenge
the accuracy of the translations in accordance with Article 16.4 of Procedural Order No. 1. The
Claimants objected to the Respondent’s attempt to introduce Exhibit R-498 into the record. In the
event that the Tribunal were to admit this Exhibit, the Claimants announced that they would
request permission to submit new evidence in response. With regard to Exhibits C-318 to C-323,
the Claimants averred that all of these Exhibits were relevant to the Shilov Report, as well as to
the points that the Respondent would likely develop at the Hearing based on that Report. The
Claimants also noted that one of the witnesses called for cross-examination by the Respondent,
Mr. Rodney Irwin, had recently undergone neurosurgery and would be seeking on 23 March 2018
an specialist’s opinion as to whether we was fit to travel and/or to be cross-examined. Finally, the
Claimants sought the Tribunal’s leave to submit as evidence a letter from Mr. Savchenko

explaining his reasons for declining to participate in these proceedings as a witness.

116. On 16 March 2018, the Claimants submitted a letter from clinical neuropsychologist

Dr. Rees assessing Mr. Rodney Irwin’s cognitive ability to testify as a witness during the Hearing.

117. By letter dated 16 March 2018, the Respondent objected to the Claimants’ application
for leave to introduce a letter by Mr. Savchenko into the record. In the event that the Tribunal

were to admit the letter, the Respondent requested permission to submit evidence in response.

118. By letter dated 19 March 2018, the Tribunal conveyed to the Parties its decisions
regarding the outstanding procedural issues. The Tribunal decided as follows: (1) Exhibits C-316
and C-317 were admitted into the record; (2) Exhibits C-318 to C-323 could be used at the Hearing
only in relation to issues touched upon by the Shilov Report; (3) the Claimants’ request of an
order for the production of the USSR norms and Mr. Shilov’s Labour Journal was denied; (4) the
Tribunal decided not to formally order the Respondent to disclose the information requested by
the Claimants in relation to Mr. Antonenko’s Witness Statement, and invited the Claimants to
indicate whether they still wished to call Mr. Antonenko for cross-examination by 21 March 2018;
(5) the Tribunal confirmed that it remained open to the Parties to comment on the appropriateness
of different translations at the Hearing as foreseen in Procedural Order No. 1, decided to admit
Exhibit R-498 into the record, and, while it did not order the preparation of a certified translation,
it reserved the right to do so, including if it would find at or after the Hearing that the differences
in translation should be further clarified; (6) the Tribunal invited the Respondent to provide any
comments on the Claimants’ information concerning the availability of Mr. Irwin for cross-
examination at the Hearing; and (7) the Tribunal noted the Parties’ positions regarding the
Claimants’ request of leave to introduce into the record a letter from Mr. Savchenko, and

announced that it would shortly revert to the Parties with a decision in this regard.

119. On 19 March 2018, the Parties submitted their comments with regard to draft Procedural
Order No. 8 regarding details of the Hearing. Taking the Parties’ comments into account, the

Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 in its final form on 20 March 2018.

120. By letter dated 21 March 2018, the Respondent provided its comments on the

availability of Mr. Irwin for cross-examination at the Hearing.

provided an agreed scheduling proposal indicating the order of appearance of witnesses and

approximate timing of breaks.

122. By letter of 26 March 2018, the Claimants provided an updated chronological index of
the Claimants’ Factual Exhibits.

123. By letter dated 28 March 2018, the Claimants confirmed that Mr. Irwin was able to
attend the Hearing.

124. By letter dated 28 March 2018, the Tribunal conveyed to the Parties, inter alia, that the

Claimants’ request for leave to introduce into the record a letter from Mr. Savchenko was denied.

125. On 28 March 2018, the PCA invited the Parties to confirm whether, pursuant to section
15.4 of Procedural Order No. 1, interpretation services which might be required at the Hearing
had been arranged by the Parties. On the same date, the Respondent confirmed that the Parties
had arranged interpretation services for the Hearing. On 29 March 2018, the Claimants confirmed

the Parties’ arrangement in this regard.

On 19 April 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9, Regarding Post-Hearing

they might address in their post-hearing briefs:

PCA 278376

Jurisdiction

1. Assuming that the Tribunal accepts the scheme described by Mr. Beysheyev in his
witness testimony as true, what is the evidence on the record that the Claimants (i) were
aware or (ii) could have been expected to be aware of it? Based on that evidence, what are
the legal consequences for the Claimants’ claims in these proceedings?

2. Assuming that the Tribunal concludes that the 29 December 2009 auction at the Central
Asian Stock Exchange was contrary to Kyrgyz law, what is the evidence on the record that
the Claimants (i) were aware or (ii) could have been expected to be aware of such
unlawfulness? What would be the legal consequence if the auction was contrary to Kyrgyz
law but the Claimants were unaware of it?

Merits

3. Was the Government legally entitled to revoke License No. 3, as a result of Kutisay
Mining LLC’s failure to comply with the terms of the Kutessay II License Agreement No.
3? Assuming that the Government was legally entitled to revoke the License, does there
remain scope for compensation claims under the 2003 Investment Law in view of the work
completed by the Claimants since 2009?

4. Assuming that the Tribunal adopts a market capitalization approach on damages
(consistently with the Claimants’ submission), what would be the amount of damages on the
following hypothetical valuation dates: (i) 25 June 2012; (ii) 14 April 2013; (iii) 16 October
2014.

5. Assuming that the Tribunal adopts an income approach on damages based on DCF
analysis (consistently with the Respondent’s primary submission), what would be the amount
of damages on the following hypothetical valuation dates: (i) 25 June 2012; (ii) 14 April
2013; (iii) 16 October 2014. To demonstrate the sensitivity of their models to particular
parameters, the Parties are requested to indicate a value range for each valuation date,
explaining how the results would change if the following inputs are used:

 

Parameter <= Range =>
Extraction rate 62.56% 72% (accounting for new
processes that might have
been introduced following

Should additional inputs be required, the Parties are requested to base their assessment on the
information described in the AsiaRud reports.

6. Assuming that the Tribunal adopts a sunk costs approach on damages (consistently with
the Respondent’s submission in the alternative), what are the amounts expended by the
Claimants by (i) 14 April 2013 and (ii) 16 October 2014? What is the evidence on the record
that such expenditures were incurred?

7. The Parties’ experts have conceded that each of them had less then optimal information
for valuation purposes, which seems to have been a main reason for rejecting the
methodology of the opposing side’s expert (namely that the opposing methodology was
inappropriate given the lack of information). If the Tribunal were to consider that in this case
there is insufficient information for conventional valuation methodologies, what principles,
if any, exist in international law to award damages for the loss of the investment and the
chance to achieve its objective that a claimant has suffered as a result ofa taking? If there are
any such principles, how are they to be applied, and is there a difference in measurement of
damages between lawful expropriation and unlawful expropriation?

141. By letter dated 18 May 2018, pursuant to section 2.3 of Procedural Order No. 9, the

Claimants requested leave to submit new documents into the record.

142. On 21 May 2018, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that, in order to properly
consider the Claimants’ application, the Respondent had requested copies of the new documents,
following the receipt of which, the Respondent requested to be afforded an opportunity to consider

and, if necessary, comment on the Claimants’ application.

143. On 22 May 2018, in order to provide the Respondent with a meaningful opportunity to
comment on the Claimants’ request for leave to introduce new documents into the record, the
Tribunal invited the Claimants to share the documents in question with the Respondent, and
requested the Respondent to submit any comments it may have within three days after the receipt
of the documents. In case a decision from the Tribunal were to be required, the Claimants were
requested to share the documents in question with the Tribunal to enable the latter to appreciate

the Respondent’s comments.

144. On the same date, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they had shared copies of
the documents referred to in the Claimants’ request for leave and which were already in their
possession with the Respondent, and had also informed the Respondent that they were in the

process of collating documents which they would share as soon as they were received.

145. By letter dated 25 May 2018, the Respondent provided comments in response to the

Claimants’ request, enclosing copies of the new documents and other documents.

146. By letter dated 28 May 2018, the Tribunal decided that: ““1) All documents mentioned
in the Claimants’ application are admitted into the record; 2) The Respondent is given leave to
submit, with its Post-Hearing Brief, any new documents it considers relevant in rebuttal to the
Claimants’ new documents or to the questions of the Tribunal in the Annex to Procedural Order
No. 9; 3) The Parties may comment on the new documents submitted by the other side in their

second-round Post-Hearing Briefs, due by 13 July 2018.”

147. On 7 June 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had reached agreement on
the extension of the deadlines set out in Procedural Order No. 9. On the same date, the Tribunal

confirmed that the requested extensions were approved.

148. On 29 June 2018, both sides simultaneously submitted their Post-Hearing Briefs with

enclosures.

149. On 17 August 2018, both sides simultaneously submitted their Reply Post-Hearing

Briefs with enclosures.

150. By letter dated 21 August 2018, the Respondent objected to portions of the Claimants’
Reply Post-Hearing Brief, notably in respect of a new argument on estoppel presented by the

Claimants therein, and certain new evidence and requested that these be struck from the record.

151. On 29 August 2018, the Tribunal indicated that it took the Respondent’s objection to
portions of the Claimants’ Reply Post-Hearing Brief and certain evidence relied upon by the
Claimants under advisement. The Tribunal would consider and take a decision on the
admissibility of these materials in the context of its deliberations in respect of the Award in the

present proceedings.

152. On 26 September 2018, the Parties conveyed their agreement to extend the deadlines
for the Submissions on Costs and the Comments on opposing side’s Submissions on Costs. On

27 September 2018, the Tribunal approved the extension requested by the Parties.

153. On 5 October 2018, both sides simultaneously filed their Submissions on Costs.

the Claimants seek a declaration that the full protection and security standard has been breached. Nowhere in the
Statement of Claim do the Claimants even attempt to explain: 774.1 the legal basis on which they would be entitled to
bring such a claim; or 744.2 how this standard was breached. 745. The Claimants bear the burden of proof in
establishing their claims, which burden the Claimants have clearly not met. Such a claim should therefore be
dismissed”. [footnotes omitted]

SUMMARY OF RELEVANT FACTS

163. The Parties’ dispute arises from efforts by Stans Energy to invest in two mines for the
extraction of so-called rare earth elements in the Kyrgyz Republic. Both sides have described the
factual background in great detail. In the following, the Tribunal shall summarize these facts only

insofar as the Tribunal regards it as necessary for its decision.

RARE EARTH ELEMENTS MARKETS

164. Rare earth elements (“REEs”) are comprised of chemical elements, which are useful in
a wide variety of applications including batteries, catalysts, magnets, and phosphors.” There are

two categories of REEs: (1) light rare-earth elements (“LREEs”) and (2) heavy rare-earth

elements (“HREEs”).*° As the word “rare” indicates, it is difficult to find ore deposits containing

sufficient amounts of REEs for commercial exploitation.*!

165. The global production of REEs started increasing in the 1950s and 1960s.*? According
to the US Geological Survey Factsheet 087-02,*° at that time, countries other than the United
States and China dominantly supplied REEs produced from Monazite-placers.™ In the mid-
1960s, Mountain Pass, mine in California, the United States, began REEs production and
remained as the largest REEs mine until the mid-1980s, when China began increasing its REEs
production.** China became the largest REEs supplier in the early 1990s, and established its

dominant position in the early 2000s.*°

Geological Survey, “2012 Minerals Yearbook — Rare Earths”, February 2015, at p. 60.1. (Exhibit C-153): “The LREEs
are lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, and gadolinium. The HREEs
include terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium. The properties of scandium do not
allow it to be classified as either a LREE or a HREE”.

166. REEs prices remained low until 2009, when China introduced an export quota on its
REEs exports.*’ REEs prices rose significantly from 2010, and peaked in April 2011.** Since
then, however, REEs prices have dropped significantly, once Chinese export restrictions were

eased.”

167. The Parties have different views regarding the prospect of REEs business of today. The
Claimants allege that, because China dominates the worldwide REEs supply, “there continues to
be significant strategic value in non-Chinese deposits capable of commercial production of
REEs”.” The Respondent, on the contrary, alleges that the REEs business is no longer profitable

as the global REEs market is expected to continue to decline until at least 2018.°!

THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

168. The Kyrgyz Republic is a country in Central Asia. It formed part of the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics (“USSR”) together with other 14 republics until 1991.°? On 25 December
1991, following the disestablishment of the USSR, the Kyrgyz Republic declared independence.”

169. The first president of the Kyrgyz Republic was Askar Akayev, whose presidency
continued until the Tulip Revolution of 2005.° The successor of Mr. Akayev was Kurmanbek
Bakiev.°> Mr. Bakiev was in office until April 2010, when protests against his presidency spread
throughout the country and opposition leaders established an interim government.” On 15 April

2010, Mr. Bakiev resigned and fled to Belarus.°”

170. In June 2010, a new Constitution was approved in a national referendum. Pursuant to
this new Constitution, parliamentary elections were held in October 2010 and a new government
was formed in December 2010.°

171. The Respondent alleges that the Bakiev regime was corrupt.” According to the
Respondent, bribes were laundered through AsiaUniversalBank (“AUB”),'°° a Kyrgyz bank
incorporated in August 1997, and the Claimants obtained their mining licenses through this

money laundering scheme.'°! The Claimants, however, deny any involvement in corruption.'”

STANS ENERGY’S INVESTMENTS IN THE KYRGYZ REES SECTOR

172. Beginning in 2005, the Claimants made various investments in the Kyrgyz Republic.
Following initial investments by the Claimants in the uranium sector, they proceeded to acquire
investments in the REEs sector. It is the alleged expropriation of these latter investments that

partner, Mr. Albert Grenke, decided to invest in the Kyrgyz uranium sector.'™ In July 2005, they
identified three potential uranium properties: (1) Shaltin, (2) Kyzyluraan; and (3) Kapkatash.'°°
According to the First Witness Statement of Mr. Aryev, in the fall of 2005, they obtained
prospecting licenses for the three uranium properties from the SAGMR through Viol Grand Ltd,
a Kyrgyz company that Mr. Aryev and Mr. Grenke had acquired. !°°

174. On 26 September 2005, Stans Energy was incorporated under the laws of Ontario,
Canada, for the purpose of investing the Kyrgyz uranium sector.'"’ According to the First Witness

Statement of Mr. Aryev, the founding directors were Mr. Aryev and Mr. Robert Mackay, a

Toronto-based financier.'°*

175. In March 2006, Stans Energy incorporated its local subsidiary in the Kyrgyz Republic,
Stans KG, to hold its assets, including the licenses which had been previously acquired by Viol

Grand Ltd.' According to the First Witness Statement of Mr. Aryev, under Kyrgyz law only

Kyrgyz companies may hold licenses and assets, and conduct business in the Kyrgyz Republic. !'°

Alamudun, Alabuga,'!'' Baetov and Koshdube.'”? In late 2007, Stans Energy participated in the
tender for the Kara-Balty uranium processing facility held by the Kyrgyz State Property
Management Fund but its US$ 5 million bid was unsuccessful.'' In December 2008, Stans
Energy listed on the Toronto Stock Venture Exchange (“TSXV”) through a reverse takeover,

177. In June 2009, Stans Energy returned the Kapkatash and Shaltin properties to the Kyrgyz
State Geological Agency.''® In 2011, Stans Energy relinquished its rights to the Alabuga, Baetov
and Koshdube properties.''’ Since then, Stans Energy has held only one uranium licence in the
Kyrgyz Republic, known as Kargysh, which was part of the original Kyzyluraan license and is

currently in the process of being relinquished. ''*

178. The Parties hold different views of Stans Energy’s investments in the uranium sector.
The Claimants state that their investments were initially promising but “a combination of falling
uranium prices and the 2008 global financial crisis impeded Stans’ prospects of raising the
financing needed to advance development.”''? The Respondent, on the other hand, observes that
the uranium properties were “loss-making” from the beginning, considering that “‘at the time the
Claimants decided to invest between 2006 and 2007, uranium mining in the Kyrgyz Republic was

not the most promising area of investment”.'?°

2. Acquisition of the Licenses for Kutessay II and Kalesay

179. Retreating from the uranium sector, Stans Energy was looking for another investment
target in the Kyrgyz Republic.'?! The Claimants aver that, being aware that the REEs prices were
increasing, and following advice from Dr. Savchenko, Former Deputy Director of the Geology
and Investment Department of the Kyrgyz State Agency for Geology and Mineral Reserves, Stans
began to review the potential for rare earth exploration of the Aktyuz Ore Field, where Kutessay

II rare earth deposit (“Kutessay II”) and Kalesay beryllium deposit (“Kalesay”) were located.'?

>>123

In contrast, the Respondent defines the Claimants’ activity as “speculative license grabbing’

and asserts that Stans Energy:

never constructed, developed or operated a mine in the Kyrgyz Republic or anywhere else in
the world. It has also received no revenue to date from exploration or development [...] if the
Claimants are awarded even a small fraction of this sum [of their damages request], this
arbitration will represent the only successful business venture in Stans Energy’s corporate

mine had produced 80% of the USSR’s REEs until 1992.7°

181. After the dissolution of the USSR, Kutessay II was abandoned for approximately 15
years.'?7 In 2006, the Kyrgyz Republic opened a public bidding process for the Kutessay II and
Kalesay deposits, and Central Asia Metals Group LLC (“CAMG”) won the tender with a bid of
approximately US$ 50,000.'* On 15 November 2006, the Kyrgyz Republic issued its licence to
CAMG.'”

182. On 30 December 2008, the Kyrgyz government issued Resolution No 736 On Measures
for Implementing Requirements of the Tax Code of the Kyrgyz Republic (amended by Resolution

Energy was “offered to acquire Kutessay II for US$432,000 as per Kyrgyz Law.”'*4

184. According to the meeting minutes of the Board of Directors of Stans Energy on 9
October 2009, the Board of Directors of Stans Energy resolved that it “desires to acquire Kutessay
II and approve raising of US$ 600,000”.'° According to the exhibits submitted by the Claimants,
on 15 October 2009, Stans Energy’s Chairman of the Board of Directors, Ambassador Rodney
Irwin, sent a letter to Minister Kurmanaliev stating that “we would like to ask you to consider
issuance to our subsidiary «Stans Energy Kg» licenses to develop Kutessay II and Kalesay
deposits without tender with the bonus payment in the abovementioned amount [of US$ 427,323
(392,220+35,103)].”'°° This amount of US$ 427,323 corresponded to the sum of the tariff rates
for Kutessay II (US$ 392,220) and Kalesay (US$ 35,103) stipulated in Resolution No. 736.'°7

Stans Energy eventually paid double this amount, as described below. 38

Government. The Respondent argues that Mr. Eliseev did not hold any post with the
Respondent. '” On the other hand, the Claimants deem the Respondent’s denial at the Hearing of

been that Mr. Eliseev was a “public official” in connection with bribery allegations.'** According
to the Claimants, the acts of the Development Fund as well as the statements made by Mr. Eliseev

are attributable to the Respondent. '45

187. The Claimants aver that Mr. Eliseev assured Mr. Aryev “that the procedure for issuing
the licenses was lawful and that Stans’ licenses would be secure”.'“° According to Mr. Aryev’s
First Witness Statement, Mr. Eliseev told them that the licenses would be issued through a “bullet-
proof” process and that no one would be able to challenge Stans Energy’s rights in the future.'*”
According to Mr. Aryev’s First Witness Statement, at another meeting, Mr. Eliseev informed him
that his team had figured out how to set up such a “bullet-proof” procedure for Stans Energy to
obtain the Licenses.'** According to the Respondent, on the other hand, “Stans Energy and several
corrupt members of the Bakiev regime concocted an ad-hoc, convoluted and illegal scheme which
they (quite remarkably) referred to as ‘bullet-proof’ scheme which was designed to ensure that

the Claimants obtained the Licenses without the required competitive tender”.

Mr. Aryev, and demanded double the tariff rates stipulated in Resolution No. 736.'°° The Minister
purportedly described that the additional payment would be used for the activities of the

195. While the Claimants allege that “the Development Fund and other State agencies
organised the process,”!” the Respondent argues that CASE is “a commercial entity unrelated to
the State,” and the seller was Vesatel, “a company incorporated in New Zealand and not owned
by the State.”!”? The Respondent contends that the Claimants knew that the seller was Vesatel
before the auction took place or, alternatively, “at the absolute latest before the transaction
completed on 19 January 2010.”'™ According to the Respondent, Vesatel was “readily
identifiable” in the basic transaction documents in the possession of the Claimants,'” and “it
defies credibility that a serious publicly-listed company would engage in this transaction without
knowing the identity of the actual seller and registered owner of the target company[.]”'”° In any
event, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants should have known the identity of the seller

pursuant to their duty to conduct due diligence.'””

196. On the other hand, the Claimants argue that they had no opportunity to discover the
identity of Kutisay Mining OJSC’s shareholder, Vesatel (NZ), until after the acquisition of the
company.!7* They allege that “[t]he corporate structures used by the Development Fund were
within its discretion, and Stans Energy sought and received an explanation from Mr Eliseev about
the Fund’s use of a New Zealand entity[.]”!” The Claimants also contend that their additional
due diligence conducted after the acquisition of the Licenses did not reveal any concern over the

legitimacy of the Licenses and its purchasing process.'*°

863,550).'*? This amount was approximately double the sum of the tariff rates for Kutessay II and
Kalesay stipulated in Resolution No. 736. Stans KG paid this amount to the CASE on the same
day.'** As a result, Stans Energy, through Stans KG, became a sole owner of Kutisay Mining

OSJC, which owned the Licenses and the License Agreements No. 1.

198. The Respondent alleges that Stans Energy obtained the Licenses in breach of Kyrgyz

law through a bribe. '**

199. The Respondent contends that Stans Energy violated the tender requirement of Article
16 of the Subsoil Law, by obtaining the Licenses through auction instead of tender.'*° According
to the Respondent, Stans Energy and corrupt members of the Bakiev regime agreed to establish
the “bullet-proof scheme” designed to ensure that Stans Energy obtained the Licenses without the
required tender process. '*? The Respondent emphasizes that this agreement is notably apparent
from (1) Stans Energy’s letter dated 15 October 2009 stating that “we would like to ask you to
consider issuance to our subsidiary «Stans Energy Kg» licenses to develop Kutessay II and
Kalesay deposits without tender with the bonus payment in the abovementioned amount”; and

(2) Mr. Eliseev’s statement during the meeting in November 2009 that Stans Energy’s Licenses

would be secured through a “bullet-proof scheme”. '**

200. On the contrary, the Claimants contend that “[t]here is no basis to read Stans Energy’s
letter as prompting impropriety[.]”'** Rather, the Claimants consider that through such letter “the

Kyrgyz authorities were put on notice that they should take all necessary steps to ensure legality.

201. The Respondent argues that Resolution No 725, through which Stans Energy obtained
the Licenses, was invalid because it circumvented the fundamental provisions of the Subsoil law
by replacing a tender with an auction.'®! The Respondent further contends that, even if the
Licenses had been issued through the alternative direct negotiations procedure, Stans Energy
would have failed to comply with the requirements of Section V.A(1)(b) of the Subsoil Law.'*?
The Claimants deny these allegations, claiming that at that time there were no tender
regulations. '°> The Claimants contend that they followed the Resolution No 725 procedure,

instead of the direct negotiations process.'*4

202. The Respondent also argues that Stans Energy paid a bribe to acquire the Licenses. °°
According to the Respondent, none of the KGS 37.62 million paid by Stans Energy at the auction
was transferred to the State budget.'°° The Respondent contends that the Development Fund
retained KGS 8.379 million, instead of half of the KGS 37.62 million as described by Mr. Aryev,
and transferred 28.31 million to Vesatel (NZ).'°’ In the Respondent’s view, this KGS 28.31
million constituted a bribe, and was laundered through several AUB accounts held by Vesatel
(NZ), Avatroniks LLP (UK), Ostencomm LLP (UK), Velcona Limited (UK), Wenden LLP (UK)
and Sorento Resources Ltd (UK).'** The Respondent argues that none of these companies appears

to have any genuine economic activity.!°°

203. The Respondent further alleges that the CASE auction was rigged.” According to the
Respondent, the Kyrgyz Civil Code provided strict requirements, the breach of which invalided

the auction results, namely: (1) 30-day advance notice; and (2) participation of more than one

only bidder.” In this regard, the Respondent argues that Gremar’s auction bond payment of KGS
1.9 million (approximately US$ 50,000) on 28 December 2009 was a fiction. In support of this
contention, inter alia, the Respondent submitted a Witness Statement of Mr. Dmitry Antonenko,
purported attorney in fact, ultimate beneficial owner and bank account signatory of Gremar, in
which Mr. Antonenko avers that he had no knowledge whatsoever of Gremar or AUB and that
his signatures on AUB’s bank account documents for Gremar are not his and had apparently been

205

forged.
204. The Respondent also contends that the KGS 19 million, deposited in Kutisay OJSC’s
account on 9 December 2009, was the product of financial fraud and money laundering through
a series of suspicious transactions among offshore companies using their AUB accounts.” In the
Respondent’s view, this is supported by the fact that the amount was deposited in cash by
Mr. Khalil Akylbekov, instead of being paid either by Vesatel (NZ), Kutisay Mining OJSC’s

shareholder, or by the Development Fund, which was intended to control Kutisay Mining
OJSC.27

205. Furthermore, according to the Respondent, the Claimants knew or should have known
that they acquired the Licenses in breach of Kyrgyz law through corruption.”"* The Respondent
argues that the Kyrgyz Republic was recognized as one of the most corrupt countries.” The
Respondent also claims that it was publicly known that the Subsoil Law laid out a tender
requirement and that the Licenses were indeed first issued to CAMG through a tender
procedure. *!° According to the Respondent, the Claimants’ participation in corruption is
corroborated by the fact that Stans Energy knowingly paid double the sum of the tariff rates for

Kutessay II and Kalesay stipulated in Resolution No. 736; and the Claimants were aware of the

Kurmanaliev’s explanation that an additional payment was necessary for the Development Fund
to finance its projects, because the recipient was an official agency and the stated purposes were

investigate the legality of the Licenses or cancel them; such power resided within the GPO and
the courts, respectively, and was exercised in due course.”* The Respondent also rejects the
Claimants’ assertion that it did not raise the illegality of the Licenses until after a notice of

217. The Respondent contends that this purported “mine development plan”, which it
translates as “project”, was a technical plan required by the Subsoil Law,” and avers that the

refer to some other “mine development plan” is unsustainable, relying on the Expert Witness
Statement of Mr. Shilov, a Kyrgyz mining expert.° The Respondent adds that all the license
agreements issued by the SAGMR in 2010 and 2011, including the Licenses at issue, contained
the requirement to submit a technical project or technical plan.”4” That requirement was accepted
by the Claimants, as evidenced by contemporaneous statements.”“* The Respondent describes the
Claimants’ position as an attempt to escape the conclusion that their Licenses were subject to
termination due to their failure to provide the “technical plan” pursuant to Article 18 of the Subsoil

Law.*”

218. The Claimants, on the other hand, allege in their submissions that this “mine
development plan” was different from such a technical plan.*° According to the Claimants, a
failure to submit a “mine development plan” could not have resulted in termination of the Licenses

pursuant to Article 18 of the Subsoil Law.?*! In contrast, the Respondent notes that Mr. Aryev

any complaint by the regulatory authorities at the time about how the projects were being

handled”.**

226. The Claimants also argue that they never had the opportunity to challenge such
allegations at the time nor to invoke Article 356(1) of the Kyrgyz Civil Code:

which excuses Li with a 1 obi where the t hing party can

show that he or she took “all necessary measures for proper performance of the obligation
with the degree of care and prudence required by the nature of the obligation and by the
conditions of the transaction{.]”2”

The Respondent denies that Article 356(1) of the Civil Code could have been invoked. According
to the Respondent, the Civil Code “does not apply to subsoil licensing, including license
agreements granted under the Subsoil Law.” Rather, the termination of a subsoil license is

regulated only by the Subsoil Law.’”°

227. In any event, the Claimants argue that the alleged breaches were “ratified” when the
Kyrgyz government granted the new License Agreements No. 2.7”! The Respondent, on the other
hand, asserts that “it is not the function or the role of SAGMR or the Government at large to

‘complain’ about the licensee’s breaches. When a licensee fails to submit the required documents,

 

SAGMR is entitled to terminate the license. There is no requirement to ‘complain’””.

228. First, the Respondent points out that the License fee was paid two months late in three
tranches.” In response, the Claimants observe that the delay was because Stans Energy had to
comply with a number of formal requirements to gain control over Kutisay Mining OJSC’s
account and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic did not accept their initial attempt to make
a full payment of the license fee.’” The Respondent considers that the reasons alleged for the

delay are not sufficiently explained and are unsupported by evidence.?”* The Claimants continue

Republic had accepted the late payments.””°

229. Second, the Respondent points out that Kutisay Mining OJSC failed to submit the
technical plan, expert reports, and land allotment.?” In response, the Claimants contend, as
described above, that the License Agreements No. | did not require a technical plan but a
development plan, and that a failure to submit such a development plan could not have resulted

in termination of the License.?”*

230. The Claimants further contend that the Minister of Natural Resources assured them that
the one-year timeline for the license agreement’s requirements would not be enforced as long as
they would submit a report before the end of the year requesting more time.?”” The Respondent
disputes the existence of such assurances, considering that it is implausible that assurances
contrary to the express terms of the License Agreements were made and noting that, despite the
Tribunal’s order for document production, the Claimants have failed to produce any document
relating to them. 7° Moreover, the Respondent points out that Mr. Aryev testified at the Hearing
that he was never assured by the Minister that the period for compliance with License Agreements
No. | would be extended if the Claimants asked for more time.?*! According to the Respondent,
he also admitted that the Claimants did not place any reliance on alleged assurances in respect of

235. The Parties interpret provision 1.1 of License Agreement No. 2 differently. The

Respondent alleges that it requires the submission of a technical plan pursuant to the Subsoil Law.
The Respondent asserts that such a technical plan should have contained two parts: (1) technical
plan for the mine; and (2) technical plan for the plant, tailing facility and infrastructure. On the

other hand, the Claimants contend that they were required to provide two separate documents: (1)

substantive investment for renovation.
240. On 20 January 2011, the Ministry of Natural Resources issued an order that temporarily
suspended access to the State’s geological data for the following six months pending the
introduction of new funding mechanisms.*** Nevertheless, the Respondent points out that Stans
KG successfully requested permission for transfer of library materials on 16 February 2010, and
received them on 3 March 2010.*° Moreover, the Respondent argues that, by letter dated 15
October 2010, Stans KG requested a six-month extension to use the data, which was granted on

from Kazakhstan Mineral Company on Kutessay II, which provided similar results to the Soviet
data and outlined a US$ 9.3 million recommended work program.*** In April 2011, Stans Energy
received another report from Ms. Natalia Malyukova on the distribution of individual rare earth

242. In the same month, according to the Claimants, Stans Energy raised C$ 28 million via
a private placement. With this money, Stans Energy closed the US$ 5.5 million acquisition of
KCMP plant and the railway terminal at Kashka.*"' Stans Energy renamed the KCMP plant as
Kashka REE Plant (“KRP”).*!” The Claimants aver that these facilities were fundamental for their
production plan especially because “the railroad ensured that supplies (including chemicals and

explosives) necessary to extract rare metals and oxides could be shipped to the site”.*!

247. On 12 December 2011, Kutisay Mining LLC sent letters to the Ministry of Natural
Resources, requesting the extensions of the License Agreements No. 2 or the conclusion of new
License Agreements No. 3 until 31 December 2012.**4 The Respondent denies that this letter was
the start of negotiations regarding the conclusion of a third license agreement and notes that it
was a request for another extension of the term to comply with License Agreements No. 2. °° In
the abovementioned letter, Kutisay Mining LLC alleged that its delay to satisfy the conditions of
the License Agreements was due to inter alia (1) the “run-down state” of the related
infrastructures; (2) the different ownerships of these infrastructures; (3) “the significant time lost
in relation to the events of April 2010”; and (4) “the half-year restriction by the Kyrgyz Republic

Phase I Works at the Kalesay Deposit”.** In this letter, Kutisay Mining LLC described that it
planned to carry out its design works in two stages: (1) a design of regeneration of the existing
mill with 300,000 tons per year capacity at the first stage (end of 2011 — beginning of 2012); and
(2) a design of a new mill with the one million tons per year capacity at the second stage (before

the end of 2012).*” The enclosed Plan corresponded to the first stage.**°

249. The Parties disagree on whether Kutisay Mining LLC complied with the requirements

of the License Agreements No. 2.°7!

250. The Respondent contends that Kutisay Mining failed to submit a technical plan and the

expert reports.*? According to the R dent, the “draft technological scheme for rehabilitation

of the enrichment plant” enclosed in the 12 December 2011 letter was not qualified as a technical
plan because it “was a tiny portion of what needed to be included in the required TP”.*** Also, the
“Production Complex Plan for the Kutessay II Deposit with Phase I Works at the Kalesay
Deposit” enclosed in the 30 December 2011 letter was insufficient as a technical plan, because it
only covered the operation of 300,000 tons per year despite that Kutisay Mining LLC envisaged
the processing capability of one million tons per year, and because it failed to cover the mine

itself.*4

251. In response, the Claimants allege that the Respondent’s position that the Claimants
breached the License Agreements is contradicted by the sworn testimony of Mr. Ryskulov. **°
According to the Claimants, the License Agreement No. 2 did not require a technical plan but a
mine development plan.**° The Claimants contend that the Plan enclosed in the 30 December
letter was sufficient as a mine development plan, alleging that nothing in the License Agreements

No. 2 required a mine development plan for any particular processing capacity and that the Plan

regard the Respondent maintains the same position as concerning License Agreement No. | and
asserts that Claimants had to submit a technical plan and points to contemporaneous evidence

which would confirm that Claimants were aware about this requirement.***

252. The Claimants further contend that, with regard to Kutessay II, the Respondent ratified
the Claimants’ work by entering into a third license agreement.**? The Respondent strongly
opposes this argument, asserting that Kutessay License Agreement’s No. 3 was granted

unlawfully and the SAGMR’s employees involved were investigated and criminally convicted.”

253. The Claimants assert that their delay to comply with the deadlines was caused by factors
beyond their control, as described in their letter dated 12 December 2011.*"' In response, the
Respondent alleges that none of these factors could have justified the Claimants’ failure to provide

the required submissions, claiming that they did not substantively affect the Claimants’ work.*

254. The Claimants allege that non-compliance with the license agreement conditions was
not cited amongst the reasons for termination of the project at the relevant time and argue that
only after these arbitral proceedings started did the Respondent contend that the Claimants were
in “chronic breach” of the License Agreements terms.*“? The Claimants consider that these are
allegations constructed post hoc solely to justify the Respondent’s actions in the context of this

255. The Claimants also contend that Kyrgyz law would not have permitted such termination
without first granting the Claimants the opportunity to argue that any failure to perform might be
excused pursuant to Article 356(1) of the Civil Code.** As noted above, the Respondent denies
that Article 356(1) of the Civil Code could have been invoked because, according to the

Respondent, the Civil Code does not apply to subsoil licensing.

with the State if it wished to continue its Kutessay II work.**? The Respondent, on the other hand,

claims that Stans Energy voluntarily made such a proposal.**?

260. While it had not entered into new license agreements, Stans Energy continued to prepare
for mining operation.*** On 9 February 2012, Stans Energy reported that it had discovered a new
mining zone at Kutessay II.*** On 17 February 2012, Stans Energy appointed the Russian
Research Institute of Chemical Technology (“WNITHT”), a division of the State Atomic Energy

Corporation of Russia, as the lead engineering firm for the design build process at Kutessay II.*°°

261. On 15 February 2012, the Prime Minister changed the boundaries of Chon Kemin State
Natural National Park (“National Park”) by issuing Resolution No 93 to repeal Kyrgyz Republic
Government Resolution No 374 issued on 13 June 2009 “On changing the Boundaries of Chon
Kemin State National Park” (“Decree No 93”).**’ According to the Decree No 93, it adopted
“Tflor the purposes of preserving the unique natural habitats, biological and landscape variety,
and to preserve species of flora and fauna which are entered in the Red Book of the Kyrgyz
Republic”. *** According to the Claimants, the new territory of the National Park covered
substantial portions of Stans Energy’s open-pit infrastructures for Kutessay II.**? As a result, the

Claimants assert that the open-pit mining plan became impossible to implement.*°

No 93 so that the licensed areas would be excluded from the National Park.**' On 24 May 2012,
the SAGMR informed the Claimants that the Inter-District Court of Bishkek had declared the
Decree No 93 invalid; that court decision was being examined by the Appellate Instance of the
Bishkek City Court.* On 9 July 2012, SAGMR sent another letter informing that an inter-agency
working group would be set up to resolve the issues regarding the mining deposits and the natural

habitat protection.*

263. According to the Claimants, after consulting with Kyrgyz and Canadian experts, Stans
Energy amended its mining plan to introduce two-phase mining: (1) open-pit mining of 300,000
tons per year outside the boundaries of the National Park at Phase I; and (2) underground mining
of one million tons per year at Phase II.*° This new plan, however, required Stans Energy to

design a new mining complex.***

264. The Respondent explains that the change in the National Park boundaries was declared
invalid and reversed by the Respondent’s courts on 4 April 2012. The Respondent alleges that
this became known to Kutisay Mining LLC on 24 May 2012 at the latest so that “the short-lived
change in national park boundaries (during the 1.5 month period from 15 February 2012 to 4 April
2012, when Kutisay Mining LLC did not even have a valid license agreement in place) had no
effect on the Claimants”.**° The Respondent further argues that even Mr. Aryev admits that the
reasons for Kutisay Mining LLC changing its plans from open pit mining to combined open pit

and underground mining “was completely unrelated to the temporary change in the national park

boundaries or any other State actions”.*°”

265. On 29 March 2012, Kutisay Mining LLC requested the SAGMR to enter into revised

Kutessay II and Kalesay License Agreements No. 3 reflecting the change of mining plan.**

266. On 14 April 2012, Mr. Aryev met with Mr. Tashbayev to discuss the conclusion of
License Agreements No. 3 for Kutessay II and Kalesay.*® According to Kutisay Mining LLC’s
letter of 17 April 2012, Mr. Tashbayev “offered to consider creating a public-private partnership
by way of transfer of part of the share capital of Kutisay Mining LLC to the Kyrgyz Republic and
to submit new drafts of License Agreements No 3.”*” On this letter, Kutisay Mining LLC

enclosed a revised draft License Agreement No. 3 for Kutessay II.*7!

Agreement No. 3 for Kutessay II (“Kutessay II License Agreement No. 3”), valid until 31

performance, the granting of this license agreement was illegal and the SAGMR officials involved

were later prosecuted.*”

278. Mr. Jiangang continued that “[a]t present, we have attend versteigern about licence
(maybe only your company and mine). If we can have cooperation before this versteigern, it can
reduce cost and get benefit for us.”**' [sic] In this regard, the Claimants observe that, because
“versteigern” is a German term referring to auction, Mr. Jiangang appeared to suggest that an
auction for Kutessay II License was expected to be held despite the fact that Kutisay Mining LLC
held the same License valid until 2029.*°? The Respondent, however, points out that Mr. Jiangang

did not refer to any specific mine.*”°

279. In May 2012, Stans Energy’s Kyrgyz management and local representatives of Baotou
had an introductory meeting in Kyrgyzstan.*°* A further meeting between the top level
management was arranged.*** In e-mail exchanges arranging the meeting, Mr. Jiangang stated
that Baotou “have contacted with [KCMP (the previous owner of KRP)] many times and reached

that Stans Energy had owned KRP since 2011.*”’ The Respondent, however, points out that the
e-mail is unclear and that Baotou could have entered into such an agreement with KCMP prior to

Stans Energy’s acquisition of KRP.**

285. By press release of 30 July 2012, Stans Energy announced that it had initiated legal
action.*°* According to the exhibits submitted by the Claimants, the market reacted to this release
and Stans Energy’s market capitalization dropped from US$ 76.8 million (30 July) to 65.9 million
(31 July).

286. The Claimants contend that Baotou appeared to have affiliates within the Kyrgyz
government that backed up Baotou’s take-over of the Kutessay II project.*!° In this regard, the
Claimants submit that there was a personal relationship between Deputy Badykeeva and Baotou:
Ms. Badykeeva’s family had owned or controlled a significant share in CAMG, in which Baotou
had purchased a stake in 2008.*!' The Respondent denies such a potential conspiracy, alleging
that Baotou was a private foreign party unrelated to the Kyrgyz government and that Baotou’s
approach to Stans Energy was nothing more than an offer of cooperation or joint-venture.*!? The
Respondent also adds that the SAGMR, a governmental authority, supported Kutisay Mining LLC

in the court proceedings in which Baotou sought invalidation of Stans Energy’s Licenses.*"*

287. The Respondent contends that the 26 June 2012 Resolution was not implemented and
is irrelevant to the ultimate termination of the Licenses.‘"* In support of this contention, the
Respondent argues that the Resolution was not binding, the SAGMR actually did not follow it,
and the Resolution was ultimately invalidated by Kyrgyz courts.*'* In response, the Claimants
contend that these facts do not undermine the importance of the Resolution, alleging that it

significantly impacted on Stans Energy’s market capitalization.*!

2. Thirty-days’ Work Suspension Order of the Kutessay II License Agreement No. 3

288. As described above, the Kutessay II License Agreement No. 3 required Stans KG to
enter into a preliminary and main agreements with the Kyrgyz Republic regarding the transfer of

shares in Kutisay Mining LLC to the State Property Management Fund."!”

289. In this regard, on 16 July 2012, two weeks before the deadline set out in Clause 2.1 of
Kutessay II License Agreement No. 3, Stans Energy sent the SAGMR a draft preliminary
agreement.‘'* The Claimants assert that they obtained no response, so Stans Energy wrote follow-
up letters to SAGMR on 27 July 2012, and to the State Property Management Fund on 31 July
2012, without receiving any response either.*'” The Respondent, on the other hand, avers that the
SAGMR was not the appropriate counterparty to receive such letters as “SAGMR did not have
the authority to enter into any such agreement — only the State Property Management Fund did”.”°
The Respondent notes that the Claimants submitted their draft to the State Property Management
Fund only on 31 July 2012, the deadline date, in order to leave the Fund with insufficient time to
review and approve it, especially because its general practice was to provide an answer within 30
calendar days of any request.*7!

290. On 29 August 2012, Stans Energy wrote to the State Property Management Fund
attaching a sealed and stamped version of the preliminary agreement, and noting that there was
little time remaining until 30 September, the deadline for the main agreement on the share transfer

to the Fund.*?

291. On 30 August 2012, the Subsoil Use Licensing Commission of the SAGMR decided on
a suspension and subsequent stop-work order concerning the Kutessay II License Agreement

Management Fund by 31 July 2012. **

292. On 10 September 2012, Kutisay Mining LLC filed a Statement of Claim against the
SAGMR (the defendant) and the State Property Management Fund (a third party) before the
Bishkek Inter-District Court, requesting a declaration that the Commission’s meeting minutes of

Minister D. K. Otorbayev requesting to resolve this matter.*”°

294. On 24 September 2012, Stans KG wrote the State Property Management Fund,
emphasizing that the Fund had not responded to Stans KG’s proposal for the preliminary

agreement, and proposing to have negotiations in this regard.*””

295. On 28 September 2012, the SAGMR replied to Stans KG’s letter of 24 September 2012,
noting that the Fund had not received any letter from Stans KG but Kutisay Mining LLC before
24 September 2012, and informing that the Fund suspended its consideration of entering into the
preliminary agreement until the Bishkek Inter-District Court delivered its decision regarding the

validity of the suspension order.*”*

297. On 8 October 2012, the Inter-District Court of Bishkek ruled in favour of Kutisay
Mining LLC, invalidating the Parliamentary Committee’s Resolution of 26 June 2012.*° The

Court reasoned that the power to allocate subsoil rights was vested to the Government, instead of

the Parliament.**!

298. On 16 October 2012, the Inter-District Court of Bishkek ruled in Kutisay Mining LLC’s

favour, invalidating the work suspension order.**? According to the Court, Kutisay Mining “took

all of the steps within its power in order to conclude the preliminary agreement with the Fund.”

299. On 16 October 2012, the State Property Management Fund wrote a letter to the
SAGMR.*™ In this letter, the Fund advised the SAGMR that it would not decide to conclude the

preliminary and main agreements before obtaining opinions from other governmental entities.**

of the requirement set forth by Article 16 of the Subsoil Law that they be granted through a

tender.***

301. On 14 January 2013, Kutisay Mining LLC sent to the SAGMR an environmental report
titled “the Environmental Safety section of ‘Open Pit — Existing Mill’ Haul Road Repair Project

for Kutessay II” concerning its intended repairs for the road to the pit from the old Aktyuz mill.“

302. On 30 January 2013, Kutisay Mining LLC sent a letter to the SAGMR enclosing an
Information Report describing its work in 2012.” In the same letter, Kutisay Mining LLC also

enclosed its 2013 Work Program, which required approval by the SAGMR.**!

303. The Claimants contend that, not having received a response to these letters, concerns
about their ability to still fulfil the deadlines set forth in License Agreement No. 3 led Kutisay
Mining LLC to request, on 12 February 2013, that the SAGMR consider an addendum to Kutessay
II License Agreement No. 3 extending the deadlines for certain tasks.“ In this letter, Kutisay

Mining LLC argued that, due to the one-month suspension order:

we and our contractors were forced to stop all preparatory and design works on Kutessay II
[...] we were forced to abandon a project that provided for the use of an old mill plant and
tailings pond in Aktyuz, because [...] long-lasting legal proceedings between previous
owners have led to the loss of the opportunity to purchase the mill plant.“

304. On 19 February 2013, the SAGMR refused to approve the 2013 Work Program,
reasoning that Kutisay Mining LLC had not provided an expert-approved design documents
required under the Subsoil Law.“ On 28 February 2013, Kutisay Mining LLC requested the
approval of the 2013 Work Program, informing that it would provide the expert opinions by

argues that “[T]he Environmental Safety section of ‘Open Pit — Existing Mill’ Haul Road Repair
Project for Kutessay II” submitted on 14 January 2013 was not an expert report but a part of
technical plan.*°> The Respondent notes that the Claimants blame the 30-day suspension imposed
on 30 August 2012 for their delays in complying with Kutessay II License Agreement No. 3.*°°
Nevertheless, the Respondent points out that such suspension only affected the Claimants’ work
for one month, that Claimants have failed to specify which works they were unable to complete
due to the suspension and further contends that the suspension “did not and could not have a
material or any impact on the project deliverables that Kutisay was required to achieve under the
terms of Kutessay LA 3”.‘°’ Thus, the SAGMR did not agree to extend the deadlines of the
Kutessay II License Agreement No. 3 because it considered that Kutisay Mining LLC had not

shown justifiable reasons for its delay.*°*

308. The Claimants, in response, argue that Kutisay Mining LLC’s failure to comply with
the requirements was due to the SAGMR’s disengagement with the Claimants.**° The Claimants
assert that”[t]he Environmental Safety section of ‘Open Pit — Existing Mill’ Haul Road Repair
Project for Kutessay II” submitted on 14 January 2013 was an independent expert report, and that
in any event this report was unrelated to the deliverables under Kutessay II License Agreement
No. 3.‘ The Claimants further allege that the SAGMR refused to agree on the extension of the
deadlines under the Agreement despite the fact that the Kyrgyz government had created the
obstacles for the Claimants’ work.**! Moreover, the Claimants argue that the Respondent’s
mining expert, Mr. Shilov, “firmly rejected the contention that the Claimants’ interactions with
SAGMR had been unnecessary[.]’? Rather, his view was that such exchanges were necessary
as the Subsoil Law only provided general concepts.’ According to the Claimants, Mr. Shilov’s
opinion was that “the Claimants had acted precisely as he advises his own clients to do in

circumstances where ‘something [is] forced upon [them]’ by SAGMR.”"44

ASIARUD REPORTS AND STANS ENERGY’S DISCLOSURE

309. On 21 December 2012, approximately three months after the expiration of the
suspension order, AsiaRud, which Kutisay Mining had commissioned to complete a technical and
economic assessment required under Clause 3.3(1) of the Kutessay II Licence Agreement No. 3,
sent a letter to Kutisay Mining LLC.*® In this letter, AsiaRud concluded that it “considers that
there is no point at present time to work on the [TEA] of conditions and of the project of the
underground mine”,** describing that “the current price of REE (as at November 2012) and the
calculated amount of REE in the concentrate is significantly lower than the critical amount which
points out that the development of REE deposit Kutessay II at the current price is already loss-
making and the reserves are off-balance”. 4”

310. On 10 January 2013, Kutisay Mining LLC instructed AsiaRud to employ the price of
US$ 128.75/kg for the feasibility calculations in its TEA.“°*

311. By letter of 4 April 2013, AsiaRud informed Kutisay Mining LLC that it had concluded
that “due to no-provision of the information, required for the development of the Feasibility
conditions [...] and receipt of negative economic effectiveness arrival, based on preliminary

calculations, at a negative economic efficiency [...] for the work on the conditions for Feasibility

should be deemed to be pointless”.*”

312. In its letter dated 24 April 2013, Kutisay Mining LLC notified that it had accepted the
then-current concentrate price of US$ 18.45/kg for the feasibility calculation.*” In the same letter,
Kutisay Mining LLC asked AsiaRud to indicate the concentrate price at which the project would
be profitable with an IRR of 12%.47!

313. In July 2013, AsiaRud issued a report (“AsiaRud 2013 Report”).‘” In this Report,
AsiaRud described that “[a]t present time, the REE concentrate price at the processing plant and
in the market of rare earth does not allow to implement profitable development of Kutessay II.
Because of this, at [Kutisay’s] instructions all project solutions were developed for the version
with the assumed price for REE concentrate of 74$/kg which provides for the floor of profitability
of the project at 12% IRR.”4 AsiaRud also mentioned in the Report that “[t]he calculated

reserves in this report are referred to as ‘balance’ [reserves] conditionally because they are not in

line with the real economics of the project due to a lower price for them at present time”.4”*

314. In this regard, the Respondent alleges that Stans Energy failed to disclose the AsiaRud
2013 Report in breach of Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) Rules (“TSX Rules”).”° According
to the Respondent, this Report constituted “Material Information” which should be timely

disclosed pursuant to the TSX Rules.*”° The Respondent continues that Stans Energy also failed

to timely-disclose other “Material Information”.‘””

315. The Claimants, in response, allege that Stans Energy complied with the TSX Rules.*”
The Claimants emphasize that Stans Energy’s decisions to disclose or not to disclose information
were fully in compliance with Ontario Securities Act and the National Instrument 43-101 on
Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”), under which the AsiaRud Reports
were not required to be disclosed as a report prepared by a “qualified person”. The Claimants

also contend that their decisions on disclosure were made in accordance with expert legal advice,

JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS REGARDING THE VALIDITY OF THE GRANTING OF THE LICENSES

316. After the measures described above, several judicial proceedings took place before the
Respondent’s national courts concerning the validity of the process through which the Licenses
had been granted to the Claimants. These judicial proceedings, the relevance of which is disputed

between the Parties, are described in the following paragraphs.

1. Proceedings Brought by the Prosecutor General Before the Inter-District Court of
Bishkek Asking to Invalidate the 21 December Minutes (No 736-N-09)

317. After concluding that the issuance of the Licenses without tender had been illegal
through its January 2013 inspection, on 4 April 2013, the GPO filed its Statement of Claim against
the SAGMR (defendant) and Kutisay Mining OJSC (third party) before the Inter-District Court
of Bishkek, requesting that the Court invalidate the 21 December 2009 Minutes (the “GPO
Claim”).‘*! The GPO claimed that the 21 December 2009 Minutes should be declared invalid
because, inter alia, (1) Resolution No 725 contradicted Article 16 of the Subsoil Law, and Article
32 of the Law on Normative Acts provides that in case of conflict between normative legal acts,
entities shall be guided by the normative act with the highest rank in the hierarchy of norms; and
(2) Resolution No 725 was not in force when the Licenses were granted to Kutisay because it had

not yet been officially published.**”

318. On 9 April 2013, the Council of the Coalition of the Parliamentary Majority

recommended that the Kyrgyz Republic cancel the Licenses and that the GPO “take measures to

319. On 15 April 2013, the Inter-District Court of Bishkek granted the GPO’s request for an
injunction prohibiting anyone, including Kutisay Mining LLC and the SAGMR, from taking any

action with respect to the Licenses.‘

320. In response, Kutisay Mining, along with the Aktyuz town council appealed the Court’s
order of 15 April 2013.*° On 29 May 2013, the Court declined the appeal arguing that revoking
the interim measures may complicate the execution of the Court’s decision on the merits.**° The
Claimants contend that, since then, they have not conducted any work at Kutessay II and

[...] the judicial panel has reached a conclusion that the decisions of the trial court and the
appellate court invalidating Minutes No 1736-N-09 of direct negotiations between the State
Agency of Geology and Mineral Resources of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and
Kutisay Mining OJSC dated 21 December 2009 were well founded.

[nl

The judicial panel agrees with court findings that the Kyrgyz Republic Government
Resolution [No. 725] was not in force as of the date of license issue as it was officially
published in Erkin-Too newspaper only on 25 December 2009. Pursuant to Article 30 of the
Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Regulatory Legal Acts of the Kyrgyz Republic”, the official
publication of regulatory legal acts is a mandatory condition for acts to come into force.
Pursuant to Part 3 Article 30 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Regulatory Legal Acts
of the Kyrgyz Republic”, regulatory legal acts shall come into force 15 days after the official
publication, unless otherwise provided by the relevant act itself. Kyrgyz Republic
Government Resolution No 725 dated 1 December 2009 does not provide for specific
effective date and, therefore, pursuant to the above-mentioned Law, the Resolution came into
force on 9 January 2010, i.e. the license was issued 19 days before the effective date of
Kyrgyz Republic Government Resolution No 725 dated 1 December 2009.

[nl

Based on above, the judicial panel of the supervisory instance is of opinion that courts
reasonably reached a conclusion that the State Agency of Geology and Mineral Resources of
the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic had violated the law in force in the Kyrgyz Republic
by issuing licenses Nos. 2488ME and 2489ME for Kutessay and Kalesay, respectively,
through direct negotiations, as indicated in the Minutes No. 1736-H-09 dated 21 December
2009 [...}°

323. While the Claimants argue that the Respondent’s courts considered “the SAGMR’s
acceptance of the claim dispositive as a matter of Kyrgyz civil procedure and effectively ignored
Kutisay Mining’s rights in a clear breach of due process”;** the Respondent contends that its
courts “did not merely dismiss the claims by treating SAGMR’s acceptance of the claim as

dispositive [but] considered the merits of the claims in detail”.‘**

2. Proceedings Brought by Baotou Before the Bishkek City Court Asking to Invalidate
the SAGMR’s 2009 Decisions

324. In January 2013, Baotou purchased the remaining shares in, and became the sole owner
of, CAMG.“°5
325. Baotou then filed its claim against the SAGMR before the Inter-District Court of

Bishkek, requesting the Court to invalidate SAGMR’s 2009 decisions (1) to terminate CAMG’s
licenses to Kutessay II and Kalesay; and (2) to award these Licenses to Kutisay Mining OJSC.*°

326. On 11 June 2013, the Inter-District Court of Bishkek decided in favour of Baotou,
invalidating the 2009 decisions, and ordering the SAGMR to reinstate Baotou’s supposed
rights.*°”

327. On 29 August 2013, however, the Bishkek City Court overturned the Inter-District
Court’s decision, holding that (1) Baotou did not have standing because the license holder was
CAMG instead of Baotou; (2) the claim was time-barred; and (3) CAMG had failed to comply

with its license agreements. ***

THE CLAIMANTS’ ARBITRATION BEFORE THE MCCI

328. On 30 October 2013, Stans Energy and Kutisay Mining LLC filed their Statement of
Claim in an international arbitration before the Moscow Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(“MCCT’) against the Kyrgyz Republic (“MCCI Arbitration”), pursuant to the Moscow
Convention.”

II project would not be profitable.” In contrast, the Claimants assert that the Respondent’s
version of their motivations is “distorted and unsupported by the evidence [...] makes no attempt
to prove the irrelevant allegation that the Claimants were reckless and interested only in a quick

exit” 0!

330. In April 2014, the tribunal in the MCCI Arbitration issued an award ordering the Kyrgyz
Republic to pay in excess of US$ 118 million.*

331. The Respondent criticizes the Claimants’ choice of MCCI Arbitration, asserting that
such system “has long been heavily criticised: the practice of setting up arbitral institutions to
serve the interests of Russian industrial groups (known as ‘pocket arbitrations’) was endemic”.*°
The Respondent points out that Ms. Kuranova, former CFO of Stans Energy, explains “that the
valuation report filed in the MCCI Arbitration [...] materially overstated prices for REEs and thus
materially overstated the value of the Kutessay II project”.* The Respondent also notes with
concern that the daughter of one of the arbitrators in the MCCI Arbitration was a partner in the

law firm of one of the Claimants’ representatives.*°

332. The Claimants argue that the allegations put forward by Ms. Kuranova in an unrelated
litigation were never established in a court of law (as the parties reached a confidential
settlement), are an impermissible attempt to adduce facts through untested argument from an

unrelated case and are, in any event, untrue.*”°

333. On 25 May 2015, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court set aside the MCCI award, accepting
the Kyrgyz Republic’s argument that the tribunal in the MCCI Arbitration had no jurisdiction

FORMAL TERMINATION OF THE LICENSES BY THE SAGMR

334. On 17 October 2014, the SAGMR’s Subsoil Use Licensing Commission decided to
terminate Kutisay Mining LLC’s Licenses, referring to the decisions of the Kyrgyz courts in
favour of the GPO.*” According to the extract of the minutes provided by the Claimants (“17
October 2014 Minutes”), the SAGMR decided as follows:

Having exchanged opinions, the Committee DECIDES:

To take note of the decision of the Inter-District Court of Bishkek dated 14 March
2014 that has entered into force and been upheld by the decision of the Bishkek City
Court dated 30 July 2014 and to deem the subsoil use rights under Licenses Nos 2488
ME and 2489 ME terminated pursuant to Article 27, Part 5, of the Kyrgyz Republic
Law “On Subsoil”, and to deliver to Kutisay Mining LLC a relevant notice of
termination of subsoil use rights under:

- Subsoil License No 2488 ME issued to Kutisay Mining LLC on 20 September 2010 for
a term until 21 December 2029 for the right of subsoil use at the Kutessay II deposit for the
purpose of development of rare earth elements, bismuth, molybdenum and silver. Decision
is carried unanimously. U.D. Ryskulov and K.K. Zhumabekov were absent.

= Subsoil License No 2489 ME issued on 20 September 2010 for a term until 21
December 2029 for the right of subsoil use at the Kalesay deposit for the purpose of
development of beryllium and lead. Decision is carried unanimously. U.D. Ryskulov and
K.K. Zhumabekov were absent.5"°

335. Kutisay Mining LLC filed a claim with the Inter-District Court of Bishkek seeking
invalidation of the 17 October 2014 Minutes.*'! On 8 December 2014, the Inter-District Court of

337. On 22 January 2016, the Kyrgyz Government announced a tender for the Kutessay II
and Kalesay deposits.*"* A repetition of the bidding process was announced in September 2017.*!°
The tender conditions provided for a minimum bidding price of US$ 10 million.*'* According to
the Claimants, such amount comprises a statutory fee and a bonus, as was the case with the
purchase by Kutisay Mining OJSC in December 2009.°!’ Furthermore, the Claimants contend
that the minimum bid was determined “on the basis of a valuation commissioned by the
government that reflected a project value of more than US$ 110 million — in stark contrast to the
Respondent’s assertion in these proceedings that the licenses were worth nothing.”*'* As evidence
of the above-mentioned valuation, the Claimants submitted a spreadsheet which, they consider,
reflects a post-tax valuation by the Respondent of the Kutessay II deposit in an amount of over
US$ 110 million.*'° In contrast, the Respondent argues that the said spreadsheet merely contains
two models with hypothetical assumptions, which do not amount to a valuation and which, in any
case, show a range of mostly negative NPVs.*”° The above-referenced tenders were unsuccessful.
The Respondent points out that the mining rights over the Kutessay II and Kalesay deposits

remain unallocated until the date of this arbitration.*”'

Law, an entity must be an “investor” which has made a “direct investment”.*** Stans Energy’s
indirect shareholding in Kutisay Mining LLC, however, is not a “direct investment”,*?> while
Kutisay Mining LLC is not a “foreign investor” nor an “investor” with a qualifying “direct

investment”.*”° Moreover, the Respondent argues that the Claimants’ claims must be dismissed

due to illegality.*?”

340. In addition, the Parties disagree as to the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the

2003 Investment Law.

MATERIAL SCOPE OF JURISDICTION UNDER THE 2003 INVESTMENT LAW

341. Specifically, the Respondent disputes that all of the legal bases or causes of action
invoked by the Claimants in the present arbitration fall within the jurisdiction of the present
Tribunal pursuant to Article 18 of the 2003 Investment Law. The Respondent also disputes the

relevance of international law in claims pursuant to Article 18.

1. Whether Article 3(1) of the 2003 Investment Law Limits the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction
to Claims Under the Substantive Provisions of the 2003 Investment Law

343. The Claimants argue that Article 18 of the 2003 Investment Law contains the
Respondent’s consent to submit to international arbitration all “investment disputes” with foreign
investors (as defined in Article 1(6) of the same instrument).**° That consent is not limited to
disputes based on the substantive provisions of the 2003 Investment Law. Therefore, the scope of
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction would encompass claims for breaches of the Moscow Convention and

general international law.

344. The Respondent argues that the material scope of jurisdiction of tribunals under the
2003 Investment Law is limited to breaches of the substantive provisions of that Law.
Accordingly, any claims that an investor may file must be strictly limited to breaches of the
provisions of the 2003 Investment Law. This jurisdictional objection is based on Article 3(1) of

the 2003 Investment Law, which provides:

Translation as provided by the Claimants in Law No 66 of 27 March 2003 on Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic, as

a. The Claimants’ Position

345. The Claimants disagree with the Respondent’s view that Article 3(1) of the 2003
Investment Law limits the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to breaches of the substantive provisions of the
2003 Investment Law. Rather, the Claimants assert that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is
circumscribed only by Article 18 of the 2003 Investment Law and that Article 3(1) is irrelevant

in this regard. +

346. Article 18 of the 2003 Investment Law contains the Respondent’s consent to submit to
international arbitration all “investment disputes” with foreign investors. The term “investment
dispute” is defined in Article 1(6) of the 2003 Investment Law, and none of these provisions are

limited to disputes based on the substantive provisions of the 2003 Investment Law.*™4

347. Article 18(2) of the 2003 Investment Law codifies the Respondent’s consent to
arbitration of “any dispute [...] arising in the process of investment” and does not make
distinctions as to the legal basis of the investor’s position.** In support of a broad definition of
the term “disputes”, the Claimants rely on the decision in Philip Morris v. Uruguay, where the
Tribunal concluded that “[t]he term “disputes” [...] is to be interpreted broadly as concerning the
subject matter and facts at issue and not as limited to particular legal claims, including specifically

BIT claims”.**° Likewise, the Tribunal in SGS v. Philippines considered that “[t]he term “disputes

348. They also deny the Respondent’s contention that the Claimants attempt to use an
applicable law clause to expand the Tribunal’s jurisdiction (an approach that, according to the
Respondent, had been rejected by the tribunals in the Eurotunnel Arbitration and the OSPAR
Convention arbitration).>* The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s reliance on the Eurotunnel
case is inappropriate because in that case the applicable Concession Agreement specifically
limited the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal to disputes relating to such agreement.*” Similarly,
the Claimants criticize the Respondent’s reference to the OSPAR Arbitration given that the
dispute resolution clause in the underlying treaty limited arbitration to “[a]ny disputes between
Contracting Parties relating to the interpretation or application of the Convention”;*° while no

comparable limitation is found in Article 18 of the 2003 Investment Law.

349. The Claimants contend that, pursuant to Article 18 of the 2003 Investment Law, the
scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction therefore includes claims for breaches of the Moscow

Convention and general international law. *!

351. In ascertaining the contents of the 2003 Investment Law, the Respondent contends that
the Tribunal must refer to Kyrgyz law principles of statutory interpretation.“ It argues that,
pursuant to those principles, there is no justification for interpreting the term “investment dispute”
broadly.** While the Respondent accepts that the Tribunal may have to incidentally consider
other Kyrgyz laws, like the Subsoil Law and the Law on Normative Legal Acts, which might
pertain to the relations between the Kyrgyz Republic and investors, such laws are outside the
scope of relationships regulated by the 2003 Investment Law “and cannot provide a basis for a
claim brought based on the offer to arbitrate in the 2003 Investment Law”. *°

352. On the contrary, pursuant to Article 18(2) of the 2003 Investment Law, an investor can
only commence international arbitration if it has made a “direct investment” and Article 3(1) of
the same law defines the scope of the relations in this field. According to the Respondent, the
claims that an investor may file are necessarily limited by the scope of those relations as defined
in Article 3(1) (“this Law and other normative legal acts of the Kyrgyz Republic enacted in
accordance with this Law”). *4° The Respondent notes that the Claimants mistakenly aver that
Article 2(1) of the 2003 Investment Law is an “applicable law” clause, and a basis for them to
bring claims based on international law. *” According to the Respondent, this interpretation
renders Article 3(1) devoid of meaning, as the only plausible interpretation for Article 3(1) is that

it defines the claims which may be brought under the 2003 Investment Law. **

353. The Respondent argues that international tribunals have recognised that there is a
“cardinal distinction” between the questions of jurisdiction and applicable law, which the
Claimants attempt to deliberately intertwine. * In this regard, the Respondent points out that
Article 3(1) of the 2003 Investment Law is very similar to the relevant clause in the Eurotunnel
Arbitration, where the Tribunal rejected the Claimants attempt to use the “applicable law” clause

to expand the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.**° Similarly, the tribunal in the OSPAR Convention

rejected an attempt by the claimant to use an applicable law clause to expand the jurisdiction of
an arbitral tribunal.**' Moreover, the Respondent alleges that consent to arbitration under Article
18(2) of the 2003 Investment Law is a unilateral declaration which, according to Article 8 of the
ILC Guiding Principles, entails obligations only if it is stated in clear and specific terms, and
which must be interpreted in a restrictive manner. *°? In this regard, the Respondent avers that the
definition of “investment dispute” in Article 1(6) cannot be interpreted as a “clear and specific”

undertaking to arbitrate disputes based on any normative source. *?

354. Finally, the Respondent submits that it would be unreasonable to conclude that the
Respondent had intended to offer an “unqualified jurisdictional regime” to investors by enacting
the 2003 Investment Law.** It notes that accepting the Claimants’ broad interpretation of that
clause would go against the restrictive interpretation predicable of unilateral declarations. **°
Furthermore, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ contention that by only establishing certain
substantive protections under the 2003 Investment Law, the State would be abrogating its
international obligations through national legislation. “° In this respect, the Respondent

underscores that:

[limiting the claims that an investor can bring to specific causes of action does not in any
way infringe this principle. A State may be under an obligation not to breach the customary
international standards on investment protection. However, a State is not under an obligation
to consent to arbitrate all investment disputes [...] Such a limited consent to jurisdiction is
perfectly consistent with international law. **7

January 2017 decided as follows:

a. The objections raised by the Respondent against the jurisdiction of the present

b. The question whether the Claimants qualify as “investors” holding
“investments” under the relevant Kyrgyz legislation will be considered in conjunction with
the merits of the case.

356. The Tribunal notes that, in this dispositif; the Tribunal accepted jurisdiction subject only
to the notions of “investors” and “investments”, which will be examined below in this Award, but

not to any limit to the substantive provisions of the 2003 Investment Law.***

357. Irrespective thereof, in the view of the Tribunal, the wording of Article 18 of the 2003

Investment Law is clear as it provides in the Respondent’s own translation:

Article 18

(1) An investment dispute shall be resolved in accordance with any applicable procedure
agreed in advance between the investor and the state agencies of the Kyrgyz Republic, which
shall not exclude the use by the investor of other legal remedies in accordance with the
legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic.

(2) In the absence of such an agreement, an investment dispute between authorized state
agencies of the Kyrgyz Republic and an investor shall be settled, if possible, through
consultations between the parties. If the parties do not reach an amicable settlement of the
dispute within three months from the day of the initial written request for such consultations,
any investment dispute between an investor and state agencies of the Kyrgyz Republic shall
be resolved in the judicial authorities of the Kyrgyz Republic, unless, in the case of a dispute
between a foreign investor and a state agency, one of the parties asks for the dispute to be
considered in accordance with one of the following procedures, by applying to:

 

(a) to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) based on
the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of
Other States or Rules Governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of
Proceedings by the Secretariat of the Centre: or

(b) to arbitration or an international ad hoc arbitral tribunal (commercial court) formed in
accordance with the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International
Trade Law.

(3) If an investment dispute is referred to arbitration in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of
paragraph 2 of this article, the Kyrgyz Republic shall waive the right to demand the prior
exhaustion of all internal administrative or judicial procedures before referring the dispute to
international arbitration.5"

358. And subparagraph (4) of Article 18 (of which only a translation by the Claimants has

been provided), provides:

4. Any investment dispute between foreign and domestic investors shall be considered
by the judicial bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic unless the parties agree on any other dispute

358 Pursuant to the procedural timetable set out in Procedural Order No. 6, it was nonetheless open to the Respondent to
“raise any remaining objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal” with its Statement of Defence on the Merits”.

settlement procedure, including national and international arbitration. 6

359. The Tribunal notes that, in the above provisions, the terms “an investment dispute” and
“any investment dispute” are used. Article 1(6) of the 2003 Investment Law provides the
following definition of the term: “Jnvestment dispute” means any dispute between an investor
and government bodies, officials of the Kyrgyz Republic and other participants of investment

activity, arising in the process of investment.**!

360. As the wording of neither of the above provisions in the 2003 Investment Law makes
the limitation suggested by the Respondent (by relying on Article 3(1) of the 2003 Investment
Law), and particularly the above definition in Article 1(6) refers to “Any dispute”, the Tribunal
sees no ground for restricting its jurisdiction to only disputes under the substantive provisions of
the 2003 Investment Law on the basis of its Article 3(1), but rather concludes that, indeed, any
investment dispute between the Parties is under its jurisdiction, subject to the further examination

of the Respondent’s other jurisdictional objections in the following sections.

2. ‘Whether International Treaties and General International Law Form Part of the
Applicable Law Pursuant to Article 2(1) of the 2003 Investment Law

361. The Parties are also in disagreement as to the law that the Tribunal shall apply in
resolving their dispute. The Claimants consider that international law should at least be relevant
to determine the content of the obligations assumed by the Respondent. The Respondent avers
that, in determining the content of the 2003 Investment Law, the Tribunal must refer to Kyrgyz

law principles of statutory interpretation.

362. The Parties’ discussions regarding the applicable law in the present arbitration centre

on Article 2 of the 2003 Investment Law, which provides:

366. The Claimants rely on the decision in the Wena Hotels v. Egypt annulment proceedings

where a similar constitutional provision, according to the ad hoc Committee:

42. [...] amount[ed] to a kind of renvoi to international law by the very law of the host state
[nl

44. [...] when a tribunal applies the law embodied in a treaty to which Egypt is a party it is
not applying rules alien to the domestic legal system of this country. This might also be true
of other sources of international law [...]°*

367. Hence, the Claimants argue that in accordance with the 2003 Investment Law and the
Constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic, the law to be applied by the Tribunal “is comprised of the
Kyrgyz Investment Law and other relevant rules of Kyrgyz law, international conventions and

treaties to which the Kyrgyz Republic is a party and general international law”. *”

368. The Claimants refer to Article 2(3) of the 2003 Investment Law, which provides that in
case of contradiction between the provisions of such law and international agreements, the latter
shall apply. This is taken as a confirmation that international law is integrated into the legal regime
governing investments; it necessarily follows, according to the Claimants, that international law

must be part of the applicable law relevant to the application of the 2003 Investment Law.>”

Statement of Claim, at para. 182, referring to Article 6 of the Constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic of 27 June 2010
(with English translation) (Authority CLA-102). The Tribunal notes that the Respondent translates this provision as
follows: “3. International treaties to which the Kyrgyz Republic is a party that have entered into force under the
established legal procedure and also the universally recognized principles and norms of international law shall be the
constituent part of the legal system of the Kyrgyz Republic. The provisions of international treaties on human rights
shall have direct action and be of priority in respect of provisions of other international treaties.” in Constitution of

369. The Claimants contend that, as the Respondent has ratified the Moscow Convention, its
substantive protections are relevant and part of the law applicable to the present arbitration. *7!
The Claimants contest the Respondent’s objection that the Moscow Convention would only

protect the direct investments of foreign investors as unsupported.*”* According to the Claimants,

they qualify as protected investors*” under the Moscow Convention and have made investments

as defined under the Convention,*” thus bringing them within its scope of application as defined

under its Article 2(2). 575

370. The Claimants argue that the relevance and applicability of international instruments
and general international law has been expressly confirmed by the Decree of the Provisional
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic about Protection of Investments issued on 26 April 2010
(“2010 Investment Protection Decree”).*”° The Claimants aver that such decree was a unilateral
act, made public by the Head of Government and addressed to the international community, which

binds the Kyrgyz Republic and creates binding international obligations. *”

371. The Claimants address the Respondent’s contention that it could not have intended to
offer an “unqualified jurisdictional regime” to investors under the 2003 Investment Law by
arguing that Article 18 of the 2003 Investment Law allows a foreign investor to submit to

arbitration any dispute arising during the implementation of its investment—a notion that is not

limited in scope, and in line with the stated goal of attracting foreign investment. *

372. Likewise, the Claimants disagree that allowing investors to arbitrate customary

international law claims would undermine “the deliberate decision by the Kyrgyz legislature to

provided for by Kyrgyz law”. The Claimants argue that a State cannot abrogate its international
law obligations by means of municipal law.*” Article 2(3) of the 2003 Investment Law expressly

gives priority to international treaties over the provisions of the Law.**°

b. The Respondent’s Position

373. The Respondent alleges that Article 2(1) is not an applicable law clause.**!' Read within
the context of the entirety of Article 2, Article 2(1) must be understood as simply a definitional
section, whose purpose is limited to the application of the specific investment protection standard
of regulatory stability. It merely enumerates the normative sources which comprise the Kyrgyz
“investment regime”.**?

374. The Respondent also rejects the Claimants’ argument that Article 2(3) of the 2003
Investment Law confirms that international law is integrated in the Kyrgyz investment regime
and takes priority over the 2003 Investment Law.*** The Respondent states that the interpretation
of Article 2 put forward by the Claimants would render Article 3(1) devoid of meaning, as the
only plausible interpretation of the latter is that it defines the claims which may be brought under

the 2003 Investment Law. ***

375. The Respondent adds that, even if Article 2(1) were an applicable law clause, it would
not make international treaties and general international law applicable to the present

arbitration.**> The Respondent points out that Article 2(1) defines “[t]he legislation regulating the

investment regime”, which includes “laws and normative legal acts of the Kyrgyz Republic”.**°

In turn, “normative legal acts” is exhaustively defined by Article 4(1) of the Law on Normative

Legal Acts, a provision that does not enumerate international treaties or customary international

law.587

376. The Respondent further argues that, as explained by its expert, Ms. Jorupbekova,
Kyrgyz legislative practice demonstrates that, where international law is intended to form part of
a particular regime, the law specifically provides so.*** In this regard, the Respondent notes that
neither Article 3(1) nor Article 2(1) of the 2003 Investment Law refer to international treaties or
customary international law.**?

377. The Respondent contends that Article 6(3) of the Constitution makes international
treaties or customary international law part of the Respondent’s legal system but it does not make
it part of “[t]he legislation regulating the investment regime” nor part of directly applicable
Kyrgyz law.**° The Respondent clarifies that the only exception is with regard to international
human rights treaties which pursuant to Article 6(3) have “direct action”.*°! Accordingly, there is
no provision of direct enforceability of other international treaties or customary international
law.*? The Respondent notes that it has relied on international law conventions and precedents
only to rebut the Claimants’ submissions under international law, or in the alternative. °°?

378. The Respondent criticizes as misplaced the reliance by the Claimants on Wena Hotels
v. Egypt (Decision on Annulment), arguing that the applicability of international law in a domestic

legal system is a matter of the State’s constitutional structure.**

379. The Respondent also alleges that the interpretation of Article 2(1) of the 2003
Investment Law set forth by the Claimants would lead to absurd results. *°° It would mean that
the jurisdiction of a tribunal established under the 2003 Investment Law would be capable of
almost unlimited expansion.*”° The Respondent notes that similar attempts to use an applicable
law clause to expand the jurisdiction of an international tribunal have been rejected,*”’ and

contends that it would be unreasonable to conclude that the Respondent intended to offer an

“unqualified jurisdictional regime to investors” whereby they could file a claim for the breach of

any international treaty or custom, from the WTO Agreements to the laws of war.°°*

380. Moreover, the Respondent asserts that such interpretation would also render the 2003
Investment Law protections redundant to the extent that they may be equivalent to international
standards of protection; and would also render pointless the decision of the Kyrgyz legislature to
include only certain standards of protection and omit others if it were the case that an investor
could bypass the specific standards provided for in the law by invoking customary international

law. 5%

 

381. The Respondent also argues that the 2010 Investment Protection Decree was issued in

  

the aftermath of a popular uprising by the interim government to address the civil and political
unrest which threatened the investment climate. The Decree merely confirmed that pre-existing
laws continued to apply and “is not an independent legal basis of investment protections and
guarantees”.°’' The Respondent denies that it may amount to a unilateral declaration because “it
manifests no intention by the Kyrgyz Republic to enter into legal obligations on the international

plane”.

382. The Respondent claims that, in the event that the 2003 Investment Law were to allow
investors to bring claims for breaches of international treaties (which the Respondent denies), the
Moscow Convention would still not apply to either of the Claimants.°° The Respondent notes
that the Moscow Convention can only be invoked by foreign investors and it does not contain any
provision allowing a domestic investor to be treated as a foreign investor in certain circumstances;

accordingly Kutisay cannot rely on such instrument.

383. The Respondent also argues that, consistently with the general position under
international law, the Moscow Convention does not protect indirect investments. The Convention

contains no provision that would derogate from the general rule under international law. °°

According to the Respondent, in the absence of any clause within the Moscow Convention that
would authorise limited claims by controlling shareholders, the interpretation favoured by the
Claimants would lead to the “highly unlikely” conclusion that the Convention applies even to
indirect portfolio investments.°°

384. The Respondent further rejects the Claimants’ argument that, where the Moscow
Convention protects certain types of assets it must also protect them when they are indirectly
held.®’ The Respondent rejects such implication and contends that investment treaty tribunals
have concluded that shareholders can bring claims for damage suffered by indirectly held
subsidiaries on the basis of (1) the inclusion of “shares” in the definition of investment, or (2) an
express reference to investment covering “directly or indirectly” held investments. °°’ No similar
clauses are included in the Moscow Convention, which provides for a very narrow definition of

investment. °°

385. The Respondent notes that, in their prayers for relief in their Reply to the Statement of
Defence on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (and subsequent submissions), the
Claimants no longer seek a declaration that the Respondent has breached the Moscow

Convention. °°

ce The Tribunal’s Analysis

386. In the previous section, the Tribunal already averred that it sees no ground for restricting
its jurisdiction to only disputes under the substantive provisions of the 2003 Investment Law,
although, as will become apparent below, the Tribunal considers that the claims in the present
arbitration in fact turn on, and are to be resolved on the basis of, provisions of the 2003 Investment

Law.

387. In any event, the question of jurisdiction must be distinguished from the question of the
law to be applied by the Tribunal in the exercise of its jurisdiction. In relation to the applicable
law, the Tribunal is of the view that international treaties and general international law may in

appropriate circumstances form part of the applicable law. That said, as will become apparent

below, the interpretation and application of provisions of the 2003 Investment Law and other

Kyrgyz legislation are at the core of the present arbitration.

WHETHER STANS ENERGY QUALIFIES AS “INVESTOR” HOLDING AN “INVESTMENT” UNDER
THE 2003 INVESTMENT LAW

388. The Respondent argues that Kyrgyz law only protects direct investments and that the
“indirect ownership by Stans Energy of an interest in Kutisay through an ownership of interest in
Stans KG does not comply with the requirement that an investor must “possess” the relevant

interest”.°!!

389. The Claimants assert that Stans Energy, a company incorporated in Canada, has made
substantial contributions which qualify as direct investments, inter alia, by purchasing all of the
shares in Kutisay Mining OJSC through its wholly owned subsidiary Stans KG.°'? Hence, Stans
Energy qualifies as a foreign investor for the purposes of Article 1(3)(2), first alternative, of the

2003 Investment Law.°!?

390. This jurisdictional objection concerns Article 1 of the 2003 Investment Law, which

provides, in relevant part, as follows:

a. The Respondent’s Position

392. The Respondent contends that the definition of “direct investments” under Kyrgyz law
does not include indirect ownership.°'® The Respondent notes that under Kyrgyz law an
“investor” will only have a “direct investment” if they “possess” or “acquire” the relevant interest;
and the possessor and acquirer is the legal title holder while, where the law intends to cover
indirect ownership, it clearly says so.°'’ Substantive provisions of the 2003 Investment Law refer
to “investors”, which is an expressly defined term in Article 1(3) of such law to include only
investors with “direct investments”.°!* Accordingly, the Respondent submits that Article 18(2)

and the definition of “investment dispute” only cover “investors” with “direct investments”.°'?

393. The Respondent argues that the definition of “direct investment” under Article 1(2) of
the 2003 Investment Law does not include indirectly-owned investments,°° notes that the
Claimants do not provide any expert evidence to support their contention that the definition of
“direct investments” extends to indirect ownership, and suggests that the evidence provided by
its expert should be accepted.®! The Respondent contends that the purpose of providing State
support and protection to investors and investments is to attract direct investments, so “the law

requires direct ownership of an interest in a Kyrgyz entity”.°”

394. The Respondent contends that the 2008 amendment of the definition of “investments”
to cover “contributions of all kind of assets owned or controlled whether directly or indirectly”
does not alter the definition of “direct investments” and does not confirm that possession and
ownership can be direct or indirect, because such an interpretation would render otiose the very

purpose of distinguishing between “investments” and “direct investments”.©>

395. The Respondent notes that Claimants’ attempt to rely on definitions of foreign direct

investment contained in various international publications, including an article of the International

Monetary Fund, an OECD publication and some international case-law. In the Respondent’s
view, all of these are irrelevant for the purposes of interpreting the term “direct investments” in

the 2003 Investment Law.°**

b. The Claimants’ Position
396. The Claimants argue that the 2003 Investment Law also protects indirectly-owned
investments.°°*
397. The Claimants contend that Article 1(1) of the 2003 Investment Law makes this clear

by defining “investment” as assets “owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor”.°

The Claimants note that this was a specific clarification made by the Kyrgyz Parliament in
2008.°’ The Claimants underscore that the Respondent no longer disputes the inclusion of both
directly and indirectly owned and controlled investments under the definition of the term
“investment” under Article 1(1) of the 2003 Investment Law,“* and rather argues that the only
relevant defined term is “investor” which refers in turn to the defined term of “direct
investment”.

398. The Claimants deny the Respondent’s contention that the protection of the 2003
Investment Law only extends to “direct investments”. According to the Claimants, the
Respondent’s position ignores the use of the term “investment” in the 2003 Investment Law, as
“ignoring the statutory text is the only way the Respondent can construct an interpretation of the
2003 Investment Law that excludes from protection all investments owned through intermediate
companies”. “! Rather, the Claimants submit that Article 1(2) excludes portfolio investments, not
indirect investments; and that Article 1(1) and Article 1(2) do not offer conflicting definitions of

a single concept (“investment”).

399. The Claimants note that neither the Preamble nor any of the substantive provisions of
the 2003 Investment Law limit their application to direct investments only,°* and further claim
that through the 2008 clarification of the definition of “investment”, Parliament confirmed its

intention regarding which investments would be protected by the 2003 Investment Law.*™

2. Whether Stans Energy’s Participation in Kutisay Mining LLC Qualifies as a “Direct
Investment”

a. The Respondent’s Position

400. The Respondent asserts that Stans Energy’s indirect shareholding in Kutisay Mining
LLC is not a “direct investment” within Article 1(2) of the 2003 Investment Law as it does not

include indirectly held investments.°*°

401. The Respondent avers that the 2003 Investment Law does not allow an investor to bring
aclaim for injuries suffered by a company of which it is an indirect shareholder, and Stans Energy
cannot bring a claim with respect to damage allegedly suffered by Kutisay Mining LLC. The
Respondent contends that the scope of the 2003 Investment Law is limited to protecting “direct
investments” which are defined by reference to an investor’s participation in a particular legal

entity requiring “possession and acquisition [...] of not less than one third of the shares”.°*”

402. Ms. Jorupbekova asserts that “possession” and “acquisition” are legal concepts under
Kyrgyz law which refer to the “legal title holder of the participating interest in a company, whose
name appears in the company register”.°** Stans Energy does not have a participating interest in

Kutisay Mining LLC.°?

403. Regarding the Claimants’ contention that Stans Energy’s indirect “assets and
contributions” to Kutisay Mining LLC would qualify as “investments” pursuant to Article 1(1) of
the 2003 Investment Law, the Respondent notes that, regardless of whether or not this is the case,
such involvement is insufficient to satisfy “the separate and distinct requirement, for the purposes
of Article 18(2), that Stans Energy has a “direct investment” within the meaning of Article
12)".

b. The Claimants’ Position

404. The Claimants note that Stans Energy holds, through its wholly owned and controlled
Kyrgyz subsidiary, Stans KG, 100% of the share capital in Kutisay Mining LLC.™! The Claimants
contend that this shareholding satisfies the general and specific criteria of the investment
definition under Article 1(1) of the 2003 Investment Law and constitutes an “asset” while also

qualifies as “stock and other forms of participation in a legal entity”.

405. According to the Claimants, Stans Energy’s participation in Kutisay Mining LLC meets
the requirements laid out in Article 1(2) for a “direct investment”. The Claimants aver that the
Respondent has not contested that Stans Energy has a participation of “not less than one-third ...
in business enterprises of other legal forms” in Kutisay Mining LLC.“ The Claimants contend
that the fact that this participation is owned indirectly through the shareholding of Stans KG is

immaterial.

406. The Claimants point out that the Respondent accepts that Stans Energy is a foreign
investor.“ The Claimants consider that “Article 1(3) does not preclude the participating interest
in Kutisay Mining from being held through Stans KG; indeed, Article 1(1) expressly envisages
such a situation”.“” Hence, Stans Energy satisfies the provisions of Article 1(1) to (3) of the 2003

Investment Law and is a foreign investor with an investment protected under this law.°*

3. Whether Stans Energy’s Participation in Stans KG Qualifies As a “Direct
Investment”

a. The Respondent’s Position

407. The Respondent criticizes the Claimants’ interpretation of “direct investments” and
avers that it would lead to “potentially absurd results [...] that a qualifying ‘direct investment’ by
an ‘investor’ in company A, will automatically make it an ‘investor’ with regard to a non-

qualifying investment in company B”.“?

408. The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ argument that “Stans Energy’s investment in
Stans KG is ‘closely related to the present dispute’ [a]s irrelevant” claiming that Kyrgyz law is
specific about the rights and obligations of shareholders in relation to an entity in which it owns
shares and that such rights “do not extend towards shareholders of shareholders”. °? The
Respondent contends that “Stans Energy allegedly qualifying shares in Stans KG (the ‘direct

investment’, according to the Claimants’ submission), are therefore irrelevant”.°*!

409. The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ contention that, even if the 2003 Investment
Law were to protect only directly-owned investments, the Tribunal would still have jurisdiction
regarding the alleged loss of “100% interest in the capital of Stans KG”.°*? The Respondent points
out that the Claimants rely on two ICSID cases based on bilateral investment treaties, which are

irrelevant for interpreting the jurisdictional preconditions of the 2003 Investment Law.°?

410. In any case, the subject matter of the dispute concerns the purported expropriation of
the Kutisay Mining LLC’s Licenses, so Stans KG’s rights were unaffected by the Respondent’s
measures, and none of the cases invoked by the Claimants allow them to pierce the corporate veil
to the extent the Claimants purport to do in these proceedings.*™ Hence, even if Stans Energy

were able to establish jurisdiction on the basis of its shareholding in Stans KG, it would have no

standing to bring a claim for damages suffered by an indirect subsidiary. The claim should thus

in any event be dismissed as inadmissible.°*

b. The Claimants’ Position

All. The Claimants argue that, even accepting arguendo the Respondent’s position that the
2003 Investment Law only protects directly-owned investments, Stans Energy’s participation in

Stans KG qualifies as a “direct investment”.°°

412. Stans Energy directly owned 100% of the capital of Stans KG (a Kyrgyz company),°*”

and it made capital investments in the assets of Stans KG and Kutisay Mining LLC, both of which

qualify as investments under the 2003 Investment Law.**

413. The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s contention that Stans Energy cannot bring
a claim with respect to damage suffered by Kutisay Mining LLC because the 2003 Investment
Law would not allow an investor to file claims for injuries suffered by a company of which it is
an indirect shareholder is unfounded.*° The Claimants note that this law grants an investor rights
with regard to investments “owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor”.°°

414. Nevertheless, even accepting the Respondent’s position, the Claimants aver that the
Tribunal would still have jurisdiction over Stans Energy’s claims regarding its shareholding in
Stans KG.®! Independently of any damage suffered by Kutisay Mining LLC, “Stans Energy has
the right to claim for any damage caused to its directly owned investments, including its 100%

interest in the capital of Stans KG”.

415. The Claimants note the Respondent’s allegation that Stans Energy’s direct investments
are not the assets which are the subject of these proceedings.*® In contrast, the Claimants sustain

that Stans Energy’s shareholding in Stans KG and its capital investments:

are part of the investment project concerning the exploration and development of the
Kutessay I and Kalesay mines [...] The expropriation of the mining licenses and the rights
attached to them “directly caused a concomitant reduction in the value of Stans KG’s
shareholding in Kutisay Mining. And, this caused an equal reduction in the value of Stans
Energy’s shareholding in Stans KG.

416. Accordingly, Stans Energy is an investor protected by the 2003 Investment Law and,
even disregarding its indirect ownership in Kutisay Mining LLC, is entitled under the 2003
Investment Law to claim compensation for the damage caused by the Respondent to its

shareholding in Stans KG and to its directly-owned investments.°°*

4, The Tribunal’s Analysis

417. As mentioned above, the Tribunal considers the issues addressed by the Parties in the

above sections | to 3 together, as they are interlinked.

418. Article 1(1) of the 2003 Investment Law provides a particularly wide definition of
“investment”. In particular, its very first introductory phrase expressly mentions that it includes
“contributions of all kinds of assets, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor”.°°
Since neither the Preamble nor any of the substantive provisions of the 2003 Investment Law
relevant in this case limit their application to direct investments only, the definition of “direct
investment” in subparagraph 2 of Article | is not relevant in this context. Therefore the Tribunal
has no doubt that in application of the specific definition of “investment” in subparagraph | of
Article 1, it has jurisdiction, and claims are admissible over such substantive provisions as those
that will be examined later in this award irrespective of whether the Claimants’ investments in

the Kyrgyz Republic are direct or indirect investments.

419. With regard to the Respondent’s reasoning, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that

Articles 1(1) and 1(2) serve entirely different purposes. Indeed this is even clearer in view of the

2008 modification of Article 1(1) of the 2003 Investment Law” by which the Kyrgyz Parliament
clarified that “investment” includes not only assets owned directly, but also those “owned or
controlled directly or indirectly” by an investor. Meanwhile, the legislator left Article 1(2)
untouched, because this provision did not deal with the issue of ownership. The Parliament thus
confirmed that “direct investment” does not mean a directly-owned investment, and does not

exclude investments owned or controlled through intermediate companies.°*

420. As the Tribunal has found above that it has jurisdiction over both direct and indirect
investments, it is not relevant whether Stans Energy’s participation in Kutisay Mining LLC and

in Stans KG qualify as a “Direct Investment”.

WHETHER KUTISAY MINING LLC QUALIFIES AS AN “INVESTOR” HOLDING AN
“INVESTMENT” UNDER THE 2003 INVESTMENT LAW

421. The Respondent argues that Kutisay Mining LLC does not qualify as a “foreign
investor” nor as an “investor” with a qualifying “direct investment”.% The Claimants, on the
other hand, assert that Kutisay Mining LLC qualifies as a foreign investor under Article 1(3)(2),

422. The Respondent argues that only an “investor” with a “direct investment” can

commence arbitration under Article 18(2) of the 2003 Investment Law.°”!

423. The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ argument that the mining licenses held by
Kutisay Mining LLC and the rights they represent to develop and exploit REEs are assets that

qualify as investments under Article 1(1) of the 2003 Investment Law.*” The Respondent

considers that the Licenses do not fall within the definition of “direct investment” under Article
1(2) of the 2003 Investment Law,*” and criticizes that the Claimants seek to eliminate the words
“direct investment” from the definition of “investor” precisely because it is the jurisdictional

requirement which Kutisay Mining LLC is unable to fulfil.°“

424. The Respondent reiterates that Article 18(2) of the 2003 Investment Law and the
definition of “investment dispute” only cover “investors” with “direct investments”. °° The
Licenses do not fall within the definition of “direct investment” under Article 1(2) of the 2003

Investment Law and the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Kutisay’s claims.°”

b. The Claimants’ Position

425. The Claimants argue that Kutisay Mining LLC qualifies as “investor”.°” In this regard,
the Claimants assert that Kutisay Mining LLC held Licenses, granted by the SAGMR, under
which it had the right to develop and exploit rare earth deposits of the Kutessay II mine and
beryllium and lead deposits of the Kalesay mine for the period from December 2009 to December
2029. These Licenses and the rights they represent are assets which qualify as investments under

the general provision of Article 1(1) of the 2003 Investment Law.**

426. Moreover, the Claimants aver that they have held the “right to engage in activity based
on a license of other permit issued by government bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic” and
“concessions based on laws of the Kyrgyz Republic including concessions to prospect for,
explore, develop or exploit natural resources of the Kyrgyz Republic’”—categories specifically

listed as protected investments in Article 1(1).6”

427. The Claimants also maintain that they expended considerable amounts to develop the
mining project, acquired transformation and transportation facilities and conducted extensive

studies concerning the feasibility of the project, all of which would qualify as investments under

Article 1(1) of the 2003 Investment Law as “money”, “movable and immovable property”,

“property rights (mortgages, liens, pledges and others)”, and “non-property rights (including
intellectual property rights including goodwill, copyrights, patents, trademarks, industrial designs,
technological processes, trade names and know-how)”.°*°

428. The Claimants recall the Respondent’s position that none of these investments are
protected by the 2003 Investment Law “because the law only protects shareholder rights or
“capital investments in fixed assets of its “branch” or “representative office”... of a legal entity”.
It would follow from that view that Kutisay Mining LLC could only have been protected if it had
created an additional subsidiary”.**! The Claimants note that this argument is directly contrary to
the Respondent’s own contention that the 2003 Investment Law does not protect indirect

682

investments. It would also render Article 1(1) ineffective insofar it defines investments broadly

(including shares and also hard assets and concession rights) as, pursuant to the Respondent’s

construction, only a subcategory of those would actually be protected. The Claimants contend

that this could not have been the legislator’s intent.

429. The Claimants consider that their interpretation is confirmed by the substantive
provisions of the 2003 Investment Law which refer to “investments” rather than to “direct
investments”. They also point out that Article 18(2) does not refer to “direct investment” but

to “investment dispute”, the definition of which in turn refers to that of “investment”. The phrase

“foreign investor” is not defined by reference to “direct investment”.°*

430. In conclusion, Kutisay Mining LLC had an investment in the form of its Licenses and
other assets related to the development of the Kutessay II and Kalesay mines, which were
protected by the 2003 Investment Law, and constitute a firm basis for the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction.*°

ce The Tribunal’s Analysis

431. Article 1(3) of the 2003 Investment Law provides: “‘Investor’ means a party to
investment activity providing its own, borrowed or attracted funds in the form of direct
investment”.°*”

432. The Claimants correctly point out that Kutisay Mining LLC held Licenses, granted by
the SAGMR, under which it had the right to develop and exploit rare earth deposits of the
Kutessay II mine and beryllium and lead deposits of the Kalesay mine for the period from
December 2009 to December 2029. Indeed, these Licenses and the rights they represent are assets
which qualify as investments under the general provision of Article 1(1) of the 2003 Investment
Law. In this context, the Tribunal refers to its conclusions above regarding what is an investment
according to Article 1(1) and in particular that this provision expressly includes “tangible and
intangible contributions of all kinds of assets, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an
investor, into objects of economic activity” and then also expressly includes “- any right to engage
in activity based on a license or other permit issued by government bodies of the Kyrgyz
Republic”.*

433. In view of the above express provisions the Tribunal has no doubt that Kutisay Mining

LLC qualifies as an “investor”.

2. Whether Kutisay Mining LLC Qualifies as a “Foreign Investor”
a. The Respondent’s Position

434, The Respondent argues that Kutisay Mining LLC does not qualify as a foreign investor
because it is a locally incorporated company which was established with the participation of

another locally incorporated company, Stans KG; and does not meet any of the additional

requirements in subparagraphs (a), (b) or (c) of Article 1(3)(2).%°

435. The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ interpretation that subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c)
of Article 1(3)(2) merely clarify what constitutes foreign participation. In the Respondent’s view,
nothing in those subparagraphs suggests that indirect foreign participation is permissible.°°
436. The Respondent underscores that, under the law of the Kyrgyz Republic, Kutisay
Mining is established with participating interest of Stans KG (a locally incorporated limited
liability company), and Dr. Savchenko (a Kyrgyz citizen).®' It further argues that “participation”
ina legal entity has a specific meaning under Kyrgyz law, referring only to direct participation in
such entity.” Accordingly, the indirect interest of Stans Energy in Kutisay Mining LLC does not
satisfy the requirement of “foreign participation”.

437. Regarding the additional requirements put forward in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of
Article 1(3)(2), the Respondent notes that the Claimants only rely on (b) and (c) to establish the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction.’ The Respondent contends that the Claimants have not provided
evidence showing that Stans Energy “controlled and managed” Kutisay pursuant to “a written
contract, right to sell majority of shares, right to appoint majority of members of the executive or

2» 695

supervisory bodies Regarding subparagraph (c), which requires that “not less than one third

of the shares or shareholders’ votes are in the ownership of foreign individuals [...]”, the
Respondent claims that it only applies to joint stock companies, which Kutisay Mining LLC is
not. Since Kutisay Mining LLC has no shares or shareholders votes, it is automatically outside
the scope of subparagraph (c).°° The Respondent avers that the Claimants are inviting the
Tribunal to ignore the legislative text. In the Respondent’s submission, limited liability companies
may only qualify as foreign investors under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of Article 1(3)(2).°”
Subparagraph (c) is clear in that it only applies to joint stock companies, which Kutisay Mining
LLC is not.®* It is inconsequential that the Claimants consider that the Kyrgyz legislature has no

basis to distinguish between different types of corporate forms, since different treatment is

frequently given to different corporate forms, and there is no valid principle of interpretation

which would lead to an interpretation contrary to the literal meaning of the text.°”

b. The Claimants’ Position

438. The Claimants contend that Kutisay Mining LLC qualifies as a “foreign investor”.

The Claimants aver that, although Kutisay Mining LLC is established under the laws of the
Kyrgyz Republic, it is wholly owned by Stans Energy—a foreign legal entity—through its wholly
owned subsidiary Stans KG. ”! Thus, Kutisay Mining LLC qualifies as a foreign investor under
Article 1(3)(2), second alternative of the 2003 Investment Law.”

439. The Claimants argue that Article 1(3)(2) of the 2003 Investment Law identifies the kind
of Kyrgyz companies which similarly benefit from the protections of a “foreign investor” and
clearly includes “a local company ‘formed with foreign participation”. The Claimants point
out that the law sets forth three conditions and that any company which satisfies any of them
qualifies as a company “formed with foreign participation” and, thus, as a “foreign investor”.”
440. The Claimants argue that Kutisay Mining LLC corresponds to both subparagraphs (b)
and (c) as it was at all relevant times managed and controlled by Stans Energy as the sole

participant in Stans KG.7°5

441. The Claimants recall that the Respondent denies that Kutisay Mining LLC may meet
the criteria of Article 1(3)(2)(b) arguing that only Stans KG had any rights vis-a-vis Kutisay
Mining LLC. The Claimants consider this argument as “overly formalistic” as Stans KG was

wholly owned by Stans Energy, and all decisions taken by Stans KG as the shareholder of Kutisay

does not require that control must be direct.””

442. Regarding the fulfilment of the criteria set forth in Article 1(3)(2)(c), the Claimants note
that there is no indication that this provision intended to exclude limited liability companies and
other entities with forms of capital ownership other than shares, and consider such interpretation

as illogical and pointless from a policy viewpoint.”

ce The Tribunal’s Analysis

443. The Tribunal recalls the definition of “foreign investor” in Article 1(3) of the 2003

Investment Law:

“Foreign investor” means any individual or legal entity, other than domestic investor,
investing in the economy of the Kyrgyz Republic, including:

1) an individual being a foreign national (or stateless person) permanently residing outside
the Kyrgyz Republic;

2) a legal entity that is:

formed and registered under the laws of a foreign State; or

formed with foreign participation, i.e. established under the laws of the Kyrgyz Republic,
and:

a) fully owned by one or more foreign individuals or legal entities; or

b) controlled and managed by one or more foreign individuals or legal entities pursuant to a
written contract, a right to sell the majority of shares, a right to appoint the majority of
members to its executive or supervisory bodies; or

c) in which not less than one-third of shares or shareholders’ votes is owned by foreign
individuals, or stateless persons permanently residing abroad, or by legal entities referred to
in this clause;

3) a legal entity that is founded by an inter-governmental treaty of the Kyrgyz Republic;
4) a foreign organization which is not a legal entity:

5) an international organization.”

444, Kutisay Mining LLC is established under the laws of the Kyrgyz Republic, but
is wholly owned by Stans Energy—a foreign legal entity—through its wholly owned subsidiary
Stans KG.

445. With regard to the criteria of Article 1(3)(2)(b) the Tribunal notes that Stans KG was
wholly owned by Stans Energy, and all decisions taken by Stans KG as the shareholder of Kutisay
Mining LLC were first adopted and authorised by Stans Energy and that Article 1(3)(2)(b) does
not require that control must be direct. Rather, as concluded above, the definition of “investment”

in Article 1(1) expressly includes “indirect” ownership and control.

446. The Tribunal cannot agree with the Respondent’s argument that subparagraph (c) is
clear in that it only applies to joint stock companies. The definition of “foreign investor” in Article
1(3) is very wide which is in line with the primary intention of the 2003 Investment Law as
referred to in its Preamble: “This Law sets forth the main principles of the national investment
policy aiming at improving the investment climate in the republic and promoting the flow of local
and foreign investment by providing investors with a fair and equitable legal regime and
guaranteeing protection of their investments made into the economy of the Kyrgyz Republic.”"°
In view of this express intention of the 2003 Investment Law, and as there is no indication
otherwise, the Tribunal considers that Article 1(3)(2) is not intended to exclude limited liability
companies from subparagraph (c), so that these could qualify as foreign investors only under

subparagraphs (a) and (b).
447. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Kutisay Mining LLC qualifies as a “foreign

investor”.

WHETHER THE CLAIMS SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THE CLAIMANTS ACQUIRED
THEIR INVESTMENTS THROUGH CORRUPTION

448. The Respondent further contends that the claims should be dismissed on the basis that

the investments were obtained through corruption. The Claimants reject these allegations.

1. The Respondent’s Position

449. The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ claims should be dismissed because they
obtained their Licenses through corruption. ’!'! According to the Respondent, this illegality
permeates the acquisition of the Licenses. The Respondent concludes that, regardless of whether
this objection goes to jurisdiction or to admissibility, the Tribunal must dismiss a claim tainted
with such illegality, and notes that investment tribunals have consistently dismissed claims where

serious wrongdoing has tainted the investment.”

450. The Respondent alleges that the Claimants paid a bribe in breach of Kyrgyz, Canadian,
and international law in order to acquire the Licenses and bypass the legal requirement that they

be allocated through a tender.”"7

451. The Respondent contests that there is, as argued by the Claimants, any heightened
standard of proof regarding corruption allegations,” noting that tribunals have accepted that such

allegations can be proven through circumstantial evidence,”!>

and may also be “inferred from
objective factual circumstances.”7'® The Respondent also argues that tribunals may draw adverse
inferences from the failure of a party to produce documentation””” and shift the burden of proof
to the allegedly corrupt party where there is a reasonable indication of corruption. ”'* The
Respondent relies on the decision in Spentex v. Uzbekistan, which held that “elements of bribery

are made out ‘even if the final recipients of the bribe payments were not known’.”"°

452. Accordingly, the Respondent submits that it is not necessary to prove the Claimants’

knowledge of the ultimate recipient of the bribe nor their knowledge of “(a) each and every

intermediary used to siphon the illicit payment to the ultimate recipient; or (b) the actual transfers
that took place between the offshore company client accounts of AUB following the payment to
Vesatel.””° Furthermore, the Respondent claims that it is not necessary to prove that the investor
actually engaged in corruption. Quoting the tribunal in Minotte v. Poland, the Respondent asserts
that in some circumstances “the deliberate closing of eyes to evidence of serious misconduct or
crime [...] would indeed vitiate a claim”.”!

453. The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ explanation for their overpayment
(namely that such payment “could be retained by the Development Fund to finance its own
activities”) lacks credibility: the payment was solicited during a telephone call.” Moreover, the
tariffs payable for acquiring the Licenses were expressly stipulated by law, and the Development
Fund had no role in the allocation of mining licenses. Finally, Stans Energy must have known
that the Licenses had to be allocated through a competitive tender.”"? The Respondent also
underscores the particular circumstances in which the payment was made—as part of a “sham”

auction where Stans KG paid nearly double the starting price despite being the only bidder.”

454. The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ failure to disclose, inter alia, documents
related to their meetings with Mr. Eliseev, as ordered by the Tribunal pursuant to a request from
the Respondent in the document production phase, must lead to the drawing of adverse inferences
by the Tribunal.”> According to the Respondent, the only plausible explanation is that Stans
Energy made a corrupt payment in order to procure the Licenses, thereby bypassing the legal
requirement of a tender.”° Furthermore, the Respondent submits that the ultimate recipients of

the bribe in this case were clearly “the Minister who secretly asked Mr Aryev for the double

payment and Mr Eliseev [...] who promised his assistance[.]””””

455. The Respondent asserts that it has provided extensive evidence that the Claimants

obtained their Licenses through bribery.”* Nevertheless, even if the Tribunal does not find “proof

of actual knowledge, C[laimant]s at best engaged in wilful blindness. This is sufficient to vitiate
the claim.””” The Claimants’ conduct, the Respondent contends, amounts to corruption under the
two main international treaties which address it: (1) the 2003 United Nations Convention against
Corruption (“Merida Convention”) and (2) the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of
Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (“OECD Convention”).”° The
Claimants’ conduct would amount to bribery under both treaties as the Claimants provided an
undue advantage (i.e. the double payment), and they obtained an undue advantage in return

aL

through the creation of an ad hoc scheme for the allocation of the Licenses.”' The Respondent

notes in this regard that bribery in international law extends to indirect payments.”*?

456. The Respondent contends that the “defences” put forward by the Claimants do not
exonerate them.”* The Claimants’ explanation for the overpayment—that the Claimants were not
bidding for the Licenses but for the shares of a State-owned company, and that only the price of
the former was fixed by law—is disputed by the Respondent. As the Respondent argues, the
Licenses were the only asset of Kutisay, so the value of that company at the time of the auction
“was equal only to the license fees due in their respect”.”* The Respondent also denies the
Claimants’ contention that they did not receive any undue advantage. That contention, the
Respondent argues, is contradicted by Claimants themselves, who have admitted that “the total
purchase price ... reflected ... substantially less than the market value of the projects at the
time”.” Finally, the Respondent contends that “even if the Claimants genuinely believed that
their overpayment would be used to fund the Development Fund’s projects, it would still amount
to a bribe”.”°

457. The Respondent submits that a tribunal should decline to exercise jurisdiction where a
transaction has been entered into in violation of public policy norms, such as the Merida

Convention and the OECD Convention.”’ The Claimants also paid a bribe under Kyrgyz law.

The Respondent argues that the fact that the Kyrgyz Criminal Code applied only to individuals,
and not to corporations, is not relevant here, since the matter at issue in this arbitration is not the

individual criminal liability of the Claimants or their officers.”**

458. The Respondent argues that the fact that the bribe was allegedly requested by public
officials cannot exonerate the Claimants from responsibility for the following reasons: (1) the
Tribunal should not accept the Claimants’ statement that it was public officials who requested the
bribe when, despite the Tribunal’s order for disclosure, the Claimants have produced no
documentary evidence; (2) there was no “extortion” involved; (3) even if an official ““extorted”
money from them, Article 314(3) of the Kyrgyz Criminal Code, while relevant for criminal
liability, does not address the question whether an investor can file a claim for breach of the 2003
Investment Law; and (4) not only Kyrgyz law was violated but also Canadian law, international
law and international public policy, and the Claimants have not explained how any purported
solicitation from public officials would relieve them from responsibility under these legal

norms.”

459. In any event, the Respondent contends that it is not sufficient for the Claimants to plead
ignorance, because the Claimants failed to carry out any due diligence concerning the legality of
the scheme. When confronted with the various warning signs, they were not entitled simply to put
their “head in the sand”.™° The Respondent contends that “it is clear” that the Claimants
conducted no appropriate due diligence before acquiring the Licenses.”*! The assertion that “the

results of the legal due diligence ‘were relayed orally because [Stans] did not need a written

report’ is ludicrous.”

2. The Claimants’ Position

460. The Claimants allege that the Respondent has failed to establish that the Claimants

obtained their Licenses through corruption.” Furthermore, the Claimants contend that, in any

event, the Respondent’s own culpability would exonerate the Claimants.”

461. The Claimants accept that, as a principle of law, the establishment of bribery may bar a

tribunal’s jurisdiction or admissibility of claims; however, they contend that the Respondent has

failed to prove that the Claimants paid a bribe.

462. In this regard, the Claimants aver that, according to the prevailing view, allegations of
criminal activity in international arbitration “are subject to a heightened standard of proof, resting
squarely on the accusing party”.”° They argue that there “is no basis to lower the standard of

proof” as the Respondent contends.”"”

463. The Respondent, so the Claimants allege, operate on “on the false premise that the
Claimants have withheld documents”, and that the Tribunal may therefore “draw adverse
inferences”. According to the Claimants, “the Kyrgyz Republic seeks to achieve the dismissal of
the arbitration on a mere prima facie case of bribery”.”* The Claimants deny having withheld
any documents as they were unable, after a reasonable search, to identify responsive material.”

The drawing of an adverse inference is a last resort for cases where:

(1) the party seeking the inference has produced all available evidence corroborating the
inference sought; (2) the party requesting the adverse inference has established that the party
against whom the inference is sought has access to the evidence sought; (3) the inference is
reasonable, consistent with facts in the record, and logically related to the probable nature of
the evidence withheld; (4) the party seeking the adverse inference has produced prima facie
evidence; and (5) the tribunal has afforded the party against whom the adverse inference is
sought sufficient opportunity to produce evidence prior to drawing adverse inferences against
it. 750

464. According to the Claimants, the Respondent has not addressed these elements. The
drawing of adverse inferences is not justified, the Claimants contend, in circumstances where “not
all of the evidence available to the Respondent on its allegations of bribery has been produced,
where its allegations are inconsistent with its own evidence, and where the Respondent has not

met even the lightest burden of proof”.”*!

465. The Claimants disagree with the Respondent’s proposition that a showing of indicia of
corruption suffices to shift the burden of proof to the Claimants, who would then have to “disprove
its allegations of corruption”.”? The Claimants note that it is a general principle of law that a
party bears the burden of establishing each element of its claim or defence and further argue that,
with regard to allegations of corruption, there is consensus that the evidence should inspire

“reasonable certainty”.”**

466. The Claimants consider that the Respondent has failed to prove any wrongdoing by any
standard and, in particular, has failed to demonstrate any of the key elements of the crime alleged,
namely: (1) that the Claimants made an improper payment to the Respondent’s representatives;

(2) that such payment gave the Claimants an improper advantage; and (3) that the Claimants knew

that the Respondent’s representatives had improperly appropriated funds.”

467. First, the Claimants deny having engaged in bribe-giving and having offered anything
to any official to induce him or her to act or to refrain from acting in the exercise of official
duties.”*° They note that no evidentiary link has been established to the effect that payments were
made to any public official.” In particular, the Claimants were not involved in any of the

subsequent transfers alleged by the Respondent.”*”

468. Regarding the contention that Stans paid more for the Licenses than required by law,
the Claimants aver that, even if overpayment were proven, it should not be regarded as a bribe.”**
The Claimants aver that their conviction that they were engaged in a legitimate transaction is

proven by the fact that the entire amount paid was recorded and publicly disclosed.”

469. Second, the Claimants contend that even if they had paid more than required, they did
not obtain any undue advantage as a result. Hence, there could be no link between the payment
and the allocation of the Licenses,’ and the higher payment could not have been a “red flag”.”°!
The Claimants add that, had an investor acquired the Licenses by tender or direct negotiations, it

“would necessarily have paid more”.”

470. Third, the Claimants aver that, like many of the Respondent’s own authorities at the
time, they had no reason to believe that the Development Fund or the AUB were engaged in any
kind of illegal conduct.’ In the Claimants’ view, Minister Kurmanaliev’s “position in the
Kyrgyz government and the circumstances of the request... confirmed that he was acting within
the scope of his official capacity and in the name of the Kyrgyz State”.” Moreover, the allegedly
suspicious “circumstances” of the payment, the Claimants contend, were within the Respondent’s

“exclusive knowledge and control [...] Claimants were entirely in the dark about the auction

process”.7°>

471. The Claimants also deny the Respondent’s contention that they could have been guilty
of bribery even if they “genuinely believed” that the Development Fund would use their payment
appropriately.” According to the Claimants, there can be no bribery if Stans Energy had no
intention of giving a benefit in order to receive an improper favour from an official, and intent

has not been proven.””

472. In sum, the Claimants contend that it is possible, although not proven, that public
officials may have stolen money from their payment but this would amount to embezzlement and
not to bribery.”°* As the Respondent has failed to establish the Claimants’ involvement in any

improper activity, the Tribunal should uphold its jurisdiction.”

473. In any event, the Claimants further argue that, should their payment be considered a

bribe, it would have been then solicited by the Kyrgyz authorities’” and, as a matter of Kyrgyz

law, this would exonerate the Claimants.””!

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

474, From its Procedural Order No. 9 regarding Post-Hearing Procedures, the Tribunal

recalls its Questions | and 2:

Jurisdiction

1. Assuming that the Tribunal accepts the scheme described by Mr. Beysheyev in his witness
testimony as true, what is the evidence on the record that the Claimants (i) were aware or (ii)
could have been expected to be aware of it? Based on that evidence, what are the legal
consequences for the Claimants’ claims in these proceedings?

2. Assuming that the Tribunal concludes that the 29 December 2009 auction at the Central
Asian Stock Exchange was contrary to Kyrgyz law, what is the evidence on the record that
the Claimants (i) were aware or (ii) could have been expected to be aware of such
unlawfulness? What would be the legal consequence if the auction was contrary to Kyrgyz
law but the Claimants were unaware of it?

475. Further, the Tribunal points out that the Respondent has the burden of proof regarding

its allegation that the Claimants acquired their investment through corruption.

476. As the Parties have argued the issue of corruption referring to the issues addressed both
in the above Questions | and 2, the Tribunal will also address both in conjunction. The first issue
is whether the circumstances under which the Claimants made payments and received their

Licenses are proven to show corruption. In this context, the Tribunal first focusses on evidence

for corruption and will, should it not find that corruption is proven, only thereafter in Section V.E
of this Award examine whether, even without corruption, a breach of Kyrgyz law would have the

effect of depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction or rendering the Claimants’ claims inadmissible.

477. As summarized above, the Respondent contends that the Claimants’ explanation for
their overpayment (namely that such payment “could be retained by the Development Fund to
finance its own activities”) lacks credibility: the payment was solicited during a telephone call.”””
Moreover, the tariffs payable for acquiring the Licenses were expressly stipulated by law, and the
Development Fund had no role in the allocation of mining licenses. Finally, Stans Energy must
have known that the Licenses had to be allocated through a competitive tender.’”? The Respondent
also underscores the particular circumstances in which the payment was made—as part of a
“sham” auction where Stans KG paid nearly double the starting price despite being the only
bidder.”

478. In this context, the Tribunal accepts as plausible the Claimants’ argument that, like
many of the Respondent’s own authorities at the time, they had no reason to believe that the
Development Fund or the AUB were engaged in any kind of illegal conduct.””° In the Claimants’
view, Minister Kurmanaliev’s position in the Kyrgyz Government and the circumstances of his
request for a higher payment could indeed be taken as showing that he was acting within the scope
of his official capacity and in the name of the Kyrgyz Republic. The allegedly suspicious
“circumstances” of the payment were within the Respondent’s exclusive knowledge and control
and the Claimants were neither acquainted nor in control of the auction process. Among other
circumstances, the Tribunal regards it as significant that the Claimants made the entirety of the
requested payment to the official bank account of the Development Fund, in a regular transaction
recorded in the Claimants’ books—this situation differs markedly from a scenario in which part
of a payment is made in cash or to the bank account of a third party. Therefore, the Tribunal also
does not find that the Respondent, which has the burden of proof, has provided sufficient evidence

that the Claimants engaged in wilful blindness.

479. On the other hand, from the evidence provided, the Tribunal accepts the scheme
described by Mr. Beysheyev in his witness testimony and confirmed in his oral testimony at the
hearing as proven and accepts that, indeed, after the Claimants had paid, this evidence seems to
show that the further processing of the payment was suspicious. But all of this processing occurred
within the Respondent’s system and control. And even in reply to the Tribunal’s Question No. |
quoted above, no evidence has been provided by the Respondent that the indeed suspicious details
of the scheme described by Mr. Beysheyev were known to the Claimants. They can therefore not

be attributed to the Claimants.

480. Regarding the Respondent’s allegation that the Claimants have withheld documents,
and that the Tribunal may therefore draw adverse inferences, the Tribunal sees no reason to doubt
the Claimants’ assurance that they were unable, after a reasonable search, to identify further

responsive material.

481. In conclusion, therefore, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not provided
evidence that is sufficient to show that the Claimants have obtained the investment by corruption

or at least must have recognized corruption to be involved.

WHETHER THE CLAIMS SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THE CLAIMANTS ACQUIRED
THEIR INVESTMENTS IN BREACH OF KYRGYZ LAW

482. The Respondent alleges that the Claimants’ claims should be dismissed because they
obtained their Licenses in breach of various provisions of Kyrgyz law: (1) Article 183 of the
Kyrgyz Criminal Code, which prohibits money laundering; (2) Article 16 of the Subsoil Law,
which sets out requirements for public tenders; and (3) Articles 408 and 409 of the Kyrgyz Civil

Code, which lay out requirements for auctions.’

483. The Claimants assert that the 2003 Investment Law “does not prevent disputes arising
out of ‘illegal’ investments from being adjudicated”,”” and even if the 2003 Investment Law

provided for such a legality requirement, it would not set “an absolute bar to jurisdiction”.””* In

any event, the Claimants contend, the Respondent has failed to establish the Claimants’ breaches

of Kyrgyz law that could bar the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.””

484. Since they are interlinked, the Tribunal will examine the issues addressed under

subsections | to 4 hereafter together at the end of this section.

1. Whether and to What Extent the 2003 Investment Law Contains a Legality
Requirement

a. The Respondent’s Position

485. The Respondent avers that claims by investors are to be dismissed when the investment
has been made in breach of the law of the host State and alleges that the requirement that
investments be lawful is both explicit and implicit in the instruments relied upon by the
Claimants.’*° Specifically, the Respondent refers to Article 20(1) of the 2003 Investment Law,
which provides that in carrying out their economic activity investors shall comply with the
legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic, and to Article 4 of the Moscow Convention, which provides
that investors shall have the right to make investments by any method not prohibited by the

legislation of the recipient State.”*!

486. The Respondent alleges that considerations relevant in the context of investment treaty
arbitrations are equally applicable in the context of an arbitration based on an investment law.”
This is so because an offer to arbitrate amounting to a unilateral declaration (within a national
investment law) cannot be interpreted more expansively than a comparable offer within an

investment treaty.”**

487. The Respondent argues that even in the absence of express “legality” requirements,
investment tribunals have confirmed that there is an implicit limitation on their jurisdiction
whenever claims are based on illegal investments.”** The Respondent rejects the Claimants’
contention that there is no support for the possibility to imply a legality requirement, arguing that

there are numerous authorities which favour the existence such obligation,’ and quoting, inter

alia, the Fraport I tribunal which stated that “[...] there is an increasingly well-established
international principle which makes international legal remedies unavailable with respect to
illegal investments ”.7°°

488. The Respondent strongly opposes the Claimants’ contention that through its conduct it
confirmed the legality of the Licenses.”*” According to the Respondent, the Claimants have not
relied on estoppel, waiver, acquiescence or some other legal doctrine, which are not applicable
under Kyrgyz law.”** Even if the alleged conduct is correct, it does not demonstrate any
“confirmation” by the Respondent of the Licenses’ validity.”

489. According to the Respondent, the principle of good faith is a principle under both
international law and Kyrgyz law that prevents an individual from bringing proceedings in
circumstances in which they have committed an “abuse”. The principle is consistent with the
practice of international tribunals to deny protection to an investor if it has “unclean hands” or
acquired its investment in bad faith.”° The Respondent contends that the Claimants were aware
that they were making a corrupt payment, which is reinforced by their apparent lack of
development of due diligence despite numerous red flags.”"' Bribery, corruption and money
laundering are also contrary to international public policy.”” Moreover, the alleged breaches of
Kyrgyz law are serious breaches, which justify that the Tribunal declines to exercise jurisdiction
over the merits.”

490. The Respondent also rejects the appropriateness of following, as alleged by the
Claimants, the balancing approach advocated in Kim v. Uzbekistan for the following reasons: (1)
Article 31 of the VCLT and the preamble of a BIT played a central role in that tribunal’s
conclusions; (2) these considerations are inapplicable in this case, as proportionality is not a

general principle of Kyrgyz law; (3) this reasoning has not been accepted in any subsequent

decision; and (4) even if a balancing exercise were applicable in this case, the breaches by the

Claimants would be sufficiently serious to bar the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.”*

b. The Claimants’ Position

491. The Claimants assert that regardless of whether there was any illegality (which they
deny), the 2003 Investment Law contains no legality requirement and does not prevent disputes

arising from “illegal” investments from being adjudicated.”

492. The Claimants argue that nothing in Article 20 of the 2003 Investment Law, which
provides for the observance of Kyrgyz laws by investors, establishes such observance as a
precondition for protection under the Law or for arbitration under Article 18 of the Law. They
further argue that Article 20(1) applies to “investors”, who by definition, must already have

acquired an investment.’”°

493. Moreover, the Claimants aver that “there is no indication that breach of the legal
compliance obligation in Article 20(1) should result in the exclusion of disputes related to the
investments in question from the protections of the Investment Law”.””” Rather, Article 20(2)
provides for the consequences of non-compliance with Kyrgyz laws by stating that investors will
be subject to normal judicial processes as appropriate for the violation at stake. In contrast with

investment laws adopted by other countries,”** the 2003 Investment Law does not provide for any

limitation or abrogation of rights.””

494, The Claimants contend that, in any event, a legality requirement would be limited in
scope.*” Claimants note that the Respondent relies on the decision in Fraport IJ, a case which
dealt with a bilateral investment treaty, not a municipal investment law.*°! Moreover, they argue

that the Respondent’s allegation that its unilateral consent to arbitration in the investment law

should be treated like a State’s consent to arbitration in a bilateral investment treaty*” “is contrary

to the Respondent’s previous position that the 2003 Investment Law cannot be interpreted as an

international legal instrument”.*”?

495. In any event, even if international law were relevant for the interpretation of the
jurisdictional scope of the 2003 Investment Law, “[t]here is no support for the proposition that an
absolute bar to jurisdiction is to be implied in an instrument that does not so stipulate”.* The
Claimants note that the tribunal in Fraport I was interpreting the express limitation of a treaty

clause and “did not suggest that absent the language it was interpreting such a limitation could be

implied or imported by operation of general legal principles”.*°

496. The Claimants note that even in cases concerning an express “legality” provision in a
treaty, tribunals have been careful in applying such a limitation of jurisdiction and have only
dismissed claims on this ground in certain serious instances where the nature of the violation
justified such a result.*°° The Claimants invoke the Quiborax decision, in which the tribunal held
that an expansive interpretation of the legality requirement “would create deleterious incentives,
as host States would be in a position to strip investors of treaty protection by finding any minor
breach at any time”.*”’ The Claimants contend that a balanced interpretation must be followed,

especially in cases where the legality requirement is implicit (assuming that an implicit

) 808

requirement can actually exist) and they rely on the Kim v. Uzbekistan decision as an example

of such a balanced approach, which:

requires a case-by-case analysis examining both the seriousness of the investor’s conduct and
the significance of the obligation not complied with so as to ensure that the harshness of the
sanction of placing the investment outside of the protections of the BIT is a proportionate

consequence for the violation examined.*°°
497. The Claimants assert that the consistent practice of investment tribunals shows that only
illegal conduct at the time an investment is “made” (and not afterwards) may raise a jurisdictional
bar.*'° Furthermore, illegality that results from the State’s conduct (rather than the Claimants’)
cannot deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction. This follows from the maxim that a party should not

be permitted to benefit from its own wrong.*!!

498. Moreover, the Claimants consider the Respondent’s allegations concerning their
purported engagement in any illegal activity as groundless and a mere an attempt to avoid liability.
As evidence, the Claimants refer to the Respondent’s “ratification” of the Claimants’ activity
through the conclusion of License Agreements No. 2 and 3; allegations of illegality appear for the
first time in these proceedings.*'? The Claimants argue that the Respondent repeatedly confirmed
the legality of the Claimants’ investments through the re-issue of the Licenses in 2010 and the

conclusion of new License Agreements in 2010 and 2012.8"

499. Even if some illegality could be proven, the Claimants reiterate that substantive
protection of, or consent to arbitration under, the 2003 Investment Law are not conditioned by
any legality requirement. In any event, even if it there were such conditionality, it could only
apply in limited circumstances, which have not been proven by the Respondent “even assuming

the breaches of Kyrgyz law as alleged”.*!4

2. Whether the Claims Should Be Barred Because the Licenses Were Obtained in
Breach of the Prohibition of Money Laundering under the Kyrgyz Criminal Code

a. The Respondent’s Position

500. The Respondent contends that the Claimants breached the prohibitions against money

laundering under Kyrgyz law and international law.*'* In particular, the Respondent submits that:

C[laimant]s knew, or at the very least should have known, that the double payment secretly
requested by Minister Kurmanaliev in exchange for the “bullet proof procedure” concocted
by Mr Eliseev and the Minister constituted a bribe that was destined not for the State budget
but for Minister Kurmanaliev, Mr Eliseev and/or their associates. To achieve this, the
proceeds needed to be laundered in a manner similar to that described by Mr Beysheyev.*"

 

 

 

501. The Respondent underscores that Mr. Beysheyev testified at the Hearing that corruption
within the Bakiev regime “was widely perceived by Kyrgyz society at large in 2009, including
that AUB and its chairman, Mr Mikhail Nadel, were connected with and even protected by the

Bakiev regime.”*!7

502. The Respondent argues that “the proceeds of this rigged auction were then rapidly

818

transferred through a series of offshore bank accounts”*'* in breach of the money laundering

prohibition under Article 183 of the Kyrgyz Criminal Code. Specifically:

they sought to make the ownership of criminal revenue (i.e. the bribe) [...] look legitimate
through an auction [...] their actions involved the transfer of assets [...] were undertaken
with the knowledge that the funds represented criminal activity revenue; and this was for the
purpose of concealing the criminality of the assets[.]*"

503. According to the Respondent, the sanctions provided under Kyrgyz law for money
laundering are irrelevant for determining whether the breach of such law justifies the dismissal of
an investment claim.*”° The Respondent also contests the Claimants’ argument that the absence
of criminal charges would show that the violation of money laundering laws did not affect a
significant interest of the Kyrgyz Republic. First, the Respondent argues that the proportionality

principle has no role to play in determining whether the Claimants can bring a claim, and is not a

relevant consideration in determining whether a particular transaction was contrary to
international public policy.*”! In any event, engaging in money laundering infringes “significant

interests” of the Respondent.’

504. The Respondent considers that the fact that some Kyrgyz officials may have been
complicit in a corrupt scheme does not prevent the Respondent from raising such illegality as a

bar to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.**

505. The Respondent reiterates its position that it is irrelevant that the Kyrgyz Criminal Code
only applied to individuals at the relevant time, since the question before this Tribunal is not the
individual criminal liability of the Claimants or its officers but a question of jurisdiction in

circumstances where an investment has been acquired in violation of such norms.*”4

506. The Respondent also refuses the Claimants’ argument that the Claimants’ positive
knowledge of money laundering was required. Rather, according to the Respondent,
“C[laimant]s’ actual knowledge of what happened inside AUB is irrelevant. The question is, how
likely was that to happen in the circumstances (whether in the same or similar manner, whether

in AUB or elsewhere).”*?°

507. Hence, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal should decline jurisdiction because

826

money laundering is contrary to international public policy*’° and any award based upon an

investment procured through or tainted by money laundering is liable to be set aside to prevent a
party from benefitting from its involvement in such illegality.*?’ What Mr. Beysheyev’s evidence
proved, according to the Respondent, was that “as a matter of fact the overpayment went not to

the State but was laundered and dissipated.”***

b. The Claimants’ Position

508. The Claimants assert that the Respondent has failed to prove any breach by the
Claimants of Article 183 of the Kyrgyz Criminal Code.*” In particular, the Claimants contend
that nothing in Mr. Beysheyev’s testimony suggests nor substantiates that Stans Energy would
have engaged in money laundering.**° To the contrary, the Claimants argue that Mr. Beysheyev

confirmed at the Hearing that “no money laundering took place until after the money received by

09831

the Development Fund had been stolen by AUB employees and transferred away.

509. According to the Claimants, it was confirmed during the Hearing that “his investigation

concluded only that employees of AUB stole money from depositors, including the Development

39 $32

Fund, and then moved those funds offshore”,*** while there is no evidence that any government

officials or Development Fund employees would have been involved with “any purported

malfeasance or wrongdoing”.** Rather, the Claimants argue that Mr. Beysheyev’s testimony

2 834

“demonstrates that Stans Energy could not have been aware of any wrongdoing”,** as the alleged

misconduct of AUB’s employees was hidden through “exceptionally complex” schemes,** the

discovery of which:

required considerable investigative work over several years by a specialized department
drawing on police powers and the resources of the Kyrgyz National Bank, and with full
access to AUB’s internal records.*°°

510. According to the Claimants, there is no evidence to support that the mere involvement
of AUB in the transaction should have alerted Stans Energy to potential illicit conduct or that
Stans Energy was “wilfully blind”.**7 On the contrary, the Claimants aver that Mr. Beysheyev’s
testimony confirmed that before 2010, AUB was the largest private bank in the Kyrgyz

large”.™° Therefore, the Claimants consider that the Respondent has not carried its burden of

proof with regard to these allegations.“!

511. Moreover, the Claimants argue that the Criminal Code in force at the relevant time did
not criminalise the conduct of legal entities and for this reason alone the Claimants’ conduct could
not have breached Article 183.” The Claimants also assert that “[k]nowledge that the revenue
was criminally obtained and an intent to conceal it are both essential elements of the crime”,“?
and note that the Respondent has not provided any evidence with regard to these elements.*“* The
Claimants criticize the Respondent’s assertion that knowledge of, or intention to conceal, the
proceeds of a crime are not elements of the crime in either Kyrgyz law or international law.“
According to the Claimants, Article 183 of the Kyrgyz Criminal Code unequivocally requires
criminal intent as an element of the crime of money laundering.*“° This is also the case for the

relevant provisions of the Merida Convention, including the accessorial offence of

“participation”.“47

512. The Claimants also argue that, even if the Respondent could prove a breach of Article

848

183 of the Criminal Code, this would not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction.“* Pursuant to

Article 20(2) of the 2003 Investment Law the consequence would be that investors would be held
liable in accordance with Kyrgyz laws and, thus, face the penalties imposed by Article 183.”
The Claimants underscore that no investigation has been initiated or charges for money laundering
brought against Stans Energy or Kutisay Mining LLC. This, they submit, proves that even if there

had been a violation it did not affect a “significant interest” of the Respondent and deprivation of

protection under the 2003 Investment Law would be disproportionate.**°

attributable to the Respondent. **! The Claimants consider that it would be “absurd” if the

Respondent could deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction on the basis of its own illegal activity.*°?

3. Whether the Claims Should Be Barred Because the Licenses Were Obtained in
Breach of the Tender Requirement Under the Subsoil Law

a. The Respondent’s Position

514. The Respondent asserts that the Licenses for Kutessay II and Kalesay could only be
allocated through tender, as required in Article 16 of the Subsoil Law, because both locations
were listed as sites of national significance, and the Claimants’ bribe was part of a corrupt scheme
to bypass such requirement. * The Respondent avers that Resolution No 736 included an
appendix with a “LIST of Mineral Deposits to be Allocated through Tender” which was accepted
to be the list envisaged by Article 16 of the Subsoil Law.**4 The Respondent rejects the Claimants’
argument that this was merely a tax resolution, which had no force in other areas, and alleges that
it is irrelevant whether this Resolution includes any specific reference to Article 16 because its

wording precisely mirrors such Article.**5

515. The Respondent notes that Resolution No 725 was passed precisely in an attempt to
modify the tender requirement set forth in Resolution No 736.*°° However, the Respondent argues
that Resolution No 725 was not in force on 21 December 2009, so it could not provide a legal
basis for the Minutes adopted on that date (the invalidity of which has been confirmed by Kyrgyz
courts). *’ The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ contention that Resolution No 725 was
“published” on 4 December 2009, noting that the Claimants are referring to the date of inclusion

of the Resolution in the State Register of Laws.*** In addition, however, there is the requirement

of official publication in a gazette, the “Erkin-Too”, which must be complied with before a

regulation comes into force.**? Such official publication only occurred on 25 December 2009.*°

516. Even if Resolution No 725 had been in force (which is denied), such Resolution was
invalid because it stood in conflict with hierarchically superior legal acts.**! In any event, Kutisay
did not satisfy the applicable requirements for direct negotiations under the Subsoil Law.* The
Respondent argues that there is no proof that the Claimants were even aware of Resolution No

725 when acquiring the Licenses.**

517. The Respondent rejects the contention that any breaches were entirely its fault, claiming
that: (1) the Claimants were complicit in the “bullet-proof” scheme; (2) the Claimants have
advanced no principled reason why the decisions in the cases they have relied on might be
applicable to a claim under the 2003 Investment Law; and (3) even if they were not complicit in
the illegalities (which the Respondent denies), they should be denied protection under the 2003

Investment Law as they failed to carry out adequate due diligence and were “wilfully blind”.**

518. The Respondent also rejects the Claimants’ contention that they can rely on the 2003
Investment Law on the basis that they had “a good faith belief that the 2009 transfer was legal”.**
The Respondent points out that, contrary to the Claimants’ suggestion, the Tribunal’s position in
Kim v. Uzbekistan was actually that “/a]n action in good faith possibly may render an act of
noncompliance less serious, but — depending on the seriousness of the law violated — not
necessarily” °°

519. The Respondent denies that the Claimants’ agreement to proceed without a tender could
have been motivated by “negative experience with a tender process in the Kyrgyz Republic

previously. If this were true, the Claimants should have ensured that any acquisition complied

with the law. By deciding to proceed without a tender, “Stans chose to accept the risk that the

Prosecutor would ultimately discover the illegal grant, and refer it to the court.”°**

b. The Claimants’ Position

520. The Claimants aver that the Respondent has failed to prove any breach by the Claimants

of the tender requirements for the obtainment of Licenses under the Subsoil law.

521. The Claimants contend that Article 16 of the Subsoil Law did not preclude direct
negotiations insofar Kutessay II and Kalesay were not “sites of national significance”.*” There
were no “sites of national significance” in 2009.*”! It was only in 2013 that the Respondent issued

a decision which for the first time included a list of such areas with direct reference to the Subsoil

872

Law.*” On the Claimants’ account, the Respondent merely invokes a tax resolution (Resolution

No 736), which lists sites accorded particular fiscal treatment but does not refer to the Subsoil
Law and has nothing to do with subsoil regulation or licensing.‘ In any event, “Resolution 736
was superseded by the subsequent issuance of Resolution 725: both were instruments of equal

ranking in the hierarchy of laws of the Kyrgyz Republic, and Resolution 725 was more

specific”.$4

522. The Claimants also address the Respondent’s contention that Resolution No 725 was
not in force at the relevant time, contending that such Resolution was published on 4 December
2009*” and entered in force 15 days after such publication.*”* It was accordingly in force before

the transfer of the Licenses to Kutisay Mining.*” In response to the Respondent’s argument that

the Resolution was not published in the “Erkin-Too” Gazette until 25 December 2009,*” the

Claimants note that it was officially published in the State Register of Laws. In any event:

it was entirely within the Respondent’s power and responsibility to ensure that regulatory
formalities were observed in its privatization process. The Respondent has not identified any
public interest implicated by the timing of the publication.*”

523. Regarding the Respondent’s contention that Kutisay Mining OJSC failed to provide the
documentation required by law for the issuance of the Licenses, the Claimants note that Kutisay
Mining OJSC was a State-owned company, so the quality of its application was a matter within

1,880

the Respondent’s control,**’ and such failure would not have provided a basis for denying its

application.**

524. The Claimants assert that from the adoption of Resolution No 725, the whole process

of granting of the Licenses was carried out independently by the Respondent, while only illegal

882

conduct created by the Claimants could constitute a bar to jurisdiction.*** Otherwise, States could

easily infect an investment with latent illegalities to avoid responsibility for subsequent breaches
of international law.*** Thus, even if the illegality were to be established, the Claimants did not
take part in it and acquired Kutisay Mining OJSC by auction with the understanding, based on
the Respondent’s assurances, that Kutisay Mining OJSC properly held the Licenses.*** These
representations and the Respondent’s subsequent conduct granting subsequent License

Agreements are said to confirm the Claimants’ good faith belief that the transfer was legal.**

525. The Claimants argue that for these reasons their investments are protected under the

2003 Investment Law and they have the right to bring this dispute to international arbitration.**°

4. Whether the Claims Should Be Barred Because the Licenses Were Not Obtained in a
Genuine Auction, Contrary to Requirements of the Kyrgyz Civil Code

a. The Respondent’s Position

526. The Respondent alleges that Claimants took part in an auction while knowing in
advance that it would be rigged.**’ The auction process breached Articles 408 and 409 of the
Kyrgyz Civil Code, which require that there should have been at least two bidders in the auction.
In the present case the other bidder was not genuine. In addition, the auction should have been

advertised at least 30 days in advance, rather than only one week.***

527. The Respondent points out that Mr. Aryev testified at the Hearing that the Claimants’
local legal team took part in the auction.** In light of this testimony, the Respondent regards it as
“astonishing” that the Claimants, despite having allegedly retained legal advisers, did not verify

that the auction at which they acquired their purportedly most significant asset complied with

Kyrgyz law, and instead relied solely on undocumented assurances from individuals.*”°

528. The Respondent submits that knowledge of the requirements of the Kyrgyz Civil Code

must be imputed to the Claimants.**! In the circumstances of this case:

it is inconceivable that C[laimant]s did not check that the auction process, including the
notice requirement, was compliant in every respect. That C[laimant]s (allegedly being
advised by local lawyers) ignored the lateness of the notice when it posed a risk of invalidity
of the auction, can only mean that C[laimant]s took a calculated risk of accepting the Licenses
even though they knew that the auction process was irregular.*°”

529. The Respondent asserts that the lack of another bidder makes the auction unlawful. The
payment of the deposit “simply qualifies a participant to take part in the auction. However, it is
the actual participation in the auction, i.e. making a competing bid, which is relevant for

validity”.*

530. The Respondent argues that the Claimants conduct “before, during and subsequent to,
the auction, evidences that they knew at all those times that the auction was a sham and in breach
of law[.]”*™ In particular, the Respondent refers to the testimony of Mr. Aryev at the Hearing that
the “other company ” that participated in the auction “was not qualified to bid and ultimately did
not bid.”’*°> The Respondent also points out that the maximum bid authorised by Stans Energy
“was the exact amount that Stans Energy agreed with the corrupt members of the Bakiev regime
in exchange for the ‘bullet-proof’ scheme [and ...] there was no reason for Stans Energy to limit
the authorised maximum bid to such a ‘modest’ amount [...] unless Stans Energy knew that the

auction was rigged”.**° In any event, the Claimants’ knowledge is irrelevant for the question

whether there were breaches of Kyrgyz law.*°”

531. The Respondent argues that, contrary to Claimants’ “unevidenced assertion”, Kyrgyz

law does not allow the withdrawal of the shares during or after the bidding process if a desired

898

“reserve price” is not achieved at the auction.*”* In circumstances in which the starting price was

19 million soms and the bidding process was to last for an hour,’ the Respondent claims that
“unless C[laimant]s were certain that they were the only bidder, it defied the logic of any
bidding process to bid all the money the bidder had as its opening bid, as Stans KG did[.]”°
Furthermore, the Respondent alleges that Stans KG would have known from its broker in the
auction, Ak-Tilek Investment LLC (“Ak-Tilek”), that no one else was taking part in the

auction.°”' In such circumstances, the Respondent contends that:

it defied common sense to bid double the amount of the starting price [...] where there were
no other competitive bids, unless the sole intention of the auction was to give the appearance
of legitimacy for C[laimant]s’ payment of the amount unprovided for by law but requested

in secret by phone by Minister Kurmanaliev.°

sufficiently serious to justify dismissal of the claims and alleges that not only breaches of the law

which have “automatic nullifying requirements” operate as a bar to the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal.*” To exemplify this, the Respondent notes that corruption is recognized as a bar to
jurisdiction, although it does not automatically “nullify” an investment.°™ The Respondent also
contends that even if the Claimants did not actually know that the auction was unlawful, the
Tribunal still lacks jurisdiction and their claims are inadmissible as “ignorance of the law can

905

never excuse a party from the legal consequences of their actions.”*”’ Moreover, the Respondent

underscores the lack of evidence of the Claimants’ fulfilment of their duty to conduct legal due

diligence.°”

533. The Respondent also rejects the Claimants’ contention that the three-year limitation
period for an application for annulment of the auction had expired.’ According to the
Respondent, any mining company which may have had an interest in taking part in the auction
and was deprived of this opportunity due to the lack of proper advertisement qualifies as an
“interested party”.°°* As the Claimants acknowledge, it was difficult to obtain information
regarding the auction,°” and the Respondent alleges that “interested parties” are still to learn
about the violation of their rights (as such knowledge cannot be imputed to them for purposes of

Article 216(2) of the Kyrgyz Civil Code). The period of limitations to file an application to

invalidate the auction has yet to start running.°"”

affect the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.*”? In particular, the Claimants aver that only the Respondent
was in a position to produce evidence as to how the auction was organised and carried out.
However, the Respondent has not done so despite requests from the Claimants in the document
production phase.”"* In particular, the Claimants point out that the Respondent has not provided
its instructions to the CASE, the full auction report or any evidence “as to whether there was a
reserve price equivalent to the statutory tariff for Kutessay II and Kalesay, or some other
amount.”*'* The Claimants also consider that it would be disproportionate to deny jurisdiction

due to a “de minimis” violation of a local law, in which the Claimants did not take part.°!5

536. The Claimants aver that they were given assurances by individuals from different levels
of the Kyrgyz Government that the auction complied with local law.°!® According to the
Claimants, they could not have known that the notice given prior to the auction was insufficient
to satisfy Article 408 of the Kyrgyz Civil Code.°!’ Likewise, the Claimants assert that they did
not know until the Respondent’s Statement of Defence on the Merits and Memorial on
Jurisdiction how many bidders took part in the auction or what their qualifications were.°'* They
also note that the Respondent does not refer to any provision of the Kyrgyz Civil Code that would
disqualify Gremar SA, the “other bidder”.’'? According to the Claimants, Article 408(5) of the

breached Kyrgyz law, there would be no impact on jurisdiction because any violation would be
entirely the responsibility of the Respondent and “would be insufficiently serious in light of the
absence of any automatic nullifying effect under local law”.””?

538. Engaging with the disputed contention that the prior Government’s conduct cannot be
attributed to the Respondent today, the Claimants underscore that the Respondent had two years
after the change of regime before the statute of limitations expired in 2012, and it never took any
action to invalidate the auction.*”* The Claimants also deny that any would-be bidders would be
still unaware about the auction and could still seek to reverse the auction, as it was publicly

declared, investigated, and the subject of a complaint by the previous owner, CAMG.™*

recalls its Question 2:

2. Assuming that the Tribunal concludes that the 29 December 2009 auction at the Central
Asian Stock Exchange was contrary to Kyrgyz law, what is the evidence on the record that
the Claimants (i) were aware or (ii) could have been expected to be aware of such
unlawfulness? What would be the legal consequence if the auction was contrary to Kyrgyz
law but the Claimants were unaware of it?

territory of the Kyrgyz Republic.

2. In the event of a violation of Kyrgyz laws, investors shall be held liable in accordance
with Kyrgyz laws.°25

541. While it is clear that this provision is relevant for the substantive application of Kyrgyz
law, the Tribunal sees no indication from the text or a possible interpretation of the provision that
it excludes the jurisdiction provided for in Article 18 of the same Law irrespective of whether one
relies on one or the other of the slightly different English translations of Article 18 provided by
the Parties. Though Article 18 is very elaborate, it does not make any kind of exception to the
effect that the question of the observance of Kyrgyz law should not fall under the jurisdiction it

provides for investment disputes.

542. And the definition of “Investment Disputes” in Article 1(6) of the same Law provides
as follows:
“Investment dispute” means any dispute between an investor and government bodies,

officials of the Kyrgyz Republic and other participants of investment activity, arising in the
process of investment.”

Again, there is no indication in the text or a possible interpretation that violations of Kyrgyz law

should not be within the jurisdiction. Rather, the words “any dispute” suggest otherwise.

543. In view of these considerations, the Tribunal has no doubt that it has jurisdiction also
over alleged breaches of Kyrgyz law, to the extent relevant to decide an “Investment Dispute”
within the meaning of Article 18 of the 2003 Investment Law. The breaches of Kyrgyz law alleged
by Respondent will therefore be examined in the Tribunal’s consideration of the merits in so far

as considered relevant.

deliberate decision to withhold from the market, in breach of relevant Canadian disclosure
obligations for listed companies, and even from the CFO herself, AsiaRud’s conclusions which
advised that their Licenses were worthless.°**

545. According to the Respondent, the only plausible explanation for the suppression of
AsiaRud’s advice was “to justify an inflated claim for damages in these arbitral proceedings [...]
[t]his constitutes bad faith and the seeking of an unfair advantage in the pursuit of an international
remedy, and justifies the Tribunal dismissing the claims”.°”?

546. The Respondent initially indicates that, in the interests of procedural economy, it does
not contest jurisdiction or admissibility on this basis.°*° Nevertheless, in its Post-Hearing Brief
the Respondent asserts that the Claimants should be denied protection because they have “unclean

hands” and acquired their investments in bad faith.”?!

2. The Claimants’ Position

547. The Claimants aver that the claims were brought in good faith.°*? While accepting that
in certain limited circumstances an abuse of process could lead a tribunal to decline jurisdiction,
the Claimants contend that “[nJo tribunal has ever found that a claim for reparation or
compensation constitutes an abuse of process, regardless of its motivation”.°*? According to the
Claimants, the vindication of actual rights through arbitration cannot possibly occur in bad

faith.°**

548. The Claimants aver that recourse to arbitration was “not a convenient ‘early’ exit from
their projects” but a last resort after having attempted to obtain reinstatement of their rights
between 2012 and 2014.° Accordingly, the Respondent’s objection is without basis and should

be rejected.°*°

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

549. It is not clear to the Tribunal whether, in spite of its express withdrawal in paragraph
359 of its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction, the argument raised in the
Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, at para. 18, referring to the Kyrgyz Civil Code, Arts. 9(1) and
(3), is to be understood as a reintroduction or revival of its bad faith objection to jurisdiction.
Therefore, as a precaution, the Tribunal addresses this objection. The Tribunal concludes that it
does not see any grounds that the Claimants’ claims are outside its jurisdiction due to bad faith.
Should the bad faith allegation be considered as relevant on the merits, it will be considered later

in this Award.

MERITS

550. The Tribunal shall now turn to the merits of the Parties’ arguments. In essence, the
Claimants contend that the Respondent has unlawfully expropriated their investments without
paying any compensation, and has failed to provide them with fair and equitable treatment by
frustrating their legitimate expectations and acting arbitrarily. The Respondent denies the

breaches alleged by the Claimants.

WHETHER THE RESPONDENT UNLAWFULLY EXPROPRIATED THE CLAIMANTS’
INVESTMENTS

551. The Claimants assert that the Respondent has unlawfully expropriated their investments
through a series of measures that were later endorsed through the formal revocation of their
Licenses. The Claimants argue that such expropriation of their investments was unlawful, as it
breached rules of international law, the 2003 Investment Law and the Moscow Convention.®”
Conversely, the Respondent denies the existence of an expropriation and avers that the contested
measures were merely the consequence of the enforcement of Kyrgyz law in accordance with

proper legal procedure.

1. Whether the Respondent’s Termination of the Licenses Constituted an Expropriation
a. The Claimants’ Position

552. The Claimants assert that a series of cumulative and interconnected measures by the

Respondent “deprived the Claimants of the effective use and control of their investments”,
constituting an indirect de facto expropriation.*** They are accordingly entitled to compensation

pursuant to Article 6 of the 2003 Investment Law, which reads:

Article 6. Guarantees of Protection from Expropriation of Investments and
Compensation of Damages to Investors

1. Investments shall not be subject to expropriation (nationalization, requisition, or other
equivalent measures, including actions or omissions by the government bodies of the Kyrgyz
Republic resulting in forced withdrawal of investor’s funds or in depriving investor of an
opportunity to gain on the investments’ results), except as provided by Kyrgyz laws when
such expropriation is in the public interest and is carried out on a non-discriminatory basis
and pursuant to a proper legal procedure with the payment of timely, appropriate and
effective compensation of damages, including lost profit.

2. The amount of the compensation shall be equivalent to a fair market price of the
expropriated investment or part thereof, including lost profit, determined as of the date of the
expropriation decision. The fair market price must not reflect any change in the value of the
investment caused by having advance knowledge of the expropriation.

3. The compensation must be effectively realizable and shall be payable in a freely
convertible currency within the term agreed on by the parties. The compensation shall include
interest calculated in US Dollars at the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) for the term
for which the compensation is calculated. If such term is more than one year, a twelve-month
LIBOR shall be used.

4. A proper legal procedure means that investors shall have a right to prompt consideration
of the case based on the complaint about the impact of the expropriation, including the
evaluation of their investments and payment of compensation in accordance with the
provisions of this Article, by a judicial body or any other competent authority of the Kyrgyz
Republic without prejudice to the procedure for compensation of damages to investors
pursuant to Article 18 hereof.

5. The investors whose investments in the Kyrgyz Republic are impaired as a result of war
or any other armed conflict, revolution, state of emergency, civil collisions or other similar
circumstances, shall be granted the legal status and conditions as favorable as applied to legal
and physical persons of the Kyrgyz Republic. °°

553. According to the Claimants, these measures started with the adoption of the 26 June

2012 Resolution ordering the SAGMR to cancel the Kutessay II License Agreement No. 3 and to

re-tender both Licenses.“ According to the Claimants, it is “unnecessary to show that each and
every step in a creeping expropriation is an expropriatory act, or even has a perceptible
independent effect.”°*' The Claimants aver that, although that Resolution was subsequently
declared invalid, it reflects “an increasingly hostile and obstructive attitude by the Kyrgyz
authorities”.°? Furthermore, it is submitted that the conduct of the Respondent’s authorities
between June 2012 and October 2014 must be considered in the context of “the clear
expropriatory intent that was first made explicit in the 26 June 2012 Resolution”. This argues

“in favour of showing a measure to be expropriatory”.°

554. In response to the Respondent’s argument that SAGMR was entitled to revoke the
Licenses due to the Claimants’ failure to perform their obligations, the Claimants argue that it
was the Respondent, through SAGMR, who made performance of the License impossible.”
Kutisay Mining LLC was prevented from operating, which became a permanent situation
following the injunction issued on April 2013 at the request of the Prosecutor General.™° The
Claimants argue in this regard that the Respondent “misrepresents” Mr. Aryev’s testimony when
it suggests that he stated the contrary at the Hearing.” This injunction prohibited Kutisay Mining
LLC and anyone else from using, controlling, enjoying the benefits and disposing of the
investments, so the Claimants were “deprived of the economical use and enjoyment of its
investments”.°**

555. The Claimants argue that it is well-established that a decision of a judicial organ may
engage the international responsibility of a State and may amount to a taking of property.” The
injunction, in the Claimants’ view, constitutes the final step in the process of the indirect
expropriation of the Claimants’ investments.°*° These measures, individually and collectively,

allegedly deprived the Claimants of the effective use and control of the mining Licenses even

before the SAGMR formally confirmed their termination on 17 October 2014.°*' The SAGMR
decision extinguished without compensation the Claimants’ rights by definitely destroying their
legal title to the Licenses and “transforming the expropriation into an outright taking”.°* In this
regard, the Claimants point out that “tribunals have consistently held that it is possible to have ‘a
creeping expropriation plus an indirect expropriation before a direct expropriation[.]””*?

556. In sum, the Claimants argue that the acts and omissions of the Respondent and its
authorities in relation to their mining projects constitute an indirect de facto expropriation, which
was later judicially endorsed and implemented by the formal annulment and revocation of the
mining Licenses, amounting to a direct expropriation of their investments. These facts give rise
to a duty on the Respondent’s part to compensate the Claimants.°™*

557. The Claimants underscore that the Licenses were neither terminated on the ground that
Claimants had breached the License Agreements nor on the ground of allegations of corruption.°*°
According to the Claimants, whether the SAGMR or the courts could have terminated the
Licenses on these grounds is irrelevant, as these grounds were not alleged when the measures

were taken, and cannot accordingly justify their adoption. °*°

558. Furthermore, the Claimants consider that, while the Respondent’s authorities targeted
their mining Licenses, the expropriation of these Licenses also “entirely destroyed Claimants’
other investments”.°*’ In this regard, although Stans is still holding the title to 100% of the capital
in Kutisay Mining LLC through its wholly-owned subsidiary Stans KG, “this shareholding was

rendered entirely useless and has no economic value today”.°**

559. The Claimants point out that it has been recognized that measures affecting a corporate
entity can, under certain circumstances, “be considered tantamount to a de facto and indirect
expropriation of assets belonging to the corporation’s shareholders”.°* Since Kutisay Mining

LLC was deprived of all its principal assets, this direct expropriation not only reduced the value

of Stans’ shareholding in Kutisay Mining LLC but had the effect of “a deprivation and virtual

annihilation [on Stans’ shares] that constitutes expropriation”.°”

560. Finally, the Claimants deny that there cannot have been an expropriation unless the
Claimants can prove a denial of justice in the court proceedings that led to the termination of their
Licenses.**' This argument of the Respondent’s ignores, in the Claimants’ view, that they were
“depriv[ed] of an opportunity to present their case” in these court proceedings. Moreover, the
expropriation alleged by the Claimants was “creeping and indirect, beginning long before the

formal cancellation of the Claimants’ licenses”.**

b. The Respondent’s Position

561. The Respondent denies that its termination of the Claimants’ Licenses amounted to
indirect expropriation and considers it to be the consequence of the enforcement of Kyrgyz law
in accordance with proper legal procedure.*® Pursuant to the Kyrgyz courts’ decision that the
Licenses had been invalidly granted, the Licensing Commission terminated the Licenses under

Article 27(5) of the Subsoil Law.°™ Kutisay Mining LLC took part in the invalidation procedure

and also appealed the annulment decision before national courts.°®

562. The Respondent considers that the SAGMR was legally entitled to terminate the
Kutessay II License pursuant to Article 18 of the Subsoil Law (or alternatively, Article 27 of the
new version of the Subsoil Law dated 9 August 2012)°°° due to Kutisay Mining’s failure to submit
a Technical Plan approved by three Expert Reports by the deadline set forth in Kutessay II License
Agreement No. 3.°°” The Respondent considers that this entitlement to terminate the License is

unaffected under Kyrgyz law by Kutisay Mining LLC’s excuses for the breach (namely the 30-

day work suspension in September 2012 and the change in the National Park boundaries).
Moreover, the Respondent avers that the SAGMR was entitled to terminate the Kutessay II
License due to the Claimants’ failure to comply with Kutessay II License Agreement No. 2 and
that the “illegal” entry into a third license agreement did not impair this right.°

563. In relation to Kutessay II License Agreement No. 3, the Respondent alleges that it had
the right to terminate that License Agreement because Stans KG failed to agree to the free transfer
of an interest in Kutisay Mining LLC to the State by the established deadline.°” In this regard,
the Respondent considers that the condition was “plainly strict’ and “[t]here was no obligation
on the State Property Fund to agree to the transfer on any specific terms or at all. Neither was
there a promise on the part of the State Property Fund (or the Kyrgyz State) to so agree.”°”! In the

Respondent’s view, the State Property Fund could assess:

in its absolute discretion, whether such transfer was at all of interest, and if so, on what terms
[...] Kutessay LA 3 (or any other document on the record) did not limit the discretion of the
State Property Fund to decline to enter into such an agreement for whatever reason, or from
demanding that the interest be transferred on terms unacceptable to C[laimant]s, such as
obtaining 95% in the project.”

564. With respect to the Kalesay License Agreement No. 2, the Respondent asserts that it is
uncontested that Kutisay Mining failed to comply with its terms, including the failure to submit a
technical plan approved by three expert reports.° Thus, the Licenses “shall terminate” pursuant

to Articles 18(3) and (4) of the Subsoil Law.”

565. Having regard to the evidence presented at the Hearing, the Respondent takes the view
that “Mr Aryev (and Mr Shilov) unequivocally testif[ied] at the hearing that Kutisay breached the

license agreements.”°”

Moreover, the Claimants “do not even allege” that they satisfied the
requirements of the license agreements.°”° The Respondent also contests that either Mr. Aryev or

Mr. Shilov testified that the SAGMR agreed to vary the terms of the license agreement.”

566. The Respondent notes that where one clear basis exists to seek the invalidation of
Licenses, there is no requirement under Kyrgyz law or international law to pursue all possible

this Tribunal to act as an “appellate court” even though there is no authority for the Tribunal to

perform this function under either the 2003 Investment Law or international law,”*’ as investment

tribunals have consistently averred.°*! The Respondent clarifies that it does not argue that national
court decisions are immune from review by an international tribunal.” Rather, it asserts that
when an international tribunal is called to assess whether there has been a judicial expropriation

“it needs to consider whether the decision of the domestic court was “unlawful” in a relevant

sense”.*3

568. Relying on Azinian v. Mexico, the Respondent argues that the SAGMR invalidated the
Licenses on the basis of decisions from the national courts and, unless such decisions are
“disavowed” at the international level, the Respondent cannot be faulted for acting on that
basis.*** The Respondent submits that the Claimants have failed to prove how the actions of its
national courts could be regarded as “unlawful”;*** nor have they alleged a denial of justice,”
and even if the Respondent’s courts were “wrong” under Kyrgyz law (which the Respondent

denies), this would be insufficient to establish that the Licenses were expropriated.°*’ According

to the Respondent, domestic courts can terminate rights (both contractual and non-contractual)

without such termination amounting to expropriation.°**

569. Furthermore, according to the Respondent, the Claimants, “by making an omnibus
complaint of indirect expropriation”, have failed to address the circumstances in which a domestic
court decision might amount to expropriation. The Respondent considers that any interference

with the Claimants’ operations prior to the court proceedings had been minimal.**”

570. In this regard, the Respondent contends that the 26 June 2012 Resolution and the 30-
day suspension on which the Claimants rely were promptly invalidated by national courts, which
demonstrates their independence and willingness to find against the Government in appropriate
cases. ° These measures accordingly had no lasting impact, as demonstrated by

the 30-day suspension, Stans Energy’s market price was higher than it was immediately before
the 26 June 2012 Resolution.°? The Respondent asserts that the 26 June 2012 Resolution was
adopted in response to the Claimants’ numerous breaches of the Licenses Agreements, which is

relevant in assessing the nature of the measure.”

571. The Respondent also points out that the Claimants put forward “an unsubstantiated
allegation that the Kyrgyz government conspired with a Chinese mining company to terminate
the Licenses” so that they could be acquired by the latter.°°° The Respondent notes that the
Claimants have failed to provide any evidence of such conspiracy. Moreover, the Respondent

points out that, when the Chinese mining company in question initiated proceedings before

Kyrgyz courts, the Government intervened to oppose its claims. Finally, the Licenses have never

been issued to that company.””°

572. The Respondent argues that the 2003 Investment Law and international law exclude
from the definition of expropriation measures taken to enforce Kyrgyz law, as steps taken to
enforce national laws do not demonstrate expropriatory intent.’”’ The termination of the Licenses
was thus a consequence of the enforcement of Kyrgyz law, and not an expropriation.””*

573. The Respondent denies the Claimants’ contention that the injunction granted by the
Inter-district Court of Bishkek on 15 April 2013 constituted the final step in the process of indirect
expropriation. According to the Respondent, the injunction was a temporary measure, not
amounting to an expropriation.” It notes that, prior to that injunction, Kutisay Mining LLC had
failed to submit the TP, Expert Reports and TEA in time.'°° Accordingly, Kutisay Mining LLC
was in fundamental breach of the Kutessay II License Agreement No. 3 and was not entitled to

any extension or approvals. !°!

574. Moreover, the Respondent points out that, despite prior testimony to the contrary, !°?
Mr. Aryev confirmed at the Hearing that the injunction did not prevent Kutisay Mining LLC from
progressing with the work it was required to develop under its license agreement,'° which is

consistent with Stans Energy’s public statements. °°

575. Finally, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ characterization of the Respondent’s
conduct as a “creeping” expropriation. The Respondent argues, with reference to Burlington v.

separately constitutes expropriation”.'°°° In the present case, however, the Claimants also
contend that “the invalidation of the Licenses due to the courts’ decision amounted to a direct
expropriation.” !°° Moreover, according to the Respondent, the Claimants have failed to prove
“any link” between the initial steps of the purported creeping expropriation and the ultimate
invalidation of the Licenses.'°” Finally, the Claimants have not established that the measures

preceding the invalidation of the Licenses amounted to an indirect expropriation.

ce The Tribunal’s Analysis
576. At the outset, the Tribunal recalls Article 6(1) of the 2003 Investment Law:

Article 6. Guarantees of Protection from Expropriation of Investments and
Compensation of Damages to Investors

1. Investments shall not be subject to expropriation (nationalization, requisition, or other
equivalent measures, including actions or omissions by the government bodies of the Kyrgyz
Republic resulting in forced withdrawal of investor’s funds or in depriving investor of an
opportunity to gain on the investments’ results), except as provided by Kyrgyz laws when
such expropriation is in the public interest and is carried out on a non-discriminatory basis
and pursuant to a proper legal procedure with the payment of timely, appropriate and
effective compensation of damages, including lost profit.

577. Through the wording “measures, including actions or omissions by the government
bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic resulting in forced withdrawal of investor’s funds or in depriving
investor of an opportunity to gain on the investments’ results”, the provision provides a very wide

definition of the kind of dispossession falling under this Article.

578. The Tribunal has to examine first whether such a dispossession took place. Such an
examination is without prejudice for the later examination as to whether the dispossession was

lawful and at which time it occurred.

579. The Respondent does not deny that its authorities terminated the Claimants’ Licenses.
It only considers that this was done as a consequence of the enforcement of Kyrgyz law in

accordance with proper legal procedure and pursuant to the Kyrgyz courts’ decisions. In the view

of the Tribunal this latter allegation by the Respondent concerns the question whether the

termination was lawful, but does not suggest that there was no dispossession at all at any time.

580. For this conclusion, it is also irrelevant which of the disputed measures occurring at
different points in time were a dispossession. The Respondent’s measures, whether individually
or collectively, deprived the Claimants of the effective use and control of the mining Licenses at

least when the SAGMR formally decided their termination on 17 October 2014.

581. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that there was indeed a dispossession by the

Respondent, and Article 6(1) of the 2003 Investment Law is applicable.

2. Whether the Respondent’s Expropriation of the Claimants’ Investments was Lawful
a. The Claimants’ Position.
582. While the Claimants accept that the Respondent has the right to nationalize or

expropriate, they aver that it must do so in accordance with the requirements and conditions set
out under the relevant rules of international law and its domestic legislation. '°'°
583. The Claimants assert that it is uncontroversial that the conditions and limits on a State’s

101! and that these conditions

right to expropriate property are part of customary international law,
and limits are in turn reflected in Article 6 of the 2003 Investment Law.!°!* Likewise, the Moscow
Convention, which is also part of the Kyrgyz legal order, lays out comparable conditions for
expropriations of investments. !°'

584. The Claimants argue that the expropriation of their investments violated the conditions
set out under international law, the 2003 Investment Law and the Moscow Convention.!°'4 In
particular, they contend that the measures were arbitrary, did not further public interest and, in
any case, were not accompanied by “timely, appropriate and real” compensation. '°!5 The
Claimants regard as an “academic issue” the Respondent’s contention that Article 9 of the

Moscow Convention does not apply, allegedly because it only refers to “nationalisation” and

“requisitions”, rather than the allegedly broader concept of expropriation, “since it is undisputed

that Article 6 of the 2003 Investment Law and general international law impose the full range of

conditions on expropriation or measures having an equivalent effect”. !°"®

585. The Claimants aver that the indirect expropriation was not carried out in accordance

1017

with the procedures established within the Kyrgyz legal regime on expropriations,'’'’ as was

recognised by the Respondent’s judicial authorities with respect to the 26 June 2012 Resolution

and the SAGMR’s August 2012 order to stop work.'*!* They note that “creeping expropriations,

in practice, if not by definition, almost without exception prove to be unlawful”.!°'°

586. The Claimants consider that “the manoeuvres of the Respondent to eject Stans and to
reattribute the mining licenses to a different investor”, despite their efforts to perform their work

as planned, “are tainted by arbitrariness and lack of due process”.'° The Kyrgyz authorities’

conduct, according to the Claimants, demonstrates a “wilful disregard of due process of law”.!?!

The Claimants note that the sequence of acts “including the strong interest of a Chinese REE

company in Kutesay II, as well as the involvement of its associates within the Kyrgyz authorities

>> 1022

[...] indicate that the process of expropriation was arbitrary”.'°°* The Kyrgyz authorities first

encouraged an investment under a certain interpretation of the law and later challenged the

validity of the investment made. '

587. They Claimants also contend that the judicial proceedings initiated by the GPO against
the SAGMR “fail any test of judicial propriety. Kutisay Mining was not able to join the
proceedings as a full party [...] The Claimants were given no opportunity to present their case

[...] they were not entitled to appeal”.'°4

588. The Claimants contend that the arbitrary nature of the measures and their breach of
domestic law preclude any public interest justification. '”° In addition, the Claimants observe that
the Respondent’s authorities never invoked any public interest to justify the adoption of their
measures. !”° In particular, the Claimants point out that the Kyrgyz authorities did not identify
combating corruption as the basis for the adoption of any measures. The circumstances of the
alleged illegality, in turn, involved only entities within the Respondent’s control. In any event,
the measures “were disproportionate to the protection of any public interest”.!’ The taking of

mining licenses from a company that has effectively developed previously unproductive mines,

 

without any shortcomings in their operation, is by definition contrary to the public interest.'°7*
589. The Claimants point out that customary international law requires that an expropriation
be panied by prompt, adeq and effective 1,!°° an obligati ized in

 

 

the 2003 Investment Law and in the Moscow Convention.'°° Contrary to this obligation, the
Respondent has never offered any compensation. '' According to the Claimants, the
Respondent’s contention that it only bears an obligation to establish a procedure by which an
investor can seek compensation is incompatible with international law and Article 6 of the 2003
Investment Law. The need to apply for compensation cannot be reconciled with the requirement

of “promptness”. '°? The Claimants argue that, instead, the State should offer appropriate

compensation on its own initiative. '°?

590. The Claimants assert that the lack of compensation is even more difficult to understand
as the Respondent’s authorities justified the termination of the Licenses by reference to alleged

illegalities to which such authorities were the only parties.'°* The Claimants consider that the

lack of any offer of compensation “renders this expropriation unlawful per se”.'°°5

b. The Respondent’s Position

591. The Respondent argues that, even if the measures it took could be characterised as an
expropriation (which it denies), the requirements laid out by Article 6 of the 2003 Investment
Law were fulfilled, namely the expropriation was (1) provided for by Kyrgyz law, (2) in the public
interest, (3) carried out on a non-discriminatory basis and (4) carried out pursuant to proper legal

procedure. '*

592. With regard to the first point, the Respondent avers that Article 27(5) of the Subsoil
Law was the legal basis for the termination of the Licenses and that, even if there had been an
incorrect application of Kyrgyz law, it is not for this Tribunal to substitute its views for that of
the Respondent’s courts. '°7

593. With regard to the public interest requirement, in the Respondent’s view, the fact that
the SAGMR decision to terminate the Licenses was taken to enforce compliance with the Subsoil
Law suffices to demonstrate that it was taken in the public interest, as States have a public interest
in the enforcement of their laws.'°** Indeed, the SAGMR was legally obliged to terminate the
Licenses because the Claimants had failed to effectively develop the deposits and failed to provide
basic documentation, in breach of the fundamental requirements of their Licenses. '° The
Respondent denies that the concept of proportionality plays any role in assessing whether the
measures were taken in the public interest, as this case merely concerns the enforcement of pre-
existing laws. '“ In addition, the Respondent, relying on several international investment treaty
decisions, submits that States have discretion to decide whether a particular action is in their

public interest.!°!

594. With regard to the non-discrimination requirement, the Respondent asserts that the

Claimants have not demonstrated that they suffered any discriminatory treatment with regard to

similarly placed mining license holders, since many other mining licenses were also cancelled.'*
1043

In any event, the Claimants’ complaints of arbitrariness are without foundation.
595. Finally, the decision to terminate the Licenses was taken “pursuant to proper legal
procedure”, as required by Article 6(1) of the 2003 Investment Law. Kutisay Mining LLC
exercised its right to appeal such decision before the Respondent’s courts.' Likewise, the court
decisions which were the basis for the invalidation of the Licenses were the result of a “proper
legal procedure”.'°*° The Respondent contends that the formal status of Kutisay Mining LLC as
a defendant or a third party in the proceedings is a question of Kyrgyz procedural law and is
irrelevant because due process requirements were met. In this regard, the Respondent underscores
that the Claimants have not alleged to have suffered a denial of justice.“ The Respondent rejects
the Claimants’ argument that they were not entitled to any appeal, noting that they did in fact
appeal and “the judgment also records that Kutisay’s arguments were considered and rejected by

the Appellate Instance of the Bishkek City Court”.!°47

596. With regard to compensation, the Respondent contends that if Article 6(1) is read in
conjunction with Article 6(4) of the 2003 Investment Law, it becomes clear that it is not
incumbent upon the Kyrgyz Republic to offer compensation to an investor for the expropriation

of its investment. Rather, the investor has the right to a proper legal procedure by which it can

1048,

seek compensation.'”* In the Respondent’s view, it cannot be held responsible for the Claimants’

failure to apply to Kyrgyz courts for compensation.'™” In sum, the fact that the Claimants have
not been compensated would not render the expropriation unlawful under Article 6 of the 2003
Investment Law. '°° Likewise, the Respondent submits that under customary international law the

failure to provide compensation does not render what would otherwise be a lawful expropriation

in the same manner as a lawful expropriation” .\°

597. The Respondent, finally, reiterates that the Claimants are not entitled to bring a claim
under the Moscow Convention because (1) the 2003 Investment Law does not provide a
jurisdictional basis for such claim and (2) they are not “investors” within the meaning of the
Moscow Convention. '*% In any event, the Respondent has not breached Article 9 of that
Convention because there has been neither a “requisition” nor a “nationalisation”. Article 9 of the
Moscow Convention does not prohibit measures having an equivalent effect to a “requisition” or

a “nationalisation” .!°*4

ce The Tribunal’s Analysis

598. Regarding the 26 June 2012 Resolution and the SAGMR’s August 2012 order to stop
work, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent contends that the 26 June 2012 Resolution was not
implemented and is irrelevant to the ultimate termination of the Licenses. '°* In support of this
contention, the Respondent argues that the 26 June 2012 Resolution was not binding, the SAGMR
actually did not follow it, and it was ultimately invalidated by Kyrgyz courts.'°° Since the
Respondent does not rely on these as a justification for the lawfulness of the dispossession and,
indeed, the Claimants continued their work thereafter, the Tribunal need not examine the effects

of these.

599. For similar reasons, the Tribunal need not examine whether the suspension order of 30
August 2012 constituted a dispossession, because, after the suspension order expired on 30
September 2012, Stans Energy resumed its work on the Kutessay II project and announced that it

had produced dysprosium, terbium and gadolinium metals at the KRP.'°%7

600. The Tribunal now turns to the SAGMR’s decision of 17 October 2014, '°°* by which
the SAGMR’s Subsoil Use Licensing Commission decided to terminate Kutisay Mining LLC’s
Licenses, referring to the decisions of the Kyrgyz courts in favour of the GPO.'° Kutisay Mining
LLC filed its claim with the Inter-District Court of Bishkek seeking invalidation of the 17 October
2014 Minutes.'° On 8 December 2014, the Inter-District Court of Bishkek dismissed this claim,
referring to the court decisions of 19 March 2014 and 30 July 2014 which invalidated the 21
December 2009 Minutes.'°°! The Bishkek City Court and the Supreme Court of Kyrgyzstan
averred this decision on 27 January 2015 and 15 October 2015, respectively. !°

601. As described above, in the Summary of Facts, the reason for the revocation of the
Claimants’ Licenses was the GPO’s finding that the issuance of the Licenses without tender was
illegal under Kyrgyz law—a finding that was subsequently confirmed by the Kyrgyz courts. As
noted above, the Supreme Court notably concluded that the attribution of the Licenses “through
direct negotiations, as indicated in the Minutes No. 1736-H-09 dated 21 December 2009”, “had
violated the law in force in the Kyrgyz Republic”.!° Given the invalidation of the 21 December
2009 Minutes on these grounds, the SAGMR resolved to terminate the Licenses acquired by the

Claimants.

602. Here, the Tribunal will address the Respondent’s arguments that the Licenses were
granted to the Claimants in breach of Kyrgyz law. Above, the Tribunal has already found that this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction is not affected by these allegations. The following examination thus only

refers to the merits.

603. Also above, the Tribunal has already found that the Respondent, which has the burden

of proof, has not provided sufficient evidence that the Claimants obtained the Licenses through

corruption. For the same reasons, which need not to be repeated here, no participation in or

awareness of money laundering by the Claimants has been proved.

604. While, in the present proceedings, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants did not
fulfil certain obligations which they had under the Licenses, the SAGMR’s decision of 17 October
2014 and the decisions of the Kyrgyz courts in favour of the GPO to which it refers do not mention
these allegations, but focus on what the Respondent alleges was a breach of the tender
requirements of the Subsoil Law which is argued to prevent the Claimants from having obtained
a valid licence. Article 16 of the Subsoil Law (using Respondent’s translation) provides as

follows:

Article 16. Procedure for Granting Subsoil Use Rights
Subsoil use rights shall be granted by holding tenders and direct negotiations.

Tenders shall be announced and held for gold ore, oil, gas and other sites of national
significance by decision of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. The terms and
conditions of the tender and the winning bidder shall be determined by the tender committee
of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to be appointed for each particular site.

Subsoil use rights by way of direct negotiations shall be granted on application by natural
persons and legal entities by the state subsoil use authority to be determined by the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. The application must contain information about the
applicant, and the location and type of subsoil use. The following documents shall be annexed
to the application:

- copies of the constitutive documents and charter for legal entities, or registration
documents for natural persons;

- geological survey or development project or project of construction and operation of
underground structures not connected with the extraction of minerals at the site in question,
with consolidated technical and economic assessment of capital investments, operating
expenses, revenues and project profitability;

- statement of availability of financing for the works envisaged at the subsoil site in question
pursuant to the submitted development project. [...]!

605. The first sentence clarifies that there are two methods to grant subsoil rights: tenders
and direct negotiations. The wording “other sites of national significance by decision of the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic”, particularly by the inclusion of the word “other” indicates

that a tender is only mandatory if the respective site has been put on the list of sites of national

significance. Accordingly, the Government had the authority to decide whether a tender was

required or the option of direct negotiations should be used for certain sites.

606. On 1 December 2009, the Kyrgyz Government issued Resolution No 725, which
permitted the Ministry of Natural Resources to issue mining licenses without a tender to entities
wholly managed by the Development Fund, for subsequent sale of these entities by auction at
stock exchange. As is undisputed, Stans Energy obtained the Kutessay II and Kalesay Licenses

without a tender procedure, by purchasing Kutisay Mining OJSC.

607. The legal effect under Kyrgyz law of the decisions of the Kyrgyz courts in favour of
the GPO, to which SAGMR’s decision of 17 October 2014 refers, stating the invalidity of the 21
December 2009 Minutes is not fully clear to the Tribunal. The 17 October 2014 Minutes deemed
the subsoil use rights under the Licenses terminated “pursuant to Article 27, Part 5, of the Kyrgyz
Republic Law ‘On Subsoil’,”!°° which reads: “[t]ermination of subsoil use rights shall be
effected by the decision of the government body responsible for implementation of the state policy
on subsoil use. From the date of entry into force of a judicial act invalidating the decision to award
a subsoil use right, such right shall be deemed terminated.”!°° From this language, at least in its
English translation, it seems not clear whether the 21 December 2009 Minutes were invalidated

ex tunc or ex nunc.

608. What can certainly be said is that the Kyrgyz government changed its position in respect
of the legality of the acquisition of the Licenses by the Claimants. Clearly, when the SAGMR
signed the 21 December 2009 Minutes and on occasions thereafter, the Government assumed that

the acquisition of the Licenses was lawful.

609. In the present context, the Tribunal only has to examine the relevance of this process
for making the dispossession of the Claimants’ investments lawful under Article 6 of the 2003
Investment Law, irrespective of any further implications within the internal jurisdiction of
Kyrgyzstan. In this respect, the Tribunal takes into account the following: it has not been shown

that the Claimants as foreign investors knew or at least by due diligence should have known that

Resolution No 725 was invalid. The Claimants correctly contend that the Kyrgyz Republic later
ratified the transaction. Indeed, when Kutisay Mining OJSC was reorganized as Kutisay Mining
LLC, the Kyrgyz Government re-issued the Licenses in accordance with Kyrgyz law. This process
was an opportunity for the Respondent to re-consider the legality of the Licenses and the
transaction underlying them, however the Government failed to point out any concern over the

Licenses and re-issued them.

610. Therefore, not only could the Claimants trust that the Licenses were granted in
accordance with Kyrgyz law, but the Respondent continued to cooperate with the Claimants while

they continued with their investment and even confirmed this by re-issuing the Licenses.

6ll. The termination by the SAGMR and the courts of the Licenses cannot therefore be

considered as making the dispossession lawful under Article 6 of the 2003 Investment Law.

612. Finally, Article 6(1) of the 2003 Investment Law expressly requires that the
dispossession be “pursuant to a proper legal procedure with the payment of timely, appropriate

and effective compensation of damages, including lost profit.”!%7

613. As no compensation has been offered by the Respondent, this being a mandatory
requirement to make a dispossession lawful, there is no need for the Tribunal to examine whether
the other requirements mentioned in Article 6(1) that it “is in the public interest and is carried out

71068

on a non-discriminatory basis’ are complied with.

614. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the Respondent has breached Article 6(1) of the

2003 Investment Law by an unlawful dispossession, and is liable accordingly.

615. The Tribunal adds that it has reached this conclusion without recourse to any new legal
concepts or evidence allegedly submitted by the Claimants for the first time with their Reply Post-
Hearing Brief (see paras 150 and 151 above). In particular, the Tribunal does not consider the
notion of estoppel, argued by the Claimants in that submission, to be relevant here. Accordingly,
the Tribunal has decided not to take into account the portions of the Claimants’ Reply Post-

Hearing Brief and the accompanying legal authorities to which the Respondent has objected.

WHETHER THE RESPONDENT FAILED TO ACCORD TREATMENT AS REQUIRED BY ARTICLE 4
OF THE 2003 INVESTMENT LAW

616. The Claimants also contend that the Respondent has failed to accord them fair and
equitable treatment by breaching their legitimate expectations and by acting arbitrarily. The
Respondent denies that, under the applicable law, it is required to accord fair and equitable

treatment to the Claimants.

1. ‘Whether the Respondent Was Required to Accord Fair and Equitable Treatment to
the Claimants

a. The Claimants’ Position

617. The Claimants assert that the Respondent was required to accord them fair and equitable
treatment.'°® They note that Article 4 of the 2003 Investment Law details different elements

characteristic of fair and equitable treatment, in that the Kyrgyz Republic has undertaken:

to provide foreign investors with “the national treatment in the sphere of economic activity”,
to not permit discrimination, and to “refrain from interfering in economic activity, rights and
legal interests of investors, except as provided by Kyrgyz laws”.9”

618. According to the Claimants, Article 4 implements the fair and equitable treatment
standard within the 2003 Investment Law.'' They consider that this is confirmed by the
Preamble which, despite not creating self-standing legal obligations, is part of the statutory
context and lays out that its provisions are aimed at “improving the investment climate in the
[Kyrgyz] [R]epublic and promoting the flow of local and foreign investment by providing

investors with a fair and equitable legal regime [...]”.!°

619. Claimants also contend that by enacting the 2010 Investment Protection Decree, the
Respondent assumed and reiterated to the international community its obligation to provide fair
and equitable treatment to foreign investors. '°? They define this decree as a unilateral

undertaking of the Respondent which creates independent legal obligations binding it as a matter

of international law.'° The Claimants regard it as an authoritative interpretation of the 2003

Investment Law; its paragraph 3 expressly confirms that such law imposes on the Respondent the

obligation to treat foreign investors fairly and equitably: !°

Pursuant to the Kyrgyz Law “On investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”, foreign and domestic
investors shall be guaranteed, and shall continue to enjoy, a fair and equitable legal regime,
including guarantees of protection of their investments made into the economy of the Kyrgyz
Republic. 197

620. The Claimants also point to Article 8 of the Moscow Convention, which contains broad

obligations for the Resp such as the to provide to i within its territory

“unconditional legal protection to be secured by this Convention, the national legislation of the

Parties as well as international treaties (agreements) [...]”.!°"”

621. The Claimants assert that the fair and equitable treatment standard is part of general
international law, regardless of whether it is referred to as the “international minimum standard”
of protection or the fair and equitable treatment standard.'°* As general international law, it is
part of the Respondent’s legal system and, as such, remains applicable in this case because the
Respondent cannot “pick and choose through legislation some of its obligations under

international law, disavowing others”.'°”

b. The Respondent’s Position

622. The Respondent argues that, assuming that the Claimants satisfy the jurisdictional
requirements, they would only be entitled to bring claims for breaches of the 2003 Investment
Law, and not claims for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard,” for which the

Claimants have not identified any applicable normative source. The Respondent notes that such

standard is not amongst the substantive provisions of the 2003 Investment Law. '°! The

Respondent emphasizes:

There is a distinction between the scope of a State’s international obligations and the
remedies which an investor is entitled to pursue under a particular investment instrument [...]
This is not a question of a State “picking and choosing” some of its obligations, as the
Claimants suggest. It is a common feature in investment treaties that an investor will only be
entitled to bring certain claims [...] Indeed, the default situation is that, absent an applicable
investment instrument, no international proceedings can be pursued by an aggrieved foreign
investor. !°%

623. The Respondent argues that the 2003 Investment Law does not allow a covered investor
to bring a claim on the basis of the fair and equitable treatment standard as this standard is not
expressly provided for in the Law.'°*

624. The Respondent notes that Article 4 of the 2003 Investment Law provides for various
protections to covered investors, namely (1) national treatment; (2) non-discrimination when
granting investment rights; and (3) non-interference with rights and interests of investors except
as provided for by Kyrgyz law.'°“* While the Claimants argue that this provision details different
elements of the fair and equitable treatment standard, the Respondent contends that the express
enumeration of each of these protections means that a covered investor cannot bring a claim for

a broader fair and equitable treatment standard.'°*°

625. The Respondent avers that the 2003 Investment Law should be interpreted by looking
at its literal meaning. If the Law is interpreted literally, it is apparent that reference to the fair and

equitable treatment standard is absent. !°*° The Respondent denies that the reference in the

Preamble to a “fair and equitable regime” may create any free-standing obligation. '°”

626. The Respondent also rejects the Claimants’ argument that it has reiterated and assumed

the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment through the 2010 Investment Protection

Decree. '*** The Respondent notes that the Claimants do not point to any other instrument in which
the Respondent would have assumed any such obligation that could have been “reiterated”. !°
Rather, the Decree merely reaffirms the continued application of the 2003 Investment Law, which
does not contain such standard of protection.'° The Respondent denies that the 2010 Decree
amounts to a unilateral declaration. Even if it did, however, it would have to be interpreted
restrictively pursuant to Article 7 of the ILC Guiding Principles.'' Thus, had the Respondent
wished to make a unilateral declaration providing for the applicability of the fair and equitable

treatment standard, it would have used clear words to that effect.'? The 2010 Decree does not

contain any “clear and specific 1093

assumption of new obligations.

627. The Respondent reiterates its position to the effect that covered investors under the 2003

Investment Law may only bring claims for breaches of that Law and cannot file a claim for breach

1094 1095

of customary international law'°”* or the Moscow Convention.'°”° Even assuming that this were

possible, however, neither of the Claimants could have filed such a claim because (1) customary
international law on investment protection only applies to foreign investors, a condition not
fulfilled by Kutisay Mining LLC; and (2) customary international law bars claims by shareholders

for damage suffered by a company in which it hold shares, such that claims by Stans Energy

would be precluded. '°°

628. Finally, the Respondent considers that the Claimants misstate the contents of the
customary international law rules on the treatment of aliens.'°”’ The Respondent contests that the

fair equitable treatment standard can be equated with the customary international law minimum

standard.

ce The Tribunal’s Analysis
629. Article 4(4) of the 2003 Investment Law provides:

The Kyrgyz Republic through its authorized government bodies, officials and municipal
governance bodies shall refrain from interfering in economic activity, rights and legal
interests of investors, except as provided by Kyrgyz laws.!

630. The Parties dispute whether this provision, perhaps together with the Preamble of the
2003 Investment Law, provides an obligation for the Respondent to grant Fair and Equitable
Treatment (“FET”) to the Claimants as is provided expressly in many investment treaties. The
Tribunal considers that it does not have to enter into that debate, but should rather examine

whether this quoted provision of Article 4(4), as it stands, has been breached.

631. In this context, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that for the interpretation of
Article 4(4) of the 2003 Investment Law it is relevant that the new Government of the Republic
1100

issued the 2010 Investment Protection Decree''”’ which expressly provided in its Section 3:

Pursuant to the Kyrgyz Law “On investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”, foreign and domestic
investors shall be guaranteed, and shall continue to enjoy, a fair and equitable legal regime,
including guarantees of protection of their investments made into the economy of the Kyrgyz
Republic. 2°!

632. The Tribunal does not have to decide whether the words “a fair and equitable legal
regime” have to be interpreted as identical with the FET-standard found in investment treaties.
But the express reference to “the Kyrgyz Law ‘On investments in the Kyrgyz Republic” makes
it clear that this is indeed an authoritative interpretation by the Government which is relevant for

the interpretation of Article 4(4) of the 2003 Investment Law.

i. The Claimants’ Position

633. The Claimants argue that the Respondent has failed to respect the fair and equitable
treatment standard by frustrating the Claimants’ legitimate expectations and by acting

arbitrarily. !!?

634. The Claimants provide an overview of what they regard as the relevant case-law
regarding the content and scope of the fair and equitable treatment standard.''°> According to the
Claimants, the concept of legitimate expectations has been described as the “dominant element”
of the fair and equitable treatment standard,'' and a “stable and predictable environment in

accordance with the investor’s legitimate expectations” is required. !'°°

635. The Claimants’ legitimate expectations in the present case are derived not only from
the law in force in the Kyrgyz Republic when they acquired Kutisay Mining OJSC but also from

over a period of three years no official or authority disputed the validity of the Licenses.!!'!

According to the Claimants, the change in the attitude of the Kyrgyz authorities in 2013, when
the legality of previous administrative acts carried by the government was questioned, “was
arbitrary and contrary to elementary principles of good faith [...] entirely frustrated Claimants’
legitimate expectations”.'!!

636. Furthermore, the Claimants contest the Respondent’s position during the Hearing to the
effect that the verbal character of the assurances would prevent them from “form[ing] the basis
for legitimate expectations and a claim of unfair treatment for the purposes of international
law.” ''!3 According to the Claimants, there is no prescribed form for assurances under
international law.'''4 In support of their position, the Claimants invoke the decision in Pezold v.
Zimbabwe, where the tribunal upheld a claim for breach of the FET standard and determined that
the Claimants’ legitimate expectations “could be based on encouragement from civil servants and

verbal assurances from ministers.”!!!°

637. The Claimants further aver that, while this would suffice to find a violation of the fair
and equitable treatment standard insofar as no proof of bad faith is required, the authorities also
“acted in manifest bad faith [...] took positions hostile to Stans [...] apparently driven by

individuals who had close contacts with the new potential investor”. !!'°

ii. |The Respondent’s Position

638. The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ contention that it frustrated a legitimate
expectation in “the validity and legality of the licenses”.''” It is clear from the circumstances in
which Stans Energy acquired Kutisay Mining OJSC that the Claimants “could have had no

legitimate expectation that the Kyrgyz government would not seek to enforce the terms of the

by reason of an investor being subject to national law, properly applied by national courts.”!!!°

639. The Respondent considers that it was not reasonable for the Claimants to rely on any of
the representations allegedly made by Mr. Eliseev in this regard, given the factual circumstances
and numerous red flags which should have alerted the Claimants to corruption.'!”° As a result
such representations could not give rise to any legitimate expectations.'!?' The Respondent notes
that Mr. Aryev testified at the Hearing that the Claimants did not rely on any assurance given by

Mr. Eliseev.!!??

640. The Respondent argues that the relevant time for assessing the expectations of the
Claimants is the time when the investment was made.''?? According to the Respondent, provisions
of general legislation do not create a legitimate expectation as they are not specific enough to
justify reliance.''”4 In any event, as noted above, Stans KG acquired its shares in Kutisay Mining
OJSC on 29 December 2009; Resolution No 725 however entered into force only on 9 January
2010. Accordingly, the 21 December 2009 Minutes could not have provided a basis for any
expectations when the investment was made.'!?> Rather, the Respondent points out that when the
Claimants acquired their investment, the legal framework in force provided for a tender
procedure. In order to be granted valid rights to the deposits, investors had to observe Kyrgyz
laws when developing economic activity, and were subject to enforcement procedures under
Kyrgyz law.'!”° Accordingly, the Claimants could have had no legitimate expectation that they
would be exempt from the tender requirement under the Subsoil Law or that they would not be
subject to enforcement procedures.'!”’ The Respondent also points out that Mr. Aryev testified at
the Hearing that the Claimants did not receive specific assurances in relation to the lawfulness of

the allocation of the Licenses before he left Bishkek,''?* nor subsequently. |!”

641. The Respondent submits that the Claimants’ suggestion that its conduct must be
assessed by reference to the 26 June 2012 Resolution is misconceived, inter alia, because the
basis on which the Licenses were ultimately terminated was completely unrelated to the basis for

termination which the 26 June 2012 Resolution had recommended.'!*°

642. The Respondent denies that any potential delay that may have occurred in invalidating
the Licenses was relevant to the reasonableness of the Claimants’ expectations, as such
expectations must be assessed at the time the investment was made and subsequent events are
irrelevant.''*! There was no change of position by the Respondent which could have violated the

fair and equitable treatment standard or the international minimum standard. !!*?

643. The Respondent also contests the Claimants’ reliance on Pezold v. Zimbabwe, for the
proposition that legitimate expectations “could be based on encouragement from civil servants
and verbal assurances from ministers.”''** The Respondent points out that, in that case, specific
written and oral assurances were made over a period for 25 years, while in the present case any
alleged verbal assurances “remain elusive, unproven and contradicted by Mr Aryev’s own
testimony.” ''*+ Moreover, the Claimants failed to prove their reliance on any purported

assurances. '!*5

644. In sum, even if the Claimants were entitled to bring a claim for breach of the fair and

equitable treatment standard, such claim should be dismissed.''*

iii. | The Tribunal’s Analysis

645. In view of its above considerations, the Tribunal does not have to enter into the Parties’
dispute whether the standard of legitimate expectations as it is used to interpret the FET standard
in investment treaties has been breached in the present case. Rather, the Tribunal will examine

whether the Respondent accorded to the Claimants the treatment expressly required by Article

4(4) of the 2003 Investment Law as clarified by the above quoted interpretation in Section 3 of

the Government’s 2010 Investment Protection Decree.

646. Above, in its examination of a breach of Article 6 of the 2003 Investment Law, the
Tribunal has found that not only could the Claimants trust that the Licenses were granted in
accordance with Kyrgyz law as the entire process was organized and controlled by the
Respondent, but the Respondent continued cooperating with the Claimants while they continued
with their investment and the Respondent even confirmed this by re-issuing the Licenses. In these
circumstances termination by the SAGMR of the Licenses, based on the invalidation by the courts
of the 21 December 2009 Minutes, in the view of the Tribunal, was not consistent with the promise
of “a fair and equitable legal regime, including guarantees of protection of their investments”
according to the Government’s own interpretation of the 2003 Investment Law, and was therefore

a breach of Article 4(4) of the 2003 Investment Law.

647. In view of this conclusion, the Tribunal does not have to enter into the detailed
discussion between the Parties whether any particular individual steps in the implementation of

the Licenses were justified or not.

b. | Whether the Respondent Acted Arbitrarily

648. The Claimants assert that investment tribunals have held consistently that arbitrary or

discriminatory conduct is per se a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.!'*”

649. According to the Claimants, the Respondent has acted arbitrarily towards them and their
investments in “wilful disregard of due process of law and juridical propriety”.''* In particular,
the Claimants allege that, after sustained and coherent conduct recognizing the validity and
legality of the mining Licenses granted to the Claimants, the Respondent’s authorities later
reversed their position arbitrarily and in bad faith in order to replace the Claimants with a new

investor “for political and commercial reasons”.'!*° Relying on the decision in Belokon v. Kyrgyz

Republic, they deny that the fact that the measures were taken to comply with local law could

alter this conclusion.!'*°

650. According to the Claimants, the arbitrariness of the Respondent’s conduct is
underscored by the exclusion of Kutisay Mining LLC as a party in the proceedings before the
Kyrgyz courts, which allowed “the prosecutor and the SAGMR to collude in the disposal of the

9 1141

matter to the State’s benefit’ and left them without standing to appeal the court’s decision, in

1142

breach of due process. In this regard, they invoke Belokon v. Kyrgyz Republic, where the

tribunal found that the respondent had violated the fair and equitable treatment standard by

“be[ing] able to seize control of a foreign investment and provid[ing] no remedy for access to the

courts to challenge that seizure”.''3

651. In sum, the Claimants assert that the Respondent, acting arbitrarily and in bad faith, has

frustrated the Claimants’ legitimate expectations and destroyed their investments, thereby

breaching its obligation to treat them and their investments fairly and equitably.''

ii. |The Respondent’s Position

652. The Respondent argues that it did not act arbitrarily and states that the two complaints

put forward by the Claimants in this regard are without merit.!!°

653. First, the Respondent denies that it has arbitrarily changed its position regarding the
legality of the granting of Licenses to Kutisay.''° States are entitled to change their position when
they become aware of new facts, and the Respondent argues that it cannot be faulted for seeking

to enforce the Subsoil Law once it had become aware of breaches of this Law by allegedly corrupt

aware of the illegality.
654. Second, the Claimants allege that they were precluded from opposing the injunction
ordered by the Inter-District Court of Bishkek—a complaint which the Respondent qualifies as
“simply misguided” because Kutisay did in fact challenge the injunction.''* The Respondent
avers that the mere fact that its challenge was unsuccessful does not evidence any arbitrary
conduct.'!? The Respondent argues that if the Claimants had any complaint about the conduct of
Kyrgyz national courts, this would be a denial of justice claim. Such a claim would be subject to
a different standard and to the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies. However, the
Claimants do not argue denial of justice in the present case.''*°

655. In sum, the Respondent denies that its conduct was arbitrary. It also argues that any
“interference” with the Claimants’ economic activity was in accordance with Kyrgyz law, and
they had an opportunity to present their case. ''*' Moreover, even if a particular act were
considered arbitrary, the Claimants would still need to establish that such particular arbitrary

conduct caused them loss or damage in order to recover any damages. '!*

 

The Tribunal’s Analysis

656. In view of its conclusions above that both Article 6 and Article 4(4) of the 2003
Investment Law were breached by the Respondent, the Tribunal does not have to examine whether
a breach additionally occurred due to the Respondent acting arbitrarily, as neither Party requests

any other or additional relief on the basis of such a further breach.

by which damages are to be assessed is discussed. Second, the Parties’ positions as to the date by

reference to which damages are to be calculated are set out. Finally, the Parties’ views regarding
the appropriate valuation methodology to calculate the damages suffered by the Claimants as well

as their quantification are discussed.

LEGAL STANDARD

658. According to the Claimants, the compensation due must be determined in accordance
with general international law, which provides for the principle of full reparation. In contrast, the
Respondent argues that any damages should be calculated in accordance with Article 6(2) of the

2003 Investment Law.
659. Article 6(2) of the 2003 Investment Law provides:

2. The amount of the compensation shall be equivalent to a fair market price of the
expropriated investment or part thereof, including lost profit, determined as of the date of the
expropriation decision. The fair market price must not reflect any change in the value of the
investment caused by having advance knowledge of the expropriation."'5*

  

1. The Claimants’ Position

660. The Claimants examine Article 6(2) of the 2003 Investment Law and note that it does
not contain an express stipulation regarding the meaning of “fair market value”, nor does it set
out a compensation formula for unlawful acts and omissions (including unlawful expropriations
or breaches of the fair and equitable treatment obligation).'' In any event, they argue that
Article 6(2) prescribes full reparation. !!°

661. The Claimants argue that, in the absence of any /ex specialis, compensation for the
unlawful expropriation of their investment must be determined in accordance with the general
international law principle of “full reparation”.''*° This principle applies to all the internationally

wrongful acts committed by the Respondent.'!*”

662. The Claimants refer to the principle of full reparation enunciated by the Permanent
Court of International Justice in the Chorzéw Factory judgement to the effect that “reparation
must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the
situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed”.'!*
Accordingly, the Tribunal’s award should place the Claimants in the economic position in which
they would have been had the internationally wrongful act not occurred.''? The amount of
compensation to be paid should be assessed on the basis of the diminution in the fair market value

of the Claimants’ investment resulting from the Respondent’s wrongful conduct.'!©

663. The Claimants contend that, even if it were difficult to quantify the precise value of the

losses they sustained, as the Respondent argues, “it is beyond doubt that the Claimants lost them”.

In other words, the fact that the Claimants incurred losses is “real and certain”.!'°!

2. The Respondent’s Position

664. The Respondent asserts that, should the Tribunal find that the Respondent has
expropriated the Claimants’ investment, any damages should be calculated in accordance with

Article 6(2) of the 2003 Investment Law.!!

665. The Respondent contests the Claimants’ suggestion that the Tribunal should resort to
general international law, asserting that it rests on erroneous assumptions concerning (1) the
claims which may be filed before this Tribunal and (2) the law applicable to such claims. ''? The
Respondent reiterates that the Claimants can only bring claims for breaches of the 2003
Investment Law which are to be decided in accordance with Kyrgyz law. The Claimants’

reasoning cannot apply in this context, as it is borrowed from investment treaty proceedings in

cases where the applicable law does not resemble the applicable law in this case.'!*

666. According to the Respondent, there is no reason for the Tribunal to go beyond
Article 6(2) of the 2003 Investment Law.!'® Even if the Tribunal decided not to apply Article
6(2), however, “the application of general principles of Kyrgyz law on damages would lead to the
Claimants recovering no damages”.!'°

667. The Respondent adds that, even if the Claimants could bring a claim for a violation of
the Moscow Convention (which the Respondent denies), damages would still need to be assessed
according to Kyrgyz law.''®’ The Respondent notes that there is no scope for the application of
customary international law, as the Moscow Convention specifies that the standard of
compensation applicable to both “lawful” and “unlawful” nationalisations is to be determined in

accordance with the law of the host country.'!°*

668. The Respondent submits that the Tribunal must interpret Article 6 of the 2003
Investment Law in accordance with Kyrgyz law principles of statutory interpretation. The
Respondent notes that the 2003 Investment Law does not distinguish between “lawful” and
“unlawful” expropriation, and underscores that the Claimants have not suggested the existence of
such distinction under Kyrgyz law.''® The Respondent reiterates that the absence of an offer of
compensation to the Claimants does not render the expropriation “unlawful” as the only obligation
imposed by Article 6(1) of the 2003 Investment Law was to make a “proper legal procedure

1170

available” to the Claimants;''” a procedure which the Claimants decided not to pursue.!'”! The

Respondent points out that this position is consistent with the Chorzéw Factory decision,''” the

670. Furthermore, the Respondent argues that international tribunals have held that when
assessing damages “‘it is necessary to define with precision the scope and nature of [the investor’s]

Mining LLC did not have any legal right to any further license agreement or extension following
the expiry of Kutessay II License Agreement No. 3 and Kalesay License Agreement No. 2.'!78 In
circumstances as the present, where the SAGMR was legally entitled to revoke the Licenses, the

Respondent submits that there is no scope for compensation.!'”

671. The Respondent also contends that the Tribunal cannot award compensation “on the
speculative assumption that SAGMR would grant further indulgences[.J”!!*° Upon Kutisay
Mining LLC’s breach of its License Agreement, or its lapse without an extension, Kutisay
Mining LLC no longer had “a right to engage in activity” and no “investment” to be protected

672. According to the Respondent, the Claimants were aware of the consequences of
breaching the License Agreements, as they knew that CAMG, the previous licensee of Kutessay
II, lost its license for such reason.'!*? The Respondent contends that the Claimants agreed to the
License Agreements terms “knowing that they were not capable of complying with their terms.
Mr Aryev testified that this was clear from day one, and that it would take Stans five years to

requested any different relief on the basis of breaches of either one of these provisions. The

Tribunal can therefore consider the quantum on the basis of both breaches together.

674. Regarding the standard to determine the standard of the quantum, it is to be noted that,
for a breach, the provisions of subparagraphs 2 and 3 of Article 6 of the 2003 Investment Law are
not directly applicable as they refer to a lawful taking while the Tribunal has concluded that the
taking by the Respondent was not lawful. But it is clear that damages for an unlawful
dispossession should not be lower than those for a lawful one. The Tribunal, therefore, can take

guidance from the fair market standard provided in Art. 6(2) and (3) of the 2003 Investment Law.

VALUATION DATE

675. The Claimants argue that the value of their investments should be assessed as at 25 June
2012, the day before the 26 June 2012 Resolution. The Respondent submits that the valuation
date should be 16 October 2014, the day before the SAGMR terminated the Claimants’ Licenses.

1. The Claimants’ Position

676. The Claimants assert that the progressive destruction of Stans Energy’s market value
started with the 26 June 2012 Resolution.''™ Thus, to eliminate the effects of the Respondent’s
wrongful conduct, it will be necessary to use a valuation date before the series of measures
amounting to a creeping expropriation started.''’’ Accordingly, 25 June 2012 is the correct

valuation date.

677. The Claimants contend that choosing any later valuation date would allow the
Respondent to profit from its unlawful conduct by reducing the amount of payable compensation,
in view of negative effect produced by the anticipation that the asset will be expropriated.'!*° This
would go against the general principle that no one should be permitted to derive an advantage

from his own wrong (nullus commodum capere de sua iniuria propria).''*’ Otherwise, the

Claimants contend, the State “could adopt gradual adverse measures, formally expropriating only

after the value has dropped to reduce the compensation it must pay”.!'**

678. Relying on the full reparation principle under international law, the Claimants argue
that an assessment of compensation for a creeping expropriation must be done as of the first action
of a composite act, not the last.''*? The Claimants further allege that, if Article 6(2) of the 2003
Investment Law were applicable (which they deny for the reasons set out above), it would require

the same approach.!!°°

679. The Claimants deny that Mr. Aryev, during his testimony at the Hearing, conceded that
Kutisay Mining LLC was not prevented from progressing with its work even by the 15 April 2013
Inter-District Court of Bishkek injunction. This allegation, in the Claimants’ view,
“misrepresents” Mr. Aryev’s testimony”. The Claimants point out that Mr. Aryev also said that

“this injunction stopped our work.”!!°!

2. The Respondent’s Position

680. Relying on Article 6(2) of the 2003 Investment Law, the Respondent asserts that the
value of the investment is to be assessed as at the date of the alleged expropriation decision. !'°?
Hence, the Respondent submits that the valuation date should be 16 October 2014, the day before
the date when the SAGMR terminated the Claimants’ Licenses because, to the extent that there
may have been an expropriation, the SAGMR decision would constitute the “expropriation
decision” within the meaning of Article 6(2).!'°3

681. The Respondent contends that, even if the Tribunal were to assess the valuation of the
Licenses according to customary international law, the valuation date still should be the date of

the expropriation. !!4

682. In the alternative, the Respondent argues that the earliest conceivable date to value the
Licenses would be 14 April 2013, the day immediately preceding the Inter-District Court of
Bishkek injunction restraining all parties from taking any actions regarding the Licenses. '!°°
However, the Respondent notes that Mr. Aryev confirmed at the Hearing that the injunction did
not prevent Kutisay Mining LLC from progressing with its work. '!° Therefore, the Respondent
argues for 16 October 2014 as the correct valuation date.'!®” In any event, the Respondent notes
that its valuation expert, Mr. Ziff, confirmed in his second report that the Licenses had no value
as at 14 April 2013.'!°8 According to the Respondent, before this date the Claimants had the full
enjoyment of the Licenses, and no actions by the Respondent had any substantial impact on their
operations. '!°°

683. The Respondent objects to the “shifting” of the valuation date to the day before the 26
June 2012 Resolution. '?°° The Respondent notes that the Claimants support this shift on the basis
that the value of Stans Energy’s shares “had been almost completely destroyed by conduct
attributable to the Kyrgyz Government before the last formal step”.!?°' In response, the
Respondent asserts that the 26 June 2012 Resolution did not affect the Claimants’ use of the

Licenses. 7

It also points out that Mr. Ziff’s analysis “concludes that 91% of the price movement
in Stans Energy’s stock price in this period was attributable to market sentiments for the REE
sector generally”.'?°> More generally, the Respondent argues that when awarding damages it is
necessary to distinguish between diminution in value caused by wrongful acts of the host State
and diminution in value caused by general economic conditions.'*°* Damages should only be
awarded for the former, as recognised by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal and by

investment treaty tribunals. 2”

684. The Respondent also contests the Claimants’ assertion that “compensation for creeping
expropriation must be assessed as of the first action of the composite act”.'? The Respondent
denies that this is the case either under Kyrgyz law or under international law.'7°’ As regards
Kyrgyz law, the Respondent asserts that under the Kyrgyz Civil Code the Claimants would not
be entitled to damages, as they “have not put forward evidence to establish the position that they
would have been in but for the allegedly wrongful actions of the Kyrgyz Republic”.'?°* As regards
international law, the Respondent argues that “in the only investment authority cited” by the
Claimants, the tribunal in fact determined that the first step of the creeping expropriation qualified

as a “self-standing breach of FET”.

685. The Respondent notes that it has not “benefitted” in any way from its decision to
terminate the Licenses.'*!° The shift in the valuation date would result in the Tribunal awarding
the Claimants compensation for a deterioration in Stans Energy’s share price, which was not
attributable to the Respondent’s conduct but rather a consequence of the market situation of the
REEs sector in general.!*!! In the Respondent’s view, Mr. Dellepiane’s Third Report confirms
that “adopting the 25 June 2012 valuation date impermissibly compensates C[laimant]s for the

1212

deterioriation of the REE sector.

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

686. In Section VI.A.1 above, the Tribunal concluded that the Claimants were deprived of
the effective use and control of the mining Licenses at least when the SAGMR formally decided
their termination on 17 October 2014. The Tribunal was therefore satisfied that there was a
dispossession within the meaning of Article 6 of the 2003 Investment Law. In that context, the

Tribunal left open the question as to the precise date by which the dispossession occurred.

687. In determining the precise date of the expropriation of the Claimants’ investment, the
Tribunal refers to its discussion in Section VI.A.2 above. The Tribunal observed that the 26 June

2012 Resolution and the SAGMR’s August 2012 order to stop work were not implemented and

were irrelevant to the ultimate termination of the Licenses. The suspension order of 30 August
2012 did not prevent Stans Energy, after the suspension order expired on 30 September 2012,
from resuming its work on the Kutessay II project. Nor did the proceedings concerning the
invalidation of the 21 December 2009 Minutes bring Stans Energy’s operations to a halt. Rather,
Stans Energy was deprived of its investment only by the SAGMR’s decision of 17 October 2014,
by which the SAGMR’s Subsoil Use Licensing Commission decided to terminate Kutisay Mining

LLC’s Licenses on the basis of decisions of the Kyrgyz courts.

688. Accordingly, as the Tribunal has concluded above that the unlawful dispossession was
the SAGMR’s termination notice, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the valuation date
should be 16 October 2014, the day before the SAGMR terminated the Claimants’ Licenses.

VALUATION METHODOLOGY AND QUANTIFICATION

689. The Claimants argue that the Tribunal should employ the stock market capitalisation
approach to calculate damages, and conclude that the fair market value of their investments as at

25 June 2012 was US$ 128.23 million.

690. The Respondent contends that the only reliable way to valuate the Licenses is through
a discounted cash flow analysis, and concludes that the Licenses had no value at either 25 June
2012 or 16 October 2014. Therefore, the Claimants have no entitlement to damages. Should the
Tribunal not wish to use DCF analysis, damages should be awarded by reference to the amounts
actually spent in developing the Licenses. In this alternative, the Claimants would be at most

entitled to recover an amount of C$ 3 million spent.

1. The Claimants’ Position

a. The Claimants’ Valuation in Accordance with a Market Capitalisation
Approach
691. The Claimants argue that the Tribunal should employ the stock market capitalisation
approach, which calculates Stans Energy’s market capitalization through its share price.'?!? This

method eliminates the need for fact-finding about future costs and uncertainties, as this method

incorporates the market’s assessment of all known costs and risks. '?'* The Claimants contend that
the Respondent’s expert, Mr. Ziff, accepted during cross-examination at the Hearing that in
principle and under the relevant valuation guidelines of the mining industry, mining properties
should be valued using the market capitalisation approach. '?'5 On the basis of the publicly
available information on the valuation date, the Claimants conclude that the market capitalization

of Stans Energy was US$ 102.34 million.'7!°

692. The Claimants note that share prices represent a company’s fractional value, while they
argue that the asset affected by the Respondent’s wrongful conduct was the whole company. It is
an accepted principle of corporate finance that control of a company carries separate and
additional value in the market due to the opportunity of the owner to direct the business. '7!”
Accordingly, the Claimants argue that it is necessary to add a “control premium” to reflect the

1218

full value of the company,'?'* as Stans Energy’s rights would otherwise be undervalued. '?!° Mr.

Dellepiane concludes that 25.3% is a reasonable control premium on the basis of the “evidence
from a closely related industry and the same time period as the case at hand”.'?° After adding the
control premium, the Claimants calculate the fair market value of their investments as at 25 June
2012 as US$ 128.23 million.'*?! The Claimants reject Mr. Ziff’s suggestion to apply a discount
rate rather than a control premium, noting that “discounts accorded for equity offerings in order

to raise capital to fund the company’s operations have nothing to do with control premiums that

>> 1222

are paid when acquiring a majority stake in a company”.

693. The Claimants argue that the same valuation should be applied regardless of whether
the Tribunal ultimately decides that the Respondent unlawfully expropriated Stans’ investments
or failed to accord fair and equitable treatment under the 2003 Investment Law, the 2010
Investment Protection Decree, the Moscow Convention or general international law. '77

of the Claimants’ Licenses amounted to a lawful expropriation, the same approach to valuation

should be applied.!?*

694. The Claimants address the following criticisms by the Respondent regarding the use of
the stock market capitalisation method: (1) that Stans Energy was not a single asset company, and
its stock was illiquid; (2) that Stans Energy withheld material information from the market; and
(3) that the Claimants would not have been able to raise the necessary funding to develop the
mines. '?°5

695. First, the Claimants argue that Mr. Ziff uses a set of rules to measure liquidity created
for another purpose (preventing stock price manipulation) which have no bearing on valuation or
on whether the share price reflects the underlying asset value.'”° Mr. Dellepiane, on the other
hand, identifies two measures of liquidity that do indicate whether a share price will be a reliable
indicator of underlying value. Those measures show that Stans Energy shares were of average
liquidity in comparison with similar mining companies.'?”’ Regarding the contention that Stans
Energy owned other assets and that the License Agreements only represented a small portion
thereof, the Claimants assert that all cash and short-term investments were directly related to the
development of the mining projects, which was Stans Energy’s only substantial activity at the
time. !?8

696. Second, the Claimants deny that they withheld any material information from the
market when they chose not to disclose the AsiaRud Reports. Had that been the case, they would
have been subject to regulatory enforcement and security fraud claims by their shareholders. They
note that Stans Energy has never been investigated, and no market participant has ever suggested
that any information was withheld. '”° In the Claimants’ view, Stans Energy was in fact prohibited

from disclosing such information pursuant to Canadian securities regulations insofar as it had not

been prepared by a “Qualified Person”. !”° In any event, the Claimants allege that the Respondent
admitted at the Hearing that Stans Energy had no obligation to disclose the AsiaRud Report to the
market.'*3' According to the Claimants, “[t]he market always had the information that Stans

Energy was allowed to disclose under the applicable disclosure rules”. |?

697. The Claimants also reject the Respondent’s additional argument that Stans Energy
misled the market by publishing “aspirational statements” in respect of the start of production.
The Claimants deny that Stans Energy breached Section 4A of National Instrument 51-102.
Among other things, the Claimants point out that NI 51-102 applies only to information “other
than forward-looking information contained in oral statements”, while the statements cited by

the Respondent are oral.'?*7

698. Third, regarding the ability to raise the necessary funding, the Claimants argue that they
provided substantial evidence regarding third-party interest in Stans Energy and further argue
that, in any case, the availability and cost of financing are already reflected in the share price of

publicly traded companies. '254

699. Turning to other possible valuation methods, the Claimants explain that their expert,

Mr. Dellepi di ded the use of book-value and other asset-based hes, such as

 

replacement value, liquidation value or the historical values of capital contributions, as he
considered these inappropriate. '5 Mr. Dellepiane also determined that a market multiples
approach would not be possible as there are too few comparable publicly-traded companies in the
REEs market.'?*° He finally concluded that a stock market valuation would be relatively superior

to the income approach because it “is based on real transactions and represents an amalgam of all

investor expectations regarding the parameters described above”. '?*”

to be inappropriate, alleging that it is an unreliable valuation method for mining properties as it

“will consistently understate the value of mining assets in periods of price volatility, because it
does not capture the value of “optionality””.'7* Moreover, Mr. Dellepiane considers the use of
DCF methodology to be inconsistent with the Respondent’s view that the REEs market was in
“free-fall”, as this method is highly sensitive to certain key assumptions; the DCF method
becomes speculative when prices are unstable.'?* A reliable estimate can only be obtained on the
basis of substantial information regarding past and future income. The analysis of Mr. Ziff, in
contrast, is based almost entirely on a preliminary economic analysis of the projects.'”“°

701. Finally, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that any loss was entirely
attributable to the background economic conditions, arguing that the correlation analysis used by

1241

Mr. Ziff is unconvincing, does not prove causality'*"' and, in any event, the companies selected

as comparators are not comparable to Stans Energy. !2?

702. The Claimants further aver that the Respondent’s position that their projects were
valueless “is also impossible to reconcile with the Republic’s recent tenders for the Kutessay II
and Kalesay mines, demanding a US$10 million up-front fee from investors, based on a

government-commissioned valuation of US$110 million”.'?43

i. The Market Capitalisation Approach as at Alternative Valuation Dates

704. In response to the Tribunal’s questions, the Claimants applied a market capitalization
approach to two further hypothetical valuation dates, in addition to the valuation date of 25 June

2012 discussed above (which results in a value of US$ 128.23 million).!24

705. Pursuant to the Tribunal’s questions, the Claimants calculated the amount of damages
following a market capitalisation approach as at 14 April 2013 and as at 16 October 2014.'*° The
Claimants note that the application of the market capitalisation approach to these dates “is slightly
more difficult” as the share price observed in the market on these dates “incorporates the market’s
expectations and judgment concerning the illegal measures taken by the Kyrgyz Republic since

26 June 2012.”!74°

706. Since the Claimants consider that using the share price observed at these alternative
dates would not re-establish the situation in which they would have been but for the Respondent’s
wrongful measures, Mr. Dellepiane instead referred to the “actual share price movement up to the
last trading date that was free of any threat of unlawful act and then makes it evolve according to
a relevant industry index.” '*’ Accordingly, Mr. Dellepiane calculated Stans Energy’s
hypothetical share price as at the alternative dates “by reference to the movement of an index
comprised of other publicly-traded REE companies.”'*** He later used this corrected share price
to determine Stans Energy’s counterfactual market capitalisation adjusted by the relevant control
premia at the relevant dates.'*? Mr. Dellepiane’s calculations result in a valuation of US$ 91.3

million as at 14 April 2013; and a valuation of US$ 58.7 million as at 16 October 2014. 2°

ii. | The Income Approach as at Different Valuation Dates

707. First, the Claimants reiterate their consideration of an income approach as an
inappropriate method to value their investments.'7*! They argue that DCF is “massively sensitive

to input date and assumptions”; !° i

is “directly contrary to the valuation guidelines applicable in
the Canadian mining industry, i.e., the CIMVal Guidelines”,!?*° which would not approve the use
of DCF for mining properties at Kutessay’s II stage of development; !*™ “ignores the economic
reality of mining projects[,]” and does not capture their “optionality” value.'?%>

708. The Claimants provided, in response to the Tribunal’s questions, DCF analyses as at
different valuation dates and with varying assumptions. '7*° All of the DCF calculations requested
by the Tribunal result in a negative value. '?57

709. The Claimants point out that the DCF analyses prepared at the Tribunal’s request “rely
heavily on OPEX and CAPEX assumptions drawn from the AsiaRud Reports [...] [which] are
the result of very preliminary economic analysis.”!*** They contend that these assumptions ignore

the Claimants’ actual plans for the mine development. '?*°

710. The Claimants explain that Mr. Dellepiane used price forecasts and price assumptions
different from those indicated by the Tribunal in order to illustrate the high sensitivity of DCF

1260

analyses to price assumptions. '**’ Depending on the underlying assumptions, the DCF results in

valuations ranging from negative US$ 486 million to positive US$ 240 million for the same

the present circumstances.” !?°?

iii. | The Sunk Costs Approach as at Different Valuation Dates

711. The Claimants consider that a sunk costs approach “do[es] not accurately reflect fair
market value of an investment” since it only reflects past costs but does not capture the
investment’s “profit-generating potential[.]”!?* Similarly, the Claimants point out that Mr. Ziff

confirmed that book value does not represent fair market value. '?

712. The Claimants calculate the amounts invested by Stans Energy as at the three
hypothetical valuation dates indicated by the Tribunal.!?° The calculations were made by

1266

Mr. Dellepiane on the basis of Stans Energy’s financial statements on the record,'*°° and two

interim financial statements for the years 2013 and 2014.7

713. Mr. Dellepiane’s calculations result in an amount of US$ 17.3 million as at 25 June

2012; US$ 23.1 million as at 14 April 2013; and US$30.6 million as at 16 October 2014. °°

calculations. 7

iv. Insufficient Information for Conventional Valuation Methodologies

715. The Claimants argue that “[t]he obligation to make full reparation for damage caused
by a wrongful act is unaffected by any difficulty in quantifying the magnitude of the harm based
on the information available.”'?”° In support of this position, several decisions of the International

Court of Justice are invoked.!2""

716. According to the Claimants, even in cases in which the exact damage caused cannot be

ascertained with certainty, investment tribunals have recognised that “the Tribunal must do its

v1

 

best to quantify the loss caused to the Claimants by the Respondent’s wrongful acts. Some

tribunals have determined that such difficulties “should be resolved by reference to a ‘rule of

reason’ or reasonable approximation.” !?”

717. According to the Claimants, the Respondent “cannot benefit from the difficulties
created by a creeping expropriation over a period of important price fluctuations in the REE
market” in order to escape the obligation to make full reparation.'? Thus, even if the Tribunal
were of the view that the information available is insufficient to precisely determine the

Claimants’ loss, the Tribunal would need to “determine the amount of damage that it considers

1275

rational and fair based on the evidence submitted by the Parties.

718. The Claimants argue that the Tribunal should pay due regard to the valuation of the
expropriated mining properties prepared by the Respondent in relation to the re-tendering of the
mining licenses in 2016,'?” and take into consideration the strategic importance of REEs for a

range of essential technological products and procedures. !2"7

2. The Respondent’s Position
a. The Respondent’s Valuation in Accordance with an Income Approach

719. The Respondent argues that even if the Tribunal were to find that it had expropriated
the Licenses, the Claimants would have suffered no damage because the Licenses were
worthless. '2”* The Respondent notes that the Claimants’ own engineers, AsiaRud, advised them
that the project was “loss making”—information which the Respondent claims was “deliberately
concealed” from the market and from the Claimants’ CFO.'?” The Respondent also contends that
Mr. Irwin confirmed at the Hearing that Stans Energy did not obtain any independent advice to
contradict AsiaRud’s conclusions.'**° Nor did Stans Energy seek the views of Stans’ Qualified
Person (Dr. Savchenko) with regard to the negative AsiaRud 2013 Report.'?*! Furthermore, even
if the Claimants had wanted to pursue production, they would not have been able to raise the
necessary funds; and, in any event, the Licenses were liable to termination due to persistent
breaches of their terms. !*?

720. As noted above, the Respondent argues that the Claimants’ use of the share price of
Stans Energy in June 2012 as the basis for their valuation is as an attempt to benefit from the
REEs price bubble of 2010-2012 in a moment where their value was already falling sharply. '7*?
The Respondent considers that “[t]he share price of Stans Energy bore no relation to the value of
the Licenses [...] The only reliable way to value the Licenses is through using a discounted cash

flow (“DCF”) analysis”.'** The Tribunal should establish the fair market value of the Licenses

on the basis of the DCF method, which represents the market standard for the valuation of mining

1285

and other limited life licenses, while the market capitalisation method advanced by the

Claimants cannot be relied upon. !?*°

721. The Respondent notes that the Claimants have not invoked any case in which an
investment tribunal has assessed damages by reference to the value of shares traded on the stock
exchange. Rather, the only authority relied on by them is Khan v. Mongolia where, the
Respondent notes, “the tribunal declined to award compensation by reference to Khan’s market
capitalisation on the Toronto stock exchange [...] recogni[zing] that Khan’s share price bore little
resemblance to the underlying asset”.!7*” Other investment tribunals and scholars have similarly
recognised the limitations of the market capitalisation approach. !7**

722. Moreover, the CIMVal (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum
Mineral Property Valuation Committee) Standards and Guidelines (“CIMVal’), applicable at the
valuation date advanced by the Claimants and upon which Mr. Dellepiane relies, make it clear
that the DCF method is a primary valuation methodology and “[g]enerally accepted in Canada
as the preferred method”, while market capitalisation is a secondary method, which is “/m/Jore

applicable to Valuation of single property asset junior companies than to properties ”.!?*°

723. According to the Respondent, there is evidence that Stans Energy’s management

recognised that its share price did not reflect the value of the underlying assets.'?°° Hence, Stans

Energy’s share price is not a suitable proxy for the value of the Licenses, and market capitalisation

is not an appropriate valuation method. '?°!

724, Even if the market capitalisation approach could be used as a primary valuation method
(which the Respondent denies),'?” the Respondent contends that Mr. Dellepiane relies on several
assumptions that are unfounded and make its use inappropriate in this case, namely (1) that the
market was being kept informed; '?”? (2) that the market was sufficiently liquid; '?” (3) that Stans

1295

Energy’s “sole significant asset” was the Licenses;'*”° and (4) that it would have been possible to

obtain financing to develop the project.'?°°

725. First, the Respondent maintains that the Claimants did not comply with their disclosure

obligations under Canadian law,'?°”

of the economic assessments produced by AsiaRud on 2011 and 2013.!2§ The Respondent also
points out that Stans Energy’s disclosures were “overwhelmingly promotional, aspirational and
ambitious”.!7°° The Respondent further contends that Claimants misled the market by, inter alia,
claiming that Kutisay had complied with its license agreement obligations and had delivered all
the required documentation. '°°°

101.'°°' Furthermore, it is underscored that the Claimants have failed to disclose the legal advice
which they allegedly received and which purportedly formed the basis of their decisions whether
to disclose certain information. °°

727. In any event, even if Stans Energy did comply with its disclosure obligations (which
the Respondent denies), the market was not informed of facts material to assessing the value of
the Kutessay II and Kalesay projects with the result that the market capitalisation approach

advocated for by the Claimants is not appropriate for valuing the Licenses.'*°

728. Second, the Respondent argues that a company’s shares must be sufficiently liquid in
order to use the market capitalisation approach.'*™ Mr. Ziff considers that Regulation M, despite
having been originally designed to be used in the context of policing market manipulation,
provides an appropriate standard to determine whether shares are sufficiently liquid.'*°° Stans

Energy’s

 

shares fail to meet this test at the Claimants’ proposed valuation date.'*°° However,
while Mr. Dellepiane criticizes the use of such standard, he himself merely assumes that the TSX
Venture Exchange was liquid and Stans Energy was of average liquidity.'°°’ Hence, according to
the Respondent, the Claimants have failed to demonstrate that Stans Energy’s shares were

sufficiently liquid to allow the use of the market capitalisation approach. '*°*

729. Third, the Claimants’ reliance on the market capitalisation approach rests on the
assumption that Stans Energy was a single asset company. However, the Claimants’ expert has
not developed any analysis as to whether the value of Stans Energy’s shares was entirely

attributable to the Kutessay II and Kalesay developments. '*”° The Respondent points to Mr. Ziff’s

conclusion that Stans Energy was not viewed by the market as a single asset company. '*!°

Accordingly, it would be inappropriate to value the Licenses by reference to Stans Energy’s share

price.34

730. Fourth, the Respondent claims that, even if the Licenses had not been cancelled, the

Claimants would not have been able to develop them into production because they did not have

1312

the necessary financing. '*!* The Respondent points out that the Claimants allege that “significant

third-party interest in Stans Energy emerg[ed] throughout 2011” but have failed to provide

sufficient evidence to support this contention.'*!3

731. Even if market capitalisation were an appropriate methodology, Mr. Ziff criticizes (1)
that Mr. Dellepiane has failed to deduct the approximate C$15.8 million of cash and short term
investment assets which Stans Energy held as at 25 June 2012;'4 and (2) considers that it would
be inappropriate to apply a control premium to Stans Energy. '*!> Rather, given Stans Energy own
capital issuance history, Mr. Ziff considers that it may in fact be more appropriate to apply a

control discount of approximately 18.5%. 13!

732. The Respondent submits that the Claimants’ Licenses had no value either at 25 June
2012 or 16 October 2014. '*!’ In reaching this conclusion, Mr. Ziff relied on the detailed
information provided by the Claimants’ project engineers, AsiaRud, to develop his DCF analysis

taking 25 June 2012 as valuation date. In this regard, the Respondent argues that the 2011

1318

AsiaRud 2011 Report conforms to the standards for a prefeasibility study'*'* and, contrary to the

Claimants’ assertions, provides a reliable basis for undertaking a DCF analysis. '3""

733. Mr. Ziff then adjusted those figures by applying the REEs prices forecast contained in
the 2012 Visiongain report'*”° (which provides independent forecasts on REEs prices and was

produced before the Claimants’ proposed valuation date).'*7! The Respondent points out that

contemporaneous independent REEs forecasts exist, which all confirm that the REEs prices were
1322

projected to decline significantly over the coming year.
734. Finally, the Respondent explains that Mr. Ziff reached the conclusion that the project
would have been so costly that it would be uneconomic regardless of the discount rate used (even
using a WACC of 0%).'*? The Respondent notes Mr. Ziff’s conclusion that the project has a NPV
of negative US$ 456.8 million, and his confirmation through sensitivity analysis that the Kutessay
II License was worthless. °** While the Respondent acknowledges that valuation always involves
an element of uncertainty, “the NPV of the project is so negative, that what is certain is that the
Licenses were worthless”.'°>

735. The Respondent notes that Mr. Dellepiane relied on a DCF analysis produced by Visor
Capital to verify his valuation of the Claimants’ investments. '*”° This reliance on a DCF valuation
to confirm his results is contradictory with his qualification of the use of a DCF valuation as not
reliable.'*?7 In any event, the Respondent points out that Mr. Ziff explains that the DCF analysis
invoked by Mr. Dellepiane is based on key assumptions very different from the ones contained in
the 2011 AsiaRud Report, presumably because such report was not disclosed to the public. '*”
According to Mr. Ziff, had the conclusions contained in the AsiaRud Report been used, Mr.
Dellepiane’s analysis would also have concluded that the project was valueless. '?° Mr. Ziff
demonstrates that, with adjustments to the Visor Capital’s DCF analysis, the result is an NPV

value of negative US$ 427 million.'*°

primary approach to valuing mines (DCF), all independent forecasts and assumptions led to a
negative NPV.”'>*? The Respondent considers that Mr. Dellepiane adjusted several assumptions

of Mr. Ziff's DCF model, such as capital expenditure and operating costs, mill recovery rates, '**3

1334

and timing of production, '*** without any basis.'**5 The Respondent argues that, even if a wide

sensitivity analysis is conducted, the value of the mining rights remains negative. '**°

737. Mr. Ziff also developed an alternative DCF analysis taking 16 October 2014 as
valuation date and concluded that the Licenses had zero value at this date on the basis of (1) his
conclusion that they had no value as at 25 June 2012; (2) the continued deterioration of the REEs
market between June 2012 and October 2014; (3) AsiaRud’s view that the project has a negative
NPV as at July 2013.'997

738. The Respondent notes that the Claimants’ expert alleges that rather than using the DCF,
a more appropriate income approach would be based on a real options analysis. '°* The
Respondent disagrees, noting, among other issues, that the ability of a license holder to act is
significantly constrained by the licensing conditions.'**° The Respondent contends that, while
DCF is frequently applied in investment arbitration cases, the Claimants have not pointed to any

decision in which a real options analysis has been applied.'*°

739. Finally, the Respondent argues, in the event that the Tribunal were to conclude that the
project prospects are too speculative to value the Licenses using the DCF method, the Tribunal
should award no damages, as the burden of proof rests on the Claimants.'*' Alternatively,
“damages should be awarded by reference to the amounts actually spent in developing the
Licenses [...] there is evidence establishing that the Claimants spent the around C$ 3 million

developing the Licenses”,'*¥?

b. The Respondent’s Responses to the Tribunal’s Questions Annexed to
Procedural Order No. 9
740. The Respondent’s answers to the questions put to the Parties in Procedural Order No. 9
are summarized below.
i. | The Market Capitalisation Approach as at Different Valuation Dates
741. Pursuant to the Tribunal’s instructions, Mr. Ziff calculated the amounts of damages

following a market capitalisation approach as at 25 June 2012, 14 April 2013, and 16 October
2014,1343

742. The Respondent considers that Stans Energy’s share price fell after 25 June 2012 “in
line with general REE market conditions”, which was accepted by Mr. Dellepiane.'*“* The decline
in Stans Energy’s share price between the three valuation dates is, in the Respondent’s view,
“attributable to the general deterioration in the REE market as opposed to R[espondent]’s alleged
measures, and for which no compensation is due”.'*“> For the purposes of his analysis, Mr. Ziff
prepared his preferred index of Stans Energy’s main traded comparable companies (“Main
Composite Index”); *“° and an alternative index taking into account the companies proposed by

Mr. Dellepiane (“Alternative Composite Index”).'*”

743. The Respondent argues that there is no basis to apply a control premium, and that the

1348,

Claimants have not offered any authority supporting otherwise. The Respondent also

considers that cash, cash equivalents and all other unrelated assets must be deducted.'*” The

Respondent contends that Mr. Dellepiane’s justification for not deducting cash balance (i.e. that

it was used “for arbitration-related expenses”’) “is unevidenced and is contrary to Article 40(2)

of the UNCITRAL Rules, concerning the Tribunal’s discretion to award costs.”!3°°

744, The value estimated by Mr. Ziff on the basis of a market capitalisation approach results
in an amount of US$ 55.45 million as at 25 June 2012;'*5' US$ 6.71 million as at 14 April
2013;'3°? and US$ 12.46 million as at 16 October 2014.'3% For the latter valuation date, Mr. Ziff
adds that his preferred approach would be to use an “extrapolated” market capitalisation which

would result:

(1) using the Main Composite Index, in an estimated value of either US$ 5.21 million (using
the market cap as at 25 June 2012) or US$ 1.72 million (using the market cap as at 14 April
2013); and

(2) using the Alternative Composite Index, in an estimated value of either US$ 7.98 million
(using the market cap as at 25 June 2012) or US$ 4.51 million (using the market cap as at 14 April
2013).'

745. The Respondent argues that Mr. Dellepiane’s calculations made in response to the
Tribunal’s request in Procedural Order No. 9 are “materially inflated”. In particular, it disagrees
with the approach of “us[ing] Stans’ market capitalization on 25 June 2012 to assess damages as
at 14 April 2013 and 16 October 2014.”!°*° Moreover, the Respondent considers that the
Claimants have failed to prove any “permanent impact” of the Respondent’s conduct on Stans
Energy’s share price. The correct approach would be to refer to Stans Energy’s market

capitalization on 12 April 2013, the day before Stans Energy announced the Prosecutor’s

proceedings. '°*7

ii. | The Income Approach as at Alternative Valuation Dates

746. In response to the Tribunal’s questions, the Respondent’s expert, Mr. Ziff, having

performed his own DCF sensitivity analyses, '*°*

concluded that “even with generous
assumptions, the value of the Kutessay II project is severely negative under all scenarios.” °°? The
Respondent points out that this is confirmed by the analysis of the Claimants’ expert: “Mr.
Dellepiane’s own DCF calculations in his Responses to the Tribunal’s Questions confirm that the
project would be unprofitable under ail scenarios (however generous to C[laimant]s, on all
valuation dates.)”'* The Respondent disagrees that such a result is “absurd”. In particular, the
Respondent disputes that the REEs pricing assumption or operating costs were too uncertain to

conduct a DCF analysis.'*°!

TAT. The Respondent contends that there is “no evidential basis for assuming lower operating

costs or a higher extraction/recovery rate” than in the AsiaRud Reports.'*°?

In particular, the
Respondent notes that the Claimants “do not even allege that [new] technology could have
reduced operating costs by more than the Tribunal-requested sensitivity analysis of 25%.”
According to the Respondent, the significance of the VNIIHT reports was overstated by the

1364

Claimants during Mr. Ziff's cross-examination at the Hearing,'** as would be evidenced by the

fact that none of the reports are cited by Mr. Dellepiane in his expert reports.'*°°

7A8. The Respondent notes that the Claimants have not submitted any expert evidence to
prove “likely cost savings from these chemistry studies.”'*% It adds that, despite being granted

permission to admit new evidence “concerning the cos

 

s of extracting REEs and new

 

technology”, the Claimants failed to produce such evidence (other than a generalized media

release).'*°’ Accordingly, the Claimants’ reliance on Mr. Aryev’s “unsubstantiated assertions”
that “new technologies would have substantially reduced operating expenses” does not discharge

the Claimants’ burden of proof. '**

iii. | The Sunk Costs Approach as at Different Valuation Dates

749. The Respondent argues that, to the extent that the Kyrgyz Republic was legally entitled
to revoke the Licenses, they have no value and the Claimants have no right to recover any sunk
costs in respect of alleged work completed, costs which would have been incurred
notwithstanding the alleged measures.'*° Moreover, it is not open to the Claimants to claim their
sunk costs, as the Respondent considers that it has established “on the balance of probabilities”
that the value of their mining rights was “overwhelmingly negative”.'>”°

750. Nevertheless, the Respondent contends that, on the basis of the information on the
record, as contained in Stans Energy’s Consolidated Financial Statements, “the upper limit of
C[laimant]s’ expenditures on Kutessay II and Kalesay between 2009 and 16 October 2014 (which
remain unproven) is approximately CAD$ 2,460,385.”157!

751. The Respondent argues that, despite its request in the document production phase, '*”*

the Claimants failed to particularise and evidence:

the nature, date and amount of the expenditures, that the sums were actually expended by
Stans or Kutisay and were directly concerned with the projects, and that they were reasonably
and legitimately incurred. '573

752. The Respondent does not accept the amounts stated in the Financial Statements as
proven.'>” In particular, these Statements do not show that “the alleged expenditures were spent
in relation to the Kutessay II and Kalesay licenses.” 75 Among other things, it is “unclear” to

what extent the amounts claimed include “expenditures for the Kashka Chemical Processing

Plant”, which was a “separate asset, owned by a separate legal entity”, and in relation to which
no expropriation has been alleged.'*”° Moreover, the Respondent argues that “[t]he Licenses
overpayment should not be recovered [...] Even if the overpayment was not a bribe, Stans
Energy’s management were negligent in paying double the fees[.]”!*”’ Likewise, the Respondent
considers that the Tribunal should also exclude costs incurred “when Kutisay only held an expired
license agreement or after its final deadline for submission of its TP under Kutessay LA 3”, as

they were not legitimately incurred.'°”*

753. With regard to alternative valuation date of 14 April 2013, the Respondent argues that,
on the basis of the evidence on the record, the upper limit of the Claimants’ expenditures (which
are said to remain unproven) is approximately C$ 2,356,453.'5” In this case, the Respondent also
argues that “overpayment for the licenses, and costs incurred when Kutisay did not hold a valid

license agreement, should be excluded.”'**°

iv. Insufficient Information for Conventional Valuation Methodologies

754. The Respondent reiterates that the Claimants bear the burden of proving their alleged
injury.'°*! In this regard, the Respondent disputes the relevance of decisions of the International
Court of Justice relied upon by the Claimants, as these concerned “claims for environmental
damage, which by its nature is difficult (if not impossible) to quantify in monetary terms.”'**?
None of these authorities relieve the Claimants from the burden of “proving that the investments

991383

would be profitable.

755. According to the Respondent, should the Tribunal find that there is “insufficient
information for conventional valuation methodologies”, it would follow that the application of
those conventional methods would be too speculative and the Claimants would not have met their

burden of proof.'*™™ In this vein, the Respondent invokes the decision in SPP v. Egypt which held

that “[o]ne of the best settled rules of the law on international responsibility of States is that no

756. The Respondent points out that international tribunals have rejected DCF analyses in
cases where the investment “lacked a history of performance record and profitability[.]”!**° The
Respondent also notes that the tribunal in Bear Creek v. Peru, following Vivendi v. Argentina,
held that in order to overcome the lack of a history of profitability, “the claimant needed to
produce ‘convincing evidence of its ability to produce profits in the particular circumstances it

faced’ 787

757. The Respondent acknowledges that a number of international tribunals have adopted
the approach of awarding sunk costs when the application of other valuation methods based on
“potential expected profitability’ (such as the DCF method), is too ‘speculative and
uncertain’.” °** Nonetheless, the Respondent considers it inappropriate to award sunk costs

where, as here:

the evidence shows that the investment would, on the balance of probabilities, be loss-
making, otherwise C[laimant]s will be put in a better position than they would have been in
but for R[espondent]’s alleged measures. "°°

The Respondent argues that this follows from the Chorzéw Factory principle'*” and Article 6(2)

of the 2003 Investment Law. 3"!

758. The Respondent disputes the Claimants’ suggestion that methodological “difficulties”
are created in the present case by “important price fluctuations in the REE market”. The
Respondent characterizes these fluctuations as a “temporary REE price bubble in 2011-2012”,
which “burst in 2012”. The Claimants’ investment “was only potentially viable during the

temporary price bubble.”!*°

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis
a. Methodology

759. Turning to possible valuation methodologies, the Tribunal considers that the stock
market capitalization approach advocated by the Claimants is not appropriate in this case. This is
so because the market was not adequately informed about the real value of Stans Energy, given
that the AsiaRud Reports were not disclosed. Therefore, the Tribunal need not address the status
of the Reports under Canadian law; it suffices to note that the content of those Reports, if available
to the market, would in all probability have significantly changed the market’s perception of the

company’s value.

760. Similarly, the DCF approach advocated by the Respondent is not appropriate. Stans
Energy was at an early stage of its business activities, and still far away from being an ongoing

concern. Accordingly, a projection of future cash flows would be too speculative.

761. The sunk costs approach has been widely applied by tribunals in cases where a loss of
profits is at best speculative, but there is no consistent reasoning for the application of this

approach. In essence, three approaches can be found in the reported decisions:
(a) Tribunal awards sunk investment costs without any consideration of causation;

(b) Despite recognizing doubts as to the commercial prospects of the investment, tribunal

awards sunk investment costs; and

(c) Tribunal considers commercial prospect of investment and either adjusts compensation or

provides justification for awarding full investment costs.

762. In most of the cases in the summary that follows, only one of the alternatives is applied
without consideration of other criteria for determining causation. Moreover, a number of cases do
not distinguish between causation of injury/loss and causation of any specific damage. Hereafter,

a summary of the respective case law is provided:

i. Tribunal Awards Sunk Investment Costs Without Consideration of Causation

763. In one category of cases, tribunals, having reached the conclusion that lost profits were
too speculative, then proceeded to award actual investment costs as a proxy for the fair market
value of the investment. These tribunals do not appear to have made any enquiry as to whether,
but-for the wrongful acts of the respondent State, it was likely that the investment would have
generated profits or recouped its investment costs. In the absence of any explanation in the
relevant awards, it is difficult to determine whether these tribunals did not regard proof of
causation as necessary, or whether it was evident to them in the particular case that the investment

had substantial value (exceeding the claimant’s investment costs).

764. An oft-cited case is Metalclad v. Mexico, where the tribunal found that Mexico had
failed to treat Metalclad fairly and equitably and indirectly expropriated Metalclad’s investment
by denying Metalclad a local construction permit to complete a waste disposal landfill. '%°
According to that tribunal, Mexico’s actions resulted in the “complete frustration of the operation
of the landfill and negate[d] the possibility of any meaningful return on Metalclad’s
investment.”'*** The tribunal rejected Metalclad’s proposal to use a discounted cash flow analysis
to establish the fair market value of the investment because “the landfill was never operative and
any award based on future profits would be wholly speculative.”!**> Instead, the tribunal found
that “fair market value is best arrived at in this case by reference to Metalclad’s actual investment

in the project”'** and that this award is consistent with the Chorzéw Factory principle in that it

“wipe[s] out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish[es] the situation which would

in all probability have existed if that act had not been committed (the status quo ante).”'?""

765. Similarly in Biloune v. Ghana, where the tribunal found that Ghana had expropriated
Mr. Biloune’s interest in a hotel venture, the tribunal declined to award lost profits because “at
the time of the project’s suspension and effective expropriation, the project remained uncompleted
and unoperative [and] was generating no revenue, still less profits.”'°* Accordingly, “[g]iven the
nature of the project, and its early interruption by the respondents, the Tribunal ... concluded that
the most appropriate method for valuing the damages to be paid will be to return to Mr. Biloune
the amounts he invested in MDCL, i.e., restitution.” °°"

766. In both cases, the tribunals justified their award of actual investment costs, inter alia,
on the basis that it would restore the status quo ante and provide restitution to the claimant. It
may be argued, however, that the tribunals mistakenly sought to restore the claimants to the
position in which they would have been, had they not made the investment in the first place, rather
than the position in which they would have been, had the respondents had not committed the
wrongful acts in question. Such an approach would arguably absolve the claimants of the initial
business risk that they voluntarily took on when making the investment in the first instance. An
approach of restituting investment costs to restore the status quo ante may primarily be
appropriate in cases where there is a fundamental misrepresentation by, or other relevant
shortcoming attributable to, the respondent prior to an investment being made, such that, but for
the wrongful actions of the respondent, no investment would have been made at all (in other

words, case where an investment was induced by the respondent’s breach).

ii. | Despite Recognizing Doubts as to the Commercial Prospects of the Investment,
Tribunal Awards Sunk Investment Costs

767. In a second category of cases, tribunals have given some consideration to causation,
noted some scepticism as to whether the claimant would have generated profits if the respondent

had not committed any wrongful acts, but nevertheless proceeded to award full investment costs.

768. For example, in Wena Hotels v. Egypt, after finding that Egypt had expropriated the
claimant’s interest in two hotel ventures,’ the tribunal rejected the claimant’s claim for lost
profits (on the basis of a DCF analysis) on the basis that “there is insufficiently ‘solid base on
which to found any profit...or for predicting growth or expansion of the investment made’ by
Wena.”""! To the contrary, the tribunal noted that “Wena had operated the Luxor Hotel for less
than eighteen months, and had not even completed its renovations on the Nile Hotel, before they
were seized on April 1, 1991. In addition, there is some question whether Wena had sufficient

that “the proper calculation of ‘the market value of the investment expropriated immediately
before the expropriation’, is best arrived at, in this case, by reference to Wena’s actual investments

in the two hotels.”!“

769. In Vivendi II, the tribunal held that Argentina expropriated the claimants’ investment in
a concession agreement to provide water and sewage services but denied the claimants’ claim for
lost profits on the basis that they “failed to establish with a sufficient degree of certainty that the
Tucuman concession would have been profitable.”'“ The tribunal then went on to note that the
provincial water and sewage services company that existed before it was privatized and taken
over by the claimant “was never self-sufficient — in the early ‘90’s its revenues covered only 30%
of its expenses [...] had routinely been looted by successive provincial governments, its
operations had been deteriorating steadily, it could not provide services to cover the growth rate
of the population, it operated with an average deficit of US$17 million.” In addition, the
tribunal noted, the claimant never made a profit while it had operational control of the

concession. '4°° Nevertheless, the tribunal held that the “‘investment value’ of the concession

appears to offer the closest proxy, if only partial, for compensation sufficient to eliminate the

consequences of the Province’s actions.”!4°"

770. A similar conclusion was reached in Jmpregilo v. Argentina, where the tribunal held
that Argentina failed to accord Impregilo fair and equitable treatment with respect to its contract
for a concession to privatize water and sewage services in Buenos Aires. '** The tribunal rejected
the claimant’s proposed income-based valuation because of doubts as to the profitability of the
concession in a risk area with a poor population and low collectivity rate, even in the absence of
interference by Argentina.'*” Nevertheless, the tribunal acknowledged that “[t]he failure of the
concession can [...] be ascribed partly to events for which AGBA stood the risk and partly to acts
or failures by the Province.”'*!° The tribunal then proceeded to base its award on the capital
contributions made by Impregilo, reasoning that while it could not precisely evaluate the loss
incurred, “Argentina should in principle be obliged to restitute the investment to Impregilo as

compensation for its failure to ensure fair and equitable treatment to the concession.”!4!!

771. In these cases, and others, '*!? tribunals appear to have considered the issue of causation
with respect to the question of lost profits, but not with respect to investment costs. In Wena, one
might surmise that the tribunal was mainly concerned about the particular claimant's ability to
bring the project to fruition but had no doubt as to the value as such of the opportunity to operate
the hotels. In Jmpregilo and Vivendi II, however, the absence of analysis of causation is more
difficult to understand. Indeed, if the provincial water and sewage services company in Vivendi
JI was never self-sufficient, operated with a substantial deficit, and had revenues that only covered
30% of its expenses, one might have expected the tribunal to discuss whether the claimant’s
operation would have recouped the entirety of its investment costs, had Argentina not taken steps

to undermine its concession.

iii. | Tribunal Considers Commercial Prospect of Investment and either Adjusts
Compensation or Provides Justification for Awarding Full Investment Costs

772. Ina third category of cases, tribunals appear to have explicitly considered the question
of causation and on that basis, either correspondingly adjusted the investment costs ultimately
awarded to the claimant, or provided justification for an award of full investment costs. The

approaches in this respect, however, vary significantly among the relevant cases.

773. In some cases, the tribunals adjusted the award of investment costs. In MTD v. Chile,
for example, the tribunal held that Chile failed to accord the claimants fair and equitable treatment
by failing to rezone the land required for the claimants’ development project.'*!? Applying the
Chorzow Factory principle, the tribunal awarded damages on the basis of the claimants’
expenditures that were made for purposes of the investment, and that were incurred as a result of
Chile’s unlawful acts.'*"* The tribunal then proceeded to deduct the residual value of the
investment from this amount, and further reduced that amount by 50% to take account of the costs
related to the claimants’ own failure to exercise business acumen and diligence in purchasing the
site.'15

TTA. In Copper Mesa Mining Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador, the tribunal declined to
adopt either the market-based or income-based approach for purposes of calculating damages for
the expropriation of two of Copper Mesa Mining concessions in Ecuador because they were “too
uncertain, subjective and dependent upon contingencies, which cannot fairly be assessed by the
Tribunal.”'*'6 The tribunal considered this unsurprising given that the “Claimant’s concessions
remained in an early exploratory stage with no actual mining activities, still less any track record
as an actual mining business; and, particularly as regards the Junin concessions, that the
Claimant’s chances of moving beyond an exploratory stage were, by December 2006,
slender.”'*!” After further noting the “huge differences” in the valuation conclusions reached by

the two party-appointed experts and the various methodological uncertainties involved, the

tribunal concluded that the most “reliable, objective, and fair method in this case” was to assess
the proven historical expenditure made by the claimant in relation to the lost investment. '*'* The
tribunal, however, reduced the investment costs award pertaining to one concession by 30% on.
the basis of contributory negligence by the claimant which “substantially reduced its chances of
turning [that] concessions into a commercial success.”'4!? The implication of that statement would
appear to be that the tribunal believed that a substantial — albeit reduced — chance of commercial

success remained.

775. In other cases, the tribunal fully considered the matter of causation and provided a
justification as to why it regarded the full award of investment costs appropriate. For example, in
Caratube v. Kazakhstan (Caratube Il), the tribunal held that Kazakhstan had unlawfully
expropriated the claimants’ existing contractual rights, but rejected the claimants’ request for lost
profits on the grounds that they had “not convincingly established that CIOC was a going concern
with a proven record of profitability,” or that “CIOC would have become a going concern but for
the termination of the Contract.”'#?° Accordingly, the tribunal held that the claimants’ claim is
“most appropriately addressed by an award of sunk investment costs.” '?! In applying this

approach, the tribunal reasoned that:

[T]he purpose is to apply restitution to the measure of damages required to restore the
claimant to the position it held prior to the commission of the breach (to place it again in the
position as if the breach had not occurred, rather than in the position it would have been in
had the contract never been concluded). [...] Up until the breach, the sunk costs had been
spent with a view to some possible benefit. The breach deprived the claimant of the
possibility to obtain such benefit. In the present case, CIOC was unable to prove the latter,
either as lost profits or loss of an opportunity. However, because the breach deprived these
costs of their justification, that deprivation should be repaired.!*22

716. While Kazakhstan’s expert calculated the investment costs as the difference between
total expenditures and the revenues generated, the majority of the tribunal found that revenues did
not have to be deducted from the total amount awarded because “[i]t is undisputed that CIOC

reinvested into the Caratube project all of the revenues generated from trial production, and such

reinvestment also is part of CIOC’s investment.” 4” The minority arbitrator, however, maintained
that “deducting oil sales revenues from CIOC’s total expenditures is necessary so that the
compensation awarded does not exceed the damage CIOC actually incurred.”'** Despite this
difference within the tribunal, it would appear that the arbitrators had no doubt that Caratube’s

opportunity to explore and potential develop oil fields had a positive value.

777. In SPP v. Egypt, the tribunal found that Egypt had expropriated the claimants’
investment in a commercial development venture but rejected the claimants’ proposed DCF
analysis on the basis that “the project was not in existence for a sufficient period of time to
generate the data necessary for a meaningful DCF calculation.”'”* Instead, the tribunal awarded

the claimants all their out-of-pocket expenses, while specifically noting:

In the Tribunal’s view, however, it is incontestable that the Claimants’ investment had a value
that exceeded their out-of-pocket expenses. The record shows that between February of 1977
and May of 1978, ETDC made sales of villa sites and multi-family sites totalling
US$10,211,000—more than twice the Claimant’s out-of-pocket expenses. Moreover,
construction involving roads, water and sewage systems, reservoirs, artificial lakes and a golf
course had commenced and the design work for two hotels had been completed. In these
circumstances, the Tribunal cannot accept that the project did not have a value in excess of
the Claimant’s out-of-pocket expenses. '4?6

iv. Conclusions and Application to the Present Case

THB. By way of conclusion from the above summary of the case law, there does not appear
to have been any tribunal that has expressly declined to award investment costs on grounds of
lack of causation. On the other hand, there are good reasons for tribunals to ensure that a claimant,

through an award of sunk costs, cannot recoup more than the remaining value of its assets.

779. In the present case, while it is doubtful in view of the decline of the REEs prices whether
the Claimants’ investment would have become profitable in a short-term perspective, the
Claimants’ Licenses terminated by the Respondent did have a residual value in the 20 year-
perspective for the Licenses. The enquiry into the longer-term value of the Licenses proceeds

from a different premise than that concerning the short-term profitability of a company: the

question here is whether a hypothetical willing buyer would have perceived a business
opportunity in the Licenses, had it been offered to acquire them in October 2014. While such a
hypothetical buyer would have doubtlessly paid much less in October 2014, when REEs prices
were down, than in 2011, when REEs prices were high, it does not follow that it would have paid
nothing. Rather, a hypothetical buyer in October 2014 would have noticed that the longer-term
outlook for REEs production outside of China was uncertain. While no analysts’ reports are
available precisely at the valuation date, there are reports on the record of this case that were

as bleak even in the long run,'*”’ others projected a stabilization of the market and a recovery of

prices, albeit not “approaching the levels seen in late 2010 and early 2011”.'478

780. The Licenses were thus, in the Tribunal’s view, assets of interest to certain investors—
including mining companies and venture capital investors that were prepared to take the risk of
losing their investment in the event of continuously low REEs prices in exchange for the chance
of reaping a substantial reward in the event of a market recovery. With qualifications, the Tribunal

thus shares the view of the Claimants’ expert that there remained a market potential for REEs

deposits outside of China. '4”°

781. This residual value of the Licenses would seem to be confirmed by the Respondent’s
own conduct and tenders in 2016'4*° and 2017,'**! from which it can be inferred that the
Government did not consider the deposits to be worthless at a time relatively close to the valuation
date. In this context, since the tenders were unsuccessful, no conclusion is possible regarding the

actual value to be attributed as the Government set the minimum bid for the licenses at US$ 10

million and the 2016 tender was allegedly based on a government valuation of the Kutessay II
deposit (as opposed to any particular license), which resulted in a value of that deposit of US$
110 million,'*” to which Respondent has objected to it being given any significance.' Further,
the file does not provide information on the duration and other conditions of the licenses offered
in 2016 and 2017 (the extracts of the tender conditions and press release on the record do not
contain those details).'** It is therefore not clear to what extent the Claimants’ Licenses as they

stood in 2014 were comparable to what the Government tried to sell in 2016 and 2017.

782. In conclusion, it would appear that, it cannot be contested that the Claimants’ Licenses
terminated by the Respondent did have a residual value though that it cannot be exactly

determined what value either Party attributed to them at the time of the taking.

783. The Tribunal does not consider that an expectation of a profitability of the investment
has to be shown for the application of the sunk costs approach. Such an expectation may be
necessary for an application of the DCF method, but above, the Tribunal has found that method
not to be applicable for the present case. The sunk cost approach has been used exactly in cases

where tribunals have found the DCF method not to be applicable.

784. In view of the above considerations, the Tribunal considers that there is no reason why
it should not follow the approach found above in many decisions of comparable jurisdiction to
apply the sunk costs approach for calculating the damages to be awarded as a consequence of the

Respondent’s breach of the 2003 Investment Law.

b. Quantification of Sunk Costs

785. Regarding the amount of sunk costs in the present case, the Tribunal, in its Annex to

Procedural Order No. 9, invited the Parties to reply to the following Question 6:

Assuming that the Tribunal adopts a sunk costs approach on damages (consistently with the
Respondent’s submission in the alternative), what are the amounts expended by the

790. In the Parties’ Post Hearing Briefs, the evidence in support of a quantification of the
sunk costs award was addressed to some extent in response to the Tribunal’s Question 6 in

Procedural Order No. 9.

791. The Claimants addressed this question, in particular, in paragraphs 98 to 100 of their

£441

Post Hearing Brie and in paragraphs 54 to 56 of their Second Post Hearing Brief.'*” In turn,

the Respondent addressed this question, in particular, in paragraphs 85 to 89 of its Post Hearing

f 1443 fla

Brie! and in paragraphs 31 to 33 of its Reply Post Hearing Brie:

792. As stated by the Claimants in their Post-Hearing Brief: “Mr Dellepiane has calculated
the amounts invested by Stans Energy as of the relevant valuation dates indicated by the Tribunal
on the basis of Stans Energy’s financial statements already on the record, and two interim
financial statements for the years 2013 and 2014.”'“ This approach was criticized by the

Respondent on the basis that the Claimants would have purportedly failed to evidence and

particularise the amounts claimed.'**°

793. The Respondent’s first objection regarding the amount for the KRP (formerly known
as KCMP) cannot be accepted by the Tribunal. The Tribunal does not consider that this amount
should be excluded because that investment would not have been undertaken but for the larger

investment.

794. R ding the R dent’s second objecti ding the “overpayment” for the

Licenses, the Claimants are right in pointing out that the Kyrgyz Republic was entitled to set any

price it thought should be paid for Kutisay Mining OJSC and that Respondent has no basis in law

for deducting half the expenditures that the Claimants actually made at Respondent’s request

when acquiring their investments. '“7

795. The Tribunal also cannot accept the Respondent’s third objection concerning
expenditures incurred after the License Agreement expired or after the final deadline for the
submission of a TP under Kutessay II License Agreement No. 3. The Respondent never alleged
at the time that the Claimants were not in compliance with the Licenses, and in fact issued new
License Agreements while seeking a stake in Kutisay Mining LLC. The Claimants continued to
undertake expenditure on the Licenses to develop Kutessay II and Kalesay according to their
license obligations. The Respondent cannot now claim that these costs were “not legitimately

incurred”.

796. In its quantification of the sunk costs, at the outset, the Tribunal recalls that the
Claimants have the burden of proof for any sunk costs they claim. It is further recalled that, as
mentioned above, Procedural Order No. 9 expressly invited the Parties to address in their Post-
Hearing Briefs the assumption “that the Tribunal adopts a sunk costs approach on damages
(consistently with the Respondent’s submission in the alternative),” and sought their views as to
“what are the amounts expended by the Claimants by. .... (ii) 16 October 2014? What is the
evidence on the record that such expenditures were incurred?”. As the Parties have had the
opportunity to, and in fact did, respond to these questions in their Post-Hearing Briefs referring
to the evidence that they felt supported their positions, the Tribunal must therefore assume that
the evidence before it is the best evidence available to the Parties and proceed on the basis of the

evidence now on the record.

797. As the Claimants bear the burden of proof, and where doubts remain, the Tribunal
considers that the Claimants have not sufficiently fulfilled their burden of proof, and those doubts
are to be resolved in favour of the Respondent. The Tribunal is mindful of the risk of double-
counting expenditures identified in different documents form the basis for ascertaining costs
incurred. Again, using the same approach, uncertainties are to be resolved in favour of the

Respondent.

798. That said, various documents in the record make it clear that payments were made by
the Claimants. The Tribunal thus comes to the following evaluation of the evidence on

quantification of the Claimants’ sunk costs.

i, Valuation Based on Financial Statements

799. The first body of evidence reviewed by the Tribunal consists in the Financial Statements
of Stans Energy on the record (the “Financial Statements”). '“**
800. The Respondent does not dispute the veracity of the Financial Statements or the figures

recorded therein. However, it contends that the Financial Statements do not provide specific and

detailed information regarding Stans Energy’s sunk costs.'? The Tribunal agrees with the

 

Respondent but this does not mean that the Financial Statements are of no value. The Tribunal
considers that the Financial Statements are convincing and reliable evidence of expenditures
insofar as the Financial Statements provide sufficient detail to allocate a position to the
Claimants’ operation in relation to the Kutessay II and Kalesay Licenses in the relevant time

period.

801. The Financial Statements set out a number of categories such as current assets, property
and equipment, mineral properties, current liabilities and expenses.'**° Out of these categories,
only the mineral properties category, which expressly refers to the Kutessay II and Kalesay fields,
unambiguously relates to the investment expenditures of the Claimants in relation to the Licenses
that form the basis of the expropriation claim in the present proceedings. The Financial Statements

also provide figures regarding costs incurred by the Claimants in relation to the KRP (formerly

Nine Months of the Period Ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, 28 November 2014 (Exhibit C-328/R-521). The
figures found in the following interim reports were not taken into account in order to avoid double-counting: Stans

2011 (Exhibit R-41); Stans Consolidated Interim Financial Statements For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2013

known as KCMP). The Tribunal considers that these expenditures should also be included as the
purchase of the KRP (formerly known as KCMP) was closely linked to, and would not have
occurred but for, the acquisition by the Claimants of the Licenses. In particular, the Tribunal is
prepared to accept the Claimants’ statement that “[g]iven the Company's current inability to
Jurther develop its Kutessay II, Kalesay and other mineral properties and the inability to date to
identify a feasible alternate source of rare earth elements that could be processed at this facility,
it is expected that this Kashka will remain idle for an indefinite period.”'**' On the other hand,
the Tribunal did not include in its calculation the amounts paid pursuant to the KCMP Option
Agreement as it does not appear to be established that they represented any additional

disbursement since these amounts “were capitalized toward the future investment in KCMP”. '°?

802. The Tribunal has not taken the financial statements for the period ending in December

2014 (the “December 2014 Statements”) into consideration. While the December 2014

Statements contain certain additional expenditures, such as “additional expenditures expense of

$719,762 relating to the impaired Kashka Rare Earth Processing Facility, expenditures to
>> 1453

maintain the plant and for completion of technical reports and researches”, it is not

established that such additional expenditures were incurred prior to the valuation date.

803. Furthermore, while the Tribunal is satisfied that some of the amounts recorded under
other positions of the Financial Statements might also relate to the Claimants’ investments, the
Financial Statements do not allow the Tribunal to single out the relevant portion (or proportion)
of such other positions that can qualify as sunk costs. Hence, the Tribunal will have no account

of such positions for its calculation.

804. The table below provides a summary of the mineral properties and KRP (formerly
known as KCMP) figures related to the investment expenditures of the Claimants evidenced in

the Financial Statements.

See Stans Consolidated Interim Financial Statements For the Nine Months of the Period Ended September 30, 2014

do not encompass the entirety of the Claimants’ investment expenditures. Therefore, the Tribunal

ii. Valuation Based on the Information Reports

807. Among the documents in evidence, the Information Reports submitted by the Claimants
for the years 2010 and 2012 (the “Information Reports”)'*® are particularly relevant. Even
though the Information Reports do not have the same statutorily mandated character, and are not
subject to the same audits, as the Financial Statements, the Tribunal is prepared to consider the

expenditures recorded therein prima facie correct as long as they are not contradicted by other

evidence.'“°!

808. Further, the Tribunal notes that the Information Reports were submitted by the

Claimants to the competent Kyrgyz regulatory authority seeking approval of the work programs

1462

contained therein. '*°* Hence, the Information Reports constitute formal documents comparable to

regulatory filings. Moreover, though some tensions with the Respondent were already felt, the
Information Reports were prepared at a time when the Claimants continued to proceed with their
operations. For this reason, it cannot be said that the Information Reports were prepared in
contemplation of litigation. This sets them apart from evidence produced in connection with the

present proceedings, such as the witness statements submitted by the Claimants.

809. The Tribunal is mindful of the fact that the 2013 Work Program contained in the 2012
Information Report was rejected by the SAGMR on the basis that the 2013 Work Program was
not supported by Technical Plans and Expert Reports.'*°* However, in the Tribunal’s view, the

refusal of Kyrgyz regulatory authority to approve the 2013 Work Program does not call into

See Information Report on Works Performed in 2010 and Programme of Work for 2011 at the Kutessay II Field, 30
January 2010 (Exhibit C-214) (the “2010 Information Report”); Information Report on Works Performed in 2012
and program of work for 2013 at the Kutessay II field, January 2013 (Exhibit C-234) (the “2012 Information
Report”).

In contrast, future projections or plans mentioned in the Information Reports, which merely indicate an intention to
make an expenditure, will not be taken into account by the Tribunal since there is no assurance that these planned
expenditures were actually made.

Whether the Information Reports were submitted to the Kyrgyz governmental authorities in pursuance of an obligation
under the Licenses is a matter contested between the Parties. See, for instance, Statement of Claim, at paras 126-128;
Statement of Defence on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction, at paras 321-326, 394, 665.3; Reply to the

question the reliability of the Information Reports for the purposes of determining the Claimants’

sunk costs.

810. The table below provides a summary of the most relevant figures outlined in the

Information Reports.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Field Description of expenditure Amount
Kalesay Cumulative operational costs in 2010! KGS 6,470,000
Kutessay II Total cost of Kutisai Mining in 2010-2012 for the KGS 403,800,000

of pre-project and design work
Kutessay II eae exploration of deep horizons and flanks in KGS 35,357,000
Kutessay II Taxes and payments in 2012'7 KGS 3,729,097
Kutessay II Charitable assistance in 2010-20124 KGS 9,040,000
Total KGS 458,396,097

 

 

 

 

811. Of these items, the amount of KGS 35,357,000 is explained on page 10 of the Report
as follows: “35.357 million soms were spent on the additional exploration of deep horizons and
flanks.” In the view of the Tribunal, it is not sufficiently clear or explained that this amount of
KGS 35,357,000 is not already included in the amount of KGS 403,800,000 provided earlier on
page 6 of the same report by the following explanation: “The total costs of "Kutisai Mining" LLC
in 2010-2012 of the implementation of pre-project and design work for the Development Project
of the Kutessai II field at the design stage amounted to 403.8 million soms.” (emphasis added) In
view of the Claimants’ burden of proof, these KGS 35,357,000 are therefore not accepted as sunk
costs and the resulting total is KGS 423,039,097.

812. On the other hand, the Tribunal is aware that a valuation of the Claimants’ sunk costs

solely based on the Information Reports would not encompass the entirety of the Claimants’

2010 Information Report, at p. 5 (Exhibit C-214),

2012 Information Report, at p. 6 (Exhibit C-234). The Tribunal notes a discrepancy in the 2012 Information Report
with regard to the total costs of the Kutessay II development project at the design stage for 2012. While it is provided
at page 9 that the total costs of the Kutessay II development project at the design stage for 2012 amounted to KGS
74.19 million, a figure of KGS 53.841 million is found at page 11 of the same document. (“The total costs of the
Kutessai II development project at the design stage for 2012 reached 74.19 million soms.”/“The total costs of the
Kutessai IT development project at the design stage in 2012 amounted to 53.841 million soms.”) [emphasis in original].
Since the Claimants bear the burden of proof, the Tribunal will assume the lower figure — of KGS 53.841 million — to
be true. Moreover, in order to avoid double-counting, the Tribunal will assume that this figure is already included in
the total cost of “Kutisay Mining” LLC for the period 2010-2012 included in the table above.

investments. Indeed, the Information Reports do not contain detailed information regarding the
costs incurred by the Claimants in relation to their investments for the years 2009, 2013 and 2014.
Moreover, the 2012 Information Report does not discuss the Kalesay field and focusses solely on
the Kutessay II field. Finally, some expenditures are not included in the Information Reports due
to their nature. Insofar as expenditures are not documented in the Information Reports, the

Tribunal consults other documents on the record.

iii. | Valuation Based on Other Documents in the Record

813. Having thus consulted other documents on the record, the Tribunal finds that there are
few expenditures of which it can say with sufficient confidence that they are not already recorded
in either the Financial Statements or the Information Reports. The record shows that the Claimants
paid US$ 8,635.50 in relation to a broker fee with regard to the acquisition of Kutisay Mining
OJSC at auction.'*” This broker fee was not reflected in the mineral properties category of the
2009 Financial Statements, as the amount recorded in that category for 2009 is C$ 924,883,
composed of the purchase price of Kutisay Mining OJSC (C$ 898,524) and legal fees (C$ 26,359).
Nor would the broker fee have been reflected in the 2010 and 2012 Information Reports, as it was

already incurred in 2009.

814. Beyond that payment, the Tribunal was unable to identify any further expenditures that
were sufficiently supported by evidence on the record and in respect of which it can say with
confidence that they are not already included in the Financial Statements or the Information
Reports. Amounts were notably disregarded in the calculation of the total amounts invested by

the Claimants in Kutessay II and Kalesay for the following reasons.

Mandate Agreement No 26/12-1 between Stans Energy Kg LLC and Ak Tilek Investment LLC, 26 December 2009, at
p. 2 (Exhibit C-212). (“The Broker's fee for the performance of this mandate [acquisition of Kutisay Mining OJSC at
auction] shall be 0.5 per cent of the amount of the Securities transaction completed in the Exchange's trading system at
the bidding [0.5% of US$ 863,550 is US$ 4317.75]. The Broker's fee shall include all charges of the Exchange and.
costs of the Registrar.”); Central Asian Stock Exchange CJSC announcement of public auction of shares in Kutisay
Mining OJSC, at p. 2 (Exhibit C-155). (“Additional charges: brokerage fee to the broker representing the Fund in the
amount of 0.5% of the total amount of the securities transaction in accordance with the auction results [0.5% of US$

815. First, certain amounts were merely asserted within a witness statement without any
further documentary support. This is the case of the amount of KGS 750 million allegedly

representing the total cost of taxes paid with respect to Kutisay Mining LLC.'*”°

816. Second, certain amounts were asserted in a letter from the Claimants to the
Respondent’s governmental authorities without further documentary support or by reference to
supporting documents that do not form part of the record. This is the case with the amount of
US$ 345,893 related to the total expenditures for Kalesay for the period 2010-2011.'4"' Similarly,
the Tribunal did not take into account in its calculation the alleged amounts of US$ 8.7 million

and US$ 10 million related to aggregate expenditures on implementation of the project to develop

1472

the Kutessay II deposit at the design stage for the period 2011-2010 and 2012 respectively.
Furthermore, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants did not discharge their burden of proof in
relation to the amount of C$ 468,000 allegedly incurred in relation to the execution of their
contract concluded with Asiarud.'4” Likewise, the Tribunal did not include in its calculation the
amount of US$ 328,931 allegedly incurred by the Claimants in relation to the contracts concluded
with Tien-Shan Gold LLC, Tien-Shan Ltd., the IT Research Centre and others.'4 A similar
approach was adopted with regard to the amount in excess of US$ 9 million allegedly incurred
during the period 2010-2011 in relation to predesign, design, surveying at Kutessay II and Kalesay

as well as the acquisition and reconstruction of the KCMP. '4’> The Tribunal would note, however,

Tribunal considers that the amount of US$ 1-2 million that the Claimants planned to spend on the
“supplementary exploration of deep horizons and flanks” of the deposit for the period of May
2012-December 2014 should not be included in its calculation.'**° Likewise, the anticipated cost

expenditures that form part of that category of costs. The proceeds of the private placement in
relation to which the broker fee was incurred, according to Stans Energy’s own press release,
were to “be used for a feasibility study on Kutessay II and Kalesay, purchase of the KCMP Rare

fee formed part of the costs of ”the implementation of pre-project and design work” already

accounted for in the Information Report.

820. Finally, the Tribunal did not include in its calculation of the Claimants’ sunk costs the
amount of KGS 19,086,468 paid in relation to taxes and bonuses payments for the Kutessay II
and Kalesay Licenses in accordance with respective License Agreement No. 1. It appears from
the evidence provided that the payment of these bonuses/taxes did not require any additional
disbursements by the Claimants further to Stans Energy’s purchase of Kutisay Mining OJSC. '4*7
While some uncertainty remains, the Tribunal thus regards it as possible, and indeed likely, that

such payment would have been indirectly reflected in the Financial Statements.

iv. Conclusion on Valuation

821. The Tribunal accordingly finds that, according to the Financial Statements, the
Claimants’ sunk costs amount at a minimum to C$ 4,017,823 and US$ 5,500,000. Furthermore,
the Information Reports record the Claimants’ expenditures at a minimum of KGS 423,039,097.
To avoid any risk of double-counting, the Tribunal will take the most reliable information it has

for a particular time period and category of expenditures.

822. In particular, the Tribunal is mindful of the fact that both the Financial Statements and
the Information Reports record costs incurred by the Claimants for the period 2010-2012. For this
period, the Tribunal prefers the more detailed record of expenditures incurred in the Information
Reports. Therefore, the Tribunal will adopt for purposes of its calculation the amount of

KGS 423,039,097. For the years 2009, 2013 and 2014 (until the valuation date), the Tribunal will

rely on the amounts recorded in the Financial Statements in relation to the Kutessay II and Kalesay
Licenses of a total of C$ 2,044,502. The same goes for the amount of US$ 5,500,000 recorded in
the 2011 Financial Statements in relation to KCMP. To these amounts should be added the
expenditure for the broker fees of US$ 8,635.50, not accounted for in the Financial Statements

and Information Reports.

823. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied on the basis of the evidence before it that the
Claimants’ investment in relation to the Kutessay II and Kalesay Licenses amounted to at least
C$ 2,044,502, KGS 423,039,097, and US$ 5,508,635.5. When the former two amounts, recorded
in C$ and KGS, are converted to US$ pursuant to the exchange rates of 0.8877 and 0.01821 as of
16 October 2014 (the day before the SAGMR terminated the Licenses),'*** the amounts are
USS 1,814,904.43 and US$ 7,703,541.96.

824. As a result of the review of evidence on the record, the Tribunal concludes that the
Claimants have fulfilled their burden of proof for sunk costs showing investments by them in the
acquisition and development of the Licenses in the amounts of US$ 1,814,904.43,
USS 7,703,541.96 and US$ 5,508,635.50 established above. The Tribunal therefore awards the
total amount of US$ 15,027,081.89 to the Claimants as compensation.

REDUCTION OF DAMAGES

825. The Tribunal now turns to the Respondent’s contention, disputed by the Claimants, that
damages should be reduced to take into account the fact that the Licenses were due to be

terminated as well as the Claimants’ contributory fault.

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

826. The Respondent alleges that the damages should be reduced because: (1) “the Licenses
were liable to be terminated”;'*° and (2) the Claimants engaged in “wilful or negligent acts or

omissions” contributing to the injury.'4°

827. The Respondent asserts that investment treaty tribunals “have consistently affirmed the

 

position that when assessing damages, it is necessary to consider the nature and scope of an

investor’s rights” as this affects its entitlement to future profits and the amount that a third party
would be willing to pay for the investor’s rights.'4°' The Respondent recalls its argument that
Kutisay Mining LLC consistently failed to fulfil the requirements imposed by the License
Agreements, such that the Licenses were liable to termination. '? Thus, the Respondent
concludes that “[a]s at 1 April 2013, Kutisay had no right to a further license agreement, nor to
keep its license in respect of the Kutessay II and Kalesay deposits [...] the Licenses were
worthless before the Republic took any action to terminate them”.'"°

828. The Respondent argues that, should the Tribunal agree that the Claimants’ alleged loss
was a direct consequence of the Claimants’ conduct, “including its active participation in efforts
to circumvent the tender requirement in the Subsoil Law and persistent non-compliance with the
terms of the License Agreements”, the Tribunal should not award damages at all.'*°

829. Finally, in the event that the Tribunal finds that the Claimants suffered losses as a result

awarded should be reduced, pursuant to Article 39 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, to

alleged bribery and corruption; (2) the Claimants’ lack of due diligence when purchasing the

Licenses; and (3) their persistent breaches of the License Agreements. '*°* The Respondent
submits that the reduction should be of 75% taking into account the facts established at the

hearing,

including C[laimant]s’ deliberate ignorance and complete lack of due diligence, and that
C[laimant]s obtained the Licenses and agreed to the terms of the license agreements in full
knowledge that they had no intention or ability to comply."

THE CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

831. The Claimants allege that there is no basis for reducing damages due to their
conduct.'*° At the outset, the Claimants note that the Respondent relies on general international
law, rather than Kyrgyz law, thereby undermining its own position on the law applicable to the
substance of this arbitration. '*°' The Claimants also reiterate their position that the Licenses were
not subject to termination for the reasons described above, and that any risk in this regard related
to the Claimants’ performance was entirely reflected in the stock market price of Stans Energy on

25 June 2012.'°

832. Regarding the allegation that the Claimants engaged in “wilful or negligent acts or
omissions” by participating in bribery and persistently violating the License Agreements, the
Claimants argue that this has nothing to do with the legal concept of contributory fault, which
requires that the extent of the harm be increased by the victim’s conduct. '*°? The Respondent does
not actually allege that the Claimants’ conduct has increased the resulting harm but merely
reiterates its arguments on jurisdiction and the merits.'°** The Claimants’ conduct played no part
in the termination of the Licenses.'** In any event, not every act that contributes to damages
qualifies as “contributory fault” and the Respondent has not proved or attempted to prove the

commission by the Claimants of any “wilful” or “negligent” (i.e. unreasonable or imprudent)

acts, '506

833. The Claimants also argue that the Respondent does not provide any basis for such a
substantial reduction of damages, not having proved that the Claimants’ conduct caused the
invoked percentage of their loss and note that in Yukos v. Russia, where the Tribunal found

“material and significant misconduct”, damages were only reduced by 25%.'*°7

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

834. The Tribunal cannot agree with the Respondent’s arguments for a reduction of any
damages award due to (1) the seriousness of the alleged bribery and corruption; (2) the Claimants’
lack of due diligence when purchasing the Licenses; and (3) their persistent breaches of the

License Agreements.'*°*

835. Regarding the first argument, the Tribunal recalls its finding above that no bribery or
corruption, for which the Respondent would bear the burden of proof, can be attributed to the

Claimants.

836. Regarding the second argument, the Tribunal recalls its earlier finding that no lack of
due diligence by the Claimants in purchasing the Licenses has been found, but, rather, it has been
concluded that the process of granting the Licenses occurred under the full control of the

Respondent and that the Respondent’s termination of the Licenses in 2014 was unlawful.

837. Regarding the third argument, the Tribunal recalls its finding above that the Claimants’
conduct in implementing the Licenses played no part in the termination of the Licenses, as the
SAGMR’s termination notice and the court decisions it relied on did not refer to such conduct

and only focussed on the alleged illegality of the procedure granting the Licenses.

INTEREST

838. The Tribunal now addresses the question concerning the applicable interest rate and

how it should be applied to the amount of compensation quantified in Section VII.C.3.b.iv.

THE CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

839. The Claimants consider that the interest rate provided for in Article 6(3) of the 2003
Investment Law only applies in the case of lawful expropriations and that there are no provisions

concerning the interest rate applicable to unlawful expropriations or other forms of unlawful

conduct.'5

840. Hence, the Claimants contend that the principle of full reparation applicable under
general international law to the calculation of damages should also be applied to the calculation

of interest.!*'° In particular, it should inform the appropriate interest rate, whether interest is

simple or compound, and the periods of compounding. '*!!

841. The Claimants allege that Stans Energy is entitled to both pre-award interest applied

from the valuation date (25 June 2012) to the date of the Award, and post-award interest on the

full amount of damages awarded by the Tribunal.'*!

842. The Claimants argue that the interest rate should be a suitable commercial rate,
equivalent to the return which Stans Energy would have earned had it been able to invest the
funds of which it has been deprived.'*'? According to the Claimants, the interest rate should be
15.5% on the basis of the best proxy available, namely the WACC of Stans Energy pursuant to
the calculations of the independent market analysts Visor Capital on a report issued on 21 June

2012.'5"* In contrast, the award of a risk-free interest rate, as advanced by the Respondent, is said

to ignore commercial realities. '5'°

843. The Claimants also assert that interest should accrue on a compounded basis so as to

fully reflect the time value of the Claimants’ losses and to ensure full reparation under customary

international law.'*'° They refer to several cases in which the award of compound interest was
defined as the default solution.'°!’ In particular, the Claimants allege that a commercially

reasonable approach would be to compound both pre- and post-award interest semi-annually.'*'*

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

844. The Respondent asserts that the interest rate should be the twelve-month LIBOR
pursuant to the express provision within Article 6(3) of the 2003 Investment Law. '*! The
Respondent reiterates that this formula remains applicable to all expropriations as the 2003
Investment Law makes no distinction between “lawful” and “unlawful” expropriation and, in any
event, to the extent that the Claimants’ investments were expropriated, the Respondent acted

lawfully.'°7°

845. The Respondent also asserts that there is no justification to depart from the interest rate
specified in Article 6(3) of the 2003 Investment Law, as this rate is consistent with the one used
by numerous investment tribunals in practice, and there is an economic rationale behind the

granting of a risk-free rate.'**! Even if Article 6(3) were not formally applicable, it provides the

best guidance on an appropriate interest rate in this case.”

846. The Respondent notes that the Claimants attempt to obtain interest on the basis of the
returns that they “hoped” to achieve by seeking an interest rate of 15.5% on the basis of Stans
Energy’s WACC.'*3 The Respondent argues that it would be inappropriate to award interest on
this basis, particularly because the Claimants have never demonstrated that they were able to
obtain such returns on their capital.'*** Moreover “[i]nvestment treaty tribunals have consistently

rejected the use of WACC, or similar measures, as a basis for awarding interest”. !5?5

847. The Respondent asserts that “any interest should accrue on a simple rather than a

compounded basis”'**6

and avers that the Claimants have not established any entitlement to
compound interest in a claim brought under the 2003 Investment Law.'*?’ In any event, even
international law has traditionally “frowned upon” the award of compound interest. The
Respondent considers that the Tribunal should approach with caution a recent trend towards the
grant of compound interest by investment tribunals, which “is by no means universal. Numerous
tribunals have awarded simple interest [...] [a]s explained by the International Law Commission:

‘the general view of courts and tribunals has been against the award of compound interest’”.'°?8

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

848. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the interest rate provided for in Article 6(3)
of the 2003 Investment Law only applies in the case of lawful expropriations and that there are
no provisions concerning the interest rate applicable to damages for unlawful expropriations or
other forms of unlawful conduct.!*” In the present case, the principle of full reparation applicable
under general international law to the calculation of damages should also be applied to the

calculation of interest. '**°

849. The principle of full reparation also implies that Stans Energy is entitled to both pre-
award interest applied from the valuation date (which the Tribunal has found to be 16 October
2014) to the date of the Award, and to post-award interest on the full amount of damages awarded
by the Tribunal.'**! Guidance can be taken from the principle of restitutio ad integrum under
international law as reflected in Art. 38 of the ILC Articles, which states: “Jnterest on any

principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when necessary in order to ensure full

reparation. The interest rate and mode of calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.”

850. Regarding the rate of interest, the principle of full reparation also implies that it should
be a suitable commercial rate, equivalent to the return which Stans Energy would have earned
had it been able to invest the funds of which it has been deprived.'** In view of the considerably
later evaluation date, the Tribunal doubts that, as submitted by Claimants, the interest rate should
be 15.5% on the basis of the best proxy available, namely the WACC of Stans Energy pursuant
to the calculations of the independent market analysts Visor Capital on a report issued on 21 June
2012.'S* On the other hand, the Tribunal also doubts that a risk-free interest rate, as advanced by
the Respondent, can be applied and would reflect commercial realities.'**5 Rather, the Tribunal
considers that taking into account publicly available information regarding the average rate for

small business lending in Canada, the rate of 5% should be applied in the present case.

851. The Claimants assert that interest should accrue on a compounded basis so as to fully
reflect the time value of the Claimants’ losses and to ensure full reparation under customary
international law.'*° They refer to several cases in which the award of compound interest was
defined as the default solution.'**’ As no guidance is provided by Kyrgyz law for unlawful
expropriation, the Tribunal agrees that, in accordance with the standard practice in recent
investment arbitration, '*** pre-award interest on the amount of US$ 15,027,081.89 should be
compounded annually from 16 October 2014 until the date of the present Award, and post-award
interest on the full amount awarded should be compounded annually from the date of the present

Award until the date of payment.

these arbitration proceedings.

ALLOCATION OF COSTS

the Claimants’ legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the

Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, and the administrative costs of the PCA.'*°

costs of legal representation, fees and expenses of the appointing authority and expenses of the
Secretary General of the PCA, and all other professional fees, disbursements and expenses, plus

interest thereon. '*“°

855. The Parties’ submissions concerning allocation of costs are summarized in the

following paragraphs.

1. Applicable Legal Principles

856. The Parties partly disagree with regard to the legal provisions that are relevant for this

question.

a. The Claimants’ Position

857. The Claimants rely on Articles 38 and 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules.'*! The Claimants

858. According to the Claimants, the principle that the unsuccessful party bears the costs is
“consistent with the general practice of tribunals in investment arbitrations[.]”!**? The Claimants
argue that to “deny the successful party recovery of costs incurred pursuing its case would have
the effect of denying that party’s ‘full reparation’ as required by international law”.!*** It is the
1545

Claimants’ position, relying on Philip Morris vy. Australia, and Luigiterzo Bosca v.

Lithuania;'** that this principle is not affected by the amount of damages that might be eventually
awarded by the Tribunal. '*“”

859. The Claimants note that “the Tribunal retains the discretion to apportion costs in what
it considers a reasonable manner taking into account the circumstances of the case.”'** However,
the Claimants assert that “[a] different apportionment of costs is appropriate only in exceptional
circumstances, taking into account a party’s conduct during the proceedings.” '*”

860. The Claimants aver that the Parties agree on the relevant principles applicable to the
allocation of costs which are found in the UNCITRAL Rules.'**° The Claimants contend that the
provisions regarding costs in the 1996 Arbitration Act, referred to by the Respondent, are not
mandatory.'**! In the Claimants’ view, such provisions do not apply to the present arbitration as

the Parties chose the UNCITRAL Rules. '**?

b. The Respondent’s Position

862. The Respondent asserts that pursuant to the English Arbitration Act 1996, “the Tribunal

may determine by an award the recoverable costs of the arbitration on such basis as it thinks

fit. Ps

863. The Respondent argues that the general rules for the allocation of costs is that “costs
should follow the event”, except in exceptional circumstances.'*°° The Respondent avers that this
general rule is reflected in Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules and in Section 61(2) of the English

Arbitration Act; '%*7 which, the Respondent argues, are in accordance with the consistent

jurisprudence requiring that the successful party “should be made whole[.]”!***

864. Furthermore, the Respondent contends that:

[iJn addition to overall success, tribunals have taken into account factors such as: (i) the
quantum of the claim; (ii) the overall conduct of the arbitration; (iii) the complexity of the
facts and law in issue; (iv) whether claims advanced were untenable or frivolous; (v) the
failure to meet deadlines and other procedural misconduct; and (vi) the relative quality of
submissions and the importance of the case to each side.'5

In sum, the Claimants’ position is that “the entirety of the costs of this arbitration falls to be paid

by the Kyrgyz Republic.”

866. Accordingly, the Claimants dispute the Respondent's position that even if they succeed
on all or part of their claim there would be reasons to depart from the presumption that costs
follow the event. Similarly, the Claimants disagree with the Respondent’s contention that the
Claimants should be ordered to bear part of the Respondent’s costs even if it loses the case due to
the Claimants’ purportedly “unreasonable behaviour” '* (see section below, for the

Respondent’s position on this issue).

867. Among others, the Claimants argue that the arbitration before the MCCI did not concern

the same dispute insofar as it did not deal with breaches of the 2003 Investment Law.'°°5

868. With regard to the Respondent’s decision not to claim costs in respect of the witness
evidence provided by Mr. Beysheyev, the Claimants aver that such decision would confirm that
the allegations of fraud and corruption are not related to the Claimants and their investment (given
that the evidence was prepared in a prior arbitration) and, in any event, such decision cannot

justify a departure from the principle that costs follows the event.'°°°

869. In the Claimants’ view, the issues concerning the translation of certain Russian terms

to English were:

the Respondent’s own creation [...,] were over-simplistic and irrelevant to whether the
Claimants had complied with the License Agreements. Moreover, the Respondent never
challenged the Claimants’ translations in accordance with Section 16.4 of Procedural Order
No 1. In these circumstances, there is no reason to depart from the principle that costs follow
the event. '°°7

870. Furthermore, the Claimants deny having raised any frivolous arguments nor to have
abandoned any claims.'°** Similarly, the Claimants submit that their conduct with regard to

procedural issues was “universally proper” and did not cause “significant additional costs”.'*°

871. In contrast, the Claimants argue that the Respondent’s procedural conduct should
“reinforce the Claimants’ entitlement to recover all of their costs, should they prevail on
liability.”!5”° In the Claimants’ view, the Respondent “has pursued a calculated strategy of

inflicting maximum financial harm on the Claimants[.]”!5”!

872. In particular, the Claimants contend that the Respondent’s pursuit of jurisdictional
objections and bifurcation of proceedings had the purpose of delaying adjudication on the merits
and, in any event, the Respondent should bear the costs of the bifurcated proceedings. '°

873. Likewise, the Claimants assert that the Respondent initiated set aside proceedings
against the Tribunal’s Award on Jurisdiction before the High Court of Justice of England and
Wales in an attempt to further delay this arbitration. '*7

874. The Claimants also refer to what they consider as a “frivolous” request for security for
costs by the Respondent,'*” and to the Respondent’s refusal to bear its share of any of the advance
payments in this proceedings. '*7°

875. Furthermore, the Claimants argue that the Respondent “has consistently displayed a
disregard for procedural rules, needlessly compounding the costs incurred[.]”!*”° Specifically, the

Claimants refer to the Resp s in extensive

pond regarding the

merits of the Parties’ document production requests, and the “extremely late” filing of the Witness

Statements of Mr. Shilov and of Mr. Antonenko.'*””

876. According to the Claimants, the above-mentioned conduct reinforces the principle that
they are entitled to recover all their costs if they prevail on liability and “[flor the same reason, in

the event the Respondent should prevail on jurisdiction or liability, the Claimants should not bear

1379

costs of the bifurcated proceedings and of its application for security for costs.
877. Moreover, the Claimants argue that even if they are awarded less damages than claimed,
there would be no reason to depart from the principle that costs follow the event as they would
still be the successful Party in the arbitration.'**°

878. The Claimants also contest the Respondent’s contention that they should be awarded
no costs if damages were to be awarded following the market capitalization approach unless Stans
Energy’s cash balance is deducted, claiming that the Respondent “conflates two entirely separate
concepts”. '°*! Furthermore, according to the Claimants, they “bore significant expenses in
relation to the arbitration, not all of which are recoverable as costs under the [...] UNCITRAL

Rules.”582

b. The Respondent’s Position

879. The Respondent argues that, if it wins on the merits, costs should follow the event and
the Respondent’s costs should be awarded “in full, including in respect of the jurisdiction
phase.”!**>

880. According to the Respondent, it should be reimbursed in full and the amount of
Respondent’s costs is reasonable considering the length of the proceedings, the nature of the
allegations raised by the Claimants, and the amount claimed by the Claimants. '°**

881. Additionally, the Respondent requests reimbursement in full on the basis of the
following “additional factors”: (1) the “purely speculative” nature of the Claimants’ claim; (2)
the fact that this is said to be the second arbitration commenced by the Claimants in relation to
the same dispute (the first one before the MCCI); (3) the fact that a significant portion of the

Respondent’s costs in relation with the witness evidence offered by Beysheyev has not been

claimed (as a significant portion of his witness statement was prepared in a prior arbitration); and

(4) the “significant additional costs” incurred due to the Claimants’ behaviour. '**°

882. As illustration of “significant additional costs” allegedly incurred due to the Claimants’
behaviour, the Respondent refers to: (1) the Claimants’ contention that they had complied with
the License Agreements (which required the Respondent to address this matter at length “on the
basis of complex evidence and investigations, with the assistance of Kyrgyz counsel and of certain
members of SAGMR”); (2) the Claimants’ application to exclude the Expert Witness Statement
of Shilov; (3) the disagreement about the translation of certain Russian terms to English; (4) the
allegedly “unsubstantiated allegations [...] including spurious allegations of a conspiracy between
the Respondent and Baotou”; (5) the Claimants’ failure to produce documents subject to

production orders; (6) the Claimants’ “repeated flout[ing]” of procedural rules; and (7) the
“Claimants insiste[nce] on a market capitalisation approach as the only appropriate valuation
method in this case, [... which] forced the Respondent and its valuation expert to deal with
additional damages calculations and submissions in its post-hearing briefs, at the Tribunal’s

791586

request in PO9.

883. Accordingly, the Respondent requests, pursuant to Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules,
that the Claimants be ordered to pay in full the fees of the Tribunal and of the PCA and to
reimburse the Respondent’s costs; as well as interest on all amounts from the date of the award

at the rate of 6% compounded annually. '**”

884. Moreover, the Respondent disputes the Claimants’ allegation that, even if the
Respondent prevails on jurisdiction or liability, the Respondent’s costs should not be awarded.
The Respondent contends that it “complied with the procedural rules and took no improper steps
in this arbitration.”'*** In particular, the Respondent argues that (1) its jurisdictional objections
and request for bifurcation of proceedings were legitimately raised; (2) its request for security for

costs was justified; (3) its decision not to pay the advance of costs “is not a relevant factor in the

apportionment of costs under the applicable rules”, and (4) it did not disregard procedural
rules. 5%

885. In the event that the Claimants succeed on all or part of their claim, the Respondent
argues that there are reasons to depart from any presumption that costs follows the event.'*" The
Respondent’s position in such case is that “at least, the parties should bear their own costs, and
further submits that the Claimants should be ordered to pay those of Respondent’s costs which it

occasioned by [the Claimants’] unreasonable behaviour,” !**!

some purported instances of which
have been set out above. The Respondent avers that its “best estimate of the additional costs
caused by the Claimants’ behaviour is around 20% of its total costs.”!°*

886. Furthermore, in the event that the Claimants succeed on liability but the Tribunal awards
no damages, the Respondent contends that it should be awarded its costs in full considering that
the Claimants would be “substantively the ‘unsuccessful party’ within the meaning of Article 40

of the UNCITRAL Rules.”!°?

887. The Respondent considers that the Claimants’ assertion that the quantum of damages

awarded does not affect the principle that costs follow the event is contradicted by “established

jurisprudence”,'*™ relying on the findings in Copper Mesa Mining Corporation v. Republic of

Ecuador,'*** and in Chevron Corporation (U.S.A.) and Texaco Petroleum Corporation (U.S.A.)
v. Republic of Ecuador.'*°° Moreover, the Respondent recalls that the Tribunal “retains a

discretion to apportion the costs between the parties, regardless of which party is deemed

‘successful’ [,]”!**” referring to Philip Morris v. Australia.'°°*

888. Likewise, in the event the Tribunal awards an amount of damages lower than claimed
by the Claimants, the Respondent argues that it should be awarded its costs due to the significant
time and resources devoted to valuation issues or, in the alternative, that “the Respondent should
be awarded its costs in proportion to the relative success of the Claimants in its claim for
damages.”!**? According to the Respondent, even if the Tribunal were to find the Claimants to be
the “successful party” in such circumstances, it would be justified to depart from the presumption
that the unsuccessful party should bear the costs. '°”

889. In the event that the Claimants are awarded any damages on the basis of the market
capitalization approach, and “contrary to the Respondent’s submissions, Stans Energy’s cash
balance is not deducted from Stans Energy's market capitalisation on the valuation date, then the

1.7 1601

Claimants should be awarded no costs at all The Respondent argues that any cost award

would result in double recovery given Mr. Dellepiane’s affirmation in his supplemental report
that Stans Energy’s cash balance was “eventually used for arbitration-related expenses[.] °°

890. In the event that the Claimants are awarded damages following the sunk costs approach
based on Mr. Dellepiane’s calculations, the Respondent contends that they should be awarded no
costs because such calculations “are based on operating expenditures stated in Stans Energy’s
consolidated financial statements, which already include legal costs [...] any costs award would

amount to double recovery.” !?

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis
891. Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides in relevant part as follows:

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by
the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs
between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the
circumstances of the case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38,
paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be
free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the
parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.

892. Using the discretion accorded by Article 40, the Tribunal takes into account in
particular: the Respondent failed in its objections to jurisdiction both in the first phase of the
bifurcated procedure and in its objections examined in the second phase, and the respective parts
of the proceedings caused a considerable part of the total costs of arbitration. The Claimants
succeeded on liability which caused also a considerable part of the total costs of arbitration, but
in quantification only for an amount of US$ 15,027,081.89 of damages of the total requested
amount of US$ 128.23 million.

893. In view of these considerations, the Tribunal finds it appropriate that the Respondent

shall bear two thirds of the costs of arbitration and of the Claimants’ costs of legal representation.

AMOUNT OF COSTS OF ARBITRATION
1. The Claimants’ Position

894. As noted above, the Claimants request that the entirety of the cost of this arbitration
“falls to be paid” by the Respondent.'™ In particular, the Claimants argue that a comparison
between their costs for legal fees and expenses and those of the Respondent is not appropriate in

assessing the reasonableness of such costs, among other reasons, given the burden of proof.'°°>
895. The Claimants seek reimbursement of the following costs:

19. For the above reasons and pursuant to Articles 38 and 40 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules,
the Claimants seek reimbursement of:

(a) its and the Respondent’s portions of PCA and Tribunal advances that the Claimants has
paid (Article 38(2)(a), (b), and (f); see Appendix A below);

(b) costs associated with expert advice (Article 38(2)(c); see Appendix A below);

(c) travel costs and other expenses of the Claimants’ witnesses and representatives (Article
38(2)(d) and (e); see Appendix A below);

(d) legal costs reasonably incurred (Article 38(2)(e); see Appendices A and B below and
Appendix C of the Claimants’ First Submission on Costs); and

(c) other costs incurred in relation to the arbitration, particularly compensation paid to
witnesses to prepare for the arbitration (Article 38(2)(e); see Appendix A below). '®

21. Accordingly, the Claimants request that the Tribunal:

(a) ORDER that the Kyrgyz Republic reimburse the Claimants for the following fees and
costs, plus interest from the date at which said costs were incurred until the date of payment
by the Kyrgyz Republic:

(i) US$4,060,295.07 and US$41,340.00, which correspond to legal fees and
disbursements of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP and Interlex respectively;

(ii) €1,150,000.00, which corresponds to the advances on the costs of the Tribunal and
the PCA made by the Claimants;

(iii) US$605,150.69, which corresponds to the fees and expenses of the experts (Compass
Lexecon and SRK);

(iv) CAD24,708.21, €7,010.44 and US$45.00 in party expenses;

(b) ORDER the Kyrgyz Republic to reimburse any additional amounts incurred by the
Claimants in relation to its legal representation or in relation to the fees and costs of the
Tribunal and of the PCA between the date of the present submission and the date of the final
award; and

(c) AWARD any other relief it may deem appropriate.'”

2. The Respondent’s Position

897. The Respondent seeks full reimbursement of its costs.'°* The Respondent agrees with
the Claimants’ assertion that a comparison between the Parties’ costs is inappropriate and avers
that, although its costs are slightly higher, they are reasonable and should be awarded in full.'%°
In particular, the Respondent refers to the allegations of bribery and corruption, over which the
Respondent had the burden of proof, and contends that it had to develop “extensive investigations
and had to deal with these issues extensively in its pleadings.”'°! Likewise, the Respondent
argues that it “was also forced to show that the Claimants had failed to comply with their

obligations.”!6!!

898. The Respondent’s request for an award of costs is as follows:

24, Pursuant to Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Respondent therefore requests:

24.1 That the Claimants be ordered to pay in full the fees: (i) of the Tribunal (including
travel and other expenses incurred by the Arbitrators); and (ii) of the PCA;

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

900. By letter dated 2 November 2015, the PCA, on behalf of the Tribunal, requested the
Parties to establish a deposit of EUR 400,000 (EUR 200,000 from each side) to assure sufficient

funds for the initial phase of the proceedings.

901. By letter dated 19 November 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it
respectfully declined to pay for the deposit, arguing that this was the second arbitration which the
Claimants had sought to commence in reliance on Article 11 of the Moscow Convention and
Article 18.3 of the 2003 Investment Law, the first award having been set aside on the grounds
that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction. The Respondent argued that it had incurred significant
costs in the set-aside proceedings in Russia as well as in proceedings in Ontario, where Stans
Energy sought to enforce the award. None of these costs were compensated by the Claimants in
full or in part. Moreover, according to the Respondent, there was a significant risk that in the
event of an award of costs in these proceedings against the Claimants, they would be unable to

pay on such award, and the Respondent would be unable to recover its past or future costs.

902. On 26 November 2015, the PCA acknowledged receipt of the Respondent's letter dated
19 November 2015. The PCA confirmed receipt of an amount of EUR 200,000 from the
Claimants, representing the Claimants’ share of the initial deposit. By letter dated 30 November
2015, the PCA, on behalf of the Tribunal, requested, pursuant to Article 41(4) of the UNCITRAL
Rules, that the Claimants made a substitute payment of EUR 200,000 in lieu of the Respondent

by 22 January 2016 in order to allow the arbitration to proceed.

August 2017, in order to ensure sufficient funds to cover the fees and expenses of the Tribunal.
On 22 August 2017, the PCA acknowledged receipt of an amount of EUR 250,000 from the
Claimants, representing the Claimants’ share of the supplementary deposit in the present

905. By letter dated 21 September 2017, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it
respectfully declined to pay its share of the supplemental deposit, explaining that the Kyrgyz
Republic had limited budgetary resources and had a history of investors routinely failing to meet

costs awards made against them.

906. By letter dated 22 September 2017, the PCA, on behalf of the Tribunal, requested that,
pursuant to Article 41(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules, in order to allow the arbitration to proceed,

3 November 2017. On 16 October 2017, the PCA acknowledged receipt of an amount of EUR
250,000 from the Claimants, representing a substitute payment by the Claimants of the

supplementary deposit requested.

907. By letter dated 22 August 2018, the PCA, on behalf of the Tribunal, requested the
Parties to make a supplemental deposit of EUR 250,000 (EUR 125,000 from each side) no later
than 21 September 2018.

908. On | October 2018, the PCA confirmed receipt of an amount of EUR 125,000 from the
Claimants, representing the Claimants’ share of the supplementary deposit requested on 22
August 2018. The Respondent was invited to confirm whether its share of the deposit might be

expected in the near future.

previous correspondence.

911. By letter dated 31 October 2018, the PCA, on behalf of the Tribunal, requested that,
pursuant to Article 41(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules, in order to allow the arbitration to proceed,
the Claimants made a substitute payment of EUR 125,000 in lieu of the Respondent by
30 November 2018.

912. On 5 December 2018, the PCA confirmed receipt of a substitute payment of
EUR 125,000 from the Claimants in lieu of the Respondent in accordance with Article 41(4) of
the UNCITRAL Rules.

913. By letter dated 27 May 2019, the PCA, on behalf of the Tribunal, requested the Parties
to make a final supplementary deposit of EUR 100,000 (EUR 50,000 from each side) by
17 June 2019.

914. On 18 June 2019, the PCA acknowledged receipt of an amount of EUR 50,000 from
the Claimants, representing the Claimants’ share of the supplementary deposit. The PCA also
noted that the Respondent’s share of the supplementary deposit remained outstanding and
requested the Respondent to inform the PCA by 21 June 2019 as to the status of the payment of

its share. No response was received from the Respondent in respect of this request.

915. By letter dated 27 June 2019, the PCA, on behalf of the Tribunal, requested that,
pursuant to Article 41(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules, in order to allow the arbitration to proceed,
the Claimants make a substitute payment of EUR 50,000 in lieu of the Respondent by 15 July
2019.

916. On 16 July 2019, the PCA confirmed receipt of a substitute payment of EUR 50,000
from the Claimants in lieu of the Respondent in accordance with Article 41(4) of the UNCITRAL
Rules.

917. Therefore, total deposit payments amount to EUR 1,250,000, all of which have been
paid by the Claimants.

918. In accordance with Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976, the Tribunal
fixes the costs of arbitration pursuant to sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (f), which have been

covered from the case deposit established with the PCA, as follows:

Arbitrator fees (EUR)

The Honourable Colin L. Campbell, Q.C. 175,500
VAT 22,815

Mr. Stephen Jagusch, Q.C. 215,100
Professor Karl-Heinz Béckstiegel 512,300
Registry fees of the PCA (EUR) 175,056.06
Expenses (EUR)

Arbitrator expenses 25,216.36

General expenses (hearing room rental, court 61,457.94
reporting, audio-visual technology, catering,
courier and other expenses)

Total (EUR) 1,187,445.36

919. The difference of that amount with the total of deposits paid by Claimants is therefore
EUR 62,554.64, which shall be reimbursed by the PCA to the Claimants.

920. According to the above conclusion on allocation of costs, the Respondent shall

reimburse the Claimants two thirds of the costs of arbitration, i.e. EUR 791,630.24.

921. Further, the Tribunal finds the costs of legal representation and assistance claimed by
