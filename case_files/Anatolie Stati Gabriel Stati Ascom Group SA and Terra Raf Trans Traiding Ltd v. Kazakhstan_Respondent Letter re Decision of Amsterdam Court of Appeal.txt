Re: Anatolie Stati, et al. v. Republic of Kazakhstan, No. 18-7047
Dear Mr. Langer:

Pursuant to D.C. Cir. R. Rule 28(j), appellant Republic of Kazakhstan
(“Kazakhstan”) informs the Court that on November 6, 2018, the Amsterdam
Court of Appeal in the Netherlands (the “Dutch Court”) issued the attached
decision (“Decision”), in which it granted Kazakhstan the opportunity to
substantiate its fraud claim following disclosures of further documents by the Stati
Parties.! The decision means that the Dutch Court will not render a judgment on
the Stati Parties’ application to enforce the arbitral award without an in-depth
examination of all evidence supporting Kazakhstan’s allegations that the award
was obtained by the Stati Parties’ fraud on the Tribunal. See Decision {fj 2.15-
2.23.

The Dutch Court’s decision was issued after written submissions by the
parties (including a “statement of defence with exhibits” by Kazakhstan) and an
extensive oral hearing on June 22, 2018. Jd. § 2. The decision is based on the
parties’ respective allegations and counter-allegations (not evidence), id. 4] 2.21,
and the court set a February 5, 2019 date for Kazakhstan to make further written
submissions on its fraud defense, and ordered that the oral hearing would resume
thereafter. Id. § 3.

1 Attached is a certified English translation and the original Dutch decision
dated November 6, 2018.

The fraud defense the Dutch Court will examine is the same one that the
district court in this case declined, in erroneous reliance on the doctrine of futility,
to permit Kazakhstan to present. See Opening Br. 45-56; Reply Br. 19-27. The
decision below therefore stands in stark contrast not only to the decision of the
English High Court, see Opening Br. 16-18, Reply Br. 23 & n.8, but also to the
Dutch Court’s present determination that the arbitral award at issue cannot be
enforced under the New York Convention without a full examination of
Kazakhstan’s allegations of fraud and the extensive evidence relevant to those
allegations.

Sincerely,
/s/ Jonathan S. Franklin
Counsel for Appellant
