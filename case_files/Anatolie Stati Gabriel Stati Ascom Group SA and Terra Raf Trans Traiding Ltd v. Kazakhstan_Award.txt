C.___ Short Identification of the Case
1. The short identification below is without prejudice to the Parties’ full presentation
of the factual and legal details of this case, and the Tribunal’s considerations and
conclusions.
C.I. | The Claimants’ Perspective

2. Claimants summarize the main aspects of the dispute at C-I {{f[ 2— 24 and C-II qf 1
- 31, partially quoted and summarized below; CPHB | {{[ 2 — 42, CPHB 2 {fff 1 — 8:

2.

[...] In reliance on Kazakhstan's solemn commitments under international
law, Claimants invested more than US$ I billion breathing new life into
previously-neglected oil and gas fields, and constructing a state-of-the art
LPG Plant that Kazakhstan itself described as having “great regional and
industrial importance for development of the region.” But just as those
investments matured and began to generate returns, Kazakhstan launched
a targeted campaign of intimidation and harassment designed to pressure
Claimants into selling their investments to the state-owned oil company at
a firesale price. Kazakhstan went so far as to imprison a senior KPM
employee on patently bogus criminal charges, and to threaten other
employees with the same fate, in furtherance of its strong arm tactics.
When its plan failed — because Claimants defiantly refused to give in to
Kazakhstan’s pressure — the government simply seized the investments,
deciding to take its chances in arbitration.

Perhaps most shocking, this plan originated from the highest level of the
Kazakhstan government, namely, President Nazarbayev himself. That fact
would sound far-fetched if it were not admitted, but Kazakhstan concedes
that President Nazarbayev personally issued the order that led to the
expropriation of Claimants’ investments.

[...] Kazakhstan attempts to shroud its violations of international law in a
cloak of legitimacy by focusing on each minute detail in isolation rather
than the totality of its conduct as a whole. It argues that its extraordinary
campaign of inspections was perfectly normal, and that its subsequent
actions were appropriate responses to the information it discovered under
arcane, Delphic, and often-misstated provisions of its own domestic law.
These arguments, however, crumble under the weight of the evidence.
Kazakhstan did not discover any wrongdoing by Claimants’ companies,
much less violations that would justify the extraordinary actions that
followed. Viewing Kazakhstan’s conduct in its entirety, it is evident that
Kazakhstan’s objective from the start was to devalue Claimants’
investments by making it virtually impossible for Claimants to operate or
sell the businesses, so that Claimants would sell to Kazakhstan at a
firesale price. Moreover, Kazakhstan also anticipated this arbitration
from the beginning, and cloaked its actions under mystifying
interpretations of domestic laws and regulations in order to create an
appearance of normalcy and legitimacy.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 12 of 415

Page 11 of 414

Furthermore, Kazakhstan has continued its blatant disregard for its
obligations under international law in its conduct of this arbitration.
Kazakhstan consistently attempts to obstruct this Tribunal’s consideration
of Claimants’ claims by raising utterly baseless arguments, flatly
misstating facts and law, and engaging in procedural misconduct of the
worst kind. [Kazakhstan hopes that through the sophistry of focusing on
each small fact individually, the Tribunal will lose sight of the fact that
Kazakhstan launched the investigations for the precise purpose of
acquiring Claimants’ investments for less than fair value.] (C-II {J 2 — 5,

7). [on]

Moreover, while Kazakhstan publicly maintained that it would honor its
earlier contracts, its practice has been quite to the contrary. [...]
Kazakhstan has become adept at pressuring foreign investors to sell equity
stakes to KazMunaiGaz through a combination of Financial Police
investigations, baseless criminal allegations, fines, and tax threats.
Kazakhstan makes it essentially impossible to continue normal operations,
and then makes it known that the sale of a substantial equity stake to
KazMunaiGaz would resolve the company’s various legal difficulties.
Kazakhstan has run this “playbook” on foreign investors — and
especially, investors in 100% foreign-owned projects — time and again.
[That is precisely what happened here. And when Claimants’ refused
Kazakhstan’s below-average bid for Claimants’ investments, Kazakhstan
turned up the pressure. After six months of government harassment, they
offered USD 150 million less. This is the Kazakhstan playbook to the
letter.] (C-I 1] 15 - 16). [...]

Moreover, when Claimants rejected KazMunaiGaz’s lowball offer in June
2009, Kazakhstan simply turned up the pressure. It interfered in the trial
of Mr. Cornegruta to ensure a guilty verdict, then sentenced him to four
years in Kazakhstan's notoriously dangerous prison system as punishment.
It continued to threaten the same fate for KPM and TNG’s other directors.
It engineered a massive fine against KPM (which was not even a party to
the criminal trial) that was large enough to bankrupt the company and
provide a ground for seizing its assets. And it continued to interfere with
the day-to-day operations of the businesses, including more inspections
and audits, asset seizures, and apparent interference with TNG’s access to
gas markets that choked the company’s cash flows. Then, in November
2009, KazMunaiGaz made another bid to buy the companies, this time
attempting to circumvent the Claimants by negotiating with the
companies’ note-holders, and then offering even less to the Claimants than
it had offered in June 2009.

Despite all this, Claimants continued to resist Kazakhstan's coercion, and
ultimately found a Kazakhstan-based buyer for the companies. In
February 2010, Claimants signed an agreement to sell their Kazakhstan
investments to the Cliffson company for more than US$ 920 million —
which was nearly 70% higher than KazMunaiGaz’s lowball offer in June
2009. And that presented a dilemma for Kazakhstan. Cliffson was owned
by the wealthy and politically connected Assaubayev family. In the course
of those negotiations, it became clear to all involved (and no doubt to

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 13 of 415

30.

Page 12 of 414

Kazakhstan as well) that Claimants intended to bring arbitration claims
against Kazakhstan once the sale closed for the diminution in the sale
price caused by Kazakh ’s ISS ipai: Thus, Kazakh
faced the prospect of either allowing the companies to slip out of its hands
or exercising its pre-emptive rights (which would have required it to match
Cliffson’s offer), while still facing arbitration claims for the diminution in
value. Kazakhstan delayed approval of the transaction for several months
with requests for additional details and documentation, but Claimants
submitted everything the Government requested in June 2010. Within a
week, on June 29, 2010, Kazakhstan launched the final inspection blitz
that led to the outright seizure of the companies on July 21, 2010.
Kazakhstan apparently concluded that if it was going to face arbitration
claims anyway, it might as well take the assets for free and posture a
termination basis for the coming arbitration fight. (C-II J 18).

 

This tale of conspiracy coordinated at the highest levels of government
might seem contrived if it were not both a familiar pattern of behavior in
Kazakhstan and admitted in this case that President Nazarbayev was
personally involved. But viewed in the context of all the facts, this is a far
more plausible explanation than Kazakhstan’s suggestion that this was
just the normal operation of law in Kazakhstan. Only Kazakhstan knows
precisely why it chose this path: a favor to a regional ally, punishment for
a 100% foreign-owned company that had refused purchase overtures in
the past, an old-fashioned money grab, or some combination of all three.
But it is beyond serious dispute that it occurred. [And, Kazakhstan's own
documents and admissions in this proceeding confirm that it did. (C-II 11
19—20)]. [...]

[In these proceedings, Kazakhstan’s] conduct goes beyond zealous
advocacy in a contentious arbitration. [Kazakhstan has delayed
proceedings, unfairly and obstructionistically submitted evidence, and has
made meritless jurisdictional objections.] Kazakhstan seeks to obscure the
truth from this Tribunal and make it as costly, time-consuming, and
difficult as possible for Claimants to obtain justice, in furtherance of its
strategy of harassment and intimidation. Indeed, if Kazakhstan can bully
or mislead this Tribunal into an award favoring Kazakhstan — or even an
award for Claimants that undervalues damages — then Kazakhstan will
have accomplished its objective of seizing Claimants investments for less
than fair value, and also can discourage other foreign investors from
resisting its coercion in the future based on hope of obtaining redress in
arbitration. (C-II {J 22 — 30).

3. Prior to the Hearing on Quantum, Claimants summarized the main aspects of the
dispute at C-III {ff 1-7, partially quoted and summarized below:

1.

[...] Kazakhstan’s harassment campaign had as its principal objective a
devaluation of Claimants’ investments in an effort to acquire them for far
less than their fair market value. Kazakhstan saddled KPM and TNG with
unfounded liabilities, interfered with the companies’ cash flows, and
obstructed the sale of the companies, all as part of its strategy to force
Claimants to sell to KazMunaiGas at a firesale price. When that strategy

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 14 of 415

CII.

Page 13 of 414

failed, Kazakhstan seized the investments, deciding to take its chances in
arbitration.

Respondent has continued that strategy in this arbitration, making a series
of disingenuous arguments about the value of Claimants’ investments in
an effort to enlist the Tribunal in accomplishing the objective Respondent
could not accomplish in negotiations with Claimants — namely, acquiring
Claimants’ investments for far less than their actual worth. In summary,
Kazakhstan argues that the value of Claimants’ investments as of October
14, 2008 (the valuation date used by Claimants) was significantly less than
Claimants calculate; that Claimants’ investments were of de minimis value
by the time of their final seizure in July 2010; and that, between October
2008 and July 2010, “there are other possible causes of a reduction in the
value of the Claimants’ investments that cannot possibly be attributable to
the Republic and may even be attributable to the Claimants.”

Respondent purportedly arrives at a range for the total market value of
Claimants’ investments, as of its chosen July 21, 2010 valuation date, of
US $161 to US $237 million on an enterprise value basis (i.e., without
considering debt). To arrive at this exceedingly low value, Respondent
fabricates capital costs, overstates operating costs, ignores existing
reserves, fabricates artificially low gas prices, attributes no value at all to
five of the six resource areas at issue in the Contract 302 Properties,
relegates the LPG Plant to scrap value, and ignores entirely any attributes
of the investments that would be of uniquely enhanced value to the State
itself.

The Respondent’s Perspective

4. Respondent summarizes the main aspects of the dispute at R-I fj 2 e seg., and R-II
ql 1 —9, RPHB 2 {{{[ 1 — 3, 59 partially quoted and summarized below:

1.

[...] A claimant raising claims must state and prove his case. Stating one’s
case means that the claimant must present to a tribunal a complete,
plausible and logical factual story without contradictions. Proving one’s
case means that the investor must prove that the tribunal has jurisdiction
to hear the case and that the applicable treaty was breached by the state.
The claiming investor must further prove causation, [...][i.e.] that he
incurred damages as a result of such breach. And finally the claiming
investor must prove and specify the precise amount of the damages he
requests the tribunal to award based on a certain valuation date which
also needs to be correctly determined by the claiming investor. [...]

[...] [The]need for the claimant to fulfil its procedural duties cannot be
replaced by mere reference to an alleged discretion of a tribunal. A
claimant may not simply anchor the highest possible value and the earliest
valuation date he could think of and leave it to the tribunal to award a
portion of this maximum threshold established by a claimant. Rather, any
claimant must submit a specified request for damages based on specific
and proven facts. A claimant must further establish a causal link between
the alleged breach by a respondent and the requested damages. And this

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 15 of 415

59.

Page 14 of 414

must be linked to a specific date for the valuation of the damages
requested. Once the claimant has done so, he is bound by the choices he
made as to facts, causation, amount requested and valuation date. Equally,
the tribunal is bound by those choices and bound to verify whether the
claimant has discharged its various procedural duties. Where this is not
the case, the tribunal cannot put its own discretion to cover up for
claimant’s failure. Rather, if a claimant fails in any of the mandatory steps
required of a claiming party, his claim must also fail. [...]

Claimants have in many instances failed to coherently state their case.
Where they did present a coherent set of factual allegations, they generally
failed to provide proof of their contentions: Their witnesses are non-
credible, many of their documents are tainted with procedural misconduct,
and their experts lack independence as well as the competence necessary
to provide useful opinions on valuation issues. The latter is evidenced not
least by Claimants’ ever changing prayers for relief. Ultimately, all of this
does not matter, as Claimants have not presented a_ valuation
corresponding to the facts of this case and the timing of the alleged
breaches of the law. In summary, Claimants’ claims must be dismissed
(RPHB 2 1] 1 -3, 59).

Anatolie Stati is a Moldovan businessman [who] [...] claims to have
acquired two relativley minor oil and gas companies in Kazakhstan, KPM
and TNG. The mechanism of the supposed acquisition and holding of these
companies is opaque, involving multiple intermediate entities outside
Kazakhstan, some disclosed others not.

The rationale for this complex holding structure is unknown, but liabilities
seemed to gravitate to KPM and TNG from their owners and their owner's
afiliates, whilst cash flowed out to a number of afiliated companies outside
Kazakhstan.

Tristan Oil, a BVI registered entity has no disclosed stake in KPM or TNG,
but since the end of 2006, it has issued over half a billion dollars in debt,
ostensibly for the purpose of funding KPM and TNG. Whilst KPM and
TNG are apprently guarantors of this debt, it is by no means clear that they
benefited from all of the funds this brought into Tristan Oil. As a BVI
registered entity Tristan Oil does not benefit from the protection of the
ECT.

In late 2008, when at a domestic level the Republic began to become aware
of problems with KPM and TNG, it seems that KPM and TNG’s precarious
debt laden ownership structure was pushed to the brink by the financial
crisis, resulting in yet more funds being stripped from the companies.

In late 2008 little of the above was known to the agencies of the Republic
that regulated the performance of KPM and TNG. At that time their
principal concern was a littany of breaches by KPM and TNG of their
contractual and other legal obligations. There were also wider social
consequences for the area in which the companies operated, caused by
what, at the time, seemed an inexplicable decline in the companies’
performance and indiference of their management.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 16 of 415
Page 15 of 414

6 The Republic was ultimately driven to terminate KPM and TNG’s contract
contracts and place their subsoil use assets into trust management to
preserve them from decay. That was not the outcome that anyone wanted,
least of all the Republic, which generates much of its income from active
subsoil users. However, KPM and TNG’s apparent disinterest in
remedying their desructive poor performance made it unavoidable.

7 Since this Arbitration was commenced, the Republic has learned rather
more about KPM and TNG and Mr Stati, though perhaps not enough fully
to explain the decline of KPM and TNG. However, what it has learned has
re-inforced its view that fundamentally the Claimants are seeking to use
international arbitration to shield them from the consequences of their
wrongdoing in Kazakhstan and perhaps from matters outside Kazakhstan
as well.

8 In the Republic’s respectful submission, the Tribunal should not allow its
power to be abused either to protect the Claimants from the Republic's
legitimate reaction to KPM and TNG’s illegal conduct or from the
apparent wider troubles of Mr Stati’s buiness empire in which the Republic
plays no part.

9 In dealing with this case, the Tribunal should keep four basic points in
mind:

(a) First, the Claimants’ illegal and bad faith conduct already
excludes any protection under the ECT and any jurisdiction of the
Tribunal. A foreigner breaching the laws of a state cannot expect
protection under international law. Conversely, a state making
promises in the expectation of (i) lawful investor conduct, (ii)
mutual cooperation and (iii) mutual profiting of both the state and
the investor from the investment cannot be held to such promises
when the investor acts illegally and contrary to the purposes of
admission of foreign investment.

(b) Second, Claimants claims are in any event completely without
merit. Claimants suggest that they fell victim to a “harassment
campaign” initiated by the President of the Republic for the
purpose of expropriating the Claimants’ assets and that this
“harassment campaign” was based on a “Kazakhstan playbook”.
These are mere pretty words with which Claimants try to turn the
case on its head. Claimants, as foreign subsoil use contractors in
Kazakhstan, were not respecting the laws that Kazakhstan had
enacted in order to safeguard its interests and ensure its subsoil
use policies. The Republic’s audits, inspections and investigations
were the lawful reaction to Claimants’ illegal conduct. This is not
harassment but the legitimate measures any state in the position of
the Republic would have taken.

(c) Third, Claimants are trying to blame the Republic for the demise of
their companies, when it was in fact the Claimants’ own conduct,

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 17 of 415

Page 16 of 414

as well as external circumstances, which made the Claimants’
project companies KPM and TNG fail in the end. Claimants
overburdened KPM and TNG with debt. This approach backfired
when the global financial crisis hit the markets in 2008, energy
prices took a dive and important local customers of KPM and TNG
could no longer fulfil their contracts with Claimants. Yet, in this
severe situation, instead of supporting the companies, Claimants
decided to strip them of cash even more. The ultimate failure of the
companies can come as no surprise against this background.

(d) Fourth, Claimants also largely overstate the importance of their
alleged investment within the Republic. Claimants’ activities were
of a rather minor scale compared to many other exploration and
production projects in the Republic. This has two consequences:
For one, this further undermines Claimants’ spurious allegation of
a “harassment campaign” initiated by the President of the
Republic. Apart from all other reasons excluding this argument,
Claimants’ assets were simply not valuable enough to merit such
action in the first place. Moreover, this also shows that Claimants’
claim for compensation is artificially inflated. In fact, Claimants
claim for compensation runs into billions, a sum which no
interested third party ever offered to pay for KPM and TNG.

5. Prior to the Hearing on Quantum, Respondent summarized the main aspects of the
dispute at R-III {{[ 1 — 12, partially quoted and summarized below (citations
omitted):

[T]he billions of USD claimed by Claimants in this arbitration, are
reached by a blatant breach of universally accepted valuation standards.
Moreover, they are reached by simply disregarding a whole range of
inconvenient facts and substituting reality by wishful thinking. [...]

The largest part of Claimants’ damages claim is taken up by the claim
relating to Contract No. 302. Claimants demand a whopping USD 1.58
billion in compensation for the “loss of opportunity” to develop the
Contract 302 Properties. However, as even Claimants’ expert confirms,
the chances of success were minimal and this must be reflected in the
valuation. [Claimants disregard risk in their valuation.] [...]

The central element of Claimants’ wishful thinking approach is Claimants’
improperly early valuation date. Claimants set their valuation date to 14
October 2008, a date on which no state action had any actual effect on
KPM and TNG and, moreover, a date which is months or even more than a
year prior to many of the state measures Claimants complain of. By
choosing 14 October 2008 as their valuation date, Claimants find a way to
disregard many developments after that date[,] which drive down the value
of their assets. In particular, Claimants ignore the sharp drop in oil prices,
the sharp drop in demand for TNG’s gas[,] and the failure to conclude the
so-called tri-partite agreement with KazAzot. Taking into account these
developments, as international law requires, Claimants’ claims shrink
decisively.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 18 of 415

Page 17 of 414

There are also other instances throughout Claimants’ case on damages in
which Claimants completely disregard the existing facts or the legal

framework surrounding KPM and TNG. For example, Claimants ignore

that KPM and TNG were never able to export gas because they could not
secure a contract for export. Claimants simply apply export prices — even
though their own reserves reports from 2008 and 2009 reveal that at the
time of events, they did not actually expect that they would be able to
achieve export prices.

Ina final attempt at inflating their damage claims, Claimants demand the
compensation of moral damages in the amount of “at least” 10% of
compensatory damages awarded. Since Claimants inflated damage claim
comprises approximately USD 2.7 billion, their moral damages claim thus
amounts to at least USD 270 million. This further inflation of Claimants’
claim borders on the ridiculous as is reflected by the fact that the highest
amount of moral damages ever awarded by an investment tribunal was
USD I million. (R-II {{ 1 — 12, partially quoted).

D. Procedural History

On 26 July 2010 Claimants filed of their Request for Arbitration (C-0) and
appointed Mr. David R. Haigh, QC of Canada as arbitrator. (C-0 {| 112).

On 23 September 2010, Arbitration Institute of the SCC appointed Prof. Sergei
Lebedev as an arbitrator.

On 28 September 2010, Prof. Karl-Heinz Béckstiegel accepted his appointment as
Chairman of the Tribunal.

On 10 November 2010, the Chairman, on behalf of the Tribunal, issued his first
email to the Parties and the Tribunal members, inviting the Parties to prepare for an
in-person procedural meeting and to inform the Tribunal as to when and where to
hold that meeting.

Respondent’s then-counsel, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP, advised
that it had been retained on 8 November 2010 but had only received the file on 12
November.

On 22 November 2010, the Chairman, on behalf of the Tribunal, sent the Parties
an Annotated Preliminary Agenda of Issues Regarding the Further Procedure
in preparation for the First Procedural Meeting with the Parties in Stockholm,
scheduled for 15 December 2010.

On 2 December 2010, Respondent challenged the 23 September 2010 appointment
of Prof. Sergei Lebedev as arbitrator. Respondent argued that, especially in light of
the necessary translation issues and the fact that the arbitration involves a State as
Respondent, the 21 and even 35-day time limits within which Respondent was to
have filed its Answer were exceptionally short — even shorter than would have
been demanded in a commercial arbitration. Respondent also noted that a member
of the SCC Board is a Consultant in the King & Spalding firm, which is
representing Claimants in this case, and indicated that this fact raises concerns
about the undue haste. Respondent indicated that it has been prejudiced and that
procedural fairness has been impaired by the hasty appointment.

On 15 December 2010 and after considering comments from the Parties, the
Arbitration Institute of the SCC dismissed Respondent’s challenge of Prof.
Lebedev, having found no ground for disqualification.

On 20 December 2010, the Chairman circulated the draft Procedural Order 1 (PO-
1), which resulted from the First Meeting in Stockholm, to the Parties for their
comment by 3 January 2011.

On 27 December 2010, Respondent wrote to the Secretary General of the
Arbitration Institute of the SCC, expressing disappointment with the Decision of 15
December and noting that no explanation had been provided for the decision.
Neither the SCC nor Claimants’ comments addressed whether Ms. Margrete
Stevens of King & Spalding participated in any way in the consultations regarding
the selection or appointment of Prof. Lebedev. Respondent again protested Prof.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 20 of 415

20.

Page 19 of 414

Lebedev’s appointment and argued that “the SCC’s own rules do not prescribe a
specific time period for filing an Answer and appointing an arbitrator, and the
short time given by the SCC was unreasonable and constitutes clear procedural
unfairness.” Re ined that the i of governmental
procedures required. due consideration in the setting of time limits. Respondent
maintained its objections and indicated that it participates in these proceedings in
good faith and with full reservation of all of its rights, defenses, and objections.

The Arbitration Institute of the SCC responded by letter dated 29 December 2010
and stated that Ms. Margrete Stevens, a member of the SCC Board, did not take
part in the decisions made by the SCC Board on this case.

On 3 January 2011, Claimants wrote to the Tribunal, indicating that they had no
comments to the draft procedural order. They made two comments related to
potential jurisdictional objections by Respondent and requested that the Tribunal
“clarify that, in the event Kazakhstan elects to make a jurisdictional objection, 1) it
must do so in its Counter-Memorial, and 2) if Kazakhstan submits a reply on its
jurisdictional objection in its Rejoinder, Claimants will be entitled to submit a brief
rejoinder, on jurisdictional issues only, on 10 May 2012 (i.e., 30 days after receipt
of Kazakhstan's Rejoinder).”

On 3 January 2011, Respondent submitted comments to the draft procedural
order, objecting to calling the second week of the hearing an “extension.” In
response to Claimants’ email of 3 January 2011, Respondent objected to any
limitations on its right to assert jurisdictional objections. Respondent also objected
to Claimants’ request for an additional round of briefing on jurisdictional issues,
explaining that Claimants had “opposed bifurcation and agreed to the briefing
schedule discussed at the December 15 meeting, fully aware that Respondent
contemplated asserting jurisdictional objections. There is no reason to alter that
arrangement.”

In a second email on 3 January 2011, Claimants stated that they are merely
seeking to ensure that both Parties have an equal opportunity to address
jurisdictional objections and indicated that the issue of bifurcation had not been
entirely decided at the meeting. Claimants then stated that, since the Tribunal had
indicated that there would be no bifurcation, it would be appropriate to address the
schedule for jurisdictional submissions.

On 12 January 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (PO-1) The
operative text is provided below for convenience:

Procedural Order regarding further details of the Hearing inviting
comments from the Parties.

Within 3 weeks later, at a date set by the Tribunal after

8.2.

Page 24 of 414

In order to make most efficient use of time at the Hearing, written
Witness Statements shall generally be used in lieu of direct oral
examination though exceptions may be admitted by the Tribunal.
Therefore, insofar as such witnesses are invited by the presenting
Party or asked to attend the hearing at the request of the other
Party, the available hearing time should mostly be reserved for
cross-examination and re-direct examination, as well as for
questions by the Arbitrators.

9 Expert Evidence

Should the Parties wish to present expert testimony, the same procedure
would apply as for witnesses.

10. Hearing

Subject to changes in view of the further procedure up to the Hearing:

10.1.

10.2.

10.3.

10.4,

10.5.

10.6.

10.7.

The dates of the hearing shall be as given in the Timetable above.

The hearing shall be held in Paris. (See Art. 20(2) SCC Rules)
The chairman of the Tribunal will proceed with making
appropriate reservations and then inform the Parties regarding

Jurther details and steps to be taken.

The Parties may present short opening statements of not more than
two hours, unless decided otherwise by the Tribunal after
receiving an application in that respect from a Party.

No new documents may be presented at the Hearing unless
authorized in advance by the Tribunal. This also applies to
documents regarding the credibility of a witness or expert. But
demonstrative exhibits may be shown using documents submitted
earlier in accordance with the Timetable.

Taking into account the time available during the period provided

for the Hearing in the Timetable, the Tribunal intends to establish

equal maximum time periods both for the Claimants and for the
Respondent which the Parties shall have available. Changes to
that principle may be applied for at the latest by 25 April 2012.

A live transcript shall be made of the Hearing. The Parties, who
shall share the respective costs, shall try to agree on and make the
necessary arrangements in this regard and shall inform the
Tribunal accordingly two months before the time set for the
Hearing, i.e. 23 May 2012.

Should the Parties be presenting a witness or expert not testifying
in English and thus requiring interpretation, they are expected to
provide the interpreter unless agreed otherwise. Should more than
one witness or expert need interpretation, to avoid the need of

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 26 of 415

21.

Page 25 of 414

double time for successive interpretation, — simultaneous
interpretation shall be provided. The Parties, who shall share the
respective costs, shall try to agree on and make the necessary
arrangements in this regard and shall inform the Tribunal
accordingly two months before the time set for the Hearing, i.e. 23
May 2012.

i. Extensions of Deadlines and Other Procedural Decisions

11.1. Short extensions may be agreed between the Parties as long as
they do not affect later dates in the Timetable and the Tribunal is
informed before the original date due.

11.2. Extensions of deadlines shall only be granted by the Tribunal on
exceptional grounds and provided that a request is submitted
immediately after an event has occurred which prevents a Party
from complying with the deadline.

11.3. The Tribunal indicated to the Parties, and the Parties took note
thereof, that in view of travels and other commitments of the
Arbitrators, it might sometimes take a certain period for the
Tribunal to respond to submissions of the Parties and decide on
them.

11.4, Procedural decisions will be issued by the chairman of the
Tribunal after consultation with his co-arbitrators or, in cases of
urgency or if a co- arbitrator cannot be reached, by him alone.

11.5. In view of the expected volume and complexity of the file in this
procedure, the Tribunal may appoint an Administrative Secretary.
The Tribunal will inform the Parties of such an appointment and of
the fees of the Secretary. The costs for the Secretary shall be
treated as expenses of the arbitration.

12. Other Issues

At the Meeting, Claimants notified the Respondents and the Tribunal that
they may in the future seek interim measures in the event that the
Government of Kazakhstan seeks to dispose of some or all of the assets
that it has seized and are subject to these proceedings.

On 18 January 2011, Respondent requested that the Tribunal “order Claimants to
engage in amicable settlement discussions as required by Article 26 of the ECT,
and that the proceedings be suspended during the three—month period in
satisfaction of that jurisdictional requirement.” Respondent argued that the Art. 26
ECT requirement that parties refrain from submitting a dispute to international
arbitration unless and until three months have elapsed from the date on which a
party requested amicable settlement of the dispute had not been met. Claimants
asserted that Respondent breached its obligations on 21 July 2010 — five days
before Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration. In addition, Claimants never
gave notice that they intended to assert treaty claims under the ECT and this is in

violation of the requirements of the ECT. Claimants’ reliance on two letters from
2009 was misplaced and did not satisfy the ECT requirements.

On 24 January 2010, Claimants replied that they have observed the three-month
notice period set forth in Art. 26(2) ECT. Claimants reject Respondent’s
arguments that there was insufficient notice of the dispute, and offered instances
where, between 2008 and mid-2010, the Parties attempted to resolve their dispute.
Claimants rejected Respondent’s reliance on a recent decision, Murphy Exploration
and Production Co. Int’l. v. Republic of Ecuador, calling it an aberration in terms
of the weight of investment treaty case law on this subject. Alternatively,
Claimants indicated that, although they would be willing to suspend the arbitration
in order to attempt to achieve settlement, they are not willing to delay the merits
hearing. Claimants would allow for a sixty-day extension of the proceedings if
Respondent were to (1) agree to waive its objections to the notice period and (2)
apportion the suspension time equally between the parties, and (3) make a
settlement proposal or propose a settlement meeting, in a neutral location, within
one week of the letter.

On 28 January 2011, Respondent answered Claimants’ letter.

The Tribunal responded to the Parties on 1 February 2011. The Tribunal
encouraged the Parties to make a good faith effort to agree on a solution, hopefully
maintaining the agreed hearing dates. The Tribunal also indicated its willingness
to select a new, later hearing date in October 2012.

On 2 February 2011, Claimants responded to the Tribunal’s letter of 1 February,
and to Respondent’s letters of 18 and 28 January 2011. Maintaining its objections
to Respondent’s points, Claimants proposed a 90-day suspension of the arbitration
and proposed some changes to the submissions schedule, while maintaining the
hearing date. Claimants indicated their agreement to this would be subject to
Respondent’s agreement that it will not use the suspension period to aggravate the
dispute and requested a response by 4 February 2011 at 17:00 CET.

Respondent replied to Claimants’ letter on 6 February 2011, rejecting Claimants’
arguments that there had been notice and that such notice had been sufficient under
the ECT. Respondent proposed an alternative time table that would allow for a
suspension of the hearing.

On 8 February 2011, Claimants requested that that Tribunal advise the Parties as
to its availability for a 2-week hearing in October 2012.

On 14 February 2011, the Arbitration Institute of the SCC wrote to the Tribunal,
stating that “the final award in the above arbitration shall be rendered on 26 April
2011” and that the Tribunal must request an extension of time for rendering the
final award.

On 22 February 2011, the Tribunal, in consultation with the Parties, created a
revised time table for the dates in Section 5 of PO-1.

In its Statement of Defence (R-I), Respondent characterized this as the Tribunal
having awarded a stay of proceedings with the intention of providing a window for
settlement on 22 February 2011. (R-I{. 7.2; C-II { 72).

On 4 March 2011, the Arbitration Institute of the SCC granted the Tribunal an
extension until 31 July 2013 render an Award.

The Parties met on 10 March 2011 in London for a settlement negotiation. (C-I {|

On 16 June 2011, Respondent retained the law firm Norton Rose to represent it in
this dispute, in place of the law firm of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP.
The SCC reacted on 20 June 2011, sending a “Power of Attorney” for
Respondent’s new counsel.

On 29 June 2011, Respondent returned the completed Power of Attorney forms to
the SCC and informed the Tribunal and Claimants that the interests of the Republic
of Kazakhstan will be represented by the Norton Rose law firm and by Prof. I.
Zenkin, Attorney of Moscow Regional Collegium of Attorneys.

On 21 November 2011, Respondent submitted its Statement of Defence to the
Tribunal.

In a separate writing on 21 November 2011, Respondent proposed trifurcation of
the proceedings. Respondent argued that the Tribunal’s reasons for refusing
bifurcation were not compelling and that trifurcation would be necessary to re-
balance the time table, especially in light of the size and complexity of the case.

On 8 December 2011, Respondent submitted its Request for Disclosure of
Documents and the Explanatory Note thereto to the Tribunal.

On 8 December 2011, Claimants submitted their Request for Production of
Documents. Claimants also requested production of the documents referred to and
relied upon in the expert reports, which were not submitted with those reports.
Claimants indicated that they would seek an order striking the so-called “sleeper
exhibits” (witness statements disguised as exhibits) from the record.

Claimants produced 30 documents on 15 December 2011 and 14 documents on 22
December 2011.

On 5 January 2012, Claimants submitted their Request for Production of
Documents and a cover letter detailing the request and responses to Respondent’s
production objections to the Tribunal. Claimants objected to Respondent’s
provision of so-called “sleeper” witness statements.

On 5 January 2012, Respondent submitted its Redfern Schedule to the Tribunal.

On 5 January 2012, Claimants submitted their Redfern Schedule to the Tribunal,
along with lengthy arguments refuting Respondent’s position.

On 16 January 2012, Respondent submitted its WORD version of the Redfern
Schedule to the Tribunal.

On 26 January 2012, the Tribunal proposed the appointment of Katherine
Simpson as Administrative Secretary to the Parties and requested their comment by
2 February 2012.

On 2 February 2012, the Tribunal, after consultation with the Parties, appointed
Ms. Simpson as Administrative Secretary.

The Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 on Production of Documents (PO-
2) on 3 February 2012. The operative parts of that PO, but not the attached
completed Redfern Schedules, is provided below:

Procedural Order (PO) No. 2
On Production of Documents

Introduction

The Tribunal has taken note of the submissions of the Parties regarding
document production.

The Tribunal recalls Art. 26 SCC Rules regarding evidence.

The Tribunal further recalls section 5.6. of PO-1 providing for the
submission of Redfern Schedules, and that, by the Chairman’s mails of 5
and 12 January 2012, the Tribunal had asked Respondent to submit its
Redfern schedule in WORD format so that the Tribunal can insert its
decisions. The Tribunal notes that, only on 16 January 2012, Respondent
provided such a submission. Due to this delay, the Tribunal could only
issue the present decision today.

According to section 6 of PO-I, the “IBA Rules on the Taking of
Evidence in International Arbitration” can be used as a guideline giving
indications regarding the relevant criteria for what documents may be
requested and ordered to be produced. The Tribunal will use the IBA Rules
(as re-issued 29 May 2010), taking into account the relevant practice of
their application in international arbitration. In this context, the Tribunal
has taken note of the Parties’ submissions regarding the applicable
criteria and will take them into account insofar as they are not in conflict
to the IBA Rules.

The Tribunal recognizes that, on the one hand, ordering the production of
documents can be helpful for a party to present its case and in the
Tribunal’s task of establishing the facts of the case relevant for the issues
to be decided. On the other hand, the process of disclosure may be time-
ing, excessively burdens , and even oppressive. Unless carefully
limited, the burden may be disproportionate to the value of the result.
Further, the Parties may have a legitimate interest in confidentiality.

 

Further, the Tribunal notes that, insofar as a Party has the burden of
proof, it is sufficient for the other Party to deny what the respective Party
has alleged and then respond to and rebut the evidence provided by that
respective Party to comply with its burden of proof.

Documents to be produced

All documents identified in requests to be “admitted” in the Annexes I
and II attached to this Order shall be produced by 17 February 2012 to
the other Party in this procedure, but not yet to the Tribunal, subject to the
further qualifications and limitations in this Order. The receiving Party
may then decide the extent to which it wishes to rely on such documents in

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 31 of 415

3.

3.3.

3.4.

its further submissions to the Tribunal and may submit the respective
documents with its next Memorial.

Qualifications and Limitations of D Prodi

All documents produced under this Order may be utilized by the other
Parties only in direct connection with the present arbitration procedure.

Of the documents ordered by the Tribunal, the following documents or
categories of documents need not be produced, but the reason for the
non-production must be identified. If they:

do not exist or do not yet exist,

or are not in the possession, custody or control of a Party,
or have already been sent or copied to the requesting Party,
or contain commercially sensitive information,

or include information regarding third parties for which the
ordered Party has an obligation of confidentiality,

or are subject to attorney-client privilege under the legal or ethical
rules by which Counsel of the Parties are bound in their respective
jurisdictions,

or which reflect the seeking or rendering of a legal opinion by
internal or external counsel.

If a document or category of documents ordered by the Tribunal only
contains some information or sections which do not have to be produced
according to Section 3.3 above, the respective document may be redacted
in such a way that those sections are excluded from the production. But
the reason for non-production or redaction and the extent of such
redaction must be indicated in a separate note or in the document.

“Documents” should be understood to include permanent records in any

form, including on paper and electronic.

Adverse Inference

Insofar as documents ordered are not produced or are not produced as
ruled in this Order, the Tribunal may take this into account in its
evaluation of the respective factual allegations and evidence and may draw
an inference against the Party refusing production.

Tribunal’s Decisions in attached Redfern Schedules
According to Section 2 above, as Annexes I and II, the following Redfern

Schedules submitted by the Parties are attached in which the respective
decisions of the Tribunal are added in the last column:

Page 31 of 414

Claimants’ Redfern Schedule dated 5 January 2012,

Respondent’s Redfern Schedule dated 5 January 2012, but
submitted in WORD format on 16 January 2012.

6. Claimants’ application dated 5 January 2012 regarding “Sleeper Expert
reports and Witness Statements”

6.1. The Tribunal has taken note of Claimants’ earlier letter of 8 December
2011 and Claimant’s applications in its letter of 5 January 2012, to which
Respondent has not yet replied.

6.2. The Tribunal invites both Claimants and Respondent, after having taken
note of the Tribunal’s decisions on their Redfern schedules, to submit any
further comments in this regard by 17 February 2012.

The Chairman’s email of 3 February 2012 is also provided for convenience:
Dear colleagues,

1. Production of Documents

Attached please find Procedural Order No.2 (PO-2) together with its two
Annexes containing the Tribunal’s decisions on the Parties’ Redfern
Schedules.

Since, due to the delayed submission of the WORD version of Respondent's
Redfern schedule, PO-2 could not be issued in time, as you see, the
production is now ordered to be by 17 February which is the period of two
weeks after the Tribunal’s decisions originally provided in the agreed
revised timetable confirmed by my mail of 2 December 2011.

2._New date for Claimant’s Reply Memorial

In view of the above mentioned delay, the date by which Claimant is to
submit its Reply Memorial is now set two weeks later, i.e. 16 April 2012.
As, thereafter, Respondent’s Rejoinder is only due by 26 June 2012, the
remainder of the agreed timetable up to the hearing is maintained without
prejudice to the further exchange under section 3 hereafter.

3._Respondent’s Procedural Applications dated 21 November 2011

After the decisions on document disclosure have now been issued,
Claimants are hereby invited to comment by 17 February 2012 on
Respondent’s procedural applications submitted by letter of 21 November
2011.

4,_ Communications to Tribunal’s Administrative Secretary

In follow-up to my mail of 26 January 2012, the Parties are from now on
invited to send copies of all electronic and hard copy communications, in

5. Correct Address of Prof. Lebedev

As communications to Co-Arbitrator Prof. Lebedev have been sent to
different addresses, the Parties are invited to submit further
communications only to his following address:

Moscow 129626, Staroalexeevskaya 16/49.

On 7 February 2012, the SCC confirmed the appointment of Ms. Simpson.

On 16 February 2012, Claimants wrote to Respondent, requesting the production
of the documents and data referred to and relied upon by its party-appointed
experts, Deloitte and GCA.

On 17 February 2012, Claimants wrote to Respondent in response to PO-2.
Claimants would provide Respondent’s counsel 285 documents, in addition to
those produced on 15 and 22 December 2011. Claimants indicated reasons for
non-production of some of the requested documents.

On 17 February 2012, Claimants requested that the Tribunal:

. Order Kazakhstan to produce immediately all materials upon which
Deloitte and GCA relied when preparing their expert reports;

. Clarify its decision with respect to Kazakhstan’s “sleeper” expert reports
and witness statements to the extent necessary;

. Order Kazakhstan to identify immediately all of the individuals who
authored the twenty “sleeper” expert reports and witness statements;

. Reject Kazakhstan's application to trifurcate this proceeding;
. Reject Kazakhstan's request to “rebalance” the procedural calendar; and
. Reject Kazakhstan’s request to extend the currently-scheduled 10 day

hearing to 22 days in length.

On 21 February 2012, Claimants requested that the Tribunal instruct Respondent
to comply with its d production obligations, or suffer the q of
its failure to comply with the Tribunal’s document production decision.

On 22 February 2012, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit any comments to
the other’s submissions of 16 and 17 February by 12 March 2012.

On 12 March 2012, Claimants wrote in response to the Tribunal’s 22 February
2012 request for additional comments, reiterating its earlier arguments and urging
the Tribunal not to allow Respondent to benefit from its obstructionism, while
protecting Claimants’ right to a fair hearing.

On 24 March 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (PO-3). The
entire text of PO-3 is set out below:

2d.

2.2.

2.3.

2.4.

Procedural Order (PO) No. 3
Introduction

The Tribunal has taken note of the recent submissions of the Parties
regarding document production and regarding the further procedure.
Since the Parties had the opportunity to file two rounds of submissions and
since the arguments put forward in these submissions are well known to
the Parties, the Tribunal sees no need to repeat the many arguments of the
Parties.

Taking into account all the arguments presented by the Parties, the
Tribunal comes to the following observations and conclusions.

Document Production

The earlier rulings of the Tribunal, particularly in PO-2, its Annexes, and
the Chairman’s letter of 3 February 2012, are maintained and are hereby
confirmed.

Due to a clerical error, Claimant’s Request no. 48 in Annex I of PO-2 was
not decided. It is now decided as follows:

“Admitted in so far as documents are referenced or relied upon in Exhibit
R-118.”

Regarding supporting documents to the reports by Deloitte, GCA, and
Neftegazconsult, as well as to other reports submitted by Claimants and
Respondent, it is confirmed that these have to be produced now, in so far
as they have not yet been produced. If a Party chooses not to produce
them, this will have the consequences mentioned in Section 4 of PO-2 and
in the last paragraph on the title page of Annex I to PO-2.

Regarding what the Claimants refer to as “Sleeper” reports and
statements, the Tribunal has already admitted the respective requests by
Claimants in Annex I to PO-2, as explained in the last paragraph on the
title page of Annex I to PO-2. It is clarified that the required disclosure
includes the identification of the authors of such documents. And, it is
confirmed that, if Respondent chooses not to produce, this will have the
consequences mentioned in Section 4 of PO-2 and in the last paragraph on
the title page of Annex I to PO-2.

Insofar as the Parties in view of PO-2, in view of their further submissions
thereafter regarding their own or the othe rParty’s production up to now,
and in view of the above clarifications in this PO, choose to still produce
documents, they shall do so by 2 April 2012 in order to provide for the next
procedural step according to the agreed timetable, i.e. to enable Claimant
to take such documents into account in its Reply Memorial now due by 16
April 2012 according to my letter of 3 February 2012. Otherwise it will be
assumed that the Party has chosen not to produce with the consequences
mentioned above.

Finally, the Tribunal confirms that it is left to each Party whether or not it
will produce documents. However the Tribunal stresses, that both the
Parties and the Tribunal have an interest that all relevant evidence is
available for an orderly discussion and for decisions by the Tribunal and
also an interest that neither non-production leads to adverse inferences
nor that submitted evidence may be considered of little or even no
evidentiary value due to non-production of supporting documents or
information.

Further Procedure
Regarding the further procedure, the Tribunal recalls Section 2.1 of PO-1:

2.1. This PO records the results of the discussion and agreements
reached at the Meeting. A draft of this PO was sent to the Parties after the
Meeting inviting comments by 3 January 2011, if a Party considered that a
result was not correctly recorded. Taking into account comments received,
the Tribunal examined whether any changes seemed appropriate and
hereby issues the Order in its final version.

The Tribunal notes that Respondent is well acquainted with international
arbitration procedures from other earlier cases and was represented at the
Stockholm meeting by counsel also regularly active in this field.

It is further recalled that, in February 2011, the Parties submitted a joint
proposal for a new timetable, which the Tribunal accepted by the
Chairman’s letter of 22 February 2011.

The Tribunal considers that changing the agreed and so far implemented
procedure at the present stage would considerably disrupt the procedure
and would only be acceptable for mandatory and urgent reasons. The
Tribunal does not see any such reasons in the present case.

Therefore, the procedure shall proceed as established in PO-I and later
rulings of the Tribunal slightly adapting the timetable.

According to the agreement recorded in Sections 4.3 and 7.4 of PO-I,
English will remain the language of this procedure. However, while
accordingly, the hearing shall also be conducted in English, the Parties
may make arrangements at the hearing for simultaneous interpretation to
Russian. Anyhow, if witnesses or experts are examined at the hearing who
do not testify in English, such arrangement will have to be made by the

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 36 of 415

3.7.

3.8.

3.9.

Page 35 of 414

Parties in accordance with Section 10.7 of PO-1. Therefore, it is
suggested that the Parties when they contact the ICC Hearing Centre in
accordance with the Chairman’s mail of 4 April 2011 regarding the
logistics of the hearing (it is suggested that they do so soon), they also
request to use the logistics for simultaneous interpretation which are
available at the Centre.

Regarding the length of the hearing, the Tribunal recalls the agreement
recorded in section 6.18 0 fPo-1 which, taking into account the dates of the
jointly proposed and accepted new timetable provides for the Hearing to
be held from 1 to 5 October 2012, and, if found necessary by the Tribunal
after consultation with the Parties, extended to continue from 8 to 12
October 2012.

Further, the Tribunal recalls the agreement recorded in Section 10.5 of
PO-1:

Taking into account the time available during the period provided for the
Hearing in the Timetable, the Tribunal intends to establish equal maximum
time periods both for the Claimants and for the Respondent which the
Parties shall have available. Changes to that principle may be applied for
at the latest by 25 April 2012.

To clarify the intention of the Tribunal regarding the conduct of the
hearing, though further details will have to be determined later according
to Section 5.17 of PO-I after consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal
already now informs the Parties that it intends to include the following
rulings, which have proved to be efficient and acceptable to the parties in
similar cases:

A. In order to make most efficient use of time at the Hearing, written
Witness Statements or Expert Reports shall generally be used in
lieu of direct oral examination though exceptions may be
admitted by the Tribunal. Therefore, insofar as, at the Hearing,
such witnesses or experts are invited by the presenting Party or
asked to attend at the request of the other Party, the presenting
Party may introduce the witness or expert for up to 10 minutes and
add direct examination on issues, if any, which have occurred after
the last written statement or report of the witness or expert has
been submitted. The remaining hearing time shall be reserved for
cross-examination and re-direct examination, as well as for
questions by the Arbitrators.

B. The following Agenda is intended to be established for the
Hearing:

I. Introduction by the Chairman of the Tribunal.

2. Opening Statements of not more than total of two hours for
each Party

First on jurisdiction

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 37 of 415

Page 36 of 414

a) Respondent up to 30 minutes

b) Claimants up to 30 minutes

Second on all other issues including the Merits
a) Claimants up to 90 minutes

b) Respondent up to 30 minutes

3. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties: Examination of
Claimants’ fact witnesses:

a) Affirmation of witness to tell the truth.
b) Short introduction by Claimants
c) Cross-examination by Respondent.

d) Re-direct examination by Claimants, but only on
issues raised in cross-examination.

e) Re-cross examination by Respondent but only on
issues raised in re-direct examination.

A Remaining questions by members of the Tribunal,
but they may raise questions at any time.

4. Examination of Respondent's fact witnesses. For each: vice versa
as under 3.a) to f) above.

5. Examination of experts as under 3.a) to f) above.

6. Any witness or expert may only be recalled for rebuttal
examination by a Party or the members of the Tribunal, if such
intention is announced in time to assure the availability of the
witness and expert during the time of the Hearing.

7. Oral closing arguments of up to 2 hours (or longer if authorized by
the Tribunal after consultation with the Parties during the
hearing) each for the
a) Claimants,

b) Respondent.

8. Remaining questions by the members of the Tribunal, if any.

9. Discussion regarding the timing and details of post-hearing
submissions and other procedural issues.

Taking into account the above rulings and intended conduct of the hearing,
and also taking into account, from the submissions already received, the

Page 37 of 414

volume and complexity of the issues to be dealt with at the hearing, the
Tribunal concludes that the period blocked for the hearing in accordance
with the agreed timetable is sufficient.

4. Beyond the above observations and rulings, the Tribunal does not consider
any action necessary from its side.

On 2 April 2012, Respondent confirmed that it had sent Claimants approximately
32,000 pages of requested documents. Respondent also contacted the ICC Hearing
Center. Finally, Respondent stated that the time period for the oral hearing on
jurisdictional matters is not sufficient and proposed devoting the period from 1 — 5
October to jurisdictional matters.

On 4 April 2012, Claimants requested an extension of six weeks for the
preparation of their Reply, since that amount of time would be necessary to
translate and read the 32,000 pages of documents sent by Respondent — sent 14
days prior to Claimants’ deadline to submit the Reply.

On 10 April 2012, the Tribunal wrote to the Arbitration Institute of the SCC. In
light of changes in the case, it became necessary for the Tribunal to ask that its fees
and the Security for Expenses be doubled.

On 11 April 2012, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, objecting to Claimants’
requests for extensions of time unless the same time period would be granted for
Respondent’s Rejoinder.

On 21 April 2012, the Tribunal circulated a draft of Procedural Order No. 4 (PO-4)
to the Parties for their review and comment by 30 April 2012.

On 23 April 2012, the Arbitration Institute of the SCC forwarded the Parties the
Tribunal’s letter of 10 April 2012 and requested their response by 30 April 2012.

On 24 April 2012, Claimants provided their comments to draft PO-4. Claimants
objected to moving the hearing date and proposed alternatives.

On 4 May 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 to the Parties. The
entire text is provided below, for ease of reference:

Procedural Order (PO) No.4

A draft of this PO was sent to the Parties for comments by 30 April 2012. Taking
into account the comments received from the Parties, the Tribunal now issues the
PO in its final form.

1 Introduction

Ld. The Tribunal has taken note of Claimants’ Application of 4 April
and letter of 24 April 2012 and of Respondent’s comments of 11
April and letters of 30 April 2012, both with attachments and
proposals for a new timetable. Since the arguments put forward in

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 39 of 415

Page 38 of 414

these submissions are well-known to the Parties, the Tribunal sees
no need to repeat them here.

Taking into account all the arguments presented by the Parties, the
Tribunal comes to the following observations and conclusions.

2. Relevant aspects of the procedure up to now

2.1.

2.2.

2.3.

2.4,

2.5.

2.6.

2.7.

The Tribunal recalls Procedural Order No.3 (PO-3), particularly
its Section 3. The respective rulings are confirmed, subject to
changes hereafter in this PO.

The Tribunal notes that both Parties now agree that the timetable
as confirmed by PO-3 should be changed. But they disagree in
which way it should be changed.

The Tribunal recalls the second introductory paragraph of Annex I
to PO-2 dated 3 February 2012:

Further, the Tribunal clarifies that, in so far as Respondent has
submitted exhibits, in particular statements and reports (which
Claimants refer to as “Sleeper” Reports and Statements), the
Tribunal has admitted Claimants’ requests that documents on
which such exhibits rely, etc., shall be produced. However, if
Respondent chooses not to produce such documents, this will be
taken into account by the Tribunal regarding the evidentiary value
of such exhibits. The same may apply, if persons who have
produced such exhibits and who are called for cross-examination
by Claimants, do not appear at the hearing for cross examination.

In their submissions dated 17 and 21 February 2012, Claimants
identified and listed a number of such documents alleging that they
had not been produced by Respondent and requested (pages 11
and 12 of the letter of 17 February 2012) that the Tribunal order
Respondent to produce them “immediately.”

The Tribunal understands that, rather than relying on the
Tribunal’s reaction concerning ordered but not produced
documents identified in the paragraph quoted above from Annex I,
Claimants considered the disclosure of these documents so
essential for their Reply Memorial that they insisted on their
production.

Taking into account Claimants’ submissions and Respondent’s
further submissions, in Section 2 of PO-3, the Tribunal provided
further clarifications and a further opportunity to the Parties to
produce further documents by the new deadline of 2 April 2012.

By that date of 2 April 2012, Respondent submitted its letter of that
date announcing the disclosure of a great number of documents
which seem to include all those requested by Claimants.

By letter of 4 April 2012, Claimants submitted that they could not
address this volume of documents now disclosed by Respondent by
the deadline of 16 April set for their Reply Memorial. Therefore,
they proposed a new timetable.

By letter of 11 April 2012, Respondent submitted comments on
Claimants’ letter. Particularly, Respondent listed a number of
documents which it alleged Claimants should have disclosed
according to PO-3 and proposed a new timetable different from
that proposed by Claimants.

By letter of 24 April 2012, Claimants submitted comments on the
draft PO and, particularly, declared themselves ready to submit
their Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction and Liability by 7 May and
their Reply Memorial on Quantum by 28 May 2012. On that basis,
Claimants suggested new alternative timetables.

By letters of 30 April 2012, Respondent submitted letters and
appended comments on the draft PO-4 and on Claimants’ letter of
24 April 2012.

3. The Tribunal’s Conclusions

3.1.

3.2.

3.3.

3.4,

3.5.

The Tribunal understands that the Parties prefer to have as many
relevant documents as possible available for their final Memorials
before the hearing on the merits.

The Tribunal also feels that every effort should be made to have all
relevant documentation on file in order to fully evaluate the
Parties’ submissions and evidence.

The Tribunal agrees with the Parties that, therefore, the timetable
should be changed. The Tribunal recalls that, in its draft PO-4, it
already asked for the Parties’ views regarding a bifurcation with
an early hearing on jurisdiction. The Tribunal notes that both the
Claimants (in their Alternative 2) and the Respondent now accept
bifurcation, though they do not agree on its scope.

Since the great majority of the large volume of documents which
Respondent should have produced by 17 February 2012 according
to the second introductory paragraph of Annex I to PO-2, but were
produced only by 2 April 2012, concerns the quantum of the
claims, the Tribunal finds that bifurcating the procedure into a first
phase on jurisdiction and liability and a second phase on quantum,
is the relatively best solution in order to avoid undue delay for the
entire procedure under the present circumstances.

In this context, the Tribunal finds it helpful that Claimants now
accept 7 May 2012 as an earlier deadline for their Reply Memorial
on jurisdiction and liability, and still the originally suggested

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 41 of 415

3.6.

3.7.

3.8.

Page 40 of 414

deadline of 28 May 2012 for their Reply Memorial on quantum,
and also foregoes its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction. Insofar as, from
the list of allegedly missing documents according to Respondent’s
letter of 11 April 2012, Claimants are ready to submit such
documents, they should at the latest be submitted with these
Memorials.

While the Tribunal agreed with Respondent that the deadline
originally suggested by Claimants for Respondent's Rejoinder
Memorial, i.e. 6 August 2012, was not sufficient, bifurcation would
allow different deadlines for Respondent’s two Rejoinder
Memorials in the two phases. Since Claimants’ Reply Memorial on
Jurisdiction and Liability can now be submitted by 7 May 2012,
the Tribunal considers that Respondent can now be expected to
submit its Rejoinder Memorial restricted to jurisdiction and
liability by 26 July 2012.

Thereafter, as Claimants have forgone their right to submit a
Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, there will be sufficient time for the
further procedural steps up to a hearing starting at the originally
agreed date of 1 October 2012, but restricted to jurisdiction and
liability.

Regarding the procedure on quantum, a separate timetable could,
thus, be set up leading to a shorter hearing on quantum only at a
later time.

4. New Timetable

4.1.

4.2.

4.3.

4.4,

Taking into account its above conclusions, the Tribunal hereby sets
the following new Timetable for the further procedure using and
adapting the originally agreed procedural steps in Sections 5.9 to
5.19 of PO-1.

By 7 May 2012, the Claimants file their Reply Memorial on
jurisdiction and liability with any further evidence (documents,
witness statements, expert statements), but only in rebuttal to
Respondent’s Statement of Defence or regarding new evidence
from the procedure for document production.

By 28 May 2012, the Claimants file their Reply Memorial on
quantum with any further evidence (documents, witness statements,
expert statements), but only in rebuttal to Respondent’s Statement
of Defence or regarding new evidence from the procedure for
document production.

By 26 July 2012, the Respondent files its Rejoinder Memorial on
jurisdiction and liability with any further evidence (documents,
witness statements, expert statements), but only in rebuttal to
Claimants’ Reply Memorial or regarding new evidence from the
procedure for document production.

Thereafter, no new evidence may be submitted regarding
jurisdiction and liability, unless agreed between the Parties or
expressly authorized by the Tribunal.

By 3 August 2012, the Parties submit

notifications of the witnesses and experts presented by themselves
or by the other Party they wish to examine at the Hearing on
jurisdiction and liability including any information which witness
or expert cannot testify in English,

and an updated list of all exhibits regarding jurisdiction and
liability with indications where the respective documents can be
found in the file and an electronic version on a CD or USBB-
device of that list hyperlinked to the exhibits.

By 10 August 2012, a Party may amend its notification of
witnesses and experts, if it considers that necessary in view of the
notification received from the other Party.

Thereafter, the Tribunal will send the Parties a draft of a
Procedural Order regarding further details of the Hearing inviting
comments from the Parties.

Within 3 weeks later, at a date set by the Tribunal after
consultation of the Parties, a Pre-Hearing Conference by
telephone between the Parties and the Tribunal may be held, if
considered necessary by the Tribunal.

As soon as possible thereafter, Tribunal will issue a Procedural
Order regarding details of the Hearing on jurisdiction and
liability.

Hearing from I to 5 October 2012, and, if found necessary by the
Tribunal after consultation with the Parties, extended to continue
from 8 to 9 October 2012.

Towards the end of the Hearing, the Tribunal will consult with the
Parties regarding the further procedure up to the hearing on
quantum.

Subject to any changes resulting from the discussion at the above
hearing in October, by 21 November 2012, Respondent’s
Rejoinder on quantum.

Dates for a period of up to 4 days for the hearing on quantum will
be determined after further exchanges between the Tribunal and
the Parties as soon as possible.

5.1. The Tribunal recalls regarding the logistics at the Hearing:

* Section 10.6 of PO-1 (transcript)

* Section 10.7 of PO-1 (interpretation)

* the Chairman’s mail of 4 April to the ICC Hearing Centre in Paris,
which was copied to the Parties (arrangements and billing at the
Centre).

5.2. The Parties are invited to jointly make the necessary arrangements

and inform the Tribunal accordingly by 26 July 2012.

On 7 May 2012, Claimants notified the Tribunal that it required an extension until
14:00 CET on 8 May in order to make its submission, due to the size of the
submission, as well as lingering issues of obtaining signatures and translations
across various jurisdictions.

On 8 May 2012, Claimants submitted Claimants’ Reply Memorial on
Jurisdiction and Liability (C-II), together with 7 witness statements and 5 expert
reports, to the Tribunal.

On 9 May 2012, the Arbitration Institute of the SCC decided that additional
advances, in the amount of EUR 422 000 shall be paid by Respondent by 23 May
2013 and so notified the Parties.

On 24 May 2012, the Arbitration Institute of the SCC wrote to the Parties,
reminding Respondent to pay the outstanding advance of EUR 422 000 and
extending the deadline to | June 2012.

On 28 May 2012, Claimants submitted Claimants’ Reply Memorial on
Quantum (C-II]) to the Tribunal.

On 30 May 2012, Respondent advised the Tribunal that Respondent appointed Dr.
Patricia Nacimiento of Norton Rose LLP as counsel.

On 30 May 2012, Respondent applied for an extension of the deadline to submit
Respondent’s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Liability (R-II).

On 31 May 2012, the Tribunal confirmed receipt of Respondent’s two letters of 30
May 2012 and invited Claimants to submit any comments thereto by 4 June 2012.

On 4 June 2012, Claimants responded that they do not object to Respondent being
provided a brief extension of one week or less for its Rejoinder, and left the matter
to the Tribunal’s discretion.

On 5 June 2012, Respondent urged the Tribunal to grant the requested extension
and arguing that an extension was necessary in order that Respondent adequately
reply to Claimants’ new evidence.

On 5 June 2012, Claimants urged the Tribunal to grant a shorter extension that
would leave the bulk of August and September available to prepare for the October
hearing.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 44 of 415
Page 43 of 414

76. On6 June 2012, the Tribunal sent the following email to the Parties.

[T]he Tribunal has taken note of the Parties’ recent communications.
Since they are well known to all concerned, there is no need to repeat or
sununarize them again.

I. Regarding Respondent’s 1 letter of 30 May 2012.
In this regard, I as Chairman disclose the following.

Dr. Patricia Nacimiento, who is announced as a new additional counsel, is
one of my two co-editors of the book “Arbitration in Germany” published
some years ago and planned for a 2™ edition in the future. I have not ever
had and still do not have any other professional contact with her. I do not
consider that her appointment raises any professional conflict either for
her or for my involvement in this arbitration. However, as a precaution, I
inform the parties of the above (which anyhow can be seen from the book
having been on the market for some years). I add that the other members of
the Tribunal also do not see any conflict. Unless we receive an objection
from one of the Parties within one week of this letter, we consider this
matter as closed.

2. Regarding Respondent’s 2" letter of 30 May 2012.

After an examination of the Respondent’s extension application and the
comments received from the Parties, mainly for the reasons mentioned in
the Respondent's letter of 30 May, the Tribunal concludes that the
requested extension shall be granted as follows:

The dates in PO-4 are changed as hereafter:
Section 4.4. to 13 August 2012
Section 4.6. to 20 August 2012
Section 4.7. to 27 August 2012
Oo with the later sections and, of course, the hearing dates
remaining unchanged.

3. Hearing on Quantum.

Pursuant to 4.14 of PO-4, the Tribunal has had an exchange on possible
dates for the Hearing on Quantum. It has turned out that, after the
Respondent’s Rejoinder due by 21 November 2012, the only period prior to
April 2012 at which all three members of the Tribunal are available for the
4 day hearing, is 28 to 31 January 2013.

Therefore, the Tribunal sets the hearing for these dates and requests the
Parties to block that period for a hearing in Paris. Further details will be
determined later.

77. On 12 June 2012, the Arbitration Institute of the SCC advised that Respondent still
has not made the required EUR 422 000 payment. Claimants were, therefore,
invited to make the payment by 19 June 2012.

On 20 June 2012, the Arbitration Institute of the SCC advised that Claimants
provided the additional advance of EUR 422 000, as ordered.

On 24 June 2012, the Tribunal provided the Parties the ICC Centre’s revised
reservation confirmation for the shortened hearing in October 2012 and the ICC
Centre’s Quotation for the 2™ hearing to take place in January 2013. The Tribunal
invited the Parties to confirm the reservation to the ICC Centre by 9 July 2012 and
to inform the Tribunal by the same date.

On 4 July 2012, Claimants announced the confirmation of the reservations with the
ICC Centre for the October 2012 and the January 2013 hearings and also
announced the relocation of its counsel’s Paris office.

On 1 August 2012, the Tribunal requested that the Parties submit Microsoft
WORD versions of each of the Memorials to the Tribunal. The Parties complied
on 3 August 2012.

On 13 August 2012, Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and
Liability, and the accompanying witness statements and export reports, with the
Tribunal.

On 20 August 2012, the Parties submitted their respective notifications of
witnesses and experts for examination at the hearing, pursuant to PO-4 as amended
on 6 June 2012, to the Tribunal.

On 23 August 2012, the Chairman distributed the Tribunal’s draft for a
Procedural Order No. 5 regarding the details of the hearing in October to the
Parties. The Tribunal requested responses by 7 September.

On 27 August 2012, Respondent emailed the Tribunal. Respondent confirmed
receipt of draft PO-5 and requested that the Tribunal confirm that, by the attached
draft, the deadline initially established for 27 August 2012 for the Parties’
comments to the respective letters of 20 August 2012 is superseded and that the
next relevant deadline is 7 September 2012.

On 27 August 2012, the Tribunal confirmed the 27 August deadline.

On 27 August 2012, the Parties, in separate emails, confirmed their 20 August
2012 notifications of witnesses and experts for examination at the hearing and
indicated that neither wished to make any changes to those lists.

On 7 September 2012, Claimants and Respondent, in separate letters, submitted
their comments to draft PO-S to the Tribunal.

On 8 September 2012, Respondent wrote in response to Claimants’ letter of 7
September 2012, indicating that the contents of Claimants’ letter deviated in part
from the Parties’ discussions. In particular, Respondent strongly objected to using
the January hearing for any purpose other than quantum.

On 11 September 2012, the Tribunal thanked the Parties for their cooperation on
logistics and arrangements with the ICC Hearing Centre and invited them to a
telephone conference at 15:00 Paris time on 15 September.

On 13 September 2012, Claimants confirmed their attendance for the October
hearing. While Claimants would prefer to hear expert testimony at the hearing,
they are mindful that the Tribunal considers that oral testimony from the experts
may be unnecessary. Instead, Claimants stated that they will not insist on
presenting experts or on cross-examining Respondent’s experts at the October
hearing unless Respondent calls an expert. Finally, Claimants stated that they did
not consider a pre-hearing telephone conference with the Tribunal to be necessary.

On 14 September 2012, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal with comments on PO-
5. Respondent suggested that the order of witnesses should be notified by 26
September, at the latest. Respondent also requested that witnesses Messrs.
Smagulov, Aubakirov, and Aldashev be heard by video-conferencing. Respondent
asked that the deadline for Post-Hearing Briefs be set after the January 2013
hearing.

On 14 September 2012 the Chairman replied, stating that Respondent would need
to make witnesses Smagulov, Aubakirov, and Aldashev available for oral
testimony at the hearing or, alternatively, could withdraw their witness statements,
per section 3.6 of draft PO-S.

On 14 September 2012, Claimants requested the Tribunal’s permission to submit a
limited number of documents into evidence in advance of the October hearing,
pursuant to points 7.3 and 10.4 of PO-1.

On 16 September 2012, Respondent urged dismissal of the request.

On 16 September 2012, Claimants replied to Respondent’s email, explaining that
the evidence sought to be admitted is pertinent and responsive to new arguments
made by Respondent.

On 18 September 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order (PO) No. 5
Regarding further details of the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability (PO-5).
The entire text is provided below for ease of reference:

  

Procedural Order (PO) No.5
Regarding further details of the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability

A draft of this PO was sent to the Parties for comments by 7 September 2012.

Thereafter, taking into account:

. the comments on the draft and further submissions received from the
Parties,

. the Tribunal’s letter to the Parties dated 11 September 2012

. and the submissions received from the Parties thereafter,

the Tribunal now issues the PO in its final form.

i. Earlier Agreements and Rulings

Ld.

1.2.

13

In order to have all rulings relevant for the hearing available in one document, this
Order recalls the earlier agreements and rulings of the Tribunal and confirms
them, to the extent that they are not amended in this PO, in bracketed text or
elsewhere. The Tribunal particularly takes into account the recent submissions
and letters of the Parties.

In particular, with reference to section 2.1 of PO-4, the following sections of PO-3
are recalled and again confirmed:

3.7.

3.8.

3.9.

3.10.

Regarding the length of the hearing, the Tribunal recalls the agreement
recorded in Section 6.18 of PO-1 which, taking into account the dates of
the jointly proposed and accepted new timetable, provides for the Hearing
to be held from I to 5 October 2012, and, if found necessary by the
Tribunal after consultation with the Parties, extended to continue from 8 to
9 October 2012. [In this regard, section 4.11 of PO-4 decided on the
bifurcation of the proceedings and ruled that extension days would include
only 8 to 9 October. ].

Further, the Tribunal recalls the agreement recorded in Section 10.5 of
PO-I:

Taking into account the time available during the period provided for the
Hearing in the Timetable, the Tribunal intends to establish equal
maximum time periods both for the Claimants and for the Respondent
which the Parties shall have available. Changes to that principle may be
applied for at the latest by 25 April 2012.

To clarify the intention of the Tribunal regarding the conduct of the
hearing, though further details will have to be determined later according
to Section 5.17 of PO-I after consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal
already now informs the Parties that it intends to include the following
rulings which have proved to be efficient and acceptable to the parties in
similar cases:

[The later provisions of § 3.9 of PO-3 are not recalled, but are later
included in this PO-5 in their amended form as now valid for the hearing.]

Taking into account the above rulings and intended conduct of the hearing
and also taking into account, from the submissions already received, the
volume and complexity of the issues to be dealt with at the hearing, the
Tribunal concludes that the period blocked for the hearing in accordance
with the agreed timetable is sufficient.

Further, the Tribunal recalls from PO-1 the following sections:

10.4,

No new documents may be presented at the Hearing unless authorized in
advance by the Tribunal. This also applies to documents regarding the

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 48 of 415

10.5.

10.6.

10.7.

Page 47 of 414

credibility of a witness or expert. But demonstrative exhibits may be shown
using documents submitted earlier in accordance with the Timetable.

Taking into account the time available during the period provided for the
Hearing in the Timetable, the Tribunal intends to establish equal maximum
time periods both for the Claimants and for the Respondent which the
Parties shall have available. Changes to that principle may be applied for
at the latest by 25 April 2012.

A live transcript shall be made of the Hearing. The Parties, who shall
share the respective costs, shall try to agree on and make the necessary
arrangements in this regard and shall inform the Tribunal accordingly two
months before the time set for the Hearing, i.e. 23 May 2012.

Should the Parties be presenting a witness or expert not testifying in
English and thus requiring interpretation, they are expected to provide the
interpreter unless agreed otherwise. Should more than one witness or
expert need interpretation, to avoid the need of double time for successive
interpretation, simultaneous interpretation shall be provided. The Parties,
who shall share the respective costs, shall try to agree on and make the
necessary arrangements in this regard and shall inform the Tribunal
accordingly two months before the time set for the Hearing, i.e. 23 May
2012.

Further, the Tribunal recalls from the Tribunal’s letter dated 11 September 2012
the following sections:

1. Logistics of the Hearing

The Tribunal thanks the Parties for their arrangements with the ICC
Hearing Centre.

The Parties’ selection of Mr. McGowan as court reporter is an excellent
one. It should be pointed out to him that very few interruptions of the
hearing will be possible so that he can bring a colleague in case he
considers that necessary.

For the same reasons, the interpreters should be notified and it may be
necessary for them to bring a second team to allow un-interrupted
simultaneous interpretation.

In order to make sure that all the logistics are ready before the beginning
of the hearing Monday I October 2012 at 9:30, it should be assured early
enough (either on Sunday or very early Monday morning) that the hearing
room is set up, including in particular that:

All files of the Parties are set up,

There is sufficient room for the members of the Tribunal to spread
their files on their desks,

The hearing binders for the Tribunal on separate carts behind every
member of the Tribunal,

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 49 of 415

ee ee

Page 48 of 414

Microphones for all speaking connected to loud speakers,

All of the equipment of the court reporter is set up,

All of the equipment for the simultaneous interpretation is set up, and
There are sufficient plugs available for the individual laptops of the
Parties, of the members of the Tribunal, and of the Tribunal Secretary, in
addition to the live laptops of _ the court reporter.

The Parties are invited to inform the Tribunal in advance at which time this
preparation will be done so that the Tribunal Secretary can join them at an
appropriate time.

1.6.

2d.

2.2.

Subject to the provisions below, for the case that Mr. Seong-Hoon Kim is
to be examined orally, the Parties should make all arrangements for a
video examination from Korea for an appropriate time during the hearing
agreed between the Parties and notified to the Tribunal.

Fact Witnesses

The Tribunal thanks the Parties for reducing the number of fact witnesses
to be heard at the hearing.

As agreed between the Parties, they are invited to notify the other Party
and the Tribunal as early as possible and at the latest by the beginning of
the hearing regarding the order in which the fact witnesses should be
heard.

3. Experts

31

3.2.

3.3.

The Tribunal thanks the Parties for their efforts and suggestions regarding
the examination of experts.

The Tribunal recalls from the chairman's letter of 23 August 2012 the
indication that, in view of the extensive reports of most experts, the
Tribunal considers that oral examination of most experts may not be
necessary.

Having reviewed the various considerations and suggestions of the Parties
in their recent communications in this regard, the Tribunal rules as
follows:

3.3.1. With their 1" round of Post-Hearing Briefs after the October
hearing, the Parties may submit comments of their experts, but
only regarding any new developments or issues which they have
not addressed in their earlier reports, if considered necessary.

3.3.2. With their 2" round of Post-Hearing Briefs after the October
hearing, the Parties may submit reply comments of their experts to
the comments of the experts of the other Party submitted in the 1"
round, if considered necessary.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 50 of 415

3.3.2.

3.3.3.

3.3.4.

3.3.5.

 

Page 49 of 414

[sic] If, in spite of the above opportunity for written additional
comments by the experts, a Party insists that oral examination
should take place at the hearing, the examination of experts will be
conducted by expert conferencing of the experts from both sides on
the respective issues as follows:

. Short introduction up to 5 minutes of each expert by the
Party which presented that expert,
. Questions by the Parties to the experts, but only regarding

any new developments or issues which the experts have
not yet addressed in their earlier reports,

. Additional questions by the Tribunal, if any, and

. Follow-up questions by the Parties on the questions raised
by the Tribunal, if any.

In so far as a Party insists on oral examination of an expert
according to section 3.3.2. above, it shall notify the Tribunal by
noon (Paris time) Friday 14 September 2012

. of the respective expert who should be examined,

. the respective expert from the other side who should join
the conferencing, and

. the issues on which the conferencing examination should
focus.

In so far as a notification is made according to section 3.3.3.
above, the Parties shall make the respective experts available at
the hearing.

In preparation of the hearing, the notified experts regarding the
same issues, in so far as they will attend the hearing, are invited to
try to agree on a note, or otherwise send separate notes, listing
major points of agreement and disagreement, and the Parties shall
submit such notes to the Tribunal by 24 September 2012.

4. Further procedure

4.1, As the Parties must have sufficient time to prepare the hearing and assure
attendance (including getting visas etc) of the witnesses and experts
required at the hearing, the Tribunal intends to issue PO-5 as soon as
possible after 14 September 2012 and any possible notifications received
by that time. The Parties are invited to start their preparations for the
hearing already now on the basis of the provisions in the draft PO-5 they
received in so far as these are not affected by the rulings in this letter of
the Tribunal.

4.2. At the present time and in view of the above rulings, the Tribunal does not
consider it necessary to, additionally, hold a telephone conference for
which an option is provided in section 4.9 of PO-4,” if considered
necessary by the Tribunal”.

4.3.

4.4,

4.5,

4.6.

Page 50 of 414

In view of other commitments of the members of the Tribunal, the only
possible date on which Mr. Haigh and the chairman would be available for
a telephone conference on any further details would be Saturday 15
September. But Prof. Lebedev, who is travelling, is not sure he could join
in.

If the Parties agree that a telephone conference is still necessary and if
they are available on that day, they are invited to arrange a telephone
conference for that day which, in view of the time differences involved,
should start at 15:00 hours Paris time on 15 September.

If it turns out that the Parties are not available on that date, the Tribunal
will issue PO-5 taking into account any notifications and comments
received from the Parties.

At the end of the January hearing, the Tribunal will consult with the
Parties whether a one day hearing should be set for final pleadings in
April 2013.

2. Procedural Steps before the Hearing

2.1. Claimants are authorized to submit, by 21 September 2012, the new documents
mentioned in its letter dated 14 September 2012. If Respondent wishes to submit
any new documents in rebuttal to these documents, it may do so by 27 September

2012.

2.2. In view of the great number of exhibits submitted by the Parties and in order to
facilitate references and using these exhibits at the Hearing and to avoid that each
member of the Tribunal has to bring all of them to the Hearing, the Parties are

On 23 September 2012, Claimants wrote in response to Respondent’s request to

On 28 September 2012, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties in reference to
Respondent’s applications of 24 and 27 September. The Tribunal indicated that the
application to exclude documents would be decided after the Tribunal has had an
opportunity to discuss it at the beginning of the hearing. The Tribunal invited
Claimants to indicate, at the beginning of the hearing, the specific parts of the

documents submitted on 21 September 2012. Respondent stated, however, that its

in exchange for Mr. Rakhimov being allowed to submit a third witness statement
on the matter.

The Tribunal also confirms its earlier rulings on the form and

following.

As is clear from the earlier rulings of the Tribunal, the hearing in
January is strictly limited to matters of QUANTUM.

The Parties are invited to prepare their presentations and
examination of witnesses and experts at the hearing accordingly.
Any parts of submissions or any evidence going beyond that limit
will not be considered by the Tribunal. In so far as the Parties
disagree in this regard, they may explain their positions at the
hearing and the Tribunal will take that into account.

On 18 December 2012, Suvi Lappalainen of the SCC wrote to the Parties. In
reference to the correspondence between the Tribunal and the Parties about
appointing an Administrative Secretary, the SCC decided that additional advances
in the amount of EUR 60 000 shall be paid in equal shares and will cover the fee of
the secretary. The Parties were requested to make payment by 2 January 2013.

On 18 December 2012, Claimants requested that Respondent provide the
documentation or data relied upon in the expert reports submitted on 1 December
2012, pursuant to Art. 5(2)(e) IBA Rules. Claimants pointed out that Respondent
had already failed to provide such information earlier in the procedure, requiring a
procedural order to be issued. Claimants argued that they are highly prejudiced by
Respondent’s failure to provide this documentation, since it hinders their trial
preparation.

On 31 December 2012, Claimants informed Respondent and the Tribunal that, on
17 December 2012, Claimants entered into a Sharing Agreement with the holders
of the majority of the notes issued by Tristan Oil Limited.

On 2 January 2013, Claimants sought instruction from the Tribunal that
Respondent is not excused from bringing Mr. Mynbayev and Mr. Suleymenov to
the Quantum Hearing.

On 2 January 2013, Claimants submitted Claimants’ Application to Compel
Production to the Tribunal. Therein, Claimants requested the production of four
documents that the Tribunal ordered produced in PO-2. Claimants requested that
the Tribunal draw specific adverse inferences against Respondent, should
Respondent fail to produce these documents.

On 3 January 2013, the Arbitration Institute of the SCC notified the Tribunal and
the Parties that payment of 30 000 Euro had been made by Claimants, and that 30
000 from Respondent was still outstanding. Later that day, Respondent confirmed
that payment had been made.

On 4 January 2013, Respondent submitted Respondent’s Application for
Postponement of the Hearing on Quantum. Respondent also requested that the
Tribunal grant it leave to reply to Claimants’ “Application to Compel Production”
and to submit a response to the Sharing Agreement and to dismiss Claimants’
Application to Compel Production.

On 7 January 2013, Claimants submitted their Opposition to Respondent’s
Application for Postponement of Hearing on Quantum.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 62 of 415
Page 61 of 414

139. On 9 January 2013, Respondent argued that postponement of the Hearing and the
dismissal of Claimants’ “Application to Compel Production” is the only way to
safeguard procedural justice and to restore procedural equality.

140. On 10 January 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order (PO) No. 8
Regarding several Applications of the Parties, provided below:

Procedural Order (PO) No.8

Regarding several Applications of the Parties
L Introduction

The Parties have submitted several Applications before the Hearing
scheduled from 28 to 31 January 2013. As they are well-known to all
concerned, the Tribunal will not repeat or summarize these Applications or
the arguments put forward by the Parties. And, as it is in the interest of the
Parties to have these Applications decided without any delay, to avoid
longer deliberation exchanges between members of the Tribunal, this PO
will not go into any details of the Tribunal’s reasoning in dealing with the
arguments presented by the Parties. Rather, in this PO, the Tribunal will
i diately turn to its conclusions and decisions on the Appli

2. Claimants’ Application dated 2 January 2013 for Document Production

The procedure to compel document production has been concluded at a
much earlier stage of the proceedings in this case. Insofar as a Party has
not produced as ordered by the Tribunal, the consequences of such have
already been identified in section 4 of PO-2. Issuing a further order on
document production is not provided in the timetables of POs 6 and 7 and
would seriously disturb the preparation of the Hearing both for the Parties
and the Tribunal.

Therefore, this Application is dismissed. However, the Parties are free to
argue at the hearing and in their Post-Hearing Briefs in this regard.

3. Claimants’ Application dated 2 January 2013 to instruct Respondent that
it is not excused from bringing Mr. Mynbaev and Mr. Suleimenoy to the
Hearing on Quantum

The timetable of PO 6 provided that the last changes to the Parties’
requests to have witnesses of the other side attending had to be submitted
by 10 December 2012. On 20 December 2012, Claimants submitted a
further change regarding the above mentioned witnesses. Claimants point
out that Respondent has not articulated any prejudice by this late request.
However, in view of the clear timetable set by PO 6, the Tribunal
concludes that it is not appropriate to order the attendance of the two
witnesses.

Therefore, this Application is dismissed. Hi 5, Respondent is free to
bring these witnesses to the Hearing and Parties are free to submit any
arguments in this regard at the Hearing or in their Post-Hearing Briefs.

4. Claimants’ submission on 31 December 2012 of the Sharing Agreement

with Tristan Noteholders, and Respondent's request for leave to submit a

written statement thereto

The Sharing Agreement is a new development with relevance for the
Hearing on Quantum and the submission could not be filed earlier in the
procedure. Indeed, not filing it would have been inappropriate.

Therefore, the Tribunal accepts this submission. The Parties are free to
argue in this regard at the Hearing and in their Post-Hearing Briefs.

+ Respondent's Application to Postpone the Hearing on Quantum

In view of the dismissal of Claimants’ Applications in sections 2 and 3,
above, the major reasons for this Application of Respondent are moot. The
Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent's arguments that, even in case of
such dismissals, it would be prejudiced in its preparation of the Hearing.
As provided above, the Parties are free to submit further arguments in this
regard at the Hearing and in their Post-Hearing Briefs. For the same
reason, the late submission of the Sharing Agreement does not justify a
postponement of the Hearing. After the bifurcated and very long procedure
in this case, a postponement of the hearing (which would probably delay
the procedure for at least several months in order to find a new hearing
period at which all concerned would be available) could only be justified
for absolutely compelling reasons. In view of the above considerations and
conclusions, such reasons do not exist.

Therefore, this Application is dismissed. However, again, the Parties may
submit further arguments in this regard at the Hearing and in their Post-
Hearing Briefs.

On 11 January 2013, Respondent made a Procedural Objection regarding the
Tribunal’s decision to dismiss Respondent’s Application for Postponement of the
Hearing on Quantum.

On 11 January 2013, Claimants and Respondent provided the Tribunal
information regarding the Hearing on Quantum, pursuant to PO-6 and PO-7.

On 18 January 2013, the SCC informed the Tribunal that the additional advance
on costs has been paid as ordered.

On 18 January 2013, Claimants requested authorization from the Tribunal to
submit documents into evidence in advance of the Quantum Hearing.

On 19 January 2013, the Tribunal invited Respondent to submit comments on
Claimants’ Applications of 18 January 2013 by 22 January 2013.

On 22 January 2013, Respondent (1) requested that the Tribunal deny Claimants’
request for leave to submit new documents, (2) proposed the order of witness and
expert examination, (3) requested the Tribunal’s guidance on whether the presence
of Mr. Sachsalber would be necessary at the Hearing, (4) requested that Ms. Hardin
appear at the Hearing, and (5) remarked on proposed corrections to the valuation
experts’ testimony.

On 23 January 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order (PO) No. 9

Regarding further Applications of the Parties and further Details of the
Hearing (PO-9), provided below:

Procedural Order (PO) No.9
Regarding further Applications of the Parties
and further Details of the Hearing
1 Introduction

By letters dated 11, 18, and 22 January 2013, the Parties have submitted several

further Applications and some information and suggestions regarding the conduct

of the Hearing scheduled from 28 to 31 January 2013. As they are well-known to
all concerned, the Tribunal will not repeat or summarize these submissions or the
arguments put forward by the Parties. And, as it is in the interest of the Parties to
have these matters decided without any delay, to avoid the need of longer
deliberation exchanges between members of the Tribunal, this PO will not go into
any details of the Tribunal’s reasoning in considering the arguments presented by
the Parties. Rather, in this PO, the Tribunal will immediately turn to its
conclusions and decisions.

2. Claimants’ Application dated 18 January 2013 for leave_to_submit
certain documents

The submission of a considerable number of further documents just a few days
before the hearing would seriously disturb the preparation of the Hearing, both for
the Parties and the Tribunal, and would not provide Respondent sufficient time to
evaluate the documents, formulate replies, and try to find any rebuttal evidence.
The Sharing Agreement has already been accepted by section 4 of PO-8 and, as
mentioned in section I of Respondent’s letter of 22 January 2013, has been
available to Respondent since 31 December 2012.

Therefore, with the exception of the admission of the Sharing Agreement, this
Application is dismissed. However, the Parties are free to argue at the hearing
and in their Post-Hearing Briefs in this regard.

3. Respondent’s_ Application to submit a two-page note correcting minor
errors in Deloitte’s valuation report of 30 November 2012.

Since such a note would be more convenient for all concerned than oral

corrections at the beginning of the examination of the expert, the submission is
admitted.

4. Agenda of the Hearing

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 65 of 415

Hearing, witnesses are invited by the presenting Party or
asked to attend at the request of the other Party, the
presenting Party may introduce the witness for up to 5
minutes, and add a short direct examination on issues, if
any, which have occurred after the last written statement
of the witness has been submitted. The remaining hearing
time shall be reserved for cross-examination and re-direct
examination, as well as for questions by the Arbitrators.

Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties: first, there will be

the Examination of Claimants’ fact witnesses in the order

set by Claimants:

For each witness, the examination will be conducted as
follows:

a) Affirmation of witness to tell the truth

b) Short introduction by Claimants

c) Cross-examination by Respondent.

d) Re-direct examination by Claimants, but only on
issues raised in cross-examination

e) Re-cross examination by Respondent but only on
issues raised in re-direct examination

A Remaining questions by members of the Tribunal,

but they may raise questions at any time.

Examination of Respondent’s fact witnesses in the order
set by Respondent:

pattern vice versa as mentioned for Claimants’ witnesses.

6. Remaining questions by the members of the Tribunal, if any.
7. Discussion _of the further procedure, taking into account the

timetable already established by PO-6, and any new developments
and submissions after that PO.

Certain Further Details of the Conduct of the Hearing

The Tribunal has taken note of the Parties’ communications regarding the
attendance of witnesses and experts.

Unless, in reply to Respondent’s letter of 22 January 2013, Claimants
notify Respondent no later than 12 noon Friday 25 January 2013 Paris
time, that they insist on orally examining Mr. Sachsalber, Mr. Powell and
Mr. Rhodes, these persons do not have to attend the hearing.

In view of the explanation in Respondent's letter of 22 January 2013, the

On 20 February 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order (PO) No. 10
Regarding the Further Procedure:

Procedural Order (PO) No. 10
Regarding the Further Procedure

L Introduction

dd This PO contains rulings resulting from the discussion between the Parties
and the Tribunal at the January Hearing. On 6 February 2013, a draft of
this PO was circulated to the Parties for comments within one week.
Taking into account the discussion at the hearing and the comments
received from the Parties, this PO is now issued in its final form.

 

1.2 The Tribunal records that, at the end of the hearing, Claimants agreed to
provide, by Monday 4 February 2013, the 3D Seismic data discussed at the
hearing and the related documentation to Respondent.

2. Respondent's Applications dated 13 February 2013.

2.1. In reply to the Tribunal’s invitation to comment on the Tribunal’s draft of
PO-10, on 13 February 2013, Respondent filed a submission which
included the following Applications:

(a) Allow for an opportunity to submit an expert report on the new
subject matter introduced by Claimants within a period of three
months as of submission of the full data information and
documents as specified below;

(b) Provide for a hearing with the opportunity to address the new
subject matter introduced by Claimants, in particular through
examination of the parties’ experts and witnesses;

(c) Order Claimants to submit data, information and documents as
specified below;
(d) Allow Respondent to submit further witness and/or expert

testimony relating to the new subject matter introduced by
Claimants as specified below;

(e) The proposed periods for the two rounds of post-hearing briefs
and the oral closing submissions shall be maintained and shall
commence after the hearing on the new subject matter introduced
by Claimants

91 In addition, Respondent seeks clarification as to the scope of the
first round of Post Hearing Briefs as specified in the second bullet
point of section 2.1 and the admissibility of new documents as
specified in the last bullet point of section 2.1.

On 14 February 2013, the Tribunal invited Claimants to submit any
comments they may have. On 16 February 2013, Claimants filed a
submission which included the following request:

Claimants firmly oppose the bulk of the relief requested in Respondent's
Submission. Claimants do acknowledge that the Munaibay 3D information
has only recently been analyzed by Ryder Scott and GCA, and Claimants
do not object to cross-examination of the quantum experts regarding, and
limited to, the Munaibay 3D infc ion — if that e is dul
in a manner that does not delay the procedural calendar.

Thereafter, the Parties filed further submissions providing further
arguments and maintaining their above requests.

As they are well-known to all concerned, the Tribunal will not repeat or
summarize these submissions of the Parties or the arguments put forward
by the Parties. Indeed, many of the arguments presented in the most recent
submissions by Respondent and, in reply, by Claimants, were already
presented during the January hearing and taken into account in the
Tribunal’s deliberations after that hearing and in the draft PO-10 resulting

from these deliberations which was sent to the Parties for comments. While

all arguments of the Parties have been considered by the Tribunal, in this
PO the Tribunal will thus focus on the arguments it considers
determinative for its conclusions and decisions.

It is recalled that, according to Art. 19 SCC Rules, the Tribunal may
conduct the arbitration in such a manner as it considers appropriate
(19.1), but shall conduct the procedure in an expeditious manner (19.2). It
is further recalled that, for the same purpose, Art. 37 SCC Rules provides a
time limit of 6 months for the final award, and that this time limit has
already been extended considerably in the present case.

The Tribunal’s duty to conduct the procedure in an impartial manner (Art.
19.2) includes an obligation to take into account the interests of both
Claimants and Respondent. In that context, obviously, due process does
not mean that every application of a party must be accepted. In particular,
it is the Tribunal’s authority and duty to decide on the most efficient
consideration of evidence in a given phase of the procedure as long as
both sides have an opportunity to present their case.

In the present case, there have been long and many opportunities for the
Parties to submit evidence and two hearings to orally examine witnesses
and experts presented by the Parties.

In the judgment of the Tribunal, any new information and evidence that
became available to the Parties before and at the hearing on quantum, can
be commented by the Parties in a following written procedure without the
need for another evidentiary hearing. Therefore, the Tribunal had
suggested, in its draft for this PO

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 71 of 415

Page 70 of 414
* a first round of Post-Hearing Briefs within a period of more than
two months after the hearing,
* a hearing for oral closing arguments three weeks later,
* a final round of Post-Hearing Briefs within a period of one further

month after that hearing.

2.9. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that the hearing scheduled for 2 May
2013 could also be used for an oral examination of the technical experts of
both sides on the update of the Munaibay 3D information. The Tribunal
considers that these further three rounds provide the Parties more than
ample opportunities to evaluate, comment, and rebut whatever they
consider new information and evidence that became available before, at,
and immediately after the hearing on quantum.

2.10. Taking all these considerations into account, Respondent's Applications
are therefore dismissed in so far as they are not covered by the timetable
set hereafter.

3. New Timetable

The timetable originally set in PO-6 is changed and amended as follows:

3.1. By 8 April 2013, the Parties shall simultaneously submit their respective
Ist round Post Hearing Briefs to the Tribunal:

e Regarding all issues addressed in the October 2012 and January
2013 hearings,

. Regarding any submissions and documents admitted by the
Tribunal and filed by the other side after the October 2012
hearing.

e The Tribunal recalls that, according to section 4.5 of PO-4 and

section 1.2 of PO-6, no new evidence may be submitted unless
authorized by the Tribunal. However, the Parties may attach to the
Post Hearing Briefs the following:

* As provided in § 3.3.1 of the Chairman’s letter of 11
September 2012, comments of their experts on issues of
jurisdiction and liability, but only regarding any new
developments or issues which these have not addressed in
their earlier reports,

* updates of the Reports of Claimants’ and Respondent's
technical experts and quantum experts heard at the
hearing on quantum,

3.2.

3.3.

Page 71 of 414

new documents, but only in rebuttal to submissions and
documents filed by the other side filed after the October
hearing and admitted by the Tribunal.

As a precaution, the Tribunal notifies the Parties that it does not
intend to grant any extensions of the above deadline for
submissions, since the following period until the Final Hearing on
2 May 2013 is required for the preparation of all concerned, and a
postponement of that hearing would lead to unacceptable further
delays in the procedure.

On 2 and 3 May 2013, a two day Final Hearing will be held at the ICC
Hearing Centre in Paris. The Tribunal has made a provisional reservation
of rooms for this hearing at the Centre. The Parties are invited to confirm
this reservation with the Centre in the same manner as they did for the two
earlier hearings. Details of the conduct of this Hearing will be set by the
Tribunal after consultation with the Parties closer to the time of the
hearing.

In the morning of 2 May, the Parties’ technical experts, Ryder Scott and
GCA, will be examined, but exclusively limited to the update of the
Munaibay 3D information. Unless the Parties agree otherwise, this
examination will be conducted by conferencing similar to the manner used
at the January hearing.

Starting in the afternoon of 2 May, the Parties may present a first round of
final oral arguments.

In the morning of 3 May 2013, the Parties may present a second round of
final oral arguments.

Further details of the hearing will be set by the Tribunal after the Parties’
submissions have been received by 8 April 2013.

By 3 June 2013, the Parties shall simultaneously submit their respective
2" Round Post Hearing Briefs, but only addressing issues in rebuttal to
the other side’s 1“ Round Post Hearing Brief and regarding issues
addressed in the hearing of 2 and 3 May 2013.

  

As earlier listings partly overlapped or were incomplete since focusing on
one hearing only, with these 2" round submissions, the Parties shall file:

e Final complete lists of all witness statements and expert reports
including their updates and attachments if any,

e Final complete lists of all documents submitted or handed out at
the hearings with their exhibit numbers,

e Hyperlinked versions of the above lists on two new master USB
devices, one from Claimants and one from Respondent, enabling
easy access to all statements, reports, and documents listed.

4. Questions

At any time during or after the above timetable, the Tribunal may address the
Parties inviting comments on specific questions on which the Tribunal feels further
clarifications may be helpful.

On 21 February 2013, the Parties attempted to resolve issues with the 2D data.

On 22 February 2013, Respondent sent Respondent’s opening Presentation for the
Hearing on Quantum in PDF format, to the Tribunal.

On 6 March 2013, Respondent filed a Procedural Objection with the Tribunal.

By email of 7 March 2013, the Chairman, on behalf of the Tribunal, invited
Claimants to respond to this objection, by 22 March 2013.

On 14 March 2013, Respondent submitted the Squire Sanders Legal Due
Diligence Report, the PwC Financial and Tax Due Diligence Report, the KMG EP
Presentation on Asset Assessment as at September 2008, and the RBS Presentation
on Asset Assessment as at 31 July 2009, as listed in Exhibit R 41.1 and as
requested by Claimants, to Claimants and to the Tribunal.

Claimants submitted their response to Respondent’s procedural objection on 22
March 2013.

On 8 April 2013, the Parties simultaneously submitted their respective first Post
Hearing Briefs and related Expert Reports to the Tribunal.

On 12 April 2013, the Tribunal issued PO-11, provided below:

Procedural Order (PO) No.11
Regarding Further Details of the Hearing

L Earlier Rulings
The Tribunal recalls its earlier rulings in section 3.2 of PO-10:

On 2 and 3 May 2013, a two day Final Hearing will be held at the ICC Hearing
Centre in Paris. The Tribunal has made a provisional reservation of rooms for this
hearing at the Centre. The Parties are invited to confirm this reservation with the
Centre in the same manner as they did for the two earlier hearings. Details of the
conduct of this Hearing will be set by the Tribunal after consultation with the
Parties closer to the time of the hearing.

oral arguments.

which functions will attend the hearing from their respective sides.

2.3. In view of the great number of exhibits submitted by the Parties and in

Binders in A5 format of those exhibits or parts thereof on which
they intend to rely in their expert examination at this hearing,

2 May would begin at 9:30 a.m., as usual.

On 17 April 2013, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal in reference to the May
hearing.

On 18 April 2013, the Tribunal responded with the following email

As the hearing is fast approaching, the Tribunal replies without delay to
Respondent’s letter dated 17 April 2013.

Point 1 of the letter regarding the 2" Round PostHBs can be discussed at the
Hearing.

Point 2: The Tribunal encourages the Parties to make an effort similar to,
mutatis mutandis, sections 1.5 and 1.6 of PO-6:

In preparation of the examination of the experts at the 2 May Hearing, the experts
are invited to contact, either directly or with the help of the Parties, the expert from
the other side and try to agree on a short note identifying the major sub-issues on
which they agree and disagree.

The Tribunal would be grateful if, by 29 April 2013, the Parties could submit either
the notes agreed by the experts according to section 1.5 above or separate notes of
each expert in so far as they cannot agree on a joint note.

On 22 April 2012, Claimants and Respondent each wrote to the Tribunal in
reference to the Hearing and explained procedural objections against the other.
Respondent also submitted an updated translation of R-360.

On 24 April 2013, Respondent wrote in response to Claimants’ letter of 22 April
2013. In a separate email, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had made grids
prepared by GCA for its 3D seismic analysis available to Claimants through an
FTP server and provided the Tribunal that data.

On 24 April 2013, Claimants responded to Respondent’s letter of the same date.
On 25 April 2013, Respondent replied to Claimants’ letter of 24 April 2013.

On 25 April 2013, Claimants and Respondent provided the Tribunal a list of
hearing attendees.

On 29 April 2013, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal and objected to Claimants’
amendments to the transcript.

On 29 April 2013, Respondent sent the Joint Issue List of Ryder Scott and GCA
for the testimony at the hearing to the Tribunal.

On 1 May 2013, Claimants wrote in response to Respondent’s letter concerning the
issue of corrections to the hearing transcripts.

A hearing was held in Paris from 2 — 3 May 2013. Reginald Smith, Kenneth
Fleuriet, Kevin Mohr, James Toher, Heloise Herve, Amy Roebuck Frey, Alexandra
Kotlyachova and Valerya Subocheva of King & Spalding appeared on behalf of
Claimants. Dr. Patricia Nacimiento, Max Stein and Sven Lange of Norton Rose
LLP and Joseph Tirado of Winston & Strawn LLP appeared on behalf of
Respondent. A transcript was made.

At the end of his introduction at the start of the hearing, the Chairman informed the
Parties of the following rulings from the Tribunal’s deliberations prior to the
hearing (quoted from the manuscript read by the Chairman, Tr. May 2013 pp. 4 —
5):

By their recent letters, the Parties addressed the following issues in particular:

I. Regarding the Testimony of Mr. Wood (Respondent’s expert from GCA):

Taking into account [...]

. section 3.2 of PO-10,
. and the arguments submitted by the Parties,
. and the Experts’ Joint List of Issues submitted by Respondent by

its mail of 30 April 2013,

the Tribunal has concluded that

. Mr. Wood can be examined at this hearing

. But that the 2nd Round of Post-Hearing Briefs provides an
opportunity for the Parties and their experts to submit further

comments on the issues addressed.

2. Regarding Comments on expert reports and Claimant’s objection to the
2nd Deloitte report:

The Tribunal has taken note that, at the end of their letters of 24 April, the
Parties agree that, with their 2nd Round Post-Hearing briefs, the Parties
may submit further comments

. Both by Ryder Scott and GCA

. And by FTI and Deloitte.

In fact, taking into account also the Tribunal’s letter of 11 September 2012
admitting such comments as well for the experts at the Hearing on

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 78 of 415
Page 77 of 414

Jurisdiction and Liability, this means that comments by all the experts may
be submitted with the Parties’ 2nd Round Post-Hearing Briefs, but only in
rebuttal to the previous reports by the respective experts from the other
side.

And from all these rulings it is obvious and confirmed by the Tribunal that
these 2nd Round submissions are the final round of submissions, and that
NO further comments may be submitted thereafter either by the Parties or
by their experts.

However, in case it turns out that the Tribunal has further questions to
the Parties, the Tribunal may address the Parties during the time of its
deliberations.

3. Regarding Transcript Corrections

The Tribunal points out that corrections are only necessary in so far as the
transcript is incorrect with relevance to substantial issues.

Regarding the first two hearings, the Parties had ample time to examine
the transcripts while drafting their Ist Round Post-Hearing Briefs.
Regarding the very short final hearing, such examination can easily be
done while drafting their 2nd Round Post-Hearing Briefs which are due by
3 June 2013.

The Tribunal encourages the Parties to agree on a timely procedure for
joint corrections. If that cannot be achieved, each Party may submit
suggested corrections to the other side by 15 May 2013.

If or in so far as the Parties cannot agree on joint proposals, each Party
may submit, together with its 2nd Round Post-Hearing Briefs, its suggested
corrections and conuments on the suggestions of the other side. The
Tribunal will examine such suggestions and take them into account in so
far as they are relevant for its conclusions.

 

In view of the above, an extension of the date set for the Post-Hearing
Briefs is NOT necessary in the view of the Tribunal, but also not possible
as the planning of the Tribunal for its deliberations shortly after the
deadline for the 2nd Round Post-Hearing Briefs would otherwise be
delayed considerably.

4. If the Parties feel that any other procedural issue has to be addressed at
the beginning of this Hearing, this can be done in the short Opening
Statements which follow now.

 

189. After brief opening statements by Mr. Smith and Dr. Nacimiento, respectively, the
Tribunal heard testimony from Mr. Michael Nowicki, Dr. Stephen Wright, and Mr.
Mike Wood. The three experts also testified through witness conferencing.

190. As recorded in the transcript (page 100), at the end of the Hearing the Chairman of
the Tribunal raised the following question:

The Tribunal has, of course, taken note of the procedural objections that were put
on record at an earlier stage, and we take it that these will be maintained. So my
usual question at the end of a hearing only is: are there any further procedural
objections at this stage regarding the way the Tribunal has conducted this
procedure?

The Parties replied as follows:
For Claimant MR SMITH: None from the Claimants.
For Respondent DR NACIMIENTO: And none from Respondent.

On 29 May 2013, the Chairman, on behalf of the Tribunal, sent a letter to the
Arbitration Institute of the SCC, suggesting that the SCC extend the deadline for
the issuance of the Award to 31 December 2013.

On 3 June 2013, Respondent sent its Second Round Post-Hearing Brief (RPHB
2) to the Tribunal. Respondent also submitted Deloitte GmbH 2™ Supplemental
Expert Report, GCA Fourth Expert Report, the Second Expert Report of Tomas
Balco, the Third Expert Report of Prof. Didenko, and the Third Expert Report of
Prof. Ilyassova to the Tribunal.

On 3 June 2013, Claimants submitted their Second Round Post-Hearing Brief
(CPHB 2) to the Tribunal. Claimants also submitted the Third Maggs Report, the
Third Suleymenov Report, The Second Malinovsky Opinion, the Corrected Final
Hearing Transcripts, the Fourth Expert Report of Howard Rosen (FTI), the Fourth
Expert Report of the Ryder Scott Company, and a photo array of all witnesses.

By letter of 10 June 2013, the Arbitration Institute of the SCC decided that the
Final Award shall be rendered by 2 January 2014.

On 1 July 2013, Claimants and Respondent each submitted their respective
Statements on Costs to the Tribunal.

On 8 July 2013, Claimants and Respondent each submitted their responses to the
Costs Submissions submitted by the other side.

On 12 December 2013, the Arbitration Institute of the SCC issued its decision on
costs, recorded later in this Award.

. Factual Background

The Tribunal has considered all of the facts presented by the Parties, even if not
explicitly stated below. This section summarizes the facts and events leading to the
current dispute, as presented by the Parties in their submissions and testimony and
without prejudice to the relevance the Tribunal may give to facts and issues. More

FI. General Background Information

Natural hydrocarbon resources are one of the principal assets of the Republic.
Within the next ten years, Kazakhstan will be among the top five oil producers,
holding 30 billion barrels of proven oil and 85 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.
KPM and TNG were important to the economic framework of and have played a
strategic role in the Mangystau region’s economy, providing 80% of the fuel
needed for the local power plant and employing a considerable number of people.
(R-I {if 4.1, 31.52; R-II { 322).

The Borankol and Tolkyn fields are approximately 50 km apart in the Mangystau
region. Aktau, the capital of the Mangystau region, is approximately 400 and 500
km from the Borankol and the Tolkyn fields, respectively. The closest town to the
Borankol field is Opornaya, which is approximately 15 km away. (C-I{[ 52).

The Respondent is the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, which is the
sovereign body responsible for managing the investment in and exploitation of
Kazakhstan’s natural resources. (R-I J 4.4).

Claimant Anatolie Stati is a natural citizen of Moldova and Romania who has
invested in Turkmenistan since 1995. Based on his testimony and the testimony of
Prof. Olcott at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability, Respondent argues that
Anatolie Stati was a “novice” in the oil and gas industry when he entered
Kazakhstan. Respondent presents a history of the Stati family’s involvement in
Moldova’s politics, as well as in the politics and businesses of other states.
Claimants and Respondent agree that Anatolie Stati is not a political opponent of
President Nazarbayev. (C-0 {[ 10; C-II { 79; R-II {{{[ 24 — 33, 38 — 39, 267; RPHB |
ql 21, 118).

Claimant Gabriel Stati is a natural citizen of Moldova and Romania and is the son
of Anatolie Stati. (C-0 { 11; C-II {79 - 80).

Claimant Ascom Group S.A. is a joint stock company incorporated under the laws
of Moldova, with headquarters in Moldova. Ascom’s operational subsidiaries were
located in Kazakhstan. The Parties dispute whether Anatolie Stati owned 100% of
Ascom, which owned 100% of KPM or that Ascom has substantial business
activities in or is controlled from Moldova. Respondent argued that Anatolie Stati
is Ascom’s 100% shareholder. (C-0 {{ 12; C-II {Jf 85, 86, 95, 128; R-II {J 51 — 54;
RPHB 1 {{ 124).

Claimant Terra Raf Trans Traiding Ltd. is a limited liability company incorporated
under the laws of Gibraltar. (C-0 | 13; C-II { 96, 129; R-I{.9.81, 14.9).

Respondent states that Tristan Oil Ltd. (“Tristan”) is an affiliate of KPM and TNG
and is 100 % owned by Anatolie Stati. Tristan was created as a special purpose
vehicle with the purpose of issuing notes. (R-II { 728).

Mr. Lungu is the Executive Vice President and CFO of Tristan and the Commercial
Vice President of Ascom. (RPHB 1 { 138).

TNG is a Kazakh company that owned the subsoil use rights to the Tolkyn field
and the Tabyl Block pursuant to Contracts 210 and 302 on Exploration and
Extraction of Hydrocarbons at the “Tolkyn” deposit and the Tabyl Block
(Mangystau Oblast), executed between the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan
on Investments and TNG, and dated 12 August and 31 July 1998, respectively.
Contract Nos. 210 and 302 were issued pursuant to the Licenses for the right to
explore and/or exploit the hydrocarbons, Series MG No. 242-D (oil) and MG No.
243-D (oil), both dated 4 December 1997 and issued by the Government. (C-0 {|
18, partially quoted, citations omitted; C-I {J 3, 47; R-I'{ 13.55).

KPM owned the subsoil use rights to the Borankol field pursuant to Contract 305
on Exploration and Extraction of Hydrocarbons at the “Borankol” deposit
(Mangystau Oblast), executed between the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan
on Investments and KPM, and dated 30 March 1999. Contract 305 was issued
pursuant to the license for the right to use subsoil, Series MG No. 309-D (oil) dated
23 May 1997, issued by the Government to KPM. (C-0 {[ 16, quoted, citations
omitted; C-I 9] 3, 42; R-I {| 13.2).

Over 90% of KPM’s and TNG’s work force was comprised of local Kazakh
citizens, nearly 1,000 of which were employed on a permanent basis. (CPHB | {1
123).

Respondent considers KMG to be two separate, distinct entities: KazMunaiGaz
Exploration Production (KMG EP) and KazMunaiGaz National Company (KMG
NC). Respondent explains that KMG EP is not a state entity, but is a commercial
entity listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange.
KMG NC isa state entity that considers the social and economic implications of an
acquisition to the Republic as a whole. (R-II { 350 — 351; RPHB 2 { 10).

Mr. Timur Kulibayev is President Nazarbayev’s son-in-law and the Chairman of
KMG NC, but not of KMG EP. (C-I{ 189, R-II { 352).

F.Il. Timeline of Events

As will be seen later in this Award, in the present dispute the timeline of events is
of particular importance to the considerations and conclusions by the Tribunal. It
is, therefore, provided in much greater detail than would normally be necessary.
The following timeline records events mentioned by the Parties in their
submissions, without prejudice to the relevance the Tribunal may attach to each
item.

The Borankol structure was discovered in 1959, with test drilling finalized in 1973.
The Tolkyn field structure was discovered in 1992 (C-I {J 42, 46).

KPM was established as a closed JSC joint venture / non-commercial organization
on 24 March 1997. The companies Polmak Sondazh Sanaii A.Sh. (from the
Republic of Turkey) and CJSC Joint Kazakh-Estonian-Irish Company Aksai were
the founders and equal 50% owners of the company. (R-I {[f[ 13.1 — 13.3).

On 27 January 1999, Promtorgbank JSC Industrial and Trade Bank transferred 800
TNG shares to Kainar LTD. As a result, a controlling stake was acquired and
permission for the transfer was required. Respondent never gave permission.
(RPHB 2 {[ 273 citing R-18).

On 29 March 1999, Shagyrly-Shomyshty LLP transferred 1000 TNG shares to
Kainar LTD. As a result, a controlling stake was acquired and permission for the
transfer was required. Respondent never gave permission. (RPHB 2 {[ 273 citing
R-18).

Claimants began investigating investment opportunities in Kazakhstan in 1999.
(C-I 42).

On 18/19 November 1999, KPM submitted a request to the Agency of the Republic
of Kazakhstan on Investment for consent to Ascom Group’s acquisition of a 62%
share of KPM. (C-I{ 45; C-II qf] 169, 165; RPHB 2 {[ 275).

On 9 December 1999, Ascom purchased the 62% share in KPM. Respondent
disputes the legality of this purchase. (R-II { 117).

On 13 December 1999, KPM was reorganized from a non-commercial to a
commercial organization. Claimants dispute this and state that KPM was always a
commercial entity. They suggest that the change could have been to remedy a
registration error by the Republic. (R-I J 13.12; C-II{ 155).

On 24 January 2000, KPM obtained a national identification number with respect
to the initial issuance of its shares. (C-II J 149).

Claimants’ interest in TNG and the TNG Subsoil Use Contracts began with
Ascom’s acquisition of a 75% interest on 17 May 2000. Claimants requested and
received consent for the transfer. The State believed its pre-emptive rights were
inapplicable to the transfer. (C-0 {{ 19).

Respondent acknowledges that, in relation to the TNG shares, Claimants have
produced evidence of certain payments being made by Ascom to Kaihar TOO in
the amounts of USD 421,000 and USD 1,137,000 at the time of the acquisition on
30 May 2000, but notes that this investment was made by Ascom and not Terra
Raf. Respondent states that the formal shares themselves were purchased for USD
189,185 on 16 January 2009. Respondent states that this discrepancy has not been
explained by Claimants. (R-I {] 14.3 (stating that the amount was USD 190,000); R-
Iq 118).

On 30 May 2000, Kainar LTD transferred 3050 TNG shares to Ascom S.A. As a
result, a controlling stake was acquired and permission for the transfer was
required. Respondent never gave permission. (RPHB 2 {{ 273 citing R-18).

As of July 2000, Claimants were the operators for both the Borankol and Tolkyn
fields. (C-I] 49).

The MEMR was created on 13 December 2000. (C-II { 167).

KazRosGas LLP was created in 2001 pursuant to an agreement between the
governments of Kazakhstan and Russia. It was designated as the single operator to
buy, sell, and market Kazakhstan’s export gas. Gazprom owns 50% of KasRosGas.
Domestic producers that wish to export gas must contract with Gazprom. (R-I {[
49.13; R-III {fj 253 - 262).

In 2001, NIPI Neftegaz issued the Borankol Raw Materials Base Project, a design
of KPM’s gathering and treatment facility as a single technological process.
(CPHB 2 {| 74; RPHB 2 {{ 204).

On 25 April 2001, State Expert Review of Projects approved construction of
KPM’s pipelines, including the 18 km pipeline that is at issue. (CPHB 2 4] 74).

On 4 March 2002, the State Inspection for Emergency Situations, the Fire Safety
Supervising Agency, the State Sanitary Surveillance Department, the Ministry of
Environmental Protection for the Mangystau Region, the State Inspection for
Architecture and Construction, and NIPI Neftegaz approved the commissioning of
KPM’s 18-kilometer pipeline. No mention was ever made of that pipeline being a
trunk pipeline. (C-II { 272; CPHB 2 { 74; RPHB 2 {| 214).

On 13 March 2002, Ascom transferred its 75% interest in TNG to its subsidiary,
Gheso S.A. (“Gheso”). (C-0 | 19; C-I {{[ 50, 140 et seq.) Claimants did not obtain
consent from either the Government or MEMR for this transfer. (R-I { 13.28; R-II
{| 158; RPHB 2 { 273).

On 30 April 2002, Kainar LTD transferred 950 shares of TNG to Gheso.
Claimants state that they received consent, and provide the Tribunal with Exhibit
C-134, which Claimants say TNG received from the MEMR, granting permission
for the share transfer. (C-II { 168). In response, Respondent states that consent
should never have been granted without a waiver of the Republic’s pre-emptive
right and that Exhibit C-134 cannot be deemed as consent by the appropriate body,
as Claimants allege. (R-I { 13.28, RPHB {{ 273).

On 3 May 2002, Production-Commercial Firm Bobro and Anavi respectively
transferred 100 and 200 TNG shares to Gheso, resulting in Gheso becoming the
100% owner of TNG. Respondent states that Claimants did not obtain consent
from either the Government or MEMR for these transfers. (R-I{ 13.28).

In September 2002, KPM and TNG applied to the MEMR for licenses covering its
new gathering system. On 26 September 2002, MEMR issued the requisite
licenses to KPM and TNG for their production, treatment, and transportation
activities. (C-I { 83; C-II {| 274; CPHB 2 74).

On 12 May 2003, Gheso transferred its 100% interest in TNG to Terra Raf. (C-0 {|
20; C-I { 50; CPHB 2 {[ 117). Respondent states that Claimants did not obtain
consent for this transfer. (R-I {13.28 — 13.29).

Claimants state that the transfer was complete on 28 May 2003 when TNG’s share
registrar, Zerde, registered the Gheso-Terra Raf share transfer. (CPHB 2 {{ 117).
Respondent disagrees — a transfer cannot be validly registered under Kazakh law
without consent being obtained under Art. 53(1). (RPHB 2 {{ 273).

Starting in 2004, Claimants conducted the initial seismic work on the Contract 302
properties. (C-I { 66).

In 2004, Claimants had discussion with GazImpex, a gas-exporting company which
Claimants allege is controlled by Mr. Kulibayev, about the sale of a 35% stake in
TNG. The parties were never able to reach agreement because Claimants valued
TNG at USD 567 million, while GazImpex valued it at USD 27.8 — 32.9 million.
(C-II {| 375). Respondent states that Claimants have failed to prove that Mr.
Kulibayev owned or controlled GazImpex and argue that these negotiations are
irrelevant to this arbitration. (R-II {J 341 — 344).

Respondent states that Claimants have produced a document identified as C-514,
dated 15 September 2004, which expressly refers to Ascom being the owner of
TNG as of that date. Claimants provide no explanation of how this could be the
case, given that by this point, Terra Raf had acquired TNG from Gheso.
Respondent states that, according to Claimants at C-I | 50, the last time Ascom
owned TNG was in 2002. (R-II {{ 173).

In November 2004, Ascom acquired the remaining 38% interest in KPM.
Respondent acknowledges that Claimants have provided evidence of USD 9
million having been provided by Ascom and Terra Raf for this purchase. (C-I J 45;
C-II { 184; R-II 117).

On | December 2004, Kazakhstan passed a law giving the State a pre-emptive right
over certain transfers of subsoil users. (CPHB 2 {[ 117).

The 8 December 2004 enactment of Law No. 2-III, which amended Art. 71 of the
1996 Subsoil Use Law, gave Kazakhstan a pre-emptive right to acquire shares in
subsoil users. (C-II { 184).

In May 2005, KPM was reorganized from an OJSC to a LLP. Claimants state that
the Government approved of this change by letter. (C-I {{[ 45, 51).

On 16 May 2005, Terra Raf reorganized TNG from an OJSC to a LLP. Claimants
notified MEMR of this reorganization, and the change from TNG OJSC to TNG
LLP was memorialized in the State-executed 2006 Supplements to the TNG
Subsoil Use Contracts. (C-0 {{ 20; C-I'{ 50; CPHB 2 { 117). Respondent states that
when TNG was reorganized from an OJSC to a LLP in 2005, there was an error:
Terra Raf never was a lawful shareholder of TNG and could not carry out its
reorganization from an OJSC to a LLP. (R-I fff 13.32; 13.45).

After the alleged reorganizations, KPM and TNG applied to re-license their
pipelines. MEMR re-issued licenses on 5 August 2005. (C-I {{ 82; C-II {{ 274;
CPHB 2 {| 74).

In 2006, TNG contracted with Vitol to construct and operate the LPG Plant. The
Parties dispute the amounts invested. (C-I {{{[ 62, 64; R-II { 123).

In May 2006, Claimants halted construction on the LPG Plant for financial reasons.
(C-I 64).

On 31 July 2006, the exploration period for Contract 302 was extended. Flooding
in the Caspian Sea basin, however, suspended exploration work for two years and
eight months. The MEMR extended the exploration period until 30 March 2009,
without counting this force majeure against the two permissible contractual
extensions. (C-I { 47; R-I{ 14.20).

On 19 October 2006, the State asked TNG whether Ascom had transferred any of
its interest in TNG during the period of | December 2004 to 19 October 2006.
TNG replied that Terra Raf was the sole interest holder in TNG since May 2003.
(C-0 J 21; C-I] 143; CPHB 2 117).

In 2006, Claimants began the “Bonds Project’, under which Tristan Oil (a
company under the control of Claimants), issued 3 tranches of bonds with maturity
of 1 January 2012, for a total amount of USD 531 million. The bonds were issued
at the EURO MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and were
guaranteed by KPM and TNG. The charter capital of each company at the date of
issuance of guarantees amounted to USD 50,000, i.e. 0.018% of the par bond issue.
(R-I {{f 9.59 — 9.62).

The first tranche of the Bonds Project was issued on 20 December 2006. (R-I
9.59).

On 11 January 2007, Kazakhstan adopted a new Law on Licensing, pursuant to
which the MEMR would remain the licensing authority for production activities
and operation of pipelines other than “main” or “trunk” pipelines. (C-II {{ 275;
CPHB 2 {[ 74). Since the Parties have used the terms “main” and “trunk” pipelines
interchangeably, so too shall this Award.

In early 2007, Kazakhstan approached Claimants with a proposal for the provision
of gas to KazAzot as part of a project of national priority to allow the Republic to
develop an Ammonia-Carbamide project, which required a secure gas supply. (C-I
| 58; R-I { 15.5 et seq.). Claimants state that they agreed to provide specific
volumes of gas to KazAzot, provided that Claimants would be allowed to export
specific volumes of gas at international market prices. (C-I { 58).

On 13 February 2007, Respondent notified Claimants that they had failed to obtain
consent for the 2003 transfer of Gheso’s 100% interest in TNG to Terra Raf and
that Claimants had not notified the Republic that Ascom’s shares had been
transferred to Gheso. Respondent notified Claimants that they had failed to give
the Republic the opportunity to exercise its pre-emptive right to purchase TNG.
(R-I { 13.47; RPHB 2 { 277). Respondent requested that TNG apply for
retroactive permission for the 2003 transfer and TNG complied. (C-I { 143; CPHB
24 117). Claimants state that MEMR also notified Claimants that the transfer had
been proper and the pre-emptive right was not applicable. (CPHB 2 {{ 117).

On 19 February 2007, TNG informed the MEMR that the Republic’s pre-emptive
right did not apply in February 2007. (RPHB 2 {[ 277).

On 21 February 2007, Terra Raf noted KazRosGas’s interest in acquiring a stake in
TNG, and asked KazRosGas to send a written offer. (C-II | 376). Respondent
states that this is irrelevant to this arbitration, and there is no link to the Republic.
Likewise, Claimants have not proven that Mr. Kulibayev controls this company.
(R-II {fff 341, 345).

On 7 May 2007, Claimants, the MEMR, the Governor of the Mangystau Region,
the operator of the main gas pipeline KazTransGas (a subsidiary of the national oil
company KMG), and the owner KazAzot agreed to enter into gas supply and
transport arrangements and signed a Memorandum of Understanding. Pursuant to
these arrangements, Claimants would sell certain volumes of gas at a price
substantially above the discounted prices to KazAzot (first at near-market prices,
then at the international market price after two years), and TNG, through
KazTransGas, would be allowed to export certain volumes of gas at international
market prices. Over the following year, Claimants conducted extensive
negotiations to conclude the prices, volumes, and conditions of the agreement. (C-
1459). Respondent disputes that there was any reference to the ability to sell oil in
the Memorandum of Understanding. (R-I {| 15.7).

On 14 June 2007, the second tranche in the Bonds Project was issued for USD 120
million. (R-I'{ 9.59).

On 19 June 2007, President Nazarbayev issued a Presidential decree that
transferred authority for licensing the operation of trunk pipelines from the MEMR.
to the ARNM -— the regulator and controller of activities of natural monopolies and
regulated markets. (R-II { 589). Claimants state that the MEMR (later called the
Ministry of Oil and Gas or “MOG”) remained the licensing authority for activities
related to production and to operation of pipelines other than trunk pipelines. (C-II
{{ 275). Respondent, however, states that the ARNM has the power of issuing
licenses to operate transfer gas pipelines, oil pipelines, trunk pipelines, and oil
product pipelines. It neither polices who owns trunk pipelines nor does it classify
whether a pipeline was trunk. (R-I {{ 25.2; R-II {| 544, 589; CPHB 2 74). The
Parties have acknowledged that, since 2007, competency to issue licenses in
relation to trunk pipelines lies with the ARNM. The Parties are aware that anyone
wishing to operate a trunk pipeline needs to apply for a license. (CPHB | {{ 155, R-
T{ 26.9; R-II {if 464 — 465, CPHB 2 61; RPHB | {{{ 198 — 202).

On 6 December 2007, KPM and TNG each applied to the MEMR for permits to
allow the transfer of their ownership interests to Tristan Oil for the purpose of
conducting an IPO on the London Stock Exchange. (C-0 {[ 22; C-I{ 144; R-I{
9.70).

On 26 December 2007, the Kazakh Inter-institutional Committee recommended
that the MEMR (1) grant permission for the transfer and (2) waive the State’s pre-
emptive rights to purchase 100% of KPM and TNG. (C-I { 144; CPHB 2 { 117).

By letters to KPM and TNG dated 29 December 2007, the MEMR granted
permission for the transfers and expressly waived its pre-emptive rights. According
to Claimants, the State indicated that it was interested in purchasing the assets
within the IPO. (C-0 {| 22, 79; C-Iq 144; CPHB 2 {[ 119).

Production in the Tolkyn Field declined from 2005 — 2007, until there was a jump
in production from 2007 — 2008. This sudden increase in gas production led to an
associated increase in water production (“water cut”), which led to a significant
and sustained reduction in gas production, a situation that continues to date. In
relation to the Borankol field, liquid production declined beginning in 2005 and gas
production declined beginning in 2004. (R-I {J 15.2, 16.1, 46.13).

In April 2008, Claimants received the Miller & Lents reserves report, which
showed that their estimates for production from Borankol had been overstated by
300%. (RPHB 2 {| 61).

On 8 April 2008, Kazakhstan amended its 2005 laws regarding the payment of
export taxes. Pursuant to the 2008 amendments, a USD 109.91/ton duty was
imposed on exported crude oil. The 2008 amendments contained specific
provisions, pursuant to which no export tax would be applied to exported crude oil
that had been extracted under Subsoil Use Contracts containing specific
exemptions from the Crude Oil Export Tax. (C-I { 162).

On 28 April 2008, the MEMR, TNG, KazAzot, and KazTransGas entered into a
first agreement setting out their understanding, entitled “Agreement for the
Implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding of 7 May 2007.” (C-1 { 60).

On 5 May 2008, Mr. Cornegruta of KPM wrote to the MEMR for the re-issue of
KPM’s license for the performance of certain activities. The operation of trunk
pipelines was not mentioned, but the exploitation and storage of gas were.
Respondent states that, objectively, the letter specifically and deliberately
requested a license for the operation of trunk pipelines. (RPHB 2 {{ 162)

On 16 May 2008, the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, the MEMR, KMG,
KazTransGas, KazAzot, and TNG agreed that the parties should enter into tri-
partite agreements to resolve the outstanding issues. (C-I {| 60).

On 26 May 2008, the MEMR wrote to KPM, directing KPM to apply to the
ARNM for other licenses it may need, pursuant to the change of law and ARNM’s
new authority. (C-II { 313, CPHB 2 {| 74; RPHB 1 {[ 204).

On 29 May 2008, the MEMR re-issued KPM and TNG their licenses for various
operations, including “oil, gas, and oil products production”, pursuant to the 2007
Law on Licensing. (C-II { 275; CPHB 2 { 74).

On 13 June 2008, Mr. Cornegruta wrote to ARNM, requesting permission to carry
out activities. The Parties dispute whether this letter was an admission that KPM
operated a trunk pipeline. This is later referred to as the “confession” letter and
was relied on by the Republic as the admission of certain facts. (C-II {{[ 313 — 317,
R-I {ff 9.83; 21.9, 25.11, 27.55 - 27.56; R-II { 633, RPHB | {| 205 — 208).
Respondent explains that the letter was clearly an incomplete application for a
license and that it was only one piece of evidence of much more showing that the
KPM Pipeline was trunk. (RPHB | {{{ 205, 209; RPHB 2 {{ 215). Claimants state
that KPM wrote to ARNM inquiring as to whether it needed to have its license re-
issued by the ARNM in light of the changes in the new Law on Licensing. (CPHB
2474).

KPM’s 13 June 2008 application was rejected in July 2008 because the submitted
package of documents did not meet the requirements of the legislation. The
ARNM suggested that KPM submit the documents in accordance with the
legislation. KPM did not submit any documents after that. (R-I {J 21.9, 25.12;
RPHB 1 {[ 202; RPHB 2 {| 218).

On 3 July 2008, after KPM had notified the Customs Committee of its contractual
exemption from specific export taxes, the Customs Committee notified KPM that
“Contract no. 305 contains no regulations as to the exemption from export tax and,
thus, export tax shall be applicable to the crude oil exported under the foregoing
contract.” Pursuant to this notice from the Customs Committee, KPM was
prohibited from exporting 22,000 tons of crude oil for August 2008 without
payment of the Crude Oil Export Tax. KPM conditionally paid these export taxes
and concurrently commenced a legal action challenging imposition of the tax. (C-0
ql 69 — 70; C-1 19).

In summer 2008, Claimants made an “independent business decision” to explore a
sale of KPM, TNG, and the LPG Plant, excepting the Contract 302 properties (the
so-called Tabyl Block). This was nicknamed “Project Zenith” and Claimants
retained Renaissance Capital to facilitate the sale process. (C-I ff 69, 184, C-II |
397; R-I {| 9.67).

On 14 July 2008, the ARNM responded to Mr. Cornegruta’s letter of 13 June 2008,
and stated that further documentation needed to be submitted. Both Parties accept
that none was ever received. (RPHB | {210 — 211). Claimants state that the
ARNM responded by informing KPM that the type of activities listed in KPM’s
2005 license to not require separate licensing from the ARNM. (CPHB 2 {| 74).

On 18 July 2008, Renaissance Capital sent a “teaser” offer to 129 potential
purchasers, including KMG. (C-I { 69; R-II { 775, RPHB 1| {[ 82).

On 20 July 2008, TNG discovered gas and condensate deposits in the East
Munaibay structure of the Tabyl Block. Productivity testing demonstrated a
commercial flow of 120,000 cm/day and 150,000 cm/day of rich gas in the
Asselian and Artinskian strata, respectively, without any treatment for productivity
enhancement, and 3D seismic interpretation of the structure is commensurate with
a substantial find. (C-0 {J 23, 57; C-1 13).

By letter dated 24 July 2008, TNG informed the Geology and Subsoil Use
Committee of the MEMR that it had discovered an oil and gas field by drilling the
Munaibay No. | well in Contract 302. (C-I {67 CPHB 1 {{ 129; CPHB 2 {[ 151).

Later in the summer of 2008, a tri-partite agreement between TNG, KazAzot, and
KazTransGas containing the formula for the price calculation, the volumes of gas
concerned, and the conditions of supply and export was created (“KazAzot
Tripartite Agreement”). Subsequently, Kazakhstan replaced KazTransGas with its
parent company, KMG. (C-I { 60).

On 11 August 2008, TNG filed an application for the evaluation/appraisal phase
for Munaibay No. 1. (C-I { 67; CPHB 2 {{ 151).

In mid-August 2008, Renaissance Capital distributed the Information
Memorandum to 41 parties that had expressed an interest in the properties and
signed a confidentiality agreement, including KMG. (C-I [ 70; RPHB | {[ 82).

On 29 August 2008, KPMG issued a complete Vendor Due Diligence presentation
for Project Zenith. (C-I { 69).

On 25 September 2008, based on information provided by Claimants and upon
invitation by Claimants, KMG EP tendered an indicative offer of USD 754 million
in Project Zenith. Respondent states that, prior to Claimants’ invitation, KMG EP
was not interested in investing. Claimants state that this was among the lowest of
the bids received, amounting to less than half the highest indicative offer (KNOC’s
offer of USD 1.55 billion), and more than 25% below the average of all eight
indicative offers (USD 1.05 billion). Respondent alleges that Renaissance Capital
“tweaked” the numbers by conditioning access to the data room on higher offers.
(C-I 4g 12, 16, 71; C-IE { 378; R-II {J 356 — 357, 781).

On 26 September 2008, KNOC submitted an indicative bid, based on the
assumption that higher export prices could be achieved as a result of the KazAzot
Tripartite Agreement. (RPHB | {[ 95)

Based on Tristan’s financial statements, on 30 September 2008, the cash on hand
and cash equivalents of the Tristan group (KPM, TNG, and Tristan) were USD 9.7
million, despite the issuance of notes in mid-2006 for USD 300 million and at the
beginning of 2007 for USD 120 million. (RPHB 1 {{ 47)

By | October 2008, Claimants had received 8 non-binding indicative offers in
Project Zenith. (C-I J 12, 71; R-I { 16.9; R-II 1 775).

On 6 October 2008, then-President of Moldova, Vladimir Voronin, wrote a letter to
President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, stating that Mr. Anatolie Stati was using
proceeds from Kazakhstan’s mineral resources to invest in areas subject to UN
sanctions, in particular, in South Sudan. At the time, Claimants did not view the
letter as particularly problematic, since Anatolie Stati had frequently sparred with
President Voronin over Moldova’s democratic transformation. Claimants state that
letter contained false and defamatory personal accusations against Anatolie Stati.
Claimants state that Anatolie Stati is not funding terrorist groups in South Sudan.
Claimants admit that Anatolie Stati has normal, commercial investments in the oil
and gas industry in South Sudan and has contributed enormously to the well-being
of the population of South Sudan by making substantial investments in oil and gas
exploration and by building schools, a hospital, medical clinics, and means of
transportation in the region where his investments are located. Claimants maintain
that Anatolie Stati’s investments in South Sudan have never been a secret and have
never violated UN sanctions. Respondent states that there is no evidence that
Stati’s investments contribute to the well-being of the population of South Sudan.
Respondent states that Claimants’ insinuation that President Nazarbayev asked
President Voronin to write the letter is ludicrous. (C-0 J 25; C-I J 74; C-II J 194,
211; R-I 4{f 9.56, 19.21; R-II q[ 43 — 44; RPHB 1 {if 188, 374 — 376; RPHB 2 {[
156).

On 7 October 2008, the MEMR acknowledged TNG’s August 2008 application for
evaluation of the discovery on the Contract 302 property. (C-I {{[ 13, 67).

On 10 October 2008, Claimants withdrew their statement of intention filed on 11
August 2008 because they felt it was still too early in the exploration stage to
commence evaluation. (C-0 57). In its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants explained
that TNG informed Kazakhstan that it was withdrawing its August 2008
application to move to the appraisal phase for Munaibay because it intended to
fully and thoroughly explore the contractual territory because the Munaibay | well
suggested “a high probability of additional discovery of more deep-lying raw
hydrocarbon reservoirs on Munaibay area.” (CPHB 1 {fj 129, 234; CPHB 2 4
151).

On 14 October 2008, Claimants applied to MEMR to extend the exploration period
in the Tabyl Block by two years. (C-II { 175, CPHB 1| J 129, CPHB 2 { 151; R-I'{
31.68; R-II] 416). In October 2008, Claimants commenced an exploratory well in
the Tabyl Block’s Bahyt structure, which had shown evidence of gas in the lower
Triassic stratus. Through October 2008, Claimants had invested USD 43 million in
exploration work in the Contract 302 properties. (C-0 {| 57, C-I {{] 66 — 68).

As of 14 October 2008, the yield to maturity of the Tristan notes stood at 26.319%,
meaning that the Tristan note course stood at USD 65.125 for a nominal value of
USD 100. (RPHB 1 {{ 48, 77)

On 14/16 October 2008, President Nazarbayev issued a document (Exhibit C-8),
which contains both the dates of 14 and 16 October 2008 in the Russian original
and in the English translation. (The Tribunal decided not to address these two
different dates as the difference has no impact on the present dispute. Both dates
are used in the Parties’ submissions and in various parts of this Award.) In the
document, the President instructed Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister, Umirzak
Shukeyev, and the head of the Financial Police, Sarybai Kalmurzayev, to
“thoroughly investigate” / “thoroughly check[{]” all of Claimants’ business
activities in Kazakhstan. (C-0 { 25; C-I J 75; C-II { 16 CPHB 2 {ff 38, 61, 115,
117, 128; RPHB 1 {J 188, 377; RPHB 2 { 10). Respondent disputes the translation
of this order, and states that Claimants’ ability to obtain this internal government
document, points to serious corruption on behalf of Claimants. (R-I {{{ 19.22 —
19.23; R-II { 214). Respondent nonetheless explains that the note is nothing more
than a pro-forma document by which a complaint from one head of state is
forwarded to the competent authorities, as is the etiquette of dealings between CIS
leaders. As explained at the hearing, the letter received no special treatment from
the Financial Police by virtue of the fact that it came from the President.
Respondent stated that the fact that President Nazarbayev does not have any
specific interest in Claimants’ operations in Kazakhstan was confirmed by Minister
Mynbayev during cross-examination. (RPHB | {{{ 377 — 383; RPHB 2 {f] 42 — 44).

On 16 October 2008, the Deputy Prime Minister issued order No. 6497, pursuant to
which the Financial Police, under the supervision of that office, ordered the MEMR.
and the Tax and Customs Committees to conduct comprehensive or complex audits
of KPM and TNG, which commenced on 28 October, 10 November, and 18
November 2008, respectively. Claimants report that the (1) MEMR, (2) Tax
Committee, (3) Customs Committee, (4) National Bank of Kazakhstan, (5)
Geology Committee, (6) Ecology Committee, and (7) MES were ordered to
conduct audits and investigations of KPM and TNG. (C-0 {[ 25, C-I 76; CPHB 2
{il 38, 128). Respondent states that Claimants have exaggerated the nature of the
audits and that there has been no evidence that audits by the Customs Committee,
the Ecology Committee, or the MES occurred. (R-I {[f[ 20.3 — 20.6).

On 18 October 2008, the Financial Police instructed the Customs Committee to
audit KPM’s and TNG’s compliance with export tax laws. (C-I {{ 161 — 163,
CPHB 2 fn. 209).

On 18 October 2008, the Financial Police wrote to the Customs Committee
regarding Anatolie Stati’s travel through Kazakhstan. (CPHB 2 {[ 38, C-11).

On 19 or 20 October 2008, after deciding not to proceed to the firm bidding phase
of Project Zenith, Mr. A. Stati learned of President Nazarbayev’s 14 October 2008
Order. (Stati 2" p. 4).

On 20 October 2008, the Financial Police wrote to the MEMR and an official in
Moldova requesting information on Anatolie Stati, KPM, and TNG. (CPHB 2 {|

On 24 October 2008, the Chief Inspector of the Financial Police, Mr. Turganbayev,
reported that “with respect to the companies controlled by A. Stati,[...] inspections
regarding the completeness of payment of taxes, compliance with labor legislation,
environmental protection legislation, as well as legislation in the sphere of subsoil
use and industrial safety have been [initiated].” He requested that the Deputy
Head of the Department for Investigations of the Financial Police extend the
inspection term two months to 16 December 2008. (C-430; C-II { 213; CPHB 2 {I
38, 128).

On 24 October 2008, the Financial Police ordered comprehensive tax inspections
of KPM and TNG. (CPHB 2 {J 38, 128).

On 24 October the MEMR responded to the Financial Police request for KPM’s
and TNG’s corporate documents showing their shareholdings. (CPHB 2 § 117).

By letter of 27 October 2008, Gazprom refused to accept KazTransGaz as the
exporter. (RPHB 2 { 499).

On 28 October 2008, the Financial Police ordered the Geology Committee, the
Ecology Committee, the National Bank of Kazakhstan, the Tax Committee, and the
MES to carry out inspections of KPM and TNG and insisted that Financial Police
be permitted to participate. (C-0 | 36, CPHB 2 {{{[ 38, 61, 128).

On 30 October 2008, the Financial Police issued a finding that Anatolie Stati is not
a registered businessman in Kazakhstan, but that he carries out his business
through Ascom. They found that “ASCOM SA owns 100% of the participation
share in KPM.” (C-II { 86; CPHB 2 { 38).

On 30 October 2008, the Financial Police reported on KPM’s and TNG’s activities
and noted specific items to inspect, but found that KPM and TNG were compliant
with their investment obligations. (CPHB 2 {{ 38).

In the fall of 2008, TNG’s largest non-local customer, Kemikal, failed to post bank
guarantees that were part of its required payment terms. Claimants state that,
because Kemikal had an erratic payment history, TNG chose not to renew that
contract without the bank guarantees in place (and in fact, ended up pursuing
Kemikal until June of 2009 to acquire the last of Kemikal’s overdue payments).
TNG approached KazRosGas about purchasing its excess gas for export, but
KazRosGas never responded. (C-II {{ 382, partially quoted; R-II {{] 751 - 752).
Respondent notes that Kemikal is a commercial entity that cannot be attributed to
the state. Likewise, KazRosGas is a joint venture under equal participation of
Gazprom and KMG and the Republic is not responsible for its actions. Kemikal
stopped payments toward the end of 2008 because of “liquidity and insolvency”
issues, per the PwC Due Diligence Report. (R-II {{] 757 — 758; RPHB 2 {fj 21 —
23, 61, 124).

In November 2008, Renaissance Capital asked KNOC to revise their bid. (RPHB |

By 1 November 2008, Financial Police informed the Deputy Prime Minister of
Kazakhstan that it had discovered that Anatolie Stati left Kazakhstan in 2007. (C-IL
212).

On | November 2008, Financial Police reported to Deputy Prime Minister,
confirming the ownership of KPM and TNG and informing him that inspections
were being carried out. (CPHB 2 {| 38).

On 4 November 2008, the Committee of Geology and Subsoil Resources Use of
the MEMR commenced an audit of KPM and TNG regarding compliance on
legislation on industrial safety. This inspection was organized and attended by the
Financial Police and was scheduled to last until 15 November 2008. (C-I { 89;
CPHB 2 {{{[ 38, 61; RPHB 2 {{ 157).

On 7 November 2008, the Tax Committee initiated a targeted audit of KPM and
TNG at the request of the Financial Police regarding transfer pricing (“Transfer
Price Audit”). (C-I{ 172; CPHB 2 {{{[ 38, 128). Respondent does not admit that the
audit was instructed by the Financial Police. (R-I {[ 30.62).

On 7 November 2008, Anatolie Stati wrote to President Nazarbayev, assuring him
that there were no reasons to investigate KPM and TNG. (CPHB 2 {[f[ 38, 142).

On 7 November 2008, the Financial Police ordered the Customs Committee to
inspect KPM and TNG for compliance with payment of export duties. (CPHB 2 {{]
38, 128).

The comprehensive tax audits of KPM and TNG began on 10 November 2008.
The audits covered the period from 1 January 2005 through 31 December 2007 for
KPM, and 1 January 2003 through 31 December 2007 for TNG. The audits
pertained to corporate income tax, royalties, individual income tax, social tax,
property tax, land tax, tax on vehicles, excise taxes, corporate income tax on non-
resident legal entities, and payment for use of natural and other resources. (C-0 {|
60; C-I{ 156; CPHB 2 {J 38, 128).

On 11 November 2008, the MEMR’s Geology Committee concluded its audit (4
days ahead of schedule) and found that KPM and TNG were in compliance with
their obligations. (C-I { 89; CPHB 2 {[{ 38, 61). Respondent reports that an
inspection was carried out to assess whether KPM and TNG were acting in
compliance with their licenses. Reports were written after the inspection and were
signed by Mr. Cornegruta (KPM) and Mr. Cojin (TNG). (RPHB | {{ 192). The
Financial Police attended this meeting, but the ARNM did not. (R-I { 26.8; R-II {|
455). The Financial Police found that KPM did not have a trunk pipeline license.
(C-II qf 16, 380).

On 12 November 2008, following the site visit, the Financial Police asked ARNM
whether KPM, TNG, and another Stati company called “Kok Mai” held a license
for a trunk pipeline. (CPHB 1 {[ 155; CPHB 2 { 61; R-I { 26.9; R-II I] 464 — 465;
RPHB 1 {{{[ 198 — 202).

On 12 November 2008, the Financial Police ordered the Customs Committee to
inspect KPM’s and TNG’s import/export volumes. (CPHB 2 38).

On 13 November 2008, the Tax Committee noted that including the Financial
Police in inspections would be illegal and proposed that a working group be
established instead to review inspection results. (CPHB 2 {{{[ 38, 128).

On 14 November 2008, the MEMR reported to the Financial Police on KPM’s and
TNG’s export volumes. (CPHB 2 § 38).

On 14 November 2008, the ARNM replied to a request for clarification by Mr.
Turganbayev that KPM and TNG had each applied for — but neither held - licenses
to operate main pipelines, and that operation of a trunk pipeline requires such a
license. (C-I {| 90, CPHB 2 { 61; R-I 26.10; R-II { 466; RPHB 2 {[ 164).

Claimants allege that, on 14 November 2008, Financial Police insisted that Mr.
Cojin and Mr. Cornegruta sign inspection reports “admitting” that KPM and TNG
do not hold licenses to operate “main” pipelines. (CPHB 2 § 61). Respondent
contests this allegation and states that it is only supported by the incredible
testimony of Mr. Cojin. (RPHB 2 {If 158 — 160).

On 17 November 2008, the Financial Police determined that the pipelines were
trunk pipelines, and then discovered that KPM and TNG did not have the necessary
licenses. (R-I {| 38.22; RPHB 2 {{| 165 — 172). Claimants refer to this as the
“reclassification” and Respondent calls it a “discovery.” (C-II { 249; R-I {{f[ 22.6,
23.19, 38.22; R-II ff 451, 542).

On 17 November 2008, the Financial Police ordered a new audit of KPM and TNG
to determine the income from its trunk pipeline operations, as well as KPM’s entire
revenue for onward sales of oil. (C-0 { 42; C-I { 92; CPHB 2 {{f 38, 61, 81; R-II {
469; RPHB 2 {J 172 — 173). .

A 17 November 2008 agreement memorialized the TNG, KazAzot, and
KazTransGas (later replaced with its parent company KMG) tri-partite terms on
price, volumes, and conditions. TNG and KMG signed the agreement and it was
hand-delivered to KazAzot for signature, but KazAzot never signed the agreement.
(C-I] 60; CPHB 1 { 130).

On 18 November 2008, the Financial Police issued a resolution for the inspection
of unpaid customs taxes by TNG. (CPHB 2 {ff 38, 128).

On 18 November 2008, the ARNM replied that TNG and KPM did not hold
licenses for trunk pipelines and that Kok Mai had never been asked about such
licenses, previously. (RPHB | {[ 198).

KPM and TNG first made contact with the MES, the state authority responsible for
the supervision and control of industrial safety of in-field and main pipelines, on 19
November 2008. (R-I {| 28.10).

On 19 November 2008, the Tax Committee, at the request of the Financial Police,
determined that the amount of “illegal profit” from operation of the trunk pipeline
was 41.8 billion Tenge (USD 348 million as of November 2008) for KPM, and
37.7 billion Tenge (USD 314 million as of November 2008) for TNG. (C-0 {{ 42;

KPM’s and TNG’s oil and gas production revenues from the Borankol and Tolkyn
fields for the audited period 2005-2007. (C-0 {| 42). Claimants provide the
Tribunal with a detailed explanation as to how the Tax Committee erred in its
calculation at C-II {{[ 330 — 331, which Respondent contests at R-II {{ 620.
Respondent states that these calculations were based on TNG’s own tax filings and
were based on the underlying materials of KPM. (R-I { 26.19).

On 19 November 2008, the Specialized Interdistrict Court of Mangystau Region
delivered a judgment in KPM’s favor in response to KPM’s challenge of export
duties. The Court ruled that the imposition on KPM of the Crude Oil Export Tax
was illegal. (R-I 30.56; R-II { 743; C-I{ 164).

On 19 November 2008, KPM and TNG obtained written confirmation from the
MES that “all pipelines operated by your enterprise, from the place of extraction
to the point of transferring the hydrocarbons to the oil and gas main pipelines
are not main pipelines. We would also like to communicate that the extraction of
oil (crude oil, gas condensate, and natural gas) to the surface, treatment and
transportation of oil to the place of transfer into a main pipeline and (or) another
means of transport form a single technological process of oil production.” (C-I1
283, partially quoted, emphasis maintained; CPHB | {{ 172; CPHB 2 {{{[ 38, 61, 98).

Respondent clarifies that the 19 November 2008 letter from the MES states that
only some of Claimants’ pipelines are not trunk pipelines. In any event, the letters
were beyond the competence of the MES. (R-I {[f[ 28.11 - 28.13).

On 20 November 2008, the Financial Police commenced an investigation
concerning KPM’s contractual export tax exemption. (C-0 72). They ordered an
economics expert from the Ministry of Justice to confirm Tax Committee
calculations and instructed that the calculation include transport fees received from
TNG’s and KPM’s revenues from sales of oil. (CPHB 2 § 81).

On 21 November 2008, Financial Police ordered the MES to withdraw its
statements confirming that KPM’s and TNG’s pipelines are not “main” on the basis
that the MES is not competent to provide that conclusion. (CPHB 2 fff 38, 61, 98;
R-I{ 26.12).

On 25 November 2008, Financial Police wrote to Ministry of Finance inquiring
into why the Customs Committee “exonerated” KPM from oil export duties, given
that KPM had provisionally paid the disputed duties. (CPHB 2 {{{[ 38, 128).

In late November 2008, KazAzot requested that KMG perform another audit of the
ammonia-carbamide complex project, especially regarding the delivery prices of
gas, which KazAzot allegedly wanted reconsidered. KazAzot indicated that it
would sign the 17 November 2008 agreement within six months, subject to the
audit. (C-I] 61).

On 28 November 2008, the Ministry of Justice economics expert confirmed the
Tax Committee’s calculation and concluded that KPM’s illegal profits exceeded 41
billion Tenge. (CPHB 281).

By a correspondence stamped with the date 28 November 2011, the National Bank
acknowledged letters from the Financial Police dated 28 October and 31 October
2008 by which the National Bank was directed to conduct exceptional inspections
and to include members of the Financial Police in the control team. The National
Bank stated that although it could not comply with the request to include the
financial police employees among the auditors, it would issue conclusions
regarding the compliance by the companies with current legislation. The letter
informed that an extraordinary inspection of KPM had occurred, while
extraordinary inspections of TNG and Kok Mai had not occurred. (C-15).

On 2 December 2008, Financial Police sent an internal report confirming that KPM
operated a “main” pipeline without a license and had gained illegal income of over
41 billion Tenge. (CPHB 2 {{{f[ 38, 61).

Claimants attempted to obtain a bridge loan to provide additional working capital
in connection with their decision to put the companies on the market. On 5
December 2008, Credit Suisse sent Claimants a term sheet for a USD 150-175
million facility. (C-II { 381).

On 10 December 2008, Mr. Turganbayev (Financial Police) reported to the Prime
Minister that KPM and TNG were operating trunk oil and gas pipelines, but further
inquiries were necessary since the Financial Police are not competent to classify
pipelines. (C-II { 220, CPHB 2 {{{[ 38, 61; R-II { 473).

The Transfer Price Audit was suspended on 12 December 2008. (R-II { 407).

On 15 December 2008, the Financial Police opened a criminal investigation against
KPM based on suspicions that KPM was operating a truck pipeline without a
license, due to the following findings: (1) on 13 June 2008, KPM applied to the
ARNM for re-issuance of a license, indicating that it believed it was operating a
trunk pipeline, (2) on 14 July 2008 ARNM informed KPM that it needed to submit
documents for the license to operate a trunk pipeline, (3) a 4 December 2008
MEMR report confirming that neither KPM nor TNG had been issued licenses for
the operation of trunk pipelines, (4) confirmation that KPM had been operating the
pipeline at least since 2005, (5) an expert report stating that TNG’s pipeline was a
trunk pipeline, and that this one was similar to KPM’s, and (6) a 28 November
2008 report stating that KPM’s income from operating the pipeline without a
license amounted to 41,166,014,544 Tenge. (R-II [| 294; 475; RPHB | { 222,
RPHB 2 {{[ 177 — 179; CPHB 1 {{{[ 168, 346; CPHB 2 {{[ 38, 61). Respondent
concedes that the investigation phase started in December 2008 without a
conclusive finding that the pipeline was trunk. (RPHB 2 {{ 178).

On 18 December 2008, the yield to maturity on the Tristan notes increased from
26.319% to 45.666%. (RPHB | {{[ 77, 78).

On 18 December 2008, notified TNG of irregularities in the 2003 Gheso transfer
and the corresponding potential violation of the State’s pre-emptive right. The
MEMR informed TNG that it was “cancelling” the State’s explicit ruling of 20
February 2007 that allowed the 2003 transfer of TNG from Gheso to Terra Raf.
The MEMR demanded that TNG submit a new application for the transfer. The
notice required TNG to submit all documentation regarding Terra Raf’s ownership

terminating TNG’s Subsoil Use Contracts for the Tabyl Block and the Tolkyn

On 18 December 2008, INTERFAX issued a report accusing Claimants of having
altered documents in order to defraud the State of its pre-emptive right to purchase
the companies. The Parties dispute whether the Tribunal should view this as a
MEMR press release (Claimants) or whether this was an independent press item
that cannot be attributed to Respondent (Respondent). Respondent states that
INTERFAX received the information from unofficial sources. (C-II {{{ 400, 402;
CPHB | {fff 137, 215, 347 — 348, 350; CPHB 2 {If 38; 117; R-II {f 171, 747 — 749,

On 18 December 2008, Credit Suisse sent Mr. Lungu of Ascom the INTERFAX
press release and requested an explanation. After discussions, Credit Suisse
informed Claimants that it would not provide the bridge loan until Claimants
resolved their disputes with the Kazakhstan government. (C-II { 381; CPHB 2 {I
117, 210 — 211). Respondent states that Claimants have not provided any proof that
the news agency piece caused Credit Suisse to step back from providing the bridge
loan. (R-II {{ 747 — 749; RPHB 2 {{{[ 95 — 99).

On 20 December 2008, the Financial Police began interrogation of KPM and TNG
employees. (CPHB 2 {[ 38).

On 22 December 2008, TNG refused to submit the required application before the
MEMR and lodged objections to the State’s reversal of its consent to the 2003
transfer. (C-I { 146; CPHB 2 {[ 117).

On 23 December 2008, the Board of Appeal of the Mangystau Regional Court
accepted an appeal by the Aktau territorial customs body of the 19 November 2008
court ruling in favour of KPM. Subsequent appeals of the Mangystau Regional
Court’s decision were dismissed. (C-0 J 72; C-1{ 165, CPHB 2 { 128).

Claimants received a letter dated 24 December 2008 from the Financial Police, but
disagree as to the legal content of the letter. The letter requested information
regarding (a) the level of protection of the company, and (b) sales made by KPM to
agents, individuals, and other businesses. (R-I {| 26.20; CPHB 2 {[ 38). Claimants
state the letter notified KPM that it was the subject of a criminal investigation for
operating a main pipeline without a license. (C-0 { 43; C-I {| 94). Respondent
reports that this was not a notice of criminal investigation. (R-I { 26.20).

On 30 December 2008, the Financial Police conducted an on-site investigation at
the Borankol and Tolkyn Fields. (C-I {| 95; CPHB 2 {[ 38). Respondent says that
the purpose of the inspection was to specify the process of production, refining,
and further transportation of hydrocarbon material, and to make sure that the
pipelines matched the documents describing their construction, placement, and
other physical features. (R-II { 481).

Oil and gas prices were severely depressed in December 2008 and January 2009.

On 27 January 2009, the Transport Prosecutor forwarded KPM’s and TNG’s
complaints to the prosecutor for the Western Region. (CPHB 2 {{ 142).

On 29 January 2009, KPM and TNG sent complaints to the Financial Police
regarding seizure orders and requested a copy of the order that was serving as the
basis for the criminal investigation. (CPHB 2 {[ 142).

On 30 January 2009, the Deputy Transport Prosecutor for the Western Region
informed KPM and TNG that the complaints are under investigation pending
responses from the Financial Police. (CPHB 2 {| 142).

On 2 February 2009, the Financial Police notified Claimants that their complaints
were rejected and that TNG was the subject of a criminal investigation on the same
basis, which led to criminal charges against the in-country manager of TNG from
2002 to 2009. The charges were later suspended. The Financial Police rejected the
request to provide the order on the ground that no person was the subject of the
investigation. (C-0 {| 43, 54; C-I {[ 96; CPHB 2 {fff 38, 61, 142). Respondent
accuses Claimants of submitting a misleading translation of C-98. (RPHB | {|
1065).

On 4 February 2009, KPM and TNG wrote to the ARNM and asked to be included
in the analysis for the classification of the pipelines. (CPHB 2 {[ 142).

On 4 February 2009, the GPO forwarded complaints from KPM and TNG to the
Transport Prosecutor of the Mangystau Region. (CPHB 2 {[ 142).

On 4 February 2009, Financial Police interviewed Mr. Cojin (General Manager of
TNG) to determine whether he or Mr. Cornegruta would be the appropriate
defendant in any criminal proceedings. (R-II {[ 480).

On 4 February 2009, the MEMR wrote to the Financial Police that the KPM
pipeline “belongs to pipelines working as a gathering manifold and is not a main
pipeline.” (CPHB 1 § 171; CPHB 2 4 38, 61, 98). Respondent states that this
MEMR letter was withdrawn on the MEMR’s own accord on the basis that it had
not been reviewed by the legal department. (RPHB | {| 229 — 230; RPHB 2 {[
183). The 4 February 2009 letter is an internal government document which was
not included in Mr. Cornegruta’s criminal file. In this regard, Respondent
reiterated its concerns about Claimants’ access to internal documents. (RPHB 2 {
186).

On 5 February 2009, KPM and TNG wrote to the MEMR asking to be included in
the analysis regarding the classification of the pipelines. (CPHB 2 {{ 142).

On 5 February 2009, the Transport Prosecutor of Mangystau Region forwarded
complaints of KPM and TNG to First Deputy Transport Prosecutor of the Western
Region. (CPHB 2 {[ 142).

On 9 February 2009, the Financial Police ordered the College of Experts of the
MOJ to produce an expert report to classify the KPM pipeline. (C-I { 104; C-II {|
249; CPHB | {| 181; CPHB 2 {fj 38, 61). Respondent states that the cover letter to
the 9 February 2009 Order explained that the Financial Police were under time

pressure and required determination of the issue. Mr. Baymaganbetov stated that
these resolutions were received frequently by the department in respect of
investigations of companies. (R-II {| 553).

On 10 February 2009, Mr. Baymaganbetov met Mr. Turganbayev, who had
previously been in charge of the inspection and of procuring a preliminary report
on the classification of pipelines. (R-II {{ 554). The two men set out the four
documents that had been given to Mr. Baymaganbetov. (CPHB 2 {ff 38, 61; RPHB
24 195). Mr. Baymaganbetov was entitled to seek out as much further information
as he needed. Respondent states that the four other so-called “expert” opinions
procured by Claimants were not shown to Mr. Baymaganbetov because they could
have unfairly tainted his opinion. (RPHB 2 {| 195 — 196).

The comprehensive tax audits of KPM and TNG lasted until 10 February 2009. (C-
061). On that date, the State sent notices/Acts of Inspection to KPM and TNG
that the Article 23 amortization rate, and not the Article 20 rate, was applicable to
the companies’ well drilling costs for the years 2005 to 2007 and assessed
approximately USD 62 million in back taxes and penalties against the companies.
(C-0 J 61 and 53 partially quoted, cites 69 million; C-I {jf 19, 159; C-II {J 16,223,
380; CPHB | {{{[ 139, 243; CPHB 2 {{{[ 38, 128).

On 11 February 2009, the letter prepared on 4 February was replaced by a letter
dated 11 February, in which the MEMR wrote to KPM and TNG stating that it was
not competent to resolve their complaints. (RPHB | {[ 229).

On 13 February 2009, MEMR wrote to KPM and TNG stating that it is not
competent to resolve their complaints regarding the criminal prosecution and
suggested that they write to the GPO. (CPHB 2 {{ 142).

On 13 February 2009, the MEMR wrote to the Financial Police and provided them
information on how the definition of “trunk pipeline” in Art. 1 of the Law on Oil
should be interpreted. The MEMR noted that an expert would need to be
appointed to determine the status of the pipelines. (RPHB 2 { 183).

On 13 February 2009, Mr. Baymaganbetov issued the expert decision that KPM’s
pipelines were trunk pipelines. He based this decision only on the documents
received from Mr. Turganbayev. Respondent states that Mr. Baymaganbetov came
to his decision quickly because the matter at hand was not unduly complex and he
had time to devote to the issue, which fitted with the Financial Police’s need for a
prompt opinion. In any event, Mr. Baymaganbetov required at least three times as
long to issue his opinion than did Claimants’ purported expert, Mr. Idrisov. (R-II
Ql 554 — 555; CPHB 2 {J 38, 61, 98; RPHB 2 {{f[ 188, 193).

On 16 February 2009, TNG provided the 12 May 2003 SPA between Gheso and
Terra Raf to the MEMR. (CPHB 2 { 117).

On 18 February 2009, Moody’s downgraded the Tristan debt due to the “amplified
regulatory and operational risk” posed by the unresolved criminal investigation of
KPM and the pre-emptive right claim concerning TNG. (CPHB 2 {J 38, 117).

In mid-February 2009, Turkish Petroleum Corporation and PSA Energy Holding
SPC were granted access to the Project Zenith data room containing over 2,000
reports, agreements, surveys, maps, and other documents relating to KPM’s and
TNG’s geological data, operations, and financial, tax, and legal matters. The
geological data contained in the data room included 3D seismic data, interpreted
seismic horizons, faults (cuts and boundaries), and well tops and coordinates.
These companies later withdrew from the bid process. (C-I {| 186; R-II {| 763).

On 24 February 2009, Financial Police seized KPM’s corporate documents.
(CPHB 2 {[ 38).

On 24 February 2009, TNG complained to MEMR regarding the negative effects
of the December 2008 publication on its business and reputation. (CPHB 2 { 117).

On 27 February 2009, the State responded to TNG’s objections to the 18 December
2008 notice, stating that the transfer of TNG to Terra Raf had breached the State’s
statutory pre-emptive right to acquire TNG. The State demanded that TNG submit
a new application for the consent to the transfer and waiver of the State’s pre-
emptive purchase right and that failure to do so would result in termination of
TNG’s Subsoil Use Contracts. (C-0 {| 28, partially quoted; C-I {| 148; CPHB 2 {{{[
38, 117). This was the last action from the MEMR with regard to the pre-emptive
rights claim. (CPHB 2 {{ 117).

On 27 February 2009 and 2 March 2009, respectively, KPM and TNG filed
separate complaints before the Tax Committee requesting cancellation of the 10
February 2009 notices. The Tax Committee refused to consider the complaints and
Claimants spent the next 1.5 years litigating the matter before Kazakh courts. (C-0
{ 63; C-I J 159; CPHB 2 {ff 128, 142).

Claimants report that, in February 2009, Claimants made a management
presentation for TOTAL. After examining the data room and the management
presentation, TOTAL stated that they were going to speak with the Kazakh
authorities about the properties before they would be willing to move ahead with a
binding proposal. Claimants state that TOTAL spoke with the Kazakh authorities
in late February or early March 2009, and withdrew from the bid process, allegedly
for technical reasons relating to the properties, but likely because Kazakh
authorities discouraged them. (C-I {[ 187). Respondent states that Claimants have
not provided substantiation of their claim that Kazakh authorities spoke to TOTAL.
(R-II 799).

On 3 March 2009, NIPI Neftegaz and the Kazakh Research and Design Institute of
KMG confirmed to TNG that drilling wells amounts to construction and, thus,
drilling expense can be deducted 100% in the year incurred as expenses for own-
account construction. (CPHB 2 { 128).

On 3 and 4 March, 2009, Financial Police seized KPM’s and TNG’s corporate
documents. (CPHB 2 {[ 38).

On 5 March 2009, Moody’s downgraded the Tristan debt again, based on the
worsening treatment of KPM and TNG by Kazakhstan and, in particular, the
opening of a formal criminal investigation against TNG. (CPHB 2 { 38).

On 9 March 2009, Claimants re-filed their notice of discovery in the East
Munaibay structure and filed a notice of discovery in the Bahyt structure with the
MEMR. Claimants also re-notified the MEMR of their intention to exercise their
contractual right to extend the exploration period in the Tabyl Block by two years.
(C-0 58, partially quoted; C-I [ 176). Because there had been no response to the
extension request, Claimants declared their intention to appraise those discoveries.
(CPHB 2 {[ 151).

On 11 March 2009, the MEMR confirmed to KPM that the drilling of wells
amounts to construction and that, thus, drilling expenses can be deduced 100% in
the year incurred as expenses for own-account construction. (CPHB 2 {{ 128).

On 18 March 2009, TNG responded to the State’s 27 February 2009 notice of
breach and offered the State three alternatives: (1) revocation of the notice that
purported to “reverse” the State’s February 2007 decision; (2) TNG’s reapplication
for a transfer permit, if the State would agree to pay USD 1.347 billion in
compensation if the permit was denied, or (3) referral of the dispute to the
Arbitration Institute of the SCC and maintenance of TNG’s status quo rights under
the TNG Subsoil Use Contracts, pending a final arbitral decision. (C-0 {{ 29; C-I {{f
38, 149; CPHB 2 { 117). Respondent cites this letter as an attempt to provoke the
Republic. (R-I J 9.76).

On 18 March 2009, KPM and TNG filed a complaint against initiation of criminal
cases undertaken by the Financial Police, with the GPO. (C-I {I 96, 332; CPHB 2
Ql 38, 142).

On 19 March 2009, a meeting chaired by the MEMR Executive Secretary,
Mr. A. B. Batalov, and attended by representatives of Terra Raf, TNG, Ascom, and
KPM was held at the MEMR offices. All of the State’s actions against Claimants
since President Nazarbayev’s 14 October 2008 investigative directive were
discussed. Claimants state that Mr. Batalov assured Claimants that all of these
issues would be disposed of in favour of TNG and KPM, and that TNG’s Subsoil
Use Contracts would not be cancelled, if TNG simply submitted a new application
for its transfer to Terra Raf and permitted the State to re-evaluate its prior consent.
Mr. Batalov also stated that, because the size and value of TNG had changed since
the 2003 transfer to Terra Raf, the State would require a new and contemporary
evaluation of TNG’s books and assets (as of February 2007) in order to properly
re-evaluate the transfer. KMG would conduct this new evaluation. Claimants state
that the MEMR assured them that the pre-emptive right claim would be resolved in
their favour. (C-0 {{] 30 — 31, 82; CPHB 2 {{{[ 38, 117, 151). Claimants also report
that Mr. Batalov and his deputy indicated that the reclassification of sections of
TNG’s and KPM’s in-field pipelines as trunk pipelines was, in the MEMR’s view,
due to a defect in the applicable legislation. Finally, Claimants state that the
MEMR also indicated that the Financial Police ought to rely on opinions of
experts. Minutes of the meeting were prepared by Mr. Grigore Pisica and were
offered to Mr. Batalov for his signature, but he refused to sign. (C-I {{{ 106, 150,
152, 177). Respondent agrees with the above, but states that “it is simply not the
case” that Mr. Batalov assured the Claimants that all outstanding issues in relation
to TNG and KPM would be resolved in Claimants’ favour, or that there was any
“reclassification” of pipelines. (R-I ff 13.47(e)(v), 21.1).

On 24 March 2009, TNG applied for permit for the transfer of TNG’s ownership to
Terra Raf and for a written decision on the State’s waiver of its pre-emptive rights.
(C-0 { 32, partially quoted; C-I {{f[ 153, 332).

On 24 March 2009, TNG applied to MEMR for the inclusion of the issue of the
extension of the exploration period of Contract 302 for 2 years into the agenda of
the next meeting of the Expert Commission. (R-I {[ 31.69).

On 24 March 2009, KPM and TNG sent a complaint to President Nazarbayev.
(CPHB 2 {{ 142).

On 25 March 2009, TNG sent the State a request for a written decision regarding
the right of TNG to transfer Terra Raf’s ownership interests to a prospective third
party buyer, including KMG, based upon a competitive bidding process and direct
negotiations. No response was ever received. (C-0 {{ 32, partially quoted; C-I {{{[
153, 154, 332).

On 27 March 2009, Financial Police order KPM and TNG to submit originals of
their corporate documents. (CPHB 2 {[ 38).

On 30 March 2009, KPM responded to the Financial Police’s request for
documents and requested copies of the criminal investigation order. The Financial
Police ordered TNG to submit additional original company documents. (CPHB 2 {[
38).

On 30 March 2009, the Transport Prosecutor for the Western Region wrote to
KPM and TNG stating that complaints were under investigation and noted that it
had received nothing from the Financial Police in response to inquiries. (CPHB 2 {[
142).

On 30 March 2009, Contract 302 expired. (R-II { 411).

In April 2009, KMG received access to the complete Project Zenith data room. (C-
17 191; C-II { 383).

Claimants removed CASCo, a Stati-owned service company that was doing the
service work in the fields, from the field in 2009. (C-II {| 409; R-I J 9.70; R-II {
791). Respondent notes that Anatolie Stati’s testimony regarding ownership of
CASCo was inconsistent with and, indeed, was contradicted by other witnesses, his
previous statements, and Claimants’ own due diligence of 29 August 2008. (RPHB
1 49[ 117 — 136).

Respondent reports that, in April 2009, Gabriel Stati was arrested following
elections in Moldova, amid allegations that he was involved in the organization and
financing of civil unrest and attempting to overthrow the Moldovan government.
Moldovan authorities extradited him from the Ukraine. (R-II { 35).

On 2 April 2009, the Expert Commission passed the Decision, recommending the
extension of Contract 302 for 2 years. (R-I {| 31.70; CPHB | {{ 236, CPHB 2 {[

On 6 April 2009, Financial Police requested information on TNG’s costs for oil
and condensate in relation to the criminal case against KPM. (CPHB 2 {[ 38).

On 9 April 2009, the MEMR issued a written statement to execute the extension of
Contract 302 to 30 March 2011, which Claimants state that they requested on 9
March 2009, and which Respondent states was requested on 24 March 2009.
Claimants state that MEMR notified TNG of its agreement to extend Contract 302
and undertook to execute the amendment by 2 July 2009. (C-0 {[ 58; C-I {fj 22,
178; C-II { 241, CPHB 1 { 224, CPHB 2 {| 151; R-I [ 31.71). Respondent states
that the adopted decision has the character of a recommendation and is only one of
many legal actions required for a valid contract extension. (R-I {{] 31.72 - 31.73;
R-II { 414). Respondent states that the true translation of the decision highlights
that actual prolongation of the contract remains to be undertaken. (R-II {{{ 413,
419 — 424). Since TNG did not apply for a renewal license No. 243-D in
conjunction with the application for the extension, the competent authority had no
right to extend the term of the Contract 302. (R-I { 31.79; R-II {| 436). To add
context, Respondent states that, in 2008, the competent authority received 152
applications for extension of exploration periods. Of these, 31 were refused. In
2009, the competent authority received 139 applications, of which 38 were refused.
(R-I{ 31.81).

On 13 April 2009, five experts from the Russian Science and Research Institute for
the Construction and Operation of Pipelines and Energy Facilities issued expert
opinions affirming that the pipelines in question were not trunk pipelines. (C-I
101; C-II { 289; CPHB 2 {J 61, 98).

On 20 April 2009, Mr Rakhimov decided to detain KMG’s general manager, Mr.
Cornegruta, and opened criminal proceedings against him for the crime of illegal
entrepreneurial activity under Art. 190(2)(b) of the Criminal Code of the Republic.
At that time, Mr. Cornegruta was named as a potential defendant. (R-II { 487;
RPHB 1 {[ 230, RPHB 2 { 189).

On 22 April 2009, the Financial Police ordered additional documents from KPM.
(CPHB 2 {[ 38).

On 25 April 2009, the Financial Police arrested Mr. Cornegruta and took him in for
interrogation. (CPHB 2 {{f[ 38, 61).

On 26 April 2009, Claimants filed complaints against the Financial Police,
including its head investigator, Mr. Rakhimov. The same day, 900 employees of
KPM, TNG, and CASCo that were on shift addressed and signed a letter to the
Governor of the Mangystau Region expressing their concerns. (C-I {| 109).

On 27 April 2009, Mr. Batalov was fired as Executive Secretary of MEMR. (C-I
GM 106, 332).

On 27 April 2009, the court of Aktau considered and rejected a petition against Mr.
Cornegruta’s arrest. (RPHB | § 244).

On 28 April 2009, KazAzot explained that it did not sign the 17 November 2008
Tri-Partite Agreement because, among other things, an audit that it had carried out,

particularly in light of the impact that the global financial crisis had had on the
mineral fertilizers market, had demonstrated the unfeasibility of the project. (R-I{
15.7).

On 30 April 2009, the Financial Police issued attachment orders in respect of
KPM’s and TNG’s Subsoil Use Contracts. (R-I { 29.2). Claimants report that the
Financial Police issued no fewer than 10 orders for the sequestration of property,
which resulted in freezing KPM’s and TNG’s shares, KPM’s Contract 305, TNG’s
Contracts 210 and 302, KPM’s field oil pipeline, TNG’s field gas pipeline, TNG’s
condensate pipeline, and the companies’ other property. Those orders prevented
KPM and TNG from selling or depreciating the value of those assets. (C-I {{ 121;
C-II{ 335; CPHB 1 {| 140; CPHB 2 {ff 38, 61).

On 30 April 2009 and on 4 May 2009, TNG submitted Addendum No. 9 of TNG’s
Tabyl Block Subsoil Use Contract to the MEMR for execution. TNG never
received the MEMR’s signature to the addendum extending TNG’s exploration
rights. (C-0 {| 58; C-I{[ 22, 178; CPHB 2 {{ 151).

On 30 April 2009, the Deputy Minister of the MES wrote to Claimants and asked
them to withdraw his previous letters of 19 November 2008, as their issuance was
beyond his competence. (R-I {{ 28.13).

On | May 2009, the decision to detain Mr. Cornegruta was confirmed on appeal.
(R-II {| 487; RPHB 1 {{ 244).

Claimants and Respondent report that construction of the LPG Plant was halted in
May 2009 due, at least in part, to “cash constraints.” (C-I { 64; R-I 19.24).

On 4 May 2009, Mr. Rakhimov of the Financial Police ordered an unscheduled
inspection to determine the amount of income KPM had obtained by operating a
trunk pipeline without a license. (RPHB 2 {[ 190).

On 6 — 7 May 2009, pursuant to a search warrant dated 30 April 2009, the
Financial Police conducted an overnight search of KPM’s and TNG’s offices for
the other General Managers of KPM, Messrs. Salagor and Spasov, and the General
Manager of TNG, Mr. Cojin, as well as information on their whereabouts. (C-I {|
111, CPHB 2 {[ 38; R-I { 27.47; R-II { 486; RPHB 1 {{ 233). The three in-country
managers had been charged with the same offense as Mr. Cornegruta. The initial
phase of the search started at 4:20 p.m. on May 6 and ended at 4:15 a.m. on May 7,
2007. (C-I{ 111). The search was carried out in the presence of Deputy Director
General for Economic and Financial Affairs of TNG, Mr. Stejar. (R-I {| 27.47).
Respondent states that the Financial Police procured human resources and financial
records from KPM and TNG. (R-II { 483). Respondent states that it became clear
during the course of the investigation that most senior managers had left
Kazakhstan. (R-II { 486). The Parties dispute the level of inconvenience caused
by the search. (C-I { 111; R-II {{[ 301 et seg.). Claimants state that the Financial
Police seized other documents not listed in the warrant and searched Mr.
Cornegruta’s flat. (C-I { 112). Respondent makes no admission as to C-I {{ 112,
but notes that no complaints were made at the time. (R-I { 27.48).

On 7 May 2009, Mr. Anatolie Stati, on behalf of Claimants, wrote to President
Nazarbayev to obtain the release of Mr. Cornegruta, to protect the former and
current management of KPM and TNG, and to end the dispute. (C-I {{f[ 39, 113,
332, C-43; CPHB 2 {ff 38, 142). Anatolie Stati decided to pause construction on the
LPG Plant and to reduce planned development efforts at Tolkyn and Borankol.
(CPHB 2 {{[ 38). Claimants also state that this letter made clear that Claimants
intended to bring arbitration claims against Kazakhstan for the diminution of value
of their investments once the sale to Cliffson closed. (C-II {{ 392). While
Respondent makes no admission as to whether any letter was written or sent to or
received by President Nazarbayev, Respondent confirms the existence of the
letters. (R-I {{ 27.49; R-II {| 226). Respondent also notes that the Cliffson
transaction, at earliest could have started in February 2010. (RPHB 2 {{7).

On 13 May 2009, the Mangystau Regional department of the MES withdrew its
letters about whether the pipelines were trunk pipelines. Respondent states that
this was in response to the 30 April 2009 letter from the Deputy Minister of the
MES and not to the letter from the Financial Police, dated 21 November 2009, as
asserted by Claimants at C-I{ 91. (R-I'{ 28.14).

On 15 May 2009, the Financial Police issued attachment orders in respect of
KPM’s and TNG’s Subsoil Use Contracts and requested additional documents
from KPM. (R-I {| 29.2; CPHB 2 {[ 38).

On 15 May 2009, the Financial Police notified KPM and TNG that it had seized
Claimants’ equity interests in KPM and TNG two days before, on 13 May 2009.
The asset and equity seizures were designed to prevent KPM and TNG from selling
or transferring their interests during the course of the criminal proceeding against
Mr. Cornegruta. (C-I {/ 121). While Respondent does not admit that the Financial
Police notified KPM and TNG that it had seized KPM’s and TNG’s equity interests
on 13 May 2009, Respondent states that such a seizure would seem entirely
appropriate in the circumstances, and if the Financial Police moved to gain interim
measures of security over KPM and TNG pending the resolution of a bona fide
underlying dispute, this would not be surprising. (R-I { 26.26).

On 18 May 2009, the College of Experts of the Ministry of Justice calculated
KPM’s purported “illegal profits” from oil and gas transportation services at 5.9
million Tenge (approximately USD 48,300) for the period from 2002 through
2008. (C-I § 92). This calculation also showed “illegal profits” of approximately
1,935,547 Tenge (approximately USD 15,000) for March 2007 — May 2008. (C-I {[
119). Respondent denies this and states that that expert considered that the value
of income from illegally operating the trunk pipeline amounted to 65,479,414,197
Tenge for the period from April 2002 — 2008, and that its income during the
relevant period in 2007 and 2008 was 21,673,919,031 Tenge. (R-I {[ 26.23; 26.26;
R-II { 484; RPHB 2 {| 190). Respondent states that this calculation was necessary
to determine whether the crime of illegal entrepreneurship had been triggered. (R-
II { 484). Respondent admits that the Court relied on this document when
determining the amount of fine to be imposed on KPM. All of Claimants’ other
assertions concerning this report are denied. (R-I {[ 27.60).

On 18 May 2009, the Financial Police issued an order on the refusal to initiate a
criminal case. According to this, the Financial Police declined to initiate a criminal

case against Mr. Cornegruta based on the checks carried out by the MES, the
Ministry of Environmental Protection, the Customs Control Committee of the
Ministry of Finances, or the MEMR. (RPHB 2 { 191).

 

On 18 May 2009, Mr. Rakhimov issued application to exclude Claimants’ expert
opinions about the classification of the pipelines. (R-II {{[ 631 - 632). The expert
reports included a report dated 5 January 2009 from the Kazakh Scientific,
Research, and Design Institute of Oil and Gas (a division of KMG) that found the
pipelines owned by KPM and TNG “do not belong to the category of main
pipelines and are designated to ensure the process of hydrocarbons production.”
(C-I { 98, emphasis maintained). The expert reports also included a report that the
Scientific, Research, and Design Institute of Oil and Gas Industry of NIPI Neftegaz
concluded on 9 January 2009 that the pipelines owned by KPM and TNG were
correctly “classified as in-field pipelines.” (C-I{ 99, emphasis maintained). The
court later deemed the Claimants’ expert opinions to be inadmissible. (R-II {{[ 631
- 632). These so-called “expert” opinions did not evidence KPM and TNG’s
requests for those opinions, making it impossible to divine the scope of the request.
There was no indication that the bodies were independent of Claimants, and some
of the experts whose reports were excluded had a role in the construction of the
pipelines and in the legal amendments regarding their status. In any event, they
were not qualified to issue such opinions and had not been appointed pursuant to
Art. 243 of the CPC. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 203 — 207).

On 18 May 2009, the Kazakh Financial Police expressly determined that Anatolie
Stati could “not be held liable for performance of illegal business activities” with
respect to his companies in Kazakhstan. (C-II { 213).

On 19 May 2009, the Financial Police ordered KPM and TNG to provide a
valuation of all the property that it had seized. (C-II { 335; CPHB 2 {{ 38).

On 19 May 2009, Mr. Rakhimov announced the completion of the investigation
and allowed Mr. Cornegruta and his lawyer to study the files of the criminal case.
(R-II { 488).

On 20 May 2009, Mr. Cornegruta’s lawyers submitted a complaint to the Regional
Prosecutor’s office regarding his illegal arrest. (CPHB 2 4 142).

Beginning on 25 May 2009, Mr. Cornegruta had access to lawyers who reviewed
the file with Mr. Cornegruta. A defendant is entitled to an unlimited amount of
time to consider the evidence put against him, as explained by Mr. Kravchenko at
the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability. Mr. Cornegruta and his attorneys had
access to the file until 30 July 2009. (RPHB | {{ 245).

In May 2009, the Financial Police declared the reports from the KMG institute, the
MES research center, NIPI Neftegas, and the Russian institute inadmissible in the
criminal proceeding. Without making her own independent assessment, the judge
also declared them inadmissible. (CPHB 2 { 98).

At least by 5 June 2009, the Prime Minister, the MEMR, the Ministry of Justice,
the Ministry of Finance, and Samruk-Kazyna contemplated a “buyout” of KPM and
TNG and/or a termination of their Subsoil Use Contracts. (CPHB 2 {{ 38).

Respondent notes that C-293, upon which this allegation is based, was obtained in
violation of the law, and it is unclear what reliability it could have. (RPHB | {{{]

On 12 June 2009, Terra Raf and Ascom filed petitions to lift the seizures. (C-0 {[

On 15 June 2009, Mr. Cornegruta submitted a petition to stop the criminal
proceedings against him. (CPHB { 142).

On 15 June 2009, the Financial Police investigation team presented the indictment
dated 15 June 2009 to the prosecution department of the Ministry of Justice. (R-II
ql 446, 490).

Claimants state that they were only able to weather the liquidity storm in the
summer of 2009 by obtaining emergency bridge financing from a group of venture
capitalists (the “Laren Facility”) on 16 June 2009. The Parties agree that the terms
of the Laren Facility were terrible for Claimants (35% interest on a USD 60 million
note, plus the issuance of USD 111 million of new Tristan notes). (C-II { 384,
CPHB 2 {[ 117 (stating 11 June), R-II {J[ 765 — 766; R-268; RPHB 1 {{{[ 58 — 61).

On 16 June 2009, TOTAL E&P’s geologist Philippe Mallard sent Radu Constantin
of Ascom an email containing TOTAL E&P’s findings and concerns about chances
of development, based on the 3D and 2D seismic data received. He requested
additional information, but Claimants never provided it. The email ends with a
recommendation to abandon the Project Zenith. (RPHB | {{{[ 99 — 103).

On 17 June 2009, the Financial Police publically announced that the investigative
phase had concluded and that the four former and current managers of KPM and
TNG would be prosecuted for having realized an “illegal profit” of 147 billion
Tenge (approximately USD 980 million as of June 2009). (C-0 {| 45, C-II {| 602;
CPHB 2 { 38 (calling the 147 billion the potential fine); R-I 26.24).

On 19 June 2009, the third tranche of the 2006 Bonds Project was issued, for USD
111.11 million. (R-I'{ 9.59).

On 23 June 2009, the Financial Police submitted the case to the Public Prosecutor
of the Western Regional Transport for consideration. (R-I {[ 26.24).

On 23 June 2009, KPM and TNG separately filed cases against the Tax Committee
in the Astana Economic Court seeking cancellation of the 10 February 2009
notices. (C-0 {| 64).

On 27 June 2009, the Terra Raf and Ascom petitions to lift the seizures were
denied. (C-0 J 45; C-I | 122).

On 27 June 2009, Mr. Cornegruta was indicted and the Regional Prosecutor’s
Office wrote to Ascom and Terra Raf noting that an international search was
underway for Mr. Cojin. (CPHB 2 {| 38; RPHB 2 { 191).

On 30 June 2009, Squire Sanders confirmed that the 2003 transfer to Terra Raf was
valid, but in light of the MEMR’s claim of violation, recommended that waiver of
the State’s pre-emptive right regarding the 2003 transfer be a condition precedent
to a sale. (CPHB 2 { 117). Respondent states that this is misleading. Squire
Sanders considered it unlikely that MEMR would terminate Contracts 210 and 302
because of the issue, but stated that Claimants had breached Art. 71 of the Subsoil
Law because TNG did not apply for the necessary pre-emptive rights waiver.
(RPHB 2 {{ 279).

On 30 June 2009, Mr. Cornegruta moved to stop the criminal proceedings. This
motion was rejected the following day. (CPHB 2 { 142).

By 30 June 2008, the current ratio for KPM and TNG had decreased from 5.74 at
the year end 2007 to 3.06 and their quick ratios had decreased from 5.33 at the year
end 2007 to 2.91. The cash ratio had decreased from 0.51 to 0.13 for the same
period. (RPHB 2 {[ 67).

On 2 July 2009, the self-imposed deadline to extend Contract 302 expired, without
an extension of that contract. (CPHB 2 {ff 38, 151).

On 2 July 2009, Prof. Suleymenov, author of Kazakhstan’s Law on Oil, issued an
expert legal opinion that KPM’s pipelines are not “main.” (CPHB 2 §f 61, 98).

On 10 July 2009, a Fitch Ratings Press Release indicated that market observers
were concerned about “weak corporate governance standards at Tristan.” (RPHB
2461).

The trial involving Mr. Cornegruta and KPM lasted from 30 July until 18
September 2009. (CPHB 2 { 98 (trial until 14 September, verdict on 18
September). At the trial, the State introduced a letter Mr. Cornegruta had written on
13 June 2008 to the ARNM as its principal evidence that Mr. Cornegruta had
“confessed” that KPM operated a trunk pipeline. (C-0 { 47; C-I {ff 115 — 116;
CPHB 2 {[ 38; R-I § 27.5). In his defense at trial, Mr. Cornegruta’s counsel argued
that Mr. Cornegruta is not an entrepreneur, that he is an employee of KPM, that he
does not own KPM, that his June 13, 2008 letter was not a “‘confession,” and that
the KPM gathering system pipelines are not “trunk” pipelines.

Respondent states that KMG EP withdrew from Project Zenith in July 2009 after
deciding that it was not commercially sensible to purchase the assets due to the
amount of debt involved. (R-II {{[ 359, 790).

Claimants state that, in July 2009, KNOC re-entered the bid process. Claimants
state that KNOC examined the Project Zenith data room, Claimants conducted a
management presentation for them in July, and that representatives of KNOC also
went for a site visit of the properties in August of 2009. KNOC was only willing to
proceed with a binding bid after it had spoken with the Kazakh authorities about
the properties. Claimants later learned that KNOC had spoken with the Kazakh
authorities in late August or early September 2009. After that conversation,
Claimants never heard from KNOC again. (C-I { 188; C-II {{] 402 er seq.).
Respondent disputes the above and submits that Claimants have not provided any
proof of these contentions and argue that KNOC was not even involved in Phase II

of Project Zenith. (R-II { 798). After the Hearing on Quantum, Respondent
accepted that KNOC had visited Claimants in Bucharest for a meeting and
presentation on KPM and TNG. During examination, Dr. Kim of KNOC stated
KNOC had not re-entered negotiations. (RPHB | {[ 95).

On 24 July 2009, TOTAL E&P informed Renaissance Capital that it had left
Project Zenith. (RPHB 1 { 104).

On 31 July 2009, RBS reported that it valued KPM and TNG (without Contract
302) at between USD 855 million and 1 billion, as of 1 October 2009. (CPHB 1| {
38).

On 30 and 31 July 2009, Mr. Zlupacarov of the Financial Police had chased Mr.
Cornegruta’s attorneys and his wife, while driving after and filming them from his
car. (CPHB | {{ 203).

In August 2009, Starleigh, a Kazakh-owned company that Claimants believe to be
owned and controlled by Mr. Kulibayev, contacted Claimants. Starleigh was
represented by a middle man, Mr. Arvind Tiku, whom Claimants understand to be
one of Mr. Kulibayev’s business partners. Starleigh examined the Project Zenith
data room. (C-I {{{ 189 - 190). Respondent states that Claimants have provided no
evidence that Mr. Kulibayev is linked to Starleigh or that Starleigh is in any way
linked to the Kazakh government. (R-II ff 341, 346 — 347).

On 6 August 2009, the second day of Mr. Cornegruta’s trial, Mr. Cornegruta’s
defense counsel requested that the judge order Financial Police officer Zlupacarov,
who was present, dismissed from the courtroom and the proceeding. (CPHB | {
203; RPHB 2 {{ 241). Although the hearing was public and Mr. Zlupacarov was
permitted to attend, Mr. Cornegruta’s request was considered and immediately
granted. (RPHB 2 {{ 241).

In a supplementary expert opinion on 25 August 2009, the Russian Science and
Research Institute for the Construction and Operation of Pipelines and Energy
Facilities confirmed that KPM’s pipeline was a “field pipeline” and that the
unfounded report of the Kazakh Ministry of Justice “cannot serve as a ground to
consider [KPM'’s pipeline] as a main pipeline.” (C-I1 { 289).

On 25 August 2009, the Russian Joint Stock company VNIIST concluded that
KPM’s pipeline is not “main.” (CPHB 2 ff 61, 98).

On 26 August 2009, Mr. Cornegruta’s defense counsel moved for postponement of
less than one week so that the judge and counsel could question the authors of the
expert reports that contradicted the conclusions of Mr. Baymaganbetov. The
motion was denied, without explanation. (CPHB | {{ 201).

In August 2009, Kazakhstan, the Governor of the Mangystau Region, KazAzot,
and Mitsubishi confirmed their intention to go forward with the ammonia-
carbamide complex. (C-I J 61).

Claimants report that, on 26 August 2009, the Governor of the Mangystau Region
asked Prime Minister Massimov to accelerate the State’s cancellation of TNG’s

and KPM’s Subsoil Use Contracts and to transfer TNG’s assets to KazAzot. The
Governor referred to instructions dated 5 June 2009 given by the Kazakh Prime
Minister to the MEMR, the Minister of Finance, the Ministry of Justice, and the
multi-billion sovereign wealth fund of Kazakhstan, Samruk-Kazyna. Claimants
state that the Prime Minister instructed these Kazakh authorities to orchestrate the
termination of Claimants’ Subsoil Use Contracts. (C-I { 61; CPHB 1 { 316).
Respondent states that the letter in question is a complaint concerning the failure
by the MEMR to provide the necessary information concerning its investigations of
KPM and TNG. The letter calls for action in light of the deteriorating condition of
TNG and KPM. (R-I § 19.25). Respondent challenges Claimants’ characterization
of this letter and says that Governor Kusherbayev was aiming at a regular purchase
of the companies because of the problems that were surrounding them. (R-II {[
326). It in no way proposes an expropriation. (RPHB 1 {398 — 403). Respondent
also states that Claimants’ possession of this confidential and internal letter,
identified as C-293, points to serious corruption on behalf of Claimants. (R-II
214).

Respondent states that the 27 August 2009 meeting referenced in exhibit C-294 is
not an indication of a planned government taking. Claimants have confirmed that
the state of TNG and KPM was dire in the summer of 2009, so it should be no
surprise that the government was concerned about the companies and the potential
social consequences. Claimants have produced no evidence for their contention
that the meeting was a working group to discuss ways to “finish off the planned
taking.” (RPHB 2 § 381).

On 29 August 2009, Mr. Baymaganbetov was cross-examined. (RPHB 2 { 240).

On 8 and 9 September 2009, the Astana Economic Court ruled against KPM and
TNG’s 23 June 2009 filing and found that the tax assessments were proper. KPM
and TNG appealed the ruling. (C-0 {| 64; R-I'{ 19.24; CPHB 2 { 128).

On 17 September 2009, TNG wrote to MEMR regarding the promised Contract
302 extension and requested execution of Addendum No. 9. (CPHB 2 {[ 151).

On 18 September 2009, the Aktau City Court of the Mangystau Oblast rendered a
guilty verdict against Mr. Cornegruta for illegally engaging in entrepreneurial
activities by operating KPM trunk pipelines without a license. (C-I {{ 118, CPHB 2
QM 38, 61, 74, 98; R-I { 27.58; R-II {{[ 446, 645; RPHB 2 {{ 266). In accordance
with the Court Decision, KPM was ordered to pay the illegal revenue in the amount
of 21,675,854,578.00 Tenge (approximately, USD 145,475,534.08) to the
Kazakhstan state budget. (C-0 | 50; C-I { 119, C-II { 318, CPHB 2 {ff 38, 81, R-II

imprisonment, and Respondent reports that he escaped from prison. (C-0 {| 49; C-I
{ 118; R-I{ 9.79; RPHB 1 { 303).

On 21 September 2009, President Nazarbayev’s Head of Administration issued an
order regarding the “free of charge transfer of [Claimants’] assets.” (CPHB 2 {|
38). Respondent notes that C-294, upon which this allegation is based, was
obtained in violation of the law, and it is unclear what reliability it could have.

On 22 September 2009, Claimants requested an official copy of the verdict. (C-0 J
51; CPHB | {{ 208; CPHB 2 {| 98; RPHB 2 {[ 269). The request was signed by
“Acting General Director of KPM Oskolkov V.V.”, and Claimants have provided no
evidence that Mr. Oskolkov was properly appointed or was authorized to make the
application. There is no evidence that the request was ever received by the court.
(RPHB 2 {{ 269).

A 28 September 2009 letter from MEMR to the Ministry of Industry and Trade
noted the risk of arbitration as one of the reasons why it would be better to obtain
KPM and TNG through an acquisition rather than a premature termination of the
Subsoil Use Contracts. (C-II {{ 392; CPHB 1 {{ 321). Respondent explains that the
MEMR was responding to the concern at the decline of the businesses of TNG and
KPM and the resultant social problems, caused by Claimants’ decision to wind
down operations. The solution under consideration was the transfer of KPM and
TNG into state control. (R-I {{{ 19.20, 19.26; RPHB 2 {[ 381). Respondent states
that the notion of a gratuitous transfer of assets was rejected by MEMR. (R-II {[
327). Respondent also states that Claimants’ possession of this confidential and
internal letter, identified as C-294, points to serious corruption on behalf of
Claimants. (R-II { 214).

On 30 September 2009, the Financial Police ordered the Aktau territorial customs
body to conduct a new audit of KPM based on its failure to pay the Crude Oil
Export Tax for its January 2009 exports. (C-0 75; C-I'{ 168; CPHB 2 {ff 38, 128).

On | October 2009, Mr. Cornegruta appealed the criminal judgment of the Aktau
City Court. (CPHB 2 {| 98).

In October 2009, Starleigh presented an initial bid of USD 450 million for
Claimants’ properties. (C-I[ 190).

4 October 2009 was the last day that an appeal could be filed in the case against
KPM and Mr. Cornegruta. KPM did not appeal the sentence of 18 September 2009
within the 15 days allowed. (R-II { 636; RPHB | { 304, RPHB 2 {[ 268).

On 22 October 2009, the Financial Police interviewed Mr. Condorachi, the General
Counsel of KPM and Deputy General Counsel of TNG, regarding KPM’s alleged
obligation to pay 2008 export taxes. (C-I {| 168; CPHB 2 {fff 38, 128).

On 28 October 2009, the Civil Collegium of Astana Court reversed the Astana
Economic Court’s ruling of 10 February 2009 and remanded it for a new hearing at
the Specialized Interdistrict Economic Court. (C-0 {| 64; CPHB 2 {{ 128).

In November 2009, Starleigh dropped its offer from USD 450 million to USD 350
million, due to concerns about the USD 145 million fine that had been imposed on
KPM in connection with criminal action brought by the State. (C-I { 190).

Respondent states that KMG NC did not express an interest in purchasing TNG
and KPM until November 2009, and explains that it took an interest in the assets in
order to play a “white knight” role. (R-II { 360).

In November 2009, Claimants were invited to attend a meeting with KMG in
Amsterdam. When Anatolie Stati and Mr. Lungu arrived, they saw principals of
Claimants’ main noteholders leaving the meeting room. The noteholders told them
that KMG had just offered 25 cents on the dollar to purchase their interests, which
the noteholders refused. Anatolie Stati and Mr. Lungu then met with
representatives of KMG, who presented them with an offer of USD 20 million for
their equity interests, which they refused. (C-0 {[ 84 (stating September 2009); C-I
q 192; C-II { 386).

Claimants report that, in November 2009 (or in early 2010), they received an offer
from Starleigh for USD 50 million and a buyout of the noteholders, which
Claimants refused. (C-I{ 190; C-II {{{[ 387, 415).

Claimants report that, on 3 November 2009, in an effort to pressure KPM into
paying the Crude Oil Export Tax, the Financial Police interrogated and intimidated
Mr. Cornegruta (in jail) and other employees of KPM. The interrogation of Mr.
Cornegruta regarded KPM’s alleged obligation to pay 2008 export taxes. The
Aktau territorial customs body also informed KPM that it was required to pay the
Crude Oil Export Tax for its January 2009 exports, amounting to USD 4 million.
(C-0 { 75; C-I {| 168; CPHB 2 {fj 38, 128).

Mr. Cornegruta appealed his verdict with the Mangystau Regional Court. On 12
November 2009, the Regional Court upheld the Aktau City Court’s verdicts against
both Mr. Cornegruta and KPM. (C-0 { 52; C-I { 120, CPHB 2 {ff 38, 98; R-I 7
27.60; R-II § 446, 586, 646; RPHB 2 ¥ 266). Judge Ryskalieva’s decision was
scrutinized by three judges, all of whom agreed with her. (R-II { 586).
Respondent admits that KPM was not a named party in either the initial trial or the
subsequent appeal. However, it is denied that KPM was not represented in either
hearing. (R-I {[ 27.60). Neither KPM (which was able to) nor Mr. Cornegruta
appealed to the Supreme Court. (RPHB 2 {{ 266).

Grand Petroleum offered to purchase KPM and TNG for USD 1.15 billion. (CPHB
24 38).

In an instruction of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated 19
November 2009, the President highlighted the inadmissibility of a production
shutdown at the enterprises TNG, KPM, Borankol Gas Treatment Plant, TOO
“KASKO” and the company “Caspian Gas Corporation” in connection with the
conducted inspections. (R-I {[ 18.7; CPHB 2 {[ 38). The President instructed
responsible authorities to revisit these issues in view of anti-crisis measures of the
Government. (R-II { 332).

The President issued a further instruction on 23 November 2009, which expressed
the President’s concern that the investigations of KPM and TNG might be
interfering with the operation of those companies. (R-I {| 19.24).

On 23 November 2009, Mr. Cornegruta was transferred from a temporary
detention facility in Aktau to the prison in Atyrau. (C-I J 120).

eighteen different motor vehicles belonging to KPM. It also instructed the Road
Police Department to take notice of the vehicles’ registrations and to seize and

copy of this order on 1 February 2010. (C-I {] 126; R-I {| 29.7).

On 22 January 2010, Mr. Mynbayev ordered an unscheduled inspection. (CPHB |

On 25 January 2010, the Committee on Judicial Administration - a division of the
Supreme Court of Kazakhstan - wrote to Mr. Stejar of KPM to inform him that the
judicial acts pertaining to the Writ of Execution for 21.6 billion Tenge remained
unexecuted. Further, the Deputy Administrator of Mangystau Oblast courts, Mr.
Tursynbayev, instructed the Chief of Aktau Territorial Department to execute
enforcement procedures by 30 January 2010. The instructions included: (i) to visit
the Borankol Village to confirm whether KPM was operating, and if so, to make an
inventory of and attach its property; (ii) to demand all documentation from KPM;
and (iii) to make note of and inventory any motor vehicles discovered that were
previously attached. (C-I J 127; C-124).

On 25 January 2010, KPM filed a request with the Aktau City Court to reinstate the
missed time for the appeal of the verdict of 18 September 2009 and filed an
independent appeal of that verdict with the Board of Appeals of the Mangystau
Regional Court. (C-0 { 53, CPHB 2 { 98; R-II {| 647).

From 25 January — 5 February, the MEMR noted that it was still considering the
draft Addendum No. 9 to Contract 302. (CPHB 2 { 151).

From 25 January — 6 February 2010, the MEMR inspection team noted that

From 25 January 2010 — 6 February 2010, the Department for Direct Investments
in Subsoil Exploitation, the Department for Development of Oil Industry, and the
Inspection Department for Geology and Subsoil Exploitation of the MEMR
conducted an unscheduled comprehensive audit of KPM and TNG regarding their

II { 290; CPHB 2 {{f[ 38, 61).

On 26 January 2010, the Ministry of Finance commenced bankruptcy proceedings
against KPM. (CPHB 2 {fff 38, 128).

On 29 January 2010, the Aktau City Court denied KPM’s right to appeal the 18
September 2009 decision as untimely. Respondent explained that KPM’s failure to
appeal in time could not be attributed to failures by the Republic and that everyone

had knowledge of the appeals deadline. (C-0 | 53; R-II {{{[ 636, 647; RPHB | {
305).

On 3 February 2010, the Ministry of Finance notified KPM that it was monitored
for bankruptcy on 26 January 2010 for 3.8 billion Tenge, including interest. The
back taxes and penalties regarding the corporate income tax represented 85% of the
amount notified by the Ministry of Finance, or 3.2 billion Tenge (approximately
USD 40 million). (C-0 { 65; C-I { 160, CPHB 2 {[ 38; R-I { 29.3). Respondent
states that the bankruptcy proceedings were unsuccessful. (R-II { 377).

The unscheduled inspection ended on 6 February 2010. MEMR concluded that
KPM and TNG were in compliance with the Kazakh law, including with respect to
the pipelines. (C-0 {| 55; C-I {| 18; C-II {| 290; CPHB 2 {{[ 38, 61). The MEMR
report clearly states that the pipelines are part of a “single technological process”
and are, therefore, not main pipelines. (CPHB 2 {{{[ 61, 74). According to the 6
February 2010 Report of the MEMR on Unscheduled Inspection for KPM, and the
5 February 2010 MEMR Report on Unscheduled Inspection for TNG, Claimants
invested more than USD 1.1 billion (USD 772 after deduction of taxes and
administrative expenses). (C-II ] 121).

On 8 February 2010, KPM challenged the appeal court’s refusal to reinstate the
time period for appeal. The letter also challenged the court’s refusal to provide a
copy of the 18 September 2009 judgment. (CPHB 2 {[ 98; RPHB 2 {{ 269).

On 13 February 2010, Claimants negotiated the sale of 100% of the shares and
participatory interests in KPM and TNG to Cliffson Company S.A. (C-0 { 85
(stating 2 February); C-II {| 393 — 395). The total value of the agreement,
including the buy-out of the companies’ noteholders and payment for Claimants’
equity interests and the assumption of liabilities, exceeded USD 920 million. (C-I {
193 (stating USD 930 million); C-II {J 388; CPHB 2 {{ 371 and 418; R-II { 814).
Claimants state that this was a reduced value taking the criminal judgment and its
enforcement against KPM into account. (CPHB 2 { 38). USD 267 million
represented the equity interests in TNG, KPM, and Tristan. (C-II { 418). One
condition of this sale was that MOG would grant permission for the sale and waive
the State’s alleged pre-emptive right to purchase KPM and TNG. (C-I J 194; R-IT {.
815). MOG conditioned permission for the sale on removal of the attachment
orders and on its receipt of information about the financial solvency of Cliffson
Company and about its technical and managerial capabilities, and on the receipt of
other additional materials. (C-I { 194). Respondent states that it cooperated fully
with Claimants, but that Claimants delayed their waiver application by 2 months
and ultimately failed to provide the information necessary for an approval and a
waiver. (R-II {{ 816 — 817).

On 16 February 2010, KPM submitted a claim to suspend the enforcement
measures. (CPHB 2 {[ 98).

On 17 February 2010, the President of the Blagovest fund wrote to Minister
Mynbayev to make a suggestion to “resolve the question of nationalization of the
assets posed in 2008.” (CPHB 2 § 38).

On 19 February 2010, the Chief of the Aktau Territorial Department issued a writ
of execution, noting that prior collection orders had gone unfulfilled. This order
formally attached the 2,186 assets listed in the 26 January 2010 inventory and it
specifically warned KPM’s General Manager, Mr. Stejar, that he could face
criminal responsibility for embezzlement or alienation of that property. KPM
received this order on | March 2010. (C-I'{ 129; R-I {[ 29.7).

On 23 February 2010, the Chief of Aktau Territorial Department issued an order
prohibiting KPM from executing import and export formalities regarding the
transportation of oil. It meant that KPM could not deliver oil from its gathering
system to the main pipeline operated by KazTransOil. (C-I J 130; R-I{[ 29.7).

On 23 February 2010, in response to the Akim (Governor) of the Mangystau
Region’s proposal for TNG to borrow funds from State agencies to complete the
LPG Plant (CPHB 2 { 219). Anatolie Stati wrote to the Akim to seek his assistance
in resolving the companies’ legal problems. (CPHB 2 § 142).

On 24 February 2010, the Regional Customs Committee notified KPM and TNG
that the companies were liable for Crude Oil Export Tax on their January 2009
exports. (C-I { 170; CPHB 2 {ff 38, 128; R-I J 30.56).

Akim Kusherbayev wrote to Prime Minister Massimov on 24 February 2010, in an
effort to broker a compromise by submitting a proposal made by Mr. Stati to the
Prime Minister. Under Anatolie Stati’s proposal, Claimants were to complete
construction of the LPG Plant if claims against KPM and TNG were dropped. (R-
IL {| 324 — 325; CPHB 2 {| 221). Respondent also states that Claimants’ possession
of this confidential and internal letter, identified as C-665, points to serious
corruption on behalf of Claimants. (R-II { 214).

On 25 February 2010, KPM appealed the decision dismissing its claim to suspend
enforcement measures. (CPHB 2 { 98).

On 25 February 2010, Anatolie Stati sent a second letter to the Akim of the
Mangystau Region, seeking his assistance. (CPHB 2 {{ 142).

On 26 February 2010, the Chief of Aktau Territorial Department dismissed KPM’s
challenge to the writ of enforcement and issued an order to “attach the oil pipeline

from [the] OTP to Opornaya CRMB [Commodities and Raw Material Base of

Opornaya Station] of 18 kilometers long” and KPM’s accumulator oil tanks, in
order to fulfill the previous execution orders. This order also prohibited KPM from
transferring oil to the main pipeline operated by KazTransOil once its accumulator
tanks reached capacity. (C-I {] 131, CPHB 2 { 98; R-I J 29.7).

On 3 March 2010, the Interdistrict Economic Court of Mangystau Region
dismissed KPM’s action of January 2010. (C-0 | 75; C-I 169).

On 4 March 2010, the Chief of the Aktau Territorial Department appealed to the
President of the Second Aktau City Court for a change in the method and order of
execution. He noted that, despite attaching fifty-two settlement accounts and
numerous assets, “monetary resources by collection orders do not arrive to the
deposit account.” Claimants state that, as a result, he requested that the

three previously-attached plots of real property, the 18 kilometer pipeline, KPM’s
Contract 305 over the Borankol field, and KPM’s subsoil use license No. 309. (C-I
133).

 

On 5 March 2010, KPM appealed the decision dismissing its challenge to the writ

vehicles, the 18 kilometer pipeline, the field camp, and the Borankol field that were
attached in previous orders. (C-I {] 134; R-I { 29.7).

On 16 March 2010, KPM moved to alter execution procedures so that production
on the Borankol field could continue. (C-I J 135).

On 17 March 2010, the Acting Head of Aktau Territorial Department of Judicial
Executors complied with KPM’s request and issued two orders that suspended
execution of the orders of 23 and 26 February 2010, respectively. Both confirmed
that suspension was necessary “to avoid the suspension of production activity of
‘Kazpolmunai’ LLP” / to ensure that KPM and TNG’s business was not unduly
affected by the execution orders. (C-I J 137; R-I | 29.7).

On 20 March 2010, the Acting Chief of Aktau Territorial Department of Judicial
Executors proposed that the Prosecutor initiate a criminal case against Mr. Stejar,
then-General Manager of KPM, for failing to enforce the 29 December 2009 writ
of execution against KPM. (C-I { 138).

On 26 March 2010, KPM appealed the criminal judgment to the Cassation Court.
(CPHB 2 {| 98).

On 31 March 2010, the Central Customs Committee cancelled the 24 February
2010 notifications to KPM and TNG and stated that, pursuant to their Subsoil Use
Contracts, KPM and TNG were not liable for export taxes from October 2008
onward. (C-I {| 170; CPHB 2 {{f[ 38, 128; R-I { 30.56; R-II {{ 386). Respondent
states that, in total, KPM paid USD 700,000 in respect of customs duties, and this
payment was returned following the withdrawal of charges. (R-I {| 30.57).
Respondent denies Claimants’ positions that they paid USD 10 million or that they
paid USD 12.77 million, USD 2.6 million of which was refunded. (C-0 J 74; C-I |

On 12 April 2010, Claimants submitted applications for approval of the Cliffson
sale and waiver of Kazakhstan’s pre-emptive rights to the MOG and Ministry of
Industry and Technology, respectively. (C-II 389; R-II {{ 817).

On 23 April 2010, the Astana appellate court reversed the 25 December 2009
decision against KPM and TNG by the Astana Economic Court and found that
KPM and TNG properly deducted drilling expenses. The Tax Committee’s appeal
was dismissed. (C-0 {[ 66; CPHB 2 {[ 128).

In connection with the bankruptcy proceeding, the State filed a request with the
Specialized Interdistrict Economic Court of Mangystau Region for external
management of KPM (appointment of a bankruptcy administrator) on 26 April
2010. (C-0 65; C-I { 160). This request was dismissed by the Interdistrict
Economic Court on procedural grounds, and a subsequent replacement request was
withdrawn by the State. (C-0 { 66).

On 30 April 2010, the MOG responded to Claimants’ 12 April 2010 request by: (1)
requesting additional information regarding the terms of the transaction and the
financial and technical abilities of Cliffson, (2) noting that based on Kazakhstan’s
seizures of the companies’ assets, transfers of the shares of KPM and TNG were
forbidden, and (3) concluding that the transaction would only be approved if KPM
and TNG satisfied the requirements necessary to release the attachment of their
shares. (C-II { 389, CPHB 2 {[ 38; R-II { 818). Respondent states that Claimants
failed to respond to this letter. (R-II { 820).

On 6 May 2010, Cliffson executed an amendment to the SPA extending the time
for the transaction. (CPHB 2 {[ 374).

On 6 May 2010, Respondent sent a notice of breach, stating that TNG had failed to
comply with the annual working program in respect of Contract 302 and requested
response by 20 May 2010. (R-I { 31.137; CPHB 2 {[ 151). TNG received this on 7
May 2010. (C-I{ 197).

On 7 May 2010, the MOG notified TNG of inadequate fulfillment of license and
contract provisions for 2009 and requested that TNG “remove delays” in its 2009
Contract 302 work program and present to the Ministry a draft appendix for the
2010 work program within one month. (C-I {{ 197; CPHB 2 {{ 151).

On 11 May 2010, KPM appealed the decision regarding enforcement to the
Cassation Court. (CPHB 2 {[ 98).

On 18 May 2010, there was an order not to prosecute Anatolie Stati, since there
were no grounds on which to prosecute him, personally. (CPHB | {{ 312).

On 27 May 2010, TNG wrote to the MOG, explaining that it had submitted an
application for a two-year extension of the exploration period in its Contract 302

submitted the addendum for execution dated 30 April 2009, and that TNG never
received an executed extension from MOG. TNG explained that it, therefore,
suspended its exploration operations in the Contract 302 properties. TNG argued
that it had fulfilled all of its contractual obligations. (C-I { 198).

On 1 June 2010, the MOG sent an additional request to KPM and TNG for
information regarding the Cliffson transaction. (C-II {[ 389; R-II { 821).

On 9 June 2010, the Court Execution Body of the Mangystau Region - the Acting
Chief of Aktau Territorial Department of Judicial Executors - ordered the sale of
KPM’s assets as a single lot, so as to avoid any suspension of activities. (C-0 | 87;
C-I{ 139; CPHB 2 { 98; R-I { 29.7).

On 15 June 2010, Claimants wrote to Cliffson regarding Cliffson’s “backing out”
of the so-called Cliffson transaction. (CPHB 2 {[ 375).

On 15 June 2010, the Acting Chief of Aktau Territorial Department issued a
“repeated warning” to Mr. Stejar of KPM, claiming that KPM operated and carried
out oil and gas extraction, sold the products, and gained income, but did not

instructed KPM to execute the court order by paying 21.6 billion Tenge in full or
by transferring assets corresponding to the amount owed, within two weeks’ time.
(C-Iq 139; R-I 29.7).

On 18 June 2010, KPM challenged the valuation of its property and the actions of
state executors. (CPHB 2 {[ 98).

On 22 June 2010, the Kazakh Court of Cassation dismissed the Tax Committee’s
claims that KPM and TNG owed USD 62 million in corporate back taxes for
allegedly improperly deducting drilling expenses. The Court affirmed the appellate
court decision in favor of KPM and TNG. (CPHB 2 {J 38, 128).

On 23 June 2010, Claimants replied to the MOG requests of 30 April and | June
2010 regarding the proposed Cliffson transaction. (C-II { 390). The Parties dispute
whether Claimants provided all of the necessary information. (C-II { 390; R-II {[
822). Claimants state that they received no reply from Kazakhstan. (C-II { 390).

On 24 June 2010, a change in the Subsoil Use Law was approved, which allowed
Kazakhstan to terminate contracts when a contractor failed to cure 2 or more
contract violations. (CPHB 1 {{ 278).

After receiving no reply from the MOG, Cliffson wrote to MOG, stating that it
refused to purchase the interests in TNG and KPM. (C-I {| 193 — 195).

On 25 June 2010, KPM submitted its complaint to the 9 June 2010 enforcement
order. (CPHB 2 {| 98).

From 25 — 29 June 2010, there were unscheduled inspections of KPM and TNG
from at least 7 agencies, on the order of the Prime Minister and with the
involvement of the Financial Police and the GPO. (CPHB 2 { 38).

On 28 June 2010, the GPO received a complaint from Messrs. Sadyrbaev,
Makashev, Esenov, and Sagindikov about KPM and TNG related to non-payment
of salaries, mass dismissal of employees, and failure to comply with environmental
legislation and legislation on subsoil use. The complaint requested that the GPO
take measures to prevent the loss of deposits and to establish a stable social
environment. According to the petition, the individuals who submitted it were
residents of the Beyneu District of Mangystau Province, where the Tolkyn and
Borankol oil deposits as well as the KPM & TNG oil exploitation infrastructure
were situated. (R-II {{[ 305, 676; CPHB 1 { 265; CPHB 2 { 178 (referring to
alleged receipt)).

On 28 June 2010, Claimants provided documents related to its working program to
the MEMR. (C-I 209).

Claimants and Respondent dispute aspects of the June — July 2010 inspections.
Claimants state that a dozen Government agencies sent notices that unscheduled
inspections of KPM and TNG would commence. (C-I {| 200). Respondent states
that only 5 ministries requested further inspections. (R-I {[ 31.98; R-II {{ 306).
Contrary to Claimants’ assertion, Respondent does not admit that the MOG
covered the same issues 6 months previously. (R-I { 31.98). Respondent admits
that TNG’s compliance with Contract 302 was investigated as part of the July 2010
investigations. (R-I [ 31.138). Respondent states that the inspections initiated with
the GPO and had nothing to do with the Financial Police. (RPHB 2 {{ 45).

On 29 June 2010, the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies’ Geology and
Subsoil Use Committee ordered a two-week inspection of KPM and TNG to
determine whether the companies were in compliance with subsoil use legislation.
The Chief State Ecological Inspector of Mangystau Oblast notified KPM and TNG
that an unscheduled inspection regarding compliance with environmental
protection legislation would take place beginning 30 June 2010. The State Labor
Inspector sent notices to KPM and TNG that unscheduled inspections would take
place. The Immigration Police sent notifications of inspections that were to take
place from 1 — 29 July 2010, in order to ensure that neither KPM nor TNG was in
violation of Kazakhstan’s immigration legislation. (C-I {{[ 199 - 201). Finally,
Kazakhstan ordered its second round of unscheduled inspections of KPM and
TNG, to take place in the same time period, to assess compliance with their subsoil
use contract obligations. (C-II { 343; CPHB 2 { 178).

On 30 June 2010, the Ecology Committee began its unscheduled inspection of
KPM and TNG. (CPHB 2 {{ 178).

From June — July 2010, the Department for Emergency Situation carried out
unscheduled inspections of KPM and TNG. (CPHB 2 {{ 178).

From 30 June — 15 July 2010, MOG carried out its unscheduled inspections of
KPM and TNG. (CPHB 2 {{ 178).

From 30 June — 16 July 2010, the Geology and Subsoil Use Committee of the
Ministry of Industry and New Technology carried out its unscheduled inspection of
KPM and TNG. (CPHB 2 {{ 178).

From 30 June — 29 July 2010, the Labor Department carried out its unscheduled
inspections of KPM and TNG.

By July 2010, the LPG Plant was over 90% complete. (C-I { 64).

By July 2010, KPM and TNG were both in breach of the Minimum Work
Programs. (R-II {{{[ 657, 659, 660).

From | July — 29 July 2010 the Immigration Police carried out their unscheduled
inspections of KPM and TNG. (CPHB 2 {{ 178).

On 3 July 2010, the Ecology Department issued an act of inspection for its
environmental audit of KPM and TNG. (CPHB 2 { 178).

Claimants state that, on 4 July 2010, the Financial Police arrived on KMG / TNG
premises to conduct their investigation. The Financial Police requested access to
the Human Resources Department. Claimants state that they feared that a search
through personnel files would lead to another arrest and ordered the middle-
management of KPM and TNG to evacuate Kazakhstan. (C-I { 203; CPHB | {
270). Respondent puts Claimants to proof that this investigation occurred and that
it caused Anatolie Stati to instruct the evacuation of middle management from
KPM. (R-I{ 31.98).

Claimants state that, on 9 July 2010, a representative from Mangystau Oblast’s
Entrepreneurship and Industry Department, a division of the Regional Authority of
Mangystau, called TNG to inform it that Kazakh Prime Minister K.K. Massimov
planned to visit the LPG Plant during a working trip to the region. He instructed
TNG to prepare and/or construct: (i) landing pads in the vicinity of the LPG Plant
to support the arrival of three helicopters; (ii) a presentation of the LPG Plant
project, including photographs, technological specifications, and remaining
financing required; and (iii) a platform on which discussion of the project could
take place. (C-I | 204; CPHB 2 {{{[ 38, 178).

According to Claimants, on 9 July 2010, Financial Police officer S. Rakhimov
reported to the Chief of Financial Police referencing ongoing inspections. (CPHB
2 { 178). Respondent states that, at the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Mr. S. Rakhimov
denied writing the report. (RPHB 2 {[ 46).

On 9 July 2010 and on 12 July 2010, KPM and TNG, respectively, challenged the
29 December 2010 transfer price tax assessment. (R-I {{ 30.65).

Claimants state that, on 12 July 2010, the Governor’s office again contacted TNG
to request that it make its land cruiser (which had been seized earlier that year),
other automobiles, and drivers available for the entire delegation. The members of
the Government delegation would include the Prime Minister, the Minister of Oil
and Gas, the regional Governor, and several other high-level officials. (C-I {| 205;
CPHB 2 {[ 178).

On 14 July 2010, the MOG sent notices to KPM and TNG that the companies were
in violation of their Subsoil Use Contracts 210 and 305. (R-I {{ 31.19; C-II J 346,
CPHB | { 296, CPHB 2 {f 74, 178; RPHB 1 {[ 360; RPHB 2 {{ 354). The notices

from the MOG were dated 14 July 2010, but were not received by KPM and TNG
until 16 July 2010. (R-I { 31.54). The notices set out (1) the contract to which the
notice related, (2) the contractual breaches by KPM and TNG, (3) a deadline within
which to respond, and (4) the consequences for failing to respond to the notice. (R-
I { 31.107). The notices gave KPM and TNG until 19 July 2010 to “submit
explanations on reasons of non-execution of contract terms and all necessary
documents, ascertaining removal of the above-mentioned violations, as well as to
inform [the MOG] on measures taken in order to avoid violation of contract
terms.” Respondent reports that the violations in the notices included “admissions”
by KPM and TNG that they had operated trunk oil and gas pipelines without a
license and 13 additional alleged violations for which Claimants state that the State
had provided no prior notice to KPM or TNG. (R-I {{f 31.103 e¢ seg.). Claimants
report that the notices listed 16 alleged violations. The notice further provided that
“[i]n case of failure to comply with the request set forth in this Notice within the
established time limit, the Competent Body is entitled to terminate the
Contract[s].”" (C-0 J 88; C-I JJ 20, 206 — 208, 332). Respondent states that the
violations contained in the notice of 14 July 2010 were detected by the competent
authority as a result of permanent monitoring of the compliance by the subsurface
users of their contractual obligations. (R-I {{ 31.42). The audits proved that
production activities at KPM and TNG had virtually stopped; there was little
chance of employee salaries being paid. (R-II { 692). The Parties state that, by this
time, the majority of TNG and KPM senior and middle management had left
Kazakhstan. (R-II { 698; C-1 { 218).

On 14 July 2010, the MOG sent a notice of contract violations, which treated
Contract 302 as still in force. (CPHB 2 { 151).

Claimants allege that the inspections may have never been officially concluded.
(C-II {| 346).

On 19 July 2010, Claimants submitted written answers and explanations
concerning each violation alleged in the 14 July 2010 notice. (C-0 { 89, CPHB 2 {|
178; RPHB 1 { 361, RPHB 2 {[ 354).

On 20 July 2010, the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies issued its acts of
inspections for the unscheduled inspections of KPM and TNG. (CPHB 2 { 178).

On 21 July 2010, the State delivered to KPM and TNG two written notices
terminating KPM Subsoil Use Contract 305 covering the Borankol field, and
terminating TNG Subsoil Use Contract 210 covering the Tolkyn field. (R-I {]
31.129; CPHB 2 { 178). The State did not deliver a specific written notice
terminating TNG Subsoil Use Contract 302 covering the Tabyl Block, which the
State says expired on 30 March 2009. (C-0 {{{[ 59, 89; C-I ff 21, 217). On the same
date, pursuant to the legislation, the MOG and KMG agreed to two trust
management agreements over the subsoil areas for the Tolkyn and Borankol.
(CPHB 2 {| 38, 178). Respondent stressed that these agreements transferred the
property into temporary possession of KMG NC as a result of the termination of
the contracts until a new subsoil user is found. (R-I J 31.151; R-II { 701). While
terminating the contracts, the State made no claim that KPM and TNG owed
outstanding corporate income taxes, transfer pricing taxes or export duties. (CPHB
24 128).

Nine hundred employees of KPM and TNG resigned effective 21 July 2010. Many
were rehired by KMG in the same positions they had held previously. (C-I {{ 220;
C-II { 356). Respondent also does not dispute that many KPM and TNG
employees joined KMG NC on their own volition. (R-II { 713).

On 21 July 2010, the Kazakh Prime Minister, the MOG, and the Aktau Regional
Governor, visited Claimants’ LPG plant to personally carry out the transfer of
ownership. (C-I {[ 218). Claimants characterize this as the expropriation where
they were told that they could either (1) sign an agreement to transfer operations,
(2) become subcontractors, or (3) KMG would obtain a court order and obtain the
business “the hard way.” (C-0 {[ 90- 91). Respondent states that the LPG Plant,
which Claimants abandoned in May 2009, was never part of the property that was
transferred to KMG trust management. It still remains the property of TNG. (R-I |
31.152).

There was a phone call on 22 July 2010 between Mr. Calancea of TNG, Mr.
Ongarbaev of MOG, and Mr. Utilgaliev of KMG in which all issues of the
termination of the contracts and the management of the assets going forward were
discussed. (R-I {31.155 et seq.; R-II 705; CPHB 2 { 178).

Claimants state that the termination notices faxed to KPM and TNG on 22 July
2010 informed both that the territories involved in Contracts 210 and 305 were to
be transferred to the Republic of Kazakhstan and into the temporary possession and
use by KMG. (C-I {| 222; C-II { 354; CPHB 2 {{{[ 74, 117). KPM continued to exist
as a legal entity that could have asserted its legal rights, notwithstanding the
transfer of assets. (R-II { 378, R-I J 31.150).

On 22 July 2010, the MOG sent TNG a notice of termination of Contract 302,
alleging that Contract 302 had expired in March 2009. (CPHB 2 {{ 178).

KMG forwarded Claimants contracts providing for the transfer of infrastructure,
operations, and economic benefits to KMG and the State — contracts that KMG
has already executed. (C-0 { 91; C-I {| 225 — 230). Respondent states that the
terms of the contracts proposed to KPM and TNG in order to transfer the territories
to KMG NC to hold in trust management mirrored the terms of the main trust
agreements signed the day before and provided that the transfer was temporary
until a new subsoil user was found. (R-II {{ 706). Claimants state that they never
signed a transfer agreement with KMG. (C-II {[ 230).

On 22 July 2010, all revenues generated from oil and gas production were put into
a separate escrow account held by KMG. (C-I {| 231; R-I 31.164).

The MOG issued its notification of termination of Contract 302 on 22 July 2010.
(RPHB 1 {{ 347).

On 23 July 2010, KPM and TNG received letters from the MOG stating that, due
to the unilateral termination of the contract from 00 hrs. 00 min. of 22 July 2010 all
products produced on the enterprise had been transferred to the ownership of the
Republic of Kazakhstan. (C-I {[ 232).

On 24 July 2010, Claimants notified the State that it viewed the actions of KMG
and the State as illegal takings of Claimants’ rights and assets, and protested the
revocations and seizures. (C-0 { 91). Respondent confirms this conversation and
points out that there was no one from Claimants left in Kazakhstan to run the
companies. (R-I [ 31.156).

On 28 July 2010, Respondent employed the attorney provisions set out in Article
72(10) of the Subsoil Law and to arrange for an agreement to be entered into for
the transfer of property to KMG. (R-I { 31.160). The transfer of assets was
finalized in Claimants’ absence. (R-II { 712).

Since being taken into trust management, KMG has delegated all immediate
functions for the subsoil area trust management to the Aktau branch of its 100%
affiliate KMT. (R-I J 31.162).

On 26 August 2010, KPM and TNG wrote to the MOG to inquire about the status
of their assets after the cancellation of the three contracts. (C-I {[ 236).

A summons was issued for Mr. Stejar to appear at the transport prosecutor’s office
in or around September 2010. (C-I {| 138).

On 16 September 2010, the 29 December 2009 transfer price tax assessment
decisions were upheld. (C-I {| 174; R-I J 30.65).

On 3 November 2010, the Kazakh Supreme Court overturned the decisions of the
appellate court and the Court of Cassation, thereby reinstating the trial court’s
findings that the corporate income tax assessment was proper. Claimants were
unaware of this review until it was mentioned in the Statement of Defense filed in
this arbitration. (CPHB | {| 255, 258; CPHB 2 { 128; RPHB 2 {| 976).

On 24 January 2011, there was a TV interview of the former President of the
Republic of Moldova. (C-78, minute 1:10:59). Claimants believe that this
interview is an admission that former President Voronin composed the 6 October
2008 letter at the request of President Nazarbayev. (C-I {[ 75). Respondent rejects
this translation of the interview. (R-I 19.21).

On 29 April 2011, KMT obtained a license to operate main pipelines, including
KPM’s 18 km pipeline. (CPHB 2 {| 74).

In August 2011, former Ascom Vice President, Andrei Bastovoi, and his son were
charged with misappropriating USD 185,000 of Ascom funds. Respondent states
that Mr. Bastovoi defended himself by arguing that he was under orders to divert
this funding from Sudan to another African country (Uganda) for corporate
purposes. Respondent states that Mr. Bastovoi was rearrested in October 2011 for
plotting the murder of members of the Stati family. (R-II J 45).

On 17 December 2012, Claimants set up a so-called “Sharing Agreement” between
them and the noteholders. The Sharing Agreement foresees that proceeds from an
award be shared between Claimants and noteholders on a 30/70 basis. (RPHB 1 {L
1056).

As of January 2013, KMT trust manager Mr. Khalelov confirmed that no attempts
have been made to recover allegedly outstanding taxes from KPM or TNG.
(CPHB 2 {{ 128).

Claimants state that, on 14 February 2013, the Sharing Agreement was accepted by
99.8% of the noteholders, effectively amending the notes and related security
arrangements for all noteholders. The Sharing Agreement did not create or
materially alter Claimant’s obligations regarding the Tristan Debt. Instead, it was a
renegotiation of Claimants’ existing obligations and not a voluntary assumption of
new liability. (CPHB 1 {{{[ 626 — 630, 632; CPHB 2 {ff 325 - 327).

F.III. Respondent’s Alleged “Playbook” / Campaign of
Harassment and Interference

The Tribunal has considered all of the facts presented by the Parties, even if not
explicitly stated herein. This section introduces the facts and events related to what
Claimants call Kazakhstan’s “Playbook.” This section is without prejudice to the
Parties’ further submissions and arguments.

1. Arguments by Claimants

Claimants argue that Respondent runs a “playbook” of harassment to coerce
investors and to enrich powerful Kazakhs. The playbook typically commences with
an executive-mandated investigative onslaught and ends with a firesale of assets to
the State or an outright seizure. Groundless tax claims are an important element of
the playbook. Respondent used these harassing and intimidating tactics to coerce
Claimants into selling their investments to KMG at a firesale price and, when that
failed, seized the investments under the appearance of legitimacy. (C-II {| 363;
CPHB 2 {{{[ 40, 128 — 139).

Claimants urge the Tribunal to view Respondent’s conduct for what it was: “a
concerted attempt to coerce Claimants to sell their successful investments to KMG
(or some other company owned by Timur Kulibayev) at a firesale price.” (C-IL J
373). Kazakhstan has a long-standing goal of “claw/ing] back some of the value it
had negotiated away to foreign investors in earlier deals.” (C-IL { 365). It
accomplishes that by “attempting to renegotiate contracts with foreign investors,
and by acquiring interests in foreign-owned companies through KMG at a discount
to fair market value. If foreign investors did not go along voluntarily, Kazakhstan
brought pressure in the form of harassing inspections, outrageous tax assessments,
criminal prosecutions, fines, etc.” (C-I1 § 365). Claimants describe the “playbook”
as follows:

[T]ax authorities and other regulators [in Kazakhstan] have been tasked to
approach investors very aggressively in an effort to address the perceived
unfairness of the deals struck with foreign investors in the republic’s early
years. The Financial Police have apparently been tasked a key role in
implementing government policies designed to reverse these past “errors.”
Using methods similar to those often employed in neighboring Russia, the
Kazakh government has become adept at harassing foreign companies with
a barrage of fines, criminal allegations, and tax threats until it is able to
extract from them whatever concessions it desires. Sometimes the tactics

637.

638.

639.

Page 129 of 414

employed are designed to achieve a material modification of the economic
essence of the transaction. On other occasions their intention seems rather
more confiscatory, geared to driving the foreign investor away and seizing
its investment. (C-II J 365, CPHB 2 { 129).

This “playbook” typically involves three elements. First, there are the Financial
Police. The Financial Police have powers to “preempt, investigate, and prosecute
economic, financial and corruption crimes and violations.” The Financial Police
are closely controlled by President Nazarbayev and act as the “President's
instrument to coordinate multi-agency investigations and to ensure that other more
independent agencies reach the desired conclusions.” (C-II {{ 367). Second, there
is the involvement of the judiciary. While the involvement of the judiciary may
lend the appearance of normalcy and legitimacy to Kazakhstan’s actions, it actually
is just another tool through which the executive branch ensures a predetermined
outcome. Kazakhstan has a weak and partial judiciary. Further, the use of criminal
allegations and prosecutions puts tremendous pressure on investors and greatly
enhances the bargaining position of the State: (C-II {| 367 — 369).

[..] First, it allows for dramatic pressure against individuals, who
recognize that they may be held for protracted periods in investigative
detention and subjected to aggressive interrogation in a country with a
reputation for jailhouse torture and abuse and for ill-explained deaths in
detention, which has no independent judiciary, and in which a conviction is
a foregone conclusion in any case taken to trial. Second, it ratchets up
pressure on those arrested to turn on their employer and provide
information that may lead to the “discovery” of crimes or regulatory
infractions, even when none were legitimately detected before. Criminal
investigators offer immunity for employees who turn on an employer in this
fashion. Third, the disruption produced by the criminal case can paralyze a
business and bring it grinding to a halt. This can occur by distracting
senior management from performing their jobs, through the seizure of
business records which make the continuation of work all but impossible,
through raids and searches of business premises which demoralize
employees and stop work at critical junctures. The prosecution of a
criminal case can thus destroy a business, even if no conviction results. (C-
II ¥ 369).

Third, Kazakhstan invariably makes it clear that the renegotiation of a contract or
the sale of a substantial equity stake to KMG (or another Kazakhstan-owned entity)
will make all these problems go away. This tactic has been used against at least
four other investors in the oil and gas sector to date: (1) Tengizchevroil LLC
(charged with “illegal entrepreneurship” for “unauthorized overproduction” of
oil), (2) Agip KCO (publically accused of fraud), (3) Karachaganak Petroleum
Operating BV (accused, among other things, of “illegal entrepreneurship” for
“profiting from oil output that was not approved by the state”, and (4) Caratube
International Oil Company (repeated raids). (C-II {[ 370).

Claimants state that observers have dubbed Kazakhstan’s political system as an
“advanced kleptocracy or a 21st-century dictatorship” and identify 2 motives for
this. First, President Nazarbayev uses his tactics to enhance personal wealth and
power of himself and his allies. His son-in-law, Timur Kulibayev, who has
amassed a fortune of over USD 1 billion and holds the Chairmanship of KMG and

640.

Page 130 of 414

other positions, is one clear beneficiary of this. He controls an estimated 90% of
the Kazakhstan economy. Second, Kazakhstan uses this “playbook” to weaken
political opponents of President Nazarbayev by eliminating their sources of
income. This motivation seems unlikely here, although Claimants were made
vulnerable by the fact that Anatolie Stati was an adversary of Moldovan President
Voronin. This was a vulnerability because it meant that no Moldovan diplomats
would come to Anatolie Stati’s rescue. (C-II {{[ 371 — 373).

Claimants argue that Respondent used its “playbook” to force Claimants to sell at a
firesale price. Claimants have been refusing offers from companies controlled by
Timur Kulibayev to purchase all or some of their Kazakhstan investments since at
least 2004. In 2004, GazImpex — a company controlled by Mr. Kulibayev —
attempted to purchase TNG. At the time, Claimants valued TNG at USD 567
million, but GazImpex valued TNG at USD 27.8 — 32.9 million. This was likely
Mr. Kulibayev’s first attempt to acquire Claimants’ investments at a bargain price.
In 2007, Claimants discussed the sale of TNG to another company controlled by
Mr. Kulibayey — KazRosGas — a joint venture between KMG and Gazprom.
KazRosGas wanted to purchase a 50% interest in TNG. But, when Terra Raf
determined that selling a share in TNG of that size could trigger Kazakhstan’s pre-
emptive right to acquire the interest, it decided not to sell the partial stake to
anyone. The message was that Claimants did not want to be in business with the
Kazakhstan government (i.e., KMG). (C-II {{[ 373 — 376).

In summer 2008, Claimants marketed the 100% sale of their investments through
Project Zenith. They included KMG in the potential purchaser targets, since they
would not be in business with the buyer thereafter. Renaissance Capital sent KMG
the Information Memorandum and the Due Diligence presentation, both of which
contained substantial details about the companies and their assets. On 25
September 2008, KPM submitted an offer of USD 754 million, for KPM and TNG
(minus the Contract 302 properties). This was the third lowest offer. Less than
three weeks later, however, President Nazarbayev issued his order to investigate
Claimants’ companies, resulting in a “barrage of investigations, false accusations,
exorbitant tax assessments, and criminal prosecutions.” Claimants argue that the
“timing alone supports a strong inference that President Nazarbayev issued his
order to help tip the scales in KazMunaiGaz’s favor in the Project Zenith. The
events that unfolded over the next 20 months make that inference extremely clear.”
(C-II { 376 — 380). In particular, Claimants highlight the following events:

. On November 11, 2008, the Financial Police’s issuance of a finding that
KPM did not have a main pipeline license, paving the way for the criminal
trial and US$ 145 million fine on KPM;

. On December 18, 2008, the MEMR’s reversal of its pre-emptive rights
waiver as to TNG, and issuance of a press release alleging forgery and

fraud in connection with the registration of TNG;

. On February 10, 2009, the assessment of US$ 62 million in back taxes,
disregarding stabilization guarantees in its Subsoil Use Contracts; and

. On April 29, 2009, the arrest of KPM’s general director. (C-II J 380).

642. This harassment campaign caused a liquidity crisis within Claimants’ companies
that, combined with falling energy prices, forced Claimants to obtain a bridge loan
for additional working capital. Claimants had already finalized the details of a loan
from Credit Suisse on 5 December 2008, but Credit Suisse — after seeing the 18
December 2008 press release and accusations — refused to provide the capital until
Claimants resolved their disputes with Respondent. (C-II § 381). Claimants’
description of its additional liquidity problems are best taken from their own
words:

382. Without that additional working capital, KPM and TNG’s cash position
became very tight in early 2009. Moreover, Kazakhstan exacerbated that
liquidity problem by choking off TNG’s access to gas markets. In the fall
of 2008, TNG’s largest non-local customer — Kemikal, a company
controlled by Mr. Kulibayev — inexplicably failed to post bank guarantees
that were part of its required payment terms. Because Kemikal had an
erratic payment history, TNG chose not to renew that contract without the
bank guarantees in place (and in fact, ended up pursuing Kemikal until
June of 2009 to acquire the last of Kemikal’s overdue payments). When
local demand declined in the spring of 2009, however, the absence of the
Kemikal contract left TNG with a shortage of demand. TNG approached
KazRosGas about purchasing its excess gas for export, but KazRosGas
never responded. _ TNG had previously sold gas for export through
KazRosGas and GasImpex (both companies that were controlled by Mr.
Kulibayev), and those companies had made a substantial profit on those
contracts. Thus, the decision of KazRosGas not to export TNG’s gas in
the spring of 2009 seems suspiciously like a conscious attempt to choke off
TNG’s revenues at a critical time.

383. This liquidity crisis reached its peak in June 2009, when KPM and TNG
owed significant tax payments as well as loan repayments to Tristan
needed to fund Tristan’s coupon payments to noteholders. Not
coincidently, KazMunaiGaz returned at exactly that time to make another
lowball offer for the companies. KazMunaiGaz knew the predicament that
KPM and TNG were in. As a result of the “re-evaluation” of TNG that the
MEMR ordered in March, KazMunaiGaz received access to the complete
Project Zenith data room — including KPM and TNG financials — in
April 2009. Then, in June 2009, KazMunaiGaz offered only US$ 50
million for Claimants’ equity interests and indicated that it would “deal
separately” with the companies’ debts, without providing any further
detail. Even assuming that KazMunaiGaz intended to pay face value for
the US$ 550 million in outstanding debt (which seems unlikely, based on
KazMunaiGaz’s offer of 25 cents on the dollar to the Tristan noteholders
in November 2009), the total value of [KMG’s] “offer” had decreased to
at most US$ 600 million — which was at least US$ 150 million less than
its indicative offer from September 2008. It is no coincidence that
KazMunaiGaz showed up with this opportunistic offer at just the right
time. This is the Kazakhstan harassment playbook at work.

384. Claimants were only able to weather the liquidity storm in the summer of
2009 by obtaining emergency bridge financing from a group of venture
capitalists (the “Laren Facility”). The terms of the Laren Facility were

terrible for Claimants (35% interest on a $60 million note, plus the
issuance of $111 million of new Tristan notes). Because of the substantial
risks to lenders created by Kazakhstan’s harassment campaign, those were
the best terms that Claimants could obtain. They had no choice but to
accept those terms while they continued to try to sell the companies to
Total and KNOC in the summer of 2009. (C-I {{ 382 — 384).

As time continued, Respondent simply turned up the pressure. Kazakhstan
interfered in the trial of Mr. Cornegruta to ensure a guilty verdict and then
sentenced him to four years’ incarceration in a notoriously dangerous prison
system. Kazakhstan then threatened to do the same to KPM and TNG’s other
directors. Kazakhstan levied a massive fine against KPM that was large enough to
bankrupt the company and provide a ground for seizing the assets. Through the
continued inspections, audits, and seizures, Kazakhstan continued to interfere with
the day-to-day operations of the business. Then, in November 2009, KMG made
another, even lower bid to buy the companies. (C-II ff 385 — 386).

At around the same time, Mr. Kulibayev clandestinely made another attempt to
purchase the companies, through a different company: the Starleigh Group. (C-II {|
387).

On 7 February 2010, the President of the Blagovest Fund, Mr. Zakharov, wrote a
letter to the MEMR. (C-I {ff 15, 181-2, CPHB 1 {{ 335, CPHB 2 {f 38).
Accompanying this Blagovest letter was a 19 November 2009 personal instruction
from President Nazarbayev, which Claimants state indicates that he had wanted to
strip the companies of their assets while maintaining the assets operational. This
letter and the attached government instruction indicates that Kazakhstan planned a
take over as early as 2008. (C-I[ 182; CPHB | {{{[ 335 — 341).

Despite the campaign of harassment, Claimants were able to find a buyer for KPM
and TNG in February 2010 — the Cliffson Company. The total value of this offer
exceeded USD 920 million. On 12 April 2010, Claimants submitted applications
for approval of the Cliffson sale and a waiver of Kazakhstan’s pre-emptive rights.
On 30 April 2010 and 1 June 2010, the MOG requested additional information
about the transaction and Claimants provided all of the reasonably requested
information on 23 June 2010. Rather than respond, however, Kazakhstan initiated
the final inspection blitz that led to the ultimate expropriation of Claimants’ assets
on 22 July 2010. (C-II {{[ 388 — 391, partially quoted).

Claimants state that, by this time, they had made it clear that they intended to bring
arbitration claims against Kazakhstan for the diminution in value of their
investments once the Cliffson sale closed. This had been an issue of concern
throughout the harassment campaign. Even the MEMR’s 28 September 2009 letter
to the Ministry of Industry and Trade noted that the risk of arbitration was one of
the reasons why it would be better to obtain KPM and TNG through acquisition
rather than premature termination of the Subsoil Use Contracts. (C-II ff 392 - 394,
partially quoted).

In addition to completely interfering with Claimants’ ability to use, manage, and
enjoy their investments, Kazakhstan’s conduct made it impossible for Claimants to
sell their companies, as they had planned to do starting in mid-2008. Claimants do
not contend that Kazakhstan’s actions motivated their initial decision to sell. What

Page 133 of 414

is important, however, is that none of the interested bidders was willing to follow
through with the sale after Kazakhstan commenced its targeted harassment of KPM
and TNG in October 2008. (C-II {{] 396 - 397).

In response to Kazakhstan’s argument that “the majority of potential bidders
decided not to make a bid for reasons unrelated to governmental harassment or
interference, such as the global economic crisis, perceived lack of transport links,
and other reasons outlined in a presentation by Renaissance Capital to
Claimants”, Claimants point out that all of these factors existed in September 2008,
well before the campaign of harassment began. Despite all of these factors, eight
bidders showed serious interest in Claimants’ investments. (C-II {| 398).

In response to Kazakhstan’s argument that Claimants provided bidders inaccurate
or incomplete information masking the illegalities of their purchase of KPM and
TNG, Claimants state that there were no such facts to disclose. Claimants’
acquisition and reorganization of KPM and TNG were legal, and the companies
had valid licenses for all the activities they conducted. It was not until Kazakhstan
retroactively reversed its waiver of pre-emptive rights and publicized allegations of
fraud in December 2008 (as part of this harassment campaign) that there was ever
any question about the legal status of Claimants’ investments.

With respect to the five bidders who chose not to go forward, Claimants state that
some change in circumstances having nothing to do with the data room (which they
did not see), must have caused them to lose interest in the investments. The two
events that occurred between the bidding and their decision not to participate were
(1) Kazakhstan’s retroactive reversal of its waiver of pre-emptive rights with
respect to Terra Raf’s purchase of TNG and (2) Kazakhstan’s assessment of USD
62 million in alleged back taxes and penalties, in blatant disregard of the
stabilization guarantees in the Subsoil Use Contracts. With respect to the two
bidders who chose not to continue after seeing the data room, their exit does not
cast any doubt on the accuracy of information provided to bidders in the first phase
of Project Zenith or on the reliability of those indicative offers. Instead, Claimants
state that “it is possible that these two potential bidders withdrew from Project
Zenith after learning of Kazakhstan’s allegations of such illegalities, which
Kazakhstan publicized in a press release on 18 December 2008. But since those
allegations were wholly unfounded and a part of Kazakhstan's targeted
harassment campaign, this possibility only supports Claimants’ position that the
harassment campaign had its intended effect of deterring potential bidders for
Claimants’ investments.” (C-II {| 401 — 402).

The final two bidders, Total and KNOC, withdrew only after speaking with Kazakh
authorities. These companies likely knew about the ongoing harassment and its
effect on KPM and TNG. Total has been understandably quiet and diplomatic
about its real reasons not to pursue acquisition of KPM and TNG, as it is already
involved in long-standing joint activities with KMG in Kazakhstan. This
ownership and management structure insulates Total from the kind of harassment
that Claimants have experienced, harassment which Total as a 100% disfavored
foreign owner could also experience. KNOC would not proceed without speaking
to Kazakh authorities. Respondent has not presented any witnesses to dispute that
its personnel met with representatives of Total and KNOC and persuaded them not
to acquire TNG and KPM. The letters that have been provided should be

Page 134 of 414

disregarded unless their authors are presented for cross-examination. The
authenticity of these letters is in question, as they were plainly solicited by
Kazakhstan for this arbitration. In addition, the four companies that purportedly
wrote the letters (R-41, 41.2, 41.4) continue to have significant investments in
Kazakhstan (C-II {{{ 403 - 407).

Claimants state that the letter from KMG demonstrates how Kazakhstan’s
harassment campaign undermined the alienability of Claimants’ investments. Of
the six factors it states it discovered in the data room in March 2009, two were
inaccurate and four were the direct result of Respondent’s harassment campaign —
and none were from any declines in KPM’s and TNG’s intrinsic worth. (C-II {I
407 — 410).

409. [...] As described above, the US$ 60 million Laren loan (issue 2), and the
issuance of US$ 111.1 million in additional Tristan notes in connection
with that loan (issue 4), were only necessary because of Kazakhstan’s
harassment campaign. Moreover, the third issue referenced by
KazMunaiGaz — the “other risks related to claims from Kazakhstan's
government authorities” — refers presumably to the tax, duty, and
criminal fine liabilities imposed wrongly on KPM and TNG as part of
Respondent’s harassment campaign. Additionally, the final factor
mentioned by KazMunaiGaz — Claimants’ removal of Casco fiom the field
in 2009 — resulted directly from Kazakhstan’s harassment campaign.
Because of the cash flow shortfall discussed above, and the increasingly
hostile investment environment, Claimants prudently reduced their drilling
and workover activities in Kazakhstan and removed Casco personnel from
the country. (C-I J 409).

Turning to Respondent’s dismissal of the effect that its actions had on KNOC,
Total, and other Phase 2 Project Zenith companies, Claimants remind the Tribunal
that, prior to the Aktau City Court’s issuance of the USD 145 fine on 18 September
2009, Kazakhstan had (1) retroactively reversed its waiver of pre-emptive rights
with respect to Terra Raf’s acquisition of TNG and publicly accused Claimants of
fraud and forgery; (2) assessed millions of dollars in back taxes, blatantly
disregarding its contractual stabilization guarantees; and (3) jailed KPM’s general
director on charges that could be leveled against most oil and gas producers in
Kazakhstan. Each of these events was significant enough to deter foreign
investors, making the timing of the bidder’s withdrawals (prior to the fine
assessment) less relevant. (C-II Jf 412 — 414).

The KMG and Starleigh offers were significantly below FMV — not only because
they valued equity at USD 50 million and because they promised to “deal
separately” with the companies’ debts — but because they were attempting to take
advantage of Claimants’ weakened position caused by Kazakhstan’s harassment
campaign. In light of the harassment, and with the knowledge that, because of it,
Claimants were desperate to sell and that Kazakhstan could obtain the investments
for KMG through expropriation, neither KMG nor Starleigh had any incentive to
offer FMV for Claimants’ investments. (C-II {{{[ 415 — 417).

The Cliffson offer, which was for USD 267 million for all equity interests in TNG,
KPM, and Tristan and for assumption of all of those companies’ liabilities, was
valued at USD 920 million. This offer was below the FMV because of the pressure

to sell, caused by Respondent’s harassment campaign. Cliffson even indicated
during negotiations that it was the only company that Kazakhstan would permit to
purchase TNG and KPM. (C-II {ff 418 - 422).

2. Arguments by Respondent

In its Post Hearing Briefs, Respondent explained:

(a)

(b)
(c)

(d)

that there was nothing improper about President Nazarbayev’s
instructions based upon President Voronin’s letter; [Indeed, to not
investigate would have been an affront from a foreign policy perspective.
(RPHB 2 { 375)]

that no motive for harassment — be it political or financial — existed; and

that the Blagovest letter about which Claimants try to create a lot of
confusion does not support their theories in any way;

that no “Playbook” exists and that the Financial Police and other
authorities as well as the Kazakh courts acted independently and not as the
extended arm of the executive. (RPHB 1 {Jf 371 — 373, partially quoted;
RPHB 2 { 375 et seq.).

Respondent’s arguments with respect to Claimants’ “Playbook” theory are best
taken from their own words:

244.

245.

Claimants’ account of the “Kazakhstan Playbook” is nothing more than a
fairytale. There is no “Kazakhstan Playbook” and certainly no campaign
to. expropriate Claimants’ investments by using these so-called
“Playbook” tactics. [...] Claimants’ Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction and
Liability provides no evidence of a planned nor a concerted harassment of
Claimants’ business by the Republic or any person or entity associated
with the Republic. Instead, the Republic legitimately investigated
Claimants, uncovering substantial legal and contractual violations,
ultimately leading to a rightful and lawful termination of the Contracts.
Any conspiracy theory which Claimants concoct cannot circumvent these
facts.

Claimants’ “Playbook” theory is completely unsubstantiated and wholly
dependent on defamatory opinions of the Republic’s oil and gas industry.
Claimants fail to provide any factual evidence to support the existence or
operation of a “Playbook”. Notwithstanding this, Claimants still draw the
most inconceivable conclusions to fabricate their conspiracy. The expert
report they largely rely on from Scott Horton does not assist them in this
regard. Notwithstanding this, Claimants still deem it appropriate to make
ludicrous comments about the Republic, including describing its political
system as an “advanced kleptocracy or a 21st-century dictatorship”. These
statements are not only irrelevant and inappropriate but also
fundamentally incorrect.

659.

660.

661.

Page 136 of 414

246. The “Playbook” theory itself hinges on a misguided belief that the
Republic harasses foreign investors by “inspections, outrageous tax
assessments, criminal prosecutions, fines, etc” using the Financial Police
and the Kazakh courts and through coercing the investors to renegotiate
their contracts, to “make all these problems go away”. Claimants state
that the motives for the Republic’s “conduct” are to enhance President
Nazarbaev’s “personal wealth and power of himself and his allies”
including Timur Kulibayev and to “weaken political opponents of
President Nazarbayev by eliminating their sources of income”. For the
reasons set out below, each of these alleged tactics of harassment
employed and motives for doing so are completely unfounded.
Furthermore, the farcical manner in which Claimants seek to associate
this theory with the very legitimate action taken by the Republic against
them is completely misleading. Although Claimants’ various legal and
contractual violations will be addressed in other parts of this Rejoinder
Memorial on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal should not, in any
event, be persuaded that this “Kazakhstan Playbook” that Claimants have
concocted exists. (R-II {] 244 — 246; RPHB | {] 409 — 413).

Claimants completely mischaracterize the purpose and role of the Financial Police.
The Financial Police are obliged by law to investigate and prosecute financial
crimes. This includes carrying out investigations of subsoil users having
potentially committed such offenses. They do not set out to harass foreign
investors. The Financial Police has become an accountable agency. It is headed by
professional security officials and is independent from the executive. Claimants
have provided no evidence for their contention that the Financial Police act as
President Nazarbayev’s instrument. (R-II {{ 247 - 249).

   

Closer examination reveals that Claimants were not subject to a barrage of
seemingly random inspections, but rather were subject to two principle phases of
inspection, each initiated for unconnected reasons by different organizations for
different purposes. In each case, the outcome was different. The first phase of
inspections took place from October — November 2008 in response to the concerns
of President Nazarbayev in light of the letter from President Voronin of Moldova.
The purpose of these investigations was to determine whether there was any truth
in President Voronin’s allegations. The result of this first phase of inspections was
the criminal prosecution of Mr. Cornegruta for illegal entrepreneurial activity and a
number of assessments of taxes and duties. The inspections that took place
between November 2008 and July 2010 were principally a continuation of
processes set in motion in October and November 2008 and share the justification
and objective of those initial inspections. The second phase of inspections was
initiated by the GPO in June and July 2010 in response to complaints that KPM
and TNG were not fulfilling their obligations to employees and were failing to
comply with legislation and their Subsoil Use Contracts. This second phase
discovered a string of infringements that ultimately led the MEMR to terminate
KPM and TNG’s Subsoil Use Contracts, prior to transferring the companies’
subsoil assets into trust management. (R-II {J 247, 280 — 285; RPHB 2 {{{[ 375 —
382).

Subsoil users are always subject to a high level of scrutiny, which is simply a
feature of the subsoil industry. Claimants were aware of this high level of scrutiny.
It was expressly disclosed in their contracts and licenses, which contain ongoing

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 138 of 415

662.

663.

664.

Page 137 of 414

disclosure and record maintenance obligations and even reference legislative rights
of inspection and audit contained in law. KPM and TNG were not subject to any
greater degree of scrutiny than were any other subsoil users. To the contrary, from
2001 to 2010, KPM was inspected 88 times, TNG was inspected 100 times while
other companies were inspected more: Karazhanbasmunai was inspected 246
times, Mangistaumunaigaz 298 times, Uzenmunaygaz 390 times, and Emir Oil 76
times. Considering the statistics for subsoil users in Mangystau Province, such as
KPM and TNG, for the period of 2001 — 2010, KPM and TNG were the second and
third least audited companies, with the state company Uzemunaigaz being the most
audited. (R-I J 20.29 — 20.31; R-II {Jf 286 - 291).

The criminal inspections of KPM and TNG were, of course, outside of the scope of
the routine inspections, but were nonetheless justified and lawful. These
inspections were motivated by allegations of criminal behavior. The results of
these inspections were reviewed by a separate department of the Financial Police —
independent from the individuals who had undertaken the inspections — before any
decision was taken as to whether to proceed. Review confirmed that there was
sufficient evidence that a crime had been committed in some respects, but that
there was insufficient evidence to pursue criminal investigation of other findings.
Those investigations were terminated. (R-II {{{[ 292 — 297).

The continuation into 2009 of the initial inspection was a structured attempt to
gather evidence to develop the case — it was not “an unguided capricious exercise
of power.” These investigations were far from sinister or threatening. Employees
at KPM and TNG’s premises were helpful. The Financial Police conducted the
searches while unarmed (KPM and TNG’s security forces were armed) and while
outnumbered by KPM and TNG’s security forces. Respondent describes steps
undertaken to help KPM and TNG employees feel at ease throughout the search,
especially since by that time they knew that Mr. Cornegruta had been arrested.
Claimants’ descriptions to the contrary are wildly exaggerated. (R-II {{{] 298 —
302).

The second round of inspections (June/July 2010) was initiated by the GPO in
response to complaints that KPM and TNG had infringed the rights of their
employees and had breached a number of contractual and legislative obligations.
The complaints included allegations related to non-payment of salaries, mass
dismissal of employees, failure to comply with environmental legislation, and
failure to comply with subsoil use legislation. The investigation had nothing to do
with the introduction of new subsoil legislation. Each agency that participated in
this complex/comprehensive audit was specifically instructed based on its
particular expertise. A complex audit was found to be more appropriate and less
intrusive than a “drip, drip” of inspections to address the issues raised in the
complaint. These inspections were led by the GPO and revealed a number of
infringements by KPM and TNG. The Ministry of Environment Protection, the
MOG, the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies, the Ministry of Labor and
Social Protection, the MES, and the Sanitary and Epidemiological Inspection
authorities found extensive violations. No contemporaneous complaint was
received in relation to the conduct of the complex investigation. Claimants’
statements that this was a “final inspection blitz” or that this was somehow the
culmination of a campaign of harassment by the Republic are unfounded. (R-II {if
305 — 310, 317 - 320).

665.

667.

668.

Page 138 of 414

The results of the GPO inspections were not required to be recorded in an Act of
Inspection. In response to Claimants’ complaint that the Acts of Inspection were
received too late to avoid termination of the contracts, Respondent notes the
following:

(a) The issue of operating a main pipeline without a license, referred to in the
MEMR'’s letters of 14 July 2010, had been known to the companies since at
least 18 September 2009 when Mr Cornegruta was convicted of the offence
of illegal entrepreneurial activity. Therefore ample time had been
available to respond to the allegation;

(b) The issue of non payment of taxes, also referred to in the MEMR’s letters,
had been known about since at least 8 and 9 September 2009 when the
Astana City Court ruled against their challenge to the Tax Committee’s
assessment of corporate back taxes;

(c) Claimants admit that they received the MEMR’s Act of Acceptance several
days prior to the 19 July 2010 deadline set by the MEMR to reply to its
notices of breach and sufficiently in advance for Mr Calancea to conclude
that “Kazakhstan’s allegations were essentially groundless” and for KPM
and TNG to each provide 5 to 6 page responses to the MEMR’s notices.
(R-II YY 311 — 312; see also RPHB 2 {J 339 - 374).

Given the nature of the infringements discovered, it was proper for the MEMR to
address the breaches to the Subsoil Use Contracts.

Claimants’ allegation that Kazakh courts are dominated by the executive is quite
simply wrong, though western observers have not sufficiently noted the major steps
that have been undertaken in recent years to reform the judiciary. Kazakhstan’s
constitution expressly refers to the independence of the judiciary and to the
separation of powers between the executive legislature and the judiciary.
Claimants have provided no evidence that the executive in any way controlled or
influenced the courts as part of the alleged harassment of KPM and TNG. The
Republic’s position is that there is nothing incorrect or improper about the Aktau
Court’s decision to prosecute Mr. Cornegruta for illegal entrepreneurship. The
decision was valid, correct, and was confirmed on appeal. (R-II {{{[ 250 — 254, 495
— 627).

As the backdrop to the “playbook” argument, Claimants argue that the Republic
made it clear that “renegotiation of a contract or the sale of a substantial equity
stake to KMG (or another Kazakhstan-owned entity) will make these problems go
away.” First, there is nothing untoward with the Republic legitimately re-
negotiating Subsoil Use Contracts and/or national companies acquiring interests in
companies that had rights to exploit its subsoil. It certainly cannot be seen as part
of some “Playbook” conspiracy against foreign investors. Instead, Respondent
shows that the examples provided by Claimants involved companies that had very
serious problems and had violated the terms of their contracts and Kazakh law,
making contractual renegotiation and/or state assistance necessary. Second, there
was likewise nothing untoward about the bids for TNG and/or KPM made by
companies supposedly associated with the Republic or with Mr. Kulibayev. None
of these bids confirm any alleged “playbook.” Third, even if the Republic were to
try to renegotiate contracts made in the 1990s which it believed to be too generous,

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 140 of 415

669.

671.

672.

Page 139 of 414

there is nothing untoward about such action and it certainly is not part of any
conspiracy against foreign investors. (R-II {{[ 255 — 260, 270 — 271).

Claimants’ arguments that the Republic and Mr. Kulibayev wrongfully tried to
acquire KPM and TNG is nothing more than a fanciful attempt to frame what was a
rightful termination of the contracts and transfer of contractual territories into trust
management as some sort of fictional conspiracy theory against them. With
respect to Claimants’ arguments that GazImpex, KazRosGas, and Starleigh have
attempted to purchase KPM and TNG, Claimants have failed to prove that Mr.
Kulibayev owned or controlled any of these companies. (R-II {{[ 338 — 342; RPHB
2 375).

The 2004 GazImpex offer for TNG is irrelevant to this arbitration. Those
negotiations fell apart when GazImpex did not value the company as highly as
Claimants did. The 2007 offer by KazRosGaz is also irrelevant, and there were no
official proposals or negotiations. There is no connection to the Republic and there
is nothing coercive about one company bidding for another. (R-II {{{[ 343 — 345).

The Starleigh offer is also irrelevant, as Claimants have not proven that Mr.
Kulibayev is linked to the company or, even if he is, if Starleigh is linked to the
Kazakh government or if Starleigh was involved in any conspiracy against
Claimants. Claimants’ argument also makes little sense. Respondent hypothesizes
“if Starleigh genuinely believed it could somehow obtain KPM and TNG for no
money at all, it surely would not have made the very substantial bid it did at the
time, which included dealing with the debt Claimants had amassed, which
amounted to more than US$500m.” (R-II {{[ 346 — 349, partially quoted).

With respect to the bids made by KMG EP and KMG NC, Respondent explains
that these two distinct companies, which Claimants refer to misleadingly as KMG,
made very different bids for KPM and TNG at very different stages. Claimants
have provided no evidence that Mr. Kulibayev was the Chairman of KMG EP. Mr.
Kulibayev was only the Chairman of KMG NC ~ a state entity that considers the
social and economic implications of an acquisition. Mr. Kulibayev had no control
over KMG EP and Claimants have provided no evidence that he had any role in
KMG EP or KMG NC’s bids for KPM and TNG, or that he was in any way
influencing the Republic to coerce Claimants into selling KPM and TNG to KMG
NC. Furthermore, a sale to KMG NC would not lead to a change in Mr.
Kulibayev’s wealth, as KMG NC is a state owned company. Finally, it is clear
from the facts that neither KMG EP nor KMG NC were part of any alleged attempt
by the Republic to force Claimants to sell KPM and TNG to entities allegedly
owned or controlled by Mr. Kulibayev. In fact, KMG EP only bid on Claimants’
companies after being invited to do so by Claimants themselves. Thereafter,
Claimants invited KMG EP to participate in the second phase of Project Zenith —
again, undermining the argument that the Republic was coercing it to sell to KMG
EP. The bid was made based on information made available by Claimants — the
bid was certainly not a form of harassment. KMG EP withdrew in July 2009 after
deciding that it was not commercially reasonable to purchase the assets. KMG NC,
on the other hand, only expressed an interest in purchasing TNG and KPM in
November 2009, in order to play a “white knight” role in resolving the issues that
Claimants had caused to its assets. (R-II {| 350 — 361, partially quoted).

Respondent explains that the motives that Claimants describe for the Republic to
use a “Playbook” are entirely fictional. Turning first to the alleged motive of
enhancing Timur Kulibayev’s power and wealth, Respondent explains that Mr.
Kulibayev is far from the omnipotent figure in the Kazakh regime that Claimants
describe. Prof. Olcott explained that he had recently been dismissed from his
position at Samruk-Kazyna. His role as a state servant in KMG NC is different and
distinct from his separate business interests. In any event, Claimants have provided
nothing beyond conjecture to support their argument that the Republic was trying
to coerce them into selling to entities owned or controlled by Mr. Kulibayev. (R-II
(SI 261 — 264; RPHB 1 {J 384 — 385, 389 - 391; RPHB 2 {{ 375).

Claimants have also failed to demonstrate that Mr. Kulibayev or any of the
companies controlled by him was interested in acquiring KPM and TNG. With
respect to KazRosGas, that is a Russian-Kazakh joint venture that is only 50%
controlled by Kazakhstan. Accordingly, it is impossible that Mr. Kulibayev
controls the company. Regarding GazImpex and Kemikal, Prof. Olcott was unable
to find any proof that Mr. Kulibayev owned the companies. Claimants also lack
evidence regarding Starleigh, and did not even mention it in the hearings in
October 2012 or January 2013, making it likely that they have abandoned those
contentions. Claimants’ first allegation that KazAzot was controlled by Mr.
Kulibayev was made at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability. That allegation
was denied by Minister Mynbayev. (RPHB 1 {| 392 — 397; RPHB 2 {{ 375).

Kemikal did not “inexplicably” stop payment — Kemikal’s “liquidity and
insolvency” issues were the reason that Kemikal stopped making payments. The
loss of Kemikal as a customer is not attributable to Respondent. (RPHB 2 {{ 124).

With respect to governmental motives, Claimants rely on internal government
correspondence, which they deliberately misinterpret. The correspondence
confirms that government officials were worried about the social situation in the
region. In particular, the letter from the Mangystau Governor Kusherbayev of
August 2009 in no way proposes an expropriation. Instead, the idea of purchasing
the assets was only considered as one method to address the problems surrounding
the companies. (RPHB | {{{[ 398 — 403).

Turning to the alleged political motives, Respondent states that Claimants have
failed to provide any evidence to support their bold assertion that “Kazakhstan

frequently uses this harassment playbook to weaken political opponents of

President Nazarbayev by eliminating their sources of income.” Claimants’ own
admission that Anatolie Stati is not a political opponent of President Nazarbayev,
however, makes their attempts to twist the political dynamic to make it applicable
to him is, at best, fanciful. That President Voronin of Moldova saw Anatolie Stati
as an adversary is wholly irrelevant. The letter from President Voronin did not
attempt to paint Anatolie Stati as an irresistible target, but was instead simply the
kind of letter that required some sort of follow up.

To the extent that Claimants argue that the letter from President Voronin is proof of
a campaign against Claimants, their argument fails for several reasons. First, the
letter is a pro-forma document with which a complaint by one head of state is
forwarded to competent authorities. Second, this letter received special attention
because it was from another CIS head of state. Third, given post-soviet alliances, it

679.

680.

681.

682.

Page 141 of 414

would be likely that President Nazarbayev would take the side of Anatolie Stati,
rather than the side of President Voronin, due to their political connections prior to
independence. Fourth, the letter accused Anatolie Stati of concealing profits from
the states where those profits were being made, meaning potentially that taxes were
being withheld from the Republic. Against this background, it would have been
careless for President Nazarbayev not to inspect. The authorities indeed inspected
the tax payments, and given the grave charges made by President Voronin, there
was no reason to limit the inspections to taxes. The inspections turned up
violations and the Financial Police were free to rely on other aspects proven by the
inspections to open criminal investigations. Claimants are, therefore, incorrect
when they argue that the accusations in President Voronin’s letter were not
investigated — they were, including the accusations of concealing profits from state
authorities. Claimants attempt to use this “playbook” argument to district the
Tribunal from this fact. (R-II {J 265 — 279; RPHB 1 {{{[ 377 — 382; RPHB 2 {[ 381).

Regarding Claimants’ allegations of financial or strategic motives, Respondent also
states the KPM and TNG were uninteresting targets with an equity value of 0 and
an enterprise value of USD 186 as of 21 July 2010. (RPHB 1 {{{[ 387).

Regarding the so-called Blagovest letter, that letter was from a private organization
written on its own initiative. Claimants state that the Blagovest letter was written
by Mr. Zakharov on the initiative of Mr. Andreyev, then-general director of KPM.
The obscure circumstances surrounding this letter stem from the obscure action of
KPM’s general director at the time. There is no proof of any connection between
the Republic and Mr. Zakharov, President of the Blagovest Fund. Testimony at the
Hearing also demonstrated that Mr. Zakharov was “far removed from the facts of
real life.’ Allegations of a plan to expropriate cannot be based on his letter.
(RPHB | {{{[ 404 — 408; RPHB 2 {{ 372, 381, 382).

Respondent explains that the Blagovest Fund is a non-commercial and non-
governmental organization in Kazakhstan. It is a social foundation (i.e. a private
entity that serves a specific public interest). (R-I {| 19.27; R-II {| 335). The
Blagovest Foundation applied to the MEMR to assist in solving problematic issues
connected with KPM and TNG. (R-I {[ 19.27). The director of Blagovest was a
former director of KPM. (R-I {[ 19.32). Mr. Zakharov, who had been approached
by then-general director of KPM, believed himself able to mediate the dispute, in
part because of the similar religious missions of the Blagovest Fund — a Cossack
charitable fund — and the Stati family. Mr. Zakharov, however, refused to appear
to be examined at the Hearings. (R-II {{ 336; RPHB 2 {[ 375, 381). Respondent
confirms that an internal government instruction, which was not supposed to be
seen by or disclosed to the public, was attached to the Blagovest letter. Respondent
states that it is very likely that KPM obtained this document through bribery or
otherwise by corrupting Kazakh officials. (R-II { 213).

 

Claimants’ argument that all Kazakh authorities — except the MEMR, which tried
to defend Claimants — conspired against Claimants contradicts its previous
allegations that the MEMR fabricated the pre-emptive rights waiver issue in
December 2008 to harass TNG. Claimants’ construction of Minister Mynbayev’s
testimony that MEMR defended KPM and TNG “against the other Kazakh
authorities involved, in an effort to protect from a unilateral takeover” is simply
not in the transcript. Nor is the alleged statement that President Nazarbayev’s

instruction of November 2009 was a starting point for the MEMR’s alleged “work”
to terminate KPM and TNG’s Subsoil Use Contracts. (RPHB 2 {{ 377, 380).
Claimants have also failed to respond to the Republic’s arguments that no motive
for the alleged harassment exists. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 377 — 378).

Summary of Contentions by Claimants

Claimants’ contentions are taken from their own words, without prejudice to their
further arguments:

6.

Kazakhstan does not have — and never did have — any credible
jurisdictional objections. Claimants are indisputably “Investors” who
made qualifying “Investments” protected by the ECT.

[...] According to Kazakhstan's own figures, between 2000 and 2009,
Claimants invested US $473 million in KPM and US $693 million in TNG,
a total in excess of US $1.1 billion [and] paid over US $350 million in tax
revenues to the Kazakh State. KPM and TNG permanently employed nearly
1,000 Kazakh workers, and TNG employed some 3,000 additional contract
workers to construct the LPG Plant.

Claimants’ substantial investments transformed the previously fallow
Borankol and Tolkyn fields into significant producers of oil, gas, and
condensate. By 2010, Claimants had over 70 operational wells in the
Borankol field and a total of 40 wells in the Tolkyn field and Contract 302
area. As of 2008, Claimants had produced 12 million barrels of oil and
condensate (“MBbls”) and 22 billion cubic feet (“bcf”) of gas from the
Borankol field, and 11 MBbls oil and condensate and 246 bef of gas from
the Tolkyn field. As a result of Claimants’ investments, TNG became the
fourth largest gas producer in Kazakhstan.

Claimants also invested more than US $240 million in construction of an
LPG Plant, which was substantially complete before construction was
halted as a result of the State’s misconduct. Kazakhstan viewed the LPG
Plant as a “strategic asset” for the Mangystau region. Claimants also
conducted extensive exploration and production work on TNG’s Contract
302 Properties, including drilling the “Munaibay 1” well, shooting 3D
seismic, and acquiring a deep drilling rig to explore the considerable
“Interoil Reef” prospect.

[...] [P]rior to President Nazarbayev’s directive of October 14, 2008,
Claimants and their companies had enjoyed eight years of positive,
productive relations with the Kazakh Government. That changed abruptly
in the weeks following President Nazarbayev’s personal instruction to
“thoroughly check” KPM and TNG. During the previous eight years,
however, Kazakh agencies had routinely inspected and audited the

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 144 of 415

20.

Page 143 of 414

companies’ operations and accounts and had consistently given them
“clean bills of health.”

Notably, there had never been any allegation that KPM’s or TNG’s field
pipelines were “main” pipelines, because they obviously were not. And
Kazakhstan had taken express positions on other issues that it would
directly contradict after October 2008 (and in this case). A simple review
of Kazakhstan’s change of position before and after October 14, 2008,
demonstrates that President Nazarbayev’s order caused the harm
Claimants suffered in this case.

[...] The documentary record clearly indicat[s] that State agencies, led by
the executive's Financial Police, had pursued KPM and TNG (and their
personnel) on multiple fronts, including trumped-up [and contrived]
charges of criminal wrongdoing, which caused immediate harm to
Claimants’ investments. [...]

The campaign against Claimants’ investments in KPM and TNG that
Kazakhstan commenced in the final quarter of 2008 breached the ECT and
international law in multiple respects. It clearly entailed indirect
expropriation, because it materially interfered with Claimants’ ability to
manage, use, and dispose of their investments. The measures Kazakhstan
adopted — interference with contractual rights, wrongful exercises of
administrative and judicial authority, sequestration of the companies’
assets and Claimants’ shares, assessment of spurious tax penalties, and
harassment and persecution of key personnel — all fall squarely within the
bounds of indirect expropriation as understood in international law and
treaty practice.

Kazakhstan’s campaign was equally a violation of the ECT’s fair and
equitable treatment and impairment provisions, as well as its “most
constant protection and security” clause. Kazakhstan subjected Claimants’
investments in KPM and TNG to severe harassment and coercion as well
as inconsistent and contradictory conduct, and it created an environment
that was thoroughly unstable and unpredictable (if not treacherous).
Kazakhstan also flagrantly violated due process and committed “denial of
justice” in relation to KPM and its general director. At the same time,
Kazakhstan’s state apparatus, led by the Financial Police, utterly failed to
provide legal (and in some cases physical) protection and security to
Claimants’ investments and personnel, much less the “most constant
protection and security” required by the ECT.

Kazakhstan also breached key provisions of Claimants’ Subsoil Use
Contracts. For example, Kazakhstan imposed groundless and extra-
contractual tax assessments on KPM and TNG, and perhaps most notably,
it terminated those contracts in violation of their termination provisions.
Those acts were breaches of the ECT’s “umbrella clause.”

In July 2010, Kazakhstan directly expropriated Claimants’ investments by
terminating KPM’s and TNG’s Subsoil Use Contracts and seizing their
assets outright. Like the campaign that preceded it, Kazakhstan's ultimate

Page 144 of 414

expropriation was thoroughly groundless and illegal. By that point,
however, Claimants’ investments had already suffered 20 months of
indirect expropriation and other mistreatment that clearly violated the
standards of protection afforded by the ECT and international law.

[October 14, 2008 is the correct valutation date because (1) Kazakhstan’s
campaign against Claimants’ investments in KPM and TNG commenced
immediately after the directive, in breach of the ECT and international
law, (2) the 2008 campaign harmed Claimatns’ investments almost
immediately and the injuries continued thereafter, and (3) due to the
vicious downward spiral caused and fueled by the State’s campaign,
October 14, 2008 is the last date on which the Tribunal could assign a
value to the investments that was not diminished by the consequences of
Kazakhstan’s illegal conduct.]

Claimants’ valuations of their investments are fundamentally sound and
credible, as demonstrated by the fact that they are supported by multiple
contemporaneous valuations performed by sophisticated third parties.
Furthermore, they have been “‘reality-checked” by Claimants’ experts —
all of whose work is backed up with underlying data and modeling —
against other independent indicators of value. The 89-page RBS Asset
Valuation of mid-2009, performed with full access to Claimants’ data
room, clearly supports the main planks of Claimants’ valuation. So too do
the numerous indicative offers received from sophisticated energy
companies during Project Zenith, as well as the arms-length Cliffson
transaction of early 2010. FTI has also analyzed the trading prices of
comparable companies, the terms of comparable transactions, and the
trading value of the Tristan debt — all of which likewise support
Claimants’ valuation. [...]

The “enterprise value” of Claimants’ “Investments,” KPM and TNG, is
the appropriate measure of damages in this case, as it is in most treaty
arbitrations involving “investments” in wholly-owned companies
established in the host state. “Enterprise value” means the value of the
companies’ assets without deducting the companies’ debts.

Kazakhstan’s argument that the Tribunal should award “equity value” —
ie., that it should deduct the debts of KPM and TNG — is wrong as a
matter of fact and of law. Fundamentally, Kazakhstan’s “equity value”
argument is wrong because Kazakhstan seized all the assets of KPM and
TING, without assuming or extinguishing their debts. By seizing their
assets, Kazakhstan left KPM and TNG unable to satisfy their debts, and
Claimants remain responsible for doing so from the proceeds of any award
in this case.

The clear terms of the ECT as well as established treaty practice indicate
that compensation should include the debts of KPM and TNG, especially in
cases such as the present in which Claimants remain responsible for the
debts. Indeed, Kazakhstan has conceded that if Claimants remain
responsible for the debts of KPM and TNG — which they clearly do — an
award of “enterprise value” would be appropriate. An award of

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 146 of 415

40.

41.

42.

Page 145 of 414

“enterprise value” is also necessary to prevent the unjust enrichment of
Kazakhstan.

Claimants have firmly established that Kazakhstan agreed to extend
Contract 302 until March 30, 2011, but wrongfully failed to execute the
required addendum to the exploration contract. Claimants have also
conclusively demonstrated that they were actively in the process of
exploring and drilling in the Contract 302 areas in late 2008 and early
2009 — until the State’s refusal to execute the addendum and other
misconduct stymied their exploration activities — and that they had the
intent and the means to continue exploration through March 2011.
Claimants were particularly active in relation to the substantial Interoil
Reef prospect, in respect of which they had shot and interpreted 3D seismic
and acquired a specialized deep drilling rig that was being prepared for
transport to Kazakhstan.

As a direct result of Kazakhstan’s refusal to execute the addendum and its
campaign against KPM and TNG, Claimants were prevented from
advancing their exploration activities and drilling the wells necessary to
determine if hydrocarbons were present in the Contract 302 areas, at what
depths, and in what quantities and qualities. The only exception was
Munaibay Oil, where sufficient drilling had been completed to confirm a
significant discovery. For the other Contract 302 properties, however —
including the Interoil Reef — the State’s illegal conduct halted exploration
prior to the point at which Claimants had obtained all the data necessary

for their experts in this case to establish a fair market value. Claimants

therefore had no choice but to submit a prospective valuation for the
Contract 302 properties (except for Munaibay Oil).

The Tribunal should nevertheless exercise its discretion to award a
significant portion of the Contract 302 prospective valuation to Claimants
under the “loss of opportunity” doctrine. That doctrine exists precisely for
situations such as this in which claimants have been unable to demonstrate
their losses with greater certainty as a direct result of the host state’s
illegal conduct. A number of treaty tribunals have relied on the doctrine in
circumstances such as the present, and this Tribunal should do the same.
Indeed, a failure to do so would reward Kazakhstan for its misconduct.
(CPHB I {7 6-42).

Tolkyn US $478,927,000
Borankol US $197,013,000

damages in the amount of 10% of the total compensatory damages awarded to
Claimants, and (4) a full award on costs.

G.I. Summary of Contentions by Respondent

Respondent’s contentions are taken from its own words, without prejudice to their
further arguments:

11. The Republic is only prepared to offer the right to arbitrate to a certain
pool of investors. The parameters of entitlement are framed by the
provisions of the arbitration agreement in article 26 of the ECT, the rules
of the Stockholn Chamber of Commerce, international law and the
relevant rules of applicable law. The Republic has not consented to resolve
any dispute with any of the Claimants under the ECT through arbitration.

12. The Republic’s responses can be summarised as follows:

(a)

(b)

(c)

The ECT should be interpreted in accordance with international
law which includes the requirement to act in good faith in
accordance with the general principle of pact sunt servanda.

Anatolie Stati and Gabriel Stati, who allegedly own and/or control
Ascom, Terra Raf, KPM and TNG, are not true investors and none
of the Claimants is entitled to benefit from the ECT for the

following reasons:

Anatolie Stati is a political creature whose political connections,
previous expertise and other international dealings strongly
suggest that any investments he has made in Kazakhstan are not
made as a commercial investor in energy resources with which the
ECT are concerned. The same is true of Gabriel Stati who is more
a playboy than a businessman.

The benefits of the ECT are denied to Ascom under article 17 of
the ECT.

Gibraltar is not a party to the ECT and therefore Terra Raf cannot
seek protection from the Treaty.

No investments have in fact been made

There is an inherent meaning of “investment” which has to include
international law and national law. As such the inherent meaning
includes (1) Salini characteristics (which are relevant if not
exhaustive), and (2) compliance with the laws of the host State and
good faith.

. There was no investment on the facts.

There is insufficient evidence of investments being
made.

Oo Claimants have not demonstrated that it has acted
in good faith.

Oo Moreover, the investments allegedly made by the
KPM and TNG were in violation of Kazakh law.

(d) In any event, even if (any of) the Claimants were entitled to benefit
from the ECT (and can demonstrate to the relevant standard that
investments had been made), Claimants did not comply with the
cooling off period and therefore no jurisdiction vests in the
tribunal.

Lastly, Claimants have not discharged their burden of proof. Casting
Claimants’ arguments in the most flattering light, the case they now
present is at best ambiguous and unclear. As set out in the recent award of
ICS Inspection and Control Services Limited (United Kingdom) v.
Argentine Republic, PCA Case No. 2010-9, Award on Jurisdiction, 10
February 2012, “a State’s consent to arbitration shall not be presumed in
the face of ambiguity.” Where such consent is uncertain, no jurisdiction
should be found, and the case against the Republic falls at the first hurdle.
More likely, their assertions that their claims are entitled to any further
consideration by the tribunal are simply unevidenced and unfounded. (R-II
{7 11-14).

In their Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction and Liability, Claimants allege
that the umbrella clause embodied in the last sentence of Article 10(1) of
the ECT covers not only contractual but also statutory and regulatory
obligations, that the Subsoil Use Contracts and Contract No. 302 are
relevant under the umbrella clause and that the Republic has violated the
umbrella clause. However, these arguments have no merit. (R-II { 1053).

The guarantee under Article 10(12) of the ECT refers to the legislative
obligation to provide a fair and efficient system of justice and does not
encompass isolated failures of the judicial system in individual cases. Yet,
the Claimants misconceive the meaning of the duty arising from Article
10(12) of the ECT. Instead of addressing the adequacy of domestic
legislation, the Claimants focus on the judicial proceedings in one
individual case. In fact, the Claimants have not even contended, let alone
proven that the Republic has enacted legislation which does not provide a

fair and efficient system of justice.

Claimants allege that “in July 2010” the Republic directly expropriated
Claimants’ investment after already having indirectly expropriated it
“over the October 2008-July 2010 period”. Claimants go as far as
claiming that in this period, the Republic took several measures and “any

983.

984.

Page 148 of 414

number of them individually constitute an act of indirect expropriation”. In
making these assertions, Claimants effectively defeat their own argument.
Simple logic prescribes that something that has been taken once cannot be
taken again unless it has been returned. However, Claimants were not
expropriated once, twice or even several times — they were not
expropriated at all. (R-II J 864).

The Republic has explained that neither of these actions constitutes a
direct expropriation due to a lack of a transfer of title. Claimants sole
ground of opposition to the Republic’s argument is that the fact that no
transfer of title took place was “immaterial as a matter of international
law”. They have thus conceded that no transfer of title to the Republic took
place. Since, as explained above, there is no basis for Claimants’
contention that transfer of title is not required for direct expropriation to
occur, the only available conclusion is that the Republic did not directly
expropriate Claimants investments. (R-II J 890).

To reiterate the Republic’s position, the standard of fair and equitable
treatment needs to be considered against all the factual circumstances. In
a situation where the state action that the injured party claims of is one
which the aggrieved party has been granted a right to resolve at a local
level, there can be no conclusion that the state has acted unfairly and
inequitably if the aggrieved party has not actually pursued those rights. In
other words, a state (acting fairly and equitably) may provide an
opportunity (through the provision of contractual protection or through the
court system) for the claimant to seek redress of actions taken by the state
that may have been incorrect. This might apply to a decision of a first
instance court or the actions of an administrative official. This is a
fundamental part of providing a fair and equitable as well as stable and
predicable environment for the investment. As set out in Helnan v Egypt, a
treaty claim for the breach of fair and equitable treatment is likely to be
less successful where the claimant has not been able to show that the
system of investment protection in the host state has been unfair and
inequitable vis-a-vis the aggrieved party.

[The] duty of most constant protection and security requires a host state to
diligently implement reasonable mechanisms of protection. Claimants
have not challenged that the Republic disposes of the necessary legal
framework to provide protection to foreign investors and investments from
physical damage or violence. Yet, it is Claimants who need to prove the
absence of reasonable measures. Since they have failed to establish such
absence, their claim fails on this ground alone.

Apart from this, the legal and administrative system of the Republic is
indeed sufficiently developed and refined to the extent which can be
expected from a vigilant state exercising due diligence. The Republic has
enacted sufficient laws to protect nationals and foreign investors alike
from any physical harm.

Even if the scope of Article 10(1) of the ECT was not restricted to the duty
to implement reasonable measures for protection - which, as explained

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 150 of 415
Page 149 of 414

above, it is - Claimants still fail to establish that prerequisites of this
provision have not been met in this case. In their Reply Memorial on
Jurisdiction and Liability Claimants contend that the Republic violated the
guarantee by not providing the necessary physical security of Claimants’
assets. This reasoning is flawed. (R-II [1 982 — 984).

1009. [...] Claimants [...] begin their section by listing five cases in which the
tribunals found the respective host state to have violated [the duty to
refrain from unreasonable or discriminatory measures impairing the
investments pursuant to Art. 10(1) ECT.] However, [...] the Republic has
adhered to its obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT at all times. Its
measures were neither unreasonable nor discriminatory, nor was the
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of Claimants’
investments impaired in any way. (R-II J 1009).

1145. [...]Claimants allege that the Republic has failed to permit them to employ
key persons of their choice contrary to their obligation pursuant to Article
11(2) of the ECT. However, Claimants content themselves with drawing
the conclusion that the Republic violated this provision and do not bother
subsuming any facts under Article 11(2) of the ECT. Such conclusion has
no merit. [...] [The criminal proceedings and interrogations of KPM’s and
TNG’s employees have not hindered Claimants from employing key
personnel of their choice.] (R-II 1145, 1159, partially quoted).

687. Respondent’s contentions regarding causation are summarized in RPHB 2 4 61:

(a) Claimants mismanaged their assets on numerous occasions, for example
by putting alarmingly incompetent personnel in charge of important tasks
and by promising sales to business partners that they could have never
made.62 The mismanagement went so far that market observers were
concerned about “weak corporate governance standards at Tristan”.63
The overall level of mismanagement comes as no surprise given that
Claimants had no prior experience in oil and gas production and in the
Kazakh or international markets.

(b) KPM’s and TNG’s business was very risky from the start, as was set out
clearly in the Tristan note prospectus.

(c) KPM’s and TNG’s financing structure, which aimed at removing capital
from the companies, made them vulnerable to situations of crisis.

(d) Claimants took business decisions aimed only at short-term profit. In
particular the ramping up of production at the end of 2007 was short
sighted, as it led to a loss of available gas production for the LPG Plant
and the allegedly expected possibility of gas export (which the Republic
denies).

e) In April of 2008, Claimants found out that their estimates for production
from Borankol had been overstated by 300%. At the time, Claimants
received the new Miller&Lents reserves report68 which set out 2P reserves
of 24.6 MMboe. The earlier report by Ryder Scott had provided for 2P

reserves of 72.4 MMboe. 69 The effect of this loss was particular[ly]
significant because Borankol is a predominantly oil producing field and oil
production is much more valuable than gas production.

KPM and TNG were already in severe financial difficulties as of
Claimants’ valuation date, as is evidenced by the development of the
Tristan notes price.

Severe drops in energy prices and in demand, in particular due to the loss
of Kemikal as a customer, led to a very restricted cash position for KPM
and TNG. At the same time, the need for capital expenditure increased
markedly, putting further pressure on the companies.

Against this background, when uncontestedly legal tax demands were
raised by the state in the summer of 2009, Claimants had to take out the
horrendous Laren loan and issue new notes in the amount of USD 111.1
million in connection thereto.

Thereafter, Claimants deliberately chose to withdraw cash from KPM and
TNG, all while not fulfilling the annual work programs. This was
effectively the deliberate abandonment of the companies.

Respondent’s contentions in the case of quantum can be summarized as follows:

13

[...] Claimants’ claims fail for a lack of damage. In the following, the
Republic will establish through serious and thorough experts that

(a) the asset value of Contract No. 302 is zero;

(b) the LPG Plant may at best have salvage value which Claimants
failed to determine;

(c) the asset value of the Borankol field is USD 62.8 million;

(d) the asset value of the Tolkyn field is USD 123.2 million

(e) debt under the Tristan notes in the amount of USD 531.1 million
as well as other debt must be deducted from any asset value

assigned to the assets in question.

ip the final result after proper valuation and deductions is zero. (R-II
Y 13, emphasis added).

Respondent contends that (1) Claimants grossly inflated their damage claim, (2) 21
July 2010 is the proper valuation date, (3) the Cliffson SPA and the offers made in
Project Zenith are irrelevant to damages, (4) Claimants are not entitled to moral
damages, (5) the appropriate interest rate for compensation would not apply to
Claimants’ “Joss of opportunity” claim, and (6) that the Respondent is entitled to a
full award on costs.

H. Preliminary Considerations and Conclusions of
the Tribunal

 

The Tribunal has considered the extensive factual and legal arguments presented
by the Parties in their written and oral submissions. The Tribunal’s use of one
Party’s terms as opposed to another’s is not a reflection of the Tribunal’s legal
interpretation of an issue — rather, effort has been made to use consistent
terminology through this Award in order to facilitate understanding. Below, the
Tribunal discusses the arguments of the Parties most relevant for its decisions. The
Tribunal’s reasons, without repeating all the arguments advanced by the Parties,
address what the Tribunal considers to be the determinative factors required to
decide upon the issues arising to decide on the relief sought by the Parties. The
Tribunal considers, however, that brief repetition of certain aspects of its
conclusions in the context of particular issues is necessary, or at least appropriate,
in order to avoid misunderstanding.

H.I. Jurisdiction

1. The Parties’ Consent to Arbitration before the
SCC

a. Arguments by Claimants

The Tribunal’s jurisdiction over this dispute arises from Art. 26 ECT, the language
of which clearly points to the SCC as the proper forum for this dispute. The ECT
entered into force for Kazakhstan on 16 April 1998. (C-0 {{] 92 — 95; C-I {J 26 —
28; C-II {] 23 — 33; CPHB | { 43; CPHB 2 {{ 9).

After the Hearing on Quantum, Claimants argued that Respondent seemed to
abandon its linguistic contentions regarding the ECT. (CPHB | {{{[ 43 — 46).

Claimants reject Respondent’s linguistic analysis of Art. 26. (C-II {J 43 — 48).
There is no support for Respondent’s argument that the capital “A” in “Arbitration
institute” refers to the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC, and support to
the contrary is found on the official Russian language website of the ECT. (C-II {|
44). Likewise, there is no support for Respondent’s argument the use of the word
“international” is determinative in meaning. (C-II { 45). Claimants also state that
the words “in Stockholm” do not denote a seat and point out that references to
arbitral seats are notably absent in the other arbitration options in Art. 26(4) ECT.
(C-II { 46). As Respondent admits, all other authentic versions of the ECT clearly
refer to the Arbitration Institute of the SCC as the forum. The Russian-speaking
Contracting Parties to the ECT understood this. This is sufficient for the Tribunal
to find that the SCC is the proper forum. (C-II {[ 34 — 35). In addition, the
publications of the ECT Secretariat consistently refer to Art. 26 ECT as providing
for SCC, and not ICC, arbitration — to no state’s objection. (C-II { 51).

Even if Respondent’s translation arguments are correct, the Russian ECT must be
interpreted in conformity with the five others. (C-II {{[ 40 — 42). Claimants state
that under the rule of treaty unity — a core principle of interpretation of plurilingual
treaties enshrined in Art. 33(3) VCLT — treaty terms are presumed to have the same

695.

696.

697.

698.

699.

Page 152 of 414

meaning in each authentic text. Although the ECT is plurilingual in expression, it
is one single treaty with a single set of terms. Indeed, even Art. 33(4) VCLT
directs the Tribunal, to adopt the meaning that best reconciles the texts. Therefore,
the Tribunal should make every effort to find a common meaning among the ECT
texts, before preferring one to another. (C-II {J 38 — 39).

Other Kazakh documents, including a BIT between Kazakhstan, Belgium, and
Luxemburg and the Law of Kazakhstan on Foreign Investment use the language
“in Stockholm” as a reference to the SCC and not to an arbitral seat. (C-II { 46 —
48).

Claimants state that tribunals have accepted jurisdiction in all SCC arbitrations
involving Russian-speaking states brought under the ECT to date. None of the
respondent states have raised any doubt as to whether Art. 26(4)(c) ECT referred to
the SCC. (C-II {{ 50 — 52). The commercial arbitration cases relied on by
Respondent do not compel a different conclusion.

b. Arguments by Respondent

Respondent argues that it is not bound to arbitration under the ECT because the
offer to arbitrate contained in Art. 26(4) ECT is ambiguous and, thus, pathological.
(R-II { 241). The text in the Russian language refers to the Arbitration Institute of
the ICC, while the equally authentic texts in other authentic languages (English,
Spanish, Italian, German and French) refer to the Arbitration Institute of the SCC.
Pursuant to Art. 50 ECT, consistent with Art. 33 VCLT, the Russian ECT is
authentic, regardless of these differences. (R-I [J 6.5 — 6.8; 6.31 — 6.32). Asa
result, the offer contains indications for two different arbitration institutions. The
ambiguity of the offer stems from the irremovable discrepancy between the
Russian and other authentic texts of Art. 26 ECT. (R-II { 242). Since the
acceptance of an ambiguous offer cannot result in the conclusion of a valid
arbitration agreement, the alleged arbitration agreement between the Republic of
Kazakhstan and Claimants concerning dispute examination in the Arbitration
Institute of the SCC does not exist. (R-II { 243). Accordingly, the Tribunal should
decline jurisdiction. (R-I { 6.2).

Kazakhstan and Moldova assumed obligations under the ECT on the basis of the
Russian language text. (R-I {[{[ 6.33 — 6.36). Turning to Art. 26(4)(c) ECT, the
Russian text permits an investor to submit the dispute “to an arbitral proceeding
under the Arbitration institute of the international chamber of commerce in
Stockholm.” Respondent argues that each word in the ECT must be given due
consideration and submits that the key expressions for the Tribunal’s consideration
and analysis are “under the Arbitration institute” and “in Stockholm.” (R-I {J 6.11,
6.24).

Regarding the term “under the Arbitration institute”, Respondent submits that the
term means that a dispute should be considered by an arbitral tribunal acting under
the framework of a permanent arbitration centre — one with an institutional
framework for the administration of proceedings, a list of arbitrators, and rules for
proceedings. (R-I {| 6.12 — 6.22). One such institution would be the International
Court of Arbitration of the ICC, and the use of the capitalized “A” lends credibility
to the argument that that particular institute was intended. (R-I ff] 6.21 — 6.23).

Page 153 of 414

Regarding the language “in Stockholm”, Respondent submits that the only correct
interpretation of the Russian text is that “disputes may be submitted for
proceedings in Stockholm, and shall be considered by an arbitral tribunal
constituted under the rules of the ICC.” (R-I Jf 6.24 — 6.30). Respondent
highlights international arbitration cases that have considered similarly ambiguous
arbitration agreements and where the tribunal or court also found that the city
reference was merely to the place where arbitration was to occur, and not the
institution. (R-I J 6.28).

Respondent concedes that the clause may be simply ambiguous, lending itself to
several alternative meanings, including that it refers disputes to the “Jnternational
Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm” (in
which case, the words “Arbitration Institute’ would be interpreted to mean
“International Court of Arbitration”) or the “Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm
Chamber of Commerce” (and the words “international” should be replaced with
“Stockholm’). (R-I {J 6.9 — 6.10). The first of these alternatives is, however, most
plausible. (R-I { 6.10).

Respondent presents that arbitration is based on consent. Here, the investor must
accept the Art. 26(4)(c) ECT offer to arbitrate by submitting a request for
arbitration to the relevant institution. (R-I {J 6.39 — 6.44). Here, the agreement to
arbitration is void for uncertainty, the Moscow Commercial Arbitrazh Court (R-95)
and the Federal Supreme Court of Germany (R-96) have come to similar
conclusions in similar circumstances. (R-I {6.44 — 6.47).

Respondent argues that Art. 26(4)(c) ECT violates the jus cogens norm of the
sovereign equality of states and is, therefore, void. (R-I { 6.49 — 6.61). All of the
ECT texts, except the Russian version, allow an investor to commence arbitration
proceedings in the SCC. (R-I {[ 6.58). The consequence of this is that a Swedish
investor could commence proceedings with a Swedish arbitration institute (the
SCC) against a foreign state and potentially receive a ruling against that foreign
state, as has already occurred. (R-I { 6.59). This is a violation of the principle of
sovereign equality, because it gives Swedish investors an inequitable right to
commence proceedings in a (home) Swedish arbitration institute, which has a right
that other investors do not have — i.e., a Kazakh investor cannot commence
proceedings in a (home) Kazakh arbitration institute against Sweden. (R-I ff 6.58
— 6.61).

Based on the foregoing, Respondent argues that the Tribunal is under a duty to
decline jurisdiction. (R-I {| 6.48).

c. The Tribunal

While Claimants have stated that the consent to arbitrate pursuant to Art. 26 ECT is
no longer at issue (CPHB 2 fn 2), Respondent continues to incorporate its
arguments relating to Art. 26 through the second post hearing brief. (RPHB 2 fn
714).

There is no dispute between the Parties that Art. 26 ECT is the provision ruling on
jurisdiction. The ECT entered into force for Kazakhstan on 16 April 1998.

Page 154 of 414

However, Respondent maintains its argument that the Russian text of the ECT does
not provide for arbitration under the rules of the SCC. The Tribunal is not
persuaded by Respondent’s linguistic analysis. All other authentic versions of the
ECT clearly refer to the Arbitration Institute of the SCC as the forum of
jurisdiction. In addition, the publications of the ECT Secretariat consistently refer
to Art. 26 ECT as providing for SCC, and not ICC, arbitration — to no state’s
objection.

As Respondent concedes (R-I {I 6.9 — 6.10), the clause may be simply ambiguous,
lending itself to several alternative meanings, including that it refers disputes to the
“International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in
Stockholm” (in which case, the words “Arbitration Institute” would be interpreted
to mean “International Court of Arbitration”) or the “Arbitration Institute of the
Stockholm Chamber of Commerce” (and the words “international” should be
replaced with “Stockholm’”). However, Respondent argues that the first of these
alternatives is most plausible. (R-I { 6.10). The Tribunal disagrees. First, the
Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent’s linguistic analysis of the Russian text of
the provision, as the states ratifying the ECT were aware of the texts in the other
languages referring to the SCC and not objecting thereto or to the respective
publications of the ECT Secretariat. But, second, even if Respondent’s translation
arguments were correct, the Russian ECT must be interpreted in conformity with
the five others under the rule of treaty unity, which is the core principle of
interpretation of plurilingual treaties contained in Art. 33(3) VCLT: treaty terms
are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text. Although the ECT
is plurilingual, it is one single treaty with a single set of terms which should be
interpreted as having one meaning. Respondent has not provided any evidence that
the Russian text was intended to provide a different meaning regarding the
jurisdiction.

Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction under Art. 26 ECT and
under the Rules of the SCC.

2. Jurisdiction Ratione Personae
a. Arguments by Claimants

The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is governed by the express terms of the ECT. Each of
the four Claimants qualifies as an investor under Art. 1(7) ECT. (C-I {fj 29 — 32; C-
II {| 76 — 78; CPHB 1 {47 — 49).

Under Art. 1(7) ECT, “Jnvestor means... (i) a natural person having the citizenship
or nationality of er who is permanently residing in that Contracting Party in
accordance with its applicable law.” Anatolie Stati and Gabriel Stati each hold the
nationality of Moldova and Romania, which are Contracting Parties to the ECT.
They are, therefore, qualified as “investors” under the ECT. That is the end of the
inquiry. Their residence does not matter. Claimants have provided the Tribunal
with prima facie proof of nationality for each, including identification cards and
passports (C-II {{{[ 79 — 80, CPHB 1 {47 — 49; CPHB 2 {{ 10).

Respondent’s arguments that neither Anatolie Stati nor Gabriel Stati is an
“investor” are either wrong or irrelevant. Additionally, they are also contrary to

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 156 of 415

713.

714.

715.

716.

Page 155 of 414

Kazakhstan’s own internal documentation, which identifies Anatolie Stati as an
investor. (C-II 81). Claimants explain as follows:

82. Second, to the extent that Kazakhstan's jurisdictional objections relating to
Anatolie Stati and Gabriel Stati pertain to the legality of their investments,
they are misplaced. The legality of an investment has no bearing on
whether an individual qualifies as an “investor” under Article 1(7) of the
ECT. [...]

83. Third, Kazakhstan's contention that because “Ascom is not an investor,
Anatolie Stati also cannot be considered as an indirect investor in the
meaning of the ECT” is a non sequitur, and of no relevance to the
definition of “investor” under the ECT. Ascom qualifies as an “investor”
under the ECT on its own, as demonstrated below. Even if it did not, the
ECT protects indirect investments, and does not require that any
intermediary company qualify as an “investor” for an indirect owner to be

in “investor.”

84, Fourth and finally, Kazakhstan’s argument that “Anatolie Stati does not
have the capacity to act as an investor in the Republic of Kazakhstan” is
also beside the point. Nothing in the definition of "investor” under Article
1(7) of the ECT requires that the individual qualify as an “investor” within
the meaning of the national law of the host state. Kazakhstan’s attempt to
add its own self-serving requirement to the definition of “investor” under
the ECT is unavailing. (C-I {J 81 — 84, emphasis in original, citations
omitted).

The accusations that have been made against Mr. Anatolie Stati by the President of
Moldova are — absolutely —_ meritless. Claimants explain _ that
“Mr. Anatolie Stati’s investments in South Sudan are normal, commercial
investments in the oil and gas industry. He has contributed enormously to the well-
being of the population of South Sudan by making substantial investments in oil
and gas exploration and by building schools, a hospital, medical clinics, and
means of transportation in the region where his investments are located.” (C-I1 {]
194 — 195).

No legal authority exists that would allow Respondent to add additional
requirements into Art. 1(7) ECT. Respondent’s personal attacks on Claimants
“smack of desperation by a party with a losing case.” (CPHB | {| 47 — 48).

Turning to Ascom, Claimants produced the Certificate of Incorporation of Ascom
in Moldova as an exhibit to their Request for Arbitration and to their Statement of
Claim, and Kazakhstan does not contest the authenticity of that document.
Kazakhstan’s arguments concerning whether Ascom is a 100% owner of KPM —a
fact which has been recognized by the Financial Police — are irrelevant to
establishing whether Ascom meets the definition of investor under Art. 1(7) ECT.
(C-II qf 85 — 86).

Respondent seeks to improperly and retroactively deny ECT benefits to Ascom on
the basis of the so-called “/denial] of benefits” provision of Art. 17 ECT.
Respondent contends that because Ascom is incorporated in Moldova and
controlled by a Romanian national, Mr. Anatolie Stati, Ascom falls within the

717.

718.

719.

Page 156 of 414

denial of benefits provision in Art. 17 ECT. Kazakhstan’s reliance on Art. 17 ECT
is misplaced. Article 17 ECT only applies to Part III of the ECT, leaving
unaffected the dispute resolution provision in Art. 26 ECT. Article 17 ECT
concerns only the merits and not jurisdiction, and this view has been relied on by
the tribunal in Plama vy. Bulgaria, and was adopted by the Yukos tribunal.
Regardless, however, Art. 17 ECT only applies if a state invoked that provision to
deny benefits to an investor before a dispute otherwise arose. Since Kazakhstan
did not exercise this right, Art. 17 ECT is completely irrelevant to this case. (C-II
ql 87 — 90; CPHB 1 {| 50 — 52; CPHB 2 {{ 13).

Article 17 ECT has only a prospective effect and, even if this Tribunal were to find
that exercise of the “denial of benefits” could be retroactive, Art. 17(1) would still
be inapplicable because the two elements of that article are not met, namely: i) that
a legal entity be owned or controlled by citizens or nationals of a third state and (ii)
that that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting
Party in which it is organized. First, as is clear from the text of the ECT, a “third
state” under the ECT is a state that is not a party to the ECT. Second, the second
element is also missing, as Ascom’s board of directors and management direct and
control Ascom from its headquarters in Chisinau, Moldova. Even if Art. 17 could
be applicable, Anatolie Stati is the sole shareholder and has dual Romanian and
Moldovan citizenship. Both countries are parties to the ECT. Accordingly, neither
of the cumulative requirements of Art. 17 ECT would be satisfied. (C-II {J 91 —
95; CPHB | {| 50 — 52; CPHB 2 { 12).

Claimants state that Terra Raf was incorporated on 1 March 1999 by Southbridge
Services Limited and Cresmount Services Limited. On 27 January 2000, Messrs.
Stati acquired Terra Raf’s two sole shares and replaced the former directors as
Terra Raf’s new directors. In September 2004, Messrs. Stati increased their shares
to a thousand each, with each receiving an additional 999 shares. Claimants state
that Terra Raf’s certificate of incorporation clearly name Messrs. Stati as directors
and sole shareholders, directly owning and controlling 50% of it and of TNG and
its assets. (C-0 {[ 13; C-II { 96, 129).

In response to Kazakhstan’s contention that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction
over Terra Raf because the ECT does not apply to Gibraltar, Claimants explain
that, as the Petrobart v. Kyrgyzstan tribunal held, the ECT applies to Gibraltar by
way of Art. 45(1) ECT, which addresses provisional application of the Treaty. (C-
II {96 — 98; CPHB 1 {{[ 53 — 54; CPHB 2 { 11). Kazakhstan argues that
“[p]rovisional application of the ECT will cease: (a) by virtue of the Treaty coming
into force pursuant to Article 45(1); or (b) by virtue of a written notification
pursuant to Article 45(3)(a)” and that “the provisional application was de facto
terminated on that date in respect of the United Kingdom and all sovereign
territories of the UK, including Gibraltar.” (C-II {| 99 — 100, partially quoted).
This argument ignores ECT’s provisions which do not provide for de facto
termination. Instead, Art. 45(3)(a) ECT requires that provisional application be
terminated by written notification. This view was endorsed by the Petrobart v.
Kyrgyzstan tribunal and this view was upheld when the Svea Court of Appeal
declined to annul the award and found that the tribunal had correctly addressed the
jurisdiction issue. This is the only tribunal to date that has considered the
applicability of the ECT to Gibraltar. To date, no written notification has been
made with respect to Gibraltar.

Page 157 of 414

Kazakhstan’s attempts to distinguish Petrobart are misplaced. First, with respect
to the timing of the investment, that was not a consideration in the Petrobart
tribunal’s reasoning. That tribunal’s reasoning solely concerned the analysis of
Art. 45 ECT and the regime to terminate provisional application under that article,
i.e., a notification under Art. 45(3) ECT. The text of Art. 45 ECT does not indicate
that the timing of an investment should be of any relevance to termination of
provisional application. The question turns solely on whether the United Kingdom
or Gibraltar has made a declaration to terminate provisional application of the ECT
to Gibraltar. Neither has done so. (C-II j 103). Second, Kazakhstan’s contention
that “the terms of the UK's ratification document were clear notice that the UK
intended to end the application of the ECT to Gibraltar” is wrong. The UK
ratification document simply does not refer to Gibraltar at all. Furthermore, the
notification and the note verbale indicate Gibraltar’s intention to ratify the ECT
later. Both indicate that ratification by the United Kingdom and by Gibraltar will
be dissociated in time, thereby leaving intact the provisional application of the ECT
in the meantime. (C-II { 104). This interpretation is supported by Art. 40(2) ECT
on the application of the treaty to overseas territories, which clearly anticipates the
possibility of a dissociation between the date of entry into force for a state and an
overseas territory, and which provides that “/aJny Contracting Party may at a later
date [i.e., later than at the time of signature, ratification, acceptance, approval or
accession], by a declaration deposited with the Depository, bind itself under this
Treaty with respect to other territory specified in the declaration.” (C-II { 105).
Finally, termination of provisional application of the ECT has not been noted on
the Members’ page of the Energy Charter Secretariat, though it has notes on the
end date of Russia’s provisional application. (C-II {| 106). With regard to Dr.
Tietje’s allegation that the treaty practice of the United Kingdom since 1967 is not
to make a declaration regarding inclusion of an overseas territory at the time of
signature since such would usually have to be reconfirmed a the time of
ratification, it is clear that the United Kingdom did confirm that the ECT
provisionally applied to Gibraltar. (CPHB 1 {| 53 — 56).

Alternatively, should the Tribunal find that the ECT ceased to apply provisionally
to Gibraltar, the ECT nevertheless applies to Gibraltar on the basis that Gibraltar is
a part of the European Community, which is itself party to the ECT. (C-II {[ 108;
CPHB 2 411). Gibraltar’s parliamentary reports indicate that the ECT applies to it
on that basis. Pursuant to Art. 52 TEU and Art. 355 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union, Gibraltar is a European territory. (C-II {{[ 108
— 110, CPHB 1 { 56).

Finally, while there should be no doubt that Terra Raf is a qualified “investor”
under the ECT, the issue is of little ultimate relevance, because Terra Raf is owned
and controlled by Messrs. Anatolie and Gabriel Stati. The ECT protects their
indirect investments in Kazakhstan. (C-II { 112).

b. Arguments by Respondent

Respondent agrees that the definition of “investor” is set out in Art. 1(7) ECT. If
Claimants can provide evidence to discharge their burden of proof to the Tribunal,
namely that Claimants Anatolie and Gabriel Stati are citizens, nationals or
permanent residents of a contracting party, it is not for the Respondent to dispute it.
(R-I {8.1 — 8.6, 8.62; R-II J 19).

728.

Page 158 of 414

Nevertheless, the inquiry does not end there. Rather, when assessing jurisdiction,
the question of nationality is one which the Tribunal, may examine from the
standpoint of international law. Such an analysis, which mirrors the analysis to be
undertaken with respect to whether an investment has been made, considers the
overall nature of the Claimants and their general conduct. (R-II {{] 20 — 23; RPHB
1 9 420 — 422).

 

Turning first to Anatolie Stati, Respondent states that he cannot be seen as an
investor under the ECT because (1) he has not made any direct investments in
Kazakhstan, (2) his so-called investments are invalid under the laws of Kazakhstan,
and (3) he is not an indirect investor in any firm, since he does not hold the legal
capacity to act as an investor. (R-I {[f[ 8.56 — 8.61).

Respondent argues that Anatolie Stati is a highly skilled political animal who is
adept at converting long term assets into the short term aims of “advancing
political goals.” Anatolie Stati’s background is in the corrupt construction sector in
the former USSR. While his method of entry into the oil and gas industry is not
clear from Claimants’ submissions, it is clear that Anatolie Stati has established
himself in a position of power by playing in the political field in Moldova.
Anatolie Stati operates among a web of political figures who are engaged in
corrupt practices and terrorism — and that these actors have direct interests in
Anatolie Stati’s investments in Kazakhstan. Indeed, it appears that Anatolie Stati
pays politicians in return for political power, business connections, and
opportunities. Equally, politicians pay him to act as a front for their business
endeavours, as evidenced by Anatolie Stati’s investments in Turkmenistan, where
Anatolie Stati was involved in a document smuggling operation, for which his
political ties helped him in avoid prosecution. (R-II {| 24 — 33; 38 — 39; RPHB |
MI 420 — 427).

Claimants’ activities in Sudan (1) have been regarded as non-beneficial to the local
population, (2) have been questioned for a lack of transparency and (3) shed
serious concerns as to whether Claimants are entitled to protection under the ECT.
The statements made by both President Voronin and Mr. Andreyev in relation to
Mr. Anatolie Stati’s financing of illegal militant groups in Sudan in circumvention
of UN sanctions are not “defamatory.” There is nothing to suggest that both
President Voronin (as a political adversary) and Mr. Andreyev (as a former
employee) would not have had actual knowledge of Claimants’ businesses in
Sudan, given their respective relationships with Claimants. Their stories are
consistent, even though they have not interacted with one another. Moreover, since
the assets in Sudan are non-producing, it is likely that Claimants used money
received from Kazakhstan to finance the illegal activities there. (R-I { 9.57; R-II
QI 40 — 46; RPHB 1 {430 — 431).

Gabriel Stati — the pampered son of Anatolie Stati — is more a playboy than a
businessman. No stranger to controversy, he was arrested following the April 2009
elections in Moldova amid allegations that he was involved in the organization and
financing of civil unrest and attempting to overthrow the Moldovan government.
The Moldovan authorities attempted to extradite Gabriel Stati from the Ukraine.
There is little to suggest that he has had any active involvement in Claimants’
alleged investments in Kazakhstan. (R-I { 8.62; R-II If 34 — 36; RPHB 1| {{{[ 428 —
429).

Respondent disputes legality of Ascom’s 9 December 1999 purchase of the 62%
interest in KPM. Claimants made no payments in relation to this initial purchase,
but instead likely paid monies to a company called Telwin under a brokerage
agreement. Respondent alleges that, pursuant to this brokerage Agreement, Telwin
was obliged to find the owner of the rights in the exploration of the Borankol field
and to assist in the acquisition of those rights for Ascom. Telwin, however, held
85% of the shares of Aksai at the time and, therefore, received USD 1.5 million in
consideration for locating the owner of the rights, which it must have known that
Aksai owned all along. Respondent also states that payment of the purchase price
has not been proven. (R-II { 117).

The benefits of the ECT to Ascom should be denied under Art. 17(1) ECT,
pursuant to which a state can deny the benefits under the ECT if citizens or
nationals of a third state own or control the investor and if the investor has no
substantial business activity in the state in which it is organised. Presently, Ascom
fulfils both parts of this test. First, Ascom is controlled by citizens of a third state.
It is organized under the laws of Moldova, but is not controlled by citizens of
Moldova (since “third state” means any state other than the state of incorporation).
Thus, since Claimants state that Anatolie Stati and Gabriel Stati are controlling
Ascom, the Tribunal would have to find that Anatolie and Gabriel Stati, as citizens
of Romania, are citizens of a third state for the purposes of Art. 17(1) ECT.
Although Claimants attempt to avoid this conclusion by arguing that “third state”
in Art. 17(1) ECT means “states other than contracting states of the ECT,” this
argument is contradicted by the ECT’s use of the term “third state” in other
provisions, such as Art. 7(10)(a)(i) ECT. As a result, third state can mean
contracting and non-contracting states. Accordingly, Romania is to be treated as a
third state, thereby fulfilling the first part of the text. (R-I {8.9 — 8.10; R-II {J 47
— 52; RPHB | {432 — 434).

Second, Claimants have only made the unsupported contention that Ascom’s Board
of Directors and management direct and control Ascom from Moldova. Claimants
have not met their burden of proving that Ascom has substantial business activities
in Moldova, leaving the second part of the test fulfilled. (R-I {[ 8.10; R-II {J 53 —
54).

Since Ascom does not meet the requirements of Art. 17(1) ECT, Respondent can
deny it benefits under the ECT. Contrary to Claimants’ contention, the Republic
can do this retrospectively and Claimants did not challenge this in the Hearings.
The mere existence of Art. 17(1) ECT is a clear warning for a putative investor that
protection can be denied if the prerequisites of the provision are fulfilled. The
tribunals in the Plama and Yukos decisions erred when they based their findings on
the argument that a retrospective application would undermine an investor’s
legitimate expectations regarding the existence of protection under the ECT. The
Plama and Yukos decisions render Art. 17(1) inapplicable. These decisions are
also in clear neglect of investment practice. Foreign investors often times do not
even have to inform host states of their investment in the first place and investment
is made “under the radar” of the host states. Under such conditions, an effective
application of the denial of benefits clause would not be possible. Yet, tribunals
have frequently held that the effective interpretation of treaty provisions is
important. Thus, the tribunals in Ulysseas Inc. V. Ecuador and in Pac Rim Cayman

v. El Salvador were correct when they held that a denial of benefits clause could
have retrospective effect. (R-II {J 55 — 61).

With respect to Terra Raf, Respondent does not admit that Terra Raf is validly
incorporated in Gibraltar. Even if it were, however, Terra Raf would not be entitled
to protection under the ECT because the ECT does not apply provisionally to
Gibraltar, nor is Gibraltar a party to the ECT based on the EU’s signature to the
ECT. (R-I 8.11; RPHB | { 440).

Regarding the provisional applicability, although the Parties agree that the ECT
applied provisionally to Gibraltar prior to the United Kingdom’s ratification thereof
on 13 December 1996, the ECT no longer applies to Gibraltar on a provisional
basis. Provisional application of the ECT is regulated by Art. 45 ECT, which
provides for two methods of termination of the provisional application. Under the
de facto method of Art. 45(1) ECT, the entry into force of the ECT automatically
brings provisional application of the ECT to an end. The ECT entered into force in
the United Kingdom on 16 April 1998, and provisional application was de facto
terminated on that date in respect of the United Kingdom and all sovereign
territories of the UK, including Gibraltar. Alternatively, under the notice method
set out in Art. 45(3)(a) ECT, the entry into force of the ECT constituted notice of
the United Kingdom’s intention that Gibraltar would not be part of the ratification
of the ECT, and that its provisional application would also terminate. The United
Kingdom’s practice since 1967 has been to expressly declare the specific territories
to which a treaty shall extend, and Gibraltar was not included in the United
Kingdom’s declaration. Thus, to the extent that the ECT ever could have
provisionally applied, that terminated with the United Kingdom’s ratification of the
ECT on 13 December 1996. (R-I {iff 8.12 — 8.41; R-II {{[ 62 — 69; RPHB 1 {443 —
444).

The United Kingdom was within its rights to refuse to apply the ECT to Gibraltar,
even without consulting it. Further, the United Kingdom’s intention not to apply
the ECT to Gibraltar is confirmed by a note verbale dated 27 July 2004, which
made it clear that Gibraltar did not want the United Kingdom to ratify the ECT on
its behalf. (R-I {{f 8.27 — 8.30).

Respondent states that Claimants have seemed to drop their assertion that the ECT
applied to Gibraltar via the EU’s signature on the ECT and seemed only to
maintain their position that the ECT applies provisionally. Nevertheless,
Claimants’ EU arguments rest on the incorrect assumption that the EU is a
contracting party of the ECT. Respondent reminds the Tribunal that the EU is not
a contracting party to the ECT. The United Kingdom signed the ECT as an EU
Member State in a “mixed agreement.” This means that, the Member State signed
in respect of those matters where Member States align their policies with the EU.
There is a strong presumption that mixed agreements are concluded in territorial
areas which fall within the regulatory scope of the application of EU law.
Respondent states that Gibraltar is a disputed territory as between the United
Kingdom and Spain and, as a result, important aspects of EU policy do not apply to
Gibraltar. (R-II {| 70 — 72; RPHB 1 {{{[ 440 — 442).

Respondent denies that the case Petrobart v. Kyrgyzstan is a binding precedent or
that it may even serve as guidance to this Tribunal, since it was decided on the

Page 161 of 414

basis of facts different to those of this case. Notwithstanding the absence of
precedent in international arbitration, the Tribunal in Petrobart considered the
application of the ECT to Gibraltar in the context of investments made during the
period of provisional application of the ECT, but prior to its entry into force
following ratification. The present case, however, involves alleged investments
made several years after ratification of the ECT, by which time the ECT had ceased
to have any effect in Gibraltar. It is also noteworthy that the Respondent in that
case raised its objection to the ECT extending to Gibraltar at a very late stage in the
proceedings. Further, the Petrobart decision has been criticized on the basis that
the correct analysis should have been that Parties have to “opt in” on ratification,
rather than “opt out.” (R-I {J 8.11, 8.42 — 55).

Accordingly, Terra Raf is not an “investor”, as defined in the ECT. Any Art. 1(6)
ECT “investments” otherwise owned or controlled by it (100% of TNG, its assets
and the LPG Plant) have no protection under the ECT. (R-II { 72).

Respondent contests Messrs. Stati’s ownership of Terra Raf. Respondent states
that Claimants’ evidence at C-32 does not contain any information about Messrs.
Stati each owning 50% of the company and states that C-33 lists two British
companies as the founders of Terra Raf Traiding Ltd. Respondent states that
Claimants have not produced a single document that demonstrates their
relationship to Terra Raf. Respondent states that it appears that Terra Raf is a shell
company, existing only to hold shares of TNG. (R-I J 9.81, 14.9). To the extent
that Claimants seek to recover losses suffered by TNG, its assets and the LPG
Plant, clearly no double recovery for the same loss should be available (if it is
found that Terra Raf is an “investor” within the definition). (R-II { 72).

c. The Tribunal

As is not contested between the Parties, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is governed by
the express terms of the ECT and particularly the definition of “investor” in Art.
1(7) ECT. As is also undisputed, Claimants have the burden of proof that each one
of them qualifies as an investor under this definition.

The Tribunal will, therefore, address this issue for each of the four Claimants.

Regarding Messrs. Anatolie and Gabriel Stati, as natural persons, Art. 1(7) ECT
provides: “Investor means [...] (i) a natural person having the citizenship or
nationality of or who is permanently residing in that Contracting Party in
accordance with its applicable law.”

Claimants have provided the Tribunal with prima facie proof of nationality for
Messrs. Anatolie and Gabriel Stati, including identification cards and passports.
(C-II {J 79 — 80, CPHB 1 {47 — 49; CPHB 2 {{ 10). These show that each holds
the nationality of Moldova and Romania, which are Contracting Parties to the ECT.
Messrs. Anatolie and Gabriel Stati are, therefore, qualified “investors” under the
ECT. Their residence would only matter, as is clear from the wording of the
definition in Art. 1(7) ECT by the second alternative after the word “or”, if they
would not have the nationality of a Contracting State.

Page 162 of 414

Regarding the third and fourth Claimants, Ascom and Terra Raf, the definition in
Art. 1(7)(ii) ECT, according to which “Jnvestor means [...] a company or other
organization in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party”
applies.

To prove the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Ascom, Claimants have produced the
Certificate of Incorporation of Ascom in Moldova (as an exhibit to their Request
for Arbitration and to their Statement of Claim), and Respondent does not contest
the authenticity of that document. Respondent’s argument that Ascom falls within
the denial of benefits provision in Art. 17 ECT is not relevant in the present
context. Article 17 ECT, as clearly indicated by its introductory words “of this
part”, only applies to Part III of the ECT, leaving unaffected the dispute resolution
provision in Part V with Art. 26 ECT (see tribunal in Plama v. Bulgaria). And
further, Art. 17 ECT would only apply if a state invoked that provision to deny
benefits to an investor before a dispute arose and Respondent did not exercise this
right.

Turning to the fourth Claimant, Claimants state that Terra Raf was incorporated
under the laws of Gibraltar on 1 March 1999 and that Terra Raf’s certificate of
incorporation name Messrs. Stati as directors and sole shareholders, directly
owning and controlling 50% of it and of TNG and its assets. (C-0 {{ 13; C-II { 96,
129). Respondent argues that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over Terra
Raf because the ECT does not apply to Gibraltar. In that regard, the Tribunal
considers that it does not have to decide whether the ECT applies to Gibraltar by
way of Art. 45(1) ECT, which addresses provisional application of the ECT. (C-II
ql 96 — 98; CPHB 1 {| 53 — 54; CPHB 2 { 11). In addition, the Tribunal need not
consider whether, as Respondent argues, that provisional application of the ECT
has ceased or whether the decision of the the Petrobart v. Kyrgyzstan tribunal
provides guidance in this respect. For, in any case, the ECT applies to Gibraltar on
the basis that Gibraltar is a part of the European Community, which is itself party
to the ECT. According to Art. 52 of the Treaty on the European Union and Art.
355 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Gibraltar is included
in its territory.

For the above reasons, therefore, the Tribunal concludes that all four Claimants
qualify as investors under the ECT.

3. Jurisdiction Ratione Materiae — Existence of
Investment

a. Arguments by Claimants

All of the acts complained of occurred after the ECT entered into force for
Moldova, Romania, and Kazakhstan on 16 April 1998. Claimants’ investments fall
clearly within the definition of “/nvestment” in Art. 1(6) ECT, which Claimants
note is broader than the definition in many other investment treaties. This
definition includes every kind of asset, owned or controlled by an investor,
“including tangible and intangible assets, a company or business enterprise,
shares, equity participation, debt, claims to money or performance, returns, and
any rights conferred by law or contract.” (C-I {| 33 — 35; C-II {ff 119, 123 — 124;
CPHB 1 {[ 59; CPHB 2 { 14).

To take from Claimants’ words:

120. | KPM and TNG are energy companies that held Subsoil Use Contracts and
Subsoil Use Licenses from Kazakhstan for the exploration and production
of hydrocarbons. Claimants’ tangible and intangible holdings in
Kazakhstan included ownership of oil and gas wells, drilling equipment,
gathering pipelines, treatment and storage facilities, vehicles, offices, an
LPG plant, equity interests in KPM and TNG, and contractual rights
conferred by Kazakhstan to KPM and TNG under the Subsoil Use
Contracts and Licenses for the Borankol field, the Tolkyn field, and the
Contract 302 Properties. These are “any investment associated with an
economic activity in the energy sector” for the purpose of Article 1(6), and
they are encompassed by subcategories (a), (b), (c), (e), and (f) of Article
1(6). (C-II J 120, citations omitted; see also C-I { 34).

Claimants argue that the double-barreled Salini test, which requires establishing an
investment under both the applicable investment treaty and the ICSID Convention,
is not applicable here, as it only applies in ICSID cases. After the Hearing on
Quantum, Claimants reminded the Tribunal that the controversial Salini test is
applied in ICSID arbitrations because, unlike the ECT, ICSID does not define
“investment.” Furthermore, at best, ICSID applies the Salini test as a flexible
guideline, rather than as a strict jurisdictional requirement. (CPHB | {{{[ 60 — 62).
The Salini test — and likewise all cases that rely on it — is irrelevant to this
arbitration, and Respondent has not provided any ECT cases that apply the Salini
criteria. Although Claimants’ investments would clearly satisfy the Salini test,
there is no basis for the Tribunal to apply criteria outside of the ECT to establish
whether Claimants made a valid investment. The only relevant definition of
investment is that found in Art. 1(6) ECT. (C-II {J 114 — 116, 118, 122; CPHB 2 {[
15).

Characterizing Respondent’s contributions arguments as “irrelevant”, Claimants
explain that their investments resulted from substantial financial contributions,
including the over USD 12 million purchase price for KPM’s and TNG’s shares, as
well as investments in accordance with the working programs (which the MEMR
recognized that Claimants exceeded, both in terms of investment values and
financial obligations. Respondent has not contested that the amounts exceeded the
companies’ working program obligations by USD 400 million for KPM and USD
475 million for TNG. From 2000 until the end of 2009, Claimants invested more
that USD 1.1 billion in KPM and TNG. (C-II { 121; CPHB 1 {{{[ 63 — 67; CPHB 2
J 16).

After Hearings on Jurisdiction and Liability and on Quantum, Claimants explained
that they initially funded the operations of KPM and TNG through shareholder
loans, which are investments under Article 1(6) ECT. Furthermore, substantial
contributions to KPM and TNG were made through the reinvestment of profits. By
the end of 2008, KPM and TNG had nearly USD 400 million in retained earnings
on their balance sheets. This is disregarded by Respondent. Reinvesting profits is
an investment, as Art. 14(1) ECT guarantees Claimants the right to take the profits
or “Returns” of KPM and TNG and to distribute them as dividends or to spend or
invest them as they saw fit. (CPHB | {{ 68 — 72; CPHB 2 {[ 16).

Page 164 of 414

Respondent’s argument that the Tristan Loan financial structure deprives the
Tribunal of jurisdiction because it shielded Claimants from risk in relation to the
investments in KPM and TNG is factually and legally meritless. The Tristan note
offering was a normal public debt offering in which sophisticated investors
examined the business and financial status of KPM and TNG and found them
creditworthy. The third party financing for KPM and TNG from Kazcommerzbank
was approximately USD 145 million at the end of 2006. In 2006, the debt portion
of the capital structure was refinanced through the Tristan note offering, in order to
increase the available credit line and to obtain better credit terms. The notes were
issued by Tristan and were secured entirely by the assets of KPM and TNG and
pledges of Claimants’ equity interests in KPM and TNG. Claimants’ investments
remained at risk at all times, since Terra Raf and Ascom pledged their entire equity
interests in KPM and TNG to the Tristan noteholders as security. The pledge
agreements provided that in the event of default, Ascom and Terra Raf would be
required to provide any payments of any kind to the Tristan noteholders, including
payments received as a result of this arbitration. This pledge is in and of itself an
investment under Art. 1(6) ECT, which broadly defines investment as including
pledges. The pledges also satisfy the inapplicable Salini requirements of
substantial contribution, risk, duration, and benefit to the host State: “They are
substantial contributions to KPM and TNG in the form of legal obligations that
enabled KPM and TNG to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from the Tristan
noteholders. Those contributions entailed substantial risk, namely, Claimants’ risk
of losing their entire equity stakes in KPM and TNG and any payment received
through arbitration. Those contributions had a lengthy duration; Claimants
entered into the Pledge Agreements in 2006, and they remain in force today. And
the contribution benefited Kazakhstan, because it enabled KPM and TNG to raise
hundreds of millions of dollars to finance operations that provided jobs to
hundreds of Kazakh citizens and significant tax revenues to the Kazakh treasury.”
This is analogous to the case Enron v. Argentina, where the tribunal observed that a
guaranty could be treated as part of the investment. (CPHB | {[ 72 — 80; CPHB 2 {|
17).

Claimants state that there is no “origin of capital” language in the ECT’s broad
definition of “investment.” Thus, Respondent’s contention that the “real” investor
in KPM and TNG is Tristan Oil, and not Claimants, has no legal basis. Moreover,
as is plain from the text of Art. 1(6) ECT, which refers expressly to “every kind of
asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor” the ECT protects
investments that are not only directly owned, but also investments that are
indirectly owned or controlled. Claimants have demonstrated that Anatolie Stati
indirectly owned and controlled KPM and its assets, and that he and Gabriel Stati
each indirectly owned and controlled 50% of TNG and its assets. (C-II {J 125 —
129; CPHB 1 {{ 67).

Regarding the benefit that Claimants’ investments had for Kazakhstan, Claimants
point out that Kazakhstan has even recognized the “strategic role” that Claimants’
investment and development of the oil and gas fields has had for the Mangystau
Region and for Kazakhstan. This disproves Respondent’s allegations to the
contrary. In addition, from 2000 — 2009, Claimants KPM and TNG paid USD 163
and 187 million in taxes and administrative expenses, respectively. They
employed over 900 Kazakh citizens as permanent workforce and employed nearly
3,000 on a contract basis. (CPHB | {{[ 81 — 85; CPHB 2 { 18).

Page 165 of 414

Even though Claimants’ investments were made in good faith and in accordance
with Kazakh law, the ECT contains no such requirement that they be so made.
Indeed, if the contracting states had intended there to be such a requirement, they
could have written it into the text of the Treaty, as explained in the ICSID case of
Saba Fakes v. Turkey. Neither the ECT nor customary international law requires
that an investment comply with the minutiae of domestic and administrative legal
requirements in order to qualify for protection. Furthermore, tribunals under other
treaty regimes have only excluded an investment from protection in instances of
calculated misconduct amounting to fraud. (C-II {{[ 130 — 131; CPHB 1 {J 86 —
87).

Regardless, even where a treaty requires that an investment be made in accordance
with domestic law, it does not follow that any violation will preclude jurisdiction.
Indeed, tribunals that have rejected jurisdiction based on illegality — like the
Phoenix and the Plama tribunals - have done so when an investment amounted to
fraud. At issue here, however, are allegations of technical, minute — and meritless
— violations of formalities of Kazakh corporate law, coming nowhere close to
fraud. Hyper-technical, formalistic allegations of “illegality” precluding
jurisdiction have been uniformly rejected in treaty cases, including Tokios Tokeles
and Saluka, and this Tribunal should likewise do the same. (C-II {{] 132 — 137).

Respondent's allegations of illegal corporate formation are contrived and meritless.
Despite benefitting from, inspecting, and monitoring the corporate structures for
years, Respondent failed to allege that anything was illegal or improper prior to this
arbitration. This suffices for the Tribunal to reject Respondent’s formalistic claims
of illegality in this case. Claimants argue that Respondent created these illegalities
as part of its campaign of indirect expropriation, initiated in October 2008. (C-II
Ql 135 — 141; CPHB 2 {J 20 — 22).

Turning to the issue of KPM’s formation and share issuance, even if KPM failed to
submit appropriate documents, such failure does not result in a per se illegal
formation. Rather, such a failure would merely give Kazakh officials the right to
challenge the legality of KPM’s formation before a Kazakh court, pursuant to Art.
16 of the SM Law. Kazakhstan never did so and, by the time of the transfer of
KPM’s shares to Claimants, the registration requirement had been abolished.
Claimants concede that the previous shareholders of KPM failed to register KPM's
initial share issuance as required by law. Kazakhstan and investment tribunals,
such as Saluka, accept that there is a distinction to be made between former
shareholders and failings by claimants in an arbitration. The alleged technical
illegalities by former shareholders of KPM cannot taint Claimants’ title to shares.
Claimants state that Respondent is trying to create an issue where none. (C-II {[
142 — 143; CPHB 1 {| 88 — 91).

Further, Kazakh law does not recognize a concept of a transaction that was void ab
initio. Rather, pursuant to Art. 157(1) CC RK, all transactions remain valid until
voided by a court. Not only have there been no claims brought by Kazakhstan to
challenge KPM’s formation, but the 3-year statute of limitations for such claims,
which runs from the date when the person knew or should have known about the
violation, expired on 24 June 2000. (C-II {| 144 — 145).

Page 166 of 414

Despite Respondent’s arguments to the contrary, Ascom’s acquisitions of KPM
shares in 1999 and 2004 were lawful, despite not being registered, because JSCs
were exempted from an obligation to register their initial issuance of shares in 1998
— before the transactions at issue here. Further, as part of the amendments to the
law, the issuance of shares not subject to state registration required a national
identification number. After completing its review, the National Securities
Commission could either assign a national identification number, or refuse to do so
if its review of the submitted documents revealed any violation of law by the
issuer. KPM obtained a national identification number with respect to the initial
issuance of its shares on 24 January 2000. If there had been any irregularities, the
National Securities Commission was under a duty to notify KPM of these, rather
than assigning a number. Therefore, KPM’s initial issuance of shares duly
complied with Kazakh law from at least that moment forward. Claimants cured
any alleged defect in registration upon their acquisition of 62% of KPM’s shares in
1999. (C-II {f{ 146 — 149; CPHB 1 {| 88 — 91; CPHB 2 {{ 23).

Claimants also state that KPM has always been a commercial company — the so-
called “re-registration” as a commercial entity was nothing more than
Kazakhstan’s correction of its own clerical error. This is plain from a review of
KPM’s Foundation Agreement, which explicitly calls KPM a commercial
organization. KPM’s Charter contains no provisions related to the non-profit goals
of the company. Further, opposite of the goals of a non-profit, the explicit main
goal stated in KPM’s Foundation Agreement is that KPM is to obtain a profit.
Finally, KPM has engaged in commercial activity since its establishment and its
acquisition of a Subsoil Use License in May 1997 — 2 years before the alleged re-
registration. This Subsoil License even explicitly states that KPM’s main area of
business is commercial activities. The same commercial orientation is noted in
Contract 305. Indeed, if the registration authorities had correctly performed their
obligations, they would have registered KPM as a commercial organization from
the outset. Claimants state that they have no knowledge of the December 1999 re-

istration or of the d Respondent has submitted. (C-II JY] 150 — 155;
CPHB 1 [90 — 93).

 

Claimants present a history of Claimants’ acquisitions of KPM and TNG and their
development of these investments, and this is also contained in this Award in the
Timeline, above. Importantly, Contracts 305, 302, and 210 each contained
stabilization clauses stating that “/cJhanges and additions to the legislation made
after the signature of the Contract that deteriorate the position of the Contractor
shall not be applicable to this Contract.” (C-I {{[ 42 — 73). Claimants explain that
all of their acquisitions in KPM and TNG occurred after the elimination of the
licensing regime and authority. Moreover, Kazakh law required consent of the
Competent Authority only for transfers of subsoil use rights from one user to
another, not transfers of shares in a subsoil user. KPM’s and TNG’s subsoil use
rights were valid, and TNG and KPM violated no provisions of Kazakh law when
making amendments to their Subsoil Use Contracts without amending the
respective subsoil use licenses. Claimants explain that the 1995 Law on Licensing
did not apply to the issuance and emending of KPM’s and TNG’s subsoil licenses.
The subsoil licenses were issued in 1997, and are subject to the Subsoil Use Law,
enacted on 27 January 1996. This law and Government Resolution No. 1017 (16
August 1996) contained the licensing procedures for subsoil users. In August
1999, Kazakhstan abolished the dual licensing and contracting system with respect

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 168 of 415

Page 167 of 414

to subsoil use, moving directly to a contract-only system. Amendments to Subsoil
Use Licenses were effectively replaced by amendments to the subsoil use
agreements after the 1999 Amendments Law. (C-II {{{[ 173 — 182; CPHB | {{{[ 93 et
seq.). The specific arguments are best taken from Claimants’ words:

158. In August 1999, Kazakhstan abolished its dual licensing and contracting
system with respect to subsoil use and moved to a contract-only system of
subsoil use (“1999 Amendments Law”). Pre-existing subsoil use licenses
remained in force and their “suspension, revocation, termination, and
invalidation” were still governed by the 1996 Subsoil Use Law in force
prior to the 1999 Amendments Law. The 1999 Amendments Law
effectively “froze” the licenses, which could only be suspended or
withdrawn—but not amended—by the state authorities. Thus, only the
subsoil use contracts could reflect amendments to the terms of a subsoil
user’s rights and obligations.

159. The 1999 Amendments Law also resulted in a number of sweeping changes
to various legislative acts that largely eliminated references to a Licensing
Authority and its powers. In particular, those amendments deleted Article
7 of the 1996 Subsoil Law (Transfer of Subsoil Use Rights), which had
empowered the Government of Kazakhstan to issue and amend licenses for
subsoil use. Additionally, Article 8(1) of the 1996 Subsoil Law, which
previously stated that the Competent Authority “submits to the Licensing
Authority proposals for revocation of a License or making amendments
thereto,” was amended to provide that the “[Competent Authority] issues
consents for transfer of Subsoil Use Rights.” Likewise, the amendments
substituted the Competent Authority for the Licensing Authority in Article
14 of the 1996 Subsoil Law, which thereafter provided:

The transfer of Subsoil Use Rights by the subsoil user to another
party, made either against payment or for free, including by
contributing to the charter capital of a new legal entity, except for
the transfer of the subsoil use right as collateral, shall be permitted
only with the consent of the Competent Authority [authorized
government body]. (C-II {J 156 — 159):

764. Claimants even sought clarification on the relationship between the licenses and

765.

subsoil use agreements in December 1999. The Agency on Investment — the then-
competent authority — informed KPM by letter dated 18 January 2000 that,
pursuant to the amendments to the Law on Subsoil Use (11 August 1999), that
licenses for subsoil use shall no longer be issued, nor shall changes or amendments
be introduced into earlier-issued licenses. This was confirmed by the Government
of Kazakhstan on 14 May 2002 and by the MEMR in December 2008. (C-II {if
178 — 181; CPHB 1 qf 95 — 104).

Turning to Respondent’s argument under Art. 53 of the 1995 Law on Oil, while
that statute technically existed, it did not apply as a result of Kazakh laws
governing the hierarchy of statutory acts, pursuant to which in the event of
contradictory statutory provisions, the latter enacted Act shall prevail. Here, the
later amended 1999 Amendments were applicable. These required consent only for
the transfer of a subsoil use contract and not for the transfer of shares in a subsoil
user. (C-II {| 161 — 163; CPHB 95 — 96).

In spite of this, however, KPM and TNG twice sought consent for the transfers —
and they either received it or were informed that consent was not required. (C-II {{
156, 164). Only after Kazakhstan commenced its expropriation campaign in
October 2008 did Kazakhstan contend that those share transfers lacked the required
consents. (C-II {| 156; CPHB | {[ 96). It is simply not true that Claimants applied
to the wrong authority. On Respondent’s own evidence, the Competent Authority
on 26 April 1999 was the Agency on Investment, and the MEMR did not even exist
until 13 December 2000. (C-II { 166). It is also worth noting that on 20 February
2007, when the Appraisal Commission (responsible for deciding requests for
alienations of subsoil use agreements) allowed for the transfer of TNG shares from
Gheso to Terra Raf, and also expressly found that there was no deadline within
which TNG had to seek approval for the transfer of shares from Gheso to Terra
Raf. (C-II {| 167). Claimants state that exhibit C-134, which TNG received from
MEMR because it was the document granting permission for the share transfer,
shows that the appropriate governmental body consented to the transfer. Finally,
Claimants state that Respondent has conceded that it had approved the transfer,
stating that as part of its indirect expropriation campaign, it “annulled the earlier
issued permit.” (C-II { 168).

Respondent’s argument that the reorganizations of KPM and TNG from JSCs to
LLPs in 2005 were unlawful because Claimants were not the lawful shareholders,
is meritless. Ascom and Terra Raf were the lawful shareholders of KPM and TNG
(respectively) when the reorganization occurred. (C-II {{[ 169, 170). Registration is
deemed complete upon state registration, occurring here at the latest in May 2005,
when the Kazakh Ministry of Justice approved and registered KPM’s
transformation from a closed JSC into a LLP. Respondent did not question these
reorganizations until filing its Statement of Defense. (CPHB | {[ 92).

Nonetheless, even if the reorganizations were invalid, there is no “domino theory”
to chain transactions in Kazakhstan — a court’s finding that one transaction in the
chain was invalid will not serve to invalidate all later transaction. Rather, every
transaction remains valid until voided by a court. (C-II {| 170 - 172).

Turning to Respondent’s arguments that Claimants failed to apply for necessary
waivers of the Republic’s rights to purchase KPM and TNG, Claimants state that
Respondent had no pre-emptive rights at the time that any of the transactions
occurred — the last of which being Ascom’s acquisition of the remaining 38%
shareholding in KPM in November 2004. The state’s pre-emptive right did not
arise until 8 December 2004, with the amendments to Art. 71 of the 1996 Subsoil
Use Law. It applied only prospectively. Further, any attempts to cure defects in the
transfers after December 2004 would not trigger the Republic’s ability to exercise a
preemptive right. (C-II {J 183 — 186; CPHB 1 {{ 106).

It is not disputed that Claimants twice obtained waivers of pre-emptive rights from
Kazakhstan — once in 2007 in preparation of an IPO on the London Stock
Exchange and again in February 2007 when TNG applied for permission for the
2003 transfer of TNG ownership to Terra Raf (which TNG did not believe was
required at the time). Claimants state that it was not until 18 December 2008 that
Respondent attempted to revoke the waiver of pre-emptive rights, baselessly
accusing Claimants of fraud and forgery in connection with that waiver.
Respondent never provided any evidence of fraud or forgery, and never acted on

Page 169 of 414

the allegations. Respondent’s only objective in that retroactive revocation must
have been to cast a cloud on Claimants’ title to TNG, making it impossible for
Claimants to sell the business. (C-II {{{ 187 — 190, 228, CPHB 1 {{ 105).

It was a surprise when Kazakhstan requested that TNG apply for retroactive
consent for the 2003 transfer of TNG shares from Gheso to Terra Raf. Respondent
had no pre-emptive right request to any acquisition or share transfer in TNG, since
such prospective rights first arose on 8 December 2004 through the amendment to
Art. 71 of the 1996 Law on Subsoil Use. Respondent’s argument that the transfer
was not “completed” until 16 May 2005 and that that is why consent was required
has neither factual nor legal basis. Kazakhstan’s witness, Mr. Ongarbaev
confirmed that the transfer was completed at the latest on 28 May 2003. The only
reason that the 16 May 2005 date is relevant is because that was when TNG was
reorganized from an open JSC to an LLP, and that re-organization was re-
registered with State authorities and had nothing to do with pre-emptive rights.
Finally, Respondent only made this objection during proceedings and not even
KMG’s international counsel, Squire Sanders, raised any concerns about TNG’s
registration, even after analyzing the pre-emptive rights topic. Rather, and contrary
to Respondent’s selective quoting and mischaracterization of that report,
international legal counsel to KPM E&P, Squire Sanders, considered that Terra
Raf’s ownership of TNG was proper and legal and issued an opinion to that effect
in a due diligence report, which Respondent withheld from the Tribunal. (CPHB 1
ql 93 — 94, 106 — 110; CPHB 2 qf] 25 — 26).

Each of Respondent’s bad faith arguments — i.e. that (i) proceeds from those
investments were used to fund terrorist activities in South Sudan; (ii) KPM and
TNG guaranteed bonds issued by Tristan Oil, which “diverted” money from
Kazakhstan; and (iii) Claimants tried to illegally sell an investment they did not
legally own in the “Project Zenith” process — are frivolous and irrelevant. These
complaints are supported by unsubstantiated statements made by a disgruntled
former-employee in the context of a wrongful termination lawsuit, a defamatory
letter from a political opponent of Anatolie Stati, former President Voronin of
Moldova, and Respondent’s own misstatements. First, it has never been shown
that Anatolie Stati funded terrorist groups in South Sudan. Rather, Anatolie Stati’s
normal, commercial investments in the oil and gas industry have contributed
enormously to the well-being of the population of South Sudan by building
schools, a hospital, medical clinics, and means of transportation in the region.
Second, President Voronin’s letter merely demonstrates that he and President
Nazarbayev teamed up to undermine Anatolie Stati’s investments in one country
and his pro-democracy movement in the other. Third, in relation to Respondent’s
puzzling claims with respect to KPM and TNG guaranteeing bonds for Tristan Oil,
the bonds show no evidence of bad faith and the issue is irrelevant for whether
KPM and TNG are valid investments under the ECT. Finally, turning to the bad
faith allegations with respect to Project Zenith, Claimants state that they were
completely within their rights to offer these companies for sale - Kazakhstan acted
in bad faith and in breach of the ECT by interfering with Project Zenith and in
making the sale of KPM and TNG impossible. (C-II {{{] 192 — 197).

In order to receive protection under the ECT, the investments must meet the
definition of investment as articulated in Art. 1(6) ECT. The term “investment” has
a meaning in and of itself, and simply meeting one of the categories listed under
Art. 1(6) ECT is not sufficient. Instead, there are gaps in the Art. 1(6) ECT
definition of “investment”, and there is evidence to suggest that the Treaty parties
intended the term to mean more than “any right property or interest in money or
money’s worth.” (R-I [9.11 - 9.15, R-II {J 73 — 85, 83; RPHB 1 {| 446; RPHB 2
MI 384 — 385).

The first step this analysis is Art. 31(1) VCLT, which establishes the need to
interpret a treaty in good faith. (R-I { 9.40; R-II {| 79; RPHB 2 {[ 385).
International law is applicable by virtue of Art. 26(6) ECT, which allows the
Tribunal to apply applicable general principles of international law. (R-II {| 77).
Cases, such as Salini and Phoenix, are also relevant, since they amount to an
expression of international law. (R-II 179).

The Tribunal — like the tribunals in Romak, Alps Finance and Trade AG v. Slovak
Republic, and Compagnie International de Maintenance (CIM) v. Ethiopia —
should consider the term’s ordinary meaning, in light of other ECT provisions and
the ECT’s object and purpose, and should also consider the use of the term in
international law, as applied by other tribunals. (R-II {| 84 — 87). Accordingly,
Respondent asks the Tribunal to consider a broader meaning of “investment.” (R-II
al 80 — 82).

Contrary to Claimants’ argument, the definition of “investment” is not institution-
specific — indeed, to make it so would (1) encourage forum shopping within the
ECT (where investors have a choice of commencing arbitration under three
different institutions) and (2) would violate the principle endorsed in CIM vy.
Ethiopia that Parties should search for a consistent meaning across investment
treaties. (R-II {{[ 97 — 100; RPHB 1 {J 448).

The test for an investment available in ICSID arbitrations is one that should and
could equally apply in ECT arbitrations. This is because the ICSID and ECT
treaties are each predicated on general principles of international law, which allows
for a wider definition of “investment” than that set out in the text. Thus, it is
entirely appropriate for this Tribunal to employ tests like the ICSID-originating
Salini test, which has been employed in cases where Tribunals have had to construe
the word “investment” in accordance with its inherent meaning. (R-I { 9.5; R-II {{
95, 96, 99).

Pursuant to the Salini and Phoenix awards, an investment must have the following
six characteristics: (a) a contribution of money or other assets; (b) a certain
duration; (c) an element of risk; (d) a contribution to the host state’s development
that is made (e) in accordance with the laws of the host state and (f) in good faith in
accordance with general principles of international law. It is Claimants’ burden to
demonstrate that these characteristics have been exhibited in this case. (RPHB 2 {|
389). (R-I {iff 9.4 — 9.5, 9.10, 9.36 — 9.41, 9.45 — 9.47; R-II {{[ 100 — 108; RPHB 1
ql 449 — 450).

Regarding the financial contribution requirement (a), Respondent notes that,
although some tribunals have adopted the approach that an investment need not be

Page 171 of 414

substantial, the low purchase prices for the assets, placed in context of the
arbitration, raises doubts as to whether Claimants made was a true economic
contribution when making the investment. Claimants initially invested in the
businesses by way of share purchases and work programs. While Respondent
acknowledges that Ascom and Terra Raf provided USD 9 million for the purchase
of 38% of shares in KPM, it notes the Ascom - and not Terra Raf - purchased the
TNG shares for only USD 189,185. Claimants have not provided a share purchase
agreement for the purchase of the other 62% of shares in KPM. Instead, they have
only provided a brokerage agreement between Ascom and Telwin. For TNG,
while excerpts of the share purchase agreements were provided, the parts providing
the purchase price were withheld. All that was provided was Mr. Pisica’s
allegation that a total of USD 617,333 was paid for 100% of the TNG shares,
which Respondent notes is ridiculous when compared with Claimants’ claim of the
alleged value. No additional specification was ever given for Claimants’ assertion
that, between 1999 and 2004, Claimants invested over USD 12 million to acquire
KPM and TNG. (R-I {fff 9.27, 9.29 — 9.30; R-II {| 109 — 110, 116 — 118, 127;
RPHB 1 {{{[ 450 — 456; RPHB 2 {391 — 393).

Respondent also notes that it appears that Tristan Oil was contributing to and
getting value from the assets. Tristan Oil was the main financier of KPM and
TNG, and that this is not disputed by Claimants, who state that the ECT contains
no “origin of capital” requirement. (R-II {J 120 — 131).

Further, Respondent points out discrepancies in figures for amounts that Claimants
state were invested in the LPG Plant, the Contract 302 properties, or Claimants’
alleged own operating plant, as well as a huge disparity between the investment
purportedly made and the amounts claimed in damages. (R-I { 9.31; R-II qf] 123 —
126).

Respondent has not submitted arguments with respect to the element (b) duration.
Regarding the risk element (c), Respondent states that Claimants’ description of
their payments demonstrates that Anatolie Stati took on the least amount of risk
possible and that there was a lack of risk undertaken by other Claimants.
Claimants protected themselves from the companies’ liability by creating the
Tristan Oil structure and overexposing KPM and TNG to debt. This lack of risk
devalues Claimants’ arguments that they made investments in accordance with the
inherent meaning of the word. (R-II {[f[ 119, 128 — 132; RPHB 2 {[ 394).

Respondent argues that financial gain may not have been the primary motivator for
Claimants. (R-II {{{[ 128 — 132).

Respondent states that there was a lack of contribution to the economy of
Kazakhstan (d). First, Respondent notes that Claimants imported foreign labor into
Kazakhstan, rather than using local resources. Claimants failed in their obligation
to train Kazak specialists. Claimants’ evidence is incomplete and that Respondent
cannot assess whether USD 14,166,558 was in fact provided. Second, while
Claimants contend that they can do what they wish with their profits, Respondent
states that the entire structure of Claimants’ investment was aimed at taking any
money created by the investments off shore and not to making a contribution to the
host state, resulting from the investment. In 2008 and 2009, money and profits
were diverted from KPM and TNG into Montvale Invest — a Stati-owned BVI

company. Ascom responded to the financial crisis by stripping TNG and KPM of
their assets — by declaring dividends and paying a large bonus to Anatolie Stati. At
the same time, KPM and TNG paid little of the taxes due to the Republic. USD 62
million in corporate back taxes remain outstanding. The service agreements with
Ascom were typical of contracts that are used to transfer money between two
related companies without any actual services being performed. (R-II {{[ 122, 133
— 145; RPHB 1 {| 459 — 462; RPHB 2 {{ 395).

Respondent states that there was an undue exploitation of Kazakhstan’s assets and
that this harmed the Kazakh economy. Claimants’ increase of production in the
Tolkyn gas field was inconsistent with the strategy of maintaining the long-term
usefulness of the asset and resulted in falling reservoir pressure. Respondent
alleges that this action could indicate the “deliberate action of the shareholder,
which could be the result of irreversible loss of much of recoverable hydrocarbons
and growth capital expenditures of drilling new wells (each worth USD 15
million).” Confirmation of the diminished value of the assets are confirmed by
Claimants’ attempted sale in “Project Zenith” where no interested buyer could be
found once buyers discovered the value of the assets. At the Hearing on
Jurisdiction and Liability, Mr. Ongarbaev described the treatment of the field as
“barbaric.” (R-I JJ 9.69 — 9.70; R-II {| 133 — 145).

Regarding the legality of the investment (e), investments must be made in
accordance with the law of the host state. This is supported by both the Plama and
the Yallisoletana SL v. Republic of El Salvador decisions. The Phoenix and Plama
tribunals have agreed that national law forms part of the international legal
principles to be applied. Further, providing protection for investments that
contravene the laws of the host state undermines a broader compliance with
international law. Claimants’ investment was not made in accordance with Kazakh
law. Claimants have admitted that they breached Kazakh law and this admission is
enough to demonstrate that Claimants are not entitled to protection under the ECT.
Their breaches were not of “mere formalities” — they were substantial. (R-I {| 9.5
— 9.10, 9.25 — 9.16, 9.74, 9.87, 10.3, 25.10 — 25.14; R-II {| 78, 100 — 108, 147 —
204, 209; RPHB 1 {465 — 466; RPHB 2 {If 396 — 398).

Article 53 of the 1995 Law on Oil states that consent is required from both the
Licensing Authority and Competent Authority when there is a transfer of shares in
a company with subsoil use rights. As Claimants admit, the 1995 Law on Oil was
in existence when the share transfers occurred, and even when the law was
amended in 1999, the requirement for obtaining consent under Art. 53 was
maintained. In response to Claimants’ argument that it only needed to comply with
Art. 14(1) of the 1996 Subsoil law, as explained by Prof. Ilyassova, pursuant to
both Art. 14(1) of the 1996 Subsoil Law and Art. 2 of the 1995 Law on Oil, the
1995 Law on Oil actually took precedence over the 1996 Subsoil Law in the event
of any inconsistency. Accordingly, Art. 53 of the 1995 Law on Oil applied to the
transfers. Claimants are wrong that the 1996 Subsoil Law would have been
exclusively applicable — the laws had distinct scopes, one concerning oil and one
concerning subsoil use. A company would need to comply with both. (R-II {152
— 157, 168; RPHB 1 { 469, 470; RPHB 2 {{{[ 399 — 403).

Claimants failed to obtain consent from the Licensing Authority and Competent
Authority in relation to any of the eight transfers that involved TNG. Although

Page 173 of 414

Claimants received one authorization 4 years after the last share transfer in TNG
(from Gheso to Terra Raf), that consent does not “heal” the prior failures to obtain
consent for the three preceding transfers in TNG. Each of those prior transfers was
invalid under Art. 14 of the 1996 Subsoil Law. Further, the consent given was
legally invalid — Claimants failed to provide pertinent information, and the
Republic never granted a waiver of its pre-emptive right. There can be no doubt
that Terra Raf’s investment in TNG was not in accordance with Kazakh law — the
necessary and late-obtained consent for Terra Raf’s investment in TNG was validly
revoked as a result of Claimants’ provision of false and misleading information.
(R-II qf 148 — 149; 150 — 167; RPHB 1 {468 — 471).

Even when making their application for retro-active consent to the transfer of TNG
from Gheso to Terra Raf in February 2007, Claimants expressly conceded that Art.
53 of the 1995 Law on Oil was in force. Accordingly, Respondent had a right,
under Art. 71 of the 1996 Law on Subsoil Use as amended on 8 December 2004, to
purchase TNG. This made the purported transfer invalid if the Republic would not
waive its rights. (RPHB 2 {| 404 - 407).

In 2008, when the MEMR realized that it had been misled by Claimants regarding
the necessity of the waiver, the MEMR was obliged to revoke the waiver, pursuant
to Art. 15(2) of the 1996 Subsoil Law. Respondent denies that the revocation had
anything to do with alleged “harassment” and deny that there was an official
MEMR press release regarding this. Respondent states that KPM and TNG were
given the opportunity to dispute the charges, as evidenced through the
correspondence and meetings held. Nevertheless, it is evident that the problems
arising out of the transfer of TNG from Gheso to Terra Raf were caused by
Claimants themselves, likely in an effort to avoid having to obtain a waiver of the
Republic’s pre-emptive right. (R-II {| 170 — 176).

Claimants have provided no evidence for their argument that they were led to
believe that no consent was required for the transfer of TNG from Gheso to Terra
Raf because they were affiliated companies, and they did not make this argument at
the hearings. Mr. Pisica is not qualified to opine on Kazakh law. Further, any
alleged “affiliation” did not prevent TNG from belatedly requesting consent to the
transfer. Respondent argues that Claimants always believed that they needed
consent but simply chose not to obtain it. (R-II { 162 -163; RPHB | {| 472, 473).

In response to Claimants’ statements during the Hearing on Jurisdiction and
Liability, Respondent reminds the Tribunal that it was correct in questioning the
transfer from Gheso to Terra Raf. Respondent notes that there have been
additional irregularities in the many transfers involving TNG. Claimants have
produced a document which refers to Ascom owning TNG as of 15 September
2004, and at the same time argue that the last time Ascom owned TNG was in
2002. Further, Respondent it never conceded that Terra Raf’s acquisition of TNG
took place in 2003 and was registered at that time. (R-II { 173; RPHB | {{] 474 —
75).

The waivers obtained in 2007 in relation to the transfer of TNG and KPM to
Tristan Oil bear no relation to the TNG-Gheso-Terra Raf transfer. Nevertheless,
the Republic would not have waived its right in regard to the proposed transfer to

Page 174 of 414

Tristan Oil had it known that Claimants should have requested a waiver at the time
of the TNG-Gheso-Terra Raf transfer. (R-II {| 178 — 180).

Since the start of this arbitration, Respondent has discovered other serious breaches
of Kazakh law in relation to Claimants’ investment, which were concealed from
Respondent. Since Respondent was not aware of these, they were not grounds for
termination of the subsoil contracts. These violations include:

(a) Violations of Kazakh law in relation to the issuing of shares in KPM;

(b) KPM was transformed from a “non-commercial” entity into a commercial
entity in breach of Kazakh law;

(c) The transfer of KPM’s shares to Ascom was illegal due to the failure to
obtain consent from the Licensing and Competent Authorities;

(d) The reorganisation of KPM and TNG into LLPs was illegal; and

(e) KPM and TNG failed to amend their licenses when amending their
contracts. (R-II {J 181 — 182, citations omitted, see also R-II J 148 — 149;
RPHB I { 477).

Respondent argues that KPM’s share issue was void ab initio — a concept that
exists in Kazakh law. Claimants admit that KPM failed to submit the relevant
documents to obtain state registration, meaning that it did not have a national
identification number. It is unacceptable to describe this as a mere “technical”
error. Instead, under Art. 15 of the SM Law, the documents needed to be
submitted as part of the share issue — absent these, the share issue cannot be
registered pursuant to Art. 17(1) SM Law and, therefore, shall be deemed invalid
under Art. 17(2) SM Law. The Republic was not, as Claimants allege, required to
pursue this issue in court to challenge the validity of the registration. Likewise, the
matter is not time barred. Accordingly, being that the initial share issue in KPM
was invalid and Claimants nonetheless purchased the company, they cannot be
regarded as investing in accordance with host state law, as required under
international legal principles. At the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability,
Claimants addressed this issue and admitted that the shares were not registered
pursuant to Art. 16 of the SM Law. Claimants continued to rely on Prof. Maggs’s
report. Prof. Ilyassova explained, however, that under Kazakh law, transactions
can be considered invalid, without a court order. Likewise, the late registration of
KPM’s shares did not cure any defect with their registration. (R-II {{{[ 183 — 188;
RPHB | {| 478; RPHB 2 {fff 408 — 411).

Regarding KPM’s illegal transformation into a commercial company on 13
December 1999, Claimants have not provided any evidence that this was a mere
correction of a prior error or that Claimants were unaware of the change.
Accordingly, Respondent states, Claimants willingly invested in KPM as a non-
commercial entity, knowing it was carrying out commercial activities in breach of
Kazakh law. (R-II {if 189 — 192).

Regarding the unlawful transfer of KPM’s shares to Ascom, Respondent states that
this transfer required State consent under the 1995 Law on Oil. All that Claimants
have presented to demonstrate their consent is a letter from the State showing that

801.

Page 175 of 414

further action needed to be taken to obtain consent. As it cannot be said that
Ascom obtained consent to the transfer, Ascom acted in breach of Kazakh law by
making its investment in KPM. (R-II { 195).

Regarding the reorganization of KPM and TNG into LLPs, Respondent argues that,
since neither Ascom nor Terra Raf were legal shareholders in KPM and TNG, the
attempted reorganization of those companies into LLPs was ineffective and a
further breach of Kazakh law. The change was void ab initio — therefore,
Claimants’ point regarding there being no “domino theory” under Kazakh law is
misplaced. Further, Claimants cannot employ the statute of limitations to argue
that it did not breach Kazakh law as a matter of fact. Respondent states “/a]s to the
alleged three year limitation period which now supposedly bars the Republic’s
claim, the Republic has already explained above that the majority of the illegalities
came to light only after the commencement of this arbitration, by which point any
scope for bringing a claim would have been useless (since Claimants had
abandoned KPM and TNG).” (R-II J 196, 199).

Claimants failed to amend the licenses in accordance with the amendments to the
contracts. Claimants’ interpretation of Kazakh law that they did not need to amend
the licenses is simply wrong. Under Art. 26 and 29 of the 1995 Law on Oil, they
needed to extend their licenses as well as their contracts, just as other companies
did. (R-II {{[ 200 — 204).

Respondent states that Claimants do not deny breaching fundamental aspects of
Kazakh law throughout their investment, including:

(a) Unlawfully investing in the Republic and illegally engaging in activity
involving the Republic’s subsoil resources;

(b) Illegally operating a trunk pipeline without a licence in order to exploit the
subsoil area KPM and TNG operated in;

(c) Failing to pay legally imposed taxes as well as penalties it incurred; and
(d) Repeated violation of the Contracts resulting in their valid termination.
(R-II J 207).

The Salini requirements (e) and (f) apply, even though not expressly mentioned,
because it would be absurd to suggest that such fundamental principles of national
and international law would be inapplicable. Good faith has been recognized as
relevant for the ECT. Respondent’s arguments concerning “good faith” are best
taken from its own words:

9.43 An analysis of general principles of international legal practice and the
doctrine suggests that an investor's behaviour is not considered to be in
good faith if it:

(a) does not comply with local laws and contracts concluded by the
Investor (specifically the local law and the concluded contracts
upon which the legitimate expectations of the Investor are based,
subject to the protection of international law);

802.

803.

804.

805.

Page 176 of 414

(b) does not correspond to social and moral requirements (for
example if in violation of public order and justice); or

(c) does not respect the rights of counterparties and other participants
in civil commerce (the equal status of the parties). (R-I ¥ 9.43,
citations omitted).

Claimants’ attempt to counter the above has been limited to attempts to discredit
Prof. Olcott, who Claimants nevertheless quote when criticizing the quality of the
tule of law in Kazakhstan. This selective use of Prof. Olcott’s work suggests that
Claimants’ criticism of Prof. Olcott is superficial. (RPHB 2 § 413).

Regarding (f) whether Claimants have made a bona fide investment, Respondent
highlights that there is no evidence that Claimants have made their investment in
good faith. Rather, Respondent presents that it is difficult to believe that Claimants
Anatolie and Gabriel Stati have behaved as normal, commercial investors and
instead accuses them of corruption and engagement in criminal and terrorist
activities and/or civil unrest groups. As evidence of their corruption, Respondent
points to Claimants’ possession of confidential, internal government documents in
this case. At the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability, Claimants admitted to their
involvement in obtaining stolen documents. This is further evidence of Claimants’
corruption. (RPHB | {{ 481). Their illegal activities also include those regarding
the unlawful transfers, described above. (R-I { 9.51 — 9.59; R-II {| 210 — 214;
RPHB 2 {| 412).

Allowing a claim for damages based on the Tristan Notes to go forward would
enable the Claimants to circumvent the jurisdictional and substantive requirements
of investment arbitration. In particular, the noteholders would not need to
demonstrate either nationality or investment to bring the claim under the Kazakh
BIT. By claiming “enterprise value”, which represents the net present value of the
operating cashflow of an entity and includes the cash flows to creditors, Claimants
are claiming their own alleged damage and the damage of the Tristan noteholders.
Thus, this is a claim by one party on behalf of a third party, the Tristan noteholders
and this is impermissible. (RPHB 1 {{[ 415 — 419).

c. The Tribunal
The ECT provides the following definition of “Jnvestment” in Art. 1(6):

“Investment” means every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly
by an Investor and includes:

(a) tangible and intangible, and movable and immovable, property,
and any property rights such as leases, mortgages, liens, and
pledges;

(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms

of equity participation in a company or business enterprise, and
bonds and other debt of a company or business enterprise;

(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract
having an economic value and associated with an Investment;

806.

807.

808.

Page 177 of 414

(d) Intellectual Property;
(e) Returns;

ip any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licences
and permits granted pursuant to law to undertake any Economic
Activity in the Energy Sector.

A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as
investments and the term “Investment” includes all investments, whether existing
at or made after the later of the date of entry into force of this Treaty for the
Contracting Party of the Investor making the investment and that for the
Contracting Party in the Area of which the investment is made (hereinafter
referred to as the “Effective Date”) provided that the Treaty shall only apply to
matters affecting such investments after the Effective Date.

“Investment” refers to any investment associated with an Economic Activity in the
Energy Sector and to investments or classes of investments designated by a
Contracting Party in its Area as “Charter efficiency projects” and so notified to
the Secretariat.

By this extremely broad definition, particularly extended by its section (f) quoted
above, it stands in contrast to the ICSID Convention which contains no definition
of “investment” and thus needs further interpretation as regularly done by ICSID
tribunals. Guidelines and tests of criteria developed in this jurisprudence on the
ICSID Convention and similar treaties, therefore, cannot be used as long as any
right or activity is clearly covered by the wording of the above definition in ECT
cases. Therefore, the so-called Salini test, controversial and much discussed both
by the Parties in this case and otherwise in ICSID and similar arbitrations, even if
applied as a flexible guideline rather than as a strict jurisdictional requirement,
cannot be used for the definition of investment under the ECT or, likewise, in the
present case. The Tribunal, thus, sees no need to examine the various criteria
discussed for the Salini test.

Further, the VCLT expressly provides in its Art. 31.1 that a treaty shall be
interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its
terms. Article 32 VCLT provides that supplementary means of interpretation may
only be used in order to confirm the meaning from the terms of the treaty or, if the
Art. 31.1 interpretation leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure or leads to a
result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. These latter conditions for
recourse to supplementary means of interpretation are clearly not fulfilled by the
wide and highly detailed above definition of “investment” in the ECT.

KPM and TNG are energy companies that held Subsoil Use Contracts and subsoil
use licenses from Kazakhstan for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons.
Claimants’ tangible and intangible holdings in Kazakhstan included ownership of
oil and gas wells, drilling equipment, gathering pipelines, treatment and storage
facilities, vehicles, offices, an LPG Plant, equity interests in KPM and TNG, and
contractual rights conferred by Kazakhstan to KPM and TNG under the Subsoil
Use Contracts and Licenses for the Borankol field, the Tolkyn field, and the
Contract 302 properties. These are encompassed by the subcategories (a), (b), (c),
(e), and (f) of Art. 1(6) ECT and, further, by the language “any investment

Page 178 of 414

associated with an economic activity in the energy sector” for the purpose of Art.
1(6).

Claimants’ explanations as well as the evidence show that Claimants initially
funded the operations of KPM and TNG through shareholder loans, which are
investments under Art. 1(6) ECT, and that, later, substantial contributions to KPM
and TNG were made through the reinvestment of profits. Reinvesting profits is
also an investment, as Art. 14(1) ECT allowed Claimants to take the “Returns” of
KPM and TNG and to distribute them as dividends or to spend or invest them as
they saw fit.

The Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent’s argument that the Tristan Loan
financial structure deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction because it shielded
Claimants from risk in relation to the investments in KPM and TNG. The Tristan
note offering was a public debt offering in which investors examined the business
and financial status of KPM and TNG and found them creditworthy. The Tribunal
cannot see why this would prevent the investment from being covered by the
definitions in the ECT.

. Further, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent’s contention that the “real”

investor in KPM and TNG is Tristan Oil, and not Claimants. It is clear from the
text of Art. 1(6) ECT referring expressly to “every kind of asset, owned or
controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor” that the ECT protects investments
that are not only directly owned, but also investments that are indirectly owned or
controlled. Claimants have demonstrated that Anatolie Stati indirectly owned and
controlled KPM and its assets, and that he and Gabriel Stati each indirectly owned
and controlled 50% of TNG and its assets. (C-II {fj 125 — 129; CPHB 1 {| 67).

Respondent has also argued that Claimants’ investments were either illegal from
the beginning or became so at a later stage. First, the Tribunal notes that the ECT
contains no requirement in this regard. Indeed, if the contracting states had
intended there to be such a requirement, they could have written it into the text of
the Treaty, as explained in the ICSID case of Saba Fakes v. Turkey. This
consideration is even more valid in view of the extremely detailed definition of
investment and other details regulated in the ECT. At least with regard to
jurisdiction, the Tribunal does not see where such a requirement could come from.
Whether that aspect is also relevant for the merits of the case, will have to be
examined later in this Award. In addition the Tribunal notes that, as the timeline
above demonstrates, while inspecting and monitoring Claimants’ investments and
their corporate structures for years, Respondent failed to allege that anything was
illegal or improper prior to October 2008.

For the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction over the
investments made by Claimants.

4, Jurisdiction — Compliance with Three-Month
Waiting Period

Page 179 of 414

After the Hearing on Quantum, Claimants asserted that, after the Hearing on
Jurisdiction and Liability, it appeared that Respondent had abandoned its “cooling
off’ period arguments. In any event, Claimants satisfied any alleged duties during
the three month stay of proceedings. (CPHB | {| 44, CPHB 2 {{ 27).

While Claimants argue that they have complied with the three month waiting
period under Art. 26(2) ECT, they also argue that this is not a jurisdictional
requirement, but rather is a procedural hurdle. The procedural nature of the
waiting period has been confirmed by the vast majority of arbitral tribunals called
upon to decide upon the jurisdictional objections related to a claimant’s alleged
failure to comply with such a period. This solution is dictated by procedural
economy, since denying jurisdiction would simply force a claimant to re-start
proceedings a few months later — a solution that is in no party’s interest. (C-II {{f
53 — 57).

Claimants present cases where the tribunal has concluded that the waiting period is
procedural and not jurisdictional. In the Lauder case, the tribunal found that the
claimant had failed to comply with a six-month waiting-period under the applicable
BIT by filing its Request for Arbitration 17 days after the notice letter, but did not
consider that to be a bar to jurisdiction. Likewise, in Wena v. Egypt, in accepting
the respondent’s offer to withdraw its objection to jurisdiction based on Wena’s
alleged failure to comply with the three-month waiting period under the applicable
BIT, the tribunal viewed the requirement as procedural. The tribunal in SGS v.
Pakistan also chose to treat consultation periods as procedural rather than
jurisdictional. In Bayindir v. Pakistan, the tribunal held that the claimant’s failure
to comply with a waiting period under the applicable BIT did not affect its
jurisdiction. In Occidental v. Ecuador, the tribunal noted Ecuador’s own
acknowledgment at the hearing that “this is not an objection to jurisdiction that has

fared extremely well in many cases,” as well as Claimants’ argument that the

waiting-period requirement need not be respected if attempts at a negotiated
solution have proven futile. The tribunal found that “attempts at reaching a
negotiated solution were indeed futile in the circumstances,” and as a result, it
rejected Ecuador’s objection. Most recently and with reference to the SGS v.
Pakistan and Lauder v. Czech Republic decisions, the tribunal in the Paushok case
held that “/ajrguendo, even if they had failed to abide by the negotiating period,
this would not go to jurisdiction, as that delay has long expired.” Respondent has
presented no reason for this Tribunal to stray from such a consistent line of case
authority. (C-II {{[ 58 — 63, partially quoted).

Claimants two additional responses to Respondent’s arguments are best taken from
their own words:

64. Should the Tribunal consider that the requirement to observe a “waiting
period” is not a procedural requirement, the most appropriate alternative
characterization would be to regard the requirement as one of
admissibility, not of jurisdiction. In the Western NIS case relied on by
Kazakhstan in its correspondence with Claimants, the tribunal found that
the claimant had not given notice to the respondent as required under the
applicable BIT. The tribunal however concluded that this defect could be
cured by a suspension of the proceeding for the duration of the “waiting

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 181 of 415

818.

819.

820.

821.

Page 180 of 414

period.” In doing so, the tribunal effectively treated the requirement as
one of admissibility, not jurisdiction

65. Kazakhstan disregards the well-established line of case law on this issue
and relies on a distinctly minority view espoused in two cases, Murphy Oil
v. Ecuador and Burlington v. Ecuador. Those cases are distinguishable
from the present case on the facts, notably insofar as they did not involve a
stay of the arbitration for the parties to conduct settlement negotiations.
(C-II 1] 64 — 65).

In any event, Claimants maintain that they had complied with the “waiting period”
by the time they filed the Request for Arbitration on 26 July 2010. The waiting
period runs from the date Kazakhstan became aware of the dispute, which
Claimants (in an exercise of futility) raised on numerous occasions, starting at least
in March 2009. (C-0 {ff 109 — 110; C-I 4 38 — 39; C-II {{[ 66 — 68). This is
similar to the Paushok case. In any event, Tribunals — such as the recent Abaclat
tribunal which considered a similarly worded treaty, have emphasized that
compliance with a waiting period is not required where it would be futile. (C-II {{]
69 — 70).

Claimants agreed to stay proceedings in February 2011 in order to give Kazakhstan
an additional three month period. If any doubt remains, Claimants have
indisputably satisfied the “waiting period” requirement through their agreement to
a suspension of the arbitration for three months in 2011. During that time, there
were attempted settlement negotiations, which resulted in one meeting in London
on 10 March 2011. Respondent even concedes that the procedural requirements of
Art. 26(2) ECT have been met. (C-I J 40; C-II {§[ 71 — 72). Claimants state:
“[h]aving demanded and agreed to the suspension of the arbitration for the express
purposes of complying with the ‘waiting period’ in Article 26 of the ECT, it is
preposterous for Kazakhstan now to contend that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction
over the dispute because Claimants failed to comply with the ‘waiting period’ in
Article 26.” (C-II § 73). Respondent’s own statements confirm that the suspension
would ensure even jurisdictional compliance with Art. 26 ECT. (C-II { 74).

b. Arguments by Respondent

Claimants have not fulfilled the waiting period prior to initiating arbitral
proceedings, and this is fatal to Claimants’ case. The waiting period is a
jurisdictional requirement under Art. 26(1) and (2) ECT. This was recognized as a
safeguard in the case Murphy v. Ecuador. (R-I J 7.11 — 7.14; R. ltr. of 18 January
2011; RPHB 1 {{[ 482 — 483).

Respondent presents arguments applying Art. 31(1) VCLT (on giving words in a
treaty their ordinary and natural meaning in light of the Treaty’s object and
purpose) to Art. 26(1) and (2) ECT.

219. Article 26(1) provides that disputes “‘shall, if possible, be settled
amicably.” The types of dispute that are to be settled amicably in
compliance with Article 26(1) include alleged breaches of the obligations
owed by a State under Part III of the ECT. Article 26(2) states that one of
the dispute resolution mechanisms thereunder can be invoked if disputes
arising under Part III “can not be settled...within a period of three months

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 182 of 415

822.

823.

824.

Page 181 of 414

from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable
settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for
resolution...”.

220. ‘Therefore, the primary goal of the dispute resolution mechanism is
settlement (disputes “shall...be settled amicably”). The word “shall” is not
permissive, but mandatory and obligatory. This is clarified by the caveat
(‘shall, if possible”), which assumes that settlement may not always be
forthcoming. In this case, where one party has requested amicable
settlement and this has not been settled within three months of such
notification, the Investor may submit the dispute for resolution in
accordance with the terms of the remainder of the article. As to the nature
of those settlement discussions, it is settled under international legal
principles that they must be conducted in good faith. (R-II [J 219 — 220).

The importance and mandatory nature of the three-month period, as well as the
obligation to use that time to attempt settlement in good faith rather than simply
“wait it out”, is clear from the words of the ECT and this was noted by the tribunal
in Amto v. Ukraine. (R-II {J 221 — 223).

Prior to the 26 July 2010 Request for Arbitration, the Republic had no notice
(express or otherwise) of the imminent arbitration proceedings to be launched
against it, nor of the dispute (as set out in Article 26(1) ECT) to be referred to
arbitration. The events at issue occurred on 22 July 2010 — not five days before.
Even if the cooling off period were to begin to run from the date on which
Kazakhstan “became aware of the dispute”, as Claimants contend, this was not
prior to the Request for Arbitration. Finally, neither the letter dated 18 March 2009
nor the letter dated 7 May 2009 fulfilled the requirements of Art. 26(2) ECT. First,
both letters predate the majority of events which Claimants state gave rise to this
arbitration. Second, neither letter mentioned the ECT or contained an offer to
arbitrate. Third, even if these constituted effective notice, they could not have
constituted effective notices in respect of KPM, Gabriel Stati or Anatolie Stati, as
they were sent by TNG and Ascom. (R-I {fj 7.8 — 7.9; R-II {{][ 224 — 228; R ltr. of
18 January 2011).

Claimants cite decisions of other tribunals to support their contention that the
cooling off period is procedural, rather than jurisdictional. These cases are
irrelevant — not only because arbitration knows no precedent, but because these
cases bear little resemblance to Art. 26(2) ECT. The Lauder case, for example,
considered treaty provisions that were less strict and less specific than the ECT. In
Wena, the tribunal considered a treaty provision that required neither notice, nor
amicable settlement — and the respondent abandoned its jurisdictional objection in
any event. Western NIS concerned a BIT that did not explicitly provide for notice
(contrary to Claimants’ assertions) and found that notice was not a jurisdictional
requirement. It should be noted, however, that the tribunal in Burlington
considered similar wording and came to a different conclusion. What is most
important is that none of these cases concerned breaches of the ECT and are,
therefore, wholly irrelevant to the interpretation of Art. 26(2) ECT. Unlike the
definition of “investment” under Art. 1(6) ECT, this is not an instance where
general principles of international law demand a wider meaning; the words are
specific and sufficient. (R-I { 7.15; R-II ff 229 — 236).

825.

827.

828.

829.

830.

Page 182 of 414

If, however, the Tribunal is to consider comparisons with other investment treaties
as instructive, Art. 26(2) ECT is similar to provisions in the BIT between Belgium
and Burundi. Cases concerning that BIT have held that jurisdiction was not
established where the cooling off period was not satisfied. (R-II {{{[ 234 — 236).

Finally, the stay of arbitral proceedings cannot be conflated with a “cooling-off”
period.

237. The timing of any settlement discussions between the parties is key to
establishing whether or not the “cooling-off” period is satisfied. In this
case, the settlement discussions occurred after the Request for Arbitration
was submitted and therefore cannot be considered to fulfill the requirement
Jor the “cooling-off” period.

238. Claimants missed the “cooling off” period and no notice was given to
trigger access to the dispute resolution mechanism in Article 26(2). Such
failures cannot be cured retrospectively. The investor has all the time in
the world to bring the claim. The waiting period is also supposed to allow
the State to properly react and to properly prepare its defence. If the
waiting period is ignored, there is an imbalance. This imbalance cannot be
remedied by staying the proceedings at a later point in time. The defence
needs to be strong from the start. If it is not, it might be too late. (R-II {1
237 — 238; see also R-I 7.5).

The Republic has been willing to settle, and Claimants have not denied this. The
Tribunal awarded by consent on 22 February 2011 a stay of proceedings with the
intention of providing a window for settlement. In this order, the Tribunal
acknowledged that the cooling off period was not satisfied. (R-I { 7.10). While
procedurally, the provisions of Art. 26(2) ECT have been met, the settlement
period proposed by the Republic was without prejudice to the jurisdictional issues
that this defect could later cause. (R-I {{] 7.1 — 7.4, 7.16 — 7.18; R-II | 239).
Accordingly, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over this matter.

c. The Tribunal

Art. 26(1) ECT provides for a primary stage to settle a dispute amicably. And Art.
26(2) ECT provides for a three month waiting period for such settlement
discussions, before the dispute may be submitted to arbitration.

By the express reference in subparagraphs (1) and (2), it is clear that the intention
of Art. 26 ECT is to provide an opportunity of three months to the Parties to settle
the dispute. In view of this obvious intention, the Tribunal considers that to be a
procedural requirement rather than one of jurisdiction, at least as long as the Parties
have indeed had such a three months opportunity.

The Respondent concedes that the Tribunal awarded on 22 February 2011, by
consent with both Parties, a stay of proceedings with the intention of providing a
window for settlement. (R-I {[ 7.10). During that time, there were attempted
settlement negotiations, which resulted in one meeting in London on 10 March
2011, but did not reach a settlement. According to Respondent, while procedurally,
the provisions of Art. 26(2) ECT have been met, the settlement period proposed by
the Republic was without prejudice to the jurisdictional issues that this defect could

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 184 of 415

831.

Page 183 of 414

later cause. (R-I Jf 7.1 — 7.4, 7.16 — 7.18; R-II { 239). The Tribunal does not
agree. In view of the clear intention of Art. 26(1) and (2) ECT as indicated above,
after the failed discussions during the granted three month period, there is no
prejudice to either Party and there is no reason to deny jurisdiction.

5. Admissibility of Claimants’ Claims Pursuant to
ECT

a. Arguments by Claimants

Claimants’ arguments that there is no merit to Kazakhstan’s objection under
Article 18(2) ECT are best taken from their own words:

200. — Kazakhstan alleges that it is clear from Article 18(2) that the provisions of
the ECT — including the dispute resolution clause — do not apply to issues
related to a State’s rules governing the system of property ownership of
energy resources. Respondent contends that, pursuant to Article 18(3) and
18(4), “facilitating access to energy resources through, inter alia, licenses
and contracts forms part of the system of property ownership.” Therefore,
according to Kazakhstan, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear claims
relating to Kazakhstan’s right to audit KPM and TNG, the operation of
trunk pipelines, the tax proceedings, the enforcement proceedings, the
refusal to extend the period of the Contract 302 Properties, and direct
expropriation. These assertions are ludicrous.

201. Kazakhstan’s contention that Article 18 limits Contracting Parties’
obligations under Part III of the ECT has no merit, and Kazakhstan does
not cite a single legal authority or case in which its interpretation of
Article 18(2) has been accepted.

202. _ First, the plain text of Article 18 (Sovereignty over Energy Resources) does
not limit in any way the obligation of Contracting Parties under Part III.
It merely re-states the well established principle of sovereignty over
natural resources.

203. Second, Kazakhstan fails to mention Declaration No. V (appended to the
ECT) [which states in relevant part ‘The representatives declared that
Article 18(2) shall not be construed to allow the circumvention of the
application of the other provisions of the Treaty.”] and the Chairman of
the ECT Conference's Statement at the Adoption Session for the ECT on 17
December 1994:

Finally, I note that the representatives of Norway supported by the
representatives of ... Kazakhstan, Moldova... have declared that
the Treaty shall be applied and interpreted in accordance with
generally recognized rules and principles of observance,
application and interpretation of treaties as reflected in Part III of

may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification
for its failure to perform a treaty. The Treaty shall be interpreted

in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given
to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its
object and purpose. (C-II {J 198 — 209, partially quoted, emphasis
maintained).

Claimants point out that Declaration V is the only Declaration made by all ECT
signatories. It was made to preclude the very argument put forward by
Respondent, namely that Art. 18(2) permits a state to evade its obligations under
Part III of the ECT. This conclusion is supported by recourse to supplementary
means of interpretation, like the travaux préparatoire. (C-II { 206 — 209).

b. Arguments by Respondent
Respondent presents that the rights of the investor must be balanced against those

rights of the host State. As recognized in Art. 18 ECT, the State has the right to
regulate natural resources. (R-I {[{ 4.9 — 4.12). Respondent presents that “she

failures of the Claimants to provide any meaningful return to the Republic for their

alleged investments (in particular in relation to the payment of taxes and the

failure to contribute to the technological information exchange key to development)

not only attracted legal consequences in the Republic, but importantly casts doubts
on the Claimants’ suitability to benefit from investment protection at the
international level.” (R-1J 4.12).

Respondent argues that the Tribunal’s ability to hear Claimants’ claims is limited
by Art. 18(2) ECT, which states that the ECT “shall in no way prejudice the rules
in Contracting Parties governing the system of property ownership of energy
resources.” This applies to all articles of the ECT, including Art. 26 which
concerns the dispute resolution procedure. (R-I J 11.1).

The Russian language text of the ECT is more restrictive than the English one.
Whereas the English text says that the ECT “shall in no way prejudice”, the
Russian text says “shall in no way affect” or “shall in no way concern.” Although
the texts are equally authentic pursuant to Art. 50 ECT, Art. 33(2) VCLT
commands the Tribunal to apply the meaning that best reconciles the tests, having
regard to the object and purpose of the Treaty. Accordingly, the Russian text shall
apply in the present case, as it is narrower and reconciles both texts that, “the ECT
shall not apply to the provisions of national legislation governing the system of
property ownership of energy resources.” Likewise, Art. 26 ECT shall not extend
to issues related to the state’s rules governing the system of ownership for energy
resources, making also claims under Art. 10 and 13 ECT are inadmissible. (R-I {{]
11.5—11.15)

The majority to Claimants’ allegations fall within the Republic’s right to govern
the system of property ownership for its energy resources and, therefore, pursuant
to Art. 18(2), the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over these claims. These claims
include (1) The Republic’s right to audit KPM and TNG, (2) the claims regarding
the operation of trunk pipeli (3) tax p di (4) ion pr di (5)
the extension of the period for exploration under the Contract 302 fields, and (6)
the direct expropriation. (R-I J 11.16 — 11.28, 11:30, 13.48 — 13.63). Accordingly,
the Tribunal should decline jurisdiction.

c. The Tribunal
Art. 18(2) ECT provides:

Without affecting the objectives of promoting access to energy resources,
and exploration and development thereof on a commercial basis, the
Treaty shall in no way prejudice the rules in Contracting Parties
governing the system of property ownership of energy resources.

In addition, as Claimants have correctly submitted in this context, this provision
must be interpreted together with Declaration No. V, which is appended to the ECT
and which states in relevant part:

The representatives declared that Article 18(2) shall not be construed to
allow the circumvention of the application of the other provisions of the
Treaty.

In addition, the Chairman of the ECT Conference’s Statement at the Adoption
Session for the ECT on 17 December 1994 is also relevant:

Finally, I note that the representatives of Norway supported by the
representatives of [...] Kazakhstan, Moldova [...] have declared that the
Treaty shall be applied and interpreted in accordance with generally
recognized rules and principles of observance, application and
interpretation of treaties as reflected in Part III of the Vienna Convention
on the Law of Treaties of 25 May 1969. In particular in the context of
Article 18(2) they recalled that a party may not invoke the provisions of
its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty. The
Treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the
light of its object and purpose. (emphasis added).

Declaration V is the only Declaration made by all ECT signatories. From this
exceptional step, it is clear that it was adopted to preclude that Art. 18(2) would
permit a state to evade its obligations under Part III of the ECT. Therefore,
Respondent’s argument that the Russian language text of the ECT is more
restrictive than the English one cannot change this interpretation.

In view of these considerations, Art. 18(2) ECT does not prevent or limit this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Whether any of Respondent’s arguments, particularly
referring to the licensing and contracting structure within Kazakhstan (R-I {[ 11.16
— 11.28; 13.48 — 13.63), are relevant regarding the merits of this case will have to
examined later in this Award.

HII. Applicable Law
1. Arguments by Claimants
Pursuant to Art. 22(1) SCC Rules, this Tribunal shall decide the merits of the

dispute based on the rules of law agreed upon by the Parties. Accordingly, since
the Parties consented to arbitrate under the ECT and Art. 26(6) ECT contains an

Page 186 of 414

express choice of law provision providing that the Tribunal “shall decide the issues
in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of
international law,” the Tribunal’s task is to determine whether Kazakhstan violated
the ECT and international law. (C-I {| 239 — 242; C-II {] 423 — 437).

A state may not invoke its domestic law to justify or avoid liability for a violation
of its international obligations. This is incontestable. This is also true for
investment law cases. Kazakhstan is not permitted to evade its international
obligations to Claimants by contending that its subsoil use laws, its corporate laws,
or any other domestic legal rule excused its conduct. If the Tribunal determines
that Kazakhstan violated any of the substantive protections in the ECT or any
applicable rule of international law, that is the end of the inquiry. At most, Kazakh
law is relevant as a factual matter. No provision of Kazakh law alters that
conclusion. (C-I {{{ 239 — 242; C-II {{[ 423 — 437, partially quoted).

Claimants’ argument with respect to the Tribunal’s approach with respect to the
choice-of-law clauses in the Subsoil Use Contracts is best taken from its own
words:

438. — [...Even] if the Tribunal were to consider the articles on applicable law of
Contracts No. 305, 210, and 302 — which it should not — those articles
would require the application of the ECT and international law:

For the Contract as well as for other agreements signed on the basis of the
Contract, the law of the State shall be applied, unless otherwise stated by
international treaties to which the State is a party. (C-II { 438).

Claimants also argue that Kazakhstan cannot justify its past conduct through “new”
arguments under Kazakh law. Even though Kazakh law is irrelevant as far as
governing law is concerned, Kazakhstan is making arguments that it never raised
contemporaneously. New arguments include (1) claims regarding the alleged
illegality of Claimants’ investments in Kazakhstan, (2) Kazakhstan’s assessment of
export duties, (3) the reclassification of TNG’s and KPM’s filed pipelines as trunk
pipelines, and (4) new termination grounds for the Subsoil Use Contracts. Even if
Kazakhstan could rely on domestic law to evade its ECT obligations, Kazakhstan
would not be permitted to excuse its prior unlawful conduct by retroactively
conjuring up new legal arguments that allegedly might have justified its prior
conduct, but did not actually motivate its conduct at the relevant time. Indeed, this
is the same conclusion reached in Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Egypt, where the
Respondent attempted to retroactively excuse its seizures by arguing that Wena had
failed to comply with the leases. The same was true in Siag v. Egypt, where the
Tribunal rejected Egypt’s novel attempts to retroactively justify its expropriation of
Mr. Siag’s investments under Egyptian law. Indeed, in Siag, the tribunal rejected
each of Egypt’s ex post facto arguments and found that “an illegal expropriation
was carried out by Egypt, which may not be remedied by reference to Egyptian
municipal law.” (C-II {| 440 — 447). Claimants’ final point is best taken from its
own words:

448. — Kazakhstan’s new theories similarly ask the Tribunal to imagine that
Kazakhstan had chosen to rely upon legal grounds that allegedly would
have made its conduct legal under Kazakh domestic law, rather than adopt
the outrageous and unlawful course of action that it actually employed.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 188 of 415
Page 187 of 414

Beyond the fact that Kazakh domestic law cannot be used to excuse a
Treaty breach, Kazakhstan’s revisionist history is highly speculative and
dubious. Kazakhstan has cited no principle of international law (and
Claimants are aware of none) by which a State’s blatantly unlawful
conduct can be excused retroactively on the basis that the State supposedly
could have accomplished the same end lawfully (but did not). The present
Tribunal should refuse to entertain Kazakhstan’s attempts to retroactively
excuse its conduct. Whatever theories it now espouses, Kazakhstan cannot
undo the fact that it blatantly violated the ECT and international law in its
treatment of Claimants’ investments. (C-II 448).

2. Arguments by Respondent

846. Respondent’s arguments related to applicable law are best taken from its own
words:

834. — As Claimants agree, pursuant to Articles 22(1) of the SCC Rules and 26(6)
of the ECT, the arbitral tribunal shall decide the merits of a dispute in
accordance with the ECT and applicable rules and principles of
international law. However, many aspects of a complex investment
arbitration case are not covered precisely enough by the ECT and
international law. These lacunae need to be filled in by the host state’s
domestic law. [...]

837. In investment treaty arbitrations, the body of law best suited for filling in
the gaps of international law is the host state’s domestic law because
foreign investment always requires compliance with the domestic law of
the host state. Private and public international law aspects are
intrinsically linked:

“Investment disputes are about investments, investments
are about property, and property is about specific rights
over things cognisable by the municipal law of the host
state.”

838. Since international law and domestic law are intertwined with respect to
foreign investments, the host state’s domestic law is highly relevant for
determining any dispute. [...]

841. The host state's domestic law is highly relevant to a number of issues. In
particular, it is relevant to the question of whether an investment exists.
Furthermore, as noted by Newcombe and Paradell, it is relevant to:

“whether the investment is held in the territory of the host State, its
validity, the nature and scope of the fights making up the
investment and whether they vest on a protected investor, the
conditions imposed or assurances granted by national law for the
operation of investment, as well as the government measures
allegedly in breach of the investment treaty.” (R-II [] 834 — 843).

847.

848.

849.

850.

851.

852.

Page 188 of 414

Respondent explains that the Subsoil Use Contracts explicitly provide that both
Kazakh law and international law are applicable in relation to the relationship
between Claimants and the Republic. Kazakh law is essential for assessing (1)
whether an investment exists, (2) the legitimacy of the audits, inspections, criminal
proceedings, (3) the termination of the Subsoil Use Contracts, and (4) the
classification of Claimants’ pipelines. (R-II {| 844 — 847). Respondent states that
Claimants have admitted that Kazakh law is highly relevant, even alleging
violations of the Kazakh constitution and Kazakh statutes in their memorials. (R-II
848).

In response to Claimants’ irrelevant allegation that Respondent is relying “on
domestic legal arguments that it never made contemporaneously”, Respondent
states that this is irrelevant for the determination of applicable law and, indeed,
Claimants have failed to explain why this should have any impact on the applicable
law pursuant to Art. 22(1) SCC Rules and Art. 26(6) ECT. New legal arguments
for prior conduct do not change anything about the high relevance of the host
state’s domestic law in investment treaty arbitrations and the decisive significance
of Kazakh law with respect to claims in the dispute at present. (R-II {{{[ 849 — 850,
partially quoted).

Likewise, since Respondent only became aware of many breaches after
commencement of these proceedings, it is wholly logical that arguments about that
past conduct could not have been made contemporaneously. (R-II {{{[ 853 — 857).

With respect to the use of international law, Respondent encourages the Tribunal to
recognize, as have other tribunals like the $.D. Myers v. Canada tribunal, that the
determination on whether a state has acted unfairly or inequitably “must be made
in the light of the high measure of deference that international law generally
extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own
borders.” (R-II § 860). There is no breach of international law if the state court’s
decisions are reasonably tenable and made in good faith. Accordingly, when
addressing the conduct of the Republic from an international law perspective, the
Tribunal should consider the policy reasons that generally guide the Republic in the
regulation of subsoil use. The Republic has a reasonable expectation that foreign
investors make and manage their investments in a lawful manner and in a manner
which furthers the wealth of the Kazakh people. Through its laws and through the
authorities applying its laws, the Republic implements a policy that aims to ensure
that these expectations are being met by foreign investors. (R-II {{{[ 858 — 863,
partially quoted).

3. The Tribunal

The Tribunal agrees with the Parties that pursuant to Art. 22 (1) SCC Rules and
Art. 26(6) ECT, the Tribunal shall decide the merits of the dispute in accordance
with the ECT and applicable rules and principles of international law.

The question of in which way and to which extent the domestic law of Kazakhstan
becomes relevant will be discussed later in this Award in the context of the
breaches of the ECT alleged by Claimants.

HI. Considerations Regarding the Arbitral
Procedure

1. Arguments by Claimants

Claimants argue that Respondent has obstructed these proceedings from the outset.
It has attempted to “railroad the Tribunal” by (1) successfully requesting a 3-
month extension in order to satisfy Art. 26 ECT, after which Respondent continued
to argue that the same 3-month waiting period had not been met and that this
deprived the Tribunal of jurisdiction, (2) raising five objections to jurisdiction,
including the ludicrous one that the ECT is void because of an incomprehensible
interpretation of the Russian text, (3) submitting “sleeper” witness statements,
disguised as exhibits, that did not meet the requirements of Art. 4(5) IBA Rules on
the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (IBA Rules), (4) withholding
30,000 pages of mostly Russian-language documents relied upon by sleeper
witnesses, which was in contravention of Art. 5(2)(e) IBA Rules and the Tribunal’s
orders, until the Tribunal threatened evidentiary sanctions, and (5) accusing
Claimants’ counsel of withholding documents. In addition, Respondent has made
exaggerations and misstatements of law that go beyond zealous advocacy. (C-II {ff
21 —31; CPHB | 4; CPHB 2 {[ 28).

Claimants reject Respondent’s allegations that they intentionally submitted
misleading translations, illegally obtained documents, and obtained not genuine
documents. The errors to which Respondent points in the translations, in particular
the “investigate” and “thoroughly check”, among others, are distinctions without
difference — the expressions have the same meaning and Kazakhstan has not
explained the difference that these words could have in this case. In contrast,
however, Respondent has made numerous errors and omissions in its translations,
in particular with regard to Mr. Ongarbaev’s witness statement, where entire
paragraphs were deleted and sentences were added. (CPHB | {[ 111 — 114; CPHB
2 28).

Respondent has provided no support for its allegation that C-520 was altered, and
the incorrect registration number on that document is likely a clerical error.
Nevertheless, Respondent bears the burden of proving that the error was
intentional. (CPHB 1 {J 115).

Regarding the allegations of corruption in that Claimants presented internal
government documents, Kazakhstan has not established that the documents were
confidential or that they were obtained improperly. Their authenticity has never
been questioned. (CPHB | {| 116; CPHB 2 {[ 28).

Exhibit C-704 came from the Court and Claimants produced it exactly as they
received it. It was a draft transcript that was prepared prior to the judge’s
amendments. As explained at the hearing, it is completely unremarkable that
Claimants obtained a copy of the Blagovest letter, produced as Exhibit C-23.
(CPHB 1 {fff 117 — 118).

Respondent has provided no explanation for why Claimants would forge the
Report from Mr. Rakhimov to the Chief of the Financial Police, produced as

864.

865.

Page 190 of 414

Exhibit C-711. Mr. Rakhimov has also confirmed that such reports were created.
(CPHB 1 {ff 119).

Respondent has exacerbated the volume and complexity of this case by, in addition
to the above, submitting an entirely new case on quantum shortly before the
January 2013 Hearing on Quantum. This has led to the unprecedented situation
that Claimants had to address an entirely new case in a post-hearing brief. (CPHB

143).
2. Arguments by Respondent

Respondent argues that it has acted properly throughout this arbitration procedure.
Every example provided by Claimants is flawed.

Respondent’s request for a stay of proceedings in order to attempt amicable
resolution of the dispute was proper, and was agreed to by Claimants.
Respondent’s goal was to end the proceedings with a settlement agreement.
Claimants’ attempt to intertwine this stay with their failure to comply with Art. 26
ECT is, however, incorrect. The Republic proposed the settlement period,
expressis verbis, without prejudice to the jurisdictional issues that this defect could
later cause. (R-II {J 1160 — 1163).

Respondent’s jurisdictional claims are meritorious and are made in good faith.
Claimants ignore the fact that lack of jurisdiction is a very common and decisive
issue in investment treaty arbitrations. In many prominent investor-state disputes
under the ECT tribunals have held a preliminary hearing on jurisdiction. This is
not obstructionism: this is perfectly common and rightful behavior in an
investment treaty arbitration. (R-II { 1164).

With respect to the so-called “sleeper” reports, Claimants allege that the fact
witness statements do not meet Art. 4(5) IBA Rules. The IBA Rules, per PO-6, are
only guidelines. They are, therefore, not mandatory in this proceeding. The SCC
Rules, which Respondent is following, do not set such narrow limits to the

ibmission of witness Thus, the all ion that the d do not
meet the IBA Rules is irrelevant. Moreover, PO-2 Annex I already outlined the
next steps that the Republic needed to take with regard to the documents on which
the “sleeper” reports rely. (R-II {| 1165 — 1169).

Respondent states that “[c]lonsidering this detailed roadmap on the production of
documents on which the “Sleeper” reports rely and the adverse procedural
consequences looming in case of disregard, the arbitration proceedings have not at
all been obstructed. Quite the contrary, the Republic is committed to procedural
transparency and has been advancing the proceedings by complying with its
procedural duties in general and the aforementioned request of the Tribunal to
produce the documents in particular. This is acknowledged by Claimants in their
Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction and Liability, where they admit that the backup
documents have been disclosed by the Republic on 2 April 2012.” (R-IL{ 1170).

As for Claimants’ argument that the documents on which the “sleeper” reports rely
were withheld, in violation of Art. 5(2)(e) IBA Rules, those rules do not apply and
are only guidelines. Claimants’ argument is irrelevant. (R-II { 1171).

866.

867.

868.

869.

870.

Page 191 of 414

Claimants’ complaints regarding the April 2012 document production are
unfounded. The timely submitted documents were technical documents that were
known to Claimants. Despite the large volume of documents, Claimants opposed
extending the deadline. (RPHB 2 { 1033). As for the withholding of documents,
counsel explained in an email to the Tribunal on 11 April 2012 that, due to the pre-
requisite coordination with public authorities to obtain documents, it was not
feasible to produce those prior to 2 April 2012. Crucially, Respondent provided
them before the expiration of the deadline set out in PO-3. This was not, as
Claimants contend, a meticulous plan to force Claimants to seek extensions.
Respondent met the deadline — Claimants only have themselves to blame for the
extension. Furthermore, Claimants’ counsel was ineffective in analysing the
documents — documents which were largely already in Claimants’ possession at
that time. (R-II {J 1172 — 1175).

As another demonstration of Claimants’ bad faith, Respondent argues that
Claimants brought this present arbitration in an effort to avoid criminal liability in
the US as a result of their bond issuances and their unwillingness to pay interest or
to repay the amounts received. Respondent also accuses Claimants of submitting
false information with the Statement of Claim. (R-I {9.71 — 9.72).

Respondent also presents that the procedural timetable in this matter has been
unduly short for the issues at hand, and has been inherently biased in favor of
Claimants. (R-I J 3).

In Respondent’s First Post Hearing Brief, Respondent accused Claimants and
Claimants’ counsel of procedural misconduct and encouraged the Tribunal to draw
its own conclusions about the credibility of witnesses based thereon. — First,
Respondent alleged that some documents submitted by Claimants were obtained in
violation of Kazakh law, notably exhibits C-293 and C-294, C-704, and also those
listed in Respondent’s opening presentation at slide 29 and that this has been
conceded by Claimants and it remains unclear how these documents were obtained
and what reliability they may have. In this regard, Claimants’ C-704 is quite
questionable. While it purports to be the hearing minutes of Mr. Cornegruta’s
Trial, it contains no stamps and no signatures — it is neither a draft nor a copy. In
any event, it was not obtained lawfully. (RPHB | {{ 1120 — 1138). Second,
Respondent accuses Claimants of submitting forged documents, including C-495,
C-520, C-702, C-704, and C-711.1. For the transcript of Mr. Cornegruta’s trial (C-
704), when compared to Respondent’s official version (R-315.1 and R-315.2)
contain differences. Claimants’ transcript does not reflect a motion filed by Mr.
Cornegruta. Testimony was also changed. Third, Claimants have submitted
intentionally misleading translations in this arbitration, and the Republic has raised
this issue previously, especially in regard to C-8, C-98, and the fact that Claimants
have relied on these incorrect translations to create their claim. The correct English
translations are essential in this arbitration. (RPHB 1 {[f 1139 — 1175; RPHB 2 {ff
39 — 49).

Further complaints relate to Deloitte GmbH and the allegedly new case on
quantum. Claimants’ FTI Report was severely flawed and then Claimants silently
failed to produce Ms. Hardin, the main author of FTI | and FTI 2, for cross-
examination. The Supplemental Expert Report of Deloitte does not exceed the

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 193 of 415

871.

872.

875.

Page 192 of 414

scope indicated by the Tribunal on 24 April 2013, and Claimants never requested
to cross examine Mr. Gruhn again. (RPHB 2 {| 1034 — 1037, 1054, 1059).

The Republic was not authorized to disclose various due diligence reports prepared
for KMG EP in 2009. KMG EP is not the state, but later consented to disclosure
after the Hearing on Quantum. The content of these reports is excellent proof of
the lack of procedural misconduct by the Republic. They contradict Claimants’
allegations and support the Republic’s position. There was no reason, beyond
confidentiality, to withhold them. (RPHB 2 {[ 1038 — 1039).

Claimants’ argument that they were excluded from submitting further evidence or
from cross-examining witnesses, like Mr. Suleymenov and Mr. Mynbayev is
without merit — they never asked to do so and they did not hesitate to provide new
evidence during the Hearing on Quantum. (RPHB 2 {{ 1040).

Claimants’ continuous changes of their requests and the underlying facts put
Respondent at a considerable disadvantage. Claimants’ inability to produce the
main author or of the FTI Reports, Ms. Hardin, is one such example. It was
obvious that Mr. Rosen was not familiar with the first and second FTI Reports. At
the same time, he attempted to disregard the fact that Ms. Hardin had ever worked
on the documents. The Tribunal should exclude the FTI Reports in their entirety.
(RPHB 2 {{{ 1041 — 1048). In addition, to the extent that Claimants continue to
move for exclusion of the Deloitte Reports, Respondent requests the exclusion of
the FTI Reports. (RPHB 2 {ff 1052 — 1053).

In addition, Claimants were disruptive prior to each of the three hearings in this
case, thereby shortening and disrupting Respondent’s preparation time. In the lead
up to the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability on 1 October 2012, this included (1)
the 14 September 2012 request to submit new documents, (2) the 20 September
2012 request to submit different new documents, the 28 September 2012 request to
withdraw documents. In the time leading to the hearing on Quantum starting 28
January 2013, Claimants (1) made a midnight submission of the “Sharing
Agreement’, on 31 December 2012, (2) submitted a “Request to compel
production” containing new arguments and statements on 2 January 2013, (3)
submitted a further request regarding witnesses to the Tribunal on 2 January 2013,
(4) moved to submit new documents, including 3D seismic data, on 18 January
2013, (5) submitted a revised calculation of FTI on 25 January 2013, (6) submitted
the supporting materials for the revised FTI calculation and 27 January 2013.
Then, on the third day of the Quantum Hearing and in violation of the Tribunal’s
order, Claimants submitted the new evidence relating to 3D data, anyway. Next,
immediately prior to the First Post-Hearing Briefs and the Closing Hearing,
Claimants opposed Respondent’s request for an adequate, three-month, opportunity
to digest the newly submitted materials. To date, Claimants have failed to explain
their belated and clandestine submission of supporting documents to the Ryder
Scott Third Report. Then, one week before the Closing Hearing, Claimants
objected to the testimony of Mike Wood of GCA, since FTI’s Mr. Rosen would not
be present. (RPHB 2 {f| 1050 - 1051).

Claimants often unfairly attempted to limit the Republic’s defenses. (RPHB 2 {ff
1054 — 1056). They delayed filing their May 2012 submission, as well, without
excuse. (RPHB 2 {{ 1057).

876.

877.

878.

879.

Page 193 of 414

Claimants’ experts were complicit in supporting Claimants’ unfair procedural
strategy, and helped Claimants to have a procedural and substantive advantage in
having more time for the analysis of the 3D seismic data. (RPHB 2 {{ 1058).

Respondent upholds its procedural objections and consideration must be made not
only to the number of submissions, but also to whether sufficient time for
preparation was granted. Respondent upholds its objection of 11 January 2013 and
made orally on Day | of the Hearing on Quantum (objecting to the late submission
of the Sharing Agreement and reserving the right to address it in writing, to submit
expert opinions on it, and to request an additional hearing). Respondent also
upholds its objection of 6 March 2013, which was also raised on Day 3 of the
Hearing on Quantum (objecting to the revised report). Claimants’ experts’
testimony confirm that this objection is fully justified. Ryder Scott had been
complicit with Claimants in misleading the Tribunal though the Joint Issue List and
in submitting new and relevant evidence by surprise. These actions gave Ryder
Scott significantly more time to review the 3D seismic data, thereby giving
Claimants a procedural advantage over the Republic. Respondent’s experts (GCA)
confirmed that the time constraints had limited the scope of their work. While they
knew that the work existed previously, they had not reviewed it. (RPHB 2 {{[ 31 —
37, 1160 — 1067).

The Final Hearing also made Ryder Scott’s partiality apparent. Upon questioning
by the Tribunal about Ryder Scott’s role, Mr. Nowicki agreed that they had been
engaged by the client and might have that role (as opposed to having the role of
independently assisting the Tribunal). Repeatedly, Ryder Scott presented
Claimants’ counsels findings as its own. (RPHB 2 {[{[ 35 - 37

Claimants are not entitled to update their requests without the Republic being heard
on those requests or to simply leave it to the Tribunal to decide for them. (RPHB 2
4 50 — 55).

Claimants have alleged that the Republic has not produced certain government
instructions in these proceedings, but that allegation is misleading since Claimants
have not requested such production, outside of in their first post-hearing
submission. (RPHB 2 { 381).

3. The Tribunal

Throughout this procedure, the Parties have raised numerous objections to the
procedural conduct of the other side. The Tribunal has addressed these by a great
number of rulings in letters and procedural orders, all reflected in the summary of
the Procedural History provided earlier in this Award.

As recorded in the transcript (page 100), at the end of the last Hearing on 3 May
2013, the Chairman of the Tribunal raised the following question:

The Tribunal has, of course, taken note of the procedural objections that
were put on record at an earlier stage, and we take it that these will be
maintained. So my usual question at the end of a hearing only is: are there
any further procedural objections at this stage regarding the way the
Tribunal has conducted this procedure?

The Parties replied as follows:
For Claimant MR SMITH: None from the Claimants.
For Respondent DR NACIMIENTO: And none from Respondent

After the hearing, at the end of this procedure, the Tribunal notes that Claimants
have not raised any further objections against the way the Tribunal conducted this
procedure.

At the end of this procedure, in its 2nd Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent upheld its
earlier procedural objections.

The Tribunal does not see any need to reiterate its many rulings recorded in the
summary of the Procedural History provided earlier in this Award, all of which
were made in an effort to grant the Parties the opportunity to present its case and to
comment on the other side’s submissions and keep up a high standard of due
process.

The final hearing in May 2013 provided the Parties not only an opportunity for a
further examination of the technical experts, but also two rounds of oral closing
arguments.

Thereafter, as provided in PO-10, the Parties had and used the opportunity to
submit 2nd Round Post-Hearing Briefs (without any page limit) by 3 June, cost
claims | July, and comments thereon by 8 July 2013.

Taking all these procedural steps together, the Tribunal concludes that the Parties
have had ample opportunities to present their case and comment on the other side’s
submissions and every aspect of the case.

JI. Whether Kazakhstan Provided the Claimants’
Investments with Fair and Equitable Treatment
According to Art. 10(1) ECT

1. Arguments by Claimants

Article 10(1) ECT obliges Respondent to treat Claimants’ investments fairly and
equitably. As the term “fair and equitable treatment” (FET) is not defined in the
ECT, the term must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in light of the object and
purpose of the treaty. Given the breadth of the terms “fair” and “equitable,” their
context in the ECT and the object and purpose of the ECT, the FET standard in the
ECT prohibits a wide array of governmental misconduct and omissions. Thus, the
Tribunal “will have to decide whether in all the circumstances the conduct in issue
is fair and equitable or unfair and inequitable.” (C-1 {J 337 — 339).

With respect to the ordinary meaning of the terms “fair” and “equitable”,
Claimants explain that the ICSID tribunal in MTD v. Chile concluded that the
“ordinary meaning” of “fair and equitable” is “just, even-handed, unbiased,
legitimate.” (C-1 { 340, partially quoted).

With respect to the context and the object and purpose of the ECT, the Saluka
tribunal explained that the other provisions of the treaty, including the Preamble,
are relevant. Claimants explain that, pursuant to the Preamble and Art. 2 and 10(1)
ECT, the ECT was created to boost investor confidence and to increase investment
flows. (C-I {if 341 — 343).

Claimants also state that the Tribunal should consider the manner in which the FET
standard has been interpreted and applied under international law by the many
international investment tribunals that have considered the standard in recent years.
There is a considerable body of case law that has added specific meaning and
content to the standard, making it clear that specific types of host state misconduct
are prohibited. (C-I 344 — 348, C-II (501). The prohibited conduct includes:

. Actions that violate an investor's legitimate expectations in relation to the
investment;
. Conduct that creates an unstable or unpredictable legal framework or

business environment for the investment;

 

. Conduct that violates due process or results in a “denial of justice,”
including (but not limited to) improper judicial or administrative
proceedings as well as governmental interference in such proceedings;

Page 196 of 414
. Interference with a contractual relationship;
. Actions that treat an investor or an investment inconsistently, ambiguously,
or with a lack of transparency;
. Failure to sufficiently notify an investor in advance of impending acts that

will impact the investment;

. Actions that are discriminatory;
. Harassment or coercive conduct; and
. Conduct that is in bad faith. (C-I J 345).

Investment case law, including Waste Management v. Mexico, confirms that the
above list is an accurate representation of prohibited conduct. The Tecmed v.
Mexico decision presents the most frequently quoted articulation of the FET
standard, cited and applied by other Tribunals, including CMS, Azurix, MTD,
Occidental, LG&E, BG, and Suez. (C-I Jf 346 — 348). That description is as
follows:

[The FET standard] requires the Contracting Parties to provide to international
investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken
into account by the foreign investor to make the investment. The foreign investor
expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally
transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know
beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as
well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives,
to be able to plan its investment and to comply with such regulations... The foreign
investor also expects the host State to act consistently, i.e. without arbitrarily
revoking any preexisting decisions or permits issued by the State that were relied
upon by the investor to assume its commitments as well as to plan and launch its
commercial and business activities. The foreign investor also expects the State to
use the legal instruments that govern the actions of the investor or the investment
in conformity with the function usually assigned to such instruments, and not to
deprive the investor of its investment without the required compensation. (C-I J

47).

There is no exhaustion of local remedies requirement in applying the FET standard.
The Helnan Annulment Committee expressly annulled the part of the arbitral
decision that had taken the view Kazakhstan wants this Tribunal to adopt. There,
that Committee stated, “claimant’s prospects of success in pursuing a treaty claim
based on the decision of an inferior official or court, which had not been
challenged through an available appeal process, should be lower, since the
tribunal must in any event be satisfied that the failure is one which displays
insufficiency in the system, justifying international intervention. But that is a very
different matter to imposing a requirement on the claimant to pursue local
remedies before there can be said to have been a failure to provide fair and

q ble ” Thus, p of domestic dies is a factor in
determining whether the State’s treatment was fair, but it is not a pre-requisite. In
any event, such a requirement — even if it were to exist — would not be applied if

Page 197 of 414

pursuance of remedies would have been futile. (C-II {J 498 - 500, partially quoted,
emphasis maintained).

From October 2008 — July 2010, Kazakhstan violated nearly every aspect of the
FET standard that has been articulated to date, and Claimants refer the Tribunal to
their arguments concerning Kazakhstan’s excessive campaign of harassment and
interference with Claimants and their investments, and to the outright seizure of the
investment in July 2010. Claimants present 6 categories of actions which they state
violated the FET standard, summarized and partially quoted below. (C-I {{] 349 —
351).

First, Respondent “fabricat[ed] the grounds for criminal actions against Mr.
Cornegruta, KPM, and TNG” and that that was in violation of the FET standard.
This was based on the unfair, arbitrary, and false re-classification of KPM and
TNG’s pipelines into trunk pipelines. This reclassification was administered
unfairly, with even the Judicial Executor admitting that the segment at issue was a
mere “field” — and not “trunk” pipeline. The Financial Police were not a competent
authority to determine whether the pipelines in question were field or trunk
pipelines. There was no change in the pipelines that led to the re-classification.
Kazakhstan’s own officials approved the design and construction of the pipelines.
Respondent’s allegation that none of KPM’s or TNG’s previous licenses were
sufficient for the type of pipeline is preposterous. Further, “key personnel were
targeted as criminally responsible for the funds that corresponded to the dates of
their respective tenures as General Directors.” The reclassifications were
discriminatory — KPM and TNG were the only companies singled out for
reclassifications, “despite similar gathering systems being owned and operated by
other oil and gas companies in the immediate vicinity and throughout Kazakhstan.”
Finally, these criminal actions violated Claimants’ legitimate expectations toward
proper and fair governmental conduct. (C-I { 351, partially quoted; C-II {J 504 —
506; CPHB 1 {{{[ 150 — 213 et seg.; CPHB 2 {J 71 — 79, 87, 97, 99 — 100).

According to Claimants, the segments of Claimants’ pipes that are at issue extend
from the principal joint where the KPM wellhead pipes converge to KPM’s
processing facility, and from the processing facility to TNG’s storage tanks, where
services are also provided to KPM. For the TNG gathering system, the segment
extends from the principal joint where the TNG wellhead pipes converge to TNG’s
processing facility; from the processing facility directly to the CAC Pipeline for
gas; and from the processing facility to TNG’s storage tanks for condensate.
Claimants state that identical gathering systems are owned and operated by other
oil and gas companies in the immediate vicinity — and indeed throughout
Kazakhstan — none of which are classified as trunk pipelines requiring licensure.
Very few companies hold licenses for the operation of trunk pipelines. (C-0 {I 36,
39 — 40, partially quoted).

In any event, Claimants dispute that the pipelines are trunk pipelines. The
segments of oil and condensate pipelines that are at issue carried oil and
condensate to storage tanks, which are hardly another means of transport,
processing, or consumption. Claimants also state that the pipelines are not trunk
pipelines, because they are operated by contractors, and contractor’s pipelines are
not trunk pipelines as a matter of law. (C-II {{f[ 258, 260).

The criminal allegation of “illegal entrepreneurial activity in an especially large
amount” under Art. 190(2)(b) of the Kazakh Criminal Code was malicious and
contrived. Respondent contrived the operation of the main pipeline to satisfy the
“illegal entrepreneurial activity” element of the crime. The second element, “in an
especially large amount” was manufactured by manipulating instructions to the
Tax Committee and calculating the “illegal profits” by including both the transport
fee KPM earned from TNG for use of the pipeline, as well as KPM’s entire
revenues from the onward sales of oil. Kazakhstan assessed “illegal profits” from
operating the trunk pipeline — and this fine amounted to more than 65 billion Tenge
for KPM and more than 82 billion Tenge for TNG — reflecting all of the revenue
that both companies had generate for oil, gas, and condensate production from
2002 — 2008. These calculations were unfair, did not consider expenses or costs,
and did not correspond to the transportation fees that would have applied if the
pipeline segment was truly a trunk pipeline. Importantly, the fine was contrary to
Kazakh law, which requires the deduction of lawfully obtained revenue from
otherwise illegal activity. The proper calculation would have yielded USD 12,000
— 13,000 in illegal profits — below the USD 17,000 threshold for the crime.
(CPHB 2 {| 80 — 84, 87)

Under Vivendi II, which provides guidance on the types of measures that give rise
to international liability for disproportionate measures, the USD 145 fine against
KPM for a failure to get an USD 80 license is disproportionate. Likewise,
Occidential v. Ecuador found that the loss of an investment worth hundreds of
millions of dollars was disproportionate to the state goal of deterrence. (CPHB 2

ql 92 — 93).

The pipeline was not indispensible to KPM’s ability to sell oil, as Kazakhstan
alleges. Even if the calculation were correct, which Claimants deny, the USD 145
million fine was grossly disproportionate, especially compared to the USD 80 fee
to obtain a main pipeline license or the USD 12,000 — 13,000 in actual profits
earned from operating the pipeline. It was higher than the total profits earned by
KazTransOil during 2007 and 2008. This fine would be in violation of
international law as being disproportionate to the wrong that the state is trying to
address. Here, no harm resulted from KPM’s operation of the pipeline and there
was no risk beyond those presented by other parts of KPM’s extensive gathering
system. The USD 80 license is not material, and was only issued to KMT in 2011,
a year after it took over KPM’s operations. (CPHB 2 4 81, 85, 89, 91, 95).

Whether the opaque regulations were a violation of the FET standard is an
alternative case that the Tribunal may not even need to consider, since the evidence
that neither KPM nor TNG operated a main oil and gas pipeline is overwhelming.
Kazakhstan has essentially defended the wrongful and unwarranted “main
pipeline” conclusions of its Financial Police, Mr. Baymaganbetov, and the Aktau
City Court by arguing that its regulatory regime in relation to main pipeline
licensing was so lacking in transparency that only the country’s prosecutor could
provide the correct answer. Even if Kazakhstan’s argument were credible — which
it is obviously not — it would do Kazakhstan no good in terms of escaping liability
under the ECT. The ECT’s FET standard requires a consistent, transparent
regulatory framework every bit as much as it precludes arbitrary prosecutions and
denials of justice. (CPHB 2 {| 75 — 79).

Claimants state that “[i/t is simply no defense to Claimants’ fair and equitable
treatment claim for Kazakhstan to argue that its own laws were so confusing and
unclear that multiple Kazakh officials applied them incorrectly for nearly a
decade.”

 

507. Kazakh is ina oc drum. Either it unlawfully and unfairly
reclassified KPM’s and TNG’s field pipelines as trunk pipelines as a
pretext for taking over Claimants’ investments — as the evidence

overwhelmingly demonstrates — or Kazakhstan’s laws and its application
of those laws were so confusing and non-transparent that they amounted to
unfair and inequitable treatment. Either way, Kazakhstan violated the
ECT’s fair and equitable treatment standard. (C-II J 507).

Second, Claimants allege that Respondent’s prosecution “and conviction of Mr.
Cornegruta in a sham trial that also delivered a verdict against the non-party
KPM” was a violation of the FET standard. (C-I { 351, partially quoted). They
were “factually incorrect, politically motivated, and riddled with due process
violations. KPM was convicted in that proceeding, when it was not even named as
a party and could not be named a party under Kazakh law. KPM was not officially
notified of the proceeding, nor was it represented by counsel or allowed to
appeal.” Mr. Cornegruta does not own KPM and that he was not an entrepreneur
under Kazakh law. Rather, he was an employee of KPM. (C-0 {{ 44, partially
quoted; C-I { 108; CPHB 1 {| 139). In addition, Kazakhstan “failed to provide Mr.
Cornegruta access to the allegations and supporting evidence against him, and the
court summarily rejected the evidence demonstrating his innocence.” (C-II J 509).
This was an improper proceeding in the sense of Petrobart. Claimants’ expert
witnesses were compelled to withdraw their expert opinions, and “Kazakhstan's
interference in the criminal proceeding and the conviction of non-party KPM
ensured that Claimants would not have ‘a real possibility to present [their]
position’ on Mr. Cornegruta’s and KPM'’s behalf, which the Rumeli and Tecmed
tribunals deemed contrary to due process and a breach of the fair and equitable
treatment standard.” KPM was never named or made a party to the criminal action
for allegedly operating a trunk pipeline without a license, and KPM was
consequently not represented by counsel during the criminal trial against Mr.
Cornegruta. (C-0 { 46; C-I { 108). This proceeding also amounted to a denial of
justice under international law. (C-I {{ 351, partially quoted; C-II {J 508 — 511;
CPHB 1 {{{[ 188 et seg.; CPHB 2 {J 97 - 114).

Claimants argue that this judgment violated not only international norms and
standards of due process, but also violated Kazakh law and due process. The Judge
was not bound by the 18 May 2009 decision that the expert opinions were
inadmissible (a decision that Mr. Cornegruta only learned of after conviction).
Instead, the judge could evaluate their value on her own. Claimants state that
defense counsel introduced seven expert opinions explaining that the KPM
gathering system pipelines are not trunk pipelines (two of which were subsequently
withdrawn after the experts who rendered them received threatening letters from
the Financial Police). (C-I J 117; C-II {{ 300 — 305).

Kazakh law only permits recovery based on the extent of enrichment of the guilty
person. Only income unjustly earned by Mr. Cornegruta (the guilty person) could
be recovered. The damages calculation failed in numerous respects, not the least of
which that the judge refused to hear testimony from Claimants’ expert Mr.

Suleymenov (who drafted the Law on Oil) and ignored the obvious fact that the
“illegal profits” allegedly earned by Mr. Cornegruta were not profits (they were
revenues), were not earned by him (they were earned by KPM), and did not
correspond to sums earned through operation of a pipeline (they were simply total
revenues earned by KPM, over 99% of which corresponded to onward sales of oil).
There could be no recovery from KPM and Kazakhstan identifies no provision of
Kazakh law supporting its notion that Mr. Cornegruta’s purported unjust
enrichment amounted to all of KPM’s revenues. There is also no theory of “quasi-
criminal” liability in Kazakh law. (CPHB 2 ff 86, 97 — 109).

The threats against KPM and TNG’s employees that they would face similar trials
to Mr. Cornegruta if they did not cooperate and the Financial Police’s efforts to
follow and intimidate Mr. Cornegruta’s wife and lawyers outside of court violate
the FET standard. (CPHB 2 {{{[ 49 — 51).

Third, “Kazakhstan’s refusal to approve TNG’s contractual rights to continue
exploration in the 302 Contract Properties comprises two distinct breaches of the
[FET] provision.” First, by simply ignoring TNG’s request for an extension for six
months, Kazakhstan violated Claimants’ right to be notified of acts or omissions
that would impact its investment. Second, Claimants’ legitimate expectations were
frustrated when Kazakhstan failed to extend the contract, despite having assured
TNG that it would do so. This “wrongful refusal to execute the addendum
extending TNG’s exploration rights in the Contract 302 Properties prevented
Claimants from proving the Contract 302 Properties’ reserves, which in turn
prevented them from establishing the market value of their Kazakh investments.”
At best, this is gross negligence. It is more likely, however, that this “/bad faith]
conduct represents deliberate interference with Claimants’ rights over their
investments, including KPM’s and TNG’s contract rights, because Kazakhstan
never communicated any change in its position to them and gave them no
justification for its refusal.” The termination also frustrated Claimants’ legitimate
expectations because they breached the contractually-mandated 90 day notice
period before termination would be effective. (C-I | 351, partially quoted; C-II {{
514, 516; CPHB 2 {fi 149 — 176).

Fourth, Claimants allege that Kazakhstan “saddl[ed] KPM and TNG with
ownership and title concerns that destroyed Claimants’ ability to dispose of their
investments at market value” and that this was a violation of the FET standard.
Kazakhstan acted inconsistently and without transparency by “continually
changing its position on KPM’s and TNG’s transfer prices, corporate taxes, export
tax exemptions, amortization rates, the extension of TNG’s exploration period, and
the State’s pre-emptive rights. The imposition of clearly improper tax rates is
tantamount to extortion.” In particular, Kazakhstan incorrectly assessed USD 6
million in back transfer price taxes and penalties against the companies. In effect,
and in the sense of CME y. Czech Republic ruling, this eviscerated the
arrangements that induced the Claimants to invest, and upon which Claimants
relied. Furthermore, in violation of specific contractual and legal provisions that
exempted KPM from paying export taxes, KPM was prohibited from exporting
22,000 tonnes of crude oil without paying the tax. KPM paid, under protest, and
has legally challenged these actions. Claimants’ characterization of the tax issues
are best taken from their own words:

912.

913.

915.

Page 201 of 414

The State then introduced a new tax provision that replaced crude oil export taxes
with a Rent Tax for Export. When a court decision exempted KPM from paying the
Crude Oil Export Tax for its January 2009 exports, but instead obliged KPM to
pay the newly applicable Rent Tax for Export, the Financial Police intervened.
The Aktau territorial customs body subsequently informed KPM that it was
required to pay the Crude Oil Export Tax, amounting to USD 4 million, which led
to KPM filing additional legal challenges. The Financial Police’s interference in
KPM’s and TNG’s contractual relationship with the Ministry amounts to a
violation of Kazakhstan's duty to treat Claimants’ investments fairly and equitably.
The changes of opinion with respect to export taxes also frustrated Claimants’
legitimate expectations that that they would benefit from a contractually agreed tax
exemption. (C-I 351).

In addition, “Kazakhstan also refused to refund US$ 10 million that KPM and TNG
paid under protest, after those taxes were found to have been improper.” (C-II {
514). The three tax claims — the USD 10 million for export duties, the USD 62
million for corporate income taxes, and the USD 5 million in transfer pricing taxes
were structured in such that they were, in Ros/nvest’s words, “linked to the
strategic objective of returning petroleum assets to the control of the [State] and in
an effort to suppress the [an investor].’ The Tribunal should conclude that
Respondent’s actions have breached the FET standard. (CPHB 2 {| 127 — 139).

Inconsistently and non-transparently, Kazakhstan raised questions as to the true
ownership of TNG and clouded Terra Raf’s title when, on 18 December 2008, it
retroactively revoked its prior, express consent for the transfer of TNG’s ownership
from Gheso to Terra Raf and its prior waiver of pre-emptive rights. It is now
common ground that Kazakhstan did not have a pre-emptive right in 2003, when
Gheso transferred TNG to Terra Raf. Even throughout this arbitration, Respondent
has shifted its arguments. When Kazakhstan argued that the Gheso-Terra Raf
transfer was not valid until it was registered, Claimants proved that it was
registered in May 2003 and was, therefore, complete. When Kazakhstan then
argued that the 2003 transfer was not complete until the relevant Kazakh
authorities consented to it, Claimants showed that Kazakh law did not require
consent to be complete in 2003 and that Respondent consented to the transfer in
2007. The manner in which Respondent protested the transfer and then made false
public claims of fraud and forgery, which immediately clouded title to TNG,
violated the FET standard. (CPHB 2 {f[ 115 — 126).

All of these measures furthered the State’s goal, expressed in 2008, to take over
Claimants’ investments, as these measures prevented Claimants from selling their
investments. (C-I {| 351, C-II { 513).Claimants state that Kazakhstan does not
dispute that harassment and coercion of an investor constitutes a breach of the FET
provision. Kazakhstan initiated a campaign of harassment and coercion that
endured for 21 months. This campaign was carried out in bad faith, for the purpose
of acquiring Claimants’ investments at firesale prices. (C-II {{{[ 512 — 513, partially
quoted).

Fifth, Respondent “fabricat[{ed] the grounds for the direct seizures of Claimants’
investments in July 2010” and that this was a violation of the FET standard. Taken
from Claimants’ own words:

Page 202 of 414

[...] The eleventh-hour allegations of breach were utterly without merit. For
example, the Ministry of Oil and Gas raised its tired claim that TNG operated a
main pipeline without a license as a ground for claiming breach of TNG’s Contract
No. 302, even though that contract for exploration in the area surrounding the
Tabyl Block had nothing at all to do with KPM’s or TNG’s gathering systems. The
Ministry later admitted that the violations it had alleged only days before were not
the reasons for terminating Contract No. 302. (C-I {[ 351):

Even if Respondent’s allegations had been meritorious, they still violated the FET
provision because Claimants were not given a meaningful opportunity to dispute or
correct the alleged violations. The burdensome taxes and criminal prosecution
described above, as well as the multiple inspections, raids, and interrogations of
Claimants’ personnel, “destroyed the ability of KPM and TNG to operate
normally” and that was a violation of the FET standard. The asset seizures
following the conviction forced KPM and TNG to spend valuable time and
resources challenging the orders and protecting their business. Finally, the bad
faith seizure, culminating “the State’s months-long, self-serving scheme to gain
control and nationalize those investments [...] included the takeover of all of
Claimants’ investments in Kazakhstan. In no way can the seizure of Claimants’
investments be in accord with Kazakhstan’s duty to treat Claimants’ investments

fairly and equitably.” (C-T{ 351).

Sixth, Claimants filed dozens of complaints to various Kazakh authorities about the
mistreatment they were suffering. Every plea fell upon deaf ears. The Tribunal
could consider this bureaucratic blame shuffling and ultimate non-reaction to be a
violation of the FET standard, as the Tribunal in Wena Hotels v. Egypt found when
it considered that Egypt’s failure to take any action to prevent illegal action by state
authorities constituted just such a violation. (CPHB 2 {| 140 — 148).

Regarding the content of the Cliffson deal, Claimants present that during
negotiations they made it clear that they intended to bring an arbitration against
Kazakhstan for the diminution in value of the investment once the sale closed.
They explain that they only agreed to drop the arbitration amendment in exchange
for “the family’s” use of their influence to obtain the release of Mr. Cornegruta
from prison. (C-II {392 — 395).

Each action describe above violates every element of the UNCTAD’s description
of abusive conduct that violates the FET standard. (CPHB 2 {| 58).

2. Arguments by Respondent

Throughout its dealings with KPM and TNG, Respondent has acted in a manner
that was consistent with the expectations of investors and consistent with any
legitimate expectations that KPM and TNG could reasonably have had. Claimants’
attempt to argue that Respondent’s adherence to due process is part of a so-called
“strategy of obstructionism” is a figment of Claimants’ imagination. (R-II {| 990 —
991). Regardless, Respondent has treated Claimants and their investments fairly
and equitably. As far as the typical elements of FET, Respondent agrees with the
facts that Claimants’ list at C-I {| 345 (protection against actions in bad faith, the
protection of legitimate expectations, the reliance on a stable and predictable
business environment, the expectation of due process and the protection against
interference with contractual relationships, harassment or coercive conduct).

Respondent reminds the Tribunal, that it must assess each allegation on a case-by-
case basis, and none of the above factors, alone, is sufficient for a finding that of a
breach of the FET standard. (R-I {| 37.32 — 37.34). Respondent’s position is best
taken from its own words:

993. [The FET standard] needs to be considered against all the factual
circumstances. In a situation where the state action that the injured party
claims of is one which the aggrieved party has been granted a right to
resolve at a local level, there can be no conclusion that the state has acted
unfairly and inequitably if the aggrieved party has not actually pursued
those rights. In other words, a state (acting fairly and equitably) may
provide an opportunity (through the provision of contractual protection or
through the court system) for the claimant to seek redress of actions taken
by the state that may have been incorrect. This might apply to a decision of
a first instance court or the actions of an administrative official. This is a
fundamental part of providing a fair and equitable as well as stable and
predictable environment for the investment. As set out in Helnan v Egypt, a
treaty claim for the breach of fair and equitable treatment is likely to be
less successful where the claimant has not been able to show that the
system of investment protection in the host state has been unfair and
inequitable vis-a-vis the aggrieved party.

994. Claimants say that Helnan v Egypt does not support this contention. This
is incorrect. The basic principle in international law is that the parties
should exhaust local law remedies first prior to pursing rights through
diplomatic protection. In investor-state arbitration as_a_matter_of
jurisdiction, the exhaustion of local remedies is often not required since the
parties agree in advance to resolve their disputes through arbitration.
Therefore, this rule is dispensed with unless the parties agree otherwise.

995. However, the Republic’s argument here is not (as Claimants seem to
suggest) a question of jurisdiction, nor that the “exhaustion of local
remedies” as such is required. Rather, this situation concerns
circumstances where the claimant alleges that certain domestic laws have
been breached, and that accordingly, the standard of fair and equitable
treatment has been not been met. The Republic’s contention is that the
claimants have not established that a breach of the standard of fair and
equitable treatment (judged at an international level) has occurred simply
by alleging that there have been breaches of law at a domestic level. This
is all the more the case when there are available to the claimant, avenues
of recourse which have not in fact been pursued. [...] this is precisely the
case here. (R-II {Jf 993 — 996, citations omitted, emphasis maintained).

Claimants have not pursued remedies against the Republic, and this bars their
claims. Instead, Claimants “dismiss [...] this issue as if it were a minor technical
hitch and quickly go on to simply reiterate their grievances against the Republic.”
There is no legal basis recovery. In cases where there is an available remedy — via
domestic law or through a contractual forum selection clause — the investor has a
right to resolve a dispute. The granting of such a mechanism, if it works properly,
must be considered as an action of the host state that is favorable to the investor
and is aimed at ensuring a FET. If an investor fails to pursue such remedy, this
counter-acts the allegation that the host state acted unfairly or inequitably. As a

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 205 of 415

922.

923.

924.

Page 204 of 414

host state cannot always guarantee that its officials will always act in accordance
with the laws, the remedies available to rectify low level breaches are important.
The analysis of FET must take the entire legal system of the host state and
likewise, whether it was tested by the investor, into account. (R-I {{{ 37.3 — 37.12;
R-II { 997 — 999).

Other tribunals, such as Parkerings v. Lithuania, MCI v. Ecuador, and Waste
Management, have held that, in cases of a sufficient domestic system of redress
stemming from either domestic law or from the contractual forum selection clause,
failure to pursue available remedies excludes the possibility of a breach of the FET
standard. (R-I {{[ 37.12 — 37.17).

Furthermore, despite asserting that “dozens of treaty tribunals” have found
violations in cases of “less severe” treatment, they have left unchallenged the
Republic’s observation that finding a breach of the FET standard is actually a very
high bar. There is a high measure of deference that international law extends to the
right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders. Only
cases of blatant misconduct will support a finding of unfair and inequitable
treatment. A mere breach of a host State’s domestic law is not sufficient. The
ECT, interpreted with due regard for its purpose, supports a_ restrictive
understanding of FET, as an overly “investor-friendly” interpretation would
prevent host states from admitting investors. This is a highly fact-specific analysis
— it is simply not sufficient to “trot out” examples of whether other tribunals may
have come to a finding that helps Claimants’ arguments. (R-I {{[ 37.24 — 37.31; R-
TI 4 997 — 1000).

Initially, Claimants cited the following nine instances where they alleged
Respondent breached the FET standard:

(a) The determination that KPM was operating trunk pipelines;
(b) the trial and conviction of Mr. Cornegruta and the verdict against KPM;

(c) the decision of the Republic’s authorities not to prolong the exploration
rights under Contract No. 302;

(d) the imposing of corporate back taxes, export duties and rent taxes as well
as the subsequent withdrawing of some tax charges;

(e) the alleged revocation of the Republic’s purported consent to the transfer
of TNG to Terra Raf;

ip the series of inspections and audits in 2008 and 2010;
(g) the seizure of KPM'’s assets based on the verdict against KPM;
(h) the termination of KPM’s and TNG’s contracts, allegedly without giving

enough time to respond and without keeping the contractually agreed
notice period;

925.

926.

927.

Page 205 of 414

(i) the taking into trust management of KPM’s and TNG’s assets after the
termination of the contracts. (R-I J 37.19).

The actions listed under (c), (d), and (h) arise out of the Subsoil Use Contracts and
Contract 302. The contractual remedy in respect of those allegations has not been
pursued, and Claimants are therefore barred from invoking these allegations. The
remaining allegations fail because Claimants have not pursued available domestic
remedies for them to their full extent. (R-I {{[ 37.20 — 37.21).

Over 100 enterprises hold licenses to operate trunk pipelines. (R-I { 21.12). The
term “trunk pipeline” is defined in Art. 14 of the Law on Oil, pursuant to which
pipelines are classified according to how they operate. A trunk or main pipeline is
an engineering structure intended for transportation of commercial oil (prepared in
accordance with the requirements of technical regulations) from the points of
intake (from Contractor’s pipeline) to the places of: (a) transshipment to a different
means of transport; (b) processing; (c) consumption; or (d) storage. (R-I {| 21.7).
The length of a pipeline is irrelevant for the classification. The KPM Pipeline is
not a gathering main mode pipeline (which would be excluded from the definition
of “trunk pipeline”). Further, the KPM Pipeline shares oil with other contractors.
Respondent states that the 1 km piece of pipeline at issue is located outside of the
Contract Area, making it a trunk pipeline. (R-I {J 23 — 24; R-II {J 519 — 541).
With respect to Claimants’ comparisons between the KPM and the KazTurkMunai
pipelines, Respondent finds this futile, since Claimants have not proven any like
features between the two. Further, they have not established that the
KazTurkMunai has a license for a trunk pipeline. (R-II 545).

Each of the four instances upon which Claimants now focus (rather than the six
initially alleged) fails for two reasons: “Firstly, each is a case where Claimants
could have and should have pursued the issue further using the official systems put
in place by the Republic. Secondly, Claimants misconstrue the facts to create a
distorted and fictional picture in their favour.” (R-II § 1001). Respondent’s
arguments are best taken from its own words:

1002. Claimants allege that the “reclassification” of the KPM Pipeline breached
fair and equitable standards. [...] Claimants have misconstrued the events
that comprised the Financial Police’s inspection and investigation of the
pipeline issue, suggesting, wrongly that the Republic had premeditated the
outcome that resulted in the prosecution of Mr. Cornegruta on behalf of
KPM. In any case, there was no “reclassification” and therefore it is not
possible that this activity was unfair or inequitable. The pipeline was
always a trunk pipeline.

[The conclusion that the at-issue pipelines were indeed trunk pipelines is
both legally and factually correct. The Parties’ witnesses agreed on the
legal definition of a trunk pipeline, which is provided in the Law on Oil.
(RPHB 2 1] 219 — 236).]

1003. The Financial Police’s inspection and investigation was carried out in
accordance with due process and the laws prevailing at the time. The
classification of pipelines is a legal question and one that in the case of a
dispute should be resolved by reference to the judicial authorities. As such,
classification decisions are not finally determined by industry specialists,

1004.

1005.

1006.

Page 206 of 414

technical court experts in pipeline design, the MEMR, ARNM, or, for that
matter, TNG or KPM. Moreover, the Financial Police is not a competent
authority for the classification of pipelines, nor as it ever held itself out to
be such. This is why the Financial Police spent a number of months in late
2008 and early 2009 collating the necessary evidence regarding the
pipeline and its operation by KPM. [see also R-II J 457]

Claimants suggest that the Republic admits that its laws are confusing,
citing reference to the Judicial Executor’s decision. This misconstrues the
Republic's assertion which was simply that the way in which the Judicial
Executor referred to the pipeline did not make it clear whether the pipeline
was trunk or field: there was no statement by the Judicial Executor that the
law was confusing. On the facts of this case, it is accepted that there were
different views as to the correct classification of the pipeline. Since the
application of the law always depends on the facts, it is not uncommon for
there to be disagreement as to whether or not a particular law does or not
apply, or how it applies. However, this does not lead to the inevitable
conclusion that the law is unclear. More importantly, it does not absolve
KPM and Mr. Cornegruta from the consequences of their illegal operation
of the KPM Pipeline. [Further, Respondent denies that the Judicial
Executor made any admission that the pipe in question was a field
pipeline. As for the argument that their licenses gave them a legitimate
expectation — the licenses only informed them of what type of pipeline they
could operate. The license did not tell them what pipes they were actually
operating. None of the licenses have ever been sufficient for the pipelines
Claimants were actually operating. (R-I 1] 37.36 — 37.41)]

Claimants continue to contend that Mr. Cornegruta’s conviction and the
recovery of income from KPM was contrary to fair and equitable treatment
standards. For the reasons set out in Section C.VI to C.VIIL, this is not the
case. In any event, Mr. Cornegruta could have appealed any decision
against him to the Supreme Court. Similarly, KPM had an opportunity to
challenge the recovery order and failed to do this within the correct time
limits. Since he did not, Claimants are not now entitled to complain that
the Republic’s treatment of him was unfair. [Further, nothing in this
proceeding constituted a “denial of justice”, as alleged by Claimants.
There was nothing shocking to judicial propriety. The decision was
consistent with domestic law and accorded with international standards.
Further, the calculation of illegal profit was correct and in accordance
with the law (although even if it were incorrect, more than incorrectness is
required to bring that into a treaty violation. (R-I 37.38; 37.42 —
37.50); RPHB 2 Jf 151 — 218, 265 - 271)]

In relation to the “harassment and coercion campaign” there simply was
no such campaign against KPM or Claimants. [...] In any case,
Claimants’ case is contradictory. On the one hand, they say that there was
a “Playbook” employed by the Republic and wheeled out against
systemically every foreign investor. At the same time, they argue that the
campaign was unfair. At the very least, it must be recognised that if there
was such a “Playbook” that was employed by the Republic (which is

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 208 of 415

928.

929.

Page 207 of 414

denied), its employment cannot, by definition, be “unfair” or
“inequitable”.

1007. Finally, with regard to the non-extension of Contract 302, Claimants’
allegations equally amount to zero. It is not correct that the Republic ever
agreed to an extension of the contract or that Claimants could rely on such
an extension being granted. That is because the process for an agreement
had simply not been gone through. The document that Claimants rely on
as “proof” of a promise to extend the contract was a mere intermediate
step in the process of reaching an agreement. It could not cause any
reliance on the part of Claimants. Rather, the simple fact that no extension
was agreed and signed created all the legal security that Claimants could
expect, though to a different effect as they may have hoped for. [see also
RPHB 2 {ff 282 — 305]

1008. Claimants’ further arguments with regard to the termination of Contract
302 are downright confusing. Claimants seem to allege that the MOG’s
notice of infringement of obligations prior to the contract termination
somehow created reliance on the side of Claimants that the contract would
be extended. It should be self-explanatory that a statement noting contract
infringements cannot create any expectation of contract extension. (R-II 1]
1002 — 1008, partially quoted; see also R-I {J 37.35 — 37.52).

Regarding the criminal proceedings, Respondent states that the Aktau court was
asked to rule on whether Mr. Cornegruta, on behalf of KPM, was guilty under Art.
190(2)(b) of the Criminal Code of the Republic. (R-II { 498). Respondent states
that Mr. Cornegruta was the General Manager of KPM and, as such the most senior
executive of that company. Given Mr Cornegruta’s position within KPM, it was
trite that he would in theory carry responsibility under law for any criminal activity
of KPM. (R-II { 510). Respondent rejects Claimants’ characterization that this was
a trial of Mr. Cornegruta. Strictly, it was the trial of KPM, at which Mr.
Cornegruta was its representative. (R-I {{[ 27.50, 27.54, 27.57). Respondent
explained that the necessity of arresting Mr. Cornegruta arose because other
potentially liable individuals, including Mr. Cojin, Mr. Spasov, and Mr. Salagar,
had already left the country. (RPHB | {{ 230).

Respondent denies Claimants’ contention that KPM was not criminally indicted. It
is admitted that no civil action had been brought against KPM. It is admitted that
KPM was ordered to pay 21,675,854,578 Tenge, based on the assessment of the
income received by KPM as a result of its illegal entrepreneurial activity dated 18
May 2009. It is not admitted that the sum constitutes all of KPM’s oil and gas
production revenues from March 2007 — May 2008. It is not admitted whether
KPM had already paid taxes on such income. However, to the extent that taxes had
been paid on that income, it is apparent that KPM neglected to provide evidence of
this to the court. It is not admitted whether the above sum bears any relationship to
transportation fees earned by a trunk pipeline operator or whether such fees
represent the sole income of such an operator. However, the relevance of these
assertions to the computation of the sums KPM was obliged to pay is denied. (R-I]]
27.59). Claimants’ criticism that the recovery was disproportionate misses the
mark: the goal is to address and negate the unjust enrichment that results from the
crime, not to punish the crime. The unjust enrichment is not limited to the
hypothetical income for providing crude oil transportation services. Squire

Sanders assessed the amount subject to recovery to be reasonably over USD
80,000,000. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 262 — 264).

[Respondent’s prosecution of Mr. Cornegruta on behalf of KPM and _ the
subsequent appeal were conducted in a lawful manner that adhered to Kazakh and
international standards of due process. Mr. Cornegruta examined evidence,
requested further evidence, and had the advice of qualified counsel. While some of
his motions were not granted, others were. He had the opportunity to ask questions
of witnesses and only those experts whose evidence was admitted pursuant to Art.
243 CPC were heard. With respect to the refusal to allow Claimants’ so-called
experts to testify, since their testimony was outside of Art. 243, it would not have
attracted evidentiary weight in any event. (RPHB 2 {| 237 — 242).] Respondent
denies that the Financial Police threatened any of KPM’s experts and states that
there were 5, not 7, experts. (R-I {ff 27.52, 27.57). The State introduced a single
expert opinion containing a statement that the KPM gathering system pipelines
trunk pipelines. Respondent admits that the prosecutor relied on a single expert
opinion, dated 13 February 2009. (R-I {{ 27.57). Respondent states that the Judge
considered evidence presented by KPM, but found it to be unpersuasive. (R-I {
27.57).

Respondent maintains that the executive branch did not interfere with the trial.
Claimants have produced little more than conjecture to support this contention.
While it is true that the initial inspection was connected with the President’s
instructions, instructions did not lead to the conviction of Mr. Cornegruta. A
proper review of the chronology of events reveals that the process, if anything, was
bottom up, starting with the inspection of KPM and TNG’s pipelines and ending in
the prosecution, following due process. The rejection of the Mr. Cornegruta’s
expert opinions — first by the Financial Police, and then separately by the Judge in
Aktau, was also according to due process. Mr. Baymaganbetov’s expert report and
the Court’s use of Mr. Cornegruta’s “confession” letter were proper. (R-II {| 628 —
634; R-I {| 27).

Claimants never exhausted the appeals system within the Republic, which stood
open to Claimants. KPM missed the deadline to appeal. It was the Court’s view
that KPM had notice of the decision against it, since its senior management was
present at the hearing. (R-II { 635 — 638).

The termination of the contracts and the seizure of KPM and TNG’s assets were in
accordance with due process. The terminations were based on breaches of those
contracts, including non-fulfillment of work programs. Claimants had the
opportunity to dispute or correct the Republic’s arguments. Claimants were
involved in the inspection process, they were aware of the breaches, they provided
inadequate responses to the Notices of Breach, and they never requested additional
time to prepare fuller responses. Regardless, even if there was no due process, this
would not change the fact that the Republic could validly terminate the contracts
and that Claimants, thus, stood to lose their contractual rights. It was Respondent’s
substantive right to terminate the contract in light of Claimants’ misbehavior and
that caused Claimants’ losses. The seizure was legal under Kazakh law and was
necessary for the continued gas production of the region. (R-I {{{[ 37.59 — 37.64;
RPHB 2 {{{[ 339 — 374).

Respondent states, in response to paragraph 11 of Mr. Calancea’s Witness
Statement, that the Republic would never have been in a position to compensate
Claimants for the transfer. (R-II 708). The transfer did not involve a transfer in
title. (R-I { 31.162). Accordingly, KMG NC’s role was clearly as trust manager
and therefore it had no business in taking on the debts and liabilities, which
remained with KPM and TNG. (R-II 711).

Claimants’ allegations regarding the tax assessments fail in their entirety, as they
were also in compliance with domestic law. Claimants could not legitimately
expect anything except a lawful tax assessment, or that there would not be back
assessments in the event of an incorrect tax declaration. (R-I {{{[ 37.53 — 37.55).

As for the transfer from TNG to Terra Raf, the alleged reversal does not harm
Claimants’ legitimate expectations, as the application for the alleged approval was
based on a flawed and inaccurate application. (R-I {37.56 — 37.57; RPHB 2 {{{]
272-281).

Respondent’s investigations were at all times lawful. Thus, the argument cannot
stand that these investigations and proceedings — brought on by Claimants’ own
illegal behavior — can be the basis for a claim of unfair and inequitable treatment.
Claimants always had a duty to apply for the appropriate licenses for their work,
and even upon being notified that their application was incomplete, they chose not
to. (R-I{ 37.58; RPHB 2 {fff 151 — 218).

Claimants’ argument that Respondent forced Mr. Cojin and Mr. Cornegruta to sign
inspection protocols after the MEMR’s 4 — 11 November 2008 inspection is only
supported by the incredible testimony of Mr. Cojin. After the hearing, Respondent
explained that, while initially Mr. Cojin had stated that he accompanied the
Financial Police on behalf of TNG, he admitted in cross-examination that he did
not actually attend the inspection. Respondent argues that, since Mr. Cojin has
testified dishonestly, there is no proof that he was forced to sign the inspection
protocols. Not even the minutes of the meeting signed by Mr. Cojin or Mr.
Cornegruta reflect this event. (RPHB 1 {| 194 — 196; RPHB 2 {ff 157 - 161). ,

At the Hearing on Quantum, Claimants alleged that the gas market in Kazakhstan
amounts to a violation of the FET standard. Respondent states that Claimants are
seeking not fair, but rather preferential treatment, something that is not guaranteed.
Claimants received the same treatment as other investors and when they did not
receive special treatment, they felt persecuted. The Republic was under no
obligation to create or find a market for Claimants’ oil and gas. The Republic
reserves the right to submit further submission on this point. (RPHB | {[[ 612 —
618, 698 — 700).

Respondent states that Claimants’ statements about the contract negotiations with
Cliffson, especially those related to the investment arbitration clauses, are beyond

Respondent’s knowledge. (R-II { 827).

3. The Tribunal

To a large extent, the Parties seem to be in agreement regarding the abstract
definition of what fair and equitable treatment (FET) is and intends to protect. In

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 211 of 415

942.

943.

944.

945.

946.

947.

Page 210 of 414

particular, they agree that the host state has to act in a manner that is consistent
with the legitimate expectations of investors.

In view of the breadth of the terms “fair” and “equitable,” their context in the ECT,
and the object and purpose of the ECT, the Tribunal has to interpret the FET
standard in the ECT. The two terms as such provide little guidance. The VCLT,
however, provides such guidance:

. Art. 31.1 requires an interpretation of a treaty provision in their context
and in the light of its object and purpose,

. Art. 31.2 requires an interpretation of the purpose of a treaty including its
preamble and annexes, and

. Art. 32 allows recourse to supplementary means of interpretation.

In the latter context, the Tribunal may take into account that the FET standard has
been interpreted and applied under international law by many international
investment tribunals, thereby creating a considerable body of case law that has
added specific meaning and content to the standard.

But the Parties also seem to agree, and the Tribunal agrees as well, that the FET
standard needs to be considered against all of the factual circumstances. Indeed, the
application of the FET standard can only be case specific, taking into account:

. the specific factual circumstances of the present case, and
. that these have to be evaluated in the present case in the legal context of
the ECT.

In view of this approach, the Tribunal will now first consider the factual
circumstances by summarizing the Respondent’s conduct vis-d-vis Claimants’
investment insofar as it is considered relevant. In doing so, the Tribunal considers
that, at least in the present case, as the term “treatment” already indicates, not one
particular action by the host state has to be considered, but rather Respondent’s
“treatment” of Claimants’ investment over a longer period allows its legal
evaluation. In view of that, above in this Award, the Tribunal has included a
detailed timetable of all relevant actions of the Parties.

Regarding the events and steps of the Parties from the beginning of contacts in
1997 to 6 October 2008, the Tribunal refers to the timetable recorded above in a
separate section of this Award. It needs not to be summarized or repeated here and
shows what the Tribunal considers, with some exceptions described below, to be a
normal sequence of contacts and cooperation between the Claimants and
Respondent regarding the investments made. It provides no indication that
Respondent considered major aspects of the investment or the conduct of the
investors as illegal or that it intended to bring the investment to an end.

Hereafter, the Tribunal describes in detail the treatment after the above date, which
in its view is relevant for the alleged breach of the FET standard.

On 6 October 2008, Mr. Vladimir Voronin ("Voronin"), then-President of
Moldova, wrote to Mr. Nursultan Nazarbayev, the President of Kazakhstan
("President Nazarbayev"). There is some indirect evidence (based on an unverified
24 January 2011 Moldovan television interview transcript) that President
Nazarbayev may have requested that Voronin, at a meeting of CSI, provide him
information about Anatolie Stati. (C-78). Respondent denies every allegation that
President Nazarbayev asked Voronin for the letter as a pretext to any investigation,
and disputes the translation of the interview — an interview where the name “Stati”
was not even mentioned. (R-I Jf 18, 19.21; RPHB | { 375). The Tribunal,
however, need not decide whether the content or translations of the interview, as
presented by either side, are accurate in order to reach the conclusions, below.

The 6 October 2008 Voronin letter (C-77), in the interest of “‘strengthen[ing] trust
[and] develop[ing] relations free of any suspicious businessmen,” informed
President Nazarbayev that Anatolie Stati conceals profits from the states where he
has earned them and even “use/s] of his profits from the deposits in Kazakhstan for
investments in areas, for example, in Southern Sudan, that are subject to sanctions
by international organizations, in particular the U.N.” The letter warns that this
activity is damaging to the reputations of both Kazakhstan (as the state where
Anatolie Stati earns his income) and Moldova (as “the state of origin of the
businessman”). The letter also accuses Anatolie Stati of “interfere[ing] with the
development of the external and personnel policy of Moldova, creating a corrupt
lobby of supporters of the trade agreements concluded with states subject to the
U.N. sanctions.” (C-77, R-II { 277).

What is undisputed is that, expressly based on the letter from President Voronin,
President Nazarbayev issued an Order dated 14/16 October 2008 to the Kazakh
Deputy Prime Minister, U. Sukeev, and the head of the Agency of the Republic of
Kazakhstan for Fighting Economic and Corruption Crimes (the "Financial Police"),

S. Kalmurzaev (“the Order ”). (C-8). The Order used the terms "/aJt the request of
the Moldovan party,” to "thoroughly check company's work and to take decision on
its further work in the ‘est interests of the country." (C-II { 213; R-II 283; RPHB
1 { 1162; C-8 (partially quoted); Tr. Hr. 1 Day 1 Opening by Tirado (R) p. 35;
Opening by Smith (C) pp. 94, 155; Mynbaev Day 3 p. 86).At approximately the
same time as the Nazarbayev Order, on 14 October 2008, TNG notified the MEMR
of its intention to exercise its contractual right to extend the exploration period by
two further years pursuant to Contract 302. Among other things, this application
refers to the “/dJiscovery of new HC deposits on depths of over 5-6 km...” and
“large deeply submerged reef fields...” (C-67, partially quoted). The Claimants
say these are unmistakable references to the Interoil Reef structure and that this
application further indicated TNG's plans to complete the Munaibay-1 well. (C-I {|
67; CPHB 1 {{ 129, 234 — 235; CPHB 2 {| 151; R-I { 31.68; R-II | 416; C-66; C-67;
Lungu Tr. January 2013 Day | pp. 250 — 251). Prior to filing, On 24 July 2008,
TNG informed the Geology and Subsoil Use Committee of the MEMR that it had
discovered an oil and gas field by drilling the Munaibay-1 well in the Contract 302
area. Anatolie Stati testified that during the summer of 2008, TNG purchased a
more robust drilling rig in Georgia with the intention of resuming the completion
of the Munaibay-1 well and further exploration of the Contract 302 area. (Tr.
January 2013 Hearing Day 2 pp. 84, 114— 115). On 11 August 2008, TNG applied
to move to the appraisal phase for Munaibay. TNG withdrew the appraisal

application on 10 October 2008 because it believed it was too early to begin
appraisal. (C-0 {| 57; C-I | 67; CPHB 1 {{ 129; 234; CPHB 2 { 151; C-66).

Shortly after it was issued, President Nazarbayev's instruction came to the attention
of Major A. Rakhimov of the Financial Police ("Major Rakhimov"). In his
testimony, he acknowledged that he had never received a personal directive from
the President of Kazakhstan previously. (Rakhimov Day 5 pp. 81 — 83).

On 16 October 2008, the Deputy Prime Minister issued Order No. 6497 and,
shortly thereafter, the Financial Police ordered the commencement of numerous
audits and investigations of Anatolie Stati, KPM, and TNG (R-II {{ 283),
summarized by reference to the following events:

On 18 October 2008, the Financial Police wrote to the Customs Committee to
enquire about Anatolie Stati's travel through Kazakhstan. (C-11).

By correspondence dated 20 October 2008, the Financial Police requested the
Kazakh State Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources ("MEMR") to investigate
Anatolie Stati and his companies and to provide “/cJopies of contracts, working
schedules, LKU reports as well as the set of documents for obtaining the license,”
as well as “/iJnformation on the volume of extractions and investments at the
closing date of the contracts.” (C-9). An internal request was also made for Mr.
Turganbayev to provide information regarding Anatolie Stati’s activities in
Kazakhstan and off shore. (C-444).

On 24 October 2008, the Financial Police ordered the Tax Committee of the
Ministry of Finance (the "Tax Committee") to conduct comprehensive or complex
tax audits of KPM, TNG, and Kok Mai, which commenced on 28 October, 10
November, and 18 November 2008, respectively. Members of the Financial Police
were to be included in the Tax Committee. (C-10).

On 24 October 2008, Mr. Turganbayev requested a prolongation of the inspection
until 16 December 2008. (WS Turganbayev 2 {[ 4.8; C-430).

On 28 October 2008 the Financial Police ordered the Committee of Geology and
Subsoil Resources Use of the MEMR to commence an audit of KPM’s and TNG's
compliance with their subsoil use licenses and to involve the Financial Police in the
audit. (CPHB {[ 38; WS Turganbayev 2 {ff 4.1 — 4.2).

By Order dated 28 October 2008, the Financial Police directed the Committee for
Ecology Regulation and Control for the Ministry for Environmental Protection (the
"Ecology Committee") to organize the inspection of KPM’s and TNG's compliance
with "rational" subsoil exploitation and petroleum operations (including burning
gas over allowed limits) and to include members of the Financial Police in the
inspection committee. (C-13; R-I {| 26.8).

On 30 October 2008, the Financial Police reported that Anatolie Stati was not a
registered businessman in Kazakhstan, but carried on business through Ascom
which, in turn, owned KPM. (C-366).

On 30 October 2008, the Financial Police reported on KPM's and TNG's activities,
noting specific items to inspect, but finding that KPM and TNG were in
compliance with all of their investment obligations. (C-438).

By correspondence dated 31 October 2008, the MES reported to the Financial
Police on scheduling the examination of KPM's and TNG's compliance with
industrial safety legislation for the years 2006 and 2007. (C-14).

Kemikal, which was TNG’s largest non-local customer, which was under the
control of the son-in-law of President Nazarbayev, Mr. Timur Kulibayev, through
intervening entities he was said to control, namely, Gaz Impex and KazRosGas.
Mr. Kulibayev was also the Chairman of KMG. In the Fall of 2008, Kemikal,
failed to post bank guarantees that were part of its required payment terms.
Claimants state that, because Kemikal had an erratic payment history, TNG chose
not to renew that contract without the bank guarantees in place (and in fact, ended
up pursuing Kemikal until June of 2009 to acquire the last of Kemikal’s overdue
payments). TNG approached KazRosGas about purchasing its excess gas for
export, but KazRosGas never responded. (C-II { 382; R-II {J 751 - 752).

On | November 2008, the Financial Police reported to the Deputy Prime Minister,
confirming the ownership of KPM, TNG, and Kok Mai and informing him that
inspections were being carried out. The letter also informed him that, based on the
inspection, it had been ascertained that Anatolie Stati had left Kazakhstan on 29
March 2007. (CPHB 2 {[ 38, C-600).

On 7 November 2008, the Tax Committee ordered a targeted audit of KPM and
TNG regarding transfer pricing. Although the Respondent does not admit that the
audit was instructed by the Financial Police, correspondence from the Tax
Committee to the Financial Police, dated 11 November 2008 appears to
acknowledge that such was the case. (C-38).

On 7 November 2008, Anatolie Stati sent a letter to President Nazarbayev assuring
him that there was no reason to investigate KPM and TNG. (C-700). The President
did not reply.

On 7 November 2008, the Financial Police ordered the Customs Committee to
inspect KPM and TNG for compliance with payment of export duties. (C-440).

The comprehensive tax audits of KPM and TNG began on 10 November 2008. The
audits covered the period from 1 January 2005 through 31 December 2007 for
KPM, and 1 January 2003 through 31 December 2007 for TNG. The audits
pertained to corporate income tax, royalties, individual income tax, social tax,
property tax, land tax, tax on vehicles, excise taxes, corporate income tax on non-
resident legal entities, and payment for use of natural and other resources.
Respondent does not admit that the audit was instructed by the Financial Police,
although C-38 shows that the Tax Committee disclosed information relating to the
audit at the request of the Financial Police. (R-I ff 30.48, 30.62; RPHB 1| {| 1062;
C-38; C-149; C-150).

From 4 to 11 November 2008, pursuant to Art. 37 of the Law on Oil and Art. 51 of
the Law on Subsoil Use, the Geology Committee of the MEMR, with the

involvement of the Financial Police, carried out an inspection of KPM and TNG
regarding compliance with legislation on industrial safety and their licenses. (R-I {|
26.8; R-II { 455; RPHB 1 { 192, RPHB 2 {{ 157; WS Turganbayev 2 {[ 4.2; C-86;
C-87; C-14; C-439). Claimants state that the MEMR found that KPM and TNG
were in compliance with their obligations. (C-I [ 89, CPHB 2 {If 38, 61; C-86; C-
87).

On 12 November 2008, following the site visit, Mr. Turganbayev of the Financial
Police asked the ARNM whether KPM, TNG, and Kok Mai held licenses for trunk
pipelines. (R-I {[ 26.9; R-II {| 464 — 465 (stating 14 November); RPHB | {| 198 —
202; WS Turganbayev 2 {[ 5.1; C-441).

The Transfer Price Audit commenced on 12 November 2008. (R-II {| 407, WS
Rahimgaliev {{f[ 10.5, 10.6).

On 12 November 2008, the Financial Police ordered the Customs Committee to
inspect KPM's and TNG's import/export volumes. (C-442).

On 13 November 2008, the Tax Committee noted that the inclusion of the
Financial Police in inspections would be illegal and proposed that, instead, a
working group be established to review inspection results. (C-38).

On 14 November 2008, the ARNM replied to a request for clarification by Mr.
Turganbayev that KPM and TNG had each applied for, but neither held licenses to
operate main or trunk pipelines, and that the operation of a trunk pipeline required
such a license. (R-I {| 26.10; R-II {| 466; RPHB 2 { 164; WS Turganbayev {[ 5.3).

On 14 November 2008, the Financial Police met with Messrs. Cojin and
Cornegruta. The Parties dispute whether the Financial Police insisted that each
sign inspection reports admitting that KPM and TNG did not hold licenses to
operate main pipelines.

On 14 November 2008, the MEMR reported to the Financial Police on KPM's and
TNG's export volumes. (C-443).

KMG executed the 17 November 2008 Tripartite Agreement. The final signatory,
KazAzot, however, never signed.

On 17 November 2008, the Financial Police determined that the pipelines were
trunk pipelines, and then discovered that KPM and TNG did not have the necessary
licenses. Claimants refer to this as the “reclassification.” (C-II | 249; R-I {J 22.6,
23.19, 38.22; R-II ff] 451, 542; RPHB 2 {{{f 165 — 172).

On 17 November 2008, Mr. Turganbayev of the Financial Police ordered the Tax
Committee to conduct a new audit to calculate the profit that KPM and TNG
received from operating a main pipeline without a license and to determine KPM’s
revenue for onward sales of oil. (R-II { 469; RPHB 2 {{{ 172 — 173; C-89; WS
Turganbayev 2 {[ 5.4).

On 18 November 2008, the Financial Police issued a resolution for an audit of any
unpaid customs taxes by TNG. (C-446).

On 18 November 2008, the ARNM replied that TNG and KPM did not hold
licenses for trunk pipelines and that Kok Mai had never been asked about such
licenses, previously. (RPHB | {[ 198; C-88).

On 19 November 2008, the Tax Committee, at the request of the Financial Police
and based on accounting information provided by TNG, determined that the
amount of "illegal profit" from operation of the trunk pipeline was 41.8 billion
Tenge (USD 348 million as of November 2008) for KPM and 37.7 billion Tenge
(USD 314 million as of November 2008) for TNG. (R-I [ 26.19, C-202; C-450);

On 19 November 2008, the Specialized Interdistrict Court of Mangystau Region
delivered a judgment in KPM's favour in response to KPM's challenge of export
duties. The Court ruled that the imposition of KPM on the Crude Oil Expert Tax
was illegal. (R-I {| 30.56; R-II {| 743). Despite this ruling in KPM's favour, the
Financial Police and the Customs Committee challenged the ruling, resulting in
further litigation. New claims were raised against KPM and TNG. On 31 March
2010, the Customs Committee conceded that neither KPM nor TNG was obliged to
pay export duties. (C-161).

On 19 November 2008, KPM and TNG contacted the MES for a second opinion
regarding the pipelines. (R-I {{ 28.10). The MES confirmed that KPM's and TNG's
pipelines were not main pipelines, but "form a single technological process of all
production." (C-90; C-91). Respondent admits that this was the MES response, but
states that the opinion only stated that some of the pipelines were not trunk and, in
any event, the statement was outside of their competency. (R-I {{[ 26.12, 28.11 —
28.13; R-189).

On 20 November 2008, the Financial Police commenced an investigation
concerning KPM's contractual export tax exemption. (C-0 { 72).

On 21 November 2008, the Financial Police requested that the MES withdraw its
statements confirming that KPM's and TNG's pipelines were not main pipelines, on
the basis that the MES was not competent to provide that conclusion. (R-I { 26.12;
C-92; R-189).

On 25 November 2008, the Financial Police wrote to the Ministry of Finance
inquiring into why the Customs Committee "exonerate[d]" KPM from oil export
duties, given that KPM had provisionally paid the disputed duties. (C-162). The
Customs Committee had, in fact, found that KPM was not contractually obliged to
pay the export duty.

On 28 November 2008, a Ministry of Justice economics expert confirmed the Tax
Committee's calculation and concluded that KPM's illegal profits exceeded 41
billion Tenge. (R-I { 26.23, CPHB 2 {[ 81; C-452).

By a correspondence stamped with the date 28 November 2011, the National Bank
acknowledged letters from the Financial Police dated 28 October and 31 October
2008, by which the National Bank was directed to conduct exceptional inspections
and to include members of the Financial Police in the control team. The National
Bank stated that, although it could not comply with the request to include the
financial police employees among the auditors, it would issue conclusions

regarding the compliance by the companies with current legislation. The letter
informed that an extraordinary inspection of KPM had occurred, while
extraordinary inspections of TNG and Kok Mai had not occurred. (C-15).

On 2 December 2008, the Financial Police circulated an internal report confirming
that KPM operated a main pipeline without a license and had gained illegal income
of over 41 billion Tenge. (C-85).

On 10 December 2008, the Financial Police reported to the Deputy Prime Minister
that the Financial Police had determined that KPM and TNG were operating trunk
oil and gas pipelines without licenses. They stated that the Financial Police,
however, were not competent to make that decision, and reported that they had
asked the ARNM to determine what type of pipelines KPM and TNG operated,
taking their functions into account. Without a conclusion by the competent
authority “it is impossible to make a lawful procedural decision in respect of this
case.” (C-II { 220; C-448, partially quoted). Although Respondent states that “no
decision had been reached as to whether or not the pipelines were trunk at this
point” (RPHB | § 197), this statement is belied by C-448. The Tribunal believes
Respondent’s earlier statement acknowledging that the Financial Police had,
indeed, concluded that KPM and TNG were operating trunk pipelines, even though
they were not legally competent to make that classification. (R-II {{[ 473 — 474).

The Transfer Price Audit was suspended on 12 December 2008. (R-II { 407; WS
Rahimgaliev Exhibit 12).

On 15 December 2008, the Financial Police formally opened a criminal
investigation against KPM for allegedly operating a main pipeline without a
license. (CPHB | {I 168, 346; CPHB 2 {{{[ 38, 61; R-II { 294, 475, RPHB 1 {219
— 221, RPHB 2 {{{{ 177 — 180; C-632; Rakhimov Day 5 p. 20 — 21, 24-25; WS
Rakhimovy 2 {ff 3.5 — 3.8, 4.1, 4.3, 4.4). While Respondent has argued that this
investigation was opened, but not in respect to a particular person, the Tribunal
notes that KPM is expressly named in the order, which instructs “/tJo initiate the
criminal case under Article 190 Part 2 item “b” CC RK involving the illegal
entrepreneurial activity carried out by Kazpolmunai LLP and to accept it for
examination.” (RPHB 1 §] 222, C-632; Rakhimov Day 5 p. 25).

On 18 December 2008, the MEMR informed TNG that it was cancelling the State's
decision of 20 February 2007 that had further allowed the 2003 transfer of TNG
from Gheso to Terra Raf. The MEMR demanded that TNG submit a new
application for the transfer. The notice further required TNG to submit all
documentation regarding Terra Raf's ownership within 10 days, and that failure to
do so would result in the MEMR unilaterally terminating TNG's Subsoil Use
Contracts for the Tabyl Block and the Tolkyn field. (CPHB 2 {{{[ 38, 117; R-I 7
13.47; R-II [| 170 — 172; RPHB 1 {| 475 — 476; RPHB 2 fff 281, 377; C-134; C-
140; C-424; Ilyassova (12 August 2012) 7; WS Ongarbayev {[ 5.7).

The Parties are in agreement that an 18 December 2008 INTERFAX press release
alleged that the State's pre-emptive rights had been violated and indicated illegal
conduct by Terra Raf. They also agree that, on the same date, Credit Suisse sent
Mr. Lungu of Ascom a copy of the INTERFAX press release and requested an
explanation. (C-141). The Parties disagree as to where INTERFAX received its

information and whether that report is attributable to the Respondent. Respondent
argues that the accusation that the INTERFAX report was somehow attributable to
Respondent was not made contemporaneously. (R-II {| 171, see e.g. C-619; RPHB
29 7). Indeed, while Mr. Lungu initially told Credit Suisse that “there are a lot of
errors in [the INTERFAX press release] which make us believe that this info is not

from official sources,” (C-625, partially quoted), Claimants now argue that the

INTERFAX press release is attributable to Respondent, “given the level of detail in
the in the information that the INTERFAX article sources to the MEMR.” (C-II {
400; CPHB | {ff 137, 215 — 216, 347 — 348, fn. 497 (partially quoted), 350; CPHB
2 §§ 38, 117). Respondent dismissed Claimants’ argument as speculative. (R-II {]
749). It provided evidence that the information did not originate in the Republic,
including a 21 June 2012 letter from INTERFAX indicating that an inofficial
source was used (R-264) and a 21 June 2012 letter from the MEMR that it did not
provide the information (R-265). (RPHB 2 {[[ 7, 95 — 99). Respondent denies that
the report was from official sources and Mr. Ongarbayev denied knowledge and
stated that there was no official press release. (C-720, WS Ongarbaev (1
December 2012)). In this context, Respondent’s argument that the INTERFAX
item cannot be attributed to the Republic does not change the impact. Even if
Claimants have not shown that the Republic was in any way involved in the
publication of the INTERFAX item, it is obvious and not disputed by Respondent,
that it was Respondent’s actions starting in October 2008 that caused the
publication.

On 20 December 2008, the Financial Police began conducting repeated
interrogations of TNG and KPM employees. (CPHB 2 {[ 38; R-I {| 26.22; C-46; C-
96; C-620; C-621; C-622; C-623; C-624; C-626; C-627).

On 22 December 2008, TNG refused to submit the required application to the
MEMR and lodged objections to the State’s reversal of its consent to the 2003
transfer. (C-I J 146; CPHB 2 { 117; C-142).

On 24 December 2008, the Financial Police requested information from KPM and
TNG on their gas and condensate outputs. In particular, the letter requested
information regarding (a) the level of production of the company and (b) sales
made by KPM to agents, individuals and other businesses. (R-I {| 26.20; CPHB 2 {I
38; C-94).

On 24 December 2008, the Financial Police issued summonses for Anatolie Stati,
Mr. Cojin, Mr. Salagor, and Mr. Cornegruta. (C-654).

On 25 December 2008, Major Rakhimov of the Financial Police summoned and
interviewed KPM's General Manager, Mr. Cornegruta. (R-I {{ 26.21, 27.38; C-I J]
95). Mr. Cornegruta was considered a witness (R-II {[ 480) and was, accordingly,
not allowed to be accompanied by counsel (C-I {| 95). Respondent denies that Mr.
Cornegruta was not permitted to have legal counsel in attendance for the interview.
He was allowed to under Art. 82.3 CPC. (R-35). After the interview, Mr.
Cornegruta was released and permitted to go about his business. (R-I [ 27.40).

1000.On 26 December 2008, Major Rakhimov summoned and interviewed the then-

Deputy Manager General for Finance of KPM and TNG, Mr. Veaceslav Stejar; (C-
1795, R-IY 26.21).

1001.On 26 December 2008, the Financial Police ordered the seizure of TNG documents
regarding contracts with third parties and construction of pipelines. (C-605, C-
606).

1002.On 29 December 2008, the MEMR requested that TNG provide notarized
documents evidencing the 2003 change in ownership of TNG. (C-144).

1003.On 30 December 2008, the Financial Police conducted an on-site investigation at
the Borankol and Tolkyn Fields. (C-I {| 95). The Respondent alleges that the
purpose of the inspection was to specify the process of production, refining, and
further transportation of hydrocarbon material, and to make sure that the pipelines
matched the documents describing their construction, placement, and other
physical features. (C-95). Mr. Turganbayev attended this inspection and confirms
that it involved visiting KPM’s pipeline. (R-I {{[ 13.47(e), 26.22; R-II If 285, 481;
WS Turganbayev 2 {[ 6.3).

1004. On 30 December 2008, the Tax Committee issued an Act of Inspection, claiming
that TNG could not deduct 100% of drilling expenses in the year they were
incurred for corporate income tax purposes. (Maggs 2 Exhibit 2; CPHB 2 { 128);

1005.On 5 January 2009, Major Rakhimov asked the MEMR to ascertain whether
KPM's 17.9 kilometer pipeline was a main pipeline. (C-718, Rakhimov 3 {J 3.1 —
3.2; Rakhimov, Day 5 pp. 46 — 47).

1006.On 5 January 2009, the research and design institute of KMG NC concluded that
the KPM and TNG pipelines were not main pipelines (C-99, C-100);

1007.On 8 January 2009, the National Scientific and Research Centre on Industrial
Safety of the MES confirmed that the relevant KPM and TNG pipelines were field
pipelines and not main pipelines (C-101; C-104);

1008.On 9 January 2009, NIPI Neftegaz confirmed that KPM's and TNG's pipelines
were not main pipelines (C-101, C-102);

1009.On 14 January 2009, the Financial Police issued a resolution appointing three
investigators to the criminal investigations of KPM and TNG. (C-453).

1010.In January-February 2009, KPM and TNG submitted various complaints regarding
the illegality of the Financial Police’s searches and seizures of documents and
forwarded reports confirming that their pipelines were not main pipelines. (R-I {[
26.25; C-46, C-96, C-620, C-621, C-622, C-623, C-624, C-626, C-627, C-628, C-
629, C-630).

1011.On 22 January 2009, the Financial Police requested corporate documents from
KPM. (C-607).

1012.On 23 January 2009, the Financial Police requested corporate documents from
TNG. (C-608).

1013.On 2 February 2009, the Financial Police informed TNG that, on 20 January 2009,
they had formally opened a criminal investigation against TNG for the alleged

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 220 of 415

operation of main pipelines without a license. The Financial Police notified
Claimants that TNG was the subject of a criminal investigation. The charges were
later suspended. The Financial Police rejected a request to provide the order on the
ground that no person was the subject of the investigation. (C-0 Jf 43, 54; C-I{
96; CPHB 2 {i 38, 61, 142; C-98 (translation disputed by Respondent); C-630;
Condorachi {| 11).

1014. On 4 February 2009, the Financial Police interviewed Mr. Cojin, General Manager
of TNG, to determine whether he or Mr. Cornegruta would be an appropriate
defendant in any criminal proceeding; (R-II {{] 298, 480; Rakhimov 2 {[ 4.5).

1015.On 4 February 2009, MEMR wrote a letter to the Financial Police confirming that
KPM’s pipeline was part of its gathering system, and thus, was not a main pipeline.
The Respondent alleges that this letter was later withdrawn as it was not reviewed
by the legal department and/or because the MEMR has no authority to provide a
classification regarding pipelines. (CPHB 1| {| 171; CPHB 2 {[{[ 38, 61, 98; RPHB 1
{ 229; RPHB 2 {if 183 — 186; C-719; Rakhimov 3 {[{[ 3, Rakhimov Tr. Day 5 pp. 47
—49).

1016.On 9 February 2009, the Financial Police ordered the College of Experts of the
Ministry of Justice ("MOJ") to appoint an expert to classify KPM’s pipeline. (C-I
{ 104; C-II { 249; CPHB 1 {| 181; CPHB 2 {{{[ 38, 61; R-II {{[ 549, RPHB 1 {{ 226;
C-109; R-245; R-362).

1017.On 10 February 2009, Mr. Turganbayev met with the MOJ expert, Mr.
Baymaganbetov, and provided him with four documents on which to base his
report. (R-II { 554; Baymaganbetov. {ff 3.2, 6.2; R-246).

1018.The comprehensive tax audits of KPM and TNG lasted until 10 February 2009. On
that date, the State sent notices of an Act of Inspection to KPM and TNG that the
Article 23 amortization rate, and not the Article 20 rate, was applicable to the
companies’ well drilling costs for the years 2005 to 2007 and assessed
approximately USD 62 million in back taxes and penalties against the companies.
(Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6 to Maggs 2; C-155). The corporate tax dispute embroiled
KPM and TNG in litigation until 22 June 2010, when the Kazakh Court of
Cassation dismissed the claim. (Exhibit 11 to Second Maggs Report; C-155). In
the course of this arbitration, Claimants first learned that Respondent had appealed
the Court of Cassastion’s decision. They were, therefore, unable to participate in
the process that led to the 3 November 2010 decision of the Kazakh Supreme
Court, which overturned the decisions at the lower instances and found that the
corporate income tax assessment was proper. (CPHB | {{ 258; Rahimgaliev
Exhibit 6).

1019.On 11 February 2009, the MEMR withdrew the letter prepared on 4 February
2009, allegedly on the basis that it had not been reviewed by the legal department
of the MEMR. (Rakhimov 3 {[ 3.5). A replacement letter was issued on 11
February 2009. (RPHB 1 {[ 229).

1020.On 13 February 2009, three days after receiving the file and without having
reviewed any other documents or visited KPM’s pipeline, Mr. Baymaganbetov

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 221 of 415

issued his report. (R-II {J 549 — 568; RPHB 2 {| 188; C-110; Baymaganbetov {{{[ 3,
4.1, 4.2, 6).

1021.On 13 February 2009, the MEMR wrote to the Financial Police to provide them
with information on how the definition of trunk pipeline in Article I of the Law on
Oil should be interpreted. The MEMR noted that an expert would need to be
appointed to determine the status of the pipelines in question. (Rakhimov 3 Exhibit
4; RPHB 2 { 183).

1022.On 13 February 2009, the MEMR wrote to KPM and TNG and informed them that
it was not competent to resolve their complaints. The MEMR suggested that they
write to the GPO, instead. (C-629, C-630).

1023.On 24 February 2009, the Financial Police seized KPM’s corporate documents. (C-
609).

1024. On 27 February 2009, the State responded to TNG's objections to the 18 December
2008 notice, stating that the transfer of TNG to Terra Raf had breached the State's
statutory pre-emptive right to acquire TNG. The State demanded that TNG submit
a new application for its consent to the transfer and a waiver of the State's pre-
emptive purchase right Failure to do so would result in termination of TNG’s
Subsoil Use Contracts. (CPHB 2 {| 117; C-146).

1025.On 3 and 4 March 2009, the Financial Police seized KPM’s and TNG’s corporate
documents. (C-610; C-611; C-612).

1026.On 18 March 2009, KPM and TNG complained to the GPO regarding the criminal
investigations. (C-41; C-154; Condorachi {{ 13).

1027.On 19 March 2009, a meeting chaired by the MEMR Executive Secretary, Mr.
A.B. Batalov, and attended by representatives of Terra Raf, TNG, Ascom, and
KPM was held at the MEMR offices. At this meeting, the State's actions against
the Claimants since President Nazarbayev's 14 October 2008 Order were discussed.
The Parties dispute whether Mr. Batalov assured the Claimants that all of these
issues would be disposed of in favour of TNG and KPM, and that TNG's Subsoil
Use Contracts would not be cancelled, if TNG would simply submit a new
application for its transfer to Terra Raf, and would permit the State to re-evaluate
its prior consent. Mr. Batalov also stated that, because the size and value of TNG
had changed since the 2003 transfer to Terra Raf, the State would require a new
and contemporary evaluation of TNG's books and assets (as of February 2007) in
order to properly re-evaluate the transfer. KKMG would conduct this new
evaluation. The Claimants say the MEMR assured them that the pre-emptive right
claim would be resolved in their favour. The Claimants also report that Mr.
Batalov and his deputy indicated that the reclassification of sections of TNG's and
KPM's in-field pipelines as trunk pipelines was, in the MEMR's view, due to a
defect in the applicable legislation. Finally, the Claimants assert that the MEMR
also indicated that the Financial Police ought to rely on the opinions of experts.
Minutes of the meeting were prepared by Mr. Grigore Pisica and were offered to
Mr. Batalov for his signature, but he refused to sign. The Respondent denies that
Mr. Batalov assured the Claimants that all outstanding issues in relation to TNG
and KPM would be resolved in the Claimants’ favour, or that there was any

"reclassification" of pipelines. (C-I {{ 106, 150, 152, 177; R-I {| 13.47(e)(v), 21.1);
C-42; C-111; Lungu 43 — 45; Pisica {ff 32 - 37, 43).

1028.On 24 March 2009, following the meeting with Mr. Batalov of the MEMR, TNG
applied for a permit for the transfer of TNG's ownership to Terra Raf and for a
written decision on the State's waiver of its pre-emptive rights. (C-0 {[ 32, partially
quoted; C-I {ff 153, 332; C-147; Lungu {[ 46; Pisica {[ 38).

1029. On 24 March 2009, TNG applied to the MEMR for the inclusion of the issue of the
extension of the exploration period of Contract 302 for two years into the agenda of
the next meeting of the Expert Commission. (R-I { 31.69; R-162).

1030.On 24 March 2009, KPM and TNG sent a complaint to President Nazarbayev.
(CPHB 2 {{ 142; C-631).

1031.On 25 March 2009, TNG sent the State a request for a written decision regarding
the right of TNG to transfer Terra Raf's ownership interests to a prospective third
party buyer, including KMG, based upon a competitive bidding process and direct
negotiations. No response was ever received. (C-0 {{ 32, partially quoted; C-I {{{]
153, 154, 332; C-148; Pisica J 38; Lungu J 46).

1032.On 27 March 2009, the Financial Police ordered TNG to submit originals of their
corporate documents with reference to the criminal case against KPM. Claimants
also allege that the same request was made of KPM. (C-614; C-615);

1033. On 30 March 2009, Contract 302 expired. (R-II [ 411; C-53).

1034.0n 30 March 2009, KPM responded to the Financial Police’s request for
documents and requested a copy of the criminal investigation order. (C-615).

1035.On 31 March 2009, the Financial Police ordered TNG to submit additional original
company documents. (C-616).

1036.On 2 April 2009, the Expert Commission passed a Decision, which recommended
the extension of Contract 302 for two years. (CPHB | {[ 236; CPHB 2 { 151; R-I'{
31.70; R-163.2).

1037.On 6 April 2009, the Financial Police requested information on TNG’s costs for oil
and condensate in relation to the criminal case against KPM. (CPHB 2 {[ 38; C-
618).

1038.On 9 April 2009, the MEMR issued a written statement to execute the extension of
Contract 302 to 30 March 2011, which the Claimants allege that they requested on
9 March 2009, and which the Respondent states was requested on 24 March 2009.
The Claimants allege that the MEMR notified TNG of its agreement to extend
Contract 302 and undertook to execute the amendment by 2 July 2009.
Respondent states that the adopted decision has the character of a recommendation
and is only one of many legal actions required for a valid contract extension. (C-0 {

Respondent was under no obligation to extend prior to the 9 April 2009 letter, at
least. (Compare RPHB 2 fn 526 with C-II {| 242; see also CPHB 1 {[ 224 (Parties
experts’ debate on obligation to extend contract after 9 April)).

On 20 April 2009, Major Rakhimov decided to detain KMG's general manager,
Mr. Cornegruta, and opened criminal proceedings against him for the crime of
illegal entrepreneurial activity under Article 190(2)(b) of the Criminal Code of
Kazakhstan. At that time, Mr. Cornegruta was named as a potential defendant. (R-
II { 487; RPHB 2 {[ 189; R-243, Rakhimov 2 [7.1 - 7.5). On 22 April 2009, the
Financial Police ordered additional company documents from KPM. (CPHB 2 {[
38; C-617).

On 25 April 2009, the Financial Police arrested Mr. Cornegruta. (C-I {| 44, partially
quoted; R-I {| 27.2; C-117; Exhibit 1 and 3 to Rakhimov 2). Respondent admits
that Mr. Cornegruta was denied bail, pursuant to Kazakh law. (R-I {| 27.45, R-35).

On 26 April 2009, the Claimants filed complaints against the Financial Police,
including its head investigator, Major Rakhimov. The same day, 900 employees of
KMG, TNG, and CASCo that were on shift addressed and signed a letter to the
Governor of the Mangystau Region expressing their concerns, particularly in
relation to Mr. Cornegruta's welfare. (C-I {| 109; C-113; Condorachi { 16, 19;
Pisica { 41; Romanosov { 31; Stati { 26).

On 27 April 2009, Mr. Batalov was fired as Executive Secretary of the MEMR. (C-
I 106, 332; Pisica {{ 43).

On 27 April 2009, a petition against Mr. Cornegruta's arrest was considered and
rejected by the Court of Aktau. (RPHB | {[ 244; Kravchenko {| 13.14; Exhibit 6
Kravchenko).

On 30 April 2009, the Financial Police issued attachment orders in respect of
KPM's and TNG's Subsoil Use Contracts. The Claimants allege that the Financial
Police issued no fewer than 10 orders for the sequestration of property, which
resulted in freezing KPM's and TNG's shares, KPM's Contract 305, TNG's
Contracts 210 and 302, KPM's field oil pipeline, TNG's field gas pipeline, TNG's
condensate pipeline and the companies' other property. (C-I { 121; R-I { 29.2; C-
486; C-487; C-488; C-489; C-490; C-491; C-492; C-493; C-494; C-495; C-496; C-
497; C-498; C-499; C-500; Condorachi {[ 38). Those orders prevented KPM and
TNG from selling or depreciating the value of those assets. (C-I { 121; CPHB 1 {|
140).

The Claimants say that, on 30 April 2009 and on 4 May 2009, TNG submitted
Addendum No. 9 of TNG's Tabyl Block Subsoil Use Contract to the MEMR for
execution. TNG never received the MEMR's signature to the addendum extending
TNG's exploration rights. (C-168).

On 30 April 2009, the Deputy Minister of the MES wrote to the Claimants and
asked them to withdraw his previous letters of 19 November 2008 (confirming that
KPM's and TNG's pipelines were not main pipelines), as their issuance was beyond
his competence. (R-189).

On | May 2009, the decision to detain Mr. Cornegruta was confirmed on appeal.
(R-II {| 487; RPHB 1 {{ 244; Kravchenko 2 {{ 13.15).

On 4 May 2009, Major Rakhimov of the Financial Police ordered an unscheduled
inspection to determine the amount of income KPM had obtained from operating a
trunk pipeline without a license. (RPHB 2 {[ 190; C-184).

Pursuant to a search warrant dated 30 April 2009, on 6 and 7 May 2009, the
Financial Police conducted an overnight search of KPM's and TNG's offices for the
other General Managers of KPM, Messrs. Salgor and Spasov, and the General
Manager of TNG, Mr. Cojin, as well as information on their whereabouts. The
three in-country managers had by then been charged with the same offence as Mr.
Cornegruta. The initial phase of the search started at 4:20 p.m. on 6 May 2009 and
ended at 4:15 a.m. on 7 May 2009. The search was carried out in the presence of
Deputy General for Economic and Financial Affairs of TNG, Mr. Stejar. The
Respondent states that the Financial Police procured human resources and financial
records from KPM and TNG and that it became clear during the course of the
investigation that most senior managers had left Kazakhstan. The Parties dispute
the level of inconvenience caused by the search. (R-I {| 27.47; R-II {{ 301, 483, R-
TIT {{ 504 — 507, 511; RPHB 1 { 170, 175 — 176, 233 — 238; C-114; Rakhimov 2 {{{f

On 7 May 2009, Anatolie Stati, allegedly on behalf of the Claimants, wrote to
President Nazarbayev to obtain the release of Mr. Cornegruta, to protect the former
and current management of KPM and TNG, and to end the dispute. Around this
date, Mr. Stati decided to pause construction on the LPG Plant and to reduce
planned development efforts at Tolkyn and Borankol. The Claimants also allege
that this letter made clear that the Claimants intended to bring arbitration claims
against Kazakhstan for the diminution in the value of their investments once the
sale to Cliffson closed. Respondent admits that the letter was sent by Ascom and
denies Claimants’ allegations regarding notice. (R-II {{ 226. The Respondent also
notes that the Cliffson transaction, at earliest, could have started in February 2010.
(C-43; Stati {| 28)

On 13 May 2009, the Mangystau Regional Department of the MES withdrew its
letters about whether the pipelines were trunk pipelines. (R-I {[ 28.14; RPHB 2
198; C-90; C-93).

On 15 May 2009, the Financial Police notified KPM and TNG that they had seized
the Claimants' equity interests in KPM and TNG two days before on 13 May 2009.
The asset and equity seizures were designed to prevent KPM and TNG from selling
or transferring their interests during the course of the criminal proceeding against
Mr. Cornegruta. (C-I { 121). In addition, the Financial Police requested additional
documents from KPM. (C-668 and C-485). Respondent states that the Financial
Police issued attachment orders. (R-I {[ 29.2). Respondent does not admit that the
Financial Police notified KPM and TNG that it had seized KPM’s and TNG’s
equity interests on 13 May 2009. If the allegation is that Claimants were prevented
from transferring their interests during proceedings, then that would be appropriate
under the circumstances. (R-I {[ 26.26(c)).

1053.On 18 May 2009, the College of Experts of the Ministry of Justice calculated
KPM's purported illegal profits from oil and gas transportation services at 5.9
million Tenge (approximately USD 48,300) for the period from 2002 through
2008. This calculation also showed "illegal profits" of approximately 1,935,547
Tenge (approximately USD 15,000) from March 2007 to May 2008. (C-I { 92, C-
184). The Respondent denies this and states that that expert considered that the
value of income from illegally operating the trunk pipeline amounted to
65,479,414,197 Tenge for the period from April 2002 to 2008, and that its income
during the relevant period in 2007 and 2008 was 21,673,919,031 Tenge. (R-I
27.59(c), (h); C-117, C-184). The Respondent states that this calculation was
necessary to determine whether the crime of illegal entrepreneurship had been
triggered. (R-II { 484; C-184). The Respondent admits that the Court relied on this
document when determining the amount of the fine to be imposed on KPM. In all
other respects, the Claimants’ assertions concerning this report are denied. (R-I {[
27.60).

1054.On 18 May 2009, Major Rakhimov issued an application to exclude Claimants’
expert opinions about the classification of the pipelines. (R-II {{{[ 632; RPHB 2 {|
206; Kravchenko 2 {ff 11.13, 11.14, 11.22; Kravchenko 2 Exhibit 2). The expert
reports included a report dated 5 January 2009 from the Kazakh Scientific,
Research and Design Institute of Oil and Gas (a division of KMG) that found the
pipelines owned by KPM and TNG "do not belong to the category of main
pipelines and are designated to ensure the process of hydrocarbons production."
(C-I { 98, emphasis maintained; C-99; C-100).The expert reports also included a
report that the Scientific, Research, and Design Institute of Oil and Gas Industry of
NIPI Neftegaz concluded on 9 January 2009 that the pipelines owned by KPM and
TNG were correctly "classified as in-field pipelines." The Court later deemed the
Claimants' expert opinions to be inadmissible on the grounds that these so-called
expert opinions did not evidence KPM and TNG's requests for such opinions,
making it impossible for the court to divine the scope of the request. There was no
indication that the bodies were independent of the Claimants, and some of the
experts whose reports were excluded had a role in the construction of the pipelines
and in the legal amendments regarding their status. In any event, they were not
qualified to issue such opinions and had not been appointed pursuant to Article 243
of the CPC. (RPHB 2 {| 203 — 207; Kravchenko 2 Exhibit 2).

1055.On 19 May 2009, the Financial Police requested the valuation of sequestered
property from KPM. (C-500).

1056.On 15 June 2009, Kazakhstan indicted Mr. Cornegruta. (C-454).

1057.On 17 June 2009, the Financial Police issued a press release that announced that
the investigative phase had concluded. The media reported on the ongoing
criminal investigations and reported that KPM and TNG had obtained illegal
profits of 147 billion Tenge and that the companies’ assets had been sequestered.
(C-0 7 45, C-II { 602; CPHB 2 {[ 38; R-I {[ 26.24; C-118).

1058.On 27 June 2009, the Regional Prosecutor’s Office corresponded with Ascom and
Terra Raf noting the international search underway for Mr. Cojin. (C-183).

1059.On 2 July 2009, the MEMR failed to execute the extension of the exploration
period of Contract 302. (C-27; R-163.1);

1060. Mr. Cornegruta’s trial was held between 30 July and 14 September 2009. (C-704;
R-315.1 (in Russian); R-315.2 (in Russian); R-316; R-317; R-318; R-319).

1061.On 18 September 2009, Aktau City Court found Mr. Cornegruta guilty of “illegal

entrepreneurial activity in an especially large amount” for operating a main
pipeline without a license and ordered recovery of USD 145 million from KPM.
(C-117) Respondent admits that KPM was not a party to the criminal proceeding

against Mr. Cornegruta and explains that the Court was asked to rule on whether

Mr. Cornegruta, on behalf of KPM, was guilty of the crime. Respondent denies
that KPM was not represented in either the hearing or the appeal. (R-I { 27.60; R-
TI if 615, 645; RPHB 2 ff 246 — 261; C-117).

1062.On 21 September 2009, President Nazarbayev’s Head of Administration issued an
order regarding “free of charge transfer of [Claimants’] assets.” (RPHB 1 401;
C-294; Mynbaev Day 3 pp. 159 — 167).

1063. On 30 September 2009, the Financial Police ordered a new audit of KPM regarding
alleged failure to pay export taxes. (Condorachi WS {[ 34).

1064.On 22 October 2009, the Financial Police questioned Mr. Condorachi regarding
KPM’s alleged obligation to pay export taxes. (C-0 {| 75; C-I [ 168; CPHB 2 {If 38,

1065.On 3 November 2009, the Financial Police interviewed Mr. Cornegruta in jail

regarding KPM’s alleged obligation to pay export taxes. (Condorachi WS 4] 36).

1066.On 12 November 2009, the Appeal Court upheld the criminal judgment of Aktau

City Court finding Mr. Cornegruta guilty of illegal entrepreneurial activity in an
especially large amount and ordering recovery of USD 145 million from KPM. (C-

1067.On 19 November 2009, President Nazarbayev issued an instruction to the Prime
Minister, Minister Mynbayev, and Timur Kulibayev to look into and resolve the

issue with respect to KPM and TNG. (R-II { 332; C-23).

1068.On 29 December 2009, a Writ of Enforcement was issued against KPM for USD

145 million. (C-119).

1069.On 29 December 2009, the Tax Committee concluded an audit of transfer pricing

and claimed that KPM and TNG owed approximately 700 million Tenge (US $5
million) in unpaid transfer prices and penalties. (R-I {[ 30.63; C-137 and C-138).

1070.KPM and TNG commenced legal action challenging the transfer pricing claim (R-

II § 649). This was still pending as of the State’s 21-22 July 2010 take-over.
(CPHB 2 {[ 128).

1071.On 10 January 2010, Kazakhstan froze the bank accounts of KPM to satisfy the
USD 145 million judgment against it. (C-I { 125; CPHB | { 212; CPHB 2 {[ 38; R-I
4 29.7; C-119; C-121).

1072. From 25 January to 6 February 2010, MEMR carried out unscheduled inspections
of KPM and TNG regarding historical compliance with Subsoil Use Contracts and
Kazakh law. (C-0 J 55; C-II { 290; CPHB 2 {ff 38, 61; C-171, C-385, C-386, and
C-599). Respondent states that the purpose was to ensure compliance with
contractual obligations and legislation, not to assess legality from 1997 to present.
(R-I {| 31.96; C-171; C-174). While Respondent states that the purpose was to
ensure compliance with contractual obligations and legislation and not to assess
legality from 1997 to present, this stands in contradiction to C-174, which
Respondent has also cited.

1073.From January to June 2010, Kazakh enforcement officers took repeated measures
to recover funds from KPM to satisfy the court's criminal judgment. (C-7! -122;
C-123; C-124; C-125; C-199; C-201; C-298; C-501; C-502; C-503; C-504; C-505;
C-506; C-507).

 

1074.On 26 January 2010, the Ministry of Finance began bankruptcy proceedings
against KPM. (CPHB 2 {If 38, 128; C-157).

1075.On 17 February 2010, the President of Kazakh social fund “Blagovest” wrote to
Minister Mynbaev to make a suggestion to “resolve the question of nationalization
of the assets posed in 2008”. (CPHB 2 § 38; RPHB 1 4 404 (saying 7 February); C-
23).

1076. On 24 February 2010, the Customs Committee informed both KPM and TNG that
they were liable for unpaid export taxes. (C-44; C-479). One month later, on 31
March 2010, the Customs Committee retracted this claim and conceded that the
Subsoil Use Contracts exempted KPM and TNG from export taxes. (C-I { 170;
CPHB 2 {ff 38, 128; R-I {| 30.56; C-130).

1077.By mid-March 2010, Kazakhstan’s court administrators had seized nearly every
asset of KPM, including key oil production equipment, and had prevented KPM
from importing equipment and exporting oil. Nevertheless, the Claimants
continued to pay the salaries of KPM’s workers through TNG’s accounts. While
Respondent disputes that salaries were paid, Respondent, despite having access to
information that would suggest otherwise, has not provided any. (CPHB 2 {{ 194;
RPHB 2 {[ 349).

1078.On 30 April 2010, MOG informed KPM and TNG that a sale to Cliffson was not
possible because the companies’ shares were sequestered / arrested. (C-528; C-
529). It would only be approved if KPM and TNG satisfied the requirements to
release the attachment of their shares. (R-II { 818).

1079.From 25 to 29 June 2010, on the order of the Prime Minister and with the
involvement of the Financial Police, the GPO ordered unscheduled inspections of
KPM and TNG from no fewer than seven different Kazakh agencies. (CPHB 2 {
38; C-174; C-175; C-177;, C-178; C-180; C-181; C-182; C-185; C-315; C-647; C-

Page 227 of 414

On 9 July 2010, while inspections were underway, TNG was notified that the
Prime Minister had planned to visit the field facilities and the LPG Plant. TNG was
instructed to make preparations for his 20 — 21/23 July visit. (C-186; C-299).

On 14 July 2010, the MOG sent notices to KPM and TNG that the companies were
in violation of Subsoil Use Contracts 210 and 305. (R-I {] 31.19; C-II { 346, CPHB
1 { 296, CPHB 2 {{{[ 74, 178; RPHB 1 {{ 360; RPHB 2 {{ 354). The notices from the
MOG were dated 14 July 2010, but were not received by KPM and TNG until 16
July 2010. (R-I { 31.54). The notices set out (1) the contract to which the notice
related, (2) the contractual breaches by KPM and TNG, (3) a deadline within which
to respond, and (4) the consequences for failing to respond to the notice. (R-I {]
31.107). The notices gave KPM and TNG until 19 July 2010 to “submit
explanations on reasons of non-execution of contract terms and all necessary
documents, ascertaining removal of the above-mentioned violations, as well as to
inform [the MOG] on measures taken in order to avoid violation of contract terms.”
Respondent reports that the violations in the notices included “admissions” by
KPM and TNG that they had operated trunk oil and gas pipelines without a license
and 13 additional alleged violations for which Claimants state that the State had
provided no prior notice to KPM or TNG. (R-I {ff 31.103 et seq.). Claimants report
that the notices listed 16 alleged violations. The notice further provided that “[i]n
case of failure to comply with the request set forth in this Notice within the
established time limit, the Competent Body is entitled to terminate the
Contract[s].” (C-0 {| 88; C-I {| 20, 206 — 208, 332). Respondent states that the
violations contained in the notice of 14 July 2010 were detected by the competent
authority as a result of permanent monitoring of the compliance by the subsurface
users of their contractual obligations. (R-I {{ 31.42). The audits proved that
production activities at KPM and TNG had virtually stopped; there was little
chance of employee salaries being paid. (R-II { 692). The Parties state that, by this
time, the majority of TNG and KPM senior and middle management had left
Kazakhstan. (R-II { 698; C-1 { 218).

On 19 July 2010, Claimants submitted written answers and explanations
concerning each violation alleged in the 14 July 2010 notice. (C-0 { 89, CPHB 2 {|
178; RPHB | { 361, RPHB 2 {[ 354). Claimants had, previously, on 22 January
and on 28 June 2010, provided evidence of their compliance with the work
program requirements. (C-I { 209). In July 2010, they provided all that they had.
KPM explained that it failed to pay costs costs amounting to US 114,809, because
KPM this figure was a direct result of the Financial Police seizing KPM’s assets in
May 2009 and the judicial executor seizing bank accounts in January 2010. These
seizures were a result of the state-initiated criminal investigation, which in and of
themselves constituted a force majeure under the contract. KPM explained that it
was unable to pay the USD 10,000 owed to the liquidation fund and various taxes
because of the financial constraints caused by the criminal investigations. KPM
also stressed that its pipeline was never a trunk or main pipeline. KPM responded
to the allegation regarding its obligation to purchase goods, works, and services, by
simply referring the Ministry to its previously submitted “notes and objections”
explaining how this issue too, like all of the other claims, was groundless. TNG
replied similarly, and submitted documentation showing that none of the Ministry’s
claims were proper. With respect to Contract 302, TNG documented its work and
training programs, the purchase of goods, works, and services, and demonstrated
that the re-classified pipeline was not trunk. (C-I {{[ 211 — 216). Respondent states

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 229 of 415
Page 228 of 414

that Claimants’ responses were inadequate and failed to address the violations. (R-
154). For example, in response to the notice of KPM’s and TNG’s failure to
instruct and train a Kazakh specialist, KPM and TNG referred to funding allocated
for the training of all employees. In response to the notice of KPM’s failure to pay
costs according to the Additional Agreement of 13 June 2008, KPM simply denied
liability based on “force majeure.” KPM and TNG also argued force majeure to
excuse their failure to contribute to the liquidation funds, as required by Contracts
305 and 210, and KPM used that argument to excuse its non-payment of taxes.
Both tried to re-open the discussion on whether the pipelines were trunk.
Importantly, Claimants refused to “remove the violations of their obligations THI”
(R-I{ 31.121; RPHB 2 {| 354). R-I'f 31.122; R-154).

1083.Respondent, in any event, disputes that these responses were received on time and
argues that they were received by the MOG after 21 July 2010. (R-I {{ 31.54;
RPHB 1 { 362).

1084. Between 21 and 22 July 2010, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Oil and Gas
publicly declared the takeover and abrogation of the Claimants’ Subsoil Use
Contracts, seized the assets of KPM and TNG, and caused them, in due course, to
be transferred to KMG, which later appointed its subsidiary KazMunaiTeniz as
“trust manager” for the companies. (R-I {| 31.129, 31.150 et seq.; R-II { 701; C-3,
C-4, C-5, C-189, C-190; C-194; C-195; R-152; R-153, R-200; R-257).

1085. Having considered all of the Parties submissions, even where not expressly stated
herein, the Tribunal draws the following conclusions:

1086. The Tribunal considers that it need not find that there was a “playbook”, as alleged
by Claimants and as recorded above in this Award, to find that the conduct
presented in the above timeline constitutes a violation of the FET. Indeed, for the
Tribunal, the evaluation of the objective timetable is sufficient. | While
Respondent’s explanations and justifications regarding some specific actions it has
taken affecting Claimants’ investments may perhaps at least be arguable, even if
not convincing to the Tribunal, (1) the picture of them seen cumulatively in context
to each other and (2) the difference of treatment of Claimants’ investments before
and after the Order of the President of the Republic on 14/16 October 2008, permit
only the conclusion that Respondent’s conduct after the President’s Order was a
string of measures of coordinated harassment by various institutions of Respondent
and has to be considered as a breach of the obligation to treat investors fairly and
equitably, as required by Art. 10(1) ECT.

1087.The Parties are in agreement, and the Tribunal agrees as well, that prior to
November 2008, Respondent’s authorities regularly inspected KPM’s and TNG’s
pipelines. The Parties are in agreement, and the Tribunal agrees as well, that there
was no change in the pipeline from the date that Kazakh authorities approved the
design and construction of the pipelines until the 18 November 2008 inspection
where the Financial Police — who Respondent agrees are not the competent
authority to classify a pipeline — declared that the pipelines at issue were a “trunk”
rather than field pipelines. (R-II { 451). The Tribunal, however, is not persuaded
by Respondent’s argument that the Financial Police, in pursuit of their lawful
obligations, simply made this discovery during an inspection — a discovery that was
not made during any of the prior routine inspections that were made by agencies

who were competent to classify pipelines. Rather, it is far more likely that this
alleged “discovery”, as well as the events leading to it and those stemming from it,
constitute violations of the FET and, in particular Claimants’ legitimate
expectations toward proper and fair governmental conduct.

The Tribunal need not opine on whether the pipeline was a field or trunk pipeline
in order to find that the procedure surrounding the discovery was in violation of the
FET standard. The Parties have presented that Claimants operated a pipeline
system that was approved by Kazakh authorities. During routine inspections from
2002 — until November 2008, there was no indication that anyone believed that the
pipelines were trunk pipelines and Respondent has provided no indication that the
proper authorities were in any way prevented from having made the same
discovery sooner. Instead, the evidence demonstrates that, it was not until
immediately prior to the “discovery”, namely on 12 November 2008, that the
Financial Police began to seek information on whether KPM and TNG held
licenses to operate trunk pipelines. On Friday, 14 November 2008, the Financial
Police received confirmation that neither company held such licenses.
Immediately thereafter, on the following Monday, 17 November 2008, the
Financial Police “discovered” that KPM and TNG operated a trunk pipeline and
ordered the Tax Committee to calculate profit earned from operating that pipeline.

Following the “discovery”, Claimants received confirmation from numerous
Kazakh authorities that the pipeline at issue was a field, rather than a trunk
pipeline. Often, however, the Financial Police compelled these authorities, in
particular the MES and the MEMR, to withdraw their statements. The evidence
also indicates that even the Judicial Executor admitted that the segment at issue
was a mere “field” — and not “trunk” pipeline.

Accordingly, the Tribunal is persuaded by Claimants’ argument which
demonstrates that this was not a mere “discovery” but that, rather, this was a re-
classification. As indicated, there were no changes to the pipelines prior to their
change in designation. The segments of Claimants’ pipes that are at issue extend
from the principal joint where the KPM wellhead pipes converge to KPM’s
processing facility, and from the processing facility to TNG’s storage tanks, where
services are also provided to KPM. For the TNG gathering system, the segment
extends from the principal joint where the TNG wellhead pipes converge to TNG’s
processing facility; from the processing facility directly to the CAC Pipeline for
gas; and from the processing facility to TNG’s storage tanks for condensate.
Claimants state that identical gathering systems are owned and operated by other
oil and gas companies in the immediate vicinity — and indeed throughout
Kazakhstan — none of which are classified as trunk pipelines requiring licensure.
(C-0 4] 39 — 40, partially quoted). The Tribunal is persuaded that the at-issue
pipelines, likewise, were not trunk pipelines requiring licensure but were rather
arbitrarily re-classified by Respondent. That the City Court of Aktau found that the
pipes were trunk does not bind this Tribunal.

The re-classification, viewed in light of President Nazarbayev’s 23 November 2009
confidential instruction that was attached to the 7 February 2010 Blagovest letter
(C-23), appears to have been an important step for the State to have obtained the
assets of KPM and TNG, without sacrificing their working ability.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 231 of 415
Page 230 of 414

1092. While the Parties dispute many aspects of the June — July 2010 inspections, the
Tribunal is satisfied that these sudden inspections, which involved no fewer than
seven Kazakh agencies, unduly harassed Claimants. It appears from the evidence
presented that these numerous agencies, each reacting to the same orders of the
Prime Minister, the GPO, and the Financial Police, conducted inspections which, in
some aspects, may have been duplicative of one another. In particular, the
Tribunal notes that multiple agencies were tasked with reviewing KPM’s and
TNG’s compliance with their Subsoil Use Contracts. These sudden inspections
forced KPM and TNG to spend their time and resources addressing the inspections,
rather than operating normally. Importantly, throughout this barrage of
inspections, no remedies were available to Claimants. Despite filing complaints
with relevant authorities, no help was forthcoming. Respondent’s conduct and
treatment of Claimants, therefore, violated the FET standard.

1093. The Tribunal is, finally, not convinced that Claimants violated Kazakh law. Even
without determining whether the pipeline was trunk, the evidence indicates that the
charge of “illegal entrepreneurial activity in an especially large amount” under
Art. 190(2)(b) of the Kazakh Criminal Code did not comply with Kazakh law.
Instead, the threshold calculation for “illegal profits” was only met by including
both the transport fee KPM earned from TNG for use of the pipeline, as well as
KPM’s entire revenues from the onward sales of oil. Kazakhstan assessed “illegal
profits” from operating the trunk pipeline — and this fine amounted to more than 65
billion Tenge for KPM and more than 82 billion Tenge for TNG — reflecting all of
the revenue that both companies had generated for oil, gas, and condensate
production from 2002 — 2008. These calculations were unfair, did not consider
expenses or costs, and did not correspond to the transportation fees that would have
applied if the pipeline segment was truly a trunk pipeline. Importantly, the fine
was contrary to Kazakh law, which requires the deduction of lawfully obtained
revenue from otherwise illegal activity. The Tribunal is persuaded by Claimants’
argument that the proper calculation could have yielded USD 12,000 — 13,000 in
illegal profits — an amount below the USD 17,000 threshold for the crime.

1094. Respondent disputes whether Kemikal’s actions are attributable to the state and
argue that, per the PwC Due Diligence Report, Kemikal stopped making payments
due to “liquidity and insolvency” issues. (R-II {| 757 — 758; RPHB 2 {J 21 — 23,
61, 124). Claimants argue that the evident relationships between President
Nazarbayev and his son-in-law are reason enough to believe that the Kazakh State
were the cause of the various difficulties they encountered in endeavouring to
secure their gas sales and export rights commencing in the fall of 2008 and
continuing into 2009. They point to the close relationships said to exist between
KMG, under the chairmanship of Mr. Kulibayev, and the KazAzot resistance to
signing the Tripartite Agreement after over two years of negotiations and the
signature of the other two parties to the agreement. They also point to their
difficulties with Kemikal, and its failure, at the critical time in the fall of 2008, to
continue supplying bank guarantees to secure payment of its accounts. The
Tribunal finds that it is more probable than not that there was State influence at
play with respect to the failure by KazAzot to sign the Tri-Partite Agreement.
Similarly, the Tribunal finds that the relationship between Kemikal and Timur
Kulibayev is established on the basis of Professor Olcott's evidence that Kemikal
was managed by Samruk-Kazyna, which is the Kazakh state welfare fund and is
100% owned and controlled by Kazakhstan. Mr. Kulibayev was, as the Claimants

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 232 of 415
Page 231 of 414

have submitted, close to Samruk-Kazyna, having served at one time as deputy
manager of its holding company shortly after its launch in 2006 until 2007, later
returning in 2008 as deputy CEO when Samruk's responsibilities increased.
Considering these facts in the context of the familial ties between President
Nazarbayev and Mr. Kulibayev, the Tribunal concludes that it is more probable
than not that Kemikal's failure to provide the requisite bank guarantees to TNG in
late 2008 was caused by Kazakhstan. While this evaluation of the evidence
regarding non-implementation of the Agreement is by no means the sole reason for
the Tribunal’s conclusion, it does contribute to and confirm that it was part of and
due to the Respondent’s conduct found to be in breach of the ECT.

1095.Taking into account the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that
Respondent’s measures, seen cumulatively in context to each other and compared
with the treatment of Claimants’ investments before the Order of the President of
the Republic on 14/16 October 2008, constituted a string of measures of
coordinated harassment by various institutions of Respondent. These measures
must be considered as a breach of the obligation to treat investors fairly and
equitably, as required by Art. 10(1) ECT.

J.T. Whether Claimants’ Interests were Expropriated
(Art 13 ECT)

1. Arguments by Claimants
a. Law on Expropriation

1096. Article 13 ECT prohibits direct and indirect expropriation, to the extent that
expropriatory measures are not carried out in accordance with the requirements of
Art. 13 ECT. (C-I 9 243 — 244). Under international law, as described in
Compaiiia del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A. v. Costa Rica, “an expropriation
occurs where the state takes measures which deprive the owner of title, possession
or access to the benefit and economic use of his property. ‘A deprivation or taking
of property may occur under international law through interference by a state in
the use of that property or with the enjoyment of its benefits, even where legal title
to the property is not affected.” (C-I{ 246). Under Art. 13(3) ECT, expropriation
may be of assets of a company that an investor owns, even as a shareholder. (C-I
{il 246 — 247). Article 13 ECT expressly prohibits any measure of expropriation
(direct or indirect) by Kazakhstan that does not cumulatively satisfy four distinct
requirements: the expropriation must be “(a) for a purpose which is in the public
interest; (b) not discriminatory; (c) carried out under due process of law; and (d)
accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.”
Respondent’s actions have met none of these requirements. (C-I {{{[ 286 — 288,
partially quoted).

1097. The minimum requirement for an expropriation to be lawful under Art. 13 ECT is
that it be carried out in the public interest / for a bona fide public purpose. As the
Tribunal in ADC v. Hungary found, a mere reference to “public interest” will not
satisfy this requirement. Nevertheless, Respondent has never alleged that the taking
was for the public interest, not that it in any event could satisfy that requirement.
Instead, Respondent’s many actions served an entirely different purpose, namely

1098.

1099.

1100.

1101.

Page 232 of 414

the diminution of value in Claimants’ investments, until the state seized them
outright. Accordingly, since none of the actions of either indirect or direct
expropriation were for a purpose that was in the public interest, the Tribunal should
conclude that Kazakhstan’s expropriation of Claimants’ investments was unlawful
under Art. 13 ECT and international law. (C-I | 289 — 296).

“Due process” encompasses procedural and substantive fairness, and this has been
recognized by international tribunals. Claimants explain:

300. The failures of due process at issue in this case are markedly more
numerous and severe than those at issue in ADC and Kardassopoulos. The
Tribunal in both of those cases found that the host States had not given the
investors a reasonable opportunity to be heard following an expropriation.
In the present case, Claimants were given no chance at all to be heard or
to object to the direct expropriation that occurred in July 2010.
Furthermore, despite their many efforts to contest Kazakhstan’s various
measures of indirect expropriation during the October 2008 — July 2010
period, all of Claimants’ objections, explanations, and appeals for
assistance fell on deaf ears. Claimants vigorously contested the various
audits, inspections, findings, criminal charges, fines, and seizures levied
during that period, but all of their complaints fell upon deaf ears. (C-I
300).

  

Respondent’s actions of indirect and direct expropriation were not carried out
under due process of law, as required by Art. 13 ECT. The most blatant due
process violations occurred in relation to the prosecution, trial, and conviction of
Mr. Cornegruta and the conviction of non-party KPM. Claimants allege that the
criminal charges and the substantive evidence were entirely fabricated and the
court was obviously partial. Not only that, but KPM — a non-party to the criminal
proceedings, an entity that could not even be prosecuted under Kazakh law — was
convicted and ordered to pay a fine of more than USD 145 million. Among other
things, this sum bore no relation to the charges and constituted all of KPM’s oil and
gas revenues for March 2007 — May 2008. The court made no effort to deliver the
verdict to KPM or to provide KPM notice of its content. It was only after
enforcement that KPM finally received a copy. Appeals were unsuccessful —
KPM’s appeal, filed after it finally received a copy of the verdict on 25 January
2010 — nine days after receiving a copy, was refused as untimely. (C-I {{{ 297, 301
— 306; CPHB 1 {i{[ 188 — 213; CPHB 2 {| 97 — 114).

The incessant criminal investigations against KPM and TNG starting in 2008 were
baseless, unfair, politically motivated, and pursued without regard to due process.
KPM and TNG’s complaints to the relevant authorities regarding these were either
ignored or served only to prompt more investigations. (C-I {| 307 — 309).

Respondent also committed due process violations with regard to Claimants’ rights
to extend the exploration period for the Contract 302 properties and to confirm
ownership of TNG to Terra Raf. Requests for action and assistance were ignored.
Finally, Claimants were promised an extension, and then the Republic failed to
issue it. (C-I {J 310-311) At the hearing, Respondent’s witness Mr. Ongarbaev,
formerly of MEMR, confirmed that the MEMR had decided to allow the extension.
Documents that Claimants withheld, including the PwC Due Diligence Report, also
confirmed the extension. (CPHB 1 {{{[ 221 — 230, 237).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 234 of 415

Page 233 of 414

1102.The total take over to KPM and TNG in July 2010 was accomplished without
reference to due process. KPM and TNG were given only 3 days to respond to and
explain the multiple allegations of violation of the Subsoil Use Contracts before the
contracts were repudiated. This lack of reasonable time alone is sufficient for a
finding of violation of due process. In any event, the responses were wholly
ignored and Kazakhstan unilaterally repudiated the contracts and physically took
over KPM and TNG. (C-I {311 — 313).

1103.Claimants also allege that Respondent’s expropriatory measures were
discriminatory, and incorporate by reference its arguments regarding the ECT’s
FET standard and the ECT’s impairment clause. (C-I { 317, C-I {{f[ 337 et seq., {1
352 et seq.).

1104. Respondent has also failed in its obligation to pay prompt, adequate, and effective
compensation, as required by Art. 13 ECT and as firmly grounded in international
law. To date, no compensation has been paid. (C-I {{[ 314 — 316).

b. Exhaustion of Remedies

1105.Respondent’s arguments that Claimants are precluded from bringing a claim of
illegal expropriation under the ECT because they have failed to exhaust dispute
resolution mechanisms or to exhaust domestic remedies available to them is simply
wrong. Claimants’ first argument in this respect is taken from their own words:

452. There is a de 1 distinction between Kazakh ’s obligati to
Claimants as qualified “Investors” under the Treaty, including the duty
not to expropriate Claimants’ investments unlawfully, and Kazakhstan's
obligations to KPM and TNG under the contracts, including the duty not to
terminate those contracts in violation of the contracts’ termination
provisions or applicable law. The respective parties and causes of action
are different in the two situations. In short, “[a] treaty cause of action is
not the same as a contractual cause of action.” There would have been
nothing preventing KPM and TNG, at least in a theoretical sense, from
raising breach-of-contract claims against Kazakhstan while the Claimants
commenced separate Treaty claims against Kazakhstan. In fact, KPM and
TNG have not lost the right to pursue their contract claims against
Kazakhstan, and whether they did so at the time or do so in the future has
no bearing on either Claimants’ right to bring an expropriation claim
under the Treaty or whether Kazakhstan's unlawful termination of the
Subsoil Use Contracts and takeover of KPM and TNG amounted to a
direct expropriation of Claimants’ investments. Kazakhstan is mistakenly
conflating two different types of legal claims, only one of which
(Claimants’ claims for Kazakhstan’s breaches of the ECT) is before this
Tribunal. (C-II J 452).

1106.The ECT does not contain a requirement for exhaustion remedies, and investment
case law affirms that no such requirement exists. The tribunal in Helnan v. Egypt
(which Respondent cites elsewhere) rejected any requirement to pursue available
remedies as an element of showing a treaty breach, since doing so “would empty
the development of investment arbitration of much of its force and effect, if, despite
a clear intention of States parties not to require the pursuit of local remedies as a

pre-condition to arbitration, such a requirement were to be read back in as part of
the substantive cause of action.” (C-IL 453, partially quoted).

The ECT contains a “fork-in-the-road” clause, under which Kazakhstan only
consents to submit disputes under the ECT to international arbitration where an
investor has not already submitted the dispute for resolution before local courts or
tribunals or in accordance with other previously agreed upon dispute resolution
procedures. Thus, if Claimants (as opposed to KPM or TNG) had chosen to
challenge the expropriation before Kazakhstan’s courts, they might have been
precluded from bringing the present action. This makes it clear that no requirement
of exhausting domestic remedies can exist in this case. (C-II {{] 454 — 455).

Moreover, the Subsoil Use Contracts precluded recourse to local courts and instead
obliged parties to arbitrate disputes before the SCC. The logical extension of
Respondent’s argument would lead to the absurd result of requiring KPM and TNG
to file one SCC claim before a new tribunal and then for Claimants to file a
separate action before the SCC. (C-II 456).

In any event, resort to local remedies would have been futile. This is not a matter
concerning a single act of low level maladministration, but rather these cases stem
from treaty violations perpetrated at the highest level of the Kazakh government.
No Kazakh court would overturn an expropriation ordered at the highest levels of
Kazakhstan’s government. (C-II {{[ 457 — 458).

In its Post-Hearing submission, Claimants argued that there is direct evidence that
the executive mandated the takings at issue. This is true despite Minister
Mynbayev’s testimony that the MEMR was actually attempting to protect KPM
and TNG against the Kazakh authorities. In his position having direct authority
over KPM’s and TNG’s operations, he had in depth knowledge that the companies
would need protection from higher authorities. The evidence and testimony before
the Tribunal strongly suggests the direct involvement of Kazakhstan’s political
elite. (CPHB 1 {{f[ 309 — 339).

c. Indirect Expropriation

i. General Principles and
Jurisprudence Regarding Indirect
Expropriation

“Indirect expropriation” is widely understood as interference with an investment
that “Jeaves the investor’s title untouched but deprives him of the possibility to
utilize the investment in a meaningful way”, i.e. depriving the investor of its rights
or attributes of ownership, without physically seizing the property. (C-I {{{[ 259 —
269; C-II § 469). The present case does not concern a “creeping” expropriation
where numerous small events cumulatively amounted to an indirect expropriation.
Rather, the measures were extreme and any number of them individually
constitutes an act of indirect expropriation under international law. Cumulatively,
the conclusion that Kazakhstan indirectly expropriated Claimants’ investments is
inescapable. (C-I | 285; CPHB 2 { 36).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 236 of 415
Page 235 of 414

1112.Respondent substantially deprived Claimants of the rights of ownership of their
investments. There is a generous amount of jurisprudence describing the kinds of
acts that can amount to indirect expropriation, which is often defined as a
substantial deprivation of the rights or attributes of ownership of an investment.
The deprivations and impacts that resulted from Kazakhstan’s mistreatment of
KPM and TNG over from October 2008 — July 2010 resemble those summarized
by the tribunal in PSEG v. Turkey, when it summarized these constitutive aspects
of an indirect expropriation:

[T]here must be some form of deprivation of the investor in the control of
the investment, the management of day-to-day operations of the company,
interfering in the administration, impeding the distribution of dividends,
interfering in the appointment of officials and managers, or depriving the
company of its property or control in total or in part. (C-II {J 474 — 476,
partially quoted).

1113.Investment tribunals have routinely found that substantial interference with an
investor’s ability to manage its investment entails indirect expropriation. Contrary
to Respondent’s argument, Claimants were not at fault for the start of these
investigations. Respondent never alleged that KPM or TNG had violated the law
before that date. Rather, the investigations were a pretext for Kazakhstan to
prosecute Claimants’ companies and ultimately gain control over them.
Kazakhstan invented those grounds as early as November 2008, when the Financial
Police reclassified the pipelines and ordered calculation of KPM’s “illegal” profits
(i.e., all of its revenues over the previous several years). The Court ignored and
declared inadmissible evidence in Mr. Cornegruta’s favor, and ignored the obvious
fact that the “illegal profits” calculated as the penalty were actually not profits at
all but were revenues, and were not even earned by Mr. Cornegruta. There should
be no question that Kazakhstan’s actions, which were carried out in bad faith,
amount to indirect expropriation under the ECT and international law (C-II {{{ 479
— 480, partially quoted; CPHB 2 {{{[ 97 — 100).

ii. Right to Regulate

1114. Respondent’s arguments that its actions from October 2008 — July 2010 were a
proper exercise of its regulatory powers fail for the simple reason that its actions
were not regulatory in nature. In this regard, Claimants state as follows:

470. _ [...] Kazakhstan’s actions amounting to an indirect expropriation [...] did
not stem from enactment of new laws or regulations or the legitimate
enforcement of existing regulations, and they were not designed to
maintain “public order, health, or morality.” Instead, they consisted of
an egregious campaign of harassment and coercion designed to undermine
and interfere with Claimants’ management and control of KPM and TNG.
The campaign involved a multitude of ministries led by the Financial
Police, and it culminated in extraordinary denials of justice suffered by
Mr. Cornegruta and KPM in the Kazakh courts. The campaign was
carried out under an order from President Nazarbayev to investigate Mr.
Stati. Far from being necessary to protect or promote a legitimate State
interest, the Government’s campaign intentionally interfered with
Claimants’ ability to manage, control, and dispose of their investments and

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 237 of 415

472.

473.

Page 236 of 414

was designed to force Claimants to sell KPM and TNG (or parts of the
companies) to the State at bargain-basement prices. [...]

Moreover, even if Kazakhstan could show a legitimate purpose for its so-
called “regulatory” conduct, and that its conduct was necessary and
proportional to achieving that purpose, Kazakhstan would still be required
to pay compensation to Claimants for its expropriatory measures. [...]

Thus, even if Kazakhstan’s measures could be said to fall within the scope
of normal, regulatory actions — which is vehemently denied — their
devastating impact on Claimants’ investments was to such a degree as to
require compensation from Kazakhstan. — Kazakhstan’s failure to
compensate Claimants alone establishes the unlawful nature of its indirect
expropriation. (C-II {Jf 471 — 473, partially quoted).

1115.The case law cited by Respondent is inapplicable here, as those cases concern
states that actually took regulatory measures that tribunals found to be tied to a
legitimate state interest.

471.

[...] In Tecmed, Mexico refused to renew the claimants’ landfill permit on
environmental protection grounds, which the tribunal found to fall within
the state’s regulatory powers (but which the Tribunal nevertheless found to
amount to expropriation). Further, the Glamis Gold case involved
application of the U.S.’s environmental protection laws, which were
designed to promote public health and safety and therefore were proper
regulatory measures; the Methanex case dealt with a ban on the MTBE
additive in gasoline, which was a necessary regulatory measure to
maintain public health and safety; and the LG&E tribunal found that a
measure that has a social or general welfare purpose may be accepted
when it proportionally addresses an blished need. Kazakh has not
even articulated what public purpose was served by its complete
devastation of Claimants’ investments through its harassment campaign
and denials of justice, much less demonstrated that its measures were
necessary and proportional to achieve such a purpose. (C-II { 471).

1116.The Tribunal does not need to abandon common sense. All of the legal and
regulatory problems faced by KPM and TNG arise in the context of President
Nazarbayev’s October 2008 order and had never been experienced previously.
(CPHB 2 § 40). The events following President Nazarbayev’s 14 October 2008
Order were not a coincidence. To argue so is to state that none of Kazakhstan’s
regulatory bodies had successfully carried out their functions for nearly a decade,
by missing all of these serious infractions. The Tribunal should recognize that the
acts described below were designed to (and successfully did) discourage third party
buyers from paying FMV for Claimants’ assets and required an inordinate amount
of time and expense to (unsuccessfully) challenge before Kazakhstan’s various
administrative and judicial bodies. (C-I { 278; CPHB 2 {J 41 — 43, 52 — 57).

iii, Acts Allegedly Amounting to An
Indirect Expropriation

1117.Kazakhstan’s measures from October 2008 to July 2010 interfered with Claimants’
use and control of their investments and caused significant damage to the

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 238 of 415

Page 237 of 414

alienability and economic potential of those investments. (C-I {| 270; CPHB 2 {[

38, 40).

271.

Kazakhstan’s campaign of indirect expropriation commenced on October
14, 2008, when President Nazarbayev personally ordered the Kazakh
Financial Police and a variety of other Governmental agencies to “fully
investigate” Claimants’ business activities in Kazakhstan. The Financial
Police and seven other ministries and agencies started their harassment
campaign in earnest on the heels of President Nazarbayev’s directive.
Kazakhstan’s harassment campaign — which included a groundless
criminal prosecution and conviction of KPM’s in-country manager (and a
similarly groundless criminal verdict against KPM), freezing KPM’s
assets, multiple assessments of improper taxes, reversal of prior State
approvals and waiver of the State’s pre-emptive rights, and refusal to
execute the agreed exploration period extension — entail “indirect”
expropriation under Article 13 of the ECT and international law. (C-I {
271; CPHB 1 4 112, stating that the difference between “thoroughly
check”, as Respondent translates, and “thoroughly investigate” is a
difference without distinction. Claimants later use “thoroughly check” in
their memorial at CPHB 2 { 115).

1118.The events following President Nazarbayev’s 14 October 2008 Order were not a
coincidence. The measures described below discouraged third party buyers from
paying FMV for Claimants’ assets and required an inordinate amount of time and
expense to (unsuccessfully) challenge before Kazakhstan’s various administrative
and judicial bodies (C-I { 278; CPHB 2 {41 — 43, 52 — 57):

273.

274.

[The first measure taken against Claimants was Kazakhstan's refusal to
extend the exploration for the Contract 302 properties. This wrongful
refusal to execute prevented Claimants from proving the Contract 302
Properties’ reserves and thereby affected the market value of that asset.
This occurred after Claimants had begun to accept bids for the sale of
KPM and TNG. To the extent that Kazakhstan argues that Contract 302
terminated on its own accord, Claimants state that it only terminated
because of the State’s refusal to extend, which was not in accordance with
the contractual termination provisions. (see also CPHB 2 {J 149 — 176)]

[[T]he Financial Police effectively commandeered KPM’s and TNG’s
offices for months, from late October 2008 until March 2009, while they
oversaw iS. inspecti¢ intimidated loyees, seized pany
documents, and prevented KPM’s and TNG’s personnel from carrying out
their normal daily activities. Those inspections substantially interfered
with the day-to-day management and operations of the companies. (C-II {
476)]

[In] November 2008, [...] the Tax Committee initiated an audit of KPM
and TNG and assessed approximately USD 6 million in back “transfer”
price taxes and penalties. KPM and TNG spent the following months
contesting this assessment in Kazakhstan’s courts, legal actions that
remained pending at the time Kazakhstan abrogated KPM’s and TNG’s
Subsoil Use Contracts and directly expropriated Claimants’ investments in
July 2010.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 239 of 415
Page 238 of 414

275. [...] The February 10, 2009, refusal by Kazakhstan to apply amortization
rates as contractually agreed in the KPM and TNG Subsoil Use Contracts
raised additional concerns about the companies’ financial health. The
State wrongfully assessed against the companies approximately USD 69
million in back taxes on corporate income and associated penalties. In
early 2010, the State pursued bankruptcy proceedings against KPM,
further disrupting KPM’s ability to operate and driving down the value of
Claimants’ investments.

276. On December 18, 2008, the State reversed its earlier position and
cancelled its prior approval of the 2003 transfer of TNG to Terra Raf, as
well as its prior waiver of pre-emptive rights to purchase 100% of KPM
and TNG, all amidst threats of termination of the Subsoil Use Contracts.
Despite the Government’s verbal assurances, it never granted the permit to
“re-allow” the transfer of TNG’s ownership to Terra Raf. From
December 2008 onward, the lingering transfer and pre-emptive rights
issues consumed an extraordinary amount of time, attention, and
resources, and severely affected the marketability of TNG and KPM.
[Kazakhstan’s arbitrary reversal of its pre-emptive rights waiver, as well
as its false announcements of “irregularities” at the companies and its
later seizures of KPM’s and TNG’s assets, deprived Claimants of their
ability to dispose of their investments.]

277. [...] On September 30, 2009, the State revived a dispute with KPM
regarding payment of the explicitly inapplicable Crude Oil Export Tax for
KPM'’s January 2009 exports, resulting in a purported financial penalty of
over USD 10 million. (C-I {273 — 277, partially quoted; C-I 1] 476 —
478, partially quoted; CPHB 2 {J 115 — 139).

1119. The measures described above pale in comparison to the criminal proceedings that
Kazakhstan waged against KPM, TNG, and their personnel. Claimants’ employees
were harassed and intimidated. They were coerced into signing inspection reports.
Their families were intimidated. This harassment was in violation of the ECT.
The baseless reclassification of KPM’s and TNG’s pipelines into trunk pipelines
was the basis for Kazakhstan’s prosecution of Mr. Cornegruta, and for
Kazakhstan’s “conviction” of KPM. Numerous expert reports were generated that
confirmed by common sense that these pipelines had been wrongfully reclassified,
and these were all rejected by the court. (C-I {{[ 279 — 280; CPHB 2 {ff 48 - 51).

1120.The harassment and coercion constituted an illegal indirect expropriation by
depriving Claimants of their incidents of ownership of KPM and TNG. (CPHB 2 {
59). The constant investigations and then the conviction of Mr. Cornegruta and
KPM seriously impaired the value of Claimants’ investments, in a manner similar
to those considered in the Biloune case, though more severe. The criminal
proceeding cost Claimants considerably and severely impaired Claimants’ right
and ability to manage their investments, in particular in light of the hours and
resources spent preparing Mr. Cornegruta’s defense, as well as his and KPM’s
appeals. Kazakhstan callously argues that the imprisonment of Mr. Cornegruta had
no impact on the Claimants’ ability to operate their companies. Despite the fact
that the Kazakh court specifically found (as if such a fact were in doubt) that while
Mr. Cornegruta was in jail he “could not fulfill any obligations related to the

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 240 of 415

1121.

1122.

1123.

Page 239 of 414

management of [KPM and TNG],” his arrest and imprisonment also caused other
high-level KPM and TNG managers and personnel to flee the country, forcing
Claimants to manage KPM and TNG remotely. There is, therefore, no question that
Kazakhstan substantially interfered with Claimants’ ability to manage KPM and
TNG. (C-I ff 282 — 284; C-II{ 477; CPHB 2 {| 52 — 56).

281. In conjunction with this case, the Financial Police issued seizure orders
against (i) KPM’s Subsoil Use Contract, oilfield pipelines, and vehicles;
(ii) TNG’s Subsoil Use Contracts, and oilfield gas and condensate
pipelines; and (iii) Claimants’ participatory interests in KPM and TNG.
These seizures were designed to prevent KPM and TNG from selling or
transferring their assets during the course of the criminal proceedings,
thereby preventing Claimants from disposing of their investments in
Kazakhstan. Needless to say, those seizures and the criminal case
massively interfered with Claimants’ ability to enjoy or dispose of their
investments, and they further diminished their market value. (C-I { 281,
partially quoted).

Kazakhstan’s attempts to enforce its “fabricated” USD 145 million fine against
KPM also resulted in the inalienability of Claimants’ investments. The seizure of
Claimants’ operations interfered with rights under the Subsoil Use Contracts,
measures that the CME and Alpha Tribunals deemed to be expropriatory. Those
execution measures also led to the flight of more key personnel and further
paralyzed Claimants’ operations in Kazakhstan. (C-I { 284).

Respondent’s actions, described above, placed a “cloud” over Claimants’ title to
TNG. With KPM facing a pre-ordained conviction, a baseless USD 62 million
back tax assessment, and this cloud hanging over TNG, no investor could be
expected to purchase the companies. Claimants also argue that Respondent
maliciously defamed Claimants by disclosing information to INTERFAX. These
public allegations of forgery and fraud exacerbated the above mentioned injuries,
and made it difficult for Claimants to obtaining financing for their projects at
reasonable rates. (CPHB | {{f[ 138 — 145, 214 — 220, 346 — 357).

Three baseless tax disputes — concerning assessments of back corporate income
taxes, transfer pricing, and oil export duties — formed part of Kazakhstan’s
onslaught of harassment that commenced immediately after October 14, 2008. The
“comprehensive tax audit” that the Financial Police ordered in October 2008 gave
rise to no valid complaint regarding the companies’ tax payments or filings. So at
the urging of the Financial Police, the Tax and Customs Committees simply
created baseless claims. First, in November 2008, the Customs Committee claimed
that a previous, disputed assessment of oil export duties, in an amount exceeding
USD 10 million, should be paid, despite both an initial court ruling and a previous
concession from the Customs Committee that the companies were contractually
exempt from such duties. Second, in February 2009, the Tax Committee claimed
that KPM and TNG owed USD 62 million in corporate back taxes for failing to
properly deduct drilling expenses. Third, in December 2009, it claimed that KPM
and TNG owed USD 5 million in back transfer pricing taxes. None of these three
claims had any merit, but were instead spurious assessment whose only purpose
was to harass Claimants and to pressure them to sell KPM and TNG to the state at
firesale prices. (CPHB 2 {| 127 — 134, 137).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 241 of 415

1124.

1125.

1126.

1127.

Page 240 of 414

As of 21 July 2010, the Kazakh courts resolved the corporate back tax dispute and
ruled that KPM and TNG owed no such taxes. Thus, Kazakhstan’s assertion in its
First Post-Hearing Brief that this claim continued to increase “until the valuation
date of 21 July 2010” is patently wrong. To the contrary, as of July 21, 2010,
KPM’s and TNG’s corporate back tax liability was zero (CPHB 2 § 135).
Kazakhstan revived the matter after July 2010 in bad faith, thereby ensuring that
Claimants would have no ability to defend their position before the Kazakh
Supreme Court (whose decision, in any event, was substantively incorrect).
(CPHB 2 {{ 136).

Despite the Supreme Court ordering taxes due from KPM’s and TNG’s purported
trust manager in November 2010, no collection efforts have been undertaken.
Thus, it is likely that these tax actions were simply part of Kazakhstan’s
coordinated attack on Claimants’ investments. Along with Kazakhstan’s other acts
of harassment and coercion, the tax assessments were measures that, in the words
of the RosInvest tribunal, were “linked to the strategic objective of returning
petroleum assets to the control of the [State] and to an effort to suppress [an
investor].” Because that tribunal found that the State’s measures were “structured
in such a way to remove [the investment company’s] assets from the control of [the
investors],” it concluded that the State had committed an illegal, indirect
expropriation. The Tribunal should not hesitate to reach the same conclusion here.
(CPHB 2 {ff 137 — 138).

In order for the Tribunal to find that Kazakhstan breached the ECT and owes
compensation to Claimants, the Tribunal need only be satisfied that the
Kazakhstan’s actions were unlawful and harmed Claimants’ investments. While
Kazakhstan’s actions clearly demonstrated an intention to devalue, impair, and
harm Claimants’ investments from October 2008 onward, Respondent’s intention
is relevant for determining the valuation date. (CPHB 2 {| 44 — 45). The wrongful
verdict against KPM and its assets was a measure of “indirect expropriation”, since
the enforcement destroyed what little remained of Claimants’ “incidents of
ownership” over KPM by that time. (CPHB 2 ff 97 — 114).

d. _ Direct Expropriation
i. Transfer of Title

“Direct” expropriation refers to the overt seizure of a foreign investor’s property or
the title to such property by the host state. Respondent’s argument that a formal
transfer of title to the state or to a third party nominated by the state is “the decisive
element” for the Tribunal in finding a direct, rather than an indirect, expropriation
occurred is wrong as a matter of law. (C-I {[[ 249 — 252; C-II 459). Claimants’
arguments are best taken from their own words:

460. The Santa Elena case, on which Claimants rely for this (undisputed)
principle of international law, was cited with approval by the Telnor v.
Hungary tribunal. It quoted the Santa Elena finding that “[t]here is ample
authority for the proposition that a property has been expropriated when
the effect of measures taken by the state has been to deprive the owner of
title, possession, or access to the benefit and economic use of his
property.” The Metalclad tribunal similarly found that expropriation

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 242 of 415
Page 241 of 414

includes “open, deliberate and acknowledged takings of property, such as
outright seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in favor of the host
State.” Likewise, the Tecmed tribunal explained, “[u]nder international
law, [direct expropriation occurs] where the use or enjoyment of benefits
related thereto is exacted or interfered with . . . even where legal
ownership over the assets in question is not affected. Thus, there is
no requirement that Kazakhstan must have received title to Claimants’
investments in order for this Tribunal to find that a direct expropriation
occurred.

 

461. Kazakhstan admits that Claimants’ legal ownership of KPM and TNG and
their assets were substantially affected and transferred to State control. It
explains that “[u]pon termination of the Subsoil Use Contracts, the
ownership rights of KPM and TNG automatically ceased to exist” and
“the assets then had to be transferred to [State-owned KazMunaiGaz] so
that they would be taken into trust management.” That alone is sufficient
to establish expropriation. By Kazakhstan’s own case, Claimants lost their
contracts and all the assets of KPM and TNG. That is precisely the kind of
taking the Sempra tribunal, on which Kazakhstan relies, had in mind when
it held that a direct expropriation requires that “at least some essential
component of the property right has been transferred to a different
beneficiary.” (C-II 1] 460 — 461).

1128. It is beyond dispute that Kazakhstan directly expropriated Claimants’ investments
on 21-22 July 2010 by seizing Claimants’ rights under the Subsoil Use Contracts
and by seizing legal and physical control of the assets held by Claimants through
KPM and TNG. The act of transferring Claimants’ KPM and TNG Subsoil Use
Contracts to KMG, as well as the subsoil area subject to those contracts was a
compulsory transfer of title to property to the State. (C-I {{f[ 253 — 254, CPHB 2 {[
196). As Respondent has confirmed, from the moment of termination, Claimants’
contractual rights to ownership over the produced oil, gas, and condensate was
terminated. Further, the MOG’s and KMG’s occupation of Claimants’ offices and
transfer of personnel and assets totally deprived Claimants of physical possession
and control of their revenues, assets, and means of production. Claimants’
description of the transfer of legal title is as follows:

256. — Those seizures of legal title were personally instructed and overseen by the
Kazakh Prime Minister, along with the Minister of Oil and Gas and the
regional Governor, during their visit to Claimants’ LPG plant to announce
the seizures. The following day, Kazakhstan seized physical control of
Claimants’ investments. On July 22, 2010, Kazakhstan seized Claimants’
offices, equipment, production, revenue, and other investments and
operations, when a group of thirteen high-ranking officials from the MOG
and KazMunaiGas arrived at Claimants’ offices in Aktau, Kazakhstan.
KazMunaiGas explained that government escrow 's were being
opened the same day, and “everything that has been extracted since [July]
22nd, extracted oil and payment for oil, gas and condensate - such income
shall be deposited in the special account.” The MOG’s and
KazMunaiGas’ occupation of Claimants’ offices and transfer of personnel
and assets totally deprived Claimants of physical possession and control of
their revenues, assets, and means of production. (C-I 256).

 

   

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 243 of 415

Page 242 of 414

1129. Indeed, such an outright seizure of physical assets, contractual rights, and legal title
are textbook examples of “direct” expropriation. Hence, it is indisputable that
Kazakhstan directly expropriated Claimants’ investments under Art. 13 ECT and
international law in July 2010. (C-I {{[ 255 — 257; CPHB 2 {fj 178 — 179).

ii. Exercise of Regulatory Powers

1130. Respondent’s argument that the unilateral termination of the Subsoil Use Contracts
and its takeover of the companies was merely a normal exercise of its regulatory
powers is fanciful, at best. (C-II { 462).

464.

463.

Unilaterally terminating contracts and seizing rights and property are not
the types of exercise of regulatory powers that normally exculpate a state

from responsibility for harming investments protected by a treaty. Prima
facie state measures comprising a lawful exercise of regulatory powers

include taxation, trade restrictions, and/or measures of devaluation. But
the outright taking of rights and property from an investor and transferring
it to a State company — even if on a “trust management” basis until a
third subsoil user can be found — is altogether different from regulating
an interest of the state.

Kazakhstan claims that its expropriatory acts were regulatory because
they were in accordance with its Subsoil Law of 2010, the purpose of
which was “to balance the host State's legitimate interest in furthering the
wealth and well-being of its popul and the i ‘s” iti

interest in making a return on its investment.” Further, Kazakhstan
contends that its regulatory powers under that Law require it to ensure
that “investors [do not] take over the gas and oil production on a certain

field forever but that production rights are tied to contracts which expire

and have to be renegotiated regularly.” (C-II 1] 463 — 464).

1131.Furthermore, the takeover was at odds with the interests allegedly expressed in the
Subsoil Use Law. The takeover did not provide balance — like what may have been
prior to 2008, when Claimants earned a return on their investments and paid taxes
according to the Subsoil Use Contracts. After October 2008, there was no balance,
as Respondent gradually took everything and left Claimants with nothing. The
expropriation was aimed solely at expropriating the benefits of Claimants’
production rights after Claimants had invested all the necessary time and money to
make the fields productive. The July 2010 expropriation was largely a formality,
formalizing Respondent’s campaign of indirect expropriation. (C-II {{{[ 465 — 468).

1132.In any event, Respondent cannot merely point to its domestic law to legalize its
expropriation by way of the regulatory powers doctrine because Respondent would
still be required to compensate Claimants for the taking. The Parties do not dispute
that Respondent has paid no compensation to Claimants. (C-II {| 466).

1133.Respondent has been unable to point to any contemporaneously made allegation
that would have supported its position. Instead, the justifications for the
expropriation are based on snippets of witness testimony, which are contradicted
by the contemporaneous evidence. (CPHB 2 {| 179 — 180).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 244 of 415
Page 243 of 414

1134. First, Minister Mynbayev’s testimony at the October 2012 Hearing confirmed that
the public policy grounds alleged do not justify the termination. He admitted that
the inspections concluded that Claimants were in compliance with their subsoil use
contract obligations. The reports also confirmed that Claimants exceeded their
minimum work program for 1999 — 2009 by 6.6 times. For 2010, the MEMR
noted that TNG had exceeded its contractual obligations by 3.4 times. (CPHB 2 {If
178 — 184). In any event, the alleged “violations” did not merit termination of the
contracts. Three of the seven alleged violations against KPM were that it failed to
satisfy financial obligations toward Kazakhstan. At the hearing, Claimants
corrected the Respondent that KPM was accused of owing USD 114 thousand to
Kazakhstan — not USD 114 million. KPM was accused of owing USD 10,000 for
the liquidation and a vague amount in taxes, which KPM disputed and would not
have been able to pay since the accounts were frozen. The other four grounds were
completely baseless. These included that (a) KPM failed to train Kazakh
specialists (at the hearing, Minister Mynbayev could not explain why this would be
a valid ground for termination), (b) that KPM failed to provide information about
compliance with the work program, (c) that it had breached obligations regarding
the acquisition of goods, works, and services, and (d) that it operated a main
pipeline without a license. The six allegations against TNG for Contract 210 were
likewise meritless:

 

 

 

288. [...] Like KPM, TNG explained that information regarding fulfillment of its
work programs had been sent to Kazakhstan on multiple previous
occasions. Kazakhstan also accused TNG of failing to provide annexes
regarding the training of employees. TNG explained that those had been
provided, along with its annual reports, and TNG provided them again in
its July 19, 2010 response. TNG also explained that, like KPM, it had
written to the Ministry of Oil and Gas to determine where to send its excess
funds for training Kazakh specialists, which the Ministry ignored. In
response to the claim that TNG owed some US $84,000 in historic costs,
TNG explained and demonstrated that it properly paid its historic costs on
a quarterly basis and that it had no arrears. TNG also explained, just as
KPM had done, that it did not operate a main pipeline and that it had not
breached any obligations for the acquisition of goods, works, or services.

289. Amazingly, Kazakhstan also issued a notice of alleged violations with
respect to TNG’s Contract No. 302. Kazakhstan claimed that TNG had
violated Contract No. 302 on five grounds: (i) the same alleged failure to
provide information regarding its work program; (ii) the same supposed
failure to provide annexes regarding employee training; (iii) the same
contention that TNG had not trained Kazakh specialists; (iv) the false
criminal allegation that TNG operated a main pipeline without a license;
and (v) the same vague obligation that TNG had breached its obligations
regarding the acquisition of goods, works, and services. (CPHB I {ff 273
— 289, partially quoted).

1135.Respondent’s allegation that the Table 1-p in the English version of the MEMR
inspection report, which was not provided due to a cut-off in printing, showed
underperformance and mismanagement of the business is incorrect. The Russian
version was provided and the missing English section does not provide any

evidence of non-compliance with contract obligations or Kazakh law. (CPHB 2 {If
184 — 185).

Respondent’s selective reliance on the PwC due diligence report is also unavailing.
That report indicated that TNG had fallen behind on its 2008 and 2009 aspirational
work programs. The MEMR also recognized that the company’s aspirational
working program was not the same as their minimum work obligations. Mr. Lungu
admitted to no breach of the minimum work programmes, but was instead referring
to the companies’ own more aggressive annual work program. And this is
consistent with Claimants’ historic over-fulfillment of their minimum work
requirements. (CPHB 2 {{{[ 187 — 188).

By summer 2009, TNG had reduced gas production in Tolkyn and this was noted
by the MEMR - who did not find that the reduction amounted to a violation of
contract or law. The reason for the reduction in production was due to the loss of
Kemikal as a contractual partner (due to Respondent’s harassment campaign) and
the fact that the LPG Plant was not completed. In any event, the production slump
was temporary and the production and sale of gas increased during winter 2009.
(CPHB 2 {ff 189 — 190).

Even if there had been non-compliance with the minimum work obligations in
2009, it would be immaterial, since (i) MEMR expressly stated that there were no
problems in the field as of February 2010 and that “any falldown [or non-
compliance] for certain years is compensated by the significant exceedings
registered in the next or previous years;” (ii) any failure to meet minimum work
obligations would have been solely as a result of Kazakhstan’s harassment and
interference with Claimants’ normal business operations; and (iii) any minimal
“falldown” that may have existed was not sufficient to terminate the contracts,
because it was not a reason the MOG gave for contract termination in July 2010.
(CPHB 2 {ff 191 — 193).

Kazakhstan has provided no contemporaneous evidence that mass employee
dismissals were a serious concern or that there was a risk of social tension. The
opposite was confirmed in Mr. Calancea’s, Mr. Condorachi’s, and Mr.
Ongarbayev’s testimony. Payment was even made when the accounts were frozen.
Upon the government’s take over, 900 workers went to work for the state. (CPHB
24 194).

Kazakhstan’s claims that Claimants were unwilling to cooperate with the State to
cure contract breaches are misleading, given that Claimants had a mere 3 days to
cure the alleged breaches and, as indicated above, by the time of the expropriation,
Claimants had been appealing to multiple Government agencies since late 2008.
Further attempts would have been futile. (CPHB 2 {| 195).

Importantly, in Minister Mynbayev’s testimony, it was revealed the allegations for
breach of Contract 302 actually reveal that Kazakhstan considered that it had been
extended, because otherwise it would have expired in March 2009. Furthermore,
since it was an exploration contract, Claimants did not own or operate any transport
pipelines. (CPHB 1 {{{ 290 — 292).

2. Arguments by Respondent

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 246 of 415
Page 245 of 414

a. Law on Expropriation
1142. Respondent agrees that expropriation is governed by Art. 13 ECT. (R-I 33.4).

1143.Respondent also highlights that expropriation needs to be differentiated from valid
government activity. Respondent implies that, since no expropriation occurred, the
four factors presented in Art. 13 ECT are irrelevant. Quoting Marvin Feldman v.
Mexico, Respondent states that “the essential determination is whether the actions
of the Mexican Stil an expropriation or nationalization, or are
valid governmental activity. If there is no expropriatory action, factors a-d [i.e. (a)
for a public purpose; (b) on a non-discriminatory basis; (c) in accordance with due
process of law and article 1105(1); and (d) on payment of compensation] are of
limited relevance, except to the extent that they have helped to differentiate
between governmental acts that are expropriation and those that are not (...).” (R-
IE { 892).

 

1144. Respondent committed no due process violations with respect to the non-extension
of Contract 302 and the 9 April 2009 letter did not oblige the MEMR to enter into
an addendum for Contract 302. Claimants are incorrect to allege that Messrs.
Mynbayev and Ongarbaev supported Claimants’ interpretation of the 9 April 2009
letter. Mr. Ongarbaev never testified that MEMR had decided to extend Contract
302, but rather than the decision to recommend extension was made. (RPHB 2 {ff
296 — 305). Minister Mynbayev’s testimony was mistranslated:

304. | When Minister Mynbaev explained that the decision of the Export
Commission had only recommendatory character, he was
translated to have said that it gave recommendations as to whether
the subsoil user may count on the extension or not. However, the
Russian verb «paccgHTbIBaTb Ha» translated into English as
“count on” was used by the witness in the ordinary meaning of
«HageATbcA Ha», or English “hope for’. And certainly, a
decision of recommendatory nature may raise hopes but it cannot
give rise to legitimate expectations. (RPHB 2 {{ 304, emphasis in
original).

1145.Claimants created the irregularities in the title to TNG when they wrongly asserted
that Respondent’s pre-emptive rights did not apply to the Gheso — Terra Raf
transfer. There were 8 transfers involving a majority interest in TNG, and the
consequence of failure to obtain consent in any of those transfers is that none of the
transfers involving Claimants’ companies were completed. The belated consent to
one transfer does not cure all previous failures to obtain consent. (RPHB 2 {| 272
— 281).

b. Exhaustion of Remedies

1146.Respondent argues that Claimants’ expropriation arguments are precluded by
Claimants’ failure to pursue available remedies in pursuance of their contractual
claims or domestic legal claims. After every alleged action, KPM and TNG could
have turned to the contractually agreed upon arbitral tribunals or to the Republic’s
domestic courts, and they chose not to do so. (R-I J 33.6; R-II { 865).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 247 of 415
Page 246 of 414

1147. Turning first to Claimants’ contractual claims and citing Waste Management and
Parkerings v. Lithuania, Respondent presents that an expropriation of contractual
rights is not perfected until available remedies to address the alleged contractual
breach have been pursued. (R-I {{[ 33.7 — 33.10; R-II {ff 865 - 866).

1148. Claimants’ claims for actions making up the direct expropriation and many claims
regarding the indirect expropriation are contractual in nature. These actions
include (1) the refusal to prolong Contract 302, (2) the termination of Contract 302,
(3) the Republic’s alleged refusal to apply contractually agreed amortization rates
leading to an assessment of back taxes and penalties of USD 69 million, (4) the
alleged non-application of a contractually agreed exemption to the Crude Oil
Export Tax, and (5) the alleged revocation of the Republic’s purported approval of
the transfer of TNG to Terra Raf. These claims each fail for the simple reason that
in each and every case, the Claimants — alone or through TNG and KPM - could
and should have pursued these claims by way of arbitration, as agreed in the
Subsoil Use Contracts and Contract 302. To be clear: the present arbitration does
not satisfy the contractual requirements. (R-I {| 33.17 — 33.22; R-I { 33.22
represents that KPM and TNG would be suing).

1149.In respect of domestic law, so long as the state provides effective remedies for
breaches of domestic law, an expropriation cannot occur so long as the investor’s
attempts at pursuing those remedies have not failed. Respondent cites Generation
Ukraine v. Ukraine and EnCana v. Ecuador in support of this position and
summarizes that there have been several reasons that lead tribunals consider that a
failure to pursue available remedies is fatal to an expropriation claim:

(a) Non-performance of a contract - and thus also termination of a contract -
does not amount to an expropriation of the rights stemming from the
contract as long as the loss of the right is not final, i.e. ultimately
determined by the appropriate forum.

(b) An act of maladministration at the lowest level cannot amount to an
expropriation. Otherwise, investors could invoke any minor mistake at the
local level and bring investment arbitration claims.

(c) Tribunals generally are less knowledgeable about domestic law than
domestic courts. Thus, in the absence of a valid reason for a failure to
bring the claim to the appropriate forum, such failure puts into doubt that
a right was actually taken from the investor. (R-I {J 33.10 — 33.15;
quoting J 33.15).

1150.Claimants’ other indirect expropriation claims could have and should have been
addressed in domestic courts, which were open to Claimants. Claimants never
pursued all available appeals against lower-instance decisions. (R-I {{{[ 33.23 —
33.26; RPHB 2 {{{[ 265 — 271). With regard to the prosecution of KPM, Claimants
never exhausted the appeals system within the Republic, which stood open to
Claimants. KPM missed the deadline to appeal. It was the Court’s view that KPM
had notice of the decision against it, since its senior management was present at the
hearing. (R-II {{ 635 — 638). This excludes the notion of expropriation. (R-I {|
34.9).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 248 of 415
Page 247 of 414

1151.Claimants’ position that the contracts precluded them from submitting breaches of
contract to domestic courts is untenable. Claimants base their allegation that
Contracts 210 and 302 provided for arbitration before the SCC was based on an
alleged footnote in Maiden Suleymenov’s chapter in “Oil and Gas Law in
Kazakhstan.” Suleymenov, however, states the opposite of what Claimants allege.
(R-II {| 870 — 873).

874. — Article 28 (2) of Contract No. 305 does indeed refer the parties, i.e. KPM
and the Republic, to the SCC. However, the requirement for KPM to refer
disputes to the SCC does not mean that “KPM and TNG would first have
to commence arbitration proceedings at the Stockholm Chamber of
Commerce for another international tribunal to determine whether
Kazakhstan’s actions amount to a breach of contract under Kazakh law”.
Firstly, only KPM is a party to Contract No. 305. Secondly, Claimants
seem to suggest that the tribunal in the SCC proceedings would need to
render a declaratory award in favor of KPM and on that basis, Claimants
could then pursue their claim under the ECT. This is clearly not the case.
Instead, there would only be two proceedings if KPM were unsuccessful in
the SCC arbitration and Claimants then decided to pursue their claim
under the ECT nonetheless. This is not at all “absurd”. (R-II { 874,
emphasis maintained).

1152.Respondent states that, having shown that remedies were available, it is for
Claimants to prove their assertion that resort to local remedies would have been
futile. Claimants have not even alleged that recourse to arbitration for the acts that
they consider to be “indirect” expropriation would have been futile. The Republic
refutes Claimants’ contention that arbitration as a remedy against termination of
the contracts would have been futile from the outset. Furthermore, Claimants have
not explained why a tribunal constituted pursuant to the Subsoil Use Contracts
would not have addressed their complaints. Finally, regarding Claimants’ final
futility argument regarding maladministration, Claimants cannot base any
argument on their allegation that the termination notices were a result of a
notification by the President of the Republic, which they were not. (R-II {{] 875 —
878).

1153.Claimants misrepresent the contents of the decision taken in the He/nan annulment.
Helnan was not an easy, one-way decision, but it was a quite nuanced ruling,
striking a balance between an investor’s interest in pursuing treaty arbitration and a
state’s interest in not being held liable for decisions of low-ranking officials. In
pertinent part, that Tribunal stated “Of course, a claimant's prospects of success in
pursuing a treaty claim based on the decision of an inferior official or court, which
had not been challenged through an available appeal process, should be lower,
since the tribunal must in any event be satisfied that the failure is one which
displays insufficiency in the system, justifying international intervention.” (R-II {]]
866 — 867).

1154. Claimants allege that the Republic has failed to differentiate between treaty claims
and contract claims. In response, Respondent state that, “/o/bviously, a claim
under a treaty is something quite different to a claim under a contract. However,
this in no way precludes the fact that available remedies have to be pursued.” (R-
II { 869).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 249 of 415
Page 248 of 414

1155.In response to Claimants’ fork-in-the-road argument, Respondent explains that
TNG and KPM ~ as distinct parties from Claimants in this arbitration, needed to
have pursued their own contractual remedies, prior to Claimants’ initiation of
proceedings. This would not have triggered the fork-in-the-road clause for
Claimants, as was explicitly held in CMS v. Argentina.

c. Indirect Expropriation

i. General Principles and
Jurisprudence Regarding Indirect
Expropriation

1156.Indirect expropriation describes the rare situation in which no transfer of title
occurs but the host State’s measures nonetheless are “santamount” to expropriation
or have an equivalent effect. (R-I [ 35.2). The main criterion for a finding of an
indirect expropriation is the effect that a governmental measure has on the rights of
the investor. As stated by the tribunal in Tecmed v. Mexico:

[...][M]easures adopted by a State, whether regulatory or not, are an indirect de
facto expropriation if they are irreversible and permanent and if the assets or
rights subject to such measure have been affected in such a way that “...any form
of exploitation thereof...” has disappeared; i.e. the economic value of the use,
enjoyment or disposition of the assets or rights affected by the administrative
action or decision have been neutralized or destroyed.” (R-I { 35.3, citing Tecmed
v. Mexico, emphasis in original).

 

1157.In order to succeed in their allegation that the inspections from October 2008 —
March 2009 amounted to an expropriation, Claimants must demonstrate that the
interference was in fact equivalent to an expropriation. Respondent argues that it
did not interfere with the day-to-day management of KPM and TNG. Rather, the
inspecting agencies made every effort to not disrupt the business of KPM and
TNG, and Claimants have not proven that their day-to-day business was seriously
disrupted, despite requests that they meet this burden of proof. Occasional and
legitimate inspections and audits, clearly, do not prevent investors from directing
the day-to-day operations of the investments, and Claimants have not proven
otherwise. (R-I {ff 35.21 — 35.23; R-II ff 907 - 910).

1158.In addition, at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability, then-General Director of
TNG, Mr. Cojin, stressed that the Financial Police “could not disturb us too often
because we were very busy with production [...].” (RPHB 2 4 23).

1159. It is noteworthy that the Claimants have not complained — and indeed cannot
complain — that the laws in and of themselves were expropriatory. If the laws
themselves are not expropriatory, only there misapplication can be. Hence, a
showing of lawfulness under domestic law will preclude a notion of expropriation.
(R-I ff 35.9 — 35.10, partially quoted).

1160. Finally, other tribunals have formulated further requirements for the State’s right to
regulate, including due process of law and non-discrimination. Respondent also
cites Azurix v. Argentina, where the Tribunal held that no indirect expropriation
had occurred because the impact on the investment due to the State’s measures

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 250 of 415
Page 249 of 414

was, in the aggregate, not attributable for the loss to the claimant, which still had
control over the investment. Likewise, in LG&E v. Argentina, the tribunal found
that there was no expropriation because the investor had not lost control over the
investment. (R-II {{{ 901 — 903).

1161.Finally, the Republic’s alleged reversal of its pre-emptive rights waiver (which
Respondent denies) and its supposedly false announcement of irregularities did not
deprive Claimants of their ability to dispose of their investment. (R-II {| 918).
Respondent lawfully revoked its authorisation of the transfer from Gheso to Terra
Raf. None of the alleged problems with Claimants’ disposal of their assets were
Respondent’s doing. (R-II [ 919; RPHB 2 {[ 272 — 281).

ii. Right to Regulate

1162. Prominent scholars in international law, including Ian Brownlie, Prof. Sornarajah,
and Prof. Bickstiegel also agree that legitimate regulatory actions do not constitute
a compensable expropriation. Extensive practice in international investment
arbitration has also shown that valid state regulation is non-compensable. (R-II {{]
950 — 956).

1163.A determination of whether there has been an indirect expropriation, even in cases
similar to Tecmed, is limited by a state’s police powers. Losses incurred by the
investor which are “incidental to the normal operation of laws of the State” may be
non-compensable. (R-I {[{[ 35.5 — 35.6).

1164. The sovereignty of the state over its natural resources includes the right to regulate,
and this has been confirmed in the Preamble to the 1991 European Energy Charter,
the 1975 Helsinki Declaration, as well as other treaties. The laws of the host state
are highly relevant, and the investor is entitled to compensation only for those
damages, actions, or omissions by state bodies or officials that are contrary to the
host state’s legislation. (R-II {| 922 — 926).

1165.Respondent explains that a regulatory action does not constitute compensable
expropriation. The definition of expropriation as provided in the Convention that
establishes the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, to which 176 states are
party, defines expropriation in general terms, excluding “non-discriminatory
measures of general application which the governments normally take for the
purpose of regulating economic activities in their territories.” (R-I {{[ 927 — 932).

1166.This is confirmed by Art. 1 of the Protocol 1 to the European Convention of
Human Rights (1952), which states that the “enforcement of laws, necessary to
control the use of property in accordance with the general interest cannot
constitute a compensable taking.”

1167.The approach taken by the ECtHR should be of guidance to this Tribunal.
Respondent presents cases under the ECtHR where compulsory alienation of
property, the imposition of a duty, or the withdrawal of a license, tax sanctions for
violations of tax legislation, was found to be non-expropriatory. (R-I {J 933 —
940). The case practice of the ECtHR is relevant here, as that Court hears
investment claims and its cases demonstrate that a deprivation of property in the
form of fines, taxes, etc., does not constitute an expropriation and does not require

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 251 of 415
Page 250 of 414

compensation. States are given a wide margin of discretion in determining the
public interest and the measures required in the pursuance of these interests. The
ECtHR first considers whether the measures were lawful under the laws of the host
state and evaluates whether the law was sufficiently available, specified, and
predictable. The ECtHR emphasizes throughout that its competence for
assessment of the lawfulness of state authorities’ actions is limited. Second, the
ECtHR assesses measures in respect of their proportionality, taking into account
the wrongfulness of the applicant’s conduct, the interests of the host state and the
investor, the requirements of public interests, and the requirements of protection of
fundamental freedoms. (R-II {{[ 940 — 949).

1168.All of the measures at issue concerned the lawful enforcement of laws that are
necessary to regulate the hazardous and strategically important exploration and
extraction of oil and gas. (R-II {{{ 904 — 905). Contrary to Claimants’ assertion,
there was no “campaign of harassment and coercion designed to undermine and
interfere with Claimants’ management and control of KPM and TNG.” Rather, the
measures at issue were legitimate and the state was entitled to regulate. (R-I {{{f
35.15, 35.20; R-II { 906).

iii. Acts Allegedly Amounting to An
Indirect Expropriation

1169. Claimants incredibly and wildly assert that various alleged treaty breaches, slowly
and quickly, individually and/or in combination, breached the ECT. Respondent
explains that Claimants have argued that the following actions individually and
cumulatively amount to an indirect expropriation of Claimants’ rights in KPM and
TNG: (1) the Republic’s refusal to prolong the exploration rights under Contract
302, (2) the assessment of back transfer price taxes and back taxes on corporate
income, (3) the alleged revocation of the purported approval of the transfer of
TNG’s shares to Terra Raf, (4) the dispute about the application of the Crude Oil
Export Tax, (5) the classification of KPM’s and TNG’s pipelines as trunk
pipelines, (6) the ensuing trial and conviction of Mr. Cornegruta and the verdict
against KPM, and (7) the seizure orders against KPM and TNG. (R-I { 35.11).
The assertions have changed so frequently that they are not credible. (RPHB 2 {I
419 — 423).

1170. Respondent also notes that “Claimants have clandestinely dropped all relevant tax
measures from the list of alleged expropriations and only mention them in a
footnote in this section in which they claim that they had been deprived of their
ability to dispose of the investment. Apparently, Claimants have come to the
conclusion that the tax measures cannot constitute an expropriation and quite
rightly so. The taxation measures do not fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.
In any event, the tax measures do not constitute expropriations under Article 13
ECT.” Further as has been demonstrated, the Tax Committee’s assessment of
corporate back taxes was legitimate, the 2008 crude oil export duties were lawful
and were not paid by TNG, and the 2009 duties were withdrawn before either KPM
or TNG made any payment. Respondent further states that “the taxation measures
were not expropriatory because neither was an ‘acquired right’ taken from
Claimants nor could the tax measures be said to ‘frustrate the complete operation
of [Claimants’] activities in [Kazakhstan].”” (R-II [ 920 - 921).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 252 of 415
Page 251 of 414

1171.Respondent’s arguments and points on indirect expropriation are best taken from
its own words:

899. The Republic did not indirectly expropriate Claimants. Even Claimants do
not seem to be certain which measure is supposed to have indirectly
expropriated them when they refer to “expropriatory conduct over the
October 2008-July 2010 period”. They later enumerate four allegedly
expropriatory measures taken by the Republic but remain very elusive as
to whether each of these measures is supposed to have constituted an
expropriation or whether they collectively expropriated Claimants: Firstly,
the Republic allegedly interfered with the day-to-day management of KPM
and TNG when the Financial Police “commandeered” their offices from
October 2008 - March 2009, secondly, the Republic allegedly deprived
Claimants of their ability to manage their companies by arresting KPM’s
General Director in April 2009 and “hunting” other KPM and TNG senior
officials, thirdly, the cumulative effect of Kazakhstan’s alleged harassment
campaign, including the refusal to execute the extension of Contract No.
302 supposedly deprived Claimants of their ability to prove their reserves
and finally, the Republic's alleged reversal of its pre-emptive rights waiver
and its supposedly false announcement of irregularities are said to have
deprived Claimants of their ability to dispose of their investment.

900. Claimants mischaracterise the Republic’s actions in each of the above
cases. Ironically, in the first two cases, the Republic’s actions related to
the need to investigate and later to punish the Claimants own misdeed or
that of KPM and TNG and their employees. In each case, all measures
taken by the Republic were legitimate and a legal applications of Kazakh
law which were not expropriatory in nature. In any event, none of the
measures even came close to the effect of a taking. (R-II {J 899 — 900; see
also R-I {{ 35.11 — 35.12 listing Claimants’ claims).

1172.Claimants operated trunk pipelines without a license, at least since 2002. Mr.
Cornegruta wrote to the MEMR in May 2008 to apply for a trunk pipeline, but the
application was incomplete. The investigation that led to this conclusion
demonstrates clearly that nothing about the criminal charges against Mr.
Cornegruta was premeditated — the relevant agencies (MEMR and the Financial
Police) operated independently of one another and, on 15 December 2008, the
Financial Police opened a criminal investigation based on reasonable suspicions
that KPM was operating a trunk pipeline without a license. This investigation was
based on the following evidence: (1) letters from KPM and TNG to the MEMR
requesting the re-issue of a licence, (2) a letter from KPM to ARNM requesting the
re-issue of a licence, (3) a geological committee report, (4) a letter from ARNM
confirming that KPM and TNG held no licenses for trunk pipelines, (5) an expert
review based on a similar pipeline, and (6) the design documentation for the
pipelines. Witnesses were interviewed and there was a physical examination of the
pipeline. Mr. Rakhimoy of the Financial Police finally obtained an expert opinion
from Mr. Baymaganbetov on 13 February 2009 about whether the pipelines were,
indeed, trunk. Mr. Baymaganbetov reviewed four reports provided to him by the
Financial Police and, although he was free to seek out other opinions, he did not.
Claimants’ four expert opinions were not shown to him because their independence
could not be verified and they risked compromising his independence. Claimants’
reliance on 5 opinions from other governmental agencies fared just as well, since

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 253 of 415
Page 252 of 414

Claimants filed to provide the scope of the request for the issuance of those
opinions, the agencies may have been involved in the design or other aspects of the
pipeline and, most importantly, none of them were appointed in accordance with
Art. 243 CPC. (RPHB 2 {ff 151 — 207).

1173.To repeat from above, the conclusion that the at-issue pipelines were indeed trunk
pipelines is both legally and factually correct. The Parties’ witnesses agreed on the
legal definition of a trunk pipeline, which is provided in the Law on Oil.
Importantly, the Parties have agreed that the relevant section of pipeline extends
beyond the Contract Area, for which KPM never had a license. Claimants’
allegation that they had all of the licenses that they needed can only be true if they
demonstrate that they have only field pipelines — a type of pipeline that cannot go
beyond the Contract Area. Contrary to Prof. Suleymenov’s opinion, the
classification of a pipeline is not a matter of industry analysis or the visual size of
the pipeline. The Parties’ experts agree that it is a question of law. Since “(i) the
KPM Pipeline extends beyond the Contract Area (i.e. it is not a field / contractors
pipeline), (ii) third party oil as well as commercial oil is carried by the pipeline,
(iii) that the oil is commercial, and (iv) that the oil is transported to places of
transshipment, transport, processing or consumption”, the pipeline is a trunk
pipeline. Claimants’ new assertion that the Law on Oil excludes pipelines that are
involved in the single technological process of oil and gas production from the
classification as “main pipelines” is incorrect and is based on a mishearing of Mr.
Romanosov’s testimony. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 219 — 236).

1174. It is to be noted that Claimants always had the duty to obtain a license for operation
of a trunk pipelines before operating one. Claimants knew of the licensing laws
and it would have been easy for them to seek clarification if needed. Their most
recent application was incomplete and Claimants chose not to procure a license.
(RPHB 2 {ff 208 — 218).

1175.Penal measures following the violation of a criminal statute cannot give rise to a
compensatory taking. Mr. Cornegruta was prosecuted and convicted in accordance
with due process and Kazakh law. His conviction cannot constitute an indirect
expropriation, and Claimants have not demonstrated how his absence affected the

ing, and ing” of the i . In this regard, the
Biloune case, cited by Claimants, is easily distinguishable from this matter. There,
the claimant (Biloune, the investor) had a central role in promoting, financing, and
managing the investment, and was expulsed from the host state. Here, however,
Claimants have not even attempted to show to what extent Mr. Cornegruta had a
central role, or how his absence made it impossible to pursue KPM’s investment
activity. Claimants have only made the less forceful assertion, that he was only an
employee. This case is, thus, clearly distinguishable from Biloune. Respondent
rejects Claimants’ assertion that it was “hunting” KPM and TNG senior officials.
(R-I {35.17 — 35.18; R-II {f 911 — 913).

 

1176. Kazakh law uncontestedly provides for the recovery of income obtained by means
of illegal activity. Such recovery is necessary to address unjust enrichment
obtained by criminal means. As KPM earned income from its general manager’s
criminal behaviour, namely the illegal operation of a main pipeline without a
license, it was the natural consequence that the court ordered the recovery of this
income. Kazakh law foresees recovery of illegal income from a company, even

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 254 of 415

1177.

1178.

1179.

1180.

Page 253 of 414

where the company is not named as a party in the criminal case, and there is no
requirement that the Republic bring a civil claim in order to recover this unlawful
income. The amount of illegal income received in the course of illegal
entrepreneurial activity is unjust enrichment. (RPHB 2 {{] 243 — 261).

Claimants’ criticism that the recovery was disproportionate misses the mark: the
goal is to address and negate the unjust enrichment that results from the crime, not
to punish the crime. The unjust enrichment is not limited to the hypothetical
income for providing crude oil transportation services. Squire Sanders assessed the
amount subject to recover to be reasonably over USD 80,000,000. (RPHB 2 {if
262 — 264).

In response to cases cited by Claimants, Respondent states as follows:

914. In Benvenuti & Bonfant v. Congo the Tribunal held that the investor had
been expropriated because the army had seized the premises of a bottling
factory. The only relevance of the fact that the manager had fled the
country due to the risk of criminal proceedings was that this was one of the
arguments to refute Congo's allegation that the investor could return
anytime to take repossession of his property.

915. Likewise, the facts in Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. Tanzania bear no
resemblance to the case at hand. In this case, the investor’s senior
management was forcibly deported from Tanzania while simultaneously
the premises of the investor were seized. This does not compare to the
lawful prosecution and conviction of Mr. Cornegruta. (R-II {J 914 — 915).

In response to Claimants’ allegation that they were deprived of the ability to prove
reserves, Respondent states as follows:

916. The cumulative effect of Kazakhstan's alleged harassment campaign,
including the refusal to execute the extension of Contract No. 302 did not
deprive Claimants of the ability to prove reserves.

 

917. The Republic has d d that no such harass ipaign existed.
The non-extension of Contract 302 cannot constitute an indirect
expropriation. It is telling that Claimants’ consider the non-extension to
be both a direct and an indirect expropriation when in fact it does not
constitute a taking at all. Contract 302 expired on 30 March 2009. Vain
hope to prolong a contract cannot constitute a taking and as demonstrated
above, Claimants did not obtain a right to prolong the contract. (R-II 1
916-917).

The 9 April 2009 letter did not oblige the MEMR to enter into an addendum for
Contract 302. In any event, TNG’s successful application for a renewal of its
license would have been a pre-requisite to such an extension. The subsoil use
contract and the license for subsoil use are different documents with different
natures. The fact that the MEMR is both the Competent Authority and the
Licensing Authority did not abolish the need to amend existing licenses, nor did it
change the procedure for such amendments. Mr. Suleymenov’s last minute expert
submission provides no support for Claimants’ unfounded allegation that the
MEMR agreed to extend Contract 302 and to execute an extension. As explained

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 255 of 415

1181.

1182.

1183.

1184.

Page 254 of 414

by Prof. Ilyassova, the decision of the Expert Commission to recommend extension
is part of the Competent Authority’s internal process and cannot be equated with a
decision to actually extend, nor can the letter of 9 April 2009, since it was not
ordered by the Minister. (RPHB 2 {[{[ 292 — 305).

In addition, Claimants would not have been able to prove reserves, as they allege.
Even if the Contract 302 had been extended, TNG would have been bound by the
working program of 14 October 2008 and the draft addendum of 30 April 2009,
which only contained exploratory work on Munaibay and Bahyt. Neither
contained a reference to the Interoil Reef. Claimants’ allegation that TNG would
not have been bound by these working programmes is contrary to the testimony of
their own witnesses and their opening statement. These were not “minimum”
working programs, but were working programs. Addendum 5 to contract 302, Art.
3.3 does not contain the word “minimum” — the relevant Law on Oil and the
Subsoil Law in force from October 2008 to March 2011 and the terms of Contract
302 would have required changes to the work programme if the subsoil user
intended to go beyond the agreed working program. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 319 — 328).

The non-extension of Contract 302 made no interference with Claimants’ ability to
use and dispose of their investments. The subsoil belongs to the State and, as of 30
March 2009, Claimants lost all right to that area because they failed to declare a
commercial discovery. (RPHB 2 {[{[ 329 — 330).

The tribunal in LG&E respected the State’s power to adopt measures having social
or general welfare purposes. That tribunal stated that, such a measure must be
accepted without the imposition of liability, except where such a measure was
obviously disproportionate. The tribunal in Tecmed considered the issue of
proportionality:

[T]he Arbitral Tribunal will consider, in order to determine if they are to be
characterized as expropriatory, whether such actions or measures are
proportional to the public interest presumably protected thereby and to the
protection legally granted to investments, taking into account that the significance
of such impact has a key role upon deciding the proportionality. Although the
analysis starts at the due deference owing to the State when defining the issues that
affect its public policy or the interests of society as a whole, as well as the actions
that will be implemented to protect such values, such situation does not prevent the
Arbitral Tribunal, without thereby questioning such due deference, from examining
the actions of the State in light of [the expropriation provision of the BIT] to
determine whether such measures are reasonable with respect to their goals, the
deprivation of economic rights and the legitimate expectations of who suffered
such deprivation. There must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality
between the charge or weight imposed to the foreign investor and the aim sought
to be realized by any expropriatory measure. (R-I ff 35.7 — 35.8, partially quoted,
emphasis maintained).

Respondent reminds the Tribunal that KPM and TNG repeatedly broke Kazakh law
by making incorrect tax assessments and operating a trunk pipeline without a
license. The audit requests were reasonable given the strong suspicions of
wrongdoing. Respondent states that it was Claimants’ own fault that the
authorities started investigations. (R-I { 35.14).

d. _ Direct Expropriation
i. Transfer of Title

1185.A direct expropriation requires a transfer of title. Here, Claimants have conceded
that no transfer of title took place. Since there was no transfer of title, no direct
expropriation occurred. (R-I {{f[ 34.2 — 34.3; R-II {J 879 — 881, 888 — 890).

1186.Respondent at no point in time expropriated Claimants’ assets. Given the
numerous violations of the Subsoil Use Contracts, Respondent had no choice but to
terminate the contracts and to transfer the contractual territory of KPM and TNG
into trust management. Proceeds from the operation of the fields are held in an
escrow account. (RPHB 2 {{f 415 — 417).

1187.Respondent explains how the transfer of KPM and TNG to state custody did not
constitute a transfer of title and, therefore, was not an expropriation:

34.5 [...] Upon termination of the Subsoil Use Contracts, the ownership rights
of KPM and TNG automatically ceased to exist. Under Article 72(10) of
the Subsoil Law (Exhibit R-152) and due to the circumstances set out in
detail above, the assets then had to be transferred to KMG so that they
would be taken into trust management.

34.6 As explained above, and unlike in certain common law national
jurisdictions, this does not entail any transfer of the title of the assets,
although, under the provisions of the law, the trust manager is entitled to
possess and use the facilities and equipment. This arrangement is set up so
as to enable continuing production.

34.7 Therefore, there is no transfer of title envisaged under article 72(10) of the
Subsoil Law. Moreover, the subsoil user has the opportunity to have its
contract reinstate. Where this is not possible or desired, the contract can
be transferred to a new subsoil user with the assets. At this point, the
payment of the subsoil users’ costs and its property must be provided for in
the new agreement.

34.8 This does not amount to an expropriation. Rather, an inherent limitation in
the rights held by KPM and TNG came to bear. Moreover, there are
opportunities for compensation within provided for within the mechanism.
(R-I YY 34.5 — 34.8).

1188.Respondent presents that Claimants have mis-cited Telnor v. Hungary, which
considered not a direct expropriation, but a creeping expropriation. Likewise,
Claimants’ citation of Metalclad is also misleading, as that tribunal did not
differentiate between direct and indirect expropriation. Instead, the tribunal in
Metalclad enumerated several actions that could amount to an expropriation —
direct and indirect. It, therefore, cannot be relied upon to identify the requirements
for a direct expropriation.

1189.Respondent argues that Tecmed concerns indirect de facto expropriation and
accuses Claimants of inserting the quote “direct expropriation” in brackets

throughout their quotation of that text, and states that they, instead, should have
inserted the phrase “indirect expropriation” to correctly quote the tribunal in that
case. (R-II {{{[ 882 — 887). Finally, the Santa Elena tribunal merely explained the
general principles of expropriation and — without differentiating between direct and
indirect expropriation — affirmed that in some cases (indirect expropriation cases),
expropriation can occur without a formal transfer of title. (R-I J 34.4).

With respect to the LPG Plant, it is even more obvious that there was no
expropriation since TNG still owns the plant and the plant was not transferred into
trust management. (RPHB 2 {| 418).

ii. Exercise of Regulatory Power

International law recognizes that, even in cases involving a transfer of title, there is
not always an “expropriation.” States, in an exercise of their sovereignty, can take
measures without being obliged to compensate investors, as explained by the S.D.
Myers tribunal. Expropriatory acts must be differentiated from valid governmental
activity. Here, the termination of the Subsoil Use Contracts, the non-extension of
Contract 302, and the transfer to trust management of KPM’s and TNG’s assets
were dictated by and consistent with Kazakh law and, thus, were a legitimate
exertion of the Republic’s regulatory power. (R-I {ff 34.10 — 34.13; R-II {J 891 —
892). The assets have been protected and the monies held in escrow, where they
will remain until a new subsoil user is found. (RPHB 2 {{ 373).

First, the non-extension of Contract 302 cannot constitute an expropriation, as it
did not take anything from the investor. Second, the termination of the Subsoil Use
Contracts cannot be a direct expropriation, as it was mandated by Kazakh law. The
same is true for the transfer of the contractual territory into trust management — an
action that was a legal consequence of KPM’s and TNG’s misconduct. (R-II {if
893 — 895; RPHB 2 {| 329 — 330).

Claimants explain that an action that is legal under local law cannot constitute a
treaty breach unless that law itself breaches the treaty. Claimants have not argued
otherwise and, thus, concede that the relevant Kazakh laws are in accordance with
international law. This is true, despite Claimants’ arguments that the Republic
cannot rely on domestic law to legalize the taking because the Republic must still
provide compensation. As explained, neither the Republic nor any other state
entity ever owned the contractual territories. Any compensation will be in the
contract entered into with the new subsoil user that would compensate KPM and
TNG. (R-II {Jf 896 — 897).

Finally, Respondent states that any claim for expropriation must fail, because
Claimants’ own actions and external events were relevant in the demise of the
companies. (R-II { 898).

Claimants were in continuing and serious breach of Contracts 210 and 305 as a
result of their operation of a trunk pipeline without a license, their breaches of tax
laws, their failure to comply with KPM’s and TNG’s minimum working programs,
among others. Claimants have not disputed that KPM and TNG were in violation
of labor laws in early 2010. In addition, Claimants’ treatment of the fields can
accurately be described as “barbaric.” The actual work promised under the

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 258 of 415
Page 257 of 414

working programs — like the drilling of wells - was not carried out, despite alleged
financial investment in KPM and TNG (investment which, nevertheless, was
insufficient from 2007 — 2009). Claimants’ arguments that KPM and TNG were
given “a clean bill of health” are without merit. Minister Mynbayev’s testimony
expressly confirmed that prior to the June 2010 inspections, Claimants were in
breach. He also stated that, by July 2010, the situation was no longer tolerable.
(RPHB 2 {ff 339 — 349).

1196. The Republic, due to the breaches of environmental law, reports of Claimants’
failure to pay salaries and reports of mass employee dismissals, and the poor
conditions in the field, was obliged if not entitled to carry out inspections of KPM
and TNG in June and July 2010. These inspections revealed additional serious
violations of Contracts 210 and 305 by KPM and TNG. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 350 — 352).

1197.The severity of the breaches of Contracts 210 and 305 left the Republic with no
option but to act and serve notices of breach. Although they had previously been
given opportunities to cure, their responses to the 14 July 2010 notice for breach on
19 July 2010 was inadequate and focused only on procedural reasons to challenge
termination. For example, Claimants claimed “force majeur” for their failure to
make payments related to KPM and TNG’s historical costs, KPM’s contributions
to the Kazakh liquidation fund, and KPM’s tax obligations due to the fact that
KPM’s accounts were frozen as a result of the execution of the recovery order for
the operation of a pipeline without a license. The execution orders were not force
majeur and, allegedly, they did not (as Claimants state) prevent Claimants from
paying employees. Importantly — Squire Sanders also raised the issue of payment
of historical costs by KPM and TNG, as well as other failures to meet obligations
regarding the acquisition of goods, works, and services, in its June 2009 report.
(RPHB 2 {ff 353 — 358).

1198.In addition, Claimants neglected and mistreated the investment, having effectively
abandoned it. There were reports of salaries not being paid, complaints about
KPM and TNG’s treatment of the fields, and reports that production had stopped.
Claimants provide not support for their argument that these were “post hoc”
justification for termination. There were quite clearly social problems and issues
that were being experienced in June and July 2010, due to KPM and TNG’s failure
to pay wages. Claimants have misquoted Mr. Ongarbaev that there was no risk of
unemployment, since employees would just be re-hired under trust management.
Claimants quote GCA for support of the statement that the fields were in good
condition, but this is inaccurate — GCA only referred to the facilities being
“adequate for the region.” (RPHB 2 {ff 359 — 366).

1199. The Republic terminated Contracts 210 and 305 in accordance with the law. The
Republic fully complied with Section 38 of the Law of Private Business when
conducting inspections and Claimants always had the right to appeal the
inspections reports. They failed to appeal within the permitted three days.
Claimants’ attempts to contest the very different Notices of Breach served under
Subsoil Law 2010 cannot be said to be an appeal of the Acts of Inspection pursuant
to the Law of Private Business. In any event, contrary to Claimants’ position, a
breach of the Law of Private Business would not result in a breach of Art. 72 of the
Subsoil Law 2010, pursuant to which the Contracts were terminated. The two laws
are different and there were grounds for termination arising from the monitoring of

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 259 of 415
Page 258 of 414

KPM and TNG as well as for the inspections in June and July 2010. (RPHB 2 {{{[
367 — 368).

1200.Claimants’ arguments, based on Mr. Suleymenov’s testimony that there was a
conspiracy behind the timing of the termination and the date the Subsoil Law 2010
was passed have not been proven. The law was heavily debated and took almost
two years to pass. Mr. Suleymenov’s opinion is irrelevant in this arbitration.
(RPHB 2 {[ 369).

1201.Claimants were given enough time to respond to the Notices of Breach and were

aware of the many breaches set out therein. They participated in the July 2010

audit and were regularly involved in findings. The limited period for response was

also justified by the t hes of monetary obligati and the requi to
provide information. Since production had nearly stopped, there was little chance
of employees being paid, as senior managers left the country. Delay was not an
option for the Republic. Claimants, however, made no attempt to seek an
extension to the deadline and responded — insufficiently — within the period.
(RPHB 2 {{{[ 371 — 372).

 

3. The Tribunal

1202. It is the Tribunal’s task to decide on the relief sought by Claimants, as recorded
above in a separate chapter of this Award:

. A declaration that Kazakhstan has violated the ECT and international law
with respect to Claimants’ investments;

. Compensation to Claimants for all damages they have suffered, as set forth
in Claimants’ Statement of Claim and Reply on Quantum and as further
updated at the January 2013 Hearing and in Claimants’ First Post-
Hearing Brief, corresponding to the following amounts:

1203. Regarding the first relief sought and repeated above, a declaration that Respondent
has violated the ECT is possible already after a breach of the FET obligation has
been found by the Tribunal.

1204. Regarding the second relief sought repeated above, if such damages are granted on
the basis of one particular ECT provision, there is no need for the Tribunal to
examine further whether the same relief would also have to be granted on the basis
of another ECT provision.

1205. Since, in a previous chapter of this Award, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion
that Respondent is liable for breach of the FET standard in Art. 10(1), it only needs
to examine a possible further breach of Art. 13 by expropriation, if there are any
further damages sought by Claimants not covered by the FET breach.

1206. As will be seen later in the chapters of this Award on Causation and Quantum, the
FET breach has caused a taking of Claimants’ investment, resulting in respective
damages.

1211.

Page 259 of 414

In view of this, there is no need to examine whether the same results also from a
breach of Art. 13 ECT.

However, as will be seen and addressed in the chapter of this Award on Quantum,
Art. 13 ECT provides some guidance regarding the calculation of damages.

J... Respondent’s Provision of Domestic Legal
Remedies (Art. 10(12) ECT)

1. Arguments by Claimants

Article 10(12) ECT obliges each Contracting Party to “ensure that its domestic law
provides effective means for the assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights
with respect to Ii i agreements, and i
authorizations.” This obligation is distinct from customary international law, and
is distinct but similar to the concept of denial of justice. Article 10(12) ECT was
designed “to prevent the travesties of justice that occurred in this case, by ensuring
that an investor has an effective means to enforce its legal rights. Claimants had
no ability to enforce their legal rights, and Kazakhstan is indisputably liable under
the ECT for denying them the ability to do so.” (C-I {¥ 373 — 374, 379, partially
quoted).

The Tribunal in the Chevron v. Ecuador case stated that “a failure of domestic
courts to enforce rights ‘effectively’ will constitute a violation” of the guarantee to
provide effective means to assert claims and enforce rights. (C-I {{{ 373 — 374; C-
IL (548, partially quoted)

The tribunal in Chevron also interpreted the “effective means” obligation as
allowing the tribunal to examine the state’s conduct, in addition to the system of
laws and institutions in place. Claimants state that, in this way, the Tribunal is
obliged to reassess the criminal case against Mr. Cornegruta. (C-I {| 375 — 376).
Claimants explain as follows:

377. In the present case, the Tribunal need not assess the criminal case against
Mr. Cornegruta and KPM de novo to determine that the Kazakh court
issued decisions against Claimants that a “fair and impartial” Kazakh
judge would never have reached. A fair and impartial judge would not
have convicted KPM, which was not even named as a party in the criminal
proceeding and could not have been, since criminal charges may not be
brought against a company under Kazakh law. It would not have
convicted KPM and Mr. Cornegruta when KPM had never operated a
“main” pipeline, as acknowledged by the State itself in MEMR reports,
and when Mr. Cornegruta was not an “entrepreneur” under Kazakh law
but merely an employee of KPM. Additionally, a fair and impartial judge
would have considered all the evidence before it. The Kazakh judge
disregarded multiple expert reports from Claimants and based his decision
solely on an unfounded and conclusory opinion from a Ministry of Justice
employee.

378. Further, a fair and impartial judge would have given KPM the opportunity
to defend itself. It would not have confirmed the convictions on appeal and

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 261 of 415
Page 260 of 414

effectively prevented KPM from exercising its right to appeal. (C-I {f 377
- 378).

551. Finally, Kazakhstan’s assertion that “it was legally correct and not to
KPM'’s disadvantage that it was not a party to the [criminal] proceedings”
is breathtaking. Claimants do not deny that “a measure of deference” is to
be “afforded to the domestic justice system.” However, Kazakhstan has
far exceeded whatever “measure of deference” may exist under
international law, as evidenced, inter alia, by its attempts to justify the
findings of its courts ex post facto in the present arbitration. [...]. (C-IL]
551).

1212.Kazakhstan’s misconduct makes it liable to Claimants under the ECT and
international law as Respondent has violated nearly every protection afforded
foreign investors under the ECT and international law. (C-I {{] 380 — 383).

1213.Claimants state that Respondent is mistaken in its contention that Claimants cannot
invoke Art. 10(12) ECT with regard to the Subsoil Use Contracts because they
largely did not turn to courts or contractually agreed arbitral tribunals. First, a
foreign investor faced with a plethora of wrongful measures by a host state has the
right to choose the forum with the more comprehensive jurisdiction. Using the
umbrella clause, international arbitration under the ECT is the appropriate choice
since it covers both disputes relating to investments and contractual claims.
Moreover, the forum selection clauses in the Subsoil Use Contracts refer to the
Arbitration Institute of the SCC. Second, Claimants have made a bona fide attempt
to resolve their dispute before Kazakh courts, and this has been acknowledged by
Respondent. As to appeals, Claimants were either denied the possibility of appeal
or were precluded from pursuing their pending law suits, at the latest by the July
2010 seizure of their investments. Thus, Claimants utilized the means made
available to them. (C-II {| 548 — 550).

1214. At the Hearing on Liability, Mr. Condorachi explained Claimants’ attempts to
complain about the investigation, prosecution, and conviction of Mr. Cornegruta
and KPM. Respondent’s witnesses also confirmed that there were at least 8
complaints from KPM and TNG, and one more from Terra Raf and Ascom.
Respondent’s argument that KPM could have appealed, but failed to, is
disingenuous since KPM was not a party and, therefore, could not appeal and,
second, the Aktau City Court refused to provide KPM a certified copy of the
judgment to enable them to appeal. The evidence even shows that KPM
challenged the court’s refusal to send KPM this copy. (CPHB | {{{[ 205 — 210).
Kazakhstan’s conduct in relation to the trial and the appeal violate its obligations
under the ECT to provide effective means to assert claims and enforce rights.
(CPHB 2 {if 97 — 114).

1215.During the hearing, the judge refused to entertain Mr. Cornegruta’s defense
counsel’s motion for a postponement in order to examine Mr. Baymaganbetov’s
evidence. The trial transcripts also establish that the Financial Police were
involved in the prosecution and influenced the trial process. (CPHB 1 {{{[ 201 —
204).

The text of Art. 10(12) ECT unambiguously establishes a legislative obligation to
provide a fair and efficient system of justice, and does not encompass isolated
failures of the judicial system in individual cases. (R-II J] 1108 — 1114, partially
quoted).

The availability of remedies hinders any claim if these remedies have not been
pursued. Claimants, therefore, cannot bring a claim under Art. 10(12) ECT
because they have failed to pursue remedies or exhaust appeals. As confirmed by
other investment tribunals, the duty to exhaust remedies needs to be interpreted
more strictly because of its specific meaning, which creates a legislative obligation
to provide a fair and efficient system of justice. A high likelihood of success of
these remedies is not required in order to expect a claimant to attempt them. (R-I
ql 43.2 — 43.4, R-II {Jf 1125 — 1129, partially quoted; RPHB 2).

Claimants conceded that they have not exhausted all remedies or appeals made
available to them by Kazakh law. They have offered no evidence that pursuing
such would have been ineffective or futile. With respect to their contract claims,
they have not explained why they did not resort to the international arbitration
proceedings as required in the Subsoil Use Contracts and in Contract 302.
Contrary to their allegation, they did not have the right to choose the forum with
the more comprehensive jurisdiction. The contract between the investor and the
host state is the /ex specialis, compared with the treaty between the two host states.
Foreign investors must comply with exclusive forum selection clauses before they
may rely on investment treaty guarantees. (R-I {ff 40.1 — 40.4; R-II { 1130 —
1134; RPHB 2 {{[ 374).

Claimants did not appeal the Acts of Inspection of 15 July within the 3 days
allowed as they could have under the Law of Private Business 2009. They, thus,
have no basis to allege that they were denied the right to appeal the inspection
reports. Claimants’ contesting of the Notices of Breach served under the Subsoil
Law 2010 are not appeals of the very different Acts of Inspection. In any event,
Claimants were given enough time to respond to the Notices of Breach, and in any
event, such allegations had been raised before. Claimants made no attempt to see
an extension of either deadline. (RPHB 2 {If 368 — 372).

Turning to Claimants’ Chevron arguments, Respondent states that Claimants base
their contention that Chevron is even applicable in this case on the allegation that
case involved a similarly worded provision. Respondent compares these texts as
follows (R-II {¥ 1110 — 1112, partially quoted, emphasis maintained):

1111. The relevant provision in the BIT between the USA and Ecuador, Article
Il(7), reads:

Each Party shall provide effective means of asserting claims and
enforcing rights with respect to investment, investment agreements, and
investment authorizations. (emphasis added)

1112. Incontrast, Article 10(12) of the ECT stipulates explicitly:

Each Contracting Party shall ensure that its domestic law provides
effective means for the assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 263 of 415
Page 262 of 414

with respect to Investments, investment agreements, and investment
authorizations.

1221.That these provisions involve different requirements was confirmed by the Amto v.
Ukraine tribunal, which clarified that the prerequisites of Art. 10(12) ECT are
fulfilled if the foreign investor contends and proves legislative failures by the host
state to provide a fair and efficient system of justice. (R-II { 1115). This meaning
of Art. 10(12) ECT is in accordance with the decision of the Chevron tribunal.
Further still, even where tribunals have applied Chevron and considered Article
II(7) of the BIT between the USA and Ecuador, tribunals have paid special
attention to the legislative failures of a host state to provide a fair and efficient
system of justice. (R-II {{[ 1116-1118).

1222.Claimants have neither contended nor proven that there was a legislative failure to
provide a fair and efficient justice system, which is Claimants’ responsibility under
the onus probandi rule. With respect to the prerequisites carved out by the tribunal
in Amto v. Ukraine, Claimants are required to contend and prove in particular that
there was no legislation for the recognition and enforcement of property and
contractual rights or that this legislation was not made in accordance with the
constitution or was not publicly available or that there were no secondary rules of
procedure so that the principles and objectives of the legislation could not be
translated by Claimants into effective action in the domestic tribunals. (R-II {]
1119).

1223.Indeed, even if Art. 10(12) ECT extended to individual failures of the judicial
system, Claimants would be required to prove procedural irregularity and
interference, which they have not. With respect to the criminal proceedings against
Mr. Cornegruta on behalf of KPM, Claimants’ objection is that the proceedings
were wrong in law. The Tribunal, however, is not a court of appeal for decisions
of Kazakh courts. (R-II ff 1119 — 1123, 1135).

1135. A tribunal’s review of the host State’s legislation is limited. This follows a
fortiori from the fact, that even in cases which do not involve Article
10(12) of the ECT tribunals have concluded that their review of the
decisions by local courts is limited. In Chevron v. Ecuador, for example,
the tribunal stated that a measure of deference needs to be afforded to the
domestic justice system and that the tribunal was not empowered to act as
a court of appeal reviewing every alleged failure of the local judicial
system de novo. (R-II J 1135).

1224. Claimants’ argument that the Chevron decision allows the Tribunal to step into the
shoes of the domestic courts and decide the merits of the case as would a fair and
impartial judge relies on a statement that has been taken out of context. The
Chevron tribunal did not assume the position of a host state judge in finding
whether the assertion of claims clause had been breached. This Tribunal is not an
appellate court. (R-I {J 40.6 — 40.7, 43.6 — 43.7).

1225.A tribunal’s finding of a violation of 10(12) ECT is rare. The only published case
in that respect is Petrobart v. The Kyrgyz Republic, which in any event is not
convincing, since the Tribunal provided no reasons for its disregard of the express
reference to domestic law in Art. 10(12) ECT. That case also involved a high
degree of interference, which has not been alleged here. Cases where violations of

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 264 of 415
Page 263 of 414

similar provisions have been found related to undue delays. In Chevron, there was
an “undue delay of judicial proceedings” because Chevron’s cases had been
pending for 13 — 15 years. In White Industries v. India, a delay in jurisdictional
proceedings of nine years and the Supreme Court’s inability to hear a jurisdictional
appeal for over five years amounted to undue delay. (R-II {{ 1136 — 1141).

1226.Here, Claimants have neither contended nor proven that the criminal proceedings
against Mr. Cornegruta on behalf of KPM suffered from undue delay. None of
Claimants’ allegations about the trial in any way being unfair or impartial is true —
and the fact that the decision came out against Claimants does not automatically
mean that they were unfair. While Respondent admits that certain evidence was
excluded from trial, this was due to a number of reasons including the lack of
attendance of witnesses at trial and non-compliance with procedures for appointing
witnesses. None of the expert reports complied with Art. 243 CPC, which requires
that experts be drawn from a limited pool of expertise. Claimants provided no
evidence of KPM and TNG’s requests for these opinions, making it impossible to
divine the scope of their requests, and there was no guarantee that any of the bodies
issuing opinions — some of which were involved in the design and construction of
the pipelines — were independent from Claimants. (R-I {[ 28; R-II {J 1140 — 1144;
RPHB 2 {{{[ 203 — 207).

1227.At the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability, Prof. Olcott demonstrated that the
principles of justice in the Kazakh legal system are in place and are complied with
sufficiently to prevent violations of due process. Prof. Olcott — who demonstrated
her credibility by also criticizing some aspects of the Kazakh legal system —
explained the training that judges receive as well as the transparency of decisions.
That the Kazakh legal system complies with the legal principle of due process is
also confirmed by the Global Integrity 2008 report. Although Claimants allege that
the Kazakh judiciary does not meet Western standards, the Republic has the
elementary principles of justice in place to prevent violations of due process.
(RPHB 1 {486 — 495).

1228. Also at that Hearing, Claimants made the flawed contention that the trial against
Mr. Cornegruta amounted to a denial of justice. While Respondent concedes that it
is acknowledged that the FET standard includes the obligation not to deny justice
in criminal proceedings, such a claim “requires a manifest and gross failure to
comply with the elementary principles of justice” that “offend[s] a sense of judicial
propriety.” Tribunals such as Loewen v. U.S. and Thunderbird v. Mexico confirm
that his is a very high threshold, in absolute and in relative terms. For criminal
proceedings, as elaborated in Tokios Tokelés v Ukraine, “the sense of judicial
propriety must be shocked by a manifest and gross failure to comply with
elementary principles of justice.” While this stands in stark contrast to the
sophisticated legal framework in the Western world, this minimum standard has
not been breached in the present case. With respect to the witnesses that “were
struck off’, Art. 311 CPC requires a witness to attend trial and to be examined in
order that their evidence is accepted. None of the reports submitted complied with
Kazakh law. Regarding the complaint that the criminal fine was assessed against
KPM, this is consistent with Kazakh law and general principles of procedural
fairness. KPM was always represented during the trial and had every opportunity
to appeal. Regarding Claimants’ allegation that the amount recovered was
disproportionate to KPM’s profits, this is not relevant in the denial of justice

analysis, which requires a manifest and gross violation of the elementary principles
of justice. Finally, with respect to Claimants’ contradictory complaint about the
enforcement of the criminal fine, enforcement is a characteristic feature of the
elementary principles of justice, not a failure to comply with those principles.
(RPHB 1 {{{[ 256 — 260; 496 — 520).

Claimants could have appealed the 18 September 2009 decision against Mr.
Cornegruta to the Supreme Court in Kazakhstan, but chose not to. KPM did not
challenge the decision to not provide a copy of the hearing transcript or decision to
KPM and its failure to appeal the decision — a decision that it always had access to
—is not the fault of Respondent. (RPHB 2 [| 265 — 271).

3. The Tribunal

As explained above in the chapter on expropriation of this Award, it is the
Tribunal’s task to decide on the relief sought by Claimants as recorded above in
this Award. If such relief is granted on the basis of one particular ECT provision,
there is no need for the Tribunal to examine further whether the same relief would
also have to be granted on the basis of another ECT provision.

Since, in a previous chapter of this Award, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion
that Respondent is liable for breach of the FET standard in Art. 10(1), it only needs
to examine a possible further breach of Art. 10(12) ECT, if there is any other relief
sought by Claimants not covered by the FET breach.

Claimants’ allegation of a breach of Art. 10(12) leads to no further relief sought
than that resulting from the FET breach.

J.IV. Whether Kazakhstan Provided the Most
Constant Protection and Security to Claimants’
Investments (Art. 10(1))

1. Arguments by Claimants

The ECT offers a more robust level of protection than most BITs and Claimants’
investment is entitled to such protection:

318. Article 10(1) of the ECT provides that investments “shall enjoy the most
constant protection and security.” This provision is similar to — but
notably stronger than - the more commonly-used language in investment
treaties that obligates host States to provide “full protection and security”
to investments. [...]. (C-I J 318).

Earlier cases, like AAPL v. Sri Lanka, stated that the only “due diligence” required
to be undertaken by the host state in order to provide “most constant protection and
security” was to have reasonable measures of prevention in place. This was
confirmed in AMT v. Zaire, which added that the host state, Zaire, also needed to
comply with its own national laws. These cases have since been expanded upon,
such as in the case CME v. Czech Republic, which expanded the definition so as to
include full protection of licensing rights, among others. (C-I {{f[ 320 — 325).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 266 of 415
Page 265 of 414

1235.Claimants state that, while the “most constant protection and security” standard
was at one time invoked for failure to provide physical protection to an investment,
the standard today clearly encompasses legal security. This has been demonstrated
by consideration of the standard by several investment treaty tribunals, including
Biwarter Gauff v. Tanzania, Siemens v. Argentina, Vivendi II, and National Grid v.
Argentina. These tribunals found that the standard was wider than mere physical
protection — especially in cases involving intangible assets. (C-I {{] 319, 326 - 328;
C-II {{[ 482 - 484).

1236.In addition to failing to provide legal security, Respondent failed to provide
physical security, as demonstrated by “Kazakhstan’s callous arrest of Mr.
Cornegruta, its attempts to arrest the other senior in-country managers of KPM
and TNG, and its harassment of company staff during its investigations[,] [which]
clearly undermined the physical security of Claimants’ investments and rendered
them an unsafe place to work. Kazakhstan's outright physical seizure of KPM and
TNG in July 2010 amounts to a breach of its duty to provide both physical and
legal protection and security.” (C-IL { 485).

1237. Respondent cites no authority for its proposition that including “egal security” in
“most constant protection and security” would make the standard identical to FET.
Other tribunals have recognized the obligations to be separate. In any event, the
fact that two protections rely on the same facts does not obviate the need for the
Tribunal to consider each protection. (C-II { 486).

1238.Claimants contend that Respondent has conflated the “most constant protection
and security” standard with the obligation to provide effective means to assert
claims and enforce rights under Art. 10(12) ECT. In making this argument,
Respondent overlooks that it was the instigator and perpetrator of the violations.
(C-II { 488).

489. Kazakhstan cites three cases to support its argument that the obligation to
ensure the most constant protection and security is one of mere diligence
or vigilance of the host State. However, the issue arose in those three
cases because the respective tribunals needed to determine whether the
acts in question were attributable to the host state and whether the state
could have protected claimants. In the present case, Kazakhstan does not
— and cannot — dispute that the misconduct complained of was
perpetrated by Kazakhstan. There is no issue of state attribution in this
case. As the Tribunal in Wena v. Egypt concluded, where the host State is
itself the instigator or a participant in the violations, there is “no
question” that the obligation was breached. As it is Kazakhstan itself that
instigated and carried out the breach of the ECT’s most constant
protection and security standard, it is not relevant that the standard might
also import a due diligence standard in respect of the conduct of others.
(C-II J 489).

1239.Claimants provide examples of Respondent’s deliberate conduct and argue that
Respondent’s failures to respond to Claimants’ requests for assistance make these
violations even more severe. (C-I {{] 332 — 333):

. On January 19, 2009, Claimants filed complaints with the Western
Regional Transport Prosecutor, the General Prosecutor’s Office, the

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 267 of 415
Page 266 of 414

Ministry of Justice, and the MEMR against the Financial Police in respect
to its illegal actions and to obtain the dismissal of the criminal case
against KPM. The only answer Claimants received was a notice from the
Financial Police that their complaints were dismissed and that a criminal
case also being initiated against TNG.

. On March 18, 2009, Claimants submitted a new complaint with the
General Prosecutor's Office regarding the illegal initiation of criminal
cases against KPM and TNG. Claimants never received an answer to this
complaint.

. In the period from October 2008-March 2009, Claimants wrote to the
MEMR to obtain the extension of the exploration period for Contract No.
302 prior to its expiration on March 30, 2009. The extension was never
granted, in violation of the Government's commitments.

. As per the request of the MEMR, on April 30, 2009, Claimants submitted
addendum No. 9 to Contract No. 302 for the extension of the exploration
period for execution by the MEMR. Claimants never received an answer
to this request for an extension.

. On March 24 and 25, 2009, Claimants requested that Kazakhstan confirm
that Terra Raf was the legitimate owner of TNG and confirm its prior
waiver of its pre-emptive rights. Claimants never received an answer to
this request.

. On April 26-27, 2009, Claimants filed complaints with the Regional
Prosecutor’s Office and the Western Regional Transport Prosecutor
regarding the arrest of Mr. Cornegruta. Claimants never received an
answer to their complaints.

. On May 7, 2009, Claimants appealed directly to President Nazarbayev to
obtain the release of Mr. Cornegruta, protect the former and current
management of KPM and TNG, and end the dispute. President
Nazarbayev ignored the request and never responded.

. After Mr. Cornegruta was sentenced to four years in prison, his wife and
Claimants obtained an undertaking from Moldova to request the transfer
of Mr. Cornegruta to serve his sentence in his home country, closer to his
family. However, the Kazakh Prosecutor General, at the request of the
Financial Police, always requested further assurances from Moldova that
he would indeed serve his sentence. In the end, Kazakhstan refused to
extradite him.

. Kazakhstan improperly assessed alleged corporate back taxes and
penalties against KPM and TNG in the amount of approximately USD 62
million. While KPM’s and TNG’s court challenges to those assessments
were pending, Kazakhstan issued a bankruptcy notice on February 3,
2010.

Page 267 of 414

. On July 16, 2010, despite being only given three days to respond to the
accusations of alleged violations of the Subsoil Use Contracts, KPM and
TNG provided detailed explanations refuting the State’s accusations.
Claimants’ timely responses were ignored, and Kazakhstan unilaterally
repudiated the Subsoil Use Contracts. (C-I { 332).

Kazakhstan failed to respond to Claimants’ complaints, despite having the ability
to do so, as it did upon receiving a hand-written complaint from four unknown
residents of the Mangystau Region in July 2010. This conduct violates the most
constant protection and security standard, as elaborated in Siag v. Egypt and Wena
Hotels v. Egypt. (CPHB 2 {iif 140 — 148).

Kazakhstan’s abrupt reversal of its 2007 commitment that it consented to the
Gheso — Terra Raf transfer of TNG obliterated “the agreed and approved security
and protection” of Terra Raf’s ownership of TNG. This was in violation of
Kazakhstan’s duties to provide “the most constant protection and security” to
Claimants’ investments. In addition, Claimants have endeavored to have the
MEMR withdraw its notices for breach of Contracts 210 and 302 for failure to
honor the State’s pre-emptive right, but Respondent took no action, effectively
hanging an indefinite cloud over Claimants’ reputation and title to TNG. (CPHB 2
ql 115 — 126).

With regard to Kazakhstan’s contention that “Claimants have not attempted to
show that Kazakhstan has failed to provide reasonable mechanisms of protection
and that the facts put forward by Claimants are ‘completely disconnected from
Claimants’ own legal understanding of the guarantee”, Claimants state that
Respondent’s assertion is contradicted by the facts. Claimants explain that “/this]
scheme was orchestrated by the President of Kazakhstan, other senior Government
officials, and the Financial Police was carried out by officials, judges, and law
enforcement and other agencies who, in violation of their duties and contrary to
Kazakh and international law, conducted a campaign of harassment and coercion
against Claimants from October 2008 until July 2010.” Claimants’ further
arguments that Kazakhstan’s conduct violated the most constant protection and
security standard of the ECT are best taken from their own words: (C-II { 491 —
492)

492. [...] the pretext for Kazakhstan’s conduct was a letter from President
Voronin to President Nazarbayev that provided the justification for
Kazakhstan’s actions. President Nazarbayev seized upon the opportunity
and ordered Kazakhstan’s State organs to effectively destroy Claimants’
investments in Kazakhstan.

493. In terms of physical security, Kazakhstan arrested and incarcerated Mr.
Cornegruta, the general manager of KPM, on trumped-up criminal
charges. The court decisions that sentenced Mr. Cornegruta to four years
in jail and fined KPM in excess of US$ 145 million were entirely
unfounded and unlawful because the provisions of Kazakh law relied on by
the Kazakh courts did not, and could not, justify the reclassification of
KPM’s 18-km pipeline as a main pipeline. The ridiculous calculation of
KPM’s allegedly enormous “profits,” and the sentencing of KPM — a
non-party to the criminal trial — were further travesties of justice.
Kazakhstan relied on the same frivolous legal grounds to initiate criminal

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 269 of 415
Page 268 of 414

actions against four other general managers of KPM and TNG and
threaten their arrest. Those four general managers had no choice but to
flee the country. Kazakhstan also summoned, interrogated, and threatened
a number of Claimants’ key in-country personnel, based on the same
manufactured allegations. Respondent also conducted searches and raids
of KPM’s and TNG’s offices, all in clear violation of the most constant
protection and security standard.

 

494. Furthermore, the Kazakh courts, the Prosecutor's Office, the Financial
Police, and numerous Government officials rejected Claimants’ repeated
protests, requests for assistance, lawsuits, and appeals filed by Claimants,
KPM, TNG, and Mr. Cornegruta. From the President of Kazakhstan to
the Financial Police, from the Governor of the Mangystau Region to the
MEMR (and its successor, the MOG), Kazakhstan colluded to deprive
Claimants of their investments.

495. Those State organs, including the courts, the central Government, and
local authorities, acting in blatant violation of Kazakh law and
international law, also harassed and coerced Claimants by requesting
payment of debilitating taxes and custom duties that were never due, by
refusing to extend the exploration period of the Contract 302 Properties,
and by reversing the State's prior waiver of its pre-emptive right for the
transfer of TNG to Terra Raf. (C-II {492 — 495).

1243. The intimidation, coercion, and threats by Kazakhstan, described in detail above,
violate the standards of full protection and security. Other tribunals, like Pope &
Talbot v. Canada, which found that the government’s threat to refuse to grant
future export quotas if the investor failed to cooperate with an audit, have found
much less intense and less threatening conduct sufficient to constitute a violation of
this standard. (CPHB 2 {| 49 — 51, 59).

2. Arguments by Respondent

1244.Contrary to Claimants’ assertion, Article 10(1) ECT extends only to physical
security and not to legal security. In addition, the prevailing view of tribunals in
investment treaty arbitrations is that the standard encompasses solely physical
protection and security. (R-II {{[ 957 — 960, 969 — 970).

1245.There are manifold reasons that tribunals have restricted the scope of the duty to
provide full protection and security to only physical damage and violence. Some
tribunals compare this duty with the customary international law duty relating to
aliens to provide full protection and security of foreign nationals. Under customary
international law, foreign nationals can expect to be protected from physical
damage, but not from legal instability. This is because customary international law
of aliens only establishes a minimum standard of protection. There is no reason to
expect that “/egal security” is included in the treaty, absent a statement to that
effect. (R-I {ff 36.3, 36.8 — 36.9; R-II {ff 961 — 964).

1246. Respondent also contends that the standards FET and “full protection and security”
have different substantive meanings. While the FET standard obliges the host state
to abstain from a certain course of action, the full protection and security standard
obliges the host state to actively create a framework which grants security.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 270 of 415
Page 269 of 414

Blurring these distinctions creates legal uncertainty. (R-I {{ 36.11; R-II {965 —
967). A further argument is best taken from Respondent’s words:

964. Another reason for the need to restrict the scope of the provision of full
protection and security to physical damage and violence is the fact that
this guarantee must have a meaning beyond, and distinct from, the
standard of fair and equitable treatment. Legal protection in terms of an
investor's legitimate expectation and its interest in a stable and predictable
business environment is already encompassed by the provision on fair and
equitable treatment. Claimants’ assumption that both provisions can be
read as comprising legal protection although they are stipulated
separately from each other violates the principle of systematic
interpretation, whereby a legal system is self-consistent and therefore no
provision can be contrary to another. Furthermore, Claimants’ assumption
violates the principle of effective interpretation, requiring a purpose and
object oriented interpretation, because the separate stipulation of two
provisions aims at establishing two distinct guarantees. (R-II { 964).

1247. Siemens v. Argentina, cited by Claimants in support of their contention that the
standard of most constant protection and security includes legal security, is
inapplicable here. That case concerned the Argentina-Germany BIT which
contained the term “/egal security” in the relevant provision on full protection and
security. The ECT does not expressly refer to legal security, and these facts have
been ignored by Claimants. As Respondent states, “by argumentum e contrario,
Claimants’ conveniently partial quotation of Siemens v. Argentina illustrates once
more that the guarantee of most constant protection and security does not
encompass legal security unless the investment treaty explicitly states otherwise.
Rather, it requires the host state solely to provide protection from physical damage
and violence.” (R-II {ff 971 — 972).

1248. The duty of ensuring most constant protection and security requires a host state to
diligently implement reasonable measures of protection, and the Republic has
provided such measures. The broad consensus, as reflected in the Noble v.
Romania, AAPL vy. Sri Lanka, and AMT y. Zaire cases, is that reasonable measures
are all that is required. Claimants even acknowledge that these cases confirm this
argument. The facts in the present case do not alter the general principle that the
duty of full protection and security is restricted by a concept of reasonableness.
(R-I {{f 36.4 — 36.5; R-II {{[ 973 — 978).

1249. Respondent’s response to Claimants’ comparison between Art. 10(1) ECT and Art.
10(12) ECT is best taken from its own words:

981. Whilst Article 10 (12) of the ECT requires the host state to implement
reasonable measures of assertion of claims and enforcement of rights,
Article 10(1) of the ECT requires the host state to implement reasonable
measures of protection and security. In particular, the guarantee under
Article 10(12) of the ECT refers to the legislative obligation of a host State
to provide a fair and efficient system of justice. This illustrates the
systematic coherence of the individual provisions within the ECT, not their
conflation. By drawing the comparison between Article 10(1) of the ECT
and Article 10(12) of the ECT, Claimants thus reinforce the fact that the

1250.

1251.

1252.

1253.

1254.

Page 270 of 414

implementation of reasonable measures is sufficient in terms of Article
10(1) of the ECT. (R-II J 981).

Further still, an obligation to provide “legal security’ would run contrary to the
purpose of the ECT. It would be vague and host states would be unable to
determine whether their legal framework was adequate for future tribunals to rule
in its favor. Such a standard, as expressed by the Saluka tribunal, would dissuade
host states from admitting foreign investments, thereby undermining the purpose of
the Treaty. (R-I'{ 36.10).

Claimants have not challenged that the Republic possesses the necessary legal
framework to provide protection from physical damage and violence to foreign
investors and investments. In order to prevail, however, Claimants must prove the
absence of reasonable measures. They have not met this burden. (R-I { 36.12; R-II
{982 — 984). Respondent explains:

985. It is undisputed that Claimants and their assets have not been physically
harmed and that not a single one of their representatives has been hurt. In
particular, Mr. Cornegruta and the other senior in-country managers of
KPM and TNG were not injured. As explained above, Mr. Cornegruta
received a fair trial and the verdict was upheld upon appeal. The alleged
harassment of company staff during the investigations did not result in any
physical harm of the employees either. Although Claimants contend that
the investigations rendered KPM and TNG an unsafe place to work, they
have not offered any proof thereof because, again, not a single employee
has been injured during these inspections and investigations. Apart from
that, as has been established above, company staff have never been
harassed but have rather experienced ordinary concomitants of lawful
investigations. (R-II J 985).

Further, Claimants’ assets were not taken by use of force. Claimants’ investments
have not been taken, but rather have been held in trust management ever since they
were abandoned by Claimants. To the extent that Claimants argue that their
investments were taken by use of force, however, under the ruling in SAUR
International SA v. Republic of Argentina, a take-over using police force does not
violate the guarantee of full protection and security. (R-I ] 36.13; R-II { 986).

Finally, the facts pleaded by Claimants do not relate to the guarantee of most
constant protection and security. Claimants have not proven that the alleged losses
and injuries would have been prevented but for the alleged insufficiency of
reasonable measures. As this has not been addressed by Claimants at all,
Claimants have failed to establish a breach of the Art. 10(1) ECT guarantee of full
protection and security. (R-I {{{[ 36.2, 36.12 — 36.15; R-II {{{[ 988 — 989).

3. The Tribunal

As explained above in the chapter on expropriation of this Award, it is the
Tribunal’s task to decide on the relief sought by Claimants as recorded above in
this Award. If such relief is granted on the basis of one particular ECT provision,
there is no need for the Tribunal to examine further whether the same relief would
also have to be granted on the basis of another ECT provision.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 272 of 415
Page 271 of 414

1255. Since, in a previous chapter of this Award, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion
that Respondent is liable for breach of the FET standard in Art. 10(1), it only needs
to examine a possible further breach of the obligation to provide most constant
protection and security to Claimants’ investment according to Art. 10(1) ECT, if
there is any other relief sought by Claimants not covered by the FET breach.

1256.Claimants’ allegation of this further breach leads to no further relief than that
resulting from the FET breach. In fact, the protections granted in this regard and by
the FET obligation overlap, though it may be arguable to which extent.

1257.There is, therefore, no need to examine whether such a further breach has been
shown.

J.V. Whether Kazakhstan Impaired Claimants’
Investment Through Reasonable and Non-
Discriminatory Measures (Art. 10(1) ECT)
(Alternative Claim)

1. Arguments by Claimants

1258. Article 10(1) ECT provides that “no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures” the “management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment or disposal” of an investment. To prevail in their argument under
Article 10(1) ECT, it is sufficient for Claimants that Respondent’s actions were
either “unreasonable” or “discriminatory.” Claimants present that Respondent’s
actions were both. (C-I {{[ 352 — 353).

1259. Claimants present that, “over the past several years, the Tribunals in BG Group v.
Argentina; Siemens vy. Argentina; ADC v. Hungary; Azurix v. Argentina; and
Saluka v. Czech Republic have all determined that conduct of a host State violated
an impairment clause, thereby breaching the relevant treaty.” (C-I1{ 517). While
Respondent does not dispute that measures need only to be arbitrary to violate the
ECT, Respondent nevertheless considers that this is a high threshold.
Respondent’s reliance on ELS/ for the position that it is a high threshold is
misguided. The definition of arbitrariness used in ELSI has faced criticism, since it
does not accord with the ordinary meaning of the term as required by Art. 31(1)
VCLT. None of the cases cited by Respondent have eschewed the ordinary
meaning of the term or limited the notion of “arbitrary” treatment to Kazakhstan’s
narrow articulation of the standard. (C-II {J 518 — 520).

1260. The term “reasonable” - interpreted according to its ordinary meaning as required
by the VCLT - means “based on or using good judgment and therefore fair and
practical.” In Saluka v. Czech Republic, the tribunal stated that “reasonableness”
requires a state’s conduct to bear “a reasonable relationship to some rational
policy.” Likewise, the tribunal in CME found the state’s actions to be unreasonable
because they were unjustified and improper. (C-I {{[ 355 — 357). Likewise,
“unreasonable” has been found to refer to a wider scope of acts that are intentional,
shocking or improper. (C-II {{ 523). As the EDF v. Romania tribunal found, such
unreasonable measures could include:

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 273 of 415

1261.

Page 272 of 414

a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any
apparent legitimate purpose;

a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice
or personal preference;

a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by
the decision maker;

a measure taken in willful disregard of due process and proper procedure.
(C-II J 523).

In this regard, Claimants present seven examples of Respondent’s conduct and
argue why these were actions that were arbitrary, shocking, and in willful disregard
to the due process of law. (C-II | 524; CPHB {I{[ 60 — 70, 97 - 114).

  

Kazakhstan’s “reclassification” of KPM’s and TNG’s pipelines as “main”
pipelines, despite there being no “main” pipeline as acknowledged by
numerous State authorities and agencies;

Kazakhstan's arrest, conviction, and incarceration of Mr. Cornegruta,
which did not serve any legitimate purpose, were not based on legal
standards, and were carried out in willful disregard of due process and
proper procedure;

Kazakhstan’s criminal verdict against the non-party KPM, freezing of
KPM'’s assets, and barring of KPM from lodging an appeal against its
conviction, which inflicted considerable damage on Claimants without
serving any legitimate purpose and violated applicable legal standards,
due process and proper procedure;

Kazakhstan’s retroactive reversal of its approval of the transfer of TNG to
Terra Raf and waiver of its pre-emptive rights, which did not serve any
legitimate purpose, had no legal basis, and violated due process; [see also
CPHB 2 {f 115 — 126).

Kazakhstan’s refusal to extend TNG’s exploration period in the Contract
302 Properties, ith ding its express apt l of the
(CPHB 2 {{ 149 — 176);

Kazakhstan’s imposition of the Crude Oil Export Tax on KPM, which
violated exemption and legal stabilization clauses in the Subsoil Use
Contract and inflicted damage on Claimants without serving any
legitimate purpose; and [see also CPHB 2 {J 127 — 139]

Kazakhstan’s wrongful and unilateral repudiation of KPM’s and TNG’s
Subsoil Use Contracts without any justifiable basis and without providing
the companies any opportunity to cure the alleged deficiencies. (C-II J
524).

1262. Regarding the retro-active reversal, Respondent did not have a pre-emptive right to
TNG in 2003 and, in any event, Respondent consented to the transfer in 2007. The

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 274 of 415
Page 273 of 414

retroactive refusal of consent clouded Claimants’ title to TNG and its reputation
and prevented Claimants from selling. (CPHB 2 {{f] 115 — 126).

1263.The main pipeline charges were, in any event, reverse-engineered fabrications.
The Financial Police first alleged that KPM and TNG did not have main pipeline
licenses. They then confirmed that they could impose a devastating penalty. Then
they sought out an authority to opine that the companies were operating trunk
pipelines. At the time, Kazakhstan knew that it could potentially recover 41 billion
Tenge (approx. USD 350 million) if the pipelines could be considered “main.”
(CPHB 2 {{{[ 61 — 68).

1264.A reverse-engineered criminal conviction would meet every definition of an
unreasonable measure provided in EDF v. Romania. (CPHB 2 {[ 69). The same is
true for every act of indirect expropriation. (CPHB 2 {{[ 69 — 70).

1265.The criminal allegation of “illegal entrepreneurial activity in an especially large
amount” under 190(2)(b) of the Kazakh Criminal Code was malicious and
contrived. They contrived the operation of the main pipeline to satisfy the “illegal
entrepreneurial activity” element of the crime. The second element, “in an
especially large amount” was manufactured by manipulating instructions to the
Tax Committee and calculating the “illegal profits” by including both the transport
fee KPM earned from TNG for use of the pipeline, as well as KPM’s entire
revenues from the onward sales of oil. This is contrary to Kazakh law, which
requires the deduction of lawfully obtained revenue from otherwise illegal activity.
The proper calculation would have yielded 12,000 — 13,000 in illegal profits. The
threshold for such a crime was USD 17,000. (CPHB 2 {{{] 80 — 84, 87).

1266.The term “discrimination”, means “differential treatment; especially, a failure to
treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction can be found between
those favored and those not favored.” It entails two elements: “first, the measures
directed against a particular party must be for reasons unrelated to the substance
of the matter .... Second, discrimination entails like persons being treated in an
inequivalent manner.” (C-I {J 358 — 359, partially quoted). Claimants present that
Respondent agrees with Claimants’ and the Saluka tribunal’s definition of
discrimination that “State conduct is discriminatory, if (i) similar cases are (ii)
treated differently (iii) and without reasonable justification.” (C-I { 525).

1267.Claimants argue that they have met their burden of proof regarding the similarity of
cases to establish discriminatory treatment. The extraordinary campaign of
harassment and coercion between October 2008 and July 2010, and the outright
seizure in July 2010 was discriminatory because these actions singled out KPM and
TNG. Respondent’s actions were also discriminatory because they singled out
Claimants for different treatment from other investors in Kazakhstan’s oil and gas
industry. Claimants present that no other investor’s in-field gathering systems
were reclassified as trunk pipelines, and that no other investors were subjected to
criminal prosecution based on that charge. Neighboring companies, including
KTM, operate similar pipelines as part of their in-field gathering system.
Furthermore, “if Kazakh ’s ion that a contractor’s pipeline dit
outside the Contract Area is a [trunk] pipeline were correct, hundreds of oil and
gas companies in Kazakhstan would operate [trunk] pipelines, but only Claimants’
companies have faced that charge.” All of the information available to the

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 275 of 415
Page 274 of 414

Tribunal suggests that the companies are comparable. Accordingly, as the
tribunals in Feldman v. Mexico and Nykomb held, once prima facie evidence of de
facto discrimination had been presented by the claimant, the burden of proof shifts
to the respondent to rebut the presumption of discrimination. Respondent has not
rebutted this presumption. (C-I {| 354 — 362; C-II {Jf 525 — 528).

1268.Respondent’s violations of the ECT’s impairment clause are beyond serious
dispute. The Saluka tribunal defined “impairment” according to its ordinary
meaning as required by Art. 31 VCLT as “any negative impact or effect caused by
measures taken by the host state.” While Respondent disputes that its conduct
“impaired” Claimants’ management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, and disposal of
their investments, this is belied by the facts. By the time of Respondent’s outright
seizure of Claimants’ investments in July 2010, Claimants’ investments in KPM
and TNG had already been impaired for twenty months. The intrusive audits
following President Nazarbayev’s 14 October 2008 order had just such a negative
impact. Likewise, the 18 December 2008 repudiation of the unequivocal approval
of the 2003 transfer of TNG to Terra Raf and the accompanying press release that
accused Claimants of forgery damaged Claimants’ ability to dispose of their assets.
In addition, Respondent cannot deny the financial burden that the audits and
inspections led by the Kazakh Financial Police had on Claimants. These audits
resulted in the improper assessment of USD 62 million of alleged corporate back
taxes in February 2009, the imposition of illegal export duties against KPM in
December 2008, and an intrusive 13-month audit of KPM and TNG with respect to
transfer pricing that began in November 2008. Respondent’s refusal to execute the
agreed upon extension of TNG’s exploration period for Contract 302 prohibited
Claimants from establishing the full market value of those properties. Finally,
“Kazakhstan's reclassification of the KPM and TNG gathering systems as [trunk]
pipelines, which resulted in criminal proceedings against four then-existing and
former general managers of KPM and TNG and a sham trial, conviction, and
incarceration of Mr. Cornegruta, clearly impaired Claimants’ ability to manage
their investments. Top personnel left the country and the conviction itself was used
to ultimately take over the companies. Similarly, Kazakhstan froze KPM’s assets
in an effort to execute the US$ 145 million judgment against KPM, thereby directly
impairing Claimants’ management, use, and enjoyment of KPM.” (C-II {J 529 —
535; CPHB 1 {{[ 207; CPHB 2 {| 149 — 176).

1269.The Subsoil Use Law changed on 24 June 2010 and permitted Kazakhstan to
terminate contracts when a contractor failed to cure two or more violations.
Respondent’s failure to offer Claimants an opportunity to cure the alleged contract
violations was not in good faith. As explained above, these minor violations did
not merit termination of the contracts, making the termination unreasonable. As
explained at the hearing, KPM and TNG received notices of alleged infringements
on 16 July 2010 and were required to cure by 19 July 2010. This was confirmed in
Mr. Pisica’s testimony. Even if the claims had been valid — and they were not — it
would have been impossible for Claimants to cure within the time given. (CPHB 1
ql 278 — 293).

2. Arguments by Respondent

1270. Respondent explains that is has adhered to its obligations under Article 10(1) ECT
at all times. Its measures were neither unreasonable nor discriminatory. The

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 276 of 415

Page 275 of 414

management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposal of Claimants’ investments
was not impaired in any way. (R-II { 1009).

Using Art. 31 VCLT, which requires that a treaty term shall be interpreted in
accordance with the ordinary meaning of the term, Respondent states that the
ordinary meaning of “unreasonable” is “irrational; foolish; unwise; absurd; silly;
preposterous; senseless; stupid.” Respondent submits that the Parties agree that
the term “unreasonable” is interchangeable with the term “arbitrary.” For this
reason, the ESLI court’s definition of the term “arbitrary” can be transferred onto
the term “unreasonable” in the sense of Art. 10(1) ECT. (R-II { 1011 — 1013).
The ELSI court’s definition was as follows:

[B]y itself, and without more, unlawfulness cannot be said to amount to
arbitrariness. [...] To identify arbitrariness with mere unlawfulness would be to
deprive it of any useful meaning in its own right. [...] Arbitrariness is not so much
something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed to the rule of law. [...] It
is a willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least
surprises, a sense of judicial propriety. (R-II 1012).

 

While Claimants have noted the similarities between the definition of
“unreasonable” and “arbitrary”, they overlook the conclusion that, given the
similarities of both definitions, customary international law and the ELS/ case both

blish a high threshold for to be idered “un. ble.” (R-II (fl
1013 — 1016). This is confirmed by scholars as well as by anecdotal evidence that,
“while 30 percent of arbitral tribunals find that certain state measures amount to
unreasonable or arbitrary conduct over all, only 22 per cent of those applied the
ELSI or a similarly high standard [...]. It is because of this high threshold
established in the ELSI case that findings of unreasonableness or arbitrariness are
rare.” In three of the cases cited by Claimants, the tribunals did not find that the
respective measures of the host state reached the allegedly low threshold of
unreasonableness. These cases were LG&E, National Grid PLC, and EDF y.
Romania. (R-II {{ 1016 — 1018).

 

It is untrue that the ELS/ standard for arbitrary treatment has been “the target of
much criticism.” Rather, the overwhelming majority of scholars and tribunals have
applauded the reasoning in the ELS/ case. The tribunal in Siemens v. Argentina
even adopted it as “the most authoritative interpretation of international law.”
(1019 — 1021).

Respondent also presents an additional argument that “wnreasonableness” is a high
standard:

1022. The adoption of a lower threshold would result in classifying all
governmental regulations adversely affecting foreign investors as
inherently suspect, thereby shifting the burden of proof from the foreign
investor to the host state. Forcing host states to demonstrate that their
measures were not unreasonable because there were no less restrictive
alternatives available would clearly contradict the onus probandi rule. For
this reason the ELSI standard is widely deemed to be the most
authoritative interpretation of the term “unreasonable”. Furthermore, in
view of the vagueness of all definitions of “unreasonable”, the legal
assessment of whether a certain measure is unreasonable or not remains a

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 277 of 415
Page 276 of 414

subjective process prone to unequal treatment and misjudgement. This
forms another reason why a high threshold is justified. (R-II { 1022).

1275.Respondent summarizes some case law on this point and presents how other
tribunals have used the ELSI test. In Genin v. Estonia the test was further
developed and refined, and the tribunal added the requirement “willful disregard of
due process of law.” The tribunal in CME v. The Czech Republic added a
subjective element, that “the host state’s intention to deprive the investor of its
investment as a pretext of a decision based on law.” Other tribunals, like Enron v.
Argentina and Sempra vy. Argentina considered the elements of arbitrariness,
finding that “regardless of intent, arbitrariness requires that some important
measure of impropriety be manifest.” Finally, the tribunal in Nobel v. Romania
found that an action would not be unreasonable if the proceedings of the kind in
question are provided in all legal systems for much of the same reasons. By
argumentum e contrario, only a measure which falls short of even such minimum
standard will be unreasonable. (R-II {{{[ 1023 — 1027).

1276.The Republic’s measures did not reach the threshold of unreasonableness
incorporated by the ordinary meaning of the term, let alone the one stipulated by
the ICJ in ELSJ. Respondent’s actions and inactions were lawful and were not
irrational or senseless or “unreasonable.” The measures were not shocking to
sense the judicial propriety in terms of the ELS/ standard. This is confirmed by the
fact that the Republic had no intention of depriving Claimants of their investments
(unlike the respondent in the CME case), and the measures undertaken are provided
for in all legal systems for much of the same reasons, just like Romania’s measures
in Noble v. Romania. (R-II §§| 1028, 1037). Respondent’s arguments related to
each action alleged by Claimants are best taken from its own words:

1029. First, Claimants allege that the Republic’s classification of KPM’s and
TNG’s pipelines as trunk pipelines was unreasonable. However,
Claimants had operated trunk pipelines without a licence. This was
confirmed by the Republic’s independent courts, warranting criminal
proceedings and the levy of a fine. The due amount of this fine was equally
assessed by an independent court. Also, the Republic only took
enforcement measures and froze KPM’s assets upon non-payment of the
fine. In conclusion, the Republic applied the law correctly and its
classification of KPM’s and TNG’s pipelines as trunk pipelines was not
unreasonable. (see also RPHB 2 {J 151 — 218).

1030. Claimants continue by suggesting it was unreasonable of the Republic to
arrest, convict and incarcerate Mr. Cornegruta. As to arrest, Mr.
Cornegruta had been identified by the Financial Police as the likely
individual responsible on behalf of KPM for illegal entrepreneurship
under Section 190(b) of the Criminal Code of Kazakhstan. The decision to
arrest him was taken on valid ground by the court in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the criminal code. As to the reasonableness of the
decision to convict Mr. Cornegruta, [...] process was a key part of the way
in which the decision and the later appeal of the decision against Mr.
Cornegruta was taken. The actions of the various authorities were taken
within the law.

Page 277 of 414

Subsequently, Claimants contend that the Republic’s “criminal verdict
against the non-party KPM” amounted to an unreasonable measure.
However, as set out above, the recovery order was necessary in order to
correct the unjust enrichment of KPM resulting from the criminal act of
operating the main pipeline without a license. Importantly, contrary to
Claimants’ allegations, the recovery order was made in a perfectly proper
procedure in which KPM was represented through its manager, Mr.
Cornegruta. [see also RPHB 2 {J 243 — 264].

Claimants also contend that it was unreasonable for the Republic to
“retroactive[ly] revers[e] [its] approval of the transfer of TNG to Terra
Raf and the waiver of its pre-emptive rights”. However, Claimants
actually failed to apply for the Republic’s consent at the time of the
transfer itself and they failed to prove that their belated request (after
being prompted by the MEMR) was legitimate under Kazakh law.
Furthermore, under Kazakh law, the Republic had the discretion to either
approve or disapprove the transfer. Even if the Republic had approved of
the transfer in the first place, a revocation of this approval was completely
lawful because Claimants wrongly informed the Republic about the
significant details of the transfer including the date when the transfer
occurred, which impacted on whether a waiver to its pre-emptive right was
required. Hence, the revocation of the alleged approval was not
unreasonable. [see also RPHB 2 { 272 — 281]

Moreover, Claimants complain that the Republic’s refusal to extend TNG’s
exploration period in the Contract 302 Properties was unreasonable. In

fact, under Kazakh law, the Republic was not legally bound to extend or

refuse to extend the exploration period in the Contract 302 Properties.
Also, since the Republic had not signed the necessary addendum,
Claimants could not rely on a prolongation of the exploration period.
Thus, the refusal to extend TNG’s exploration period in the Contract 302
Properties was not an unreasonable measure. [RPHB 2 {{ 282 — 318]

Claimants continue by alleging that the Republic’s imposition of the Crude
Oil Export Duties on KPM was another unreasonable measure. In reality,
Claimants’ invoked tax deductions which were provided for under Kazakh
law or were withdrawn by the relevant authorities before any payment was
made by KPM. This was confirmed by the independent Kazakh courts
which found KPM to be liable for paying the Crude Oil Export Duties.
Therefore, the Republic's assessment of Crude Oil Export Duties was
lawful and not unreasonable.

Finally, Claimants contend that it was unreasonable to repudiate KPM’s
and TNG’s Subsoil Use Contracts. The Republic was entitled to terminate
these contracts because of valid grounds for termination. Hence, the
termination of KPM’s and TNG’s Subsoil Use Contracts cannot be deemed
an unreasonable measure.

In particular, as more specifically set out in the introduction to the section
on direct expropriation, Claimants were in continuing and serious breach
of the Contracts. In accordance with its rights to do so, the Republic

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 279 of 415
Page 278 of 414

terminated the Contracts and Claimants’ assets were taken into a specific
trust arrangement. Claimants could have resolved this issue amicably by
invoking one of the mechanisms in the Contracts or, indeed, complying
with the voluntary mechanism in the Subsoil Law at article 72(10) for
handing over of assets to the trust and appealing the decision in
accordance with Article 73 of the Subsoil Law. The opportunity to resolve
this issue in accordance with the Contracts themselves and/or the Subsoil
Law was sidestepped by Claimants by filing substantive proceedings only
five days after the terminations. It is difficult to see how this behavior can
be considered unreasonable under the relevant test. (R-II {J 1029 — 1036,
partially quoted; see also R-I {J 41.9 — 41.17).

1277.Respondent’s measures were not discriminatory. As the Parties agree, a state’s
conduct is discriminatory if similar cases are treated differently without reasonable
justification. Once the investor has demonstrated that its case and a reference case
are similar, the burden shifts to the host state to demonstrate that there is a
reasonable justification for the differential treatment. Here, Claimants have not
proven the similarity between the cases of classification of pipelines and the
conviction of Mr. Cornegruta and respective other cases. In particular, they have
not established that the pipelines owned by KTM have features which would
require their classification as trunk pipelines, nor have they demonstrated whether
KTM holds a trunk pipeline license. Further, Claimants have not named a single
case where authorities did not initiate criminal proceedings after they discovered
the operation of a trunk pipeline without a license. Instead, they continue to make
the baseless accusations that the Republic singled KPM and TNG out for some
campaign of harassment. (R-I {41.14 — 41.24; R-II {| 1038 — 1043).

1278.Respondent’s conduct has not impaired Claimants’ investments. Contrary to the
onus probandi rule, Claimants have failed to prove that the Republic’s actions or
omissions had any negative impact on the management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment, or disposal of their investments, given Claimants’ own mismanagement
of KPM and TNG. (R-II {{f 1044 — 1045). Claimants have neither shown nor even
addressed whether the allegedly arbitrary measures caused their alleged loss. (R-II
4] 1052). Respondent’s arguments are best taken from their own words:

1046. First, [...] companies of KPM’s and TNG’s size operating in the subsoil
sector must be prepared [...] [for] audits and inspections. [They] were not
subject to any more audits or inspections than other subsoil users.
Further, when companies fail to comply with the law, they must expect to
be subject to audits and inspections. [...] Those audits were no more
intrusive than those undertaken at other companies that did not comply
with the law. Claimants have not proven that the audits and inspections
impaired Claimants’ management, use and enjoyment of their investments,
[as they have not proven how their daily management activities were
affected, whether there was a cut in dividends or why they could not sell
KPM and TNG].

1047. Claimants continue by suggesting that a press release, which notified
potential buyers that the Republic would assert a pre-emptive right over
TNG and accused Claimants of having forged documents in order to
defraud Kazakhstan, impaired the disposal of their investments. The so-
called press release Claimants refer to is in fact the INTERFAX-

Page 279 of 414

KAZAKHSTAN news agency piece about the reversal of the pre-emptive
rights waiver dated 18 December 2008. Claimants ignore that the reversal
of the pre-emptive rights waiver was perfectly lawful. Moreover, they have
not provided sufficient proof that it was this news agency piece that caused
Credit Suisse to step back from providing the bridge loan. Finally, the
news agency piece is not attributable to the Republic. For this reason the
so-called press release did not impair Claimants’ disposal of their
investments.

Furthermore, Claimants contend that the financial burden of corporate
back taxes, export duties and the audit of KPM and TNG with respect to
transfer pricing impaired Claimants’ management, use and enjoyment of
their investments. However, neither KPM nor TNG paid any of the
corporate back taxes or transfer price taxes. Claimants have made no
complaint and produce no evidence concerning payments of export duties
by TNG. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that Claimants were not
prevented from managing and enjoying their investments in the period in
question. In any event, Claimants could not reasonably expect that no back
taxes would be assessed and that the export duties would not be imposed
because the Republic was entitled to the payment of these levies.
Therefore, the financial burden resulting from these taxes did not impair
Claimants’ management, use and enjoyment of their investments.

Subsequently, Claimants allege that the Republic’s refusal to extend the
exploration period for the Contract 302 Properties impaired the

use and enjoy of their inves s because this
prohibited Claimants from establishing the full market value of these
properties. Claimants ignore that KPM and TNG could not reasonably
expect the exploration period under Contract 302 to be extended because
the Republic was free to decide whether to prolong the contract or not.
Hence, the Republic’s refusal to extend the exploration period for the
Contract 302 Properties did not impair the management, use and
enjoyment of their investments. [RPHB 2 329 — 330]

 

Also, Claimants complain that the “criminal proceedings against four
then-existing and former general managers of KPM and TNG and a sham
trial, conviction, and incarceration of Mr. Cornegruta” impaired the
management, use and enjoyment of their investments because top
personnel left the country and the Republic froze KPM’s assets. Again,
Claimants have failed to prove to the necessary standard how the criminal
proceedings affected their daily management activities, whether there was
a cut in dividends and how and why Claimants could no longer dispose of
KPM and TNG. Therefore, it is not evident that the criminal proceedings
really impaired Claimants’ management, use and enjoyment of their
investments. In particular, in respect of the repudiation of the alleged pre-
emptive rights waiver, and the press release on the same day, Claimants
have produced no evidence to suggest that the Republic was wrong in
highlighting its concerns about the legality of Terra Raf’s activities. As set
out in the Statement of Defence at paragraphs 13.47I(ii) and (iii) it was
perfectly appropriate to air its concerns to INTERFAX, given the
suspicions that Claimants had. It cannot be concluded from this that

Claimants’ investments were affected (or that if they were, that this was
inappropriate). In respect of paragraph 534, Claimants have not produced
any persuasive evidence that the top management left the country by
reason of the Republic's investigations into Claimants’ illegal activities or
that this impaired their investments. (R-II {{ 10-6 — 1050, summarized
and partially quoted, see also R-I {J 41.25 — 41.30).

As recorded aboveRespondent also maintains that it terminated Contracts 210 and
305 in accordance with the law, and that Claimants failed to file a timely appeal or
to request an extension, despite having ample time to do so. There was no
conspiracy regarding the creation of the heavily debated Subsoil Law 2010, which
took almost 2 years to pass. (RPHB 2 {{{{ 367 — 372).

3. The Tribunal

As explained above in the chapter on expropriation of this Award, it is the
Tribunal’s task to decide on the relief sought by Claimants as recorded above in
this Award. If such relief is granted on the basis of one particular ECT provision,
there is no need for the Tribunal to examine further whether the same relief would
also have to be granted on the basis of another ECT provision.

Since, in a previous chapter of this Award, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion
that Respondent is liable for breach of the FET standard in Art. 10(1), it only needs
to examine a possible further breach of the obligation according to Art. 10(1) ECT
not to impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures Claimants’ investment, if
there are any further damages sought by Claimants not covered by the FET breach.

Claimants’ allegation of this further breach leads to no further relief sought than
that resulting from the FET breach. In fact, the protections granted in this regard
and by the FET obligation overlap, though it may be arguable to which extent.

There is, therefore, no need to examine whether such a further breach has been
shown.

J.VI. Respondent‘s Observance of Obligations It
Entered Into With Respect to Claimants’
Investments (Umbrella Clause in Art. 10(1) ECT)

1. Arguments by Claimants

Article 10(1) ECT contains a broadly worded “umbrella clause.” The purpose of
this clause is to expand the reach of the ECT’s protections to obligations that are
not covered by the ECT’s other substantive provisions. The plain language of the
umbrella clause does not differentiate between contractual obligations and
legislative/regulatory undertakings. Four language versions of the ECT clearly
indicate that each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation that it has
undertaken towards (or, in two ECT versions, has assumed with regard to) an
investor or the investments of an investor of another Contracting Party. (C-I {{]
363 — 370; C-II { 537, 539, partially quoted).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 282 of 415

1285.

1286.

1287.

Page 281 of 414

That the umbrella clause does not differentiate between contractual obligations and
legislative undertakings has been confirmed by a number of investment treaty
tribunals, such as the Eureko v. Poland and the Enron vy. Argentina tribunals that
have confirmed that the umbrella provision extends to obligations undertaken
through law and regulation. Furthermore, in light of the other terms of the ECT,
including the ECT’s definition of investment, it is indisputable that Kazakhstan
undertook a number of contractual, legislative, and regulatory obligations with
regard to Claimants and their investments, which are protected under the umbrella
clause. (C-I {J 363 — 370; C-II {{ 537, 539).

Neither case on which Respondent relies to support its argument that a restrictive
reading of the umbrella clause is necessary actually stands for that contention. The
tribunal in Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan held that the ECT umbrella clause “is broadly
stated, referring as it does to ‘any obligation’ and, as such, by the ordinary
meaning of the words, includes both statutory and contractual obligations.”
Likewise, the CMS ad hoc committee held that an even broader reading was
possible — looking toward the law of the host state and possibly international law.
(C-II { 538).

Respondent’s argument that the arbitration provisions in the Subsoil Use Contracts
bar claims relating to those contracts under the umbrella clause is wrong, and it
conflates contract claims with treaty claims. Here, Claimants assert that
Kazakhstan breached its obligation to observe all obligations undertaken with
respect to their investments, and that includes its contractual obligations. This is
permissible under the ECT, which provides jurisdiction over disputes relating to an
investment for contractual claims that may arise under the umbrella clause.
Contractual forum-selection provisions, on the other hand, would naturally cover
only contractual claims (those belonging to KPM and TNG, rather than to
Claimants). Thus, the cases cited by Respondent — SGS v. Philippines and Bureau
Veritas — are plainly inapplicable to the present cases. In those cases, the claimants
were parties to the contracts at issue, making it not surprising that the tribunal
found that they were bound by the contract. Here, Claimants are not parties to the
contracts at issue. Further, the cases cited do not involve the types of government
measures that were involved here — and the tribunals in SGS v. Philippines and
BIVAC v. Paraguay were not asked to consider whether the breaches constituted
international treaty violations. Finally, in the B/VAC case, the tribunal held that “a

forum selection clause should not be permitted to override the jurisdiction to hear

1288.

1289.

Treaty claims of a tribunal constituted under that Treaty.” (C-I {| 540 — 542).

Turning to Respondent’s focus on the contractual forum selection clause, a cause
of action under the ECT is not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction clauses
contained in the underlying contracts, regardless of whether the treaty claims relate
to contractual issues. Claimants state that Art. 26 ECT allows foreign investors to
choose between a contractually agreed forum for international arbitration before
ICSID, UNCITRAL, or the SCC. The claimant’s choice is not constrained by the
forum selected in the contract. (C-II Jf 543 - 545).

Article 26(3)(c) ECT permits Contracting Parties to exclude international
arbitration for violation of the umbrella clause, but Kazakhstan has not exercised
this option. (C-II { 544).

Each of the following measures constitutes a distinct violation of the umbrella
clause:

[1] Kazakhstan “reclassified” KPM’s and TNG’s pipelines as “main”
pipelines, in violation of the approvals by its state authorities and agencies
for the design, construction, and operation of the “reclassified” pipelines
as in-field pipelines pursuant to Kazakhstan’s Law on Oil and relevant
regulations;

[2] Kazakhstan arrested, convicted, and incarcerated Mr. Cornegruta, in
violation of general principles of due process and Articles 12 and 16 of the
Kazakh Constitution recognizing each person’s human rights and
freedoms;

[3] Kazakhstan issued a criminal verdict against the non-party KPM, froze
KPM'’s assets, and barred KPM from lodging an appeal against its
conviction , in violation of general principles of due process and of Article
77(3) of the Kazakh Constitution;

[4] Kazakhstan approved the transfer of TNG to Terra Raf and waived its pre-
emptive rights, and then later rescinded its express approval and waiver;

[5] Kazakhstan refused to extend TNG’s exploration period in the Contract
302 Properties although it had expressly approved the extension;

[6] Kazakhstan imposed the Crude Oil Export Tax on KPM, in violation of
exemption and legal stabilization clauses in the Subsoil Use Contract;

[7] Kazakhstan imposed amortization rates at higher than contractually-
agreed rates, in violation of clear amortization and legal stabilization
provisions in the Subsoil Use Contracts;

[8] Kazakhstan wrongfully and unilaterally repudiated KPM’s and TNG’s
Subsoil Use Contracts, in violation of the contract terms; and

[9] Kazakhstan illegally seized Claimants’ investments, in violation of general
principles of law and Articles 6 and 26 of the Kazakh Constitution
protecting private property. (C-I {f 371 — 372; C-ll IY 546 — 547,
partially quoted; see generally CPHB | Jf 122 — 422; CPHB 2 {ff 97 -
114).

The 18 September 2009 judgment that sentenced Mr. Cornegruta to four years in
prison and ordered the recovery of USD 145 million from non-party KPM
constituted an egregious breach of Art. 10(1) ECT. Mr. Cornegruta was prevented
from presenting evidence on his behalf and the judge relied only on information
provided by the Financial Police. With regard to KPM, there is no theory of
“quasi-criminal” liability in Kazakhstan — Kazakhstan has blatantly misconstrued
clause 27 of the Regulatory Decree of the Supreme Court of June 20, 2005, “On
hearing of a civil action in criminal proceedings” and Article 371, section 1(10)
CPC to show otherwise. At most, Kazakhstan could have received compensation
for “property damage” in cases where no civil action was filed — and this is totally
inapposite to Mr. Cornegruta’s case, where there is no issue of property damage.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 284 of 415
Page 283 of 414

In order to recover funds from a company for alleged criminal conduct, Kazakhstan
would have had to have pursued a sanction under administrative law or file a civil
suit. Simply imposing Mr. Cornegruta’s fine on KPM was not an option. (CPHB 2
ql 97 — 114).

1292. Kazakhstan’s 2007 commitments regarding Terra Raf’s legal ownership of TNG
(namely, that the State’s pre-emptive right did not apply to the 2003 transfer) were
breached in violation of the umbrella clause. (CPHB 2 { 126).

1293.Respondent’s “spurious” tax assessments violated the terms of the Subsoil Use
Contracts and, likewise, were in violation of the ECT’s umbrella clause. (CPHB 1
{| 261; CPHB 2 {[ 139).

1294.When Kazakhstan failed to formalize the extension of Contract 302, which it
expressed on 19 March 2009 and wrote on 9 April 2009, it breached the ECT’s
umbrella clause. The promise to extend the contract was an express “obligation”,
giving rise to a treaty obligation under the umbrella clause, as well as a legal
obligation under Kazakh law to formalize the extension. Claimants legitimately
expected the contract to be extended, as it had been in the past. TNG made a
significant discovery in the Contract 302 properties at the Munaibay prospect, but
retracted the application in October 2008 after determining that Contract 302 held
greater reserves. It applied for an extension on 14 October 2008. The fact that
Claimants retracted the declaration of the commercial discoveries — discoveries
which would have given them the exclusive right to produce oil and gas from those
fields — is a demonstration of their legitimate belief that the contract would be
extended. Had the government been timely in addressing the application to extend,
Claimants would have had the opportunity to undertake the appraisal work and
declare commercial discoveries in the Contract area. Since the extension was
promised, Claimants had no need to do further appraisal. (CPHB | {{{ 221 — 237,
CPHB 2 {ff 152 — 162, 176).

1295. This is not a pre-contractual dispute. Kazakhstan undertook to extend the contract,
during the life of the contract. In the past, Kazakhstan granted an extension six
months after the previous exploration had expired, with no consequence in the
validity of the contract. Further, Kazakhstan treated the Contract 302 area as if the
contract were still in force, ordering the sequestration of those assets on 30 April
2009 and remarking on the fulfillment of the work conditions of Contract 302 in
2010. Kazakhstan’s actions demonstrate that it believed the contract to still be in
force through 22 July 2010, when it formally terminated Contract 302.
Respondent’s failure to execute the addendum after expressly committing to is a
violation of the umbrella clause. (CPHB 2 {J 163 — 171).

1296. Respondent’s repudiation of the Subsoil Use Contracts was also in violation of the
umbrella clause. There was no evidence that Claimants were in breach of any
aspect of the Subsoil Use Contracts, the minimum work requirements or of Kazakh
law, nor were they treating the fields badly. (CPHB 2 { 191).

2. Arguments by Respondent

1297.Contrary to Claimants’ assertion, the scope of the umbrella clause is limited to
contractual obligations and does not extend to alleged breaches of the Republic’s

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 285 of 415

1298.

Page 284 of 414

domestic law. According to the VCLT, the wording of the umbrella clause must be
interpreted such that its scope is limited to contractual obligations. The language
“to enter into” or “to undertake to bind oneself’, interpreted according to its plain
meaning as required by Art. 31(1) VCLT, illustrates the consensual nature of the
obligations in question. In addition, the use of the term “with” further indicates
contractual obligations because statutes and regulations are not concluded with an
individual party in one individual case. (R-II {[[ 1053 — 1058).

Article 31(1) VCLT clarifies that the context of each term is crucial. Thus, when
taking into consideration the ordinary meaning of “to enter into”, the reference to
“any obligation a party enters into” means “any obligation a party has undertaken
to bind itself to perform by an agreement” and thus “any contractual obligation.”
(R-II {| 1059).

Regarding the different language across each equally authoritative version of the
ECT, Claimants contend that four versions of the ECT refer to “obligations
assumed with regard to” whereas 2 versions can be translated to mean “fo enter
into.” Since all versions of the ECT are equally authentic, the ordinary meaning of
these terms is significant:

1063. The ordinary meaning of “to assume with regard to” in the context of
Article 10(1) of the ECT is “to take upon oneself; undertake”. When a
party takes an obligation upon itself, the party conunits voluntarily to
performing the obligation. Therefore, both terms, “to enter into” and “to
assume [with] regard to” contain an element of voluntary collaboration.
This element of voluntary collaboration makes sense when referring to a
contractual obligation because, self-evidently, both parties are free to
enter into a contract. It makes no sense when referring to a statutory or
regulatory obligation because these apply notwithstanding the intention of
those involved. Furthermore, it is general linguistic usage to say that a
party enters into a contract and assumes obligations with regard to a
contract, but it is not commonly heard that a party enters into a statute or
assumes obligations with regard to a regulation. (R-II { 1063).

If four versions of the ECT limit the scope of the umbrella clause to contractual
obligations, but two extend it to legislative, then there would be a difference in
meaning between the texts. In such a situation, Article 33 VCLT demands that the
Tribunal adopt the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the
object and purpose of the Treaty. The “contractual obligations only” interpretation
is, however, the common denominator of both meanings, best reconciling the texts.
The Tribunal should adopt this meaning. (R-I {{{[ 39.3 — 39.5; R-II {if 1064 —
1065).

The interpretation of Art. 10(1) ECT as only encompassing contractual obligations
is supported by the object and purpose of the ECT, which is to promote long-term
cooperation between investors and host states. If the umbrella clause were to
encompass regulatory or statutory obligations, every breach of a host state’s
domestic law would form a breach of the ECT. Had the contracting parties to the
ECT really wished to commit themselves to such a large extent, they would have
amended the wording of the umbrella clause accordingly. Construing the scope of
the umbrella clause to encompass statutory and regulatory obligations would
alienate the contracting parties to the ECT and might ultimately cause them to

1302.

Page 285 of 414

withdraw from the treaty. This would run counter to the ECT’s purpose of
promoting long-term cooperation of investors and host states. (R-II {{] 1066 —
1067).

Renowned scholars and tribunals alike have agreed that the scope of the umbrella
clause is limited to contractual obligations. The CMS v. Argentina, which
Claimants cite in their favor, clearly referred to consensual obligations under the
law of the host state or under international law. Statutes and regulations are not of
a consensual nature — only contracts are. Hence, the reasoning in CMS v.
Argentina demonstrates, contrary to Claimants’ assertion, that tribunals agree that
the scope of the umbrella clause is limited to contractual obligations. This view
was confirmed by the tribunal in Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan, which had to deliberate
on the umbrella clause in Article 10(1) ECT. Eureko v. Poland can be read to
mean that the tribunal regarded any contractual obligations with regard to
investments as encompassed by the scope of the umbrella clause — that tribunal did
not even deliberate on whether statutory or regulatory conduct toward an investor
constituted a breach of the umbrella clause. Further still, in SGS v. Philippines, the
issue under consideration arose from consensual obligations. As for LG&E v.
Argentina and Enron v. Argentina, the tribunals found that Argentina’s Gas Law
and its regulations were encompassed under the umbrella clause — but they
contrasted them from legal obligations of a general nature. Those cases concerned
specific promises made by the state concerning the laws, and those promises
transformed the laws and regulations into obligations within the meaning of the
umbrella clause. Respondent, thus, presents that all of the cases cited by Claimants
in support of their reasoning either does not support Claimants’ proposition, or
contradicts it. There is no reported investment law decision where the scope of the
umbrella clause was unconditionally extended to domestic law. (R-I {| 39.6 —
39.8; R-II {| 1068 — 1080).

The exclusive arbitration agreements in the Subsoil Use Contracts, as well as in
Contract 302, bar claims relating to these contracts under the umbrella clause.
Those contracts’ arbitration clauses oblige both parties to resort exclusively to
international commercial arbitration once a dispute arises with respect to those
agreements. Claimants have never referred the disputes regarding the Subsoil Use
Contracts or Contract 302 to international commercial arbitration. Foreign
investors need to comply with exclusive forum selection clauses before they may
rely on the umbrella clause because this conforms to and enforces the maxim pacta
sunt servanda. Therefore, the Subsoil Use Contracts and Contract 302 are utterly
irrelevant in terms of the umbrella clause. (R-I {J 39.9 — 39.12; R-II {9 1081 —
1086, 1097).

Tribunals in investment treaty arbitrations have ruled that foreign investors need to
comply with exclusive forum selection clauses before they may rely on the
umbrella clause. The tribunal in SGS v. Philippines clarified that a standard
jurisdiction clause in an investment treaty between two states does not override the
parties’ binding selection of a forum to determine their contractual claims, because
the contract between the parties needs to be regarded as /ex specialis in relation to
an investment treaty between two states. Respondent cites that this view has been
confirmed by scholars and other tribunals, including BJVAC v. Paraguay, which
added that contractual forum selection clauses needed to be regarded as a

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 287 of 415
Page 286 of 414

“voluntary waiver” of resort to the umbrella clause. (R-I fff] 39.9 — 39.12; R-II {if
1087 — 1095).

1305.Even if the Tribunal considers that the umbrella clause covers statutory and
regulatory obligations and that the Subsoil Use Contracts and Contract 302 were
relevant under the umbrella clause — which Respondent denies — the Republic
nevertheless complied with domestic law. Each of the actions alleged by
Claimants was consistent with and/or mandated by Kazakh law. (R-I {{ 39.13; R-II
ql 1098 — 1099).

1306. The classification of KPM’s and TNG’s pipelines as trunk pipelines was lawful. It
was found that KPM were operating a trunk pipeline without the relevant licence.
As a consequence, Mr. Cornegruta, KPM’s representative, was found guilty of
illegal entrepreneurship under Section 190(2)(b) of the Criminal Code of
Kazakhstan. This decision was confirmed on appeal on 12 November 2009 by the
Regional Court of Mangystau. It was Claimants that were in breach of Kazakh
law, not the Republic. Due process and Art. 77(3) of the Kazakh Constitution were
strictly adhered to in the investigation of the crime, as well as in the arrest,
conviction, and incarceration of Mr. Cornegruta on behalf of KPM. The procedure
of the recovery order — i.e. the recovery of illegal income of a company resulting
from the crime of its manager — was at all times in accordance with Kazakh law.
Procedural participation was safeguarded at all times through the presence of Mr.
Cornegruta. (R-II {| 1100 — 1103; RPHB 2 {{{[ 243 — 264).

1307.KPM and TNG were in serious breach of the terms of the Subsoil Use Contracts.
Claimants were aware of these breaches and had unsuccessfully contested them in
Kazakh courts. After notifying the companies of their breaches, the Republic
rightly terminated the Subsoil Use Contracts in accordance with Kazakh law and
the terms of the contracts themselves. The Republic’s termination of KPM’s and
TNG’s Subsoil Use Contracts did not violate the respective contract terms. Rather,
it was Claimants who breached the contractual terms, thus leading to a legitimate
termination. (R-II { 1104).

1308. There was no seizure of Claimants’ investments. There was a legitimate transfer
into trust management in accordance with the Subsoil Law 2010, which is the
lawful consequence following the termination of the Subsoil Use Contracts. This
transfer in any event only took place well after Claimants had abandoned their
investment. Since the Republic did not illegally seize Claimants’ investments, it
follows that the Republic did not violate general principles of law and Articles 6
and 26 of the Kazakh Constitution protecting private property. (R-II {{ 1105,
partially quoted; RPHB 2 {| 359 — 374).

1309.Regarding the transfer from Gheso to Terra Raf, there were 8 transfers that
involved majority shares in TNG, the consequence being that none of the after-
occurring transfers in TNG involving Claimants’ companies was completed.
Respondent’s belated consent to one transfer does not cure all other previous
failures. Thus, Respondent was fully justified in inquiring as to Claimants’
position with respect to TNG. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 272 — 281).

1310.At the Hearing on Quantum, Claimants alleged that the Republic’s gas market
breached the ECT’s protections under the umbrella clause, as well as the FET and

impairment provisions of the ECT. This argument fails since the Republic never
guaranteed an export market to Claimants. (RPHB | {| 698 — 700). This argument
did not appear in Claimants’ First Post-Hearing Brief and was not made in the final
hearing. It appears that Claimants have dropped this claim. (RPHB 2 {| 423 —
424).

The scope of the umbrella clause is limited to contractual obligations, as explained
in Siemens v. Argentina to mean “obligations [which] originate in a contract
between the State party to the Treaty and the foreign investor.” (RPHB 2 § 427).

Claimants have attempted to argue that the non-extension of Contract 302 is a
violation of the umbrella clause, but have failed to substantiate how such a claim
could exist under investment law. Claimants have not demonstrated any reliance
on the 9 April 2009 letter. In any event, Claimants have always accepted that
Respondent was not under an obligation to extend Contract 302. Even if there had
been no breach of the promise to extend the contract had not occurred, Claimants
still would not have had a claim to develop the Contract 302 area because the
contract would simply have terminated on 30 March 2009. Alternatively, even if
the 9 April 2009 letter constituted a decision to agree to extend Contract 302
(which is denied), that was only a unilateral act, not a contract. Such unilateral acts
are not covered by the umbrella clause. Additional steps, including an application
for a new license, would have needed to be undertaken to perfect the extension.
(RPHB 2 {if 292 — 305, 425 — 430).

3. The Tribunal

As explained above in the chapter on expropriation of this Award, it is the
Tribunal’s task to decide on the relief sought by Claimants as recorded above in
this Award. If such relief is granted on the basis of one particular ECT provision,
there is no need for the Tribunal to examine further whether the same relief would
also have to be granted on the basis of another ECT provision.

Since, in a previous chapter of this Award, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion
that Respondent is liable for breach of the FET standard in Art. 10(1), it only needs
to examine a possible further breach of the obligations it entered into with respect
to Claimants’ investments by the Umbrella Clause in Art. 10(1) ECT), if there are
any further damages sought by Claimants not covered by the FET breach.

Claimants’ allegation of this further breach leads to no further relief sought than
that resulting from the FET breach. In fact, the protections granted in this regard
and by the FET obligation overlap, though it may be arguable to which extent.

There is, therefore, no need to examine whether such a further breach has been
shown.

J. VII. Whether Kazakhstan Violated Its Obligation to
Permit Claimants to Employ Key Personnel of
Their Choice

Claimants encourage the Tribunal to interpret Art. 11(2) ECT in good faith and
under its ordinary meaning, pursuant to Art. 31(1) VCLT. (C-II {] 553 — 554).
Claimants’ argument is best taken from its own words, found at C-II {[ 555:

555. According to the ordinary meaning of Article 11(2) of the ECT, Claimants
were entitled to employ any key in-country personnel they wished.
However, Kazakhstan arrested and incarcerated Mr. Cornegruta, the
general manager of KPM, on trumped-up criminal charges. Moreover,
Kazakhstan relied on the same spurious legal grounds to initiate criminal
actions against four other general managers of Claimants and threaten
their arrest. Those four general managers had no choice but to flee the
country. Kazakhstan also summoned, interrogated, and threatened a
number of Claimants’ key in-country personnel, based on the same
manufactured allegations, so that Claimants had no choice but to recall all
their key personnel from Kazakhstan. Therefore, Kazakhstan violated its
obligation to permit Claimants to employ key personnel of their choice
under Article 11(2) of the ECT. (C-II 555).

Mr. Condorachi’s testimony confirmed that Claimants’ management decided that it
would be best if he and several other middle managers leave Kazakhstan, based on
their previous dealings with the Financial Police and the imprisonment of Mr.
Cornegruta. (CPHB 1 { 270). In addition, as explained by Mr. Broscaru, after the
14 October 2008 order, construction on the LPG Plant slowed significantly because
the non-Kazakh workers on the project were unable to renew their work permits.
(CPHB 1 {[ 358).

2. Arguments by Respondent

Article 11(2) ECT permits foreign investors to employ key personnel of their
choice, so long as such personnel have the required work and residence permits. It
prevents a host State from enacting any domestic employment legislation or
committing any forceful action that would prevent the foreign investor from hiring
key personnel. As scholars agree, this provision is unambiguous and does not
require interpretation. (R-II {J 1145 — 1147).

In response to Claimants’ argument that Art. 11(2) ECT needs to be interpreted
using Art. 31(1) VCLT, Respondent disagrees that there is ambiguity in other
terms, but agrees that the term “key personnel” could require interpretation, as it is
not defined in the ECT or any other investment treaty. The ordinary meaning of
“key personnel” refers to employees of the foreign investor which are
indispensable to the running of the investment and/or are decisive to the success of
the investment. The meaning of the term does not extend to other individuals.
Claimants have not proven that Mr. Cornegruta or any of the other unnamed four
general managers are part of such an exclusive group. It has not been alleged that
these are essential personnel. (R-II {J 1151 — 1154).

It is not true that the lawful interrogations and criminal proceedings against Mr.
Cornegruta on behalf of KPM or against the other four managers forced Claimants
to recall their key personnel from Kazakhstan. Respondent states, however, that it
“is notable that Claimants suggest that this should require the removal of their key
personnel from the country. This suggests that Claimants are willing to assist their
key personnel from facing the consequences of illegal behaviour. In turn this

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 290 of 415
Page 289 of 414

suggests that the detention of Mr Cornegruta in April 2009 (on suspicion that he
would flee the country) was well-founded.” (R-II {J 1156 — 1159).

3. The Tribunal

1322.As explained above in the chapter on expropriation of this Award, it is the
Tribunal’s task to decide on the relief sought by Claimants as recorded above in
this Award. If such relief is granted on the basis of one particular ECT provision,
there is no need for the Tribunal to examine further whether the same relief would
also have to be granted on the basis of another ECT provision.

1323. Since, in a previous chapter of this Award, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion
that Respondent is liable for breach of the FET standard in Art. 10(1), it only needs
to examine a possible further breach of the obligation according to Art. 11(2) ECT
to permit to employ key personnel according to Art. 11(2) ECT for Claimants’
investment, if there are any further damages sought by Claimants not covered by
the FET breach.

1324. Claimants’ allegation of this further breach leads to no further damages sought than
those resulting from the FET breach. There is, therefore, no need to examine
whether such a further breach has been shown.

K. Causation
KL Law on Causation

1. Arguments by Claimants

1325.Claimants agree that, as reflected in Art. 36 and 39 ILC Articles on State
Responsibility, Claimants bear the burden of demonstrating that the claimed
quantum of compensation flows from the host state’s conduct. Tribunals have
broad discretion in evaluating causation. As the tribunal in Lemire v. Ukraine
explained, the element of causation requires the aggrieved party to “prove that an
uninterrupted and proximate logical chain leads from the initial cause ... to the
final effect.” As the Lemire tribunal explained, the causal link need not be direct,
but can be established through a chain of connected events. The primary
limitation on the principle of transitive causation is that the chain of events must
be “neither too remote nor too aleatory.” Classically, what is necessary is to
prove that there is “no [break] in the chain and [that] the loss can be clearly,
unmistakably and definitely traced, link by link, to [the State’s] act, [whereby]
indirect losses are covered [so long as] in the legal contemplation, the [state's]
action was the efficient and proximate cause and the source from which they
flowed.” The requirement of proximate cause is closely related to the
foreseeability of injury — the wrongdoer could have foreseen that through
successive links, the irregular act would finally lead to damage. (CPHB 2 {if 199
— 202).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 291 of 415
Page 290 of 414

1326. The state is also responsible for all harm that proximately flows from its wrongful
actions, even if concurrent causes contributed to the harm. As the tribunal in CME
v. Czech Republic explained, the only exception to this would be in cases of
contributory fault.

1327.The burden then shifts to the state to prove that an intervening event — such as a
factor attributable to the victim or a third party — caused the damage alleged. As
the tribunal in CME v. Czech Republic explained, however, unless the injury can
be shown to be severable in causal terms from that attributed to the state, the
latter is held responsible. Kazakhstan, therefore, can only escape liability for the
injuries that naturally flowed from its conduct if it can prove that an intervening
cause completely superseded the effects of its actions into a severable injury, and
not merely that other concurrent events contributed to or amplified Claimants’
injury. (CPHB 2 {{f 200, 203).

1328.Finally, as the Tribunal in Lemire found, it is often not possible for a claimant to
prove with certainty what would have happened “but for” the State’s wrongful
actions. Thus, it is sufficient for the Claimants to prove that it was probable that
they would have had a different outcome, but for the State’s actions. (CPHB 2 4
204).

2. Arguments by Respondent

1329. Article 39 ILC Articles requires that the Claimants’ conduct be taken into account
in determining compensation. In investment cases, Tribunals have reduced
damages by a percentage reflecting the investor’s role in the events leading to a
loss. Even in the MDT v. Chile case, cited favorably by Claimants in their “full
compensation” arguments, the Tribunal reduced the damages otherwise due by 50
% to reflect the investors’ negligent conduct. Here, there is a clear correlation in
time between the companies’ financial troubles and Claimants’ conduct. (R-II {
436 — 440).

3. The Tribunal

1330. The Parties agree, and so does the Tribunal, that, as reflected in Art. 36 and 39 ILC
Articles on State Responsibility, Claimants bear the burden of demonstrating that
the claimed quantum of compensation is caused by the host State’s conduct.

1331.The Tribunal further agrees with Respondent that Art. 39 ILC Articles requires that
the Claimants’ conduct be taken into account in determining compensation.
Indeed, in investment cases, Tribunals have reduced damages by a percentage
reflecting the investor’s role in the events leading to a loss.

1332. And the Tribunal agrees with Claimants that the burden then may shift to the state
to prove that an intervening event — such as a factor attributable to the victim or a
third party — caused the damage alleged, unless, as the tribunal in CME v. Czech
Republic explained, the injury can be shown to be severable in causal terms from
that attributed to the state.

KIL. Whether Respondent’s Breaches of the ECT
Caused Claimants’ Alleged Damages

1. Arguments by Claimants

1333.The campaign of harassment and coercion that began in October 2008 and was
publicized in December 2008 initiated a chain of events that irreparably harmed
Claimants’ investments and prevented Claimants from fully developing or
alienating them from that moment forward.

1334.Claimants’ search for bridge financing in November 2008 began on
recommendation from Renaissance Capital. It was necessary in order to obtain a
partial advance on the proceeds of the sale in order to reinvest them into other
projects as soon as possible and, as Mr. Lungu explained, to protect against falling
oil and gas prices. Further, although Kazakhstan sabotaged the Credit Suisse
financing in December 2008, the liquidity position at KPM and TNG did not
become problematic until the June 2009 Laren transaction. Respondent’s argument
about the “going concern” qualification issued by the auditors’ is also disingenuous
and expressly states that the “going concern” qualification was based on events
after 31 March 2009. The reasons for this qualification were Kazakhstan’s
freezing of KPM and TNG’s assets and Claimants’ equity interests in KPM and
TNG, the criminal investigations, and the USD 62 million back tax assessment.
Finally, Claimants’ financial position as of June 2009 was mainly due to
Kazakhstan’s conduct — it does not reduce the impact of Kazakhstan’s interference
on the Credit Suisse financing, but rather amplifies it. (CPHB 1 {[[ 405 — 408).

1335.Two events - the 18 December 2008 INTERFAX publication, which extensively
quoted the MEMR’s false accusations of forgery and violations of registration
requirements, and the 15 December 2008 formal initiation of the criminal
investigation against KPM — had a profoundly negative impact on Claimants’
reputation and the value ascribed to their investments in capital markets. Based on
those events, on 14 January 2009, Fitch ratings agency placed Tristan’s long-term
default rating and senior unsecured rating of B+ on the Rating Watch Negative.
Fitch warned investors that the MEMR’s cancellation of its pre-emptive rights
waiver could result in the termination of TNG’s Subsoil Use Contract. On 15
January 2009, Moody’s placed Tristan’s B2 rating on review for a possible
downgrade, again based on both events. Accordingly, Kazakhstan’s wrongful acts
had a profound impact on the value of Claimants’ investments not later than 14
January 2009. (CPHB 1 {{{[ 346 — 357, 646 — 647; CPHB 2 {| 205 — 209).

1336.The INTERFAX article directly interfered with a specific financing transaction that
Claimants were then negotiating with Credit Suisse. On 18 December 2008, Mr.
Petrosius of Credit Suisse sent Mr. Lungu the INTERFAX article and requested his
comments. After that, Credit Suisse refused to provide the bridge loan until
Claimants resolved their disputes with the Kazakh government. Kazakhstan’s
argument that Claimants have not proven that the MEMR’s actions caused the
Credit Suisse loan to fall through is not persuasive. Moodys and Fitch confirmed
that the MEMR’s actions against KPM and TNG raised concerns to the companies’
ability to service their existing debt. It would have been surprising if any lender
would have gone forward with the new financing without resolution of the
conflicts. (CPHB 2 {{f[ 210-211).

Page 292 of 414

The financial crisis did not prevent the Credit Suisse transaction. Credit Suisse
stated on 5 December 2008 — after the crisis erupted in September 2008 — that it
aimed to execute the term sheet the following week. (CPHB 2 {{ 212).

The inability to receiving financing forced Claimants to enter into the Laren
transaction in June 2009. It was a necessary transaction that was on horrible terms,
which caused Moody’s and Fitch ratings agencies to further downgrade Tristan’s
debt to the C level. Respondent’s illogical and speculative argument that
Claimants would have turned to the Laren loan sharks in August 2009 to refinance
the Credit Suisse loan ignores the State’s actions, completely. If Claimants had
needed to refinance, they would have been able to do so on ordinary commercial
terms, possibly even with Credit Suisse, on the same or better terms, since oil
prices and credit markets had improved dramatically by that time. Respondent’s
argument that the Credit Suisse loan would not have helped Claimants to avoid the
Laren loan is speculative and nonsensical. (CPHB 2 {[ 213 — 214).

The evidence that Kazakhstan’s conduct interfered with Claimants’ ability to sell
their investments in KPM and TNG is overwhelming. First, the MEMR leak to
INTERFAX clouded Claimants’ title and reputation. Second, Kazakhstan
sequestered Claimants’ shares in KPM and TNG and KPM’s and TNG’s Subsoil
Use Contracts, pipelines, and vehicles on 30 April 2009. Claimants were thereafter
legally prohibited from selling their investments, through sale of either shares or
assets. (CPHB 2 {ff 233 — 235).

The clouded title resulting from the INTERFAX press release interfered with
Claimants’ ability to sell KPM and TNG as of 30 April 2009, when Kazakhstan
froze the shares in the companies. Kazakhstan’s actions also affected several
potential buyers in the Project Zenith sale process, to which Mr. Suleymenov
testified. This affected price, as the RBS Report confirms that RBS and KMG
E&P deducted liabilities attributable to Kazakhstan from their valuation. In
addition, the KMG E&P confirmed its valuation by examining the trading price of
the Tristan debt, which was also negatively affected by Kazakhstan’s actions.
(CPHB 1 {{{[ 384 — 389).

Kazakhstan’s actions interfered with TNG’s sales. Claimants inferred that
Kemikal’s sudden and inexplicable refusal to post bank guarantees that were
required by its credit terms was part of Respondent’s aggressive and hostile
campaign to put pressure on Claimants. At the time, Kemikal was controlled by
President Nazarbayev’s son-in-law, Mr. Kulibayev. As a result, Claimants did not
renew the contract with Kemikal when it expired at the end of 2008. Respondent
frustrated TNG’s attempts to find replacement buyers in summer 2009 in two
ways. First, Respondent prevented TNG from selling gas on export markets
(which required access to the CAC Pipeline, which required Claimants to sell
through a Kazakh government affiliate, either Kemikal or KazRosGaz). Second,
the arrest of Mr. Cornegruta and the inspections and harassment caused the
management of TNG to devote much of their time responding to the State’s
harassment, rather than the day-to-day management of the company. Many
managers wisely fled the country. As a result of being compelled not to renew the
Kemikal contract and of being unable to find a replacement, TNG had to shut down
production by 30 — 50% from March — July 2009, and by 100% for two weeks in

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 294 of 415
Page 293 of 414

August 2009. TNG produced 17 BCF of gas and 311,000 barrels of condensate
fewer than its own targets. (CPHB 2 {{{[ 223 — 227).

1342. Advisors to the State controlled oil company, KMG EP, confirmed that the State’s
actions were material impediments to any acquisition of KPM and TNG. Squire
Sanders recommended that KMG EP make the return of the companies’ documents
and the termination of the criminal proceedings and attachment orders a condition
on any transaction. Those accounts posed an insurmountable obstacle to the sale of
KPM and TNG to buyers other than KPM EP, who may have had the clout to stop
the criminal actions. (CPHB 2 {[ 236).

1343.PwC identified financial and tax issues that were directly attributable to
Kazakhstan’s wrongful actions as impediments to the purchase by KMG EP or, at
least, issues to be considered in valuing KPM and TNG. The RBS valuation
included USD 243.5 million in contingent liabilities, most of which are attributable
to Kazakhstan. RBS disregarded the potential exposure of up to USD 1 billion in
criminal fines, but suggested that those could be dealt with in the SPA — something
only perhaps no other purchaser but KMG EP could have accomplished. Mr.
Suleymenoyv testified that KMG EP valued the companies’ equity in the range of
negative USD 50 — 100 million after deducting the Tristan debt and contingent
liabilities. Importantly, however, the Tristan debt alone would have been USD 111
million less but for Kazakhstan’s action. Thus, KMG EP’s valuation would have
been positive, but for KMG EP’s action. (CPHB 2 ff] 237 — 238).

1344.The market price of the Tristan debt was negatively affected by Kazakhstan’s
illegal actions. It was also misquoted by Mr. Suleymenov, when he stated that the
market price of the Tristan notes was only 25 — 28 cents on the dollar, when it was
nearly double that on the date of the RBS valuation. Mr. Suleymenov
acknowledged that the trading price of the Tristan notes no doubt incorporate
Kazakhstan’s actions. (CPHB 2 § 239).

1345.Finally, when Claimants submitted the Cliffson transaction to the MOG for
approval in 2010, the MOG conditioned the sale on the satisfaction on all legal
obligations imposed by the state and the release of the sequestration orders. The
sale could not be concluded. Claimants have proven that Kazakhstan’s actions
were the primary reasons that KMG EP did not buy KPM and TNG. Other
potential buyers, like Total lost interest when the State precluded Claimants from
completing the exploration well. Dr. Kim of KNOC testified that the inability of
TNG to export gas was the principle reason that KNOC lost interest. Mr. Seitinger
testified that OMV decided against the purchase for market reasons, but those were
also influenced by Kazakhstan. Even with the global financial crisis, it is beyond
serious doubt that KPM and TNG became unattractive assets as a result of
Kazakhstan’s actions, and that Kazakhstan is responsible for all of the injury to
which its actions contributed. (CPHB 2 {[[ 240 — 245).

1346.The final expropriation in July 2010 caused the direct and egregious injury to
Claimants, who thereby lost their remaining ability to sell the assets, to use them
productively, and to direct the cash flows from those assets to the creditors. The
seizure was just the final step in a series of actions starting in late 2008 that
impaired Claimants ability to profitably and successfully operate, manage, control,
and dispose of their investments. (CPHB 2 {[ 246).

2. Arguments by Respondent

Initially, Claimants argued that the inspections and investigations initiated in
October 2008 had a severe impact on the operations of KPM and TNG. Now,
however, they have abandoned that claim. At the hearing, Mr. Cojin even testified
that the inspections and investigations “could not disturb” the people at TNG who
were “very busy with production.” Instead, Claimants now focus on the lack of
funding of KPM and TNG which they allege to have been caused by the Republic.
(RPHB 2 {ff 92 — 94, 126).

Claimants now argue that the INTERFAX press item of 18 December 2008 caused
an injury to Claimants’ reputation and ability to get credit. It should be pointed out
that in the first hearing, when asked about what caused the cashflow problems in
2009, Mr. Lungu made no mention of the pre-emptive rights waiver issue.
Regardless, the INTERFAX item cannot be attributed to the Republic. It was not
issued by the Republic. INTERFAX obtained the information from unofficial
sources. Claimants have not shown that the Republic was in any way involved in
the publication of the item. (RPHB 2 {f{[ 95 — 97).

Claimants’ case that the pre-emptive rights waiver issue harmed their ability to
secure financing boils down to the negotiations with Credit Suisse for a bridge loan
(which could have collapsed for any number of reasons) and Mr. Lungu’s non-
credible and illogical testimony. Under Mr. Lungu’s testimony, the Credit Suisse
loan would have needed to be refinanced in August 2009 already — Claimants, thus,
would have needed to turn to the Laren loan sharks in August 2009 instead of June
2009. To the extent that Claimants have argued that the INTERFAX item
prevented them from getting financing on more commercial terms, Claimants have
provided no evidence to support this, especially in light of the other problems
relating to the drop in demand and the increase in need for capital expenditure.
Finally, Respondent denies the unproven contention that Laren is not an affiliate of
Anatolie Stati. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 98 — 104).

Respondent denies interfering with gas sales of KPM and TNG. The loss of
Kemikal as a customer is not attributable to the Respondent since, as confirmed by
PwC, that was due to Kemikal’s own liquidity issues. Kemikal is a private
company that was not acting in any kind of governmental capacity. It has not been
managed by the State. (RPHB 2 {| 124 — 126).

Claimants have not shown any legal authority in favor of lowering the standard of
proof regarding the alleged interference with the sale of KPM and TNG. None of
the causes complained of mentioned by Claimants played any role in the
companies’ decisions not to purchase KPM and TNG. Claimants’ failure to sell the
companies had nothing to do with the Republic’s actions. Rather, it was caused by
the lack of commercial activity of KPM and TNG. Any interest that may have
existed on behalf of some market players vanished upon closer review of the
companies. (RPHB 2 {| 135 — 137, 150).

Anatolie Stati was dishonest in his testimony in both hearings. His testimony was
inconsistent with that of other witnesses. In particular, he informed the Tribunal

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 296 of 415
Page 295 of 414

that Kazakh authorities allegedly told Total EP and KNOC that it would not permit
sale. The testimony of Mr. Chagnoux of Total EP and Dr. Kim of KNOC,
however, confirmed that no such talks with Kazakh authorities had taken place.
(RPHB 1 {ff 112).

1353.Claimants’ arguments regarding the involvement of KMG EP are confusing and
fundamentally inconsistent. On the one hand, KMG EP was part of the alleged
harassment campaign, and on the other, Claimants treat KMG EP as a purely
commercial entity for the purpose of their alienability arguments. In any event, it
was not State actions that led to the KMG EP decision not to go forward with the
deal. “As the RBS valuation showed, KMG EP assumed in the base case an
enterprise value between USD 473 million and USD 751 million for KPM and
TNG (taking into account potential synergy effects). At the same time, KPM and
TNG were liable for USD 531.1 million in noteholder debt with an interest of
10.5%. In other words: There was a considerable likelihood that the equity value
of KPM and TNG was negative even disregarding any other liability but the
noteholder debt.” Neither the pre-emptive rights waiver issue nor the sequestration
of shares played any role. (RPHB 2 {| 146 — 149).

1354. Total E&P’s ultimate lack of interest in purchasing KPM and TNG was that Total
E&P was looking for situations in which they could add value or increase the
reserves. In KPM and TNG, there was no such additional value. There is nothing
incredible about this testimony and Claimants’ attempts to discredit the witness,
Mr. Chagnoux, are ridiculous. Mr. Chagnoux testified credibility and even
discussed Total E&P’s strategic decision to gain access to the data room by putting
a value on the worthless LPG Plant. In any event, the Respondent did not hinder
the sale by preventing Claimants from proving the resources in the Interoil Reef.
TNG failed to prove these reserves, failed to drill deeply enough after the drill
broke down, and failed to conduct a full and thorough 3D seismic analysis that
covered the entire reef. Claimants, and not Respondent, are at fault. (RPHB 2 {If
138 — 142).

1355.In a fundamental reversal to Claimants’ earlier positions, Claimants now agree that
the lack of gas sales contracts caused KNOC to lose interest in KPM and TNG,
despite testimony of their own witnesses, Anatolie Stati and Mr. Lungu, that the
Kazakh authorities deterred KNOC. TNG’s inability to secure gas contracts had
nothing to do with the Republic. (RPHB 2 {| 143 — 145).

3. The Tribunal

1356. As indicated above in this Award, the Tribunal notes that the Parties’ submissions
indicate that the Claimants’ investment proceeded in a more or less normal fashion
before the Order of the President of the Republic on 14/16 October 2008.

1357.Prior to the 14/16 October 2008 order, Claimants were involved in three-way
negotiations, at the behest of Kazakhstan, beginning in 2007. On 7 May 2007, the
MEMR, the Governor of the Mangystau Region, KMG, KazAzot, Ascom, KPM,
and TNG entered into a MOU that TNG would sell certain volumes of gas to
KazAzot first at near market prices followed by the international market price after

Page 296 of 414

two years and, further, that through KazTransGas, TNG would be allowed to
export certain volumes of gas at international market prices. (C-300). It was argued
that TNG was ideally suited to be considered as the primary supplier to the
ammonia-carbamide project as it was the fourth largest producer of gas, it was
locally situated, and it was a reliable provider of gas in large quantities. Over the
following year, extensive negotiations took place among the parties regarding such
issues as prices, volumes, and other conditions of the agreement.

Beginning in 2007, TNG, in addition to its efforts to pursue what became the Tri-
Partite Agreement, had also pursued gas sales opportunities with Kemikal.
Claimants argue that this entity was believed to be under the control of the son-in-
law of President Nazarbayev, Mr. Timur Kulibayev. Deliveries to Kemikal began
in October 2007 and continued throughout 2008.

On 28 April 2008, the MEMR, KMG, TNG, KazTransGas, and KazAzot made a
first agreement among TNG, KazAzot, and KazTransGas. (C-301). A further Tri-
Partite Agreement followed between TNG, KazTransGas, and KazAzot setting out
the formula for the price calculation, the volumes of gas concerned, and the
conditions of supply and export. (C-302).

TNG's Contract 302 initially had a six year term. As a result of flooding from the
Caspian Sea basin, the MEMR extended the exploration term for two years and
eight months, until 30 March 2009. The MEMR did not count this force majeure
against the two permissible contract extensions, which in any event required
consent of the Republic. (R-I {ff 14.20 — 14.25; R-165). On 24 July 2008, TNG
informed the Geology and Subsoil Use Committee of the MEMR that it had
discovered an oil and gas field by drilling the Munaibay-1 well in the Contract 302
area. Anatolie Stati testified that during the summer of 2008, TNG purchased a
more robust drilling rig in Georgia with the intention of resuming the completion
of the Munaibay-1 well and further exploration of the Contract 302 area. (Tr.
January 2013 Hearing Day 2 pp. 84, 114-115). On 11 August 2008, TNG applied
to move to the appraisal phase for Munaibay. TNG withdrew the appraisal
application on 10 October 2008 because it believed it was too early to begin
appraisal. (C-0 {[ 57; C-I { 67; CPHB 1 {{ 129; 234; CPHB 2 {[ 151; C-66). Instead,
on 14 October 2008, TNG notified the MEMR of its intention to exercise its
contractual right to extend the exploration period by two further years pursuant to
Contract 302. On 14 October 2008, TNG submitted its formal application to
extend the exploration period Contract 302 by two years. Among other things, this
application refers to the “/dJiscovery of new HC deposits on depths of over 5-6
km...” and “large deeply submerged reef fields...” (C-67, partially quoted). The
Claimants say these are unmistakable references to the Interoil Reef structure and
that this application further indicated TNG's plans to complete the Munaibay-1
well. (C-I {| 67; CPHB 1 {[ 129, 234 — 235; CPHB 2 {| 151; R-I {| 31.68; R-II { 416;
C-66; C-67; Lungu Tr. January 2013 Day | pp. 250 — 251).

Following the direction of President Nazarbayev on 14/16 October 2008, the
Deputy Prime Minister promptly issued Order No. 6497 on 16 October 2008,
which ordered the MEMR and the Tax and Customs Committees to conduct
comprehensive and complex audits of KPM, TNG, and Kok Mai. These audits
began on 28 October, 10 November, and 18 November 2008, respectively.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 298 of 415
Page 297 of 414

1362.Under the direction and sometimes even the supervision of the Financial Police,
KPM and TNG faced relentless inspections, including by:

- The Customs Committee (18 October 2008, C-11);

- The MEMR (20 October 2008, C-9);

- The Tax Committee (24 October 2008, C-10);

- The Geology Committee (28 October 2008, C-12);

- The Ecology Committee (28 October 2008, C-13);

- The MES (31 October 2008, C-14); and

- The National Bank of Kazakhstan (November 2008, C-15);

1363.KPM's former General Manager and subsequently Deputy General Manager of
TNG, Alexandru Cojin, stated that these investigations and inspections were
voluminous and harassing. He testified that the process began around November
2008 and continued for nearly two years. (WS Cojin {{{ 6 — 8). Similarly, KPM's
and TNG's Technical Director, Victor Romanosoy, testified that “normal”
inspections in the field had previously occurred once yearly, but commencing in
late 2008 and continuing thereafter, the frequency of these inspections increased to
every quarter, such that, “/a]s a result, [he] met with representatives from nearly a
dozen agencies for weeks at a time every three months.” (WS Romanosov | {{ 26).
These investigations were unprecedented for KPM and TNG. Claimants provided
evidence that these actions became an almost daily intrusion into the operations of
KPM and TNG, so much so that many staff members were more occupied with
responding to the inspections than with their normal everyday responsibilities.

1364. The following events are also of relevance:

1365. In fall 2008, Kemikal — TNG’s largest non-local customer — failed to post the bank
guarantees that were part of its required payment terms. These terms were required
because Kemikal's payment history was erratic and large arrears accrued.
Accordingly, TNG did not renew the contract with Kemikal at the end of that year.
It required collection efforts until June 2009 for TNG to receive payment from
Kemikal.

1366.A 17 November 2008 Tri-Partite Agreement between TNG, KMG (who had
replaced KazTransGas), and KazAzot memorialized their agreement on price,
volumes, and related conditions of sale and export. (R-393). TNG and KMG
signed this Tri-Partite Agreement. It was hand-delivered to KazAzot for its
signature, but KazAzot never signed. Instead, in late November 2008, KazAzot
requested that KMG perform another audit of the ammonia-carbamide complex
project, especially regarding the delivery prices of gas. KazAzot allegedly
indicated at that time that it would sign the Tri-Partite Agreement within six
months, subject to the outcome of this audit.

1367.Claimants attempted to obtain a bridge loan to provide additional working capital
in connection with their decision to put the companies on the market. On 5

December 2008, Credit Suisse sent Claimants a term sheet for a USD 150-175
million facility. (C-II { 381). Respondent states that this shows that Claimants
likely began looking for financing in November 2008. (R-II fn. 775).

1368.On 18 December 2008, the MEMR informed TNG that it was “cancelling” the
State’s explicit ruling of 20 February 2007 that allowed the 2003 transfer of TNG
from Gheso to Terra Raf. The MEMR demanded that TNG submit a new
application for the transfer. The notice required TNG to submit all documentation
regarding Terra Raf’s ownership within 10 days, and that failure to do so would
result in the MEMR unilaterally terminating TNG’s Subsoil Use Contracts for the
Tabyl Block and the Tolkyn field. (CPHB 2 {ff 38, 117; R-I { 13.47; R-II J 170 —
172; RPHB | {| 475 — 476; RPHB 2 {{{[ 281, 377; C-134; C-140; C-424; Illyassova
(12 August 2012) {.7; WS Ongarbayev {[ 5.7).

1369. The Parties agree that, on 18 December 2008, INTERFAX issued a press release
containing allegations that the Claimants had altered documents in order to defraud
the State of its pre-emptive right to purchase the companies.

1370. Immediately after its publication, Credit Suisse sent Mr. Lungu of Ascom the
INTERFAX press release and requested an explanation. (C-625). After
discussions, Credit Suisse informed Claimants that it would not provide the bridge
loan until Claimants resolved their disputes with Kazakhstan. (C-II {{ 381; CPHB 2
QM 117, 210 — 211; WS Lungu 1/7).

1371.On 22 December 2008, TNG refused to submit the required application before the
MEMR and lodged objections to the State’s reversal of its consent to the 2003
transfer. (C-I J 146; CPHB 2 { 117; C-142).

1372.Anatolie Stati testified that, following the State's actions in relation to its
revocation of its previous waiver of pre-emptive rights regarding the transfer to
Terra Raf, beginning December 18, 2008, he concluded he should be careful
regarding the Kazakhstan Government's intentions. (Tr. January 2013 Hearing Day
2, pp. 84, 114 — 115). Thus, although this rig was ready for transport in January
2009, the newly purchased heavier drilling rig was not brought into Kazakhstan.
(CPHB 2 {{f 228 — 232). Respondent argues that Claimants would have needed to
remove old rig, move the new rig in, assemble the new rig, and drill to 6000m in 3
months. Even if they had a new rig, it is unrealistic that a discovery would have
been made. Not even Claimants foresaw it would go so quickly, having submitted
a working program on 14 October 2008 that foresaw 7 months to drill Munaibay-1
from 5200 — 6000m. RPHB {[ 119; fn. 209).

1373.On 14 January 2009, the Fitch Ratings agency issued a Rating Watch Negative
report for Tristan’s long-term default rate. A Dow Jones release indicated that the
Rating Watch Negative report reflected Fitch's concern of “a potential negative
impact relating to the latest actions of the Kazakh authorities on Tristan's financial
standing and business prospects.” The Dow Jones report referenced KPM being
“subject to a criminal investigation.” (CPHB 1 {{{[ 219, 349; CPHB 2 {fj 38, 117; C-
590). Although Respondent has argued that the Tristan Notes were risky from the
outset, the Tribunal considers that the evidence reflects that Respondent’s actions
worsened the market’s treatment of these notes, and this was explicitly noted by the
ratings agencies.

1374.On 15 January 2009, Moody’s reported a downgrade review of Tristan, as a result
of the criminal investigation of KPM and the pre-emptive right claim concerning
TNG. (CPHB 2 {{f 38, 117; C-744).

1375.On 18 February 2009, Moody’s downgraded the Tristan debt from B2 to B3 due to
the “amplified regulatory and operational risk” posed by the unresolved criminal
investigation of KPM and the pre-emptive right claimed by the State against TNG.
(C-744).

1376.On 24 February 2009, the Financial Police seized KPM’s corporate documents.
(C-609).

1377.On 24 February 2009, TNG complained to MEMR regarding the negative effects
that the December 2008 publication of Respondent’s actions had had on its
business and reputation. (CPHB 2 {[ 117; R-II] 171; C-619).

1378.On 27 February 2009, the State responded to TNG’s objections to the 18 December
2008 notice, stating that the transfer of TNG to Terra Raf had breached the State’s
statutory pre-emptive right to acquire TNG. The State explained that TNG was,
therefore, in breach of Contracts 210 and 302. The State demanded that TNG
submit a new application for Kazakhstan's consent to the transfer and waiver of the
State’s pre-emptive purchase right. Failure to do so would result in termination of
TNG’s Subsoil Use Contracts. (C-0 {| 28, partially quoted; C-I {| 148; CPHB 2 {i
38, 117; C-146).

1379.On 3 and 4 March 2009, the Financial Police seized KPM’s and TNG’s corporate
documents. (C-610; C-611; C-612).

1380.On 5 March 2009, Moody’s downgraded the Tristan debt again, based on the
worsening treatment of KPM and TNG by Kazakhstan and, in particular, the
opening of a formal criminal investigation against TNG. (CPHB 2 {{ 38; C-744).

1381.In a hand-delivered letter dated 18 March 2009, which Respondent states should be
viewed as an attempt to provoke the Republic, TNG responded to the State’s 27
February 2009 notice of breach and offered the State three alternatives: (1)
revocation of the notice that purported to “reverse” the State’s February 2007
decision; (2) TNG’s reapplication for a transfer permit, if the State would agree to
pay USD 1.347 billion in compensation if the permit were denied, or (3) referral of
the dispute to the Arbitration Institute of the SCC and maintenance of TNG’s status
quo rights under the TNG Subsoil Use Contracts, pending a final arbitral decision.
(C-0 {| 29; C-I JJ 38, 149; CPHB 2 {{ 117; R-I {fff 9.75 — 9.76; C-41, WS Pisica 1 {[

1382.On 19 March 2009, the day after this correspondence from TNG to MEMR, a
group of representatives from KPM, TNG, Terra Raf, and Ascom met with the
MEMR Executive Secretary, Mr. A. B. Batalov, at the offices of the MEMR. At
this meeting, the State's actions against the Claimants since President Nazarbayev's
14/16 October 2008 Order were discussed. The Parties dispute whether Mr.
Batalov assured the Claimants that all of these issues would be disposed of in
favour of TNG and KPM, and that TNG's Subsoil Use Contracts would not be
cancelled, if TNG would simply submit a new application for its transfer to Terra

Page 300 of 414

Raf, and would permit the State to re-evaluate its prior consent. Mr. Batalov stated
that, because the size and value of TNG had changed since the 2003 transfer to
Terra Raf, the State would require a new and contemporary evaluation of TNG's
books and assets (as of February 2007) in order to properly re-evaluate the transfer.
KMG would conduct this new evaluation. Minutes of the meeting were prepared
by Mr. Grigore Pisica and were offered to Mr. Batalov for his signature, but he
refused to sign. (C-I {J 106, 150, 152, 177; R-I {| 13.47(e)(v), 21.1; C-42; C-111;
Lungu 43 — 45; Pisica {| 32 — 37, 43).

1383.On 24 March 2009, KPM and TNG sent a complaint to President Nazarbayev.
(CPHB 2 {{ 142; C-631).

1384.On 24 March 2009, following the meeting with Mr. Batalov of the MEMR, TNG
applied for a permit for the transfer of TNG's ownership to Terra Raf and for a
written decision on the State's waiver of its pre-emptive rights. (C-0 {[ 32, partially
quoted; C-I {ff 153, 332; C-147; Lungu {[ 46; Pisica {[ 38).

1385.On 25 March 2009, TNG sent the State a separate request for another formal,
written decision regarding the right of TNG to transfer Terra Raf's ownership
interests to a prospective third party buyer, including KMG, based upon a
competitive bidding process and direct negotiations (C-0 {{ 32, partially quoted; C-I
QM 153, 154, 332; C-148; Pisica { 38; Lungu { 46).

1386.On 30 March 2009, Contract 302 expired. (R-II { 411; C-53).

1387.On 2 April 2009, the Expert Commission passed a Decision, which recommended
the extension of Contract 302 for two years. (CPHB | {{ 236; CPHB 2 { 151; R-I'{
31.70; R-163.2).

1388.On 9 April 2009, the MEMR issued a written statement to execute the extension of
Contract 302 to 30 March 2011, which the Claimants allege that they requested on
9 March 2009, and which the Respondent states was requested on 24 March 2009.
The Claimants allege that the MEMR notified TNG of its agreement to extend
Contract 302 and undertook to execute the amendment by 2 July 2009.
Respondent states that the adopted decision has the character of a recommendation
and is only one of many legal actions required for a valid contract extension
including, for example, that TNG needed to apply for a license renewal, as well.
(C-0 58; C-I 99] 22, 178; R-I {J 31.71 — 31.73; C-II J 241; CPHB 2 {[ 151; R-II {il

Ongarbaev {[ 7.2; Ongarbaev Day 6 pp. 67 — 68).{|

1389. Despite these potentially promising developments of 2 and 9 April 2009, which
indicated that an extension may be forthcoming, the MEMR never renewed
Contract 302. This matter lingered over the following months, during which time,
TNG occasionally followed up — on 30 April 2009 and on 4 May 2009 — and
received hints that the renewal would be forthcoming. As a result of the State's
inaction, however, following the expiration of Contract 302 on 30 March 2009,
TNG was prevented from exercising its contractual rights under Contract 302 and,
therefore, prevented from further exploration of the Tabyl Block. The East
Munaibay discovery, first claimed by TNG in July 2008 and later further re-

notified to the MEMR on 9 March 2009, along with a further notice of discovery in
the Bahyt structure, remained unfulfilled.

On 25 April 2009, the Financial Police arrested Mr. Cornegruta. (C-I {[ 44,
partially quoted; R-I 27.2; C-117; Exhibit 1 and 3 to Rakhimov 2).

On 30 April 2009, the Financial Police issued attachment orders in respect of
KPM's and TNG's Subsoil Use Contracts. The Claimants allege that the Financial
Police issued no fewer than 10 orders for the sequestration of property, which
resulted in freezing KPM's and TNG's shares, KPM's Contract 305, TNG's
Contracts 210 and 302, KPM's field oil pipeline, TNG's field gas pipeline, TNG's
condensate pipeline, and the companies' other property. (C-I { 121; R-I[ 29.2;
486; C-487; C-488; C-489; C-490; C-491; C-492; C-493; C-494; C-495; C-496; C-
497; C-498; C-499; C-500; Condorachi {[ 38). Those orders prevented KPM and
TNG from selling or depreciating the value of those assets. (C-I { 121; CPHB | {|
140).

 

On 30 April 2009 and 4 May 2009, TNG followed up with the MEMR to inquire
about the status of the Contract 302 extension.

On 7 May 2009, Anatolie Stati wrote to President Nazarbayev to obtain the release
of Mr. Cornegruta, to protect the former and current management of KPM and
TNG, and to end the dispute. Around this date, Mr. Stati decided to pause
construction on the LPG Plant and to reduce planned development efforts at
Tolkyn and Borankol.

On 15 May 2009, the Financial Police issued attachment orders in respect of
KPM’s and TNG’s Subsoil Use Contracts and requested additional documents
from KPM. (R-I {| 29.2; CPHB 2 {] 38).

On 15 May 2009, the Financial Police notified KPM and TNG that they had seized
the Claimants' equity interests in KPM and TNG two days before on 13 May 2009.
The asset and equity seizures were designed to prevent KPM and TNG from selling
or transferring their interests during the course of the criminal proceeding against
Mr. Cornegruta. (C-I { 121). In addition, the Financial Police requested additional
documents from KPM. (C-668 and C-485). Respondent states that the Financial
Police issued attachment orders. (R-I {[ 29.2). Respondent does not admit that the
Financial Police notified KPM and TNG that it had seized KPM’s and TNG’s
equity interests on 13 May 2009. If the allegation is that Claimants were prevented
from transferring their interests during proceedings, then that would be appropriate
under the circumstances. (R-I {[ 26.26(c)).

On 12 June 2009, Terra Raf and Ascom filed petitions to lift the seizures. (C-0
45; C-I {| 122).

On 15 June 2009, Kazakhstan indicted Mr. Cornegruta. (C-454).

By early summer of 2009, most of the senior management of KPM and TNG, in
light of the case of Mr. Cornegruta, had fled Kazakhstan in order to avoid arrest.
The assets of KPM and TNG were under seizure. Credit Suisse had refused to
provide financing, and the companies urgently needed to renew financing

arrangements in order to meet their tax and interest obligations. It was against this
setting that the Laren Loan Facility was negotiated. (CPHB 2 {{ 213).

1399.On 16 June 2009, Claimants entered into the Laren Loan Facility, described in
detail in the summaries of the Parties’ positions, above.

1400. On 17 June 2009, the Financial Police publically announced that their investigative
phase had concluded and that the four former and current managers of KPM and
TNG would be prosecuted for having realized an “illegal profit” of 147 billion
Tenge (approximately USD 980 million as of June 2009). (C-0 {| 45, C-II {| 602;
CPHB 2 { 38 (calling the 147 billion the potential fine); R-I | 26.24; C-118).

1401.On 19 June 2009, the third tranche of the 2006 Bonds Project was issued, for USD
111.11 million. (R-I J 9.59).

1402.On 27 June 2009, the Terra Raf and Ascom petitions to lift the seizures were
denied. (C-0 45; C-I] 122).

1403.On 27 June 2009, the Regional Prosecutor’s Office wrote to Ascom and Terra Raf
noting that an international search was underway for Mr. Cojin. (CPHB 2 {[ 38;
RPHB 2 { 191).

1404.On 2 July 2009, the MEMR's self-imposed deadline to extend Contract 302
expired, without an extension of that contract. (CPHB 2 {ff 38, 151).

1405.On 10 July 2009, a Fitch Ratings press release indicated that market observers were
concerned about “weak corporate governance standards at Tristan.” (RPHB 2 4
61).

1406.In August 2009, Kazakhstan, the Governor of the Mangystau Region, KazAzot,
and Mitsubishi confirmed their intention to go forward with the ammonia-
carbamide complex. A few days after that announcement, on 26 August 2009, the
Governor of the Mangystau Region asked Prime Minister Massimov to cancel
TNG's and KPM's Subsoil Use Contracts. Claimants allege that this letter
implicitly sought the transfer of TNG's assets to KazAzot. (C-I { 61; C-293).

1407. Notwithstanding several attempts to obtain his release, Mr. Cornegruta remained
incarcerated until the conclusion of “his trial” on 18 September 2009. Thereafter,
following his conviction and sentence of four years, he remained in jail until he
escaped.

1408. From the above chain of events, the Tribunal considers that Respondent’s series of
actions starting in October 2008, which are breaches of the FET standard of the
ECT as found above in this Award and which were publicized beginning in
December 2008, harmed Claimants’ investments and prevented Claimants from
proceeding with their investment from that moment, forward.

1409.This affected Claimants’ search for bridge financing, which they began in
November 2008 on recommendation from Renaissance Capital. Bridge financing,
they state, was necessary at that time in order to obtain a partial advance on the

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 304 of 415
Page 303 of 414

proceeds of the sale in order to reinvest them into other projects as soon as possible
and, as Mr. Lungu explained, to protect against falling oil and gas prices.

1410. Thereafter, the 15 December 2008 formal initiation of the criminal investigation
against KPM and the 18 December 2008 INTERFAX publication, which
extensively quoted the MEMR’s accusations of forgery and violations of
registration requirements, had a profoundly negative impact on Claimants’
reputation and the value ascribed to their investments in capital markets. This
impact is easily understandable and obvious to the Tribunal. It is confirmed by the
fact that, on 14 January 2009, the Fitch ratings agency placed Tristan’s long-term
default rating and senior unsecured rating of B+ on the Rating Watch Negative.

1411.In this context, Respondent’s argument that the INTERFAX item cannot be
attributed to the Republic as it was not issued by the Republic and INTERFAX
obtained the information from unofficial sources, does not change the impact. Even
if Claimants have not shown that the Republic was in any way involved in the
publication of the INTERFAX item, it is obvious and not disputed by Respondent,
that it was Respondent’s actions starting in October 2008 that caused the
publication.

1412. As well, Respondent’s argument that, at the Hearing, Mr. Cojin testified that the
inspections and investigations “could not disturb” the people at TNG who were
“very busy with production,” does not change the negative impact of Respondent’s
chain of actions, as that impact is by no means limited to keeping the staff of
Claimants from engaging in more work on their normal business.

1413.Further, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent’s argument that Claimants
have not proven that the MEMR’s actions caused the Credit Suisse loan to fall
through. Moody’s and Fitch confirmed that the MEMR’s actions against KPM and
TNG raised concerns about the companies’ ability to service their existing debt.
The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that it would have been surprising if any
lender would have gone forward with the new financing without resolution of
Claimants’ conflicts with the government of Kazakhstan.

1414. It is apparent that, even before the trial of Mr. Cornegruta, the relentless onslaught
of inspections and, eventually, charges against KPM's most senior officer had,
when considered together with these pre-trial seizures of assets on 30 April 2009,
seriously disabled Claimants’ companies.

1415.The Parties agree, and the Tribunal also agrees, that Claimants were only able to
weather the liquidity storm of summer 2009 by obtaining financing through the
Laren Loan Facility. (RPHB 1 {[ 58, CPHB 2 {[ 257). The Parties agree, and the
Tribunal also agrees, that the terms of the Laren Facility were terrible for
Claimants. (CPHB 2 {{ 213; RPHB | { 60; RPHB 2 { 69(e)). Likewise, the Parties
agree, and the Tribunal also agrees, that had Claimants obtained financing from
Credit Suisse in December 2008, they would not have needed to resort to other
lenders in June 2009. (CPHB 1 {[ 353; RPHB 2 {{ 102; 961).

1416. What the Parties dispute is whether Respondent’s actions caused Claimants to enter
into the Laren Facility. The Tribunal finds that the Laren Facility, with its onerous
terms, was arranged in June 2009 because it was necessary for KPM and TNG to

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 305 of 415
Page 304 of 414

secure these funds and because Respondent’s actions prevented them from doing
so sooner. By June 2009, ordinary lenders would not lend to these companies on
commercial terms. Although Claimants drove the best bargain they could, the
cumulative effect of the barrage of inspections and the very public revelation in
December 2008 of the alleged forgery and fraud said to have been committed in
relation to the transfer to Terra Raf, as indicated above, led to the severe
downgrades by Moody’s and Fitch rating agencies. While the worldwide
economic crisis was affecting these companies in late 2008 and early 2009, the
State’s aggressive and concerted actions, including the inspections, the criminal
charges, and the asset seizures - even before Mr. Cornegruta’s trial in August and
September 2009 — forced Claimants to accept the “horrendous” Laren Facility.

1417.Furthermore, the Tribunal also notes that, despite TNG’s apparent attempts to
comply with Kazakhstan’s requests, the State never responded to TNG’s
applications of 24 and 25 March 2009 — applications that the State requested. As a
result, Kazakhstan’s alleged pre-emptive rights claim lingered throughout the
following two year period. It was, no doubt, a cloud on Terra Raf’s ownership
rights which created continuing difficulties for Claimants.

1418. The Claimants have also alleged that the inspections commencing in October 2008
interfered with their sales and marketing of gas. The Claimants argue that the
evident relationships between President Nazarbayev and his son-in-law are reason
enough to believe that the Kazakh State was the cause of the various difficulties
they encountered in securing their gas sales and export rights commencing in the
fall of 2008 and continuing into 2009. They point to the close relationships said to
exist between KMG, under the chairmanship of Mr. Kulibayev, and the KazAzot
resistance to signing the Tripartite Agreement after over two years of negotiations
and the signature of the other two parties to the agreement. They also point to their
difficulties with Kemikal, and its failure, at the critical time in the fall of 2008, to
continue supplying bank guarantees to secure payment of its accounts. The
Tribunal notes Respondent’s argument that the loss of Kemikal as a customer is not
attributable to the Respondent since that was due to liquidity issues of its own, and
that Kemikal is a private company that was not acting in any kind of governmental
capacity. However, Kemikal’s sudden refusal to post bank guarantees that were
required by its credit terms was a change of its earlier business pattern for which
the Tribunal sees no other convincing explanation than that it was part of
Respondent’s aggressive actions against the Claimants, irrespective of whether in
that context the fact that Kemikal was controlled by President Nazarbayev’s son-
in-law, Mr. Kulibayev, played a role.

1419. The Tribunal notes in the present context the Parties’ dispute whether the actions of
the Kazakh State prevented the owners of KMP and TNG from selling their
investments. The Claimants were persistent in their pursuit of selling KPM and
TNG, with or without Contract 302. In order to consider any possible contribution
to relevant causation, the following paragraphs highlight in a summary fashion the
additional events which surround the Claimants’ on-going efforts to sell KMP and
TNG and the impact of the State’s actions on those efforts.

1420.In the early summer 2008, Claimants decided that they wished to explore selling
KPM, the LPG Plant, and TNG, excepting its Contract 302 properties (the Tabyl

Block). This activity was called Project Zenith. The Claimants engaged the
services of Renaissance Capital to assist them.

On 18 July 2008, Renaissance sent a preliminary “teaser” invitation to 129
potentially interested buyers, including KMG. In mid-August 2008, Renaissance
distributed the Information Memorandum to 41 parties that had expressed interest
in these companies and their properties and had signed confidentiality agreements.
KMG was one of those companies.

On 29 August 2008, KPMG issued a complete Vendor Due Diligence presentation
for Project Zenith.

By 1 October 2008, Claimants had received 8 non-binding indicative bids from
various entities, including from KMG EP in the amount of USD 754 million and
from KNOC in the amount of USD 1.55 billion. The average of the 8 indicative
offers was USD 1.05 billion.

On 30 April 2009, however, the Financial Police obtained a pre-trial order for the
sequestration and arrest of all the shares of both KPM and TNG (C-486; C-487; C-
488; and C-489). By their terms, these orders not only sequestered these shares, but
also stated that all interested persons should be informed. The subsequent Minutes
of 13 May 2009 stated, among other things, that 100% of the share ownership in
the “statutory capital” of KPM and TNG had been sequestered and that, “Ir is
prohibited to carry out any actions related to the alienation or transfer of the
sequestered property (100% share ownership in the statutory capital) to third
parties.”

In addition to these difficulties, the Claimants were faced with on-going taxation
claims by the State, as well as the State's efforts to collect on the judgement made
by the court against KPM. On 18 September 2009, in addition to a 4-year prison
term for Mr. Cornegruta, the criminal court ordered KPM to pay 21,675,578.00
Tenge (approximately USD 145,475,534.08) to the Kazakhstan state budget. On 30
September 2009, the Financial Police ordered the Aktau territorial customs body to
conduct a new audit of KPM based on its failure to pay the Crude Oil Export Tax
for its January 2009 exports. By December 2009, following a number of court
procedures, the Specialized Interdistrict Economic Court issued a consolidation
decision, rejecting KPM's and TNG's challenges to corporate back taxes. At the
same time, the Financial Police pursued interrogations of KPM employees with
respect to a potential tax assessment in relation to 2008 export taxes. In early 2010,
KPM commenced a new action to challenge the Financial Police's claim that it
owed 2008 export taxes on oil exports. On 31 March 2010, after having paid
significant sums in relation to export taxes, KPM and TNG were successful before
the Central Customs Committee which notified them that pursuant to their subsoil
use contracts, they were not liable for export taxes from October 2008.

A myriad of enforcement actions ensued. On 29 December 2009, the Aktau City
Court issued a writ of execution against KPM for the execution of the criminal
courts' order to pay the fine of approximately USD 145 million. In early 2010, the
Aktau Division of the Enforcement Officers of the Mangystau Oblast issued a
Decree on Initiating of the Enforcement Proceedings against KPM for the
Recovery of Revenue for the amount of USD 145 million. Enforcement measures

followed this decree from January to June 2010, including seizures of various bank
accounts on 10 January 2010, seizure and impounding of motor vehicles on 22
January 2009, a further order on 25 January 2010 of the Mangystau Oblast court
with respect to the outstanding Writ of Execution for the payment of 21.6 billion
Tenge, together with various additional audits to determine the particulars of
remaining assets. By 3 February 2010, the Ministry of Finance notified KPM that it
was being monitored for bankruptcy (as of 26 January 2010) for the sum of 3.8
billion Tenge, including interest relating to alleged back taxes and penalties for
corporate taxes. On 19 February 2010, the Chief of the Aktau Territorial
Department issued a further writ of execution while noting that previous collection
orders had gone unfulfilled. This particular order (actually received on | March
2010) attached some 2,186 assets previously listed in the detailed inventory. On 23
February this same official issued a further order prohibiting KPM from executing
import and export formalities regarding the transportation of oil. On 26 February
2010, this same official dismissed KPM's challenge to the writ of enforcement and
issued an order “to attach the oil pipeline from [the] OTP to Opornaya CRMB
[Commoditiies and Raw Material Base of Opornaya Station] of 18 kilometers” and
KPM's accumulator oil tanks. This order also prohibited KPM from transferring oil
to the main pipeline operated by KazTransOil once its accumulator tanks reached
their capacity. Later, on 4 March 2010, the Chief of the Aktau Territorial
Department, despite attachment of numerous accounts and assets, complained that
these efforts had not so far been successful and, accordingly, he wished to change
course by seeking an enforcement procedure to in-kind transfers of land lots, the
18km pipeline, KPM's Contract 305 over the Borankol field and KPM's subsoil use
license No. 309. By 17 March 2010, the Acting Head of the Aktau Territorial
Department of Judicial Executors relented and agreed with KPM to suspend the
effect of the previous orders made on 23 and 26 February 2010 in order to avoid
the suspension of production activity by KPM.

1427.In the meantime, in October, 2009, Starleigh had presented an initial bid of USD
450 million for Claimants’ properties in Kazakhstan. Later, in November 2009,
Starleigh reduced this bid by USD 100 million, ostensibly in recognition of the
USD 145 million fine that had been imposed on KPM by the criminal court.
Around this same time, KMG NC began to pursue a possible purchase of the
Claimants' assets. At a meeting in Amsterdam in November 2009, the Claimants
received an offer from KMG NC of USD 20 million for their equity interests in
their companies (immediately following a meeting between KMG NC and
representatives of certain of the noteholders in which they were supposedly offered
25 cents on the dollar for their notes). Subsequently, Starleigh made a further offer
of USD 50 million on the assumption they could buy out the noteholders. Grand
Petroleum offered to purchase KPM and TNG for USD 1.15 billion.

1428.On 13 February 2010, the Claimants successfully negotiated the sale of 100% of
their shares and participatory interests in KPM and TNG to Cliffson Company S.A.
The total value of that agreement, including buying out the companies' noteholders
(including the purchase of Tristam), payment for the Claimants’ equity interests,
and assumption of liabilities was in the order of USD 920 to 930 million.
Claimants say this was a reduced value for their assets in view of the impact of the
criminal judgement and its enforcement against KPM. One condition of this
potential sale was that the MOG would grant permission for the sale and waive the
State's alleged pre-emptive right to purchase KPM and TNG. The MOG conditions

for approval of this potential sale included removal of the attachment orders as well
as assurances concerning the financial solvency and technical and managerial
capabilities of the Cliffson Company. The Respondent says it co-operated with the
Claimants on this matter while the Claimants say that Kazakhstan did not co-
operate.

On 30 April 2010, the MOG responded to the Claimant's application, dated 12
April 2010, for approval of the intended sale of their assets to Cliffson Company.
The MOG requested additional information regarding the terms of the proposed
transaction, but more importantly, noted Kazakhstan's previous seizures of the
companies’ assets and stated that transfers of the shares of KPM and TNG were
forbidden. The MOG stated that, as a result, the transaction would only be
approved if KPM and TNG satisfied the requirements necessary to release the
attachment of their shares.

On 6 May 2010, the Cliffson Company signed an amendment to the SPA to extend
the time for completing the transaction. On 1 June 2010 the MOG renewed its
request for further information in relation to the Cliffson Company transaction. By
9 June 2010, however, the Court Execution Body of the Mangystau Region — the
Acting Chief of Aktau Territorial Department of Judicial Executors - ordered the
sale of KPM's assets as a single lot, so as to avoid any suspension of activities.

On 15 June 2010, the Claimants wrote to Cliffson Company to express their
concern that it was “backing out” of the proposed transaction. Shortly after, on 23
June 2010, the Claimants wrote to MOG in reply to MOG's earlier requests, on 30
April and 1 June, for further information in relation to the Cliffson Company
transaction. The Claimants subsequently learned that Cliffson Company had
submitted a letter to the MOG stating that it refused to purchase the interests in
TNG and KPM under their 13 February 2010 agreement.

It is the mandate of the Tribunal to decide on the Relief Sought by the Parties, no
less, but also no more. The Tribunal notes that Claimants, in their Relief Sought as
cited above in this Award, do not request a separate amount allegedly caused by
their prevention from selling the investment, but rather base their amounts
requested on alleged violations related to the Borankol and Tolkyn Fields and
Munaibay Oil, to the Contract 302 Properties, and to the LPG Plant. Therefore, the
Tribunal hereafter will focus on these claims and considers that it does not have to
decide whether Respondent’s actions prevented Claimants from selling their
investments, unless this issue may become relevant for one of the claims raised.
This will be taken into account in the Tribunal’s examination of the respective
claims hereafter.

KI. Whether Claimants’ Alleged Inexperience and
Own Actions Led to the Demise of KPM and
TNG (Intervening Cause)

1. Arguments by Claimants

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 309 of 415
Page 308 of 414

1433.When the State argues that injury resulted from acts of the victim or the market,
rather than its own wrongful acts, the burden is on the State to prove such an
intervening cause. Respondent has not met that burden. Respondent argues that
the Tristan debt structure, the financial crisis, the drop in oil prices, and the
“constant withdrawal of cash from the companies” led to “a severe underfunding of
KPM and TNG and subsequently, to the companies no longer complying with their
obligations under the Subsoil Use Contracts and Kazakh law. The eventual
termination of the contracts was a logical consequence.” While KPM and TNG
experienced a short-term liquidity shortage in the first half of 2009, that problem
was magnified by Kazakhstan’s actions and, in any event, did not lead to the failure
of the companies. There never were any lawful grounds for terminating the Subsoil
Use Contracts of KPM and TNG, or seizing their assets. Claimants never
abandoned their investments. (CPHB 2 {If 247 — 248).

1434. There is no credible evidence to support Respondent’s argument that KPM and
TNG were overleveraged prior to state action, and that that doomed them to fail
after oil prices dropped due to the financial crisis. This argument is belied by the
facts. Prior to 14 October 2008, KPM and TNG were neither insolvent nor
overleveraged. Prof. Olcott’s statement that the annual interest payment on the
Tristan notes caused continuous and negative financial impact on KPM and TNG’s
operations is not credible and she was not qualified to make the statement.
Likewise, Mr. Gruhn of Deloitte failed to perform any direct analysis of KPM and
TNG?’s abilities to service their debt. Deloitte’s argument concerning the trading
value of the Tristan notes indicated financial distress is rubbish. As Howard Rosen
of FTI explained, prior to the Lehman bankruptcy, Tristan notes were trading close
to their USD 100 face value (at USD 95). The day immediately following, the
trading price was USD 84.50 and the value steadily declined to around USD 65 on
14 October 2008. At the time, the markets were not trading on fundamentals, and
investors sold securities for a variety of reasons, including raising cash to meet
investor calls, to reduce risk, or simply due to panic. FTI analysed the finances of
KPM and TNG and concluded that they were in good financial condition prior to
October 2008, having respective current ratios of 3.1 and 3.0. (CPHB | {{ 399 —
404; CPHB 2 {if 249 — 253).

1435. Kazakhstan partly caused and greatly exacerbated the liquidity problem that KPM
and TNG experienced in 2009. When Kazakhstan argues that KPM and TNG only
had USD 9 million in cash on hand at the end of September 2008, they ignore that
they also held USD 22 million in inventory and USD 296 in trade receivables at
that time. In total, their net working capital was USD 222 million. That was a
solid cushion, and they were a very long way from insolvent. That the primary
assets were in receivables did not create a liquidity issue, since KPM and TNG
could use the prepayment provisions of the Vitol COMSA agreement as a
revolving line of credit to manage their cash flow requirements. (CPHB 2 {| 254 —
255).

1436. In the first half of 2009, a number of factors nonetheless combined to produce a
liquidity crunch, including (1) low prices and slow payments by customers, (2)
reduction in gas and condensate sales due to the non-renewal of the Kemikal
contract, and (3) Vitol’s decision to stop funding LPG Plant, and to reduce the
credit line under the prepayment terms of the COMSA agreements from USD 120
million to USD 40 million effective at the end of June 2009. As a result, Claimants

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 310 of 415
Page 309 of 414

sought the Credit Suisse Loan, in order to protect the company in the event that
prices should continue to decline. The decision to see bridge financing was not a
sign of financial distress. Nevertheless, the cash problem came to a head in June
2009 when 2 large payments became due — the USD 22 million payment on the
Tristan notes and an EPT of USD 25 million. The failure to make either of these
payments would have jeopardized KPM and TNG, and this forced Claimants to
seek out the Laren loan facility. (CPHB 2 {| 255 — 257).

1437.The market causes not attributable to Kazakhstan were temporary. The low oil
price environment was over by the fourth quarter of 2009. 2008 was an anomalous
year because oil climbed to unprecedented highs and shocking lows. The
companies average realized gas price declined only 14.2 percent from 2008 — 2009.
The 52.1% decline in the companies’ gas sale revenue was due to reduced sales
volumes, attributable to Kazakhstan’s conduct. The companies nonetheless
survived the temporary cash flow crisis and even continued paying employees.
Even with low oil prices, KPM and TNG did not record substantial losses - KPM
recorded a net loss of USD 13 million and TNG recorded a net profit of USD 9.4
million, after paying interest in Tristan debt. The companies were not
overleveraged. (CPHB | {{{ 409 — 415). But for the actions of Kazakhstan, they
would have been well positioned to rebound as oil prices climbed back toward
historic highs in the second half of 2010. (CPHB 2 {[{[ 258 — 261).

1438.The evidence shows that Claimants did not abandon their investments.
Kazakhstan’s argument that Claimants’ stripped KPM and TNG of cash in
preparation to abandon them is unsupported and wrong. KPM paid dividends in
2009 and 2010 to avoid seizure of the funds — not to prepare for voluntary
abandonment. It was apparent that any money flowing into KPM’s bank accounts
was at risk to satisfy the USD 145 penalty illegal imposed on KPM on 18
September 2009. Further, allowing Tristan to collect funds that would otherwise
have been frozen in KPM’s bank accounts was reasonable. Tristan noteholders did
not place Tristan in default based on those payments, indicating that the
noteholders were satisfied with the steps that Claimants took to enable that coupon
payment. Tristan Oil’s payment of a USD 3.86 million bonus to Anatolie Stati is a
non-issue, as he has a right to receive the profits of his investment. The payment
did not exacerbate any liquidity problems at the end of 2009, because there were
none. (CPHB | {| 416 — 422; CPHB 2 {| 262 — 264).

1439.The declaration of dividends was a reasonable effort to mitigate harm caused by
Kazakhstan’s actions. The assignment of receivables allowed Tristan to collect
funds that otherwise may have been frozen and allowed Tristan to make the USD
28 million coupon payment in full. It prevented Tristan’s default on the notes.
(CPHB 2 {[ 264).

1440. Claimants dispute Respondent’s assertion that KPM and TNG had not collected
USD 170 million in receivables from Montvale, because it invested funds from
Vitol in certain non-liquid assets. In any event, this does not show that KPM and
TNG’s failure to collect receivables was part of a preparation to abandon the
companies. (CPHB 2 {[ 265).

1441.The evidence demonstrates that Claimants went to great lengths to protect their
investments. The assignment of receivables prevented a default on the Tristan

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 311 of 415

Page 310 of 414

notes. Claimants went to great lengths to pay KPM’s employees after its accounts
were frozen in 2010 by having TNG pay those employees from its accounts. The
Laren loan was secured by a personal guarantee from Anatolie Stati and a pledge
from Ascom of its assets in Iraq, and was necessary to keep the companies alive.
Thus, Claimants made every effort to protect their assets, right up to seizure in July
2010. (CPHB 2 { 266).

2. Arguments by Respondent

1442.KPM and TNG’s demise, which was unrelated to Respondent and was related to
self-inflicted and external financial stress, ultimately led to the breaches of the
Subsoil Use Contracts and to the termination of those contracts and the invocation
of the trust regime. In particular:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

7)

(g)

Claimants mismanaged their assets on numerous occasions, for example
by putting alarmingly incompetent personnel in charge of important tasks
and by promising sales to business partners that they could have never
made. The mismanagement went so far that market observers were
concerned about “weak corporate governance standards at Tristan”. The
overall level of mismanagement comes as no surprise given that Claimants
had no prior experience in oil and gas production and in the Kazakh or
international markets.

KPM’s and TNG’s business was very risky from the start, as was set out
clearly in the Tristan note prospectus.

KPM’s and TNG’s financing structure, which aimed at removing capital

from the companies, made them vulnerable to situations of crisis

Claimants took business decisions aimed only at short-term profit. In
particular the ramping up of production at the end of 2007 was short
sighted, as it led to a loss of available gas production for the LPG Plant
and the allegedly expected possibility of gas export (which the Republic
denies).

In April of 2008, Claimants found out that their estimates for production

from Borankol had been overstated by 300%. At the time, Claimants

received the new Miller&Lents reserves report which set out 2P reserves
of 24.6 MMboe. The earlier report by Ryder Scott had provided for 2P
reserves of 72.4 MMboe. The effect of this loss was particular significant
because Borankol is a predominantly oil producing field and oil
production is much more valuable than gas production.

KPM and TNG were already in severe financial difficulties as of
Claimants’ valuation date, as is evidenced by the development of the
Tristan notes price.

Severe drops in energy prices and in demand, in particular due to the loss
of Kemikal as a customer, led to a very restricted cash position for KPM
and TNG. At the same time, the need for capital expenditure increased
markedly, putting further pressure on the companies.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 312 of 415
Page 311 of 414

(h) Against this background, when uncontestedly legal tax demands were
raised by the state in the summer of 2009, Claimants had to take out the
horrendous Laren loan and issue new notes in the amount of USD 111.1
million in connection thereto.

(i) Thereafter, Claimants deliberately chose to withdraw cash from KPM and
TNG, all while not fulfilling the annual work programs. This was
effectively the deliberate abandonment of the companies. (R-II { 440;
RPHB 2 {] 60-61).

1443.KPM and TNG were in poor financial health prior to Claimants’ valuation date.
Importantly, the Tristan note trading price stood at USD 65.125 for a nominal
value of USD 100, translating to a yield to maturity of 26.319%, indicating that the
markets expected a default. While Claimants try to attribute this to the Lehman
bankruptcy, that statement is misleading. At the same time, oil and gas prices
strongly decreased, putting additional pressures on the companies’ revenues and
the market’s risk perception made it difficult to obtain financing. Additional key
financial figures indicate that KPM’s and TNG’s financial figures deteriorated
prior to 14 October 2008, including their current ratios, (which decreased from
5.74 at year end 2007 to 3.06 on 30 June 2008), for example. (RPHB 2 {{[ 62 —
68).

1444. The PWC Due Diligence also confirmed that external circumstances were to
blame for the demise of KPM and TNG. PwC found that the decline in condensate
prices and the decline in oil prices were the key reasons for falling sales and
profitability of TNG and KPM, respectively. The loss of Kemikal as a customer —
which, contrary to Claimants’ invention, was due to Kemikal’s insolvency issues
and not state action — also resulted in a drop in demand for Claimants’ goods.
Claimants’ liquidity was further exacerbated by KPM and TNG’s decision to have
Montvale (the intermediary between KPM, TNG, and Vitol) invest USD 170
million from Vitol in non-liquid assets, rather than make payments on KPM and
TNG’s receivables. (RPHB 2 § 69).

1445.These cash constraints caused KPM and TNG to stop their capital investment
programs, putting them in breach of their annual work programs and causing them
to stop the LPG Plant project. Thus, that work stoppage cannot be attributed to
Respondent. An additional consequence of these cash constraints was the
infamous Laren loan and the corresponding issuance of USD 11.1 million in new
Tristan notes. (RPHB 2 { 70).

1446. Regarding Claimants’ criticisms of the PwC Due Diligence Report, Claimants
could have objected to its introduction or have asked for an opportunity to produce
counter evidence — they did not. PwC prepared a financial due diligence report that
did not assess the legality of any state action, as that was beyond the scope of the
report. PwC assessed all circumstances that could affect the financial situation,
caused lawfully or unlawfully. (RPHB 2 {71 — 72).

1447. Claimants’ contention that the auditor’s going concern qualification in the Interim
Report shows that the Republic’s actions caused injury to Claimants is not true.
Instead, the qualification demonstrates the severity of Claimants’ situation due to
the uncontestedly lawful tax claims (EPT which have never been objected to by

KPM or TNG), the non-payment of which led to the freezing of KPM and TNG’s
accounts and the Montvale payment issue. (RPHB 2 {| 73 — 76)

The oil price decline in 2008 and 2009 had a severe impact and was one of many
factors affecting KPM and TNG. The drop in demand persisted through 2009,
where Tolkyn was producing at 2005/2006 levels and then in 2010, when it
produced at 2002 levels. At the same time, Claimants own evidence from Miller &
Lents shows that Claimants needed an additional capital expenditure of USD 276.2
million to keep the estimated 2P production near the levels estimated in the 2008
Miller & Lents report. Thus, 2007 and 2009 are not comparable at all and 2009
was particularly volatile. Prices even dropped below USD 70/barrel in 2010.
Claimants’ argument that gas prices did not decline significantly is contradicted by
Anatolie Stati’s testimony. The objective evidence also shows that Anatolie Stati
was lying when he stated that gas prices had been going up from summer 2008 to
the beginning of 2009. (RPHB 2 {| 77 — 82).

Claimants effectively abandoned the companies in 2009 and 2010, stripping as
much cash from KPM and TNG as possible, issuing a USD 72 million dividend in
2009 and 2010 and transferring receivables to Ascom. These were paid in
violation of the Tristan note indenture. As a result, KPM had no cash inflow.
Claimants admit that they stripped the assets to avoid seizure by the State.
Claimants have not proven that any of the USD 72 million was used to repay
interest on the Tristan notes. Since the noteholders had not placed Tristan in
default at that time, Claimants had not obligation to pay the interest. Claimants
also suggested that the USD 72 million was used to repay Laren lenders and to
keep paying KPM’s employees, but this is also unproven. Finally, Claimants
extension of the payment terms for Stadoil and General Affinities further stripped
their assets. To date, Claimants have not clarified whether Stadoil or General
Affinities ever made payments on the trade receivables. Accordingly, the evidence
demonstrates that Claimants indeed abandoned KPM and TNG and only kept the
companies on life support in order to force the Republic to terminate the contracts,
so that Claimants could then advance these claims in arbitration. (RPHB 2 {J 83 —
90, 128).

Claimants likely siphoned off more moneys by extending the due date on accounts
receivables due from affiliated companies. Even the Tristan Oil Annual Report
(2009) mentions that Claimants would cancel delivery for equipment to the LPG
Plant, and then a third company, Perkwood Investments, would return the advance
paid. Claimants have provided no trace of this money (USD 36,800,212) and
likely pocketed it. Claimants would also divert cash to operating companies, such
as by paying Anatolie Stati’s CASCO double the market price to do work. There
were also opaque service agreements with Ascom. Likely, there are other
transactions, but Claimants’ opaque financing structure makes it impossible to see
those. FTI estimates that diverted monies could be as much as USD 226.6 million.
(R-III { 441; RPHB 1 {| 1038 — 1049; RPHB 2 { 17).

Assuming liability and causality, these financial difficulties have major
implications for the calculation of damages and the selection of a valuation date.

3. The Tribunal

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 314 of 415
Page 313 of 414

1452. As mentioned above, the Tribunal agrees with the Parties that

. as reflected in Art. 36 and 39 ILC Articles on State Responsibility,
Claimants bear the burden of demonstrating that the claimed quantum of
compensation is caused by the host State’s conduct,

. Article 39 ILC Articles requires that the Claimants’ conduct be taken into
account in determining compensation,

. the burden may shift to the state to prove that a factor attributable to the
victim or a third party caused the damage alleged, unless the injury can be
shown to be severable in causal terms from that attributed to the State.

1453. The Tribunal has considered Respondent’s arguments that KPM and TNG’s demise
was unrelated to Respondent and was caused by self-inflicted and external
financial stress, ultimately leading to the breaches of the Subsoil Use Contracts and
to the termination of those contracts and the invocation of the trust regime.
Respondent adds a number of examples to prove that. In that regard, the Tribunal
comes to the following conclusions.

1454. The evidence considered in the chapter above on the causation by Respondent’s
actions is so strong that, taking into account the above cited legal principles, the
Tribunal concludes that the burden of proof has shifted to Respondent to show that,
in spite of the causation by its own actions, Claimants caused or contributed in a
relevant way to the damages that incurred to Claimants’ investment. The
Respondent has not been able to provide sufficient proof in this regard.

1455. As Claimants concede, KPM and TNG experienced a short-term liquidity shortage
in the first half of 2009. But the Tribunal considers that this shortage was
magnified by Kazakhstan’s actions, and in any event did not lead to the failure of
the companies. There is no convincing evidence to that KPM and TNG were over-
leveraged prior to October 2008. The market causes not attributable to Kazakhstan
were temporary. The low oil price environment was over by the fourth quarter of
2009. 2008 was an anomalous year because oil climbed to unprecedented highs
and shocking lows. There is no convincing evidence that KPM and TNG would
have become insolvent after oil prices dropped due to the financial crisis.

1456. Weighing the evidence submitted by the Parties, the Tribunal is not persuaded by
the testimony of Prof. Olcott (who is not an economic expert) that the annual
interest payment on the Tristan notes caused continuous and negative financial
impact on KPM and TNG’s operations. As Mr. Gruhn of Deloitte did not perform
any direct analysis of KPM and TNG’s abilities to service their debt, the Tribunal
rather accepts FTI’s testimony that the finances of KPM and TNG were in good
financial condition prior to October 2008, having respective current ratios of 3.1
and 3.0.

1457.Respondent has also not provided sufficient evidence that Claimants abandoned
their investments. Rather, Claimants’ actions seem to have been caused by
Respondent’s measures. KPM paid dividends in 2009 and 2010 to avoid seizure of
the funds by Respondent. It was apparent that any money flowing into KPM’s bank
accounts would be at risk of being taken to satisfy the USD 145 penalty imposed

on KPM on 18 September 2009. Further, allowing Tristan to collect funds is also
understandable as these would otherwise have been been frozen in KPM’s bank
accounts. As well, the declaration of dividends, in the view of the Tribunal, seems
to have been a reasonable effort to mitigate harm caused by Respondent’s actions.
The assignment of receivables allowed Tristan to collect funds that otherwise may
have been frozen and allowed Tristan to make the USD 28 million coupon payment
in full. It prevented Tristan’s default on the notes.

In view of these considerations, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent has not
submitted sufficient evidence that Claimants’ inexperience or own actions caused
or contributed in a relevant way to the damages that occurred to Claimants’
investment.

L. uantum
LI. Preliminary Considerations
The Tribunal notes that Respondent has stated that its arguments made regarding

damages are without prejudice to its position on jurisdiction and liability and to its
position that no harassment campaign was ever started against Claimants. (R-II {[
15; R-I ff 34 et seq., 35 et seq., 47.2).

Though the Tribunal found above that Respondent’s primary breach of the ECT is
that of Art. 10(1) to provide FET, since that breach resulted finally in a taking of
Claimants’ investment, some guidance can be provided by Art. 13 on expropriation
regarding the date and measure for the calculation of damages. The second
paragraph of Art. 13(1) ECT deals with “compensation” for a lawful expropriation
and provides:

“Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the
Investment expropriated at the time immediately before the Expropriation
or impending Expropriation became known in such a way as to affect the
value of the Investment.” (herein referred to as the “Valuation Date”).

From this provision, the Tribunal takes guidance to the effect that the damages to
be awarded for what it has found above to be not a lawful expropriation, but rather
a breach of the ECT, shall not be lower than what the ECT prescribes for a lawful
expropriation.

LO. Valuation Date

1. Arguments by Claimants
The selection of the appropriate valuation date is critical for assessing damages and
awarding Claimants the full reparation as set out by the PCIJ in Chorzéw and as

codified in Art. 31 of the International Law Commission Draft Articles on
Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. (C-II {{[ 607 — 608).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 316 of 415
Page 315 of 414

1463. While the ECT provides that in cases of lawful expropriation, the State must pay
“prompt, adequate, and effective compensation” amounting to the FMV of the
investment at the time immediately prior to the expropriation, the ECT contains no
rules for the standard of compensation for expropriations or other actions
committed in violation of the ECT. Under customary international law on
quantum, the Tribunal should award full reparation for the harm resulting from the
state action. The FMV of the assets of KPM and TNG is the appropriate measure
of damages for all of Claimants’ claims, in light of the cumulative effect of
Kazakhstan’s numerous breaches of its obligations under the ECT. (CPHB 2 {ff
268 — 273).

1464.In order to re-establish the situation that existed before the wrongful acts,
Respondent must pay a sum that in the words of Chorzéw Factory, would “wipe
out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which
would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.” Here,
the act triggering or commencing the wrongful acts was the issuance of President
Nazarbayev’s 14 October 2008 order. The harassment campaign ensued
immediately thereafter. There is a causal link between the campaign launched on
14 October 2008 and the seizure on 21 July 2010 that justifies setting the valuation
date at the commencement of that campaign. Respondent has ignored the
continuing injury to Claimants, including the active reduction in value of the
properties and the impact that had on their efforts to sell the properties. (C-II {{f
210 et seg., 476 — 478, 580 — 583; 607 — 609; CPHB 2 {| 274 — 275).

1465. This principal of full compensation, with its corollary mandate for re-establishment
of the situation that existed before a state’s wrongful conduct, is equally at play in
the adjudication of indirect expropriation cases. Where a state’s conduct has
involved two or more instances of identifiable expropriative measures, the
selection of an early measure, even if less severe or direct than a later measure, will
assure both equity and full compensation for the State’s unlawful conduct. This
principle was at play in Sedco y. Iran. The Tribunal in Amoco International
Finance Corp. v. Iran also awarded the claimant compensation based on a date
earlier than the liability date, using the date that the claimant lost control over the
future management direction of the investments as the valuation date. The relevant
element for a loss of control was not the appointment of outside managers, but the
degree of interference by those managers with the owners’ property rights or
‘fundamental rights of ownership.’ While there were no temporary managers
appointed in this case, the State’s campaign deprived Claimants of their ability to
freely alienate their investments and their ability to freely manage their capital
expenditures for improvement of their investments. (C-II {{{[ 610 - 613).

1466. Claimants’ additional arguments are best taken form their own words:

615. — Where, as in the present case, there is a campaign of unlawful, interfering
measures by the State, with the commencement of that campaign being an
unfair and inequitable order that implements a deliberate strategy of
expropriation through conduct that indisputably violates multiple
standards of treaty protection, and the conclusion of that campaign being
direct expropriation, equity and full compensation fairly demand that the
intentional conmencement date of that campaign be chosen as the
valuation date. Equity and full compensation are not served by choosing

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 317 of 415
Page 316 of 414

the date of final seizure for valuation, or by granting Kazakhstan a grace
period between the date of its order to commence its expropriative
campaign and some arguable date thereafter when that campaign
ostensibly had its first measurable effects.

616. The Tribunal should accordingly adopt October 14, 2008 as the proper
valuation date, and assess the fair market value of Claimants’ investments
as of that date based upon the information then available to a willing
buyer.

1467.Professors Reisman and Sloane explain that, when considering an indirect
expropriation, Tribunals should distinguish the “moment of expropriation” from the
“moment of valuation.” If, for example, the moment of expropriation were to be
confused with the moment of valuation, a Tribunal would be unable to award full
compensation and would allow the wrongdoing state to benefit from its unlawful
conduct throughout the campaign of indirect expropriation. In effect, such a
Tribunal would reward the unlawful conduct. (C-I {{ 404 — 407). Claimants’
arguments against using 21 July 2010 as the valuation date are best taken from
their own words:

584. [...] Kazakhstan wants to pigeonhole Claimants’ case into a classic claim
of creeping expropriation under which alleged ownership-interfering
actions by the State eventually “ripen” along a continuum into a taking.
Misclassifving Claimants’ case in this way provides Kazakhstan with an
avenue to argue (unpersuasively) that no single action by the State during
the course of its harassment campaign amounted to a State seizure —
other than, of course, the State’s ultimate seizure of Claimants’ assets on
July 21, 2010, which Kazakhstan then claims must be the valuation date if
damages are to be awarded. Coupled with this argument is Kazakhstan’s
repeated and rote assertion that its harassment campaign was merely an
appropriate exercise of State regulatory power, and that it was neither an
intentional expropriative campaign nor executed in furtherance of a
conspiracy to expropriate. Thus, under this argument, any diminution in
the value or profitability of the assets to Claimants between October of
2008 and July of 2010 was not the fault of the State.

   

585. By this argument, Kazakhstan is effectively contending that Claimants must
itemize the loss caused by each discrete act in Kazakhstan’s harassment
campaign. [...] Claimants do not contend that each particular event in
Kazakhstan’s harassment campaign caused the entirety of Claimants’
losses. Rather, the combined effect of Kazakhstan's conduct caused
Claimants to lose control over their investments, deprived them of the
rights of s and free ty d with
ownership, and violated Claimants’ rights to have their investments treated
fairly and equitably and in accordance with the other substantive
standards of protection in the ECT. (C-II 1] 584 — 585).

1468. There is no mechanical formula for determining whether one or more State actions
amount to an indirect expropriation or a treaty violation. Here however, the
harassment campaign that was initiated on 14 October 2008 was designed to (i)
prevent Claimants from selling their properties to a third party, (ii) make normal
daily operations an effective impossibility, and (iii) create an extremely risky

investment environment to stop Claimants from continuing to make capital outlays
for develop of their investments. This | ign met its intended
purpose: to devalue and impair the investments. Professors Reisman and Sloane
would agree: where the intent to expropriate can be proven, the State’s intent to
expropriate should be given significant weight in the assessment of the proper
valuation date. The campaign was expropriatory and violated the ECT. (C-II {{{f
210 et seq., 586 — 603, 614 — 616).

The tribunals in CMS v. Argentina and Vivendi v. Argentina recognized that the
task of putting claimants into the position they would have occupied but for the
State’s wrongful conduct necessarily involves uncertainty. The tribunal must
consider how events far into the future may have developed but for the state’s
actions. As a result, and as confirmed by the annulment committee in Rumeli v.
Kazakhstan, tribunals have broad discretion in establishing the appropriate
quantum for compensation, and it is not a simple matter to be resolved on burden
of proof. Once the tribunal is satisfied that the claimant has suffered some damage
as a result of breach, the determination of damage is a matter of the tribunal’s
informed estimation. This is true for all of Kazakhstan’s violations of the ECT,
since they collectively led to the single injury of the impairment and taking of
Claimants’ investments. (CPHB 2 {{{ 270 — 272).

As confirmed by Mr. Rosen’s testimony at the Hearing on Quantum, the 14
October 2008 date is necessary to fully compensate Claimants for the injuries
caused by Kazakhstan’s violations of the ECT and international law. Respondent’s
valuation date does not account for any of the value-depressing effects of the
State’s actions, including the diminution in value caused by the allegations that the
State made against KPM and TNG or the effect of actions taken against Claimants’
reputation and ability to sell the investments free from state interference. 14
October 2008, or at least shortly thereafter, was the last day that Claimants had an
opportunity to sell their investments in an open and unrestricted market. (CPHB 1
I 426 — 430).

Claimants note that Respondent has made no mention of other possible dates — like
the 18 December 2008 reversal of the 20 February 2007 share transfer approval. In
Respondent’s effort to push the date forward all the way to 21 July 2010,
Respondent only globally describes some aspects of its harassment campaign and
summarily states that these could not have had any impact on operations or value
of Claimants’ assets. (C-II J 594).

In addition, on 14 October 2008, TNG notified MEMR of its intention to extend
the exploration in the Contract 302 by two years. (C-I J 175).

The 14 October 2008 valuation date would not give Claimants double
compensation, as asserted by Respondent. Claimants did not earn hundreds of
millions of dollars between the valuation dates. Deloitte never stated that KPM
and TNG earned anything at all between the valuation dates. Instead, Deloitte said
that production was assumed by FTI have a value of USD 226.6 million (later USD
302.3 million). Deloitte purports to calculate the amount that KPM and TNG
would have earned in between the valuation dates, but for the interference by
Kazakhstan. The amount that KPM and TNG could have earned but for
interference should not be deducted from the valuation because there was

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 319 of 415
Page 318 of 414

interference. KPM and TNG did not produce as much oil and gas as they could
have. Moreover, Kazakhstan impeded Claimants’ efforts to sell the companies.
Deducting this amount would improperly deny Claimants compensation for
injuries that Kazakhstan caused during that time. (CPHB | {{{[ 431 — 434).

1474. Regarding the distributions after 14 October 2008, KPM assigned USD 81.2
million in receivables to Tristan Oil and Ascom in the form of loan payments and
dividends in 2009. Not only did Claimants reinvest more than this in the
companies, those funds represented profits that KPM and TNG earned prior to 14
October 2008. At the end of September 2008, KPM and TNG combined had 221.5
million in net working capital and more than USD 367 in retained earnings on their
balance sheets. (CPHB 1 {{{[ 431, 435; CPHB 2 {[ 288).

1475.Furthermore, an award based on 14 October 2008 would not overcompensate
Claimants, since Claimants have not included working capital in their enterprise
valuation. Claimants request damages in the amount of assets that Kazakhstan
seized on the day it began its campaign to devalue and seize them. This is
equivalent to a hypothetical asset sale — i.e, what Kazakhstan would have had to
pay, had it purchased them on that date. Since Claimants have not included the
working capital that KPM and TNG subsequently distributed to Claimants, there is
no reason to reduce damages, since there is no double counting. (CPHB | {{f[ 431,
436 - 437).

1476. It was never disputed or concealed that KPM paid USD 72 million in dividends in
2009 and 2010. After Kazakhstan imposed the unlawful USD 145 million criminal
penalty in September 2009, Claimants prudently prevented cash from unnecessarily
flowing into KPM and TNG. This was lawful under the ECT, which allows
Claimants to retain profits. Claimants are not claiming damage in respect of these
profits. The USD 72 million in receivables that KPM distributed as dividends, and
the USD 143.4 million in uncollected receivables were generated prior to 14
October 2008. On 30 September 2008, KPM and TNG had a combined net
working capital of USD 222.6 million. (CPHB 2 { 290 — 294).

1477. There is no evidence to support Respondent’s allegation that Claimants transferred
hundreds of millions of dollars out of the Republic and did not subject it to Kazakh
taxation. (CPHB 1 { 438).

1478.Respondent’s valuation date of 22 July 2010 fails to respond to Claimants’ claims
and fails to account for how the State’s actions depressed the value of Claimants’
investments, including the crippling diminution in value and alienability of KPM
and TNG and the interference with normal business operations. Other tribunals
have recognized that a state’s wrongful actions can impair and depress an
investor’s assets long before the State actually acquires them. In Santa Elena v.
Costa Rica, the tribunal adopted the date of the decree to expropriate that
claimant’s property, even though the date of actual expropriation was years later.
The issue for the Tribunal is whether the State’s conduct “blights the possibility for
the owner reasonably to exploit the economic potential of the property.” The
state’s intent to expropriate is relevant to the determination of the valuation date,
since after that date, the investor’s ability to develop its investment is lost. In this
regard, Respondent’s argument that it did not express an intent to expropriate on 14
October 2008 is unpersuasive, as the evidence establishes an intent at the highest

levels of government to deprive Claimants of their investment in 2008. A
reasonable investor in the position of Claimants would have understood it as such.
(CPHB 2 {{{[ 276 — 282).

The Kardassopoulos v. Georgia award also supports Claimants’ valuation date.
That tribunal premised its valuation date on the decree that cast doubt on the
validity of the investor’s concession, rather than on the later expropriatory decree.
This Tribunal should follow that approach and award damages in the amount of
what Claimants should have been paid if the state had observed its international
obligations. Scholarly opinion from Prof. Reisman and Sloane also support this
approach. (CPHB 2 {{{[ 283 — 287).

It is common for tribunals, as demonstrated in Gemplus and Talsud v. Mexico,
Santa Elena v. Costa Rica, Tecmed v. Mexico, CMS v. Argentina, Siemens v.
Argentina, and Azurix v. Argentina not to adopt either of the parties’ valuation
dates or damages calculations outright, but to nonetheless award damage once
injury is proven. (CPHB 2 {{{[ 295 — 300). For the sake of argument, even if the
Tribunal were to adopt Kazakhstan’s valuation date, it would not be bound to use
Kazakhstan’s valuation. (CPHB 2 § 303).

The RBS Assessment for KMG EP on 31 July 2009 (valuation of October 2009)
contains substantial evidence on which the Tribunal could base its assessment of
damages. Based on this report, the Tribunal could select 18 December 2008 (date
of MEMR’s challenge to Claimants’ ownership of TNG), 30 April 2009 (state
sequestration of Claimants’ KPM and TNG shares and assets) or 18 September
2009 (judgment against Mr. Cornegruta). The RBS valuation, however, post dates
all of the non-governmental factors that Kazakhstan argues harm the FTI valuation,
and the Cliffson transaction executed on 13 February 2010. (CPHB 1 {fj 581 —
582).

2. Arguments by Respondent

Claimants’ intention on setting an early valuation date should be readily apparent:
an earlier valuation date helps inflate the claim by allowing the Tribunal to
disregard negative developments that ultimately caused KPM and TNG to fail,
including the drop in oil prices and demand. Moreover, the earlier the valuation
date, the bigger the reserves in the Borankol and Tolkyn fields. Deloitte has
calculated that 29.6% of Claimants’ Borankol claim and 49.4% of Claimants’
Tolkyn claim are based on cash flows occurring in the time in between the Parties’
valuation dates. (RPHB 1 {J 1102 — 1104).

Respondent states that “the Tribunal can only rely on 14 October 2008 as the
valuation date if it actually finds that there was a harassment campaign against
Claimants. [...] there was no such harassment campaign.” (R-II {| 37; RPHB 2
Ql 375 — 382).

Claimants’ date of 14 October 2008 is far too early and should be rejected by the
Tribunal. The Parties are in agreement: “/4 October 2008 is a date on which no
state measures against KPM and TNG were executed. No contracts were cancelled
on this day. No searches were conducted. No judgments were rendered. No
promises were given or broken.” The only event was President Nazarbayev

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 321 of 415
Page 320 of 414

forwarded a letter from President Voronin to authorities, asking them to thoroughly
investigate President Voronin’s accusations. That is not proof of a campaign
against Claimants, instead, it is a courtesy required between CIS Heads of State. It
is unclear that Claimants even knew about the Order until a considerable time
thereafter. In any event, Claimants’ argument that the letter of 14 October 2008
constituted a violation of the ECT is absurd. (R-I 47.8; R-II {J 272 — 279; R-II
ql 14 — 19; 36 — 37, 46; RPHB 1 {ff 1105 — 1107).

1485. Under international law, as held in the cases of International Technical Products v.
Iran, Tippets, Philips Petroleum v. Iran, and Santa Elena v. Costa Rica, the
valuation date is to be determined in reference to the actual expropriatory effect.
According to international practice for cases of indirect expropriation and as
explained in the ICSID case Santa Elena v. Costa Rica and in Azurix v. Argentina,
the valuation date must be the date at which the deprivation of property rights has
turned out to be irreversible. Here, the only date at which Claimants possibly could
have been deprived of their ownership rights in KPM and TNG was 21 July 2010.
In the Sedco v. NIOC, on which Claimants rely, there was a much harsher
interference than alleged in the present case. Claimants’ selective citation of
Professors Reisman and Sloan completely disregards their denunciation of
improperly early valuation dates. Finally, Claimants’ reliance on the full
compensation principle as set out in the Chorzéw case to support an improperly
early valuation date is unacceptable. The Chorzéw requirement to “wip/e] out the
effects of the expropriatory state action presupposes that there are measures with
actual effect on the companies, not mere purported intentions of state bodies.”
Under that principle, Claimants must rely on conduct, not on alleged intentions. (R-
III {24 — 32, 37 — 44; RPHB 1 {fff 1108 — 1111).

1486. An unduly early valuation date would have the consequence of providing double
compensation. KKPM and TNG were producing oil until the 21 July 2010
termination of the contracts (also undermining the earlier valuation date). An
improperly early valuation leads to double counting this income. For 2009, KPM’s
financial statements demonstrate that KPM earned at least USD 81,235,291 from
the sale of oil. (R-I [ 47.3, R-II {ff 45, 442 — 446). In 2010, KPM distributed
dividends in the amount of USD 71.9 million, paid by assigning trade receivables
to Ascom. Claimants have provided no evidence that this amount originated in
profits earned prior to 14 October 2008 or that Ascom reinvested any of the money
received (which would be contrary to Claimants’ admission that they tried to take
out the money to protect that they could). The only money that may have been
reinvested was a coupon payment made by Tristan in the amount of USD 28
million. KPM and TNG also extended the due date of accounts receivables due
from Stadoil Ltd. and General Affinity in the amount of USD 143.4 — money which
was never paid. Since Claimants did not prepare financial statements for 2010, one
cannot evaluate whether other significant cash outflow may have also occurred.
An advance in the amount of USD 36,800,212 related to the LPG Plant has,
likewise, not been accounted for. In any event, while the Republic has never
argued that Claimants made profits during the relevant time period, FTI assumed
that TNG’s and KPM's production from 14 October 2008 to 21 July 2010 would
have amounted to USD 226.6, corrected to USD 302.3 in Deloitte’s Additional
note. (R-II [442 — 446; RPHB 2 {J 883 — 892).

Claimants need to prove that the payments made after 14 October 2008 were
indeed paid from additional assets, earnings, and cash flows which would not have
been included in the DCF cash flow analysis. They have failed to do so and only
alleged that the dividends were paid out of pre-14 October 2008 funds, for the first
time, in their First Post-Hearing Brief. They have only provided a conclusory
statement that at the end of September 2008, KPM and TNG combined had USD
221.5 million in net working capital. The fact that the dividend distribution
occurred on 31 December 2009 indicates that the receivables that were assigned
(ie. the dividend), accrued after 14 October 2008. Alternatively, had the
receivables existed prior to 14 October 2008, obligations toward KPM and TNG
would not have been fulfilled for | year 2 months. Thus, the receivables diverted
from KPM to Ascom as dividends need to be deducted from the asset value and
from an eventual award, if it were to be based on the FTI calculation. Likewise,
the USD 143.4 million which appear to be due from two companies in the Stati
Group — Stadoil Ltd. and General Affinity, would need to be deducted from an
eventual award. It appears that money was transferred to these Stati subsidiaries to
prevent these assets from being used to satisfy the recovery order. Claimants do
not allege that these receivables were generated prior to 14 October 2008. These
receivables need to be deducted from a damage calculation. (RPHB 2 {| 893 —
918).

Claimants allege that the termination of Contracts 210 and 305 and the transfer of
those assets into trust management on 21 July 2010 effected a direct expropriation.
If one were to assume that a violation of the ECT had occurred, it is clear that 21
July 2010, under the international legal standard of compensation for expropriation,
would be the valuation date of such an alleged direct or even indirect expropriation,
since this is the date on which Claimants irreversibly lost rights in the dispute.
Even in cases where the expropriation only came into effect later, the relevant date
for valuation is the date of expropriation. (R-II {{] 20 — 23; RPHB 1 { 1114 —
1117; RPHB 2 {{[ 990 — 992).

None of the four alleged actions — taken individually or collectively — which are to
have occurred prior to 21 July 2010 can serve as the valuation date in this present
case as they did not amount to an indirect expropriation because they did not cause
Claimants to be deprived of their property rights. The only piece of evidence that
Claimants used to attempt to show that they were deprived of their right to sell the
companies was the Squire Sanders Due Diligence Report, which — contrary to
Claimants’ misinterpretation — made no mention that the Republic’s assertion of its
pre-emptive rights was improper. Instead, it recognized that the transfer in TNG
from Gheso to Terra Raf was effected in breach of the government’s first refusal
right. Claimants have failed to prove that this would have actually deterred an
interested buyer and, therefore, have failed to prove that they were irreversibly
deprived of their rights prior to 21 July 2010. (R-III {J 33 — 35; RPHB 2 {| 993 —
1001).

In their closing submissions, in particular in the discussion related to the Laren
loan, Claimants also conceded that they were not deprived of their property rights
prior to July 2010. They admitted to enjoying full property rights. (RPHB 2 {If
1003 — 1004).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 323 of 415
Page 322 of 414

1491.Even if the Tribunal relies on a valuation date prior to 21 July 2010, it should — in
conformity with international practice — take external circumstances and
Claimants’ own actions up to 21 July 2010 into account. (R-II {J 425 — 426;
RPHB 2 {{{| 1006 — 1009). Subsequent events may affect the extent of damage
caused by illegal state actions. This was confirmed in Amco Asia v. Indonesia as
well as in scholarly writings. Here, there is a clear correlation between the timing
of the companies’ financial troubles and external events. The impact of these
external factors has been admitted by Claimants as well as by Respondent’s
independent valuation expert. These external factors led to a diminution of value —
a diminution that Claimants would have suffered even in the absence of the alleged
unlawful act. In particular, the Tribunal should consider:

(a) a sharp drop in oil and gas prices in 2008 and 2009;
(b) a sharp drop in local demand in 2009;

(c) the company’s customers’ conduct and the company’s own
business decisions;

(d) the general undercapitalization of the companies and the constant
withdrawal of cash from the companies;

(e) the companies’ failure to pay taxes on time as required by law;

ip and the consequential taking out of the so-called Laren loan which
was extremely risky and required the payment of very high interest
rates. (R-III 1] 426 (quoted), 427 — 435, R-II 1] 722 — 726).

1492. Since Claimants have the burden of proof on the existence and extent, and since
they have presented no other calculations other than those based on the improper
14 October 2008 valuation date, the damages claim must be dismissed in its
entirety. The Tribunal cannot replace Claimants’ failure to discharge their
procedural duties by applying some form of discretion. The Tribunal may not
unilaterally assist Claimants by determining a discretionary value at another
valuation date. This is confirmed in Rompetrol v. Romania, which determined that
no damages could be awarded when the claimant had presented only results from
one valuation technique that the Tribunal had determined to be inappropriate.
(RPHB 1 {ff 1112 — 1113; RPHB 2 {J 56 — 58).

3. The Tribunal

1493. The Parties differ considerably regarding the valuation date. Claimants argue that
the date of the President’s Order 14 October 2008 is the date necessary to fully
compensate Claimants for the injuries caused by Kazakhstan’s violations of the
ECT and international law. Respondent argues that, even if one were to assume
that a violation of the ECT had occurred, it is clear that 21 July 2010, under the
international legal standard of compensation for expropriation, would be the
valuation date of such an alleged direct or even indirect expropriation, since this is
the date on which Claimants irreversibly lost rights in the dispute.

1494.A preliminary question is whether the Tribunal can select any dates, other than
those two, as the correct valuation date. Respondent argues that Claimants have

presented no calculations other than those based on the improper 14 October 2008
valuation date and the damages claim must be dismissed in its entirety if the
Tribunal does not accept that valuation date. This is not correct, since Claimants
have in fact addressed other valuation dates (CPHB | {{{ 581 — 582) and the
quantum of damages to be calculated by such dates. Indeed, the RBS Assessment
for KMG EP on 31 July 2009, though primarily relying on a valuation of October
2009, contains substantial evidence on which the Tribunal could base its
assessment of damages either by 18 December 2008 (date of MEMR’s challenge to
Claimants’ ownership of TNG), 30 April 2009 (state sequestration of Claimants’
KPM and TNG shares and assets), or 18 September 2009 (judgment against Mr.
Cornegruta).

The Tribunal, therefore, is in a position to select another valuation date if it
considers that appropriate. Separate therefrom, the Tribunal will have to examine
later in the chapter on Quantum in this Award, which damages have been proved
for the chosen valuation date.

Turning to the question of which is the valuation date to be selected, the Tribunal
considers that the date of 14 or 16 October 2008 suggested by Claimants cannot be
accepted. Claimants have not shown that, already at that time, any damages were
caused by Respondent’s breaches of the ETC. Though the President’s Order in
October almost immediately caused various government actions against Claimants’
investment, which were the beginning of a continuing breach of the FET-standard
of the ECT, as seen above in the chapter on causation in this Award, the effects of
these breaches damaging the investments only started in December 2008.

The Tribunal considers that only by 30 April 2009, when the State sequestration of
Claimants’ KPM and TNG shares and assets occurred, actual, and permanent
damages could be identified for the investments.

Selecting a later date would be inappropriate, as the State sequestration made it
impossible for Claimants to continue with their investments and the damages
continued to occur from thereon. In particular, that implies that the damages had
already occurred to a great extent before the valuation date in 2010 suggested by
Respondent.

Therefore, in its following considerations on the quantum of damages, the Tribunal
will rely on 30 April 2009 as the determinative valuation date.

Based on this valuation date, the Tribunal will have to hereafter proceed in all its
calculation of damages. Since, contrary to that finding, the Parties have primarily
relied on different valuation dates, ie. Claimants on 14 October 2008, Respondent
on 21 July 2010, for their calculations of damages, the Tribunal has to examine
whether the Parties’ arguments regarding the calculation of damages can still be
applied to the valuation date found to be applicable by the Tribunal.

This task is easier regarding Claimants’ arguments, because the time difference
between 14/16 October 2008 and 30 April 2009 is rather shorter and fewer relevant
events have occurred during that period which might have changed the value of the
investment and thus the calculation of damages. The Tribunal will take this

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 325 of 415
Page 324 of 414

difference of the valuation dates relied upon into account when examining the
various damage claims raised by Claimants.

1502.On the other hand, regarding Respondent’s calculation, not only is the time
difference between 30 April 2009 and 21 July 2010 considerably longer, but in
particular the Respondent’s conduct during that period, which the Tribunal found
above in this Award to be a breach of the ECT and the cause of the damages,
obviously had a a considerable influence on the value of the investment and, thus,
the quantum of damages. It does not need any further explanation that this conduct
caused the two companies affected to lose value due to the breaching treatment by
Respondent and that Respondent cannot rely for the calculation of the damages on
its own breaches and their effects.

1503.Respondent has argued regarding the calculation of damages on the basis of an
earlier valuation date than the one it considers relevant, referring to the report of
Deloitte GmbH, that KPM and TNG were already in severe financial difficulties
even before October 2008 (RPHB 2 p. 17). The Tribunal will take this argument
into account insofar as relevant when examining the various damage claims raised
by Claimants.

L.II. Arguments Regarding the Treatment of Debt:
Enterprise vs. Equity Value

1. Arguments by Claimants

1504. Claimants seek an award based on the value of the assets that Kazakhstan impaired
and seized, namely the operating “enterprises” of KPM and TNG. Thus,
Claimants seek the enterprise value of their investments, meaning the value of the
companies’ assets without deducting their debt. Enterprise value is the appropriate
measure of damages under the ECT and customary international law, and has been
used in similar cases. The equity value position argued by Kazakhstan is incorrect
as a matter of treaty law and is unwarranted by the facts. At a basic level, the
equity value argument is incorrect because Respondent did not simply seize
Claimants’ equity — it seized all of the assets of KPM and TNG without assuming
or extinguishing their debts and, at the same time, making KPM and TNG unable
to satisfy their debts. Thus, the injury includes the assets that were seized and the
debts that the companies are unable to repay as a result of the seizures. Neither the
ECT, nor scholarly commentary, nor basic economics provide support for
Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal distinguish between assets and debts and
award only equity, thereby limiting the damages to the value of the shareholdings
in KPM and TNG. To do so would unjustly enrich Kazakhstan. Moreover, the
expropriation section of the ECT provides that compensation shall amount to the
FMV of the investment exploited, which is the assets of KPM and TNG, not their
equity. This approach is supported in scholarly commentary, as well. (CPHB | {If
597 — 601, 606 — 610, 617 — 620; CPHB 2 {If 304, 314).

1505. Respondent has misframed this issue into whether the Tribunal should “add” debts
to Claimants’ damages. Instead, however, the issue is whether the Tribunal should
deduct the value of debts from the assets impaired and taken. The full enterprise
value is the appropriate measure of damages, pursuant to the Chorzéw measure of
full reparation, pursuant to which the correct measure of damages “must as far as

possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the
situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been
committed.” But for Kazakhstan’s action, KPM and TNG would have continued to
operate their business, generating cashflows to KPM and TNG, and Claimants
would have been entitled to direct those flows to reinvest, pay dividends, and/or to
pay off debts of KPM, TNG, and Tristan (under the KPM and TNG guarantees).
Since the Tribunal cannot order restitution, however, the Tribunal’s award should
include all future cash flows of the assets taken, without deducting debts. This
would mirror restitution as closely as possible and wipe out all consequences of
Kazakhstan’s actions. Deduction of debts would give no compensation for
Claimants’ loss of their right to direct cash flows to repay creditors before
distributing dividends to themselves. (CPHB 2 {{{[ 305 — 309).

Enterprise value is the correct measure, regardless of whether Claimants are
directly liable for the debts, as authorized under Art. 13 ECT, pursuant to which
FMV is to be paid for a lawfully expropriated investment. It is well settled under
customary international law that the “full reparation” standard should apply to
unlawful expropriation. The ECT’s broad definition of “Jnvestment” as including
assets that are directly and indirectly owned by the Investor, as also recognized in
scholarly commentary, also supports this argument that the enterprise value should
be compensated. (CPHB 2 {[ 313 — 316).

At the Hearing on Quantum, Kazakhstan equated FMV with equity value, which is
incorrect as a matter of international practice. It is true that a potential buyer would
have deducted the companies’ debt from the enterprise value, if the buyer were
acquiring only the equity and, thus, assuming all the liabilities. Here, Kazakhstan
took the assets of KPM and TNG, but did not assume or extinguish the companies’
liabilities. Thus, the FMV says nothing about whether that measure should be
applied to Claimants’ equity stake. (CPHB 1 §{ 611 — 614; CPHB 2 314).

Importantly, Respondent is liable for the injuries suffered, irrespective of whether
Claimants remain liable for the debts (but all the more so, since they remain liable).
(CPHB 1 {{{[ 602 — 606).

Respondent cites Impregilo v. Pakistan and PSEG v. Turkey, which are inapposite.
Here, unlike in Jmpregilo, Claimants are the 100% owners of KPM and TNG and
are not asserting claims on behalf of any other parties. Likewise, when the PSEG
tribunal refused compensation, it did so in a case that did not involve companies
that were wholly owned by the claimant, as is the case, here. (CPHB 2 {{[ 317 —
318).

In its Rejoinder on Quantum, Respondent expressly agreed that, insofar as
Claimants remain responsible for the Tristan debt, enterprise value is the correct
measure of damages. While Respondent attempted to retreat from this statement at
the May 2013 hearing, it did not attempt to reconcile its prior statement. The
argument that Ascom and Terra Raf are not liable to repay the noteholders is, in
any event, incorrect. They are obliged to repay the noteholders, pursuant to
Section 6 of the Pledge Agreement. (CPHB 2 {fj 319 — 322).

An award of the enterprise value would under-compensate Claimants and enable
Respondent to take the assets, worth at least USD 186 million, for free.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 327 of 415
Page 326 of 414

Respondent would be unjustly enriched. As a result, Chorzéw Factory observed
that damages should not be reduced by the amount of obligations that claimants
owe to third parties, even if that means that third parties may receive a portion of
an arbitral award. The tribunal in Occidental v. Ecuador also applied that principle
to reject Ecuador’s efforts to reduce the award by deducting obligations that the
claimant there owed to third parties. As in Occidental, the Claimants have
demonstrated their commitment to honor their obligations to the noteholders. The
notion that Claimants would be enriched by the Sharing Agreement that
noteholders embraced is outweighed by the unjust enrichment that would accrue to
Respondent if it were obliged to compensate only the equity value of the assets
taken. (CPHB | {| 637 — 640; CPHB 2 {If 323 — 328).

1512. While the Tristan Debt is the largest at issue, Respondent also argues that the
damages award must be reduced by other debts allegedly owed by KPM and TNG
including, (1) amounts owed to Vitol under the COMSA prepayment terms and
LPG financing arrangements; (2) outstanding debts under the Laren facility; and
(3) the USD 62 million corporate back tax assessment. These debts should not be
deducted from Claimants’ damages for the same reasons that the Tristan debt
should not be. (CPHB 2 {[ 328; CPHB 1 {ff 641 — 649).

2. Arguments by Respondent

1513.Claimants use the noteholder claim to “gross up” their damages claim by creating
an enterprise value for KPM and TNG that simply ignores the debt of those
companies, which must be considered in a compensation claim. By the date of the
first Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants had still not provided a full breakdown of
KPM’s and TNG’s debts, making a complete valuation impossible and making it,
likewise, impossible to show Claimants’ damage. The debt under the Tristan notes
is, therefore, used to evaluate the debt, here. (RPHB 1 {{ 1050 — 1054, 1063, 1071;
RPHB 2 {{{[ 956).

1514. As of 21 July 2010, the minimum amount of noteholder debt could have stood at
USD 559 million (principal of USD 531.1 million + interest of 27.9 million that
Tristan had failed to pay). KPM and TNG are liable for more than 81.2 million in
taxes. The additional debt that KPM and TNG had as of 13 February 2010 was
valued by FTI to be USD 119 million. (RPHB | {J 1057, 1063 — 1067; RPHB 2 {[
923). Deloitte has determined that the enterprise value of KPM and TNG
cumulatively amounts to USD 186 million. As 21 July 2010, they were liable for
at least USD 759.2 million in debt. Accordingly, they had an equity value of zero,
and Claimants have suffered no damage whatsoever. This is consistent with how
debt markets treated the Tristan debt as of 14 October 2008, when they were
treated as close to zero, being traded at USD 65.125 for a nominal amount of USD
100. This is an indication that the markets considered default more likely than not,
in such event noteholders would only be able to recover 65.125%. Accepting the
enterprise value of USD 186 million but ignoring the USD 759.2 million in debt,
Claimants would receive USD 65.4 million of that amount by operation of Section
4(b) of the Sharing Agreement after the deduction of expenses. With an enterprise
value of USD 186 million, Claimants would not have suffered any damage in the
first place, but would nonetheless receive compensation. (RPHB | {{{[ 1080 — 1084,
1099 — 1101).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 328 of 415
Page 327 of 414

1515.There is, however, no risk of unjust enrichment if the award is based on equity
value. Claimants would receive the precise value of their shareholding. The
noteholders could bring their own claims under the applicable BITs and obtain
their own award against the Republic. Insofar as their claims would fail for lack of
jurisdiction ratione personae, this does not lead to unjust enrichment, but is rather
a result of the BITs and the fact that the Republic has only agreed to arbitrate
disputes with certain investors and not with others. (RPHB 2 {[ 953 — 955).

1516.A debt gross-up is contrary to international law. Claimants’ arguments that the
investment definition in the ECT requires compensation according to enterprise
value, and that Ripinsky and Williams stated so in their book, and that there is
international practice supporting an award based on enterprise value, are incorrect.
(RPHB 2 {ff 925 — 928).

1517.Respondent explains that Claimants’ argument is logically flawed because it
ignores that KPM and TNG pledged for the entire Tristan debt with all of their
assets and the entire business enterprise. “Thus, even if one assumed that the
investments are the assets and the business enterprise of KPM and TNG, the
Tristan debt must be deducted from the value of those assets and this business
enterprise. As Tristan had no operative business of its own, KPM and TNG were
practically liable for the Tristan debt themselves, meaning that all of their assets
were subject to potential enforcement measures by the noteholders. This directly
undercuts the value of these assets. Thus, even assuming that Claimants’
investments were the assets and the business enterprise of KPM and TNG, debt
would still need to be deducted and equity value would still be the correct measure
of damages.” This argument has the unacceptable consequence that an investor
could claim the enterprise value even if it had not remained liable for any of the
investment vehicle’s debt. This would allow for spectacular enrichment of an
investor. Claimants’ argument makes no differentiation between situations where
an investor remained liable or not. Thus, it is no surprise that Ripinsky and
Williams do not support Claimants’ conclusions — they do not take any side of
either enterprise or equity value. Claimants are citing authority where there is
none. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 929 — 931).

1518.There is no uncontroversial principle of international law that enterprise value can
be claimed if the investor remained liable for the investment’s debt. The opposite
is true: the only international principle that has come into existence is the principle
that debt must be deducted from the enterprise or asset value in question. As was
explained in Impregilo v. Pakistan and PSEG v. Turkey, to hold otherwise would
make it possible for an investor with standing to bring a claim on behalf of another
who does not have standing. The fact that those cases involved investors who were
not 100% shareholders in the local subsidiary makes no difference. Impreglio also
observed that, like in this case, a tribunal has no means of compelling a successful
claimant to pass on the appropriate share of damages to other shareholders or
participants. The Jmpreglio tribunal, thus, contemplated the situation of
shareholders as well as debtholders. (RPHB 2 {fj 932 — 936).

1519. Claimants’ reference to the Enron case is designed to confuse and to simulate the
existence of authority where there is none. The paragraph referenced concerns the
determination of the percentage of shares in a company that belonged to Enron and
has no relevance here. Occidential also concerned a fundamentally different

Page 328 of 414

question and not the value of the shareholding. Respondent does not understand
why Claimants referenced Azurix in the Final Hearing. (RPHB 2 {{[ 937 — 938).

Claimants’ reference to Chorzéw is misplaced. First, that case played out in a pre-
BIT era where there was no possibility that debtholders were circumventing the
requirements of their own claim — diplomatic protection did not foresee the
bringing of claims by debtholders or by states on behalf of them. The Chorzéw
standard of restitution also misses the mark. The suggestion that Claimants must
be put into a position in which they hold the cash flows created by KPM and TNG
and in which they can direct these cash flows to Tristan noteholders is not
supported by that decision. Chorzdw does not provide for how the consequences of
an illegal action should be wiped out. Factually, the repayment of the Tristan note
debt was not to be conducted through the Claimants. Instead the repayment from
Tristan to the noteholders was to be realized from the proceeds of loans that KPM
and TNG had entered into with Tristan. It is not the case that Claimants were to
forward KPM and TNG’s cashflows to noteholders. An award that was grossed up
for the Tristan debt “would not recreate the hypothetical situation without the
alleged breach if all hypothetical cash flows of KPM and TNG were directly
awarded to the Claimants.” (RPHB 2 §§ 939 — 943).

Respondent will not speculate on whether “Claimants are actively acting on behalf
of the Tristan noteholders and as a front for the actual noteholder claim.” If
successful, however, Claimants’ claim has the practical consequence that
Claimants serve for the noteholders to realize the noteholders’ claim. It would
have the same effect which was the salient point under Impreglio and PSEG, where
the tribunals declined to compensate the claimants for the amounts they owed to
creditors. (RPHB 2 944).

Ascom and Terra Raf are not liable toward the Tristan noteholders under Section 6
of the Terra Raf and Ascom Pledge Agreements. The limited scope of Section 6(b)
clearly refers to “dividends” and “distributions.” Hypothetical awards against
Respondent are not covered. The Pledge Agreements must be interpreted under
Kazakh law, pursuant to which only the activity of the LLP is subject to the
pledges. Potential awards are not covered by the text of the pledges. The text of
Section 6(b) also speaks against its argued purpose of covering payments from an
award. In addition, the competent ICC tribunal has the authority to determine
whether Claimants have liability to noteholders. Claimants’ argument that
Respondent needs to compensate Claimants before such liability has even been
proven before an ICC tribunal is ludicrous. The only way that Respondent could
theoretically even be liable for an enterprise value claim would be if Claimants did
remain liable — but even then there are strong arguments under international law
that only equity value could be awarded, and Respondent has never admitted the
opposite. (RPHB 2 {| 945 — 952).

Regarding additional debt, Claimants have not responded to Respondent’s
arguments that the debt under the Reachcom Facility Agreement, the Limozen
Facility Agreement, and the Reachcom Receivables Purchase Agreement, need to
be deducted. The Tribunal should consider this as a concession. (RPHB 2 {[ 957).

Regarding the KPM and TNG COMSA prepayment arrangements, the envisioned
sharing of cash-flows from the envisioned joint venture capital company needs to

1528.

Page 329 of 414

be deducted from a claim for the LPG Plant. The COMSAs, however, refer to an
existing date as of the valuation date. Claimants do not contest that the COMSA
debt existed as of 21 July 2010 and they do not explain why it would not need to be
deducted from their claims. Claimants, therefore, admit that this debt needs to be
deducted. (RPHB 2 {If 959 — 960).

While Respondent disputes that it had any role in Claimants taking out the Laren
loan, Claimants have not proven that their debt under the Laren loan has been
repaid, beyond the incredible evidence of Mr. Lungu. It is also unproven that
repayment caused any loss to Claimants. (RPHB 2 {[ 961 — 962). Tax debt also
needs to be deducted. (RPHB 2 {{ 963).

Contrary to the position advanced by FTI, the Tristan Note price is not an indicator
of enterprise value and that valuation method is not commonly used, nor is the
Morning Star Index. The Morning Star Index depicts the 5 year average of debt to
total capital average of gearings (typical debt to typical capital ratio) for the oil and
gas industry and stood at 19.5 % on 30 September 2008. Thus, FTI assumes that
the market value of the Tristan notes (USD 273.5 million) represents 19.5% of the
total enterprise value, making that value be USD 1.4 billion for KPM and TNG as
of 14 October 2008. There is no typical debt to total capital ratio that applies to all
companies in the oil and gas industry. There are wild variations, ranging from zero
to 97%. Accordingly, the average is not a reliable method for valuation. As of
both valuation dates, the markets expected Tristan to default on its notes, which
means that the market value was close to the enterprise value of the companies at
the time of the issue. This is because, in the event of default, the remaining
relevant right of the noteholders is a primary claim to the enterprise value of the
companies. As of 14 October 2008, the value of KPM and TNG as derived from
the value of the Tristan notes was approximately USD 221.5 million —
approximately one third of FTI’s DCF calculations. As of the valuation date of 21
July 2010, the value was approximately USD 215.5 million, which is fairly close to
Deloitte’s DCF calculation of USD 186 million. (RPHB 1 [fj 1031 — 1037).

3. The Tribunal

The Parties disagree regarding the relevance of the Chorzéw Award. The Tribunal
considers that the starting point for the calculation of damages should indeed be the
formula applied in the Chorzé6w Award, and often applied in investment
arbitrations as well, i.e. that the damages awarded “must as far as possible, wipe
out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which
would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.”

For their respective arguments relating to the treatment of debts in this context, the
Parties rely on several decisions of other tribunals, but disagree as to which of them
are comparable to the situation in the present case and what their findings mean for
the present dispute. The Tribunal finds that none of these earlier decisions exactly
deal with a situation as exists in the present case. While taking into account the
considerations in these earlier decisions, the Tribunal will turn to the specifics of
the case at hand.

The Parties disagree regarding the relevance of the Sharing Agreement. In that
regard, this Tribunal considers that an approach similar to that taken by the tribunal

in the OPEC case Occidental v. Ecuador (R-355 §§ 654 et seq.) is the most
appropriate: Such an agreement concluded long after the breach of the ECT in
order to share the risk and proceeds of an award in the present case cannot be a
factor reducing the damages owed by Respondent.

In principle, Claimants are correct in their argument that, but for Kazakhstan’s
action, KPM and TNG would have continued to operate their business, generating
cashflows to KPM and TNG, and Claimants would have been entitled to direct
those flows to reinvest, pay dividends, and/or pay off debts of KPM, TNG, and
Tristan (under the KPM and TNG guarantees).

Since the Tribunal cannot order restitution and restitution is not a relief sought by
Claimants, the Tribunal’s award should include future cash flows of the assets
taken.

However, the Tribunal does not agree with Claimants that this approach would
automatically mean that no debts of the seized companies can be deducted at all.
Since Claimants, after the taking by Respondent, are no longer the owners of KPM
and TNG, they should not be compensated for any debts for which they now are no
longer liable and for which Respondent, or the new owner to which the assets were
transferred, is now solely liable.

As the Claimants have the burden of proof for all damages claimed, they must be
considered to have the burden of proving that they remain liable for a debt after the
taking by Respondent. On the other hand, Respondent must be considered to have
the burden of proof for the exception that it, or the new owner to which it passed
the assets, is solely liable for a debt.

As recorded above in this Award, between 21 and 22 July 2010, the Prime Minister
and the Minister of Oil and Gas publicly declared the takeover and abrogation of
the Claimants’ Subsoil Use Contracts, seizure of the assets of KPM and TNG and
caused them, in due course, to be transferred to KMG, which later appointed its
subsidiary KMT as “trust manager” for the companies. (C-3, C-4, C-5, C-189, and
C-190).

The Tribunal will, therefore, examine the debts which Respondent argues have to
be deducted and will ascertain who is still liable for them at this time.

Regarding the Tristan notes as the by far largest debt, Respondent expressly agreed
in its Rejoinder on Quantum (R-III {{ 383) that, insofar as Claimants remain
responsible for the Tristan debt, enterprise value is the correct measure of damages.
While Respondent’s statement at the May 2013 Hearing may perhaps be
understood as changing that position, it did not attempt to reconcile its prior
statement and the Tribunal still agrees with Respondent's earlier position.

Based on the information before it, the Tribunal concludes that Ascom and Terra
Raf are still liable to repay the noteholders pursuant to Section 6 of the Pledge
Agreement. That provision expressly includes in the payments to be made to the
pledgeholder “other payment or distribution of any kind.” The Tribunal sees no
reason why this general language should be restricted to payments of KPM and

and 247). Quite to the contrary, if Claimants, in the present arbitration, would not
claim the value of the Tristan debts, they might be held liable for not pursuing the
interests of the pledgeholders.

Beyond the Tristan issue, regarding additional debt, the Tribunal agrees with
Respondent that Claimants have not sufficiently responded to Respondent’s
arguments that the debt under the Reachcom Facility Agreement, the Limozen
Facility Agreement, and the Reachcom Receivables Purchase Agreement, need to
be deducted. Even if the Tribunal does not consider this as a concession, it does
consider that Claimants have not fulfilled their burden of proof in this regard and
that, therefore, these debts have indeed to be subtracted from any damages.

Regarding the obligations to VITOL under the COMSA prepayment terms and
LPG financing arrangements, the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that
these must be deducted from the damages awarded. As testified by Mr. Lungu (Tr.
Hearing January 2013, day 1 p. 185/186), VITOL never owned part of the LPG
Plant. As explained by Claimants (CPHB | {[ 643), the prepayment arrangements
guaranteed by KPM and TNG were not a separate debt but regarded VITOL’s
portion of the debt financing for construction of the LPG Plant. The Joint
Operating Agreement with VITOL for the LPG Plant project (First FTI Scope of
Review No.44) expressly provides that, in the event that the Government seeks any
rights of pre-emption, VITOL is still entitled to payment from ASCOM of the fair
value price and that ASCOM shall seek to recover such amounts from the
Government.

The Laren debt was caused by the conduct of Respondent which this Tribunal
now found to be a breach of the ECT. Furthermore, it has been repaid as testified
by Mr. Lungu (Tr. Hearing January 2013, day 1 p.191). The Tribunal sees no
reason why it should be deducted from the damages awarded.

Finally, the alleged back tax obligations were created by Respondent’s conduct
which this Tribunal found above to be a breach of the ECT. Further, KPM and
TNG prevailed in their court challenges of the tax assessments. The only appellate
decision in favour of Respondent was issued after the seizure of the investment in a
review process alleged by Claimants to have been conducted without their
knowledge or participation. In any case, the Tribunal considers that Respondent
has not fulfilled its burden of proof that the tax assessment would have been valid
even without the conduct found to be a breach above in this Award.

In view of the above, the Tribunal concludes that only the debts under the
Reachcom Facility Agreement, the Limozen Facility Agreement, and the
Reachcom Receivables Purchase Agreement are to be deducted from the damages
to be awarded.

L.IV. Quantum Related to Borankol Field and Tolkyn
Field

1. Arguments by Claimants

The hostile investment environment created by Respondent, combined with the
liquidity shortage which was also caused by Respondent (i.e. the absence of Credit

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 333 of 415
Page 332 of 414

Suisse loan), forced Claimants to reduce development efforts at Borankol and
Tolkyn fields. This caused Claimants to decide not to drill or recomplete 13 wells
at Borankol and Tolkyn in 2009 — 2010. This caused three injuries: (1) KPM and
TNG lost revenue that they would have earned from their planned production; (2)
the gap in the development efforts artificially depressed the production curve at
Tolkyn and Borankol. The production that forms the basis for GCA’s decline
curve analysis is lower than it would have been had Claimants been able to develop
the fields without Kazakhstan’s influence. Claimants (3) were unable to promptly
respond to the watering issues at the Tolkyn field. (CPHB | {{{[ 365 — 368; CPHB 2
222).

1544. After the Hearing on Quantum, Claimants stated that both Parties have valued the
Tolkyn and Borankol fields using the DCF method, which is undisputedly the
appropriate method for valuing these assets. Based on FTI’s DCF valuation, which
relies on the geological analysis of Ryder Scott, Claimants request the following
damages (CPHB | {{{[ 524 — 528):

 

 

 

Borankol US $197,013,000
Tolkyn US $478,927,000
Munaibay Oil US $96,808,000

 

 

 

 

1545.Before the Hearing on Quantum, FTI’s valuation of the Borankol field and the
Tolkyn field as of 14 October 2008 was USD 231.5 million and USD 508.4
million, respectively. FTI arrived at these sums by assessing (1) distribution costs,
(2) a mix of fixed versus variable costs in FTI’s forecast of cost of goods sold, (3)
recompletion CAPEX, (4) an estimate for liquidation expenses, and (5)
depreciation. FTI has also adjusted its application of EPT to properly calculate
EPT on income after corporate income taxes. (C-III {J 75 — 76).

1546. Claimants’ right to export gas at international prices is relevant to TNG’s and its
prospective purchaser’s reasonable expectations as of 14 October 2008. FTI
assumed that a willing buyer, on 14 October 2008, would have been able to sell in
export markets and acquire the prevailing international export prices for those
sales. The CAC Pipeline — a direct export route — is proximate to the Tolkyn field.
At the time, Respondent was forecasting both an expansion of total gas production
from 33.7 Bem’ in 2008 to 61.5 Bem’ by 2015, with a concomitant export volume
expansion from 6.2 Bem’ in 2008 to 12.9 Bem’ in 2015. Regarding pricing, in
March 2008 there was every indication that companies from Turkmenistan,
Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan would export gas at European price levels, minus
relevant transport and storage costs, by January 2009. In 2008, KMG even
announced expectations that its own price could increase by 60 — 70% from
January 2009, up to USD 306/mem. (C-III {ff 8 — 11).

10. That TNG’s future receipt of international export prices was reasonably
contemplated in 2008 is also clear from several of the indicative offers that
Claimants received for TNG’s Tolkyn field in the initial round of Project
Zenith. A comparison of FTI’s valuation of the Tolkyn field and the

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 334 of 415
Page 333 of 414

indicative offers demonstrates this. FTI has valued TNG’s Tolkyn field as
of October 14, 2008 at US $508.4 million, using a DCF methodology and
incorporating as an important element the receipt of future gas export
prices at a flat US $180 per 1000 cubic meters (a conservative estimate
given the fact that export prices were set to be raised at the time to US
$305 per 1000 cubic meters in January of 2009). By comparison, among
the initial round of indicative offers received by Claimants, the Tolkyn field
as a segregated component was valued by KNOC at US $1,067 million on
an enterprise value basis, by OMV Exploration & Production GmbH at US
$952 million on an enterprise value basis, and by Total at US $730 million
on an equity basis using DCF methodology. The magnitude of these offers
indicates that they certainly contemplated receipt of export prices for
TNG’s gas as a critical component. (C-III { 10).

1547. Deloitte makes the unreasonable assumption that all natural gas produced from the
Borankol and Tolkyn fields would be sold on the domestic Kazakhstan market,
even though a significant proportion of the gas production from these fields was
sold on the export market. Deloitte’s assumption is contrary to Claimants’ right to
export gas under the Subsoil Use Contracts (which Respondent has not contested),
and is contrary to the negotiated (but not signed) Tripartite Agreement.
Respondent does not address Claimants’ explicit contractual right to export gas
under its Subsoil Use Contract, the self-evident inclusion of export pricing
assumptions in the initial round of Project Zenith offers, the proximity of the CAC
Pipeline, or the State’s own projections as of 2008 regarding increases in gas
production, exports, and export prices. Instead, Respondent selectively focuses on
deficiencies in the Tripartite Agreement. An examination of the negotiation
documents, however, shows that the parties intended to enter into a long-term
agreement for the supply of natural gas. The preliminary agreement signed by
representatives of all three parties set out in careful detail the two explicit export
pricing methodologies for deliveries of gas to KazAzot and KMG. That the
Tripartite Agreement was not signed and that KazAzot decided against
construction of the fertilizer plant is irrelevant for the establishment of TNG’s and
its prospective purchaser’s reasonable expectations for two reasons. First, through
August 2009, the Tripartite Agreement was a viable prospect and confirmatory
reason for the belief that TNG would be able to export gas at international prices.
Second, KMG executed the 17 November 2008 Agreement, giving its clear
indication that gas exports and export prices could reasonable be presumed to be
available to a prospective purchaser upon entry into negotiations with KMG,
regardless of the KazAzot fertilizer project. This is an exception to the rule against
consideration of events after the valuation date because it confirms management’s
expectations as of the valuation date. While KazAzot never signed the version that
KMG executed, it had previously accepted a materially identical contract and one
could reasonable assume that they would execute the agreement after the
substitution of KMG as the exporter. Claimants explain that “/i]t was, after all,
KazMunaiGas through KazTransGas, not KazAzot, that was to take delivery of
TNG’s export gas and pay the specified export prices under the Tripartite
Agreement. The export provisions in the Agreement were a separate component,
providing for their own discrete gas stream from TNG for export, and providing
their own pricing formula for the payment of international export prices. The fact
that KazAzot might not need the portion of the gas allocated to it in the Tri-Partite
Agreement means only that more of TNG’s gas could be exported, not less.

Respondent cannot now claim that an Agreement it effectively executed itself for
TNG gas exports and export pricing is no evidence of the right, expectation, and
ability to export gas at such pricing.” (C-III {J 12 — 17, partially quoted; CPHB 1
ql 395 — 397, 492 — 494; CPHB 2 {If 346 — 352).

Deloitte’s new arguments demonstrate flaws in and the biased, outcome-driven
nature of its work. Deloitte had every incentive to bias its secondary valuation
analysis to make it appear to support the conclusions it had already published, and
that is exactly what it did. In order to make the secondary analysis support its
previous conclusions, Deloitte made unsupportable judgments and adjustments to
the market data that biased the outcome downward. This is confirmed by the
contemporaneous market analysis conclusions reached by KMG and RBS and the
offers in Project Zenith. Analysis of those market actors, who had no reasons to
bias their conclusions, corroborates FTI’s market analysis. (CPHB 2 {| 340 —
345).

Claimants respond to Respondent’s argument that a price of USD 180 per 1000 m*
is unreasonable and that an undocumented export price of USD 70 would have to
be used, as follows:

19. [...] What Respondent is actually describing appears to be an export gas
racket pursuant to which a State-controlled middle man pays a domestic
producer of gas a reduced price (e.g., US $70), flips the gas at the border
for the international export price (e.g., US $180), and retains the
difference between the two prices. Respondent attempts to put a gloss on
this racket by suggesting that the export prices received by domestic
producers “were regulated by the State and were significantly lower than
[international] export prices due to the lack of any direct entry to
international markets.” Respondent does not, however, cite any
“regulation” supporting this contention, and Claimants invite Respondent
to provide a regulatory basis for this State sponsored profit-skimming
enterprise. And Respondent's reference to a “lack of any direct entry to
international markets” is simply a euphemistic way of saying that a State-
controlled middle man must be paid an illegitimate cut if a domestic
producer wants to export gas. There exists, after all, an otherwise “direct
entry to international markets” in the form of the Center-Asia-Center
pipeline running adjacent to the TNG and KPM oil and gas fields, which
TNG and KPM had a legal right to access at commercially reasonable
rates under their Subsoil Use Contracts. (C-III {J 18 — 19).

Claimants were subject to the “racket” in the past. They were unsatisfied with
these artificially reduced prices for KPM and TNG’s gas exports and consistently
negotiated to acquire reasonable export prices. The Tripartite Agreement set as an
effective benchmark a legitimate export price, tied to the prevailing price at the
border, along with a 20% fee to KMG. (C-III {J 20 — 21).

Respondent also fails to take Kazakhstan’s changing gas market of 2008 into
account, when the demand for gas was breaking Russia’s monopolistic
stranglehold on the export of Kazakh gas. Deloitte cites to reports that support this,
but nonetheless assume 3 scenarios that are premised on whether TNG would be
able to export gas at all. The probability of each of the three scenarios changed
during proceedings, but Deloitte never produced the MOG review upon which

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 336 of 415
Page 335 of 414

those assumptions were allegedly based. Deloitte also ignored the gas pricing
assumptions that were made in connection with the 2009 RBS Asset Assessment,
which contains an 80% likelihood that all of TNG’s gas would be sold on the
export market, although it was cited in their report. RBS valuations of the Tolkyn
field range from USD 527 million to USD 765 million, based on the different
export prices that could be achieved, not on whether TNG would be able to export
gas. This report is fatal to Deloitte’s 5% probability of its “export scenario”, which
is why Respondent instructed Deloitte to remove all references to the RBS
Assessment from its report. (CPHB | {{{[ 491 — 500; CPHB 2 {{{[ 346 — 352).

1552.The RBS valuation was based on (1) the 2009 reserve report prepared by Miller
Lents; (2) detailed legal due diligence by Squire Sanders; (3) detailed financial, tax,
and environmental due diligence by PWC; (4) discussions with management of
KPM and TNG; and (5) “valuation discussions with KMG EP.” It was created as an
independent valuation for the purpose of a potential transaction, not litigation. It
concluded that, on 1 October 2009, the combined enterprise value of Tolkyn,
Borankol, and the LPG Plant was USD 612 million in the Default-Base scenario and
USD 760 in the Special-Base scenario, which assumed higher gas prices. For
Tolkyn and Borankol alone, RBS concluded that Tolkyn and Borankol had a
combined enterprise value ranging from USD 546 million in the Default-Base
scenario, up to USD 784 million assuming higher gas pricing in the Special-Base
Scenario. The Tribunal should increase any amount derived from the RBS
Valuation by USD 243.5 million to account for contingent liabilities attributable to
Kazakhstan that RBS included in its model. Due to the untimely production of the
RBS Valuation, any uncertainty over whether RBS deducted liabilities in its
calculation must be resolved against Respondent. The RBS valuation represents an
alternative valuation which should establish a minimum value for these assets, if the
Tribunal rejects the 14 October 2008 valuation date. The Tribunal should, however,
draw the inference that it understates the value of these assets. (CPHB 1 {583 —
585; CPHB 2 {{{[ 360 — 370).

1553.Respondent selectively embraces parts of the RBS Valuation and ignores others to
argue that the valuation should be adjusted downward. To the extent that
adjustments to the RBS valuation are appropriate, it is that the RBS valuation of
Borankol is mistakenly low. RBS used volume assumptions from the 2009 Miller
& Lents report that were materially higher than GCA’s volume assumptions.
RBS’s valuation as of | October 2009 is less than one-third of Deloitte’s valuation
as of July 2010, when oil prices were higher. For Tolkyn, differences in gas prices
— not condensate volumes — account for the difference between the Deloitte and
RBS valuations. (CPHB 2 {363 — 367).

1554. Deloitte also completely disregards the 2009 RBS Asset Assessment, which was a
comprehensive review of KPM and TNG that RBS prepared for KMG E&P. The
RBS Assessment corroborates FTI’s valuation and undermines Deloitte GmbH’s
conclusions. It concludes that 80% of gas is expected to be exported, that the LPG
Plant will be assumed to have gas from both the Borankol and Tolkyn fields and
from third parties, and that the Contract 302 extension had been granted on 9 April
2009. The RBS report contains six scenarios for valuing KPM and TNG, without
considering the Contract 302 properties, and these range from USD 272 to USD
1,094 million. Although these were significantly higher than the Deloitte GmbH
valuation, it is clear that these erred on the low side. The enterprise values are

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 337 of 415
Page 336 of 414

depressed through the incorrect deduction of contingent liabilities, many of which
were attributable to Kazakhstan’s illegal actions, such as the Laren debt and tax
liabilities. Since Kazakhstan withheld this information until 14 March 2013,
Claimants were unable to question Mr. Suleymenov, who supervised the valuation,
about how these liabilities were deducted. The Tribunal should draw the inference
that they were incorrectly deducted, raising the enterprise value in the RBS
Assessment to USD 855.5 (default base scenario) to USD 1,003.5 million (Special
base scenario). While Deloitte had access to the report, it does not explain the
divergence between its conclusions and those of RBS. Instead, in the Hearing on
Quantum, Mr. Gruhn attempted to distance himself from the RBS Assessment,
saying he had not relied on it. (CPHB 1| {{{[ 513 — 518; CPHB 2 {| 363 — 367).

1555.Regarding Respondent’s arguments and the GCA production forecasts for the
Tolkyn field, Claimants explain that the data GCA reviewed was incomplete.
GCA’s failure to include relevant reserve and production data in its analysis and its
choice of analytic methodology affects the credibility of the report and all reports
that rely on it, including the Deloitte economic analysis. Importantly, GCA did not
include any of the significant “behind-pipe” reserves in the Tolkyn field, provided
in the first Ryder Scott report. These reserves amounted to proven and probable
(2P) reserves of 1,869 MBO and 43.7 BCF of gas as of 14 October 2008. (C-III {{
22 — 25; CPHB 2 {{f[ 335 — 336).

1556. The GCA production forecasts for the Borankol field are also inaccurate. What the
GCA characterizes as “unexplained production increases in 2015 and 2016” in the
Ryder Scott report are actually fully explained forecasted production increases for
that report. Future operations for the Borankol field included 58 well completions
and 4 developed wells to be drilled. Each was supported by complete geologic
analysis, geologic interpretations, log analysis, volumetric analysis, and the
development schedule. (C-III {{{[ 26 — 27).

28. These production increases rey full exploitation of the

reserves in the Borankol field, exploitation that any reasonable operator
would be expected to pursue, and reserves that any reasonable prospective
purchaser would be expected to value. Indeed, Ryder Scott’s estimate of
remaining crude oil and condensate in the Borankol field as of October 14,
2008 was 18.8 million barrels. This is 344% of GCA’s estimate of 5.45
million barrels of remaining crude oil and condensate as of July 21, 2010.
To put this in perspective, cumulative production between October of 2008
and July of 2010 in the Borankol field was approximately 2.3 million
barrels of oil and condensate, which means that GCA’s forecasted future
production ignores 11.05 million barrels of recoverable crude oil and
condensate. GCA does this by simply assuming “a limited work program”
for the Borankol field. GCA does not, however, provide any explanation of
why a limited work program should be assumed, or why otherwise
recoverable reserves should be left in the ground. Simply ignoring without
explanation a vast quantity of recoverable crude oil and condensate is not,
to say the least, a credible method of calculating the fair market value of
an oil and gas field, and calls into serious question the overall credibility
of the reports submitted by GCA and Deloitte. (C-III {ff 28).

1557.GCA modeled the Borankol field as a homogenous reservoir to be drained by
hypothetical, identical, and undisclosed type wells. GCA’s “type well” analysis of

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 338 of 415
Page 337 of 414

the behind pipe reserves likely consisted of GCA’s creation of a hypothetical “rype
well” from undisclosed historical production data. The record contains no evidence
that GCA actually conducted a type well analysis, at all. Ryder Scott’s well-by-
well analysis is more thorough because it considered the behind-pipe potential of
each well, based on the characteristics that had not been completed. In regard to
the Tolkyn field, “Ryder Scott performed a volumetric and performance based
analysis for all of the Borankol and Tolkyn reservoirs, and used the appropriate
data and methodology to estimate the available reserves in the two fields.” There
was no selective bias, as GCA alleges. Ryder Scotts’ estimate of behind pipe and
undeveloped reserves in Borankol and Tolkyn were based on volumetric analysis,
as is appropriate wherer there is no production data. The estimates for producing
reserves in Borankol and Tolkyn were based on well-by-well performance analysis.
For the Tolkyn Artinskian Dolomite, the analysis was based on its material balance
analysis as confirmed by performance data. GCA, however, “inappropriately used
a field wide oil cut versus cumulative production analysis for its Borankol
producing estimates, and did not identify in any discernible way how it estimated
either its Tolkyn behind pipe or producing reserves.” (CPHB 2 {{§ 335 — 336).
Ryder Scott performed a well-by-well analysis, using isochore maps for each
reservoir zone to identify well candidates for recompletion. Ryder Scott then
created a grid summarizing the available and unavailable well bores, just as a
prudent operator would to maximize recover from the lower J-VII reservoir. While
Respondent criticized this at the hearing, Ryder Scott’s assumption that
recompletions would perform strongly was based on a thorough geological analysis
of the reserves. There is nothing about the “bump” in Ryder Scott’s production
profile, since a prudent operator would exhaust production from existing
completions in declining zones before moving to higher zones that have more
remaining productivity. Since GCA incorrectly assumed that recompletions would
not perform strongly and did not schedule individual wells for recompletion, GCA
has created a production profile that reflects a fictional decline curve that no
prudent operator could expect to see. (CPHB | {| 465 — 470).

1558.GCA failed to conduct any volumetric assessment or independent mapping or
analysis of Borankol and Tolkyn, and admitted as much at the end of its Third
Report. For its “other performance-based studies”, presumably the field-wide
decline-curve analysis and the type-well analysis addressed by Ryder Scott, GCA
has not produced its assumptions underlying its type well. GCA’s decline-curve
analysis is “a simplistic extrapolation from field-wide data that ignores State-
caused reasons for low field performance and is an inappropriate method to
estimate future production from behind-pipe reserves.” (CPHB 2 4 332 — 333).

1559.Respondent’s conduct prevented Claimants from promptly addressing water cut
issues. Nonetheless, Respondent’s arguments concerning water production in the
Tolkyn field wells are confused, contradictory, and largely wrong. Ryder Scott
accounted for water cut in its report and found it to be a localized formation
problem and not a field-wide issue. Evidence Respondent provided to Claimants’
on 2 April 2011 supports this finding. (C-III {{{[ 29 — 32).

1560. Respondent argues that over-production in the Tolkyn field in 2007 and 2008
caused the increase in water production in 2009 and 2010, and that Claimants’
recovery should be reduced based on this injury to the field. This is based on the
Neftegazconsult “expert” report, attached as Exhibit R-173. The contentions in

Page 338 of 414

this report are “absurd” and are contradicted by the FDPs and working programs
under which TNG and KPM operated, as well as the history of Tolkyn field
production. In 2007, TNG’s actual gas production from the Tolkyn field was
intentionally 726 mcm less than expected under the Development Plan because
TNG did not have an additional sales contract in place to cover seasonal downturn
during summer domestic demand. The 2008 Development Plan anticipated gas
production of 2500 mcm — an increase of 516 over the expected gas production of
1984 mem, and twice TNG’s actual production of 1257.2 mem. In 2008, TNG’s
actual production was 2352.2 mcm — 147 mem les than expected. The increase in
production created a marginally larger than historical water production, which did
not become apparent until 2009. The Development Plan was reduced from 2500
mem to 1800 mem. In 2009, TNG produced 1317.1 mem, 482.9 mem less than
permissible. As should be readily apparent, there was no “incompliance” on the
part of TNG and no violation of the Development Plans by TNG. This should be
viewed as another attempt for Respondent to excuse or justify seizure of the asset.
(C-III qi 33 — 46).

FTI has dealt with the errors in the CAPEX, OPEX, depreciation, liquidation, and
calculations of inflation and exchange rates contained in the Deloitte and GCA
expert reports. It is clear that in the Deloitte and the GCA Reports, Respondent has
significantly increased the CAPEX and costs in order to decrease the value of the
fields. One example is GCA’s invention of an unnecessary USD 41 million cost to
be included in the Tolkyn field for future compression. As of Respondent’s
valuation date, however, the vast majority of the Artinskian producing wells were
flowing at a tube pressure or above 2000 psig — above the pipeline pressure of
approximately 540 — 680 psig and above the inlet pressure for the Borankol Plant
of 870 psig. Little, if any, compression would be required prior to the expiration of
the Tolkyn Subsoil Use Contract. There is no industry support for increased
pressure to be used to alleviate water production in the Tolkyn field. Further, it is
unclear how Deloitte has applied GCA’s USD 41 million capital expenditure
forecasts in its DCF models, as there is a discrepancy of USD 10.5 million. The
timing with which GCA and Deloitte apply this unnecessary expense also
maximizes it impact and creates the greatest possible reduction in overall value.
(C-III { 47 — 50). An additional argument is best taken from Claimants’ own
words:

Sl. In addition to the unnecessary compression recommended by GCA,
Responde has also bmitted in its Neftegazconsult report a
recommendation that an extensive testing, workover, new drilling, and
directional sidetrack drilling program be commenced in December of 2011
in the Tolkyn field to allegedly address the water issue. Neftegazconsult
does not provide any estimates of the costs or CAPEX for this undoubtedly
costly program of testing and drilling. Neither does Deloitte. Indeed,
Deloitte's report does not reference (or even acknowledge) the
Neftegazconsult report in any way. And in a further indication that GCA’s
alleged compression requirement is itself both unnecessary and a purely
fabricated expenditure, Neftegazconsult does not mention GCA’s alleged
compression requirement anywhere in its report.

52. Neither the compression program put forward by GCA, nor the testing,
workover, and drilling program put forward by Neftegazconsult, would do
anything more to address the water cut issue in the Tolkyn field than the

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 340 of 415
Page 339 of 414

simple reduction in production that the State already incorporated into the
2009 Development Plan. And Respondent's inclusion of these two
different, and enormously expensive, programs to allegedly address the
water cut issue in the Tolkyn field, both intended to commence in 2011,
begs a question: — It is now 2012; were either of these programs
undertaken in 2011, or were they deemed unnecessary? Claimants have
not been able to locate in the documents produced by Kazakhstan any
indication that either program has been commenced, and if they have not,
it is certainly logical to assume that Respondent simply invented them in
order to impose the maximum possible negative impact on a discounted
cash flow analysis and thereby suppress the value of the Tolkyn field. (C-
III J 51 — 52).

1562.GCA’s assumption that compression will be necessary in Tolkyn is based on the
premise that wellhead pressure (varies from well to well), rather than the relevant
bottomhole pressure (the natural force that drives production in the field), will
decline. GCA’s own data regarding bottomhole pressure (the most relevant to the
possible need for future compression) shows that the need for compression should
not be expected prior to 2018. On top of that, GCA manipulated the wellhead
pressure data in Figure 3.1 by reporting only the low point from a range of pressure
readings from each well. (CPHB 2 {{ 337).

1563. Regarding the Tolkyn field, GCA’s inclusion of a front-loaded capital expenditure
for unnecessary compression drives down Deloitte’s DCF valuation for the Tolkyn
field. As conceded by GCA in testimony, no such compression was actually
installed in 2011 and to date, none has been. No one would have expected
compression to be needed in the Tolkyn field as of October 2008 or July 2010,
even though the 2007 KazNIPIMunaiGas FDP contemplated the installation of
compression at Tolkyn in 2012, but contrary to GCA’s insinuation and as latter
admitted by GCA, this was a freely amendable, non-mandatory plan. Further, the
assumption about the installation of compression in the 2007 FDP was based on
production rates that did not occur. GCA cherry picks with respect to this FDP,
citing only that compression would be needed where it increases costs, but holding
the projections for future production based on that plan. Ryder Scott’s analysis
analyzes the production profile and the need for compression as of 14 October
2008, rather than relying on the outdated 2007 FDP. In any event, that some
compression will be required at some point in time is not a justification for a USD
40 million up front expense in the CAPEX calculation for 2011. At the Quantum
Hearing, Mr. Goodearl conceded this point, explaining that a prudent operator
would not install expensive compression to only marginally assist poorly producing
wells. (CPHB 1 {{{[ 471 — 477).

1564. After the Hearings, Claimants argued that the geological and valuation analyses of
FTI and Ryder Scott are more accurate and more reliable than the corresponding
work by Deloitte and GCA. GCA’s valuation is not accompanied by any materials
supporting the summary tables or conclusions in the GCA reports, and GCA
representatives defended this failure to produce by citing commercial
confidentiality. As a result, neither the Tribunal nor Claimants can scrutinize or
verify GCA’s summary assertions or conclusions beyond the wild variations and
cherry picking that was done in their alarmingly lax analysis. The lack of
transparency and failure to document its work (in violation of Art. 5(2)(I) IBA
Rules) strongly suggests that GCA was engaged in an effort to arbitrarily maximize

cost estimates, minimize reserve and production estimates, and accelerate costs
while denying revenues wherever possible. The reliance on “commercial
confidentiality” for GCA’s failure to follow the IBA Rules cannot be taken
seriously. As Mr. Latham for Ryder Scott testified, if a document is confidential,
an expert should not rely on it and should instead locate an alternate source of data.
(CPHB 1 {ff 439 — 444).

Unlike Ryder Scott, GCA performed no independent petrophysical analysis,
seismic analysis, well log analysis, mapping, material balance analysis, or work to
assess the behind-pipe reserves or well recompletions. Without these, there can be
no reliable estimate of the reserves and resources to create a FMV. Instead, GCA
simply reviewed the work performed by Ryder Scott. This is no substitute for an
independent and thorough analysis, like the one provided by Ryder Scott. (CPHB
1 99 447 — 452).

Deloitte relied entirely on GCA in its valuation. It is particularly unusual that
Deloitte would rely on geologists and engineers of GCA for CAPEX and OPEX
estimates, but Mr. Gruhn made it clear at the Hearing on Quantum that this was
done. No effort was made to even compare those numbers to Claimants’ historic
costs. Importantly, all of the CAPEX, OPEX, and production forecast inputs for
Deloitte’s DCF valuations are based entirely on GCA’s opaque, unsupported, and
freely-fluctuating estimates, without verification. (CPHB 1 {{] 445 — 446).

Deloitte TCF’s USD 16 million valuation for the Borankol field and Deloitte
GmbH’s USD 62.8 valuation were products of the summary reference estimates
contained in GCA’s reports, which estimated recoverable oil and condensate
reserves to be only 5.45 million barrels (MBbls), and later 8.65 MBbls.
Inexplicably, GCA cut off the forecast prior to the expiration of the contract. This
forecast is absurd and is contradicted by Ryder Scott’s estimate of 18.8 MBbls of
remaining crude oil and condensate as of 14 October 2008 — 344% of GCA’s initial
estimate of 5.45 MBbls as of 21 July 2010. Production between those dates was
only 2.3 MBbls. GCA initially reached its conclusion by assuming that an
undefined “limited work program” would have applied to Borankol and in the
second report purportedly based it on a review of a FDP (which FDP is unclear).
GCA admitted that the FDP plan had its “shortcomings”, but failed to note that
KPM drilled 21 wells in Borankol after the FDP was prepared, making it severely
outdated. Despite the addition of the behind-pipe recovery, GCA grossly
underestimates the total recoverable reserves by 10.2 MBbls, likely based on its
new methodology, which considers (1) a projected future production from existing
wells based on “oil cut vs. cumulative oil production” and (2) projected production
of behind-pipe reserves from 43 unidentified well recompletions based on a “type
well” analysis. (CPHB 1 §§ 453 — 458; CPHB 2 {[ 334).

The oil cut analysis is not reliable since it does not consider individual well
production characteristics, geophysical characteristics of a reservoir, or volumetric
analysis, all of which Ryder Scott considered. Here, there was a sharp decline in
production form 2009 — 2010, and this was a product of the State’s campaign
against KPM and TNG and Claimants’ decision to minimize exposure. GCA’s
analysis and estimates have a decline curve methodology that do not account for
the production aberrations of 2009 or 2010, or for the enhanced production from a
future re-commencement of completions. GCA ignores this — it acknowledges that

Page 341 of 414

the 2007 FDP called for 45 new wells and 44 completions between 2007 and 2022,
but concludes that the reduction in operations beginning in 2009 was the result of a
reduction in actual recoverable reserves. GCA compounded this error in the
selection of methodology with errors in the actual calculations of oil cuts,
miscalculating the ratio of oil and water because it used a conversion based on
fresh water, when the water in Borankol field is alt water and has a higher specific
gravity than fresh water. As a result, GCA understates recoverable quantities of oil
from existing wells by 15%. (CPHB | {| 459 — 464).

Respondent’s argument that FTI arbitrarily reduced its inflation assumption when it
corrected its price forecasts from nominal to real in order to “limit the impact of the
correction” is wrong for two reasons. First, the reduction was not arbitrary — while
FTI had previously used a historical inflation rate, that rate was not appropriate for
the adjustment of nominal price forecasts into real price forecasts. To make that
adjustment, FTI used a forward-looking inflation rate, which was lower than the
historical rate. To avoid selective bias, FTI incorporated a revised inflation
assumption into its valuation, including in its discount rate determination, raising
that from 13 to 14% and offsetting the allegedly arbitrary inflation rate reduction
on future oil prices. This offset was ignored by Respondent and Deloitte. FTI
rounded the discount rate to the nearest whole number avoid implying false
precision in the estimation of WACC, which Deloitte acknowledges is appropriate.
Deloitte GmbH merely disagrees with the degree of rounding, without support.
Deloitte GmbH’s criticisms of the FTI valuation of Munaibay Oil are mistaken and
are discussed in FTI’s response in the Fourth Report. (CPHB 2 ff 356 — 359).

Contrary to industry practice, Deloitte GmbH failed to test its DCF valuations
against another other indicators of value, including valuations performed by
Deloitte TCF and RBS. FTI, on the other hand, considered six, including: (1) the
Project Zenith indicative offers; (2) trading prices of comparable companies; (3)
reported terms of comparable transaction; (4) trading value of the Tristan debt; (5)
the Cliffson transaction; and (6) the RBS Report. In response to Mr. Gruhn’s
observation that not all of the “comparable” companies in FTI’s analysis were truly
comparable, there are few publically reported companies and transactions in
Kazakhstan involving producers with similar gas resources. The 2008 KMG EP
Report and the 2009 RBS Assessment used many of the same comparable
companies that FTI examined. Claimants respond to Mr. Gruhn’s questioning of
FTI’s analysis of implied enterprise value based on the market value of the Tristan
debt guaranteed by KPM and TNG and his point that one cannot infer that a specific
company has a capital structure that mirrors the industry average. Lenders constrain
the ability of a borrower company to borrow beyond its capacity and markets will
“price-in” risk of maintaining a capital structure that is not in line with the industry.
Mr. Rosen confirmed that, although the Tristan notes were trading at 65% of face
value at the end of September 2008, they were trading at close to face value prior to
the Lehman bankruptcy. FTI’s third report confirms that other oil and gas
companies experienced similar declines. (CPHB 1 {501 - 521).

Deloitte GmbH’s valuation for Borankol, Tolkyn, and the LPG Plant assets is an
outlier, containing unsupported assumptions and higher costs and lower revenues
than other models, and should be disregarded (CPHB 1 [522 — 523).

1572.In light of Mr. Kulibayev’s or the state welfare fund’s Samruk-Kazyna’s control
over Kemikal, Claimants accuse Respondent of interfering with gas sales in an
effort to put pressure on Claimants. Kemikal failed to pay its invoices when due.
(CPHB 1 {{{[ 378 — 383).

1573.Mr. Chagnoux’s testimony regarding the Borankol and Tolkyn fields was also not
credible. (CPHB | {{ 392).

2. Arguments by Respondent

1574. The value of the Borankol field as of 21 July 2010 amounted to USD 62.8 million,
based on the GCA and Deloitte GmbH reports. As of 21 July 2010, the Tolkyn
field has a value of USD 123.2 million, based on the DCF methodology applied by
Deloitte. (R-II {ff 212, 217, 222; RPHB 1 {{{[ 929, 940; RPHB 2 {{{[ 731, 766).

1575.For the Borankol field, GCA estimates that, as of 21 July 2010, gas in the amount
of 94 MMm3 and oil condensate in the amount of 1,185.2 Mtonnes could have
produced until 2022. This plan is based on mapping contained in the FDP and on
the actual production of wells on the valuation date. GCA concluded that most
reservoir units had already produced significant percentages of the estimated and
approved ultimate recoverable reserves, under the FDP. This production was
largely from wells located in the best parts of the reservoir. Recompletions - the
redrilling of a well to a new, usually shallower producing zone when the current
zone is depleted — which are used to access the so-called “behind pipes reserves” —
will be located in poorer regions and will not perform as well. In addition,
historical production figures and high water cut indicate that less reserves than
initially planned in the FDP will be produced. The drilling of new wells is not to
be expected. (R-II { 215 — 216).

1576. Contrary to Claimants’ allegations, GCA has provided supporting documentation,
including two detailed spreadsheets concerning estimated oil and gas production.
GCA made changes to its methodology — changes that were entirely in Claimants’
favor — in its Supplemental Expert Report. GCA accounted for the 34 expected
recompletions, the FDP, and the behind pipe potential. (RPHB 2 {749 — 751).

1577.Claimants allege that GCA has understated the available reserves by 10.2 MMBbIl.
This criticism is misleading and relates to the production that occurred in between
the valuation dates. Claimants’ failure to consider the oil and gas production in the
period between the Parties’ valuation dates leads to an inflation of the available
reserves and, likewise, to an inflation of the value of the field. Further, Claimants
and Ryder Scott assume that 4 new wells and 58 recompletions would be
implemented by the end of 2022. Ryder Scott, however, ignores that
recompletions will be made in poorer regions of the field and will perform worse
than current non-completed wells. Ryder Scott also overestimates the potential for
drilling new wells. (R-II {{{[ 220 — 221; RPHB 2 {| 746 — 748).

1578.Contrary to Ryder Scott’s assumption, GCA has pointed out that there is no
potential for recompletions in the late life of the Borankol field. Instead, GCA
estimates a gradual decline in production. Ryder Scott, however, implicitly
assumes that the field developer would deliberately choose to develop a reservoir
unit only very late in the field life — a highly atypical profile. Ryder Scott’s

1582.

Page 343 of 414

methodology is optimistic, is inconsistent with the data, and shows no
consideration of actual field performance. (RPHB | {[[ 531, 931 — 934).

The J-IA reservoir is the second largest in the Borankol field. Ryder Scott
expected 4.17 MMBbI of its 18.6 MMBbI of recoverable reserves to be recovered
there. Ryder Scott’s analysis of the J-IA reservoir shows how Ryder Scott inflated
the oil in place and the ultimate recovery rates. Ryder Scott also assumed deep oil-
water contacts, meaning the elevation above which oil, rather than water, can be
found in the pores of the rock. Since oil is always above the water (and gas is
always above the oil), a deeper oil-water contact means that a reservoir contains
more oil and less water. GCA showed that Ryder Scott’s assumption of
comparatively deep oil-water contacts was proven incorrect by data from key wells
within the reservoir and was not supported by the FDP drafted under KPM’s
instructions and approved by the Central Commission. Ryder Scott has ignored
this data, specifically for well 78 in the J-IA reservoir, where it placed the oil-water
contact at the middle interval, even though it knew that the specific entire interval
was 100% water saturated. The Tribunal should disregard the Ryder Scott
Borankol production profile and the resulting inflated value. (RPHB | {{{[ 532 —
533, 935 — 939; RPHB 2 {f[ 734 — 739).

At the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Goodearl of GCA unequivocally explained that
water production is a risk that should have been considered in establishing the well
rates. This information was ignored when Claimants ramped up their gas
production for 2008 and thereby ran the risk of permanently damaging the wells
and losing the opportunity to produce gas from the rock matrix in the lower levels
of the reservoir. (RPHB | {{[ 941 — 944).

Another key issue in the composition of the reservoir is the depth of the gas-oil
contact. Deeper gas-oil contacts mean that the reservoir is filled with more gas and
less oil. One hopes for a shallower gas-oil contact, since gas is less profitable than
oil. At the J-IC reservoir, Ryder Scott ignored the available well data that the B13
well penetrating the J-IC reservoir produced for only seven months in 2005 and at a
very high gas-oil ratio, to arrive at their desired, shallower, gas-oil contact. Any
recompletion potential would be limited to less valuable gas. Ryder Scott was also
quite optimistic with the J-IB reservoir. For the J-I reservoir, Ryder Scott estimates
a recovery of 838 Mtonne of oil, ignoring that, until July 2010, that reservoir has
only produced 110 Mtonne. The only conclusions one could draw from this is that
KPM was incompetent and drilled too deeply, or that Ryder Scott’s analysis is
unreliable. There is no evidence to suggest that Ryder Scott has done anything
beyond estimate in place volumes and then apply an unsubstantiated recovery rate
to them. Ryder Scott’s estimates cannot be considered fit for the purpose of
estimating FMV. (RPHB 2 {{[ 739 — 745).

Claimants’ allegation that Ryder Scott’s alleged well-by-well analysis was more
thorough than the type well approach applied by GCA is untenable, as Ryder
Scott’s purported well-by-well analysis ignored available well data and is,
therefore, insupportably optimistic. Claimants have not shown why the use of
historical production data would be inappropriate and would not reflect the
potential of the field. While Respondent disputes that there was a harassment
campaign or that the State caused work reductions in 2009 and 2010, the reductions
do not skew the analysis. There was no change in the decline rate after October

2008 for any of the reservoirs. As demonstrated in the Chart at RPHB 2 {| 759, it is
incorrect that production dropped “incredibly quickly” after Claimants’ valuation
date. Production from the various Borankol reservoirs began to decline in 2003.
(RPHB 2 {{{ 752 — 760). GCA confirmed that Ryder Scott’s insinuation that well
performance deteriorated after Claimants’ effective date is baseless. (RPHB 2 {J
113-116).

There would be a sharp decline in oil production beginning in 2009, brought about
by the end of the contract with TNG’s biggest customer, Kemikal. Kemikal
stopped payments on Claimants’ products because of liquidity and insolvency
issues. (RPHB 2 {[ 124). This information is also disregarded by Ryder Scott. (R-
II { 241 — 245).

Claimants’ criticism that GCA’s type well calculation used an oil cut versus
cumulative production methodology that applied the incorrect water density and
thereby reduced recovery by 15%, is incorrect. GCA never used the oil cut versus
cumulative production method in forecasting production for Borankol. The only
oil cut calculation that Ryder Scott referred to was made as part of the overall
assessment of the field. GCA even made a higher ultimate recovery estimate, 3.1
million tones, than what Ryder Scott thinks GCA’s estimate should be corrected to.
Claimants’ and Ryder Scott’s attacks on GCA are, therefore, unfounded. (RPHB 2
I 761 — 765).

 

 

Regarding the valuation of the Tolkyn field, Deloitte reaches its USD 123.2
valuation by taking three essential factors into account: production profiles,
realistic gas prices, and capital expenditure. Deloitte’s assumptions are based on
GCA’s production profile, according to which gas production reached its peak in
2008 and decreased significantly in 2009. GCA estimates that, until 2018, 60.9
Mtonnes of oil, 574.4 Mtonnes of condensate, and 5.8131 Bem’ of gas may be
produced. In light of Ryder Scott’s comments, GCA increased the total gas sales
by 0.13 Bem*. (R-III {| 222 — 233; RPHB 1 {940 and chart). Ryder Scott and
GCA are not separated by much. As of 21 July 2010, Ryder Scott assumed
recoverable volumes of 66.76 MMBoe. GCA estimate recoverable volumes of
50.3 MMBoe. Claimants exaggerate the difference. (RPHB 2 {{ 485).

Regarding the “behind pipe” reserves in the Tolkyn field, GCA notes that recovery
of such reserves is dependent on the high performance of the wells in the field
during the contract period. Ryder Scott ignores the indicators that suggest a low
recovery rate of the wells, despite claiming to have conducted a well-by-well
analysis for the Tolkyn field. The trend of falling wellhead pressure was apparent
as of 14 October 2008. GCA takes these factors into account. (R-III {fj 234 — 239;
RPHB 1 {[534).

As confirmed by examination at the Hearing on Quantum, Deloitte GmbH
independently created three different scenarios with different gas price
assumptions: “contracts”, “transition”, and “export.” The “contracts” scenario,
estimated at a probability of 65%, would allow companies to sell gas to the
domestic market at defined prices. The “transition” scenario, estimated at a
probability of 30%, considers the MOG’s not-yet-implemented plans to increase
the regulated prices in the domestic market. Under the “export” scenario,
estimated at a probability of 5%, TNG and KPM would export 80% of their

product at international prices and sell 20% in the domestic market. (R-II {{{[ 247 —
252; RPHB | {{{[ 685 — 687).

The “contracts” 65% likelihood estimate is optimistic for Claimants, since subsoil
users cannot simply export gas in Kazakhstan. Even where they are not
contractually prohibited from exporting, they are required to find a purchaser who
has the capacity to get the gas to market. For landlocked Kazakhstan, this is
difficult. For subsoil users, absent an agreement with a Gazprom, gas producers
are bound to deliver gas domestically. Claimants have not argued that KPM or
TNG, at any point, exported gas to Gazprom. FTI, however, completely disregards
domestic gas sales in their export assumption for Tolkyn’s gas. (R-III {{{[ 253 —
362).

Anatolie Stati’s statement regarding a protocol signed by Gazprom and others had
contained a price of USD 160 at the border of Kazakhstan and Russia was incorrect
and referred to a price at the Moldovan border, 2000 km away. Anatolie Stati
frequently changed his position on whether Gazprom was supporting him or was
creating problems in selling gas. (RPHB | {{ 117).

Claimants’ valuations of Tolkyn and Borankol are inflated because they wrongly
assume that a willing buyer would expect KPM and TNG to achieve international
export prices. On the valuation date of 21 July 2010, TNG and KPM did not
export gas and Claimants have not indicated any prospect of exporting gas at that
point in time. TNG’s contractual rights to export and its proximity to the CAC
Pipeline do not give rise to any expectation that TNG would have been able to
export gas. The extent to which indicative offers received by Claimants in Project
Zenith for the Tolkyn field can be relied upon as an indicator for reasonable
expectations regarding the possibility to export gas is questionable. If those
bidders assumed that TNG would be exporting gas, it was because Claimants had
told them in the Information Memo that TNG would be able to export gas. (R-II
I 267 — 268, 338 — 342; RPHB 2 {{{[ 502 — 506).

FTI only arrives at the conclusion that Claimants could export gas and achieve
international prices by relying on the unsigned and undated 2008 Tripartite
Agreement. Neither of the two Tripartite Agreements was signed and, therefore,
neither can serve as a basis to assume export prices. The 17 November 2008
Agreement on which FTI relied cannot show the expected price as of 14 October
2008. Further, based on the events of the time, it could not be expected that
KazAzot would have signed the 17 November 2008 Agreement. (R-I {] 15.7(b); R-
III { 275; RPHB 1 {{{[ 619 — 650; RPHB 2 {| 499).

FTI made numerous errors with regard to the unsigned Tripartite Agreement. FTI
misnamed the parties — it was made between KazAzot, KazTransGas and TNG —
not KazAzot, KMG, and Ascom. Claimants themselves have also misquoted the
recipient of deliveries under this text — it would be KazAzot and KazTransGas and
not KMG. FTI ignored, for example, that the Tripartite Agreement only concerned
gas produced from Tolkyn — no room was made to apply the prices or volumes
considered therein to Contract 302. (R-III {275 — 290, 292; RPHB | {651 — 656;
RPHB 2 {| 499).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 347 of 415
Page 346 of 414

1593.The Undated 2008 Agreement could not have come into force because it could not
be expected that KazTransGas would become the exclusive exporter of Kazakh
gas, as anticipated in para 2.2. This would not have been acceptable to Gazprom,
who wants its 50% affiliate KazRosGas to participate in the export of Kazakh gas.
Gazprom refused to accept KazTransGas as the exporter by letter on 27 October
2008. Neither KazTransGas nor KMG became the exclusive exporter. Even if the
Tripartite Agreement had been signed, it could not have come into force because of
the role of Gazprom. (R-III {[[ 291 — 296; see also R-I {| 15.7(b); RPHB 2 {[ 499).

1594. The Tripartite Agreement represented a bargain — if TNG were to deliver gas to a
strategic project, TNG would have the opportunity to sell gas. The supply of gas
and the export of gas were entirely interdependent. KazAzot wrote to KMG that,
without the fertilizer plant, Claimants could not achieve export prices. In 2008,
however, it could not be expected that KazAzot would have further pursued the
building of the fertilizer plant under the given conditions, which would call for
KazAzot to pay very high domestic prices (USD 100 per 1000 m*). By fall 2008, it
was clear that KazAzot would not be able to pay. Combined with the sharp drop in
the prices for fertilizers, this made the enterprise not profitable for KazAzot. (R-II
ql 297 — 319; RPHB 2 { 499).

1595. It would have been impossible for TNG to fulfill its obligations under the Tripartite
Agreement, bringing it to a likely termination in at least by early 2009. The total
volume demanded under the Tripartite Agreement was 19.25 Bem’ — almost double
the reserves of Tolkyn. For 2012, TNG would have been able to produce less than
half (Ryder Scott) or, more correctly, a little more than one third (GCA) of the
amount required. TNG’s inability to deliver would have been to the detriment of
KazAzot, which could have terminated the contract under Section 10.1 for failure
to perform. Due to distribution priorities, TNG would not have been able to
export. TNG would first have needed to deliver gas to KazAzot, and then to the
domestic market before the remaining gas be able to be exported. Under the
scenarios, TNG could not have even met its obligation to KazAzot. (R-II {{] 320 —
337; RPHB 2 {| 499).

1596. Having received a report clearly setting out the available reserves in April 2008,
Claimants must have known that they would be unable to fulfill the contract or to
export when negotiating the Tripartite Agreement. The use of the 2 agreements in
valuation is belied by Claimants’ actions, which demonstrate that they never
believed that the Tripartite Agreement would go into effect. Even when evaluating
his own assets, Anatolie Stati instructed Miller Lents to estimate the net oil,
condensate, gas, gas plant liquid reserves, and future net reserves based on prices
that were far lower than envisioned in the Tripartite Agreement. During both
hearings, Anatolie Stati made it clear that he did not believe in the viability of the
KazAzot project. He agreed that a Tripartite Agreement that is only signed
between 2 parties has no value. He stated: “J’m sorry, it’s not signed. It’s not
signed by anyone. Why should we look into it?” (RPHB 2 {| 501; RPHB 1 {| 657 —
668).

1597. Regarding CAPEX, the cost of USD 40 million for the installation of compression
on the Tolkyn field needs to be taken into account. Compression is necessary to
alleviate water production and to remedy the declining pressure on many of the
wells. Without compression, gas cannot enter the CAC pipeline. Furthermore, the

Third GCA Expert Report shows that compression would be necessary to avoid
shutting wells in. At the Hearing on Quantum, Claimants wrongly alleged that no
independent research by Deloitte had been done to prove that USD 40 million in
compression installation would be required. Deloitte relied on the GCA expertise
for that figure, and GCA has the expertise to conclude that compression would be
necessary and to estimate its cost. GCA did not arrive at their opinion merely
based on the FDP, which demonstrates that Claimants recognized that compression
would be necessary as they were running the field. Mr. Goodearl’s testimony at
the Hearing on Quantum and the GCA Supplemental Expert Report expressed the
need for compression as being required due to declining well head pressures. The
Third GCA Expert Report also shows that compression would be necessary to
avoid shutting the wells in. In addition, considering Claimants’ instruction to
Miller Lents, Claimants have also assumed that compression would be necessary
and this was confirmed by testimony as the hearing. GCA predicted that
compression would be necessary by 2011, the same as in the FDP, based on the
actual pressure decline in the reservoir. The need for compression was foreseeable
as at 14 October 2008, since wellhead pressure significantly declined starting in the
second half of 2007. The PwC Due Diligence Report also identified the necessity
of compression and estimated the costs at USD 55 million. The fact that KMT has
not yet installed compression does not disprove the necessity of compression — the
non-installation has led to a significant decrease in production. (R-II { 263;
RPHB 1 {{{[ 946 — 972; RPHB 2 {766 — 770, 774 — 780).

GCA never stated that there was a “fall back” that only some compression would
be needed at some point in time. Rather, GCA has firmly stated that compression
would need to be installed by 2011/2012. Unlike Ryder Scott, who completed a
static analysis, GCA focused on the trends and rates of pressures. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 771
—773).

Claimants themselves assumed that USD 65 million in infrastructure capital
expenditure for Tolkyn from 2010 — 2012 when they were operating it. They have
failed to provide any justification for why they now want to apply zero costs for
infrastructure for Tolkyn. (RPHB 2 {J 781 — 782).

Claimants’ valuations of the Tolkyn and Borankol are inflated by FTI’s unrealistic
and unachievable price assumption of USD 180 per 1000 m3 of gas at the valuation
date. The only company achieving such prices were KazRosGas — a company 50%
owned by Gazprom. Claimants also misquote the government’s statement that an
increase in price could be possible — there are no set plans to raise prices to USD
306. Domestic prices are set by the ARNM. (R-III {{] 343 — 353; R-I J 49.13;
RPHB 1 1945).

Claimants’ export price assumptions are incorrect and have no correlation to the
prices actually paid for the export of gas. They are based on the Yenikeyeff
Report, which Prof. Olcott demonstrated is unverifiable. FTI assumes more than
twice what RBS assumes for the export price, USD 180 per 1000 cm rather than
USD 85 per 1000 cm, respectively. RBS’s price of USD 85 per 1000 cm is
consistent with prices paid by Gazprom to KazRosGaz, which was USD 110 for
1000 cm in 2008. (RPHB | {{{[ 688 — 697; RPHB 2 {{]] 507 — 508).RBS agreed with
Prof. Olcott’s assumptions for a valuation on a stand alone basis. (RPHB 2 {f{[ 513
— 520).

1602. Anatolie Stati instructed Miller Lents to apply the prices of USD 49 per 1000 m3
for 2009, up to USD 115 for 2018. The price of approximately USD 70 per 1000
m3 is the export price that GasTradeInternational received. It is clear that
Claimants never considered FTI’s USD 180 per 1000 m* to be a reasonable price.
(R-II {iff 355 — 365).

1603. With respect to 14 October 2008, TNG did not even export gas at that time, but
rather sold the majority of its gas to Kemikal. Kemikal stopped payments in 2008
due to liquidity and insolvency issues. (RPHB 2 { 124). The Yenikeyeff Report
also does not support Claimants’ claim that export could be expected or that
European prices could be obtained. As dissatisfying as the inability to export may
have been, this is what Claimants bargained for when entering the Kazakh market.
They were not treated less favorably than other market players. Although the
contracts provided Claimants the “right” to export gas, that did not guarantee an
export market or export prices. The Republic was not responsible for finding a
buyer or for guaranteeing transit. Anatolie Stati’s alleged belief that he was also
guaranteed a market is not supported by the contracts. (R-III { 354; RPHB 1 {J
597 — 612, 669 — 671).

1604.The RBS valuation report conducted as part of the KMG EP Due Diligence in
September 2009 and which Claimants consider to have been prepared by “world
class experts” is a draft report. It focuses on what the assets would be worth if
added to KMG EP’s portfolio, not if owned by Claimants. It contains no
documentation or reasoning. It is based on a valuation date that does not
correspond to the legal considerations of this case. It has numerous
inconsistencies. The RBS Report may serve the Tribunal to verify Deloitte
GmbH’s work. (RPHB 2 ff 809 — 810).

1605. The RBS proves that Claimants’ valuation of the LPG Plant, and other assets, are
bogus. Liquids can be sold for considerably higher prices than gas. Miller Lents
assumes a high potential for the production of liquids, The Parties experts agree,
however, that these high liquids reserves estimates are unsupported by the data.
The RBS valuation for Claimants’ Borankol claim is disproportionate since it
relied on gas, rather than oil prices. Since Borankol is an oil producing field, it is
only worth approximately one tenth of the USD 197 million suggested by
Claimants. The RBS valuation also proves that Claimants exaggerated their
Tolkyn claim in that it arrives at a comparable value to that estimated by FTI,
despite the fact that RBS applied more optimistic reserves estimates than either
Ryder Scott or GCA presented. RBS reached this result not by applying the
numbers from GCA or Ryder Scott (which would have resulted in a lower value),
but instead by relying on the reserve estimates of Miller Lents as of 1 January
2009. (RPHB | {ij 986 — 987, 991 — 995; RPHB 2 {ff 823 — 824).

1606.The RBS valuation supports Deloitte GmbH’s valuation of USD 123.2 million.
The only asset that brings the RBS valuation anywhere near the FTI valuation is
the RBS’s valuation of the Tolkyn field. In the “KMG EP Base Case Scenario”,
RBS assumed a value of USD 327 million for the Tolkyn field, to which USD 200
were added as the 80% export sales. It is undisputed that RBS applied the
production estimates from the Miller & Lents 2009 report to arrive at its asset
value. That report assumes an aggregate oil and condensate production that
dramatically exceeds both experts’ assumptions, without providing sources or

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 350 of 415
Page 349 of 414

reasoning. The overstated production projection accounts for a difference of USD
203 million. If RBS had applied the production estimates of GCA, they would
have arrived at a value for the Tolkyn field below the USD 123.2 million, as
calculated by Deloitte GmbH. Had RBS applied Ryder Scott’s production
estimates, the value would fall below FTI’s Tolkyn value. (RPHB 2 4] 509 — 512;
782 — 797, 821 — 823).

1607.RBS added USD 200 million to the Tolkyn value for the assumption that 80% of
the gas would be exported. RBS, however, has agreed with Respondent’s
arguments as to why TNG and KPM could not have been expected to be exporting
gas at the valuation date or later. RBS, thus, only assumed the export portion based
on the assumption that KPM EP would purchase the assets and would, thus, benefit
from the synergy effects of a major oil and gas producer in Kazakhstan. On a
stand-alone basis, KPM and TNG could only sell at domestic process. Thus, for
evaluating the stand along value of Tolkyn, the export of gas cannot be assumed.
(RPHB 2 {{{[ 509 — 512; 798 — 802, 811 — 820).

1608.The RBS valuation did not include contingent liabilities in the working capital.
Thus, there is no justification for Claimants’’ addition of USD 243.5 million. RBS
deducted USD | million from the aggregate asset value in the Best Case Scenario
and USD 20 million in the Special Case Scenario to reflect changes in working
capital. Claimants, however, simply allege that the RBS report incorrectly
deducted contingent liabilities, and that this should be added back to arrive at the
FMV. The items listed as contingent liabilities in the RBS Report would
conventionally be considered working capital items. The deducted USD 1 million
and 20 million are far below the level of contingent liabilities that Claimants’
assume. RBS deducted the respective USD | and 20 million from the aggregated
asset value because they assumed that over the lifetime of the assets, the required
working capital would increase by USD | million (discounted). (RPHB 2 {{{[ 839 —
852).

1609. Deloitte GmbH conducted a hypothetical case to test Claimants’ allegations and
found that, if true, RBS would have assumed that the working capital would
decrease by USD 242.5 or USD 223.5 over the life of the assets. That was
logically not possible, however, since the combined working capital of KPM and
TNG as of 31 March 2009 only amounted to USD 157 million. (RPHB 2 {| 853 —
858).

1610. There was also no basis to assume that projected capital expenditure may contain
contingent liabilities. Deloitte has checked the RBS report figures against the
figures in the Miller & Lents 2009 report and the PwC Due Diligence Report on
which RBS based its capital expenditure estimates. If RBS had factored any
contingent liabilities into the capital expenditure, the RBS figures would be
different from the Miller & Lents and PwC figures. They were not. Likewise,
there is no basis for Claimants’ assumption that operating expenses or tax expenses
may contain contingent liabilities. The double counting of capital expenditure can
be excluded, as there is no evidence that capital expenditure may have been
deducted in both the DCF and the working capital. (RPHB 2 {| 859 — 864).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 351 of 415
Page 350 of 414

1611.Deloitte’s cc bl and ble tr analyses
corroborated Deloitte’s valuation results in their DCF analysis. (RPHB | §{ 1022
— 1023). Respondent explains the evaluation process as follows:

1024. A comparable companies analysis is conducted by first identifying a group
of comparable companies whose shares are publicly traded. The more
comparable the companies are, the more reliable the analysis will be. In
the next step, the 2P reserves of these companies in barrels of oil
equivalent (boe) are set in a relation to their enterprise value, with the
enterprise value being determined based on the market price of shares and
debt instruments of the companies as of the valuation date. The result are
so-called “multiples”. The 2P reserves of the asset in question, in this case
the Borankol and Tolkyn fields, can then be multiplied with these multiples,
leading to a value estimate. The basis of this method is the assumption that
2P reserves of liquids and gas are the main value driver in the oil and gas
industry. (RPHB I ¥ 1024).

1612. The comparable companies analysis based on GCA’s 2P reserve estimates as of 21
July 2010 resulted in a combined asset value of the Borankol and Tolkyn fields of
USD 96.6 million. The comparable transactions analysis based on the same
resulted in a combined asset value of USD 216.1 million. These show that the FTI
comparable companies and comparable transactions analyses for the Borankol and
the Tolkyn fields for 14 October 2008 were overstated. Deloitte GmbH prepared
their own companies and comparable transactions analyses based on Ryder Scott’s
reserves estimates and showed markedly lower values than the USD 675.9 million
that FTI calculated in their DCF analysis. Deloitte GmbH’s comparable companies
analysis leads to a combined asset value of USD 169.6 million, or 25% of FTI’s
DCF calculated value and their comparable transactions analysis leads to a
combined asset value of USD 277.8 million or 40% of FTI’s DCF calculated value.
FTI’s calculations are massively overstated because (1) they use pre-financial crisis
data without adjustment, (2) the used incomparable companies, and (3) they failed
to find a company that was actually comparable. (RPHB | {[{[ 588 — 590, 1026 —
1028).

1613.In the Second Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent demonstrated this by way of charts.
Assuming the reserves as provided by Ryder Scott, the FTI valuation is the far
outlier, and Deloitte GmbH’s analysis was methodologically correct and within
range. The FTI valuation based on the Cliffson transaction was widely outside of
range. (RPHB 2 {[ 874 — 880).

1614. Regarding Claimants’ complaints regarding the multiples used for comparable
companies ignores the inconsistencies in the multiples provided by RBS, numbers
which even Renaissance Capital found to be inappropriate. If one applies the three
transactions quoted by RBS that are the most relevant for Claimants’ valuation
date, one arrives at the average multiple of 2.17, which is less than one third of
FTI’s average comparable transaction multiple of 6.83. Applying the multiple of
2.17 to the 2P reserves assumed by Ryder Scott on 14 October 2008, one arrives at
a value of USD 212 million for Borankol and Tolkyn, which is less than one third
of the value alleged by FIT based on their DCF analysis. (RPHB 2 {{[ 881 — 882).

FTI’s calculations were flawed due to their use of an overstated multiple of about
6.98 for the comparable companies analysis, and 6.83 for the comparative
transactions. This stands in stark contrast to the 2.3 multiple that Renaissance
Capital used during Project Zenith on 27 September 2008, or the 2.99 that
Renaissance Capital described on 31 October 2008 to represent the effects of the
financial crisis. (RPHB 1 {| 1029).

3. The Tribunal

As mentioned above in this Award, for each of its damage calculations, the
Tribunal has to take into account that, above in this Award, it came to the
conclusion that the correct valuation date for the calculation of damages in this
case is 30 April 2009. Contrary to that finding, the Parties have primarily relied on
a different valuation date for their respective calculations of damages, i.e.
Claimants on 14 October 2008, Respondent on 21 July 2010. Therefore, first, the
Tribunal has to examine whether the Parties’ arguments regarding the calculation
of damages can still be applied to the evaluation date found to be applicable by the
Tribunal.

The Parties agree that the DCF methodology is an appropriate method of
calculation. The Tribunal agrees as well, as this method has been used in many
comparable cases and decisions of other Tribunals. This Tribunal sees no reason
not to apply it here. The Tribunal now turns to the issues of application of that
method disputed between the Parties and their experts.

After evaluation of the timeline of events summarized above in the chapter on
causation, the Tribunal accepts Claimants’ argument that Respondent’s conduct,
which was found above to be a breach of the ECT, including the liquidity shortage
insofar as it was also caused by Respondent, forced Claimants to reduce
development efforts at Borankol and Tolkyn fields and that, in particular, this
caused Claimants to decide not to drill or recomplete 13 wells at Borankol and
Tolkyn in 2009 — 2010.

In this context, the Tribunal considers that Claimants have provided sufficient
proof for three kinds of damages: (1) KPM and TNG lost revenue that they would
have earned from their planned production; (2) the gap in the development efforts
depressed the production curve at Tolkyn and Borankol more than it would have
been, had Claimants been able to develop the fields without Respondent’s
breaching conduct, and (3) Claimants were unable to sufficiently respond to the
watering issues at the Tolkyn field.

Regarding valuation, as mentioned above, most of Respondent’s arguments and
their experts’ calculations rely on the unacceptable valuation date 21 July 2010
and, therefore, cannot correctly be used for a calculation of the value of the
investment at the correct valuation date before Respondent’s breaching conduct
had their impact on the value of the investment.

Insofar as Respondent refers to an earlier valuation date, the Tribunal is not
persuaded by Respondent’s argument (RPHB 2 p.17) that relies on the report of its
experts, Deloitte GmbH, that financial difficulties of KPM and TNG even before

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 353 of 415
Page 352 of 414

October 2008 were causes. The Tribunal finds no convincing evidence that the
above damages would have occurred absent Respondent's interference.

1622. In particular, before Respondent’s interference, it could be expected that export of
gas would be possible. The CAC Pipeline — a direct export route — is proximate to
the Tolkyn field. At the time, Respondent was forecasting both an expansion of
total gas production from 33.7 Bem’ in 2008 to 61.5 Bem’ by 2015, with a
concomitant export volume expansion from 6.2 Bem in 2008 to 12.9 Bem’ in 2015.
Claimants’ right to export gas is relevant to TNG’s and its prospective purchaser’s
reasonable expectations as of 14 October 2008. The Tripartite Agreement confirms
that TNG would be able to export gas. As Respondent itself rightly points out, the
Tripartite Agreement represented a bargain — if TNG were to deliver gas to a
strategic project, TNG would have the opportunity to sell gas. KMG executed the
17 November 2008 Agreement, giving its clear indication that gas exports could be
presumed to be available to a prospective purchaser upon entry into negotiations
with KMG, regardless of the KazAzot fertilizer project. The Tribunal is not
persuaded by Respondent’s argument that an Agreement it effectively executed
itself for TNG gas exports and export pricing is no evidence of the right,
expectation, and ability to export gas. The non-implemantation of the Agreement
was part of and due to the Respondent’s conduct found to be in breach of the ECT.
The same is true for Respondent’s argument that there would have been be a sharp
decline in oil production beginning in 2009, brought about by the end of the
contract with TNG’s biggest customer, Kemikal. As suggested by Respondent
itself, Kemikal stopped payments on Claimants’ products because of liquidity and
insolvency issues, but, as also discussed earlier in this Award, this discontinuance
of payments was caused by Respondent’s own breaching actions.

1623. Regarding the prices that could reasonably be expected, the Tribunal considers that
Claimants have not fulfilled their burden of proof for the price of USD 180 they
allege. Claimants instructed Miller Lents for the 2009 Report, which is closest to
the valuation date accepted by this Tribunal, to apply a base price of USD 2.00
starting from the year 2009, which translates into about USD 70 per 1000m.
(Miller Lents Report 2009 Attachment | Exhibit 349). This price of USD 70 is also
the export price GasTradeInternational LLP received. (R-III {| 364). The Tribunal,
therefore, considers that a price of USD 70 is appropriate for its calculation of
damages.

1624. Regarding the resulting calculation of damages, the Parties have relied on the
various expert reports provided to them and at various times. For the reasons given
above, this Tribunal can only rely on those of these reports that use a valuation date
of or close to 30 April 2009. In this context, the Tribunal considers that, rather than
making an attempt to replace calculations of such expert reports by its own
calculations, it is more appropriate to compare these reports and, if one is
considered sufficiently convincing, to rely on that report. As Claimants have the
burden of proof for the damages they allege, first the expert reports submitted from
Claimants’ side are considered.

1625. Of these, the Tribunal considers that the Ryder Scott reports on reserves estimates
are convincing in their approach and results. However, based on these reserves
estimates, the Tribunal finds that the FTI calculations provided by Claimants are
less convincing and are considerably overstated for the reasons provided in more

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 354 of 415
Page 353 of 414

detail by Respondent (RPHB | sections E to H, particularly H.I]) and do not
sufficiently fulfill Claimants’ burden of proof. On the other hand, since in fact
damages have been caused, the Tribunal considers that their calculation can be
based on the alternative damage calculations conceded by Respondent, if its own
valuation date is not accepted, for the valuation date of 14 October 2008 (RPHB 1
§§ 1027 et seq.) by referring to Deloitte’s comparable transactions analysis, also
based on the Ryder Scott Reports, leading to a combined asset value of USD 277.8
million.

1626. This is, therefore, the value that the Tribunal accepts as the correct damages.
L.V. Quantum Related to Contract 302 Properties
1. Arguments by Claimants

1627. Kazakhstan interfered with the exploration of the Contract 302 area. When TNG
informed MEMR on 10 October 2008 that it no longer wished to enter into the
appraisal phase but instead wanted a two-year extension on the exploration
contract, TNG explained that it based that decision on the belief that the Contract
302 area had significant potential in deep-lying raw reservoirs and that TNG
desired to more fully explore it. Mr. Lungu confirmed at the Hearing on Quantum
that this referred to the Interoil Reef. The 14 October 2008 extension request and
proposed work program indicated this intent and showed a planned drilling depth
of 6000m and a second ultra-deep well on the subsalt horizon. While TNG could
have penetrated the Interoil Reef structure by deepening the Munaibay-1 well
rather than drilling a second exploration well, the work program could have been
amended later to include more wells, like the second ultra-deep well, the Munaibay
No. 3. The 3D seismic data showed that the Munaibay-1 well was in a good
position to explore the Interoil Reef, although it lay somewhat deeper than the
originally planned depth (6750m per Ryder Scott, 6300m per GCA). TNG had the
capacity to explore the Contract 302 area, including the Interoil Reef — it only
stopped drilling at 4700m because it encountered pressures that required a heavier
rig. Claimants acquired a rig with a depth capacity of 7000m in Georgia and it was
ready for transport in January 2009. Claimants declined to move the rig to
Kazakhstan after the State commenced its harassment campaign, opting instead to
resolve disputes with the MEMR before prudently continuing investment in the
Contract 302 area. Kazakhstan’s harassment campaign and ultimate refusal to
formally extend Contract 302 prevented further exploration work on the area.
(CPHB 2 {| 228 — 232). Mr. Chagnoux’s testimony demonstrated that Kazakhstan
interfered with Claimants’ sale efforts by preventing them from proving resources
in the Interoil Reef structure. (CPHB {{{[ 393 — 394).

1628.But for Kazakhstan’s harassment campaign, TNG would have penetrated the
Interoil Reef before Contract 302 was set to expire on 30 March 2009. As Mr.
Romanosov testified, it would reasonably take six months to drill one well into the
Interoil Reef structure. (CPHB 1 {{{[ 369 — 377).

1629.In its First Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants valued the Contract 302 properties as
follows (CPHB 1 {| 557):

Regarding the Munaibay Oil claim, Claimants seek an award of USD 96,808,000,
based on the DCF calculations performed by FTI, which relied on the geological
analysis of Ryder Scott. It is undisputed that the DCF method is appropriate for
valuing this asset. (CPHB | {| 524 — 527).

Claimants’ claim for the undrilled Contract 302 properties (excluding Munaibay
Oil) is based on (1) their out-of-pocket investment costs, plus (2) a portion of the
prospective value they could have realized if Respondent had not denied them the
opportunity to make a commercial success of the project. This is not a claim for
lost profits. FTI conducted the appropriate DCF calculation, which included
updates and adjustments to the crude oil and condensate sales mix and liquids
prices, transportation expenses effecting its liquid price assumptions, and
infrastructure CAPEX. This DCF calculation showed the unrisked prospective
value of the Contract 302 properties as USD 1.58 (C-III { 78 (stating LPG Plant
rather than Contract 302); C-III J 61).

To assess the Munaibay Oil, Ryder Scott analyzed the available seismic data and
performed a thorough independent analysis to project a total recovery of 53.285
MBDbIs of oil and a need for a total of 75 development wells and one exploration
well. This stands in stark contrast to GCA’s “finger-in-the-wind” methodology,
which drastically changed between the first and second reports and resulted in a
development plan that (1) needed more wells for less oil and (2) increased the
project CAPEX to USD 828 million and total OPEX to USD 188.5 million, thereby
summarily wiping out the USD 68 million that Deloitte TCF had originally
attributed to Munaibay Oil based on GCA’s first report. GCA does not specifically
state its reasons for drastically changing its analysis. Additionally, GCA
compounded its errors by baselessly front-loading the development costs while
delaying the assumed production and revenues. (CPHB | {{{[ 478 — 484).

Respondent’s de minimis USD 68 million is wholly inappropriate. It recognizes
only the value in the Munaibay Main gas resources and ignores most of the
Contract 302 properties, including the Munaibay North, Bahyt, and Interoil Reef
resource areas. That these properties should have no value is belied by the fact that
Respondent has entertained bids for the Contract 302 properties, among others,
after seizing them. (C-III {{] 61 — 62).

Deloitte’s calculations use the ECOS, GCOS, and Risked Capital values supplied
by the GCA, which provided no explanation for how GCA derived the ECOS

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 356 of 415
Page 355 of 414

factors. Nevertheless, FTI — using these same values — made its own calculation of
the value of the Munaibay Main oil, and arrived at USD 153 million. (C-III { 63).

1635.The GCOS is whether a well will produce a sustained flow of hydrocarbons. There
can only be one GCOS for a project. The GCOS, according to GCA, is 10%. This
is reasonable and not particularly low for a prospect of this size. GCA and Ryder
Scott differ primarily in their estimations of the size of the reservoir. By
examining the horizons around the Interoil Reef structure, Ryder Scott was able to
provide an image of the reef with a high degree of confidence. GCA, on the other
hand, had to force or “ghost” the analysis. (CPHB 2 ff] 382 — 385).

1636.GCA assumes a protracted and unreasonable exploration schedule that could not be
accomplished by the exploration deadline of March 2011. GCA also assumes that
additional 3D seismic would be required to assess the prospect before drilling.
Additional 3D seismic is, however, unnecessary. While additional 3D seismic may
be helpful to determine whether there is a trap, that could be better tested by
drilling, as a prudent operator would. As Ryder Scott concludes, assuming that
TNG had been able to use the deep drilling rig that Claimants acquired in 2008,
there were no safety or engineering obstacles to drilling an exploratory well in the
Interoil Reef Structure. (CPHB | {{ 485 — 486).

1637. Although Claimants spent USD 43 million exploring the Contract 302 property,
this work was truncated by the State, making it difficult express the values with
certainty. Nevertheless, and as Respondent is aware, prior to the seizure,
“Claimants had already successfully test drilled the Tabyl and Munaibay resource
areas, conducted seismic work in the Tabyl West, Munaibay North, Bahyt, and
Interoil Carboniferous Reef resource areas, and commenced a test well in the
Bahyt resource area that has log data to approximately 3950 meters.
Furthermore, the Tabyl West and Munaibay North resource areas are immediately
proximate to the already successfully drilled Tabyl Main and Munaibay Main
resource areas, which, as explained in the geology report (Exhibit 4)
accompanying Ryder Scott’s First Report, significantly increases their geological
chance of success.” (C-III { 56).

1638. Although the valuation of the Contract 302 properties presents a greater challenge
than the Tolkyn and Borankol fields, this is due to Respondent’s wrongdoing. The
benefit of the doubt belongs to Claimants as the victims and not to Respondent as
the wrong-doer. Respondent continues to have full possession of the areas in
question and “should not be permitted to sit on these Contract 302 Properties
without paying for them until the Tribunal renders an award that minimizes their
value, and then prove by development the actual value of the bargain that it
illegally acquired.” (C-III { 57).

 

1639. Where it can be proven that the claimant has suffered a loss and the respondent has
committed a legal wrong causing that loss, the respondent is not entitled to invoke
burden of proof as to the amount of compensation for such loss to the extent that it
would defeat the claimant’s claim for compensation. Rather, in such a situation,
the claimant need only provide a basis upon which the Tribunal can, with
reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss. (C-III { 59). Respondent
has conceded that there was at least a loss of USD 68 million in relation to the

Contract 302 properties. As a loss has been conceded, only the quantum of that
loss remains to be determined. (C-III {[ 60).

Respondent’s objection to the economic feasibility of the project is the potential for
H2S contamination. GCA and Deloitte unreasonably assume a 100% chance of
significant H2S contamination, despite having no knowledge of whether that gas is
present. It is more reasonable to assume that the gas is not present, as the reason
that TNG did not drill the exploration will that would have demonstrated the
quality of the gas is Kazakhstan’s illegal conduct. The infrastructure cost
attributable to H2S contamination accounts for nearly half of GCA’s estimated
USD 2 billion CAPEX. This is problematic because there is no geological basis
for GCA’s opinion that H2S is present. GCA bases those assumptions on the
Tengiz and Kashgan fields, which are 45 and 145 km away from the Interoil Reef,
respectively. There is no reason to believe that H2S generating source rocks are
present in the Interoil Reef structure. Second, the comparison to the Tengiz and
Kashagan fields is inapposite, since those have very different fluid characteristics
than the Interoil Reef. The Tolkyn field is likely the closest analog for estimating
the composition of the Interoil Reef gas, which is what Ryder Scott used. (CPHB 1
ql 485 — 490, 556; CPHB 2 {[ 385).

Respondent has prevented Claimants from drilling the necessary exploration wells
that would establish the extent of damages in the undrilled Contract 302 area.
Thus, at the outset, Respondent should be precluded from arguing whether H2S
contamination would be an issue, since Respondent prevented the drilling.
Holding Claimants to a standard of reasonable certainty would be unfair, and
international law gives the Tribunal to award damages that Claimants cannot
establish with certainty. Claimants and FTI have never attempted to mislead the
Tribunal about the certainty of their damages, and have clearly stated that their
prospective valuation for the Contract 302 properties is an unrisked valuation, and
Respondent’s comments to the contrary are mere bluster. (CPHB 1 §{ 528 — 533).

Regarding Respondent’s criticisms for well and infrastructure costs for the
Contract 302 properties, FTI explained that it based its cost estimates for the
Contract 302 properties on information provided by Claimants and discussed with
Ryder Scott and confirmed against Claimants’ historical experience. For the
future, FTI forecasted well costs for deeper wells based on the same. (CPHB 2 {[{[
352 — 353).

Finally, although Respondent made a number of misstatements and manipulations to
support its argument that the RBS valuation corroborates Deloitte’s valuation, the
RBS valuation corroborates the FTI valuation. RBS did not value the Contract 302
properties — it did not, as Respondent argues, assign a zero value to the properties.
KMG EP did not value the Contract 302 properties because, due to Respondent’s
wrongful action, Claimants could not provide any exploration data for Contract 302
to KMG EP. (CPHB 2 {[ 362).

Tribunals, most prominently the Sapphire International v. NIOC but also AIG
Capital Partners, Inc. and CJSC Tema Real Estate Co. v. Kazakhstan, SPP v.
Egypt, Lemire v. Ukraine, and SOABI v. Senegal, have awarded damages for the
concept of loss of opportunity, even where damages cannot be proven with
reasonable certainty. It has been recognized that it is exceptionally rare that lost

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 358 of 415
Page 357 of 414

profits or opportunity can be precisely calculable. It is, therefore, appropriate to
calculate these on the basis of a hypothetical maximum loss. Respondent’s
attempts to distinguish Sapphire are meaningless — that tribunal awarded out-of-
pocket expenses, plus a portion of the amount that the investor could have earned
based on the investor’s estimate of best-case-scenario income. In Sapphire, unlike
here, the claimant had performed no drilling or seismic work. This Tribunal could
use Sapphire as a precedential guide and find that there is certainly enough
evidence to determine the existence and extent of damage. In AIG, the tribunal
awarded the 30% return that Claimants expected to earn on the full USD 16.3
million, less interest of 6% on the USD 12.74 million that those claimants never
actually invested. The tribunals in AJG and Gemplus also rejected the DCF
method, since the investment was an income generating activity. (C-I {J 424 —
429, C-III { 50, CPHB 1 {{{[ 534 — 536, 539 — 548).

1645.That the Sapphire decision was expressly decided according to the tribunal’s ex
aequo et bono powers simply means that it was a matter of discretion. The
Gemplus and Talsud v. Mexico tribunal confirmed that arbitrators have the
discretion to award damages for loss of opportunity, even without reference to ex
aequo et bono powers. Gemplus also observed that the concept of damages for loss
of chance/opportunity is recognized in many national legal systems (CPHB | {if
543 — 548).

1646. The only case that Kazakhstan cites for the rejection of the concept of damages for
loss of opportunity is the inapposite Chevron v. Ecuador. There, the respondent
argued that the award had to be reduced by the likelihood of the claimant
prevailing on the court cases underlying the claim. Although that tribunal noted
that the loss of opportunity doctrine does not have wide acceptance across legal
systems, it observed that it exists in exceptional circumstances where such harm
would be difficult to quantify, which was not the situation in that case. Indeed, the
Chevron v. Ecuador and Lemire v. Ukraine cases show that the loss of opportunity
doctrine exists for those situations where the claimant cannot show that its
likelihood of success is greater than 50% - if it were greater than that, Claimants
would be able to recover the full amount of lost profits without discounting for
likelihood of success. Finally, even the scholar cited by Kazakhstan, Prof. Marboe,
concludes that there are circumstances for which an award of damages for loss of
opportunity is appropriate. (CPHB 1| {| 549 — 552).

1647. Applying the law on loss of opportunity to the Contract 302 prospect, there is
ample evidence that the Contract 302 properties held substantial opportunity for
large fields of commercially exploitable oil and gas. The only reason that
Claimants cannot further prove this is because of Kazakhstan’s unlawful actions.
The Sapphire, AIG Capital, and SPP tribunals awarded their respective claimants
their out-of-pocket expenses, plus an amount to compensate the potential upside of
the opportunity. Here, Claimants invested USD 31,330,000 in exploring and
analyzing the Contract 302 property, excluding the investment in the Munaibay-1
well. The amount USD 1,498,017,000 represents the middle case of the potential
net income that would have been earned from those areas, absent Kazakhstan’s
actions. (CPHB 1 {553 — 555).

1648. Considering Respondent’s criticism of the valuation of the Interoil Reef resource
area, this area unsurprisingly holds the most potential of the Contract 302 resource

area, as well as higher risk. This area must, however, be considered valuable in a
damages award, given Respondent’s interest in gaining cost-free control over it by
any nefarious means possible. Claimants urge the Tribunal to value the property at
its full, unrisked, middle range, Best Estimate value. (C-III {| 64).

2. Arguments by Respondent

Claimants have suffered no damage with respect to any of the other discoveries or
prospects in the Contract 302 area. All have negative net present values, and
Deloitte’s findings remain unchallenged. GCA has, however, made a slight
revision to its calculation on the Munaibay East Oil discovery, and arrived at a net
present value of USD -223.7 million. (RPHB | {| 809 — 811). Anatolie Stati
provided dishonest testimony that inflated the results of the seismic survey of the
supposed Interoil Reef structure from 270 km2 to 380 km2. He was also dishonest
when he stated that Claimants had firmly decided to drill deeply throughout the
alleged reef structure. Even if it had been possible, Claimants were physically
unable to drill beyond a depth of 4700m, due to pressure in 2008. (RPHB | {{ 113
— 114).

Applying the oft-cited Chorzéw principle of damage compensation, Claimants’
case unravels. Under Chorzow, the only damage that could be compensated would
be reliance damages. There is no international law or doctrine pursuant to which
the breach of a promise to conclude a contract would result in damages. Even if
there had been no breach of the alleged promise to extend the contract, Claimants
still would not have had a claim to develop the Contract 302 area because the
contract would simply have terminated on 30 March 2009. Claimants have always
accepted that Respondent was not under an obligation to extend Contract 302.
Since Claimants complain of a “bad faith refusal” to extend the contract, under
international law, Claimants’ damages are limited to Claimants’ expenditure made
in reliance on MEMR’s alleged April 2009 promise to extend Contract 302. Since
Claimants have neither alleged nor demonstrated any damage based on reliance,
their damage claim for Contract 302 is zero. (R-II (48, 52 — 53; RPHB 2 521,
550 — 556).

Even if the Republic had extended the contract period to 30 March 2011, it is
unlikely that Claimants could have discovered the alleged Interoil Reef, even with
the alleged Munaibay-3 well. In the 2008 Due Diligence, it was TNG’s position
that the capital expenditure set out therein correctly reflected TNG’s future
intentions. Thus, they cannot now claim that they intended to do more than stated
in the program, especially since it was TNG’s usual practice to abide by their
programs. Ultra-deep drilling was not part of the exploration program that
Claimants submitted to the MEMR in April 2009. Importantly, this program was
submitted after the 3D seismic survey on the Munaibay area had been completed. It
was, therefore, clear that they did not see the Interoil Reef as a viable prospect at
the time. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 120 — 122).

Under Claimants’ new theory that, but for the alleged harassment campaign, TNG
would have penetrated the Interoil Reef with the Munaibay-1 well before 30 March
2009, Claimants could argue that they are entitled to more than reliance damage.
Factually, however, the 4700m deep Munaibay-1 well never could have reached

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 360 of 415
Page 359 of 414

the at least 6000m deep Interoil Reef and this is uncontested between the experts. (R-
TI {4 50, 105 — 201; RPHB 2 {{{[ 557 — 558, 638 — 646).

1653.Claimants attempt to create a claim for damages where none exists, casting their
claim as one for “Joss of opportunity” to develop the Contract 302 area. This claim
is based on the prospective value of USD 1.45 billion does not correspond with
Claimants’ case on liability regarding that area. Claimants did not add the claim of
loss of opportunity or out-of-pocket expenses until the Hearing on Quantum.
(RPHB 1 {{{[ 702 — 707; RPHB 2 {[521).

1654. International law does not recognize a principle of loss of opportunity. The cases
cited by Claimants, including Gemplus v. Mexico, SPP v. Egypt, Sapphire
International v. NOIC, AIG Capital Partners v. Kazakhstan, and SOABI v. Senegal
do not support Claimants’ claim. For example, Gemplus and SPP v. Egypt are
factually distinguishable because, unlike in the present case, they each involved
enterprises that had already proven themselves to be profitable. The tribunal in
Gemplus stated that, under international law, claimants bear the burden of proving
loss and “if that loss is found to be too uncertain or speculative or otherwise
unproven, the Tribunal must reject these claims, even if liability is established
against the Respondent.” The Sapphire tribunal would have rejected Claimants’
approach to its prospective damages, in that it awarded only 4.5% of the investor’s
total potential profit after taking all risks into account. This is in stark contrast to
Claimants’ claim for the unrisked prospective value of the Contract 302 property.
The Sapphire tribunal also rejected the idea that all risks should be resolved against
the Republic, as Claimants argue. Sapphire emphasized mutual reliance by
investor and state on the probability of future profits, Respondent had not
accumulated extensive documentation of the Contract 302 properties before it
granted the exploration license to Claimants. Prior to this arbitration, neither the
Republic nor KMG EP had valued the Contract 302 properties. In this regard, the
minimum investment requirement under the working programme does not qualify
as an indication of the Republic’s reliance on the probability of discovering and
commercially exploiting the Contract 302 properties, as each investor is required to
undertake them. The Sapphire tribunal also had ex aequo et bono powers, which
this Tribunal does not. In A/G, the Tribunal considered that “the opportunity to
make a commercial success” qualified as an investment under the US/Kazakh BIT,
without explanation. Lacking such explanation, it should not be used as a guide.
This SOABI case is also in applicable, as it concerns the actual loss of an existing
opportunity from an existing relationship, and not, as Claimants argue, with the
non-granting of an opportunity to which Claimants were not entitled. Claimants’
claim relates to what the SOABI tribunal would refer to as “hypothetical damage,
the occurrence of which is purely conjectural” and cannot be awarded as
compensation. (R-III {| 116 — 121; RPHB 2 {[ 559 — 598).

1655.Under the international legal principle of actori incumbit onus probandi, the
burden of proof lies with Claimants. They allege the entitlement to compensation
and it is their burden to establish the existence and extent of that compensation,
irrespective of whether the legal qualification of their claim is one for loss of
opportunity or for loss of profits. This burden of proof is often why tribunals
decline to award compensation for future profits in investment arbitration. (R-II {{]
102 — 103; see also R-I {{f 46.19 — 46.26).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 361 of 415
Page 360 of 414

1656.The investor must meet a high threshold to establish a claim for lost profits,
especially due to the degree of economic, political, and social exposure of long-
term investment projects. To meet this threshold, an investor must “show that their
project either has a track record of profitability rooted in a perennial history or
operations, or has binding contractual revenue obligations in place which
establish the expectation of profit at a certain level and over a given number of
years.” This is true even for projects in early stages. Claimants have neither
alleged nor proven either element. (R-II {{{ 129 — 135; R-I {{[ 46.19 er seq.).

1657. One of the best-settled rules of the law of state responsibility, as confirmed in cases
such as Levitt v. Iran and Autopista Concesionada v. Venezuela, is to deny
reparation for speculative damages. Respondent rejects Claimants’ speculative
fall-back position on loss of profits. The testimony of Dr. Kim of KNOC
established that exploration blocks cannot be valued due to their speculative
character. (R-II {ff 122 — 128; R-I{ 46.19 et seq.).

1658.Claimants’ “benefit of the doubt” argument turns the facts on their head, and
ignores the maximum 5% GCOS for the Interoil Reef and that, during the 11-year
life of Contract 302, Claimants did not undertake to explore the Interoil Reef.
Even if the Republic had extended Contract 302, Claimants had no plan to explore
(and, hence, no reason to make a discovery in) the Interoil Reef Thus, even if the
contract had expired in March 2011, no work would have been undertaken there.
(R-I {{[ 52 et seq.; R-II {f 48, 54 — 138; RPHB 2 521).

1659.Claimants are responsible for a substantial part of the uncertainty regarding the
Interoil Reef. They also failed to take any action during the life of the contract to
explore the reef. The 2D seismic was shot in 2000 and 2001. TNG did not even
start drilling the Munaibay-1 well until February 2008. They would have needed
2.5 years to drill the exploration well. They introduced the information so late in
the proceedings that a thorough analysis, which could have led to clearer results,
was impossible. It was not until the Hearing on Quantum that Claimants suddenly
remembered that they had conducted a 3D seismic study on Munaibay and that,
accordingly, they (1) were ready to build an exploration well, (2) had acquired the
deep drilling rig just for that purpose, and (3) were prepared to move everything to
Kazakhstan in fall 2008. Even if these allegations were true, however, Claimants
could never have declared a commercial discovery of the alleged Reef within the
extended period to 30 March 2011. Claimants cannot disregard the working
program that they submitted on 14 October 2008 which contained slower drilling
times, nor should Claimants’ inexperience in ultra-deep drilling be ignored.
Claimants chose to drill before having acquired the 3D seismic. As was made clear
at the final hearing, the Munaibay-1 well would not have reached the Interoil Reef.
According to Mr. Nowicki, that well would have needed to be more than 6750m
deep, whereas its target depth was only 6000m. Thus, it was never possible that
Claimants could have penetrated the Interoil Reef with the Munaibay—1 well prior
to the end of the contract term. They chose an inadequate drill that broke down at
4700m in the face of high, but predictable, pressure. Then, they commissioned a
3D seismic survey which did not even cover the complete reef. There is no
evidence of the existence of the alleged Georgian replacement drill, the existence
of which Respondent denies. There are holes in the story, such as the gap between
why Claimants would wait until early 2009 to drill, why the alleged reef was not
contained in the draft addendum to Contract 302 submitted at the end of April

2009, why the working program did not foresee further drilling of Munaibay-1
well, or why other Munaibay-2 drilling was only scheduled for 4700m. The
speculations about the time necessary to drill such a well also ignore the challenges
of drilling in an H2S rich environment, the necessary administrative procedures for
such drilling, and their own inexperience. Claimants’ contentions regarding
interference with the exploration of Contract 302 properties are contradictory. In
order to reach the Interoil Reef depth by the end of the contract term, Claimants
would have needed to remove the old rig from the well, move the new rig to the
well, assemble the new rig, and drill to the required depth — all in a period of three
months. Without being able to prove that the alleged discovery was commercially
exploitable, Claimants would not have been able to assert rights to it pursuant to
Section 8 of Contract 302. Thus, they have only themselves to blame and cannot
be granted the benefit of the doubt. (RPHB | {{[ 708 — 735; RPHB 2 {ff 117 — 119,
123, 638 — 646).

At the Hearing on Quantum, even Ascom’s geologists demonstrated their disbelief
that the Munaibay-1 well would have reached the Interoil Reef, even if drilled to
6000m. They believed that the top of the reef could start at 6500m and that the
Munaibay-1 well would penetrate the structure between 6600m and 6700m.
Ascom’s geologists informed Claimants’ counsel about this prior to the Hearing on
Quantum, but they and Claimants’ witnesses deliberately concealed the position of
Ascom’s geologists, thereby misleading the Tribunal and Respondent. But, GCA
concurs with Ascom’s geologists that the well would not have reached the
structure, even if Claimants had overcome their technical challenges to resurrect
the Munaibay-1 well that they were forced to abandon at 4700m. It is clear,
however, that Claimants used inadequate equipment and got stuck 1300m prior to
reaching what in all likelihood would have been a dry hole. (RPHB | {799 —
808).

Mr. Cojin’s testimony was often incorrect. He testified that Contract 302 expired
in 2018, when everyone knew it expired in 2009. He described how TNG Drilled
the Munaibay-2 well, but in truth, that well was never drilled. (RPHB 2 {{] 24 —
25)

Claimants’ claim for out-of-pocket expenses has no legal basis in either Contract
302 or in international law. Since Claimants never declared a discovery, they were
not entitled to reimbursement for exploration expenses under Section 8.9 of
Contract 302 and they knew that they were not entitled to reimbursement prior to
April. Additionally, contrary to Claimants’ assertion, the Gemplus tribunal did not
award any out-of-pocket expenses. While the Sapphire tribunal awarded out-of-
pocket expenses, it provided no explanation for having done so, beyond that the
expenses were incurred in performing the contract. Here, as indicated, no
discovery was declared during the life of the contract, rendering Sapphire
inapplicable. The SPP v. Egypt tribunal awarded out-of-pocket expenses since
those could not be recouped with future profits, due to the breach. Here, however,
even if the alleged breach had not occurred, Claimants would not have been able to
recoup their out-of-pocket expenses. The AIG v. Kazakhstan tribunal, while
awarding out-of-pocket expenses, failed to provide reasoning for that decision.
(RPHB 2 {{{[ 599 — 612).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 363 of 415
Page 362 of 414

1663.Claimants used Mr. Nowicki of Ryder Scott to introduce new evidence of 3D
seismic data on the “Jnteroil Reef.” His statements were misleading because they
insinuate that the 3D seismic data revealed slight modifications. Placing the 2D
and 3D maps atop of one another, one sees that the 2D seismic data is at a different
location than the 3D. It is apparent that the 3D data reveals an entirely new and
different structure and was not a mere update. It also demonstrates that the old 2D
data was of extremely poor quality, making any reliance on it suspect. The 3D data
disproves the 2D based “Reef” interpretation in favor of the new 3D interpretation,
, making the actual GCOS 0%. The 3D supersedes the 2D and replaces the earlier
interpretation. Mr. Nowicki did not have sufficient time to do such an assessment,
let alone to evaluate the 3D seismic data prior to testifying — he received the data
less than one week before the Hearing. An assessment of 3D data requires months.
Mr. Nowicki used the 3D data, presented in the “Project Munaibay 3D
Presentation,” which was prepared by Claimants, to arbitrarily increase the GCOS
From 5% to 9%. It is clear that he simply presented the Claimants’ assessment as
his own, and this fundamentally undermines his credibility. In the new structure
based on the 3D data, it is noted that the structure extends beyond the boundaries of
the Contract 302 area and into the block of another subsoil user. This has
substantial consequences for unitization, volumes, costs, and governmental
approvals. Claimants’ cost and development schedules need to be disregarded
entirely. (RPHB 1 [521 — 529, 548; RPHB 2 {J 535 — 536, 544 — 548).

1664.Ryder Scott’s interpretation of the “/nteroil Reef’ does not demonstrate closure,
which is crucial to the assumption that there is a valid trap containing
hydrocarbons. Without it, hydrocarbons could have migrated. Ryder Scott’s
reliance on a single 2D seismic line to suggest that there might be some indication
of closure in the southwest of the structure is not credible. Ryder Scott testified
that it never relied on the 2D line; GCA noted that the 2D line was poor and said
nothing about the geological conditions of the surroundings. Mr. Nowicki’s
statement at the Hearing that “in my mind, I know that there has to be more to that
reef. It doesn’t just end where the data ends” is a demonstration of Ryder Scott’s
wishful thinking. Ryder Scott also attempted to avoid discussing faulting in the
“Interoil Reef’, which could make a trap invalid and enable hydrocarbons to
migrate. GCA and Total E&P addressed the clearly visible and devastating
faulting at the Interoil Reef interval. GCA has interpreted the data and found that
the data does not show potential for further potential for hydrocarbons through a
“stratigraphic trap”. To the North and Southwest, the 3D seismic data is
inconclusive. Total E&P reviewed the same 3D seismic data in 2009 and
concluded that the roof does not close, meaning that there could not be a trap.
(RPHB | {| 736 — 749; RPHB 2 {| 523 — 525, 532 — 533).

1665. Assuming for the sake of argument that there is a deep full scale closure and a large
trap, Deloitte arrives at a negative net present value of USD — 89.4 million. This
non-commerciality is the result of a comparatively high development costs and the
length of development. The ECOS would remain unchanged for the model, but
there is a change in the GCOS. The best ultimate recovery would amount to 58.5
Bem’, at a GCOS of 5%, due to the low probability of full closure and the likely
lack of seal effectiveness. A full closure and a tight seal within the geological
structure are important, because otherwise the oil could leak out, leaving a dry
hole. There are several reasons to doubt the seal on the Interoil Reef, as there are
several faults cut through the structure. This can destroy a seal and create

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 364 of 415
Page 363 of 414

pathways along which hydrocarbons can migrate out of a trap, as they have in other
parts of the alleged structure. Total E&P made the same observation when
considering the property, and they observed seven faults above the reef structure.
Where there is low seal effectiveness, Deloitte puts the unrisked net present value
at USD -456 million. (RPHB | {{[ 780 — 798 R-II {{{[ 86, 93 — 98 (net present value
of -83.7 million)).

1666. In addition, the likely presence of H2S — which is confirmed by the Reef’s location,
Total E&P’s analysis, and publications by Ryder Scott — greatly increases the
necessary planning, drilling costs, drilling durations, and equipment costs and
expenditures of the Interoil Reef. H2S is corrosive and toxic to humans and is
associated with extended drill times. Mr. Romanosov’s suggestion that treatment
facilities for the Tolkyn field gas would be sufficient to handle the Interoil Reef is
“laughable.”(RPHB 1 {756 — 769).

1667.GCA evaluated the two “Jnteroil Reef’ cases with different GCOS-es. GCA
evaluated the “/nteroil Reef’ on the basis that 10% of the supposed gas stream will
consist of H2S. Respondent’s reliance on the Tengiz and Kashagan fields as
analogs is appropriate because the Tengiz reservoirs and the “Interoil Reef” are
roughly the same age. The Tolkyn field is millions of years younger. H2S is not a
result of source rock contamination (necessary for Claimants’ misinformed
“distance” argument), but instead occurs at specific temperatures and pressures.
Geographic vicinity plays only a marginal role — and in any event, the difference is
only 11 km. (Tengiz is located 45 km away from the Interoil Reef, Tolkyn 34 km).
Ryder Scott has admitted that there is a 50% chance of at least 1% H2S in the
“Interoil Reef’ gas and admits that that amount would require special treatment
facilities. (RPHB 2 {{[ 614 — 621).

1668.Claimants argue that, if Tengiz and Kashagan are picked as analogs, then it is
necessary to assume higher condensate yield. There is, however, no relationship
between the presence of contaminates and the level of condensate yield.
Condensate is created through a geological process, whereas contaminate levels
depend on the reservoir itself. The thermochemical sulphate reduction is a
chemical reaction that depends on reservoir temperature and not on source rock
temperature. GCA has estimated that the depth of the reservoir and the geothermal
gradient of that area indicates that a temperature of 160 — 180 C can be expected.
This is the range at which thermochemical sulphate reduction occurs. Higher
depths tend to mean less oil and condensate and more gas in a reservoir. In other
evaluations, Ryder Scott has concluded that a contaminate level of 25% had to be
expected in a gas stream from Type II prospects, like Tengiz and Kashagan.
(RPHB 2 {{{[ 622 — 631).

1669.The 3D seismic proves that the alleged Reef is non-commercial — the prospect is
comparative small and has a high development cost and requires a long time for its
development, due to the presence of significant quantities of H2S in the gas stream.
In the best case scenario under GCA’s interpretation, the ultimate recovery of gas
amounts to 3.7 Bem’ and reaches a depth of 6150m. Compared to the Tolkyn
field’s peak performance of 2.37 Bem’, it is clear that the alleged reef does not
provide for huge reserves of gas. (RPHB 1 {{[ 736 — 749). Ryder Scott’s
assumption about gas volumes, based on an unrealistic gas column of 2000m, is
unrealistic. The largest gas column known to GCA is 1450m. It is apparent that

Ryder Scott’s high case has never been observed and their low case has only been
observed on 5% of all fields. Ryder Scott’s maps also do not support the gas
column estimates. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 526 — 531).

Claimants have ignored that the standard of sufficient probability would be
applicable to a claim for lost opportunity. Applied here, Claimants would need to
demonstrate a “very strong chance” that deposits of commercially workable oil
exist in the concession area. Regarding the GCOS and ECOS, GCA estimates the
GCOS of 10% of the Interoil Reef. This means that, in 90% of all cases, an
operator will not find the structure as outlined. They estimate an ECOS of 50%,
which is unchanged from the review of the 2D seismic data. These risks need to be
accounted for, but even disregarding these, however, as Deloitte have calculated,
the Interoil Reef has an unrisked net present value of USD — 249.3 million. (R-I {|
52; R-II {if 84 — 98; 113 — 115 (discussing 5% ECOS); RPHB | {| 777 — 779).

FTI’s drilling CAPEX estimates are so illogical that they have been empirically
disproven by FTI. While FTI assumed responsibility for these flaws, they are not
qualified to provide such estimates. At the Hearing, Mr. Rosen of FTI agreed that
the deeper an operator drills, the higher the costs per meter will be. Claimants
thereafter amended their well cost estimates to account for all instances of
increasing costs per meter drilled, rather than decreasing costs per meter as
previously stated and which Mr. Rosen had defended. The amendment shows that
Claimants have admitted their mistake. Claimants’ claim that an exploratory well
to a depth of 4700m would cost USD 10 million is belied by FTI’s own evidence,
which calculated that the Munaibay-1 exploration well, which ultimately reached
that same depth, cost USD 18 million. Regarding the non-drilling cost estimate
and as confirmed at the hearing, FTI failed to provide any explanation for the
infrastructure that they considered necessary for the development of the Contract
302 area. Mr. Rosen had no basic understanding of what was necessary to assess
the costs of infrastructure. Instead, FTI simply adopted Claimants’ assumptions in
the cost estimates. At the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Rosen of FTI conceded that
FTI had applied incorrectly low administration costs for the Contract 302 area
because FTI assumed that the Tolkyn and Contract 302 Area could operate jointly.
In addition, FTI’s valuation on gas pricing was based on the unsigned undated
2008 Agreement. FTI then applied this price to the Contract. 302 properties, even
though §§ 2.3 and 3.1 of the Tripartite Agreement clearly state that it concerns only
gas from Tolkyn. The new development schedule based on the 3D data can be
criticized for the same reasons. (RPHB 1 {| 554 — 565, 581 — 587, 591 — 592;
RPHB 2 {| 499 534; 537 - 543).

FTI’s update of their Contract 302 prospective valuation in the Third Report
included an arbitrary rounding of the discount rate which inflated the valuation by
USD 44 million. FTI understated the variable distribution costs by USD 9 million.
And, by not incorporating an assumption for net working capital into the Contract
302 properties valuation, FTI inflated the valuation by USD 55 million.
Accounting for the GCOS and ECOS as well, the value assumed by FTI would
need to be reduced to USD 136. (RPHB 2 {{f[ 459 — 460).

FTI’s costs for gas flowlines were understated by a factor of 20. They overlooked
the need to construct an in-field facility to separate their gas and condensate from
the Interoil Reef. They assumed that old, insufficient pipelines could be used and

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 366 of 415
Page 365 of 414

thereby neglected to create data for a new pipeline. Costs for treatment facilities
were also ignored, and it would be impossible for the resources from the Interoil
Reef to be treated at the existing facility at Borankol. They also failed to provide
facilities for the removal of H2S, and this would increase the cost by USD 200
million (assuming 1% H2S) or by USD 260 million (assuming 10% H2S). Finally
it is unclear what is meant by FTI’s term “Changing the extraction system.”
(RPHB 2 {{{ 542 — 543). FTI made no allowance for costs for the necessary
facilities in their evaluation and this increases the damages claim. GCA estimates
an infrastructure CAPEX of USD 459 to interpret the Interoil Reef. The alternative
5900m Reef that is not supported by 3D data requires a CAPEX of USD 2.35
billion. (RPHB 1 {770 — 773).

1674.Turning to witness credibility, Respondent argues that “Claimants’ costs and
development schedule are untenable as a matter of substance, they are also
non-credible since they are opaque, illogical and were apparently largely
prepared by Claimants themselves rather than by Claimants’ experts who lack
the necessary expertise in these matters.” (RPHB 1 { 547). In testimony,
Ryder Scott was completely unaware of the regulatory requirements that were
connected to the drilling schedules that formed the basis of the Ryder Scott
valuation was outside of their expertise. Ryder Scott solved their knowledge
problem by simply relying on Claimants’ estimates and intentions, and then
presenting them as Ryder Scott’s own expert findings. In effect, Claimants
have become their own experts. At the Hearing in May 2013, Claimants
attempted to respond to Respondent’s allegation. Ryder Scott does not claim
authorship of Claimants’ statement that “25 wells are scheduled” or that “a
two-rig schedule was implemented.” This can only mean that they were
provided by Claimants. No response was given for FTI having hidden that it
had taken over infrastructure cost estimates from Claimants. By contrast, GCA
has the necessary experience to prepare reliable development schedules and
cost estimates. (RPHB | {{{[ 546 — 552; RPHB 2 {If 466 — 469).

1675.At the Final Hearing, Claimants argued that the fact that well costs were
provided by Claimants was apparent from a footnote in the First FTI Report.
The footnote referenced, “We have discussed with Ryder Scott what a
reasonable estimate for capital costs for wells drilled in the different
depths/structures would be based on a review of Company's historical capital
expenditure costs for wells with adjustments made for varying depths,”
however, gives no such indication. It leads the reader to believe that a
historical analysis was conducted. FTI did not even purport to do any analysis
on whether the well costs provided by Claimants were reasonable. Their
analysis has no credibility. (RPHB 2 {{[ 470 — 474).

1676.In response to Claimants’ contention that GCA should have provided several
different scenarios involving costs related to H2S, GCA explained that the mid-
case assessment was sufficient. (RPHB 2 { 634).

1677.FTI’s calculations that are based on higher condensate yield are misleading.
First, a production start in 2012 is not possible since additional research,
including new 3D seismic, would need to be completed. The present research
is very poor and do not enable the flanks of the Interoil Reef to be mapped with
confidence. Even Ryder Scott agreed that the 3D survey was not sufficient to

define the structure. Additional seismic surveying would only add one year.
GCA explains that assuming a production start prior to 2018 is improper. The
prices that would be realizable in 2019 are not the same as would be realizable
in 2012 — that ignores seven years of inflation. FTI also ignores increases in
the costs of production, taxes, and ECOS and GCOS. Deloitte performed a
proper analysis using FTI’s assumed condensate yield and still come up with a
negative value of the Interoil Reef. (RPHB 2 {[ 632 — 637).

GCA provided an outline FDP setting out the steps for the development of the
Interoil Reef. According to this, and based on challenges outlined, production
would begin in 2018. Claimants’ experts, on the other hand, unrealistically assume
that the first two production wells on the Interoil Reef would be drilled in 2009 and
that production would start in 2010. This is even inconsistent with Claimants’
production history. The wells in Tolkyn, for example, were drilled in 2001 but
only started producing non-negligible volumes of gas in 2004. The assumption
that they would have more success with a deeper well is nonsensical. (RPHB | {fl
714-716).

Claimants’ Munaibay Oil claim is overstated by 63.8% (USD 37.7 million). While
Claimants accuse GCA of manipulating its resource and capital expenditures
estimates, this is incorrect and GCA has explained the reasons for changes to the
estimates. Changes were based on a later analysis of the result of the drilling on
age-equivalent reservoirs in Tolkyn field. As a result, there were even upward
corrections on some wells. GCA provided Chrystal ball sheets, as well as cost
estimates, showing the changes. The minor error in the phasing of capital
expenditure on Munaibay was admitted by GCA and was corrected in GCA’s Third
Report. The value of the Munaibay discover remains negative, despite the change.
(RPHB 2 {{f[ 549, 647 — 651).

The RBS valuation report conducted as part of the KMG EP Due Diligence in
September 2009 contains no value for any of the Contract 302 properties and
provides no support for their alleged USD 1.5 billion loss of opportunity. (RPHB 1
{il 986 — 989). In FTI’s Additional Expert Report of 25 January 2013, Claimants
grant the Tribunal the discretion to decide which part of the highly exaggerated
prospective value of USD 1.448 billion to award as opportunity damage for the
Contract 302 properties. (RPHB | {| 986).

Respondent also explained that FTI improperly disregarded risk by virtue of its
inappropriate “prospective” valuation method. Such a “prospective” value bears
no relationship to what real investors in an open market would pay for an asset and
should, therefore, play no role for valuation purposes. The Uniform Standards of
Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) only uses the term “prospective value”
when in reference to real property and personal property. There is no reason to
apply it to an oil and gas development. Furthermore, as Deloitte have shown, the
use of a prospective value does not support the complete disregard of risk, as
suggested by FTI. (RPHB 1 {566 — 569).

Other methodological flaws in FTI’s analysis include that they incorrectly mixed
the nominal and the real valuation approaches. As a result, they applied inflation
twice, causing revenues to increase disproportionately and cash-flows to be
overstated. When they conceded this error, it reduced the overall value estimate by

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 368 of 415
Page 367 of 414

USD 379 million. When correcting this mistake, they applied a different inflation
rate to their assumption — 1.61%, rather than 2.82%, which leads to lower nominal
cost projections. While they based this change on an assumption that the new rate
was “more appropriate”, in reality, the change was untenable. The sole reason for
the change was to limit the impact of the correction that was necessary. In
addition, FTI’s arbitrary rounding of their discount rate from 14.41% to 14% adds
USD 49.3 million to Claimants’ claim. (RPHB {570 — 577).

1683.One risk associated with investment projects in the early stage is the
creditworthiness of the purchaser. Since Claimants have not named any purchaser
who would take their gas from the Contract 302 properties, they have not, a
fortiori, d for the risks iated with such a purch . Further, if the
claimant cannot establish that there was a reasonable certainly of lost profits, it
cannot determine with reasonable confidence what those lost profits would be. As
a result, their claim must be dismissed. (R-II {136 — 138).

 

 

3. The Tribunal

1684. The timelines of events provided above in this Award show that TNG informed
MEMR on 10 October 2008 that it no longer wished to enter into the appraisal
phase but instead wanted a two-year extension on the exploration contract. The 14
October 2008 extension request and proposed work program indicated this intent
and showed a planned drilling depth of 6000m and a second ultra-deep well on the
subsalt horizon. From the evidence supplied, the Tribunal is satisfied that when
TNG stopped drilling at 4700m because it encountered pressures that required a
heavier rig, Claimants acquired a rig with a depth capacity of 7000m in Georgia
and it was ready for transport in January 2009.

1685.Only after Respondent started its breaching and harassing conduct did Claimants
decline to move the rig to Kazakhstan, opting instead to resolve disputes with the
MEMR before prudently continuing investment in the Contract 302 area. Taking
into account the Tribunal’s considerations above in this Award regarding
causation, the Tribunal accepts that Claimants could have reasonably expected the
extension of the Contract under the usual professional relationship with the
Respondent’s institutions as it existed before 14 October 2008. Kazakhstan’s
refusal to formally extend Contract 302 prevented further exploration work on the
area must be considered as part of, and caused by, the treatment which the Tribunal
has found above to be in breach of the ECT.

1686. Regarding the damages caused, the Tribunal sees no difficulty in accepting that the
Claimants’ investment of out of pocket expenses of USD 31,330,000 in exploring
and analyzing the Contract 302 property, excluding the investment in the
Munaibay-1 well, are indeed such damages due.

1687.As both Claimants and Respondent submit, the further damages claimed for lost
profit or lost opportunity provide a much higher threshold for Claimants’ burden of
proof. This threshold is high both legally and factually. The Parties rely in some
detail on the various earlier decisions of other tribunals dealing with this issue and
take very different views on their interpretation and applicability for the case at
hand.

Page 368 of 414

This Tribunal does not need to go into these legal issues because it considers that,
in any event, Claimants have not been able to provide sufficient factual proof for
the lost profits they claim. In this context, Respondent (R-III {| 129 et seq.) has
rightly referred to the comments in Prof. Crawford’s Commentaries on the ILC
Articles on State Responsibility and to respective comments in earlier awards that
the investor must meet a high standard of proof to establish a claim for lost profits,
especially due to the degree of economic, political, and social exposure of long-
term investment projects. To meet this standard, an investor must show that their
project either has a track record of profitability rooted in a perennial history of
operations, or has binding contractual revenue obligations in place that establish
the expectation of profit at a certain level over a given number of years. This is true
even for projects in early stages.

In the view of this Tribunal, Claimants have not proven either element. The
Tribunal does not agree with Claimants that, in this regard, the benefit of the doubt
belongs to Claimants as the victims and not to Respondent as the wrong-doer.
Rather, the burden of proof remains with Claimants. While it is true that no
absolute certainty of proof can be required for such losses in the future, a high
threshold of sufficient probability must be applied to a claim for lost opportunity.

During the 11-year life of Contract 302, Claimants did not undertake to explore the
Interoil Reef. The 2D seismic was shot in 2000 and 2001. TNG did not start
drilling the Munaibay-1 well until February 2008. Claimants would have needed
2.5 years to drill the exploration well. Claimants have not proven that they could
have declared a commercial discovery of the Interoil Reef within the extended
period to 30 March 2011. The working program that Claimants submitted on 14
October 2008 contained slower drilling times. Claimants had no experience drilling
ultra-deep wells. Claimants chose to drill before having acquired the 3D seismic
and drilled a well that, admittedly, would not have been sufficient to reach the
6000m deep Interoil Reef. Ultra-deep drilling was not part of the exploration
program that Claimants submitted to the MEMR in April 2009. They first chose an
inadequate drill that broke down at 4700m in the face of high, but probably
predictable, pressure and only then acquired the Georgian drill. As pointed out in
some detail by Respondent (RPHB | {| 799 ef seg.) and at the Hearing on
Quantum, even Claimants’ geologists were not sure that the Munaibay-1 well
would have reached the Interoil Reef, even if drilled to 6000m.

Assuming that Respondent had extended Contract 302, and that Contract 302
would have expired in March 2011, Claimants have not provided sufficient

evidence that they would have realized the alleged lost profit or opportunity.

Therefore, this Tribunal concludes that Claimants have not fulfilled their burden of
proof in this regard.

L.VI. Quantum Related to LPG Plant
1. Arguments by Claimants
Shortly after President Nazarbayev issued the investigation order, construction on

the LPG Plant slowed. Mr. Broscaru’s unrebutted testimony is that this was
because non-Kazakh workers were unable to renew their work permits.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 370 of 415
Page 369 of 414

Construction was paused indefinitely in 2009 because (1) TNG’s liquidity position
was deteriorating, due in no small part to Kazakhstan causing Claimants to lose the
Credit Suisse loan facility and causing Vitol — another investor — to draw down its
revolving line of credit, and (2) it became too risky to invest additional capital on
construction of the LPG Plant. These delays increased the ultimate cost of
completing the LPG Plant by approximately USD 50 million (per GCA). But for
Kazakhstan’s actions, however, these delays would not have occurred and the LPG
Plant would have gone online in June 2009. Kazakhstan’s actions changed the
investment environment such that it was too risky to invest additional capital in an
asset that Kazakhstan could seize. As President Nazarbayev acknowledged on 19
November 2009, construction on the LPG Plant had halted as a result of
inspections by law enforcement. This was also acknowledged in the MEMR report
on its January 2010 inspections. When the Akim of the Mangystau Region offered
a proposal for TNG to borrow funds from State agencies to complete the facilities,
Anatolie Stati explained that the delays in the LPG Plant resulted from the State’s
actions, which precluded Claimants from raising or investing additional funds. The
Akim then reported to the Prime Minister Massimov that the construction had
stopped due to the financial and legal problems of the company and urged the
Prime Minister to dismiss the legal actions so that construction might resume.
(CPHB | {{{[ 358 — 364; CPHB 2 {f[ 215 - 222).

1694. Claimants seek to recover their investment costs of USD 245 million and the lost
opportunity since, but for Kazakhstan’s actions, Claimants would have developed
the LPG Plant and would have even been able to develop the evidence needed to
establish the FMV of the plant. As the tribunals in Sapphire and Gemplus also
agreed, the Respondent should not benefit from the evidentiary uncertainty that
results from its own misconduct. (CPHB | {| 558 — 559). Claimants request that
the Tribunal award damages for the LPG Plant that are equal to Claimants’
investment in the plant, plus some of the prospective value that Claimants could
have realized from processing the Contract 302 gas in the LPG Plant (CPHB | {

 

 

 

580):
Investment Cost US $245,000,000

Prospective Value US $329,077,000

Prospective Value Above Cost US $84,077,000

 

 

 

 

1695. Respondent’s market value of the LPG Plant of - USD 89.9 million is incorrect. It
completely and baselessly di ds the possibility of p ing third party gas at
the LPG Plant —an assumption not even adopted by KMG EP. The FMV is not an
appropriate measure of an asset that Claimants were prevented from turning into a
commercial success. Instead, the investment value, as held by the tribunals in
Metalclad v. Mexico, Vivendi v. Argentina, and Wena Hotels v. Egypt, is the
appropriate measure of damages for an asset that was not yet a going concern at the
time of the taking. Those tribunals recognize that when a state’s actions deprive an
investor of the opportunity to earn a profit, the investor is entitled to receive a
portion of that potential profit as compensation for that lost opportunity. (CPHB 2
{Ml 386 — 389).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 371 of 415
Page 370 of 414

1696.FTI’s prospective DCF valuation of USD 408.3 million for the LPG Plant is a
reasonable estimate of the value of the LPG Plant to Kazakhstan. The Tribunal
should not take seriously any argument that salvage value is an appropriate award
for a seized LPG Plant that Kazakhstan is on the verge of putting into operation at
full capacity:

66. As a preliminary matter, Deloitte’s assumption of salvage value is
intrinsically an inappropriate premise. As of the appropriate October 14,
2008 valuation date, Claimants fully intended to finish construction of the
LPG plant and put it into operation, and in connection with all of
Claimants’ efforts to sell the LPG Plant both before and after October 14,
2008, Claimants offered the Plant, and prospective purchasers bid on the
Plant, not as scrap but as prospectively operational. This fact is clearly
reflected in the indicative offers made by interested buyers in 2008, which
valued the LPG Plant at US $150 million on average. Indeed, the offer
made for the LPG Plant by KazMunaiGas at that time was US $199
million. While Claimants did not accept these offers because at the time
they deemed them too low and did not feel that they would lead to a sale,
the Tribunal should note that State-owned KazMunaiGas itself offered
almost US $200 million for the Plant, more than six times the highest value
assigned to the LPG Plant by Deloitte of US $32 million. Little more is
needed to demonstrate that Deloitte’s salvage value assumptions and
calculations are worthless.

67. Furthermore, current publicly available information indicates that
Kazakhstan is in fact gearing up to finally open the LPG Plant in 2012. In
a document entitled “List of Investment projects of the Mangistauskoi
Region, which are being supervised in 2011,” there is a specific reference
to the LPG Plant under “Regional Projects”. The project is identified as
having a cost of US $315 million (47 billion Tenge), and it is expected to
start up in the first half of 2012 with a capacity of 7 mem of gas per day. It
is clear that, with an identified cost of US $315 million, Kazakhstan has
been in the process of spending additional capital to complete the LPG
Plant since its seizure, and that consequently Kazakhstan does not view the
Plant as scrap. Furthermore, Kazakhstan is training specialists for
operation of the LPG Plant, a clear indication that Kazakhstan is going to
complete the Plant and put it into operation. [...] (C-III 1 66 — 69).

1697.FTI made its prospective DCF valuation under the conservative and reasonable
assumption that only gas supplies from Tolkyn, Borankol, and the Contract 302
properties would be processed in the LPG Plant. When Claimants commenced the
LPG Plant project, they believed that the Tolkyn field alone would produce
sufficient gas for the LPG Plant to produce 7 mcm per day for several years. There
were also plans to produce gas from the Contract 302 properties as production from
Tolkyn declined. While the LPG Plant had the capability to process gas from third
party sources, TNG always expected to use the LPG Plant to process its own gas
supplies. (C-III {{[ 70 — 71).

1698.Respondent’s objection to the FTI’s prospective DCF valuation, namely that there
would not be enough gas from Claimants’ properties or from third parties to make
it profitable, is inconsistent with Respondent’s current plans for the LPG Plant.
The viability of the LPG Plant does not hinge on the availability of gas from the

Tolkyn field or the Contract 302 properties. FTI did, however, create an unrisked
NPV of the plant that assumed full production from Contract 302, due to
uncertainty regarding the terms of third-party gas sources. With these adjustments,
the prospective value from the LPG Plant is USD 408.3 million. (C-III {73 - 75,
77; CPHB 1 568).

At minimum, Claimants’ recoverable investment value for the LPG Plant is USD
245 million. This amount includes the USD 37 million expenditures through May
2009 that Claimants would not have incurred had Claimants been able to sell the
LPG Plant in October 2008. (C-III fn. 179).

FTI based its assessment of the investment value of the LPG Plant on the book
value of the LPG Plant as of 14 October 2008 as contained in TNG’s Third Quarter
financial statements, which were not prepared for litigation and were reviewed by
KPMG. The Tristan Oil Annual Report for 2009 was used to reflect investments
after 14 October 2008. By contrast, Mr. Wood effectively admitted that his cost
estimates are simply a “black box’, based on his experience. (CPHB 2 354 —
355).

In early submissions, FTI applied the “book value” for the LPG Plant as a proxy for
FMV, because “the value of the LPG Plant, assuming only the use of the Borankol
and Tolkyn field volumes, is less than the book value of the assets which is the total
incurred capital expenditures of the LPG as at the Valuation Date.” This value,
USD 208.5 million, was very conservative and did not provide a value for
Claimants’ lost opportunity from to earn profits from the LPG Plant upon
completion. (C-I {419 — 420).

Kazakhstan asserts that damages should be reduced by the debts owed by KPM and
TNG to Vitol under the COMSA prepayment terms and the LPG financing
arrangements. Respondent’s arguments that Claimants’ damages must be reduced
because Vitol was a fifty-fifty joint partner in the LPG Plant, and because of the
debt owed by Montvale to Vitol under the COMSA prepayment arrangement, are
legally and factually incorrect. First, Vitol never owned an equitable interest in the
LPG Plant but rather promised to provide (but never provided) half of the financing
for the construction of the LPG Plant in exchange for the right to market the off-
take of the Plant and to receive a portion of the LPG Plant’s profits. The Joint
Operating Agreement with Vitol for the LPG Plant project addressed the rights of
the parties upon termination, including for the event that Kazakhstan asserted rights
to the LPG Plant. In that agreement, contrary to Kazakhstan’s contention, the
parties contemplated that all of Vitol’s rights would transfer to Ascom upon
termination and that Ascom would seek compensation from the Government in the
event that the Government asserted ownership rights over the plant. This is an
illustration of the necessity of the Chorzéw and Occidental v. Ecuador principle
not to reduce the damages by the amounts owed to third Parties. Vitol never had
any ownership interest in that Plant and was never an “Investor” for purposes of the
ECT. To the extent that Claimants owe contractual obligations to Vitol under the
Joint Operating Agreement, that issue is not before this Tribunal. Accordingly, the
Tribunal should not consider any such obligations, which are disputed, in
calculating the amount of compensation due to Claimants for the assets that
Kazakhstan wrongfully seized. (CPHB | {| 641 — 645).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 373 of 415
Page 372 of 414

1703. Under the intended financial structure for the LPG Plant, Claimants and Vitol had
originally planned to finance the LPG Plant with a combination of USD 20 million
equity contribution from Vitol and Ascom, each financing from
KazCommerzBank. This intended financial structure, which in any event is
irrelevant for purposes of quantum, never came to pass. Instead, Claimants retired
all KazCommerzBank debt in 2007 and Vitol drew down its debt financing to USD
46 million in addition to the USD 20 million contribution. As a result, TNG
financed all of the construction of the LPG Plant, apart from the USD 66 million
provided by Vitol. The LPG Plant was not a “black hole” with ever increasing
costs — the cost increases corresponded with observed increases in inflation and
LPG product prices. (CPHB 1| {| 573 — 576).

1704. At the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Rosen (FTI) explained how the investment cost
basis is an appropriate standard of valuation for the LPG Plant. FTI assumes that
the LPG is a “going concern” since it would have been completed and would have
operated, absent Respondent’s interference. While one would typically consider
the cashflow basis to evaluate the value of a going concern, that information was
lacking. Accordingly, Mr. Rosen looked to the cost basis or investment basis to
determine the LPG Plant’s value. (CPHB 1 | 560 — 561).

1705.Kazakhstan’s cost assumption of USD 100 million is a massive, USD 50 million
overstatement of the costs required to complete the LPG Plant, as confirmed in
GCA’s testimony at the Hearing on Quantum. But for Respondent’s actions,
construction would not have stopped and it would have only cost USD 50 million
to complete. (CPHB | {{ 562).

1706. Kazakhstan assumes — contrary to the evidence — that the LPG Plant would have
gone online first in mid-2011. Accordingly, it fails to account for two full years of
production that would have been achieved, but for Kazakhstan’s violations.
Evidence regarding third party gas was also ignored by Deloitte. As explained at
the Hearing on Quantum, although TNG expected to load the LPG Plant from its
own gas, the LPG Plant could also be used to process gas from other producers.
The Joint Operating Agreement for the operation of the LPG Plant between
Ascom, Terra Raf, TNG, and Vitol confirms that the processing of third party gas
was anticipated. The 2009 RBS Assessment also assumed that the LPG Plant
would be loaded with third-party gas, based on discussions with KMG E&P.
(CPHB 1 {{{[ 563 — 567, 570).

1707. Deloitte disregards the possibility that TNG could have sold the Plant to a third
party that had its own gas run through the plant. KMG E&P, for example, made an
indicative offer of USD 199 million for the LPG Plant in September 2008, based
on a mixed comparative value and cost approach — not a DCF analysis. KMG
E&P’s use of the cost basis to value the LPG Plant contradicts Kazakhstan’s
argument that the cost basis is an improper valuation method. The 2009 RBS
Assessment valued the LPG at USD 86 million (base case) to USD 146 million
(high case) and the Tribunal should agree that these are the absolute minimum
amounts that the Tribunal should award for the LPG Plant. (CPHB | {{{[ 569 —
572).

1708. Claimants explain that Mr. Chagnoux was not a credible witness. His explanation
that he was dishonest in his bid of USD 100 million for the LPG Plant may be

attributed to hurt feelings that Claimants did not initially consider his offer to be
good enough to move to Phase 2 of the sale process. On cross, he admitted to not
being present at a March 2009 meeting about which he provided testimony. It also
appeared that he and Total were interested in currying favor with Kazakhstan.
(CPHB | {{{[ 390 — 391).

Respondent’s allegations about delays in the construction of the LPG Plant are
based on a draft business plan that indicated a target start date of October 2007.
The planned launch, however, was Q2 2009. Even if there were a delay, however,
it would not shorten the usable life of the plant. (CPHB | {{{[ 577 — 578).

In response to Respondent’s allegation that the LPG Plant was speculative from the
beginning, Claimants explain that “Using the valuation metrics that Mr. Broscaru
described in his witness statement, Deloitte attempts to create a cash flows and a
valuation model that it concludes had a value of US $108.2 million. Deloitte,
however, makes a fundamental error in its calculation. Mr. Broscaru stated that
TNG expected the LPG Plant to generate US $1 billion in revenue and US $500
million in profit over 10 years. Deloitte, however, spreads those cash flows over 20
years, effectively cutting them in half. FTI has corrected Deloitte’s error, and
concludes that an accurate ‘simplified model’ results in a positive NPV of US $92
million.” (CPHB 1 1.579, partially quoted).

The RBS valuation was based on (1) the 2009 reserve report prepared by Miller
Lents; (2) detailed legal due diligence by Squire Sanders; (3) detailed financial, tax,
and environmental due diligence by PWC; (4) discussions with management of
KPM and TNG; and (5) “valuation discussions with KMG EP.” It was created as an
independent valuation for the purpose of a potential transaction, not litigation. It
concluded that, on 1 October 2009, the combined enterprise value of Tolkyn,
Borankol, and the LPG Plant was USD 612 million in the Default-Base scenario, to
USD 760 in the Special-Base scenario which assumed higher gas prices. This
represents an alternative valuation which should establish a minimum value for
these assets, if the Tribunal rejects the 14 October 2008 valuation date. The
Tribunal should, however, draw the inference that it understates the value of these
assets. (CPHB | {583 — 585).

2. Arguments by Respondent

The LPG Plant is a failed project. Claimants have failed to prove either claim for
USD 245 million or USD 408 million for the LPG Plant and they have failed to
provide a salvage valuation for the LPG Plant. (R-II {| 163 — 164). Claimants
initially intended to only invest USD 20 million into the project, but as alleged in
its first post-hearing brief, expended USD 179 million — 800% of the anticipated
amount. They expected it to be fully operational by the third quarter of 2007 but —
almost two years after this projected operation date — the project remained
unfinished, and Claimants abandoned it. Its value is zero. (R-III {J 139 — 140; R-I
453.3; RPHB | {{{[ 812, 894; RPHB 2 If] 652, 657).

It is unclear whether Claimants maintain their demand for lost opportunity to make
a success of the LPG Plant. The termination of the construction of the LPG Plant,
however, cannot be associated with any actions by the Republic. Mr. Broscaru
received orders to stop construction due to TNG’s cash constraints. Mr. Broscaru’s

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 375 of 415
Page 374 of 414

allegation that non-Kazakh workers were unable to renew their work permits in
November/December 2008 (which is implausible and is denied) was first adopted
in Claimants’ First Post-Hearing Brief. Mr. Broscaru provided no substantiation of
the claim that the work permits issue affected construction, nor was there a
statement of what work could not be done since workers were unavailable. (RPHB
2 ¥M[ 688 — 697, 105 — 111).

1714.Claimants suggested that the Republic interfered by causing TNG’s liquidity
position to deteriorate, but this is incorrect — those developments related to the
Credit Suisse loan and, as confirmed by the PwC Due Diligence Report, were
outside of the Republic’s influence. Similarly, since there was no harassment
campaign, Claimants’ assertion that the harassment campaigned made their
decision to suspend construction be appropriate is empty. In testimony, it became
obvious that either Anatolie Stati or Mr. Broscaru lied about the decision to
“postpone” or to abandon the LPG Plant project. (RPHB 1 115; RPBH 2 {fj 108 -
109).

1715. At the Hearing on Quantum and in the Third Report, GCA explained the steps and
costs that would be necessary to commission the LPG Plant, would amount to
approximately USD 100 million, USD 32 million of which due to Claimants’
“mothballing” the equipment. Claimants have not provided a credible cost
estimate, and the Hearing on Quantum demonstrated that Ryder Scott had no
expertise on capital expenditure. FTI, on the other hand, could not justify their
assumption that USD 24.1 million would be necessary — FTI relied completely on
information provided by TNG. In particular, FTI relied on the “Tristan Oil Interim
Financial Report For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008”, a document
that was drafted in November 2008 but discusses the forward looking costs until
June 2008. FTI errs in its costs assumptions:

921 FTI’s approach becomes totally striking when looking at what happened to
FTI’s valuation in their second report. In their second report FTI applied a
fair market value of the LPG Plant based on the allegation that TNG had
not spent a total of USD 208.5 million as alleged in the first report but a
total of USD 245 million. Applying the same logic that FTI had applied in
their first report, they should have reassessed the costs for the completion
of the plant and arrived at costs of USD 232.6 million as envisaged by
TNG for the construction of the plant minus the USD 245 million actually
spent to construct about 80-90% of the plant.

922 Therefore, FTI in their second report should not have simply stuck to USD
24.1 million to finalise the construction as they did. Instead, FTI should
have assumed that TNG would not need to pay USD 24.1 million to
construct but rather TNG should be paid USD 12.4 million to construct the
plant. This is obviously bogus, yet apparently good enough for FTI.
(RPHB | 1] 909 — 922, partially quoted; RPHB 2 1] 688 - 697).

1716. Claimants sought to mislead potential investors, as well as the Tribunal, about the
economic viability of the LPG Plant. Once Claimants’ costs and recovery
estimates were proven incorrect, Claimants sought to hide this information from
the Tribunal and potential investors. At the Hearing, Mr. Lungu admitted to lying
in { 27 of his first witness statement. He also conceded that the construction of the
LPG Plant had been a story of constant delay, exceeded budgets, and changing

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 376 of 415
Page 375 of 414

assumptions about the availability of gas. This is obvious when considering the
iginal business plan, which envisaged costs of USD 105 million — not USD 281
million. It assumed commission in the third quarter of 2007 — not in 2009, as
written by Mr. Lungu. Mr. Lungu conceded these points in oral testimony.
Claimants’ statements that the document was a draft with no value were
contradicted by the witness. The vendor due diligence report indicated that there
had been no delays in construction of the LPG Plant and that it would be completed
on time and within budget. In cross-examination, Mr. Lungu explained this to
mean that there was no delay, so long as the plan was adjusted from time to time,
so as to become the original plan. (RPHB | {{{[ 813 — 846, 864 — 869; RPHB 2 {{{f
657 — 659). In the rebuttal, Claimants did not rebut any of the evidence regarding
the failure of the LPG Plant. (RPHB 2 {ff 653, 657 — 659).

 

1717.Claimants have withheld from the Tribunal that they actually assumed — in the
PwC Due Diligence Report, that up to USD 60 million would be needed to
complete the LPG Plant. In that Claimants have exceeded the projected costs for
the LPG Plant by 250%, the estimate of USD 20 — 60 million could be adjusted to
USD 40 - 150 million, which is in line with GCA’s estimate. (RPHB | {fj 925 —
928). Their assumption of costs of USD 60 million, the amount applied by RBS,
given TNG’s history of exceeding estimated costs, makes Respondent’s
assumption of USD 100 million more likely. Claimants have not provided proof or
a position of costs for the completion of the LPG Plant. (RPHB 2 {[ 688 — 692).

1718.Mr. Lungu tried to hide the LPG Plant cost explosion from the Tribunal and from
its own auditors. FTI attempted to explain that the price increase for the LPG Plant
could be explained by reference to Kazakh inflation, but this argument is seriously
flawed. First, it is inconsistent with FTI’s use of the 1.6% US inflation rate to
forecast the costs of the LPG Plant construction. It disregards the initial USD 105
million estimate that was provide in the Ascom LPG Business Plan, allegedly
prepared by Vitol. FTI disregards the ultimate of USD 281 provided in Mr.
Broscaru’s witness statement — oddly, because that estimate was provided to Mr.
Broscaru by Mr. Lungu. In any event, the PwC Due Diligence Indicates that the
USD 281 cost estimate was correct. As a result, FTI assumes a cost increase of
53.5% (from USD 151.5 million to USD 232.6 million) rather than in increase
cannot be explained to the inflation development of 67.9% in 2007 and 2008 cited
by FTI. (RPHB 2 {{f 453 — 458).

1719. Deloitte has estimated that the unfinished LPG Plant has a negative enterprise
value of USD — 89.9 million. They arrive at this using the DCF method, which
RBS, Deloitte, and bidders in Project Zenith had no problem applying. Deloitte
considered projections of future sales revenues and expenses, including the USD
100 million expenditure required to complete the LPG Plant. Deloitte derived the
net cash flow over several years as the balance of revenues and expenses projected
and arrived at a negative number. This indicates that alternate uses of the LPG
Plant need to be considered. (R-II ff 145 — 147, 152; RPHB 1 {[ 812; RPHB 2 7
652, 672).

1720. Deloitte GmbH assumed a start-up date of 2011, which is consistent with the RBS
valuation. Nevertheless, even taking account the processing of gas from June 2009
— June 2011, the value of the plant would still be negative. FTI’s valuation of the

1721.

1722.

Page 376 of 414

LPG Plant would only be 7% lower if gas production between 14 October 2008
and 21 July 2010 was disregarded. (RPHB 2 {{{| 698 — 699).

Deloitte reaches this negative value because the LPG Plant could only be operated
for four years, due to TNG’s limited supply of gas. After four years, capacity
utilization will fall below the minimum level required for technical operation and
negative cash flows will be generated. Claimants were aware of this as of 2009
when, although the business plan was created under the assumption of the
availability of 40.2 - 62.3 Bem’ to run the plan, the Miller Lents Report informed
them that they only had 9.5 Bem’ — enough for 4 years. Claimants’ valuation
expert, Mr. Rosen, already conceded that the LPG Plant could not operate
economically on the gas from Tolkyn and Borankol, alone. It would only be
economically viable if Claimants’ assumed gas volumes from the Contract 302
properties and gas from third parties would be available. No effort, however, was
undertaken to test the viability of these assumptions or to see whether it would be
possible to extract suitable gas from the CAC Pipeline. While KazTurkMunai was
mentioned as a company that could deliver gas to the LPG Plant, no information
about the amount of gas was provided. Ignoring the fact that the GCOS for
Contract 302 was 5% and that they forwent exploring it, Claimants treated it as
100% for the purposes of assuming that it would supply gas to the LPG Plant. As
for the so-called geographically proximate gas sources, Claimants and Mr.
Broscaru failed to identify any specifically. All that Claimants have is the RBS
Report that assumed gas from third parties could be processed in the Plant. (R-II
ql 141 — 142, 146, 148, 165, 173; RPHB 1 870 — 882; RPHB 2 {{ 657, 700 — 705).

Regarding gas from the Contract 302 property, even if Claimants had not foregone
the opportunity to explore it, the Deloitte report confirms a maximum GCOS of 5%
for the Interoil Reef, which combined with the ECOS, makes it commercially
unexploitable. At the Hearing on Quantum, Claimants failed to show how the LPG
Plant could be operated economically, but demonstrated why construction was a
failure, in that it was supervised by incompetent personnel. Although he made
several statements regarding the economic parameters of the project, in cross-
examination, it became clear that Mr. Broscaru had no idea about the economics of
an LPG Plant. He used numbers, like the alleged value of USD 450 million that he
obtained from Mr. Lungu who, obviously, did not want to be scrutinized on these
numbers and did not put them in his own statement. He was unable to support his
other written statements during cross. He conceded that the Munaibay discovery
could only support the plant for 6 months, and that the Tabyl discovery could only
support it for three days and a few hours. It was obvious that the reference to
Munaibay could not have included the Interoil Reef. Finally, the only possible
conclusion that the Tribunal could draw from Mr. Broscaru’s testimony that “/his]
action focused only on technical surveillance of the work and the facility” is that
the Tribunal should disregard every detail that does not only concern the technical
details of the LPG Plant. Finally, the Tribunal should also note that Claimants’
witness statements from Anatolie Stati and Mr. Broscaru regarding the LPG Plant
are inconsistent. (RPHB 1 {{{[ 847 — 863).

The Claimants’ witnesses, Mr. Lungu, Mr. Broscaru, and FTI provided incredible
testimony regarding the LPG Plant. Mr. Lungu’s testimony regarding the LPG
Plant misrepresented all basic parameters of that project. Everyone except FTI
agreed that Claimants should never have taken the decision to build the LPG Plant.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 378 of 415

19 — 20. Mr. Broscaru, in cross examination, could not answer even basic
questions about his witness statement entitled “Design and economic rationale of
the LPG Plant” because he had received all of his information from Mr. Lungu and
had simply written that into his statement. Apparently, Claimants sought to
insulate Mr. Lungu from cross-examination regarding the financial aspects of the
LPG Plant. FTI calculated that the assumed value of the LPG Plant of USD 450
million was overstated by up to USD 443 million. Corrected, and based on the
assumptions set out in Mr. Broscaru’s witness statement, FTI should have arrived
at a negative value for the LPG Plant. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 19 — 20, 26 — 28).

1724. With respect to the processing of gas volumes from the Borankol and Tolkyn
fields, Claimants’ valuation scenario concerning the LPG Plant is to determine the
book value of the LPG Plant. Yet, Claimants instead apply a “book value” which
is identical to the “investment value” — namely, the total capital invested in the
LPG Plant. A hypothetical buyer will not be interested in how much cash was
invested in the business, but only in the cash he or she would get out of the
business in the future. Further, the “investment value” ignores developments after
investment, such as inflation, deflation, and currency developments. Scholars have
also confirmed that the investment value does not reflect its FMV, even for
business valuation experts. Thus, it is not suitable as an indication for FMV in a
treaty arbitration, either. (R-II {{] 179 — 186). The investment value (USD 245) is
irrelevant and, indeed, the investment value and the FMV are utterly
disproportionate to each other. The investment itself was a black hole for
Claimants’ investments and, in the end, Claimants invested USD 245 million for
the unfinished LPG Plant. The LPG Plant would have costs USD 269 — USD 345
million to finish — grossly higher than the USD 105 which they originally
estimated. (R-II {{] 174 — 178).

1725. The alleged USD 208.5 “book value” of the LPG Plant — defined as the investment
value less accumulated depreciation — is, likewise, irrelevant. This method is not
used for determining a FMV and scholars agree that it has no relationship to market
values or to asset values. Rather, “book value” was created for accounting or tax
evaluations. The vast majority of arbitral tribunals regard book value as an
inappropriate basis for the calculation of compensation. (R-III {{[ 143 — 144, 187 —
195). In any event, Claimants failed to demonstrate that the necessary conditions —
including a secured gas supply, an established market for LPG products, and a
market for remaining dry gas — existed for the book value of the LPG Plant to be a
valid proxy for FMV. (R-I {ff 53.16 — 53.17).

1726.Claimants use the book value method because the FMV method leads to a lower
compensation. (R-III { 195). With adjustments like the “impairment test” or the
“mark-to-market process”, as required by international accounting standards, a
book value can be made to reflect the actual FMV. FTI ignored the impairment of
the LPG Plant mentioned in the Tristan Oil Annual Report for 2009, which would
adjust the book value negatively. (R-III {J 196 — 199; RPHB 2 {[ 706).

1727.The RBS valuation report conducted as part of the KMG EP Due Diligence in
September 2009 and which Claimants consider to have been prepared by “world
class experts” proves that Claimants’ valuation of the LPG Plant, and other assets,
are bogus. The RBS report estimates the value of the LPG Plant to be between
USD 47 — 86 million, with a median of 67 million that is dependent on availability

of unsubstantiated third-party gas. This valuation disproves Claimants’
exaggerated claims for the LPG Plant. The values that RBS attributed to the LPG
Plant, even under the assumption that third party gas would be available, are
nowhere near the costs that TNG incurred for constructing the plant, and are even
further from FTI’s “prospective valuation.” (RPHB 1 {| 825 — 828, 986 — 987,
989).

RBS, even when taking third party gas into account, only arrives at a value of
negative USD 4 million to USD 67 million for the LPG Plant. This supports
Respondent’s view that Claimants’ decision to build the LPG plant was fatally
wrong. Applying RBS values, Claimants invested USD 245 million to create an
asset that, in the best case scenario, had a value of only USD 67 million. They lose
between USD 245 million and USD 178 million as a result of building the plant.
(RPHB 2 {ff 829 — 832).

In the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Rosen conceded that Claimants were seeking
USD 87,077,000 in overcompensation for the FMV of the LPG Plant. Leaving
aside his other errors, Mr. Rosen stated that FMV of the LPG Plant should be
determined on a cost basis, and was, therefore, worth USD 245 million — not the
USD 329 million that Claimants claim. Apparently, Claimants increase their FMV
by adding an “uplift” for the processing of gas from the Contract No. 302
properties, which they assume will be available. This “upliff” factor is, in effect,
double counted since it is already taken into consideration in the FMV.
Respondent denies that an uplift would have occurred absent delays in
construction. Due to the lack of demand for gas at the time, the Tolkyn production
was severely curtailed and there would, as a result, have only been a very limited
gas supply for the LPG Plant. (RPHB | {{{[ 883 — 891; RPHB 2 {ff 110).

FTI’s Mr. Rosen confirmed at the Hearing 2 that he determined the value of the
LPG Plant on the cost basis because his assumption (based on Mr. Broscaru’s
witness statement and the assumption that Contract 302 and third party gas from
the CAC Pipeline) that it was a going concern. The LPG Plant, however, was
never a going concern — it would have been uncommercial to complete and operate
the plant. All of Mr. Rosen’s assumptions are unproven. There was no guarantee
of gas from the Contract 302 properties. There was no guarantee of gas from the
CAC Pipeline. Claimants, finally, have produced no evidence of their parties to
supply gas to the LPG Plant. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 678 — 687).

Also, the cost basis is not an appropriate violation approach because prospective
buyers consider the future income potential of an asset. The cost approach is not a
suitable way to arrive at a FMV, even if the asset is not yet generating cash flows
because it relies on the untenable assumption that the LPG Plant would be
profitable. On top of that, the approach is illogical, awarding different damages
based on the amount actually spent. Even the KMG EP, in Project Zenith, agreed
that for the formation of a binding offer, the DCF method — and not a cost-based
approach — would need to be applied. (RPHB 1 {{] 897 — 906; RPHB 2 {If 672 -
677).

Claimant’s’ “prospective valuation” of the LPG Plant has been tainted by their
unrisked valuation of the Contract 302 properties. Thus, even Mr. Rosen’s cost
basis approach is based on a 2% chance that significant amounts of gas could be

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 380 of 415
Page 379 of 414

economically produced from the supposed Interoil Reef. Any investor, however,
would take the risks and the GCOS into account. (RPHB | {892 — 893).

1733.Mr. Broscaru makes the unsubstantiated assertion that the net present value of the
LPG Plant would reach USD 450 million. FTI then used this number in their
calculation to arrive on a value of USD 7 — 92 million, depending on the run time
of the plant. Claimants instructed Mr. Broscaru to refuse to answer questions
regarding these assumption. In any event, FTI admits that this is a gross
miscalculation of at least USD 358 million, 38 pages later. In any event, even on
their own assumptions, TNG should have arrived at a net present value of the LPG
Plant of USD 51.2 million, even assuming a 20-year run-time. FTI made this error
by understating the discount rate, disregarding administrative costs, and failing to
consider tax — not to mention failing to consider the availability of third party gas.
FTI desperately tries to assist Claimants by conveniently disregarding documents
(Ascom LPG Business Plan) and by applying irrelevant US inflation (thereby
driving capital expenditure down and increasing the prospective valuation) rather
than Kazakh inflation. (RPHB 2 {{ 661 — 671).

1734. Deloitte identified two additional methodological errors by FTI. These include that
FTI used the same discount rate for the “prospective” valuation of the LPG Plant as
for their other valuations, which was incorrect since FTI applied different tax rates
to the LPG Plant. The applicable discount rate was, thus, understated by 1% and
the prospective value of the LPG Plant was, therefore, overstated by USD 20.3
million. Costs were also underestimated and this resulted in an overstatement of
value by USD 3.3 million. (RPHB 1 {| 580).

1735. Claimants’ claim for a portion of the “prospective value” of the LPG Plant is bound
to fail because it neglects even known certainties and risks (like the expiration of
Contract. 302). While they based their initial prospective value on the assumption
that gas from third parties and Contract 302 would be processed, they now provide
the prospective value to compensation for the situation that the Interoil Reef may
have been discovered and found to produce appropriate volumes of gas. FTI has
adjusted their “prospective value” from USD 408 million, to USD 329 million, to
USD 308.7. The absurdity of FTI’s calculation is obvious when compared to the
USD 67 million valuation that RBS arrived at — under the assumption that the LPG
Plant would work at full capacity for 20 years. (RPHB 2 {[{[ 707 — 713).

1736.Regarding the third party assessments of KPM and TNG’s value, including the
LPG Plant, the representative of KNOC, Total E&P, KMG EP and OMV have
confirmed that their bids did not represent FMV. Instead, they were made to gain
access to the data room and further investigation would be needed before arriving
at FMV. As confirmed by Mr. Suleymenov’s testimony at the Hearing on
Quantum, their bids were made based on limited information and they were often
made for strategic and not valuation driven reasons. (RPHB | {| 974 — 977). At
Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Chagnoux explained that his bid on behalf of Total E&P
was artificially high because Claimants’ investment bank had conditioned access to
the data room on higher bids. Mr. Chagnoux confirmed that he believed the LPG
Plant to have a negative value. (RPHB 1| {{[ 200 — 202; 978 — 979).

1737. The Republic never had any intention of completing construction in the LPG Plant.
Preservation work was initiated beginning in March 2009. Costs associated with

this preservation would need to be deducted from the USD 245 million allegedly
spent until that time. As to the operation of the LPG Plant, since Claimants
abandoned the plant, KMT (which subsequently assumed the trust management
responsibilities of KMG NC) has been forced to employ guards to protect the Plant
and re-employ minimal staff to avoid social tension. Claimants have given no
explanation as to why the application at Exhibit C-583 in any way indicates that
KMG is making plans for the future of the LPG Plant. (R-II {{ 714; C-583 is
undated). Turning to the “List of Investment projects of the Mangistauskoi Region,
which are being supervised in 2011...”, the content of that is not attributable to the
Respondent as it did not arrange for such a document to be published. At best, it
should be considered as mere promotional material. Contrary to Claimants’
contention, the Republic is not training experts to run the LPG Plant. (R-III {{{[ 203
— 207; RPHB 1 {{{[ 895 — 896).

Another relevant aspect, ignored by Claimants, is the Vitol Joint Venture
Agreement. Under that Agreement, Claimants would not have kept 100% of the
future profits allegedly arising from the operation of the unfinished LPG Plant.
Respondent does not have the specifics of the Vitol Joint Venture, but many
aspects were provided through Mr. Lungu’s testimony. Respondent puts Claimants
to proof that the proceeds they could have earned operating the LPG Plant under
the Joint Venture Agreement are more than half of whichever asset value they are
claiming. (R-II {J 208 — 211; RPHB 1 {{{[ 907 — 908; RPHB 2 { 729).

The Republic denies Claimants’ contentions regarding alleged decision by Vitol to
retract its investment in the LPG Plant, which in any event would not be
attributable to the Republic. (RPHB 2 {[ 111).

Vitol is also a factor in the costs analysis. Claimants have admitted that of the
USD 245 million in damages for investment costs that they demand, at least USD
66 million were contributed by Vitol. TNG’s alleged investment costs are, at best,
therefore, USD 179 million. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 279 — 270).

At the most, the Tribunal could award not more than 50% of any of the assumed
value to Claimants, if it were to assume liability and if it were to assume a positive
value for the LPG Plant. Claimants, however, are not entitled to damages because
the unfinished LPG Plant was never taken from Claimants — they abandoned it.
The value of the LPG Plant is negative. What Claimants seek is compensation for
the loss of the Plant. It is undisputed that Vitol, Ascom, TNG, and Terra Raf
entered into a Joint Operating Agreement on 27 June 2006, pursuant to which the
bulk of the profit of the LPG Plant would be generated by the Joint Venture
Company — not TNG. Ascom would only own 50% of the shares in the company.
If they now demand compensation for an alleged treaty breach, at most they can
demand 50% of the asset value, since neither TNG nor Ascom would have received
more than 50% of the profits of the LPG Plant. Accordingly, depending on how
the Tribunal issues its award, whether based on the “prospective value”, the “cost
basis valuation”, the RBS valuation, that amount would need to be halved.
Anything more would be unjust enrichment. Claimants have failed to produce
evidence of any “obligations toward Vitol” that would change this. (RPHB 2 {ff
656, 714 — 728).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 382 of 415
Page 381 of 414

1742. Since the LPG Plant has a negative enterprise value, Claimants are, at best, entitled
to the salvage value of its components. Prof. Marboe and the World Bank agree
that it is recommended to use “the salvage value for the valuation of companies
which do not have a proven record of profitability.” Likewise, this measure has
been used by arbitral tribunals if they consider the business to lack future
prospects, due to an expropriation (Eastman Kodak y. Iran) or due to social and
economic changes in wake of the Iranian Revolution (Sola Tiles v. Iran). The
tribunal in Sedco v. IMICO used the salvage value to determine FMV in wake on
an expropriation. Tavakoli v. Iran also considered valuation based on the
liquidation value. Claimants’ expert FTI even acknowledged that salvage value
must be used when it stated “we assume that the plant would not continue to
operate under negative cash flow conditions and would be sold to another
producer of natural gas.” (R-II {¥ 153 — 162; see also R-I {{[ 53.18 — 53.20).

3. The Tribunal

1743. First, in addition to an application of the Tribunal’s considerations in the chapter on
causation above in this Award, the Tribunal has no doubt that Respondent’s actions
found above to be in breach of the ECT, in particular were a cause for the delay
and then discontinuance of Claimants’ completion of the LPG Plant.

1744.In fact, President Nazarbayev himself confirmed this in his Instruction of 19
November 2009 (C-23, attached to Blagovest letter). And, this was further
confirmed by MEMR in its Report on its inspections of January 2010 (C-599,
Minutes of Inspection of TNG, January 25 — February 5, 2010, at 23).

1745.The Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent’s and their experts’ conclusion that
the LPG Plant is a failed project and must be considered to have a negative value
and no damages at all can be claimed by Claimants. If that were so, Respondent
would not have been ready to invest further expenses in the completion of the
Plant, after Respondent had taken control of the Plant. However, there were
obviously plans to complete it. Publicly available information indicates that
Respondent was in fact preparing to open the LPG Plant in 2012. In a document
entitled “List of Investment projects of the Mangistauskoi Region, which are being
supervised in 2011,” there is a specific reference to the LPG Plant under “Regional
Projects” The project is identified as having a cost of USD 315 million (47 billion
Tenge) and it was expected to start up in the first half of 2012 with a capacity of 7
mem of gas per day (2nd FTI Report § 7.7 and fns. 138 and 139). Respondent’s
argument that it cannot be identified with this document is not persuasive. The
LPG Plant was also listed on website of Kazakhstan’s Embassy in Israel under the
caption “Large Investment Projects in Kazakhstan through 2012” with the same
project costs (FTI 2nd Report § 7.7 and fn140).

1746. Regarding the value of damages caused by Respondent’s action, the Tribunal has
taken note of the various extensive arguments submitted by the Parties relying on
their respective experts’ reports. However, the Tribunal considers that it does not
have to evaluate these reports and the very different results they reach. In the view
of the Tribunal, the relatively best source for the valuation in the period of the
valuation date accepted by the Tribunal are the contemporaneous bids that were
made for the LPG Plant by third parties after Claimants’ efforts to sell the LPG
Plant, both before and after October 14, 2008. Prospective purchasers bid on the

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 383 of 415

Page 382 of 414

Plant, not as scrap but obviously as prospectively operational. This is reflected in
the undisputed indicative offers made by interested buyers in 2008, which valued
the LPG Plant at USD 150 million on average. In this context, the Tribunal is not
persuaded by Respondent’s argument that these offers did not reflect the
anticipated price bidders were ready to pay, but were only strategic offers to gain
access to the data room. In this context, the Tribunal attributes a limited evidentiary
value to the testimony of Respondent’s witnesses from KNOC and Total E&P,
since these foreign companies remain active investors in Kazakhstan and, thus, for
understandable reasons, have an interest to maintain a good relationship with the
government of that country.

1747.On the other hand, the Tribunal considers it to be of particular relevance that an

1748.

offer was made for the LPG Plant by state-owned KMG at that time for USD 199
million. The Tribunal considers that to be the relatively best source of information
for the valuation of the LPG Plant among the various sources of information
submitted by the Parties regarding the valuation for the LPG Plant during the
relevant period of the valuation date accepted by the Tribunal, the Tribunal.

Therefore, this is the amount of damages the Tribunal accepts in this context.
L.VIl. The Parties’ Arguments Concerning the Tristan
Notes

1. Arguments by Claimants

1749. Claimants explain the Tristan note structure:

571. The notes that were issued by Tristan Oil Ltd., [...] provided a portion of
the capital for construction and operation of the KPM and TNG oil and
gas assets [...] Tristan issued notes with a face value of US$ 531.1
million, which matured on January 1, 2012. While Tristan is the nominal
principal obligor on those notes, Tristan is a special purpose entity that
was created solely for the purpose of raising capital through the note
issuance to fund KPM and TNG. It has no operating assets with which to
repay the notes. The expectation of all parties involved, including the
Tristan noteholders, was that KPM and TNG oil and gas operations would
provide the funds to repay the principal and interest on the Tristan notes.
Consequently, KPM and TNG guaranteed repayment of all obligations
under the Tristan notes. (C-II { 571).

1750. Taistan has an integral relationship to Claimants, TNG, and KPM ~ and this

1751

was in ’s of Defense. Any
disposition of Claimants’ interest in, or assets of, KPM and TNG requires
arrangements to satisfy the Tristan note principal and interest held outside of, but
guaranteed by, TNG and KPM. This was reflected in indicative offers received in
Project Zenith. (C-III {fj 91 — 92, partially quoted; see also C-II {572 - 575).

- That Claimants are allowed to claim for damages to the noteholders if Claimants

are liable to the noteholders for such alleged damages is permissible was conceded
by Respondent in its Rejoinder on Quantum. The only issue before the Tribunal is

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 384 of 415
Page 383 of 414

whether there is a causal link between the State’s illegal conduct and the
companies’ inability to satisfy their debts. (CPHB 1 {| 602 — 606).

1752.In large part, Respondent’s arguments with regard to the Tristan debt rest on the
assumption that the Tristan debt is true third-party debt for which Claimants have
no liability. This is incorrect, as “Claimants: (1) have always been obligated to
repay the Tristan noteholders from the proceeds of any award; (2) further
reinforced that obligation through the Sharing Agreement, and (3) have repeatedly,
consistently, and unequivocally undertaken before this Tribunal (and for the
avoidance of doubt, hereby commit and undertake yet again) to repay the Tristan
noteholders from the proceeds of any award under the procedures set out in the
Sharing Agreement.” Ascom and Terra Raf are also liable to repay the Noteholders,
pursuant to Section 6 of the Pledge Agreement. (CPHB | {| 617 — 620, partially
quoted; CPHB 2 {{ 321).

1753.Claimants explain that they are responsible for the Tristan debt, which was issued
with a fact value of USD 531.1 million and matured on | January 2012. Under the
note structure, Tristan issued the notes. Tristan is an SPV with no assets that loaned
the proceeds of those notes to KPM and TNG. The expectation was that KPM and
TNG would repay the notes from their profits. KPM and TNG guaranteed
repayment of all obligations under the notes. Ascom and Terra Raf also pledged
100% of their Participation Interests in KPM and TNG (all of their equity in the
companies) and the money to be received with respect to those interests as security
for the Tristan notes. Contrary to Respondent’s reading of the Pledge Agreements,
the claims would not be limited to the value of the shares pledged. Section 6(b) of
the Pledge Agreements broadly applies to any and all dividend and other payment or
distributions of any kind relating to the Participatory Interest, without restriction.
This language is broad enough to include the benefit of payments Claimants receive
as compensation for Kazakhstan’s mistreatment of expropriation of the companies.
(CPHB | {J 621 — 625).

1754.Claimants also point out that “as Squire Sanders noted in its legal due diligence
review for KMG E&P, transfer of the participation interests pursuant to the Pledge
Agreements is subject to the State’s preemptive right under Article 71 of the Subsoil
Law. That raises the prospect that Ascom and Terra Raf may be unable to deliver
their Participation Interests in KPM and TNG to the noteholders, and instead would
receive compensation from Kazakhstan for those shares upon the State’s exercise of
its preemptive right. It thus stands to reason that a key purpose of the provision in
Section 6(b) was to ensure that the noteholders received the benefit of any payments
from Kazakhstan in respect of Ascom and Terra Raf’s Participation Interests in KPM
and TNG. That is exactly what an award in this arbitration would represent, albeit
as the result of violations of the ECT rather than through the legitimate exercise of
Kazakhstan's preemptive right.” (CPHB 1 { 625).

1755.Claimants reject Respondent’s interpretation of the Pledge Agreement as it would
require Claimants to press unreasonable, aggressive arguments in an effort to “stiff”
creditors to mitigate losses and reduce damages that Respondent must pay. (CPHB
1 [ 626).

1756. The Sharing Agreement is only relevant insofar as it confirms Claimants’ intention
to perform their contractual obligations to the Tristan noteholders — it has no bearing

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 385 of 415
Page 384 of 414

on the calculation of damages due as of the valuation date. The Pledge Agreements
always obligated Ascom and Terra Raf to turn over any proceeds of this arbitration
to the Tristan noteholders. The Sharing Agreement simply reorders the respective
priorities of the Claimants and the Participating Noteholders so that Claimants will
share in any proceeds of this arbitration. On 14 February 2013, the Sharing
Agreement was accepted by 99.8% of the noteholders, effectively amending the
notes and related security arrangements for all noteholders. The Sharing Agreement
did not create or materially alter Claimants’ obligations regarding the Tristan debt.
Instead, it was a renegotiation of Claimants’ existing obligations and not a voluntary
assumption of new liability. The suggestion that Claimants voluntarily assume
liability to share 70% of any award when they had no obligation to do so is absurd.
The Sharing Agreement does not materially reduce Claimants’ basic liability under
the Tristan debt, either. It is a private matter between Claimants and the noteholders
and has no bearing on Kazakhstan at all. (CPHB | {{{[ 626 — 630, 632; CPHB 2 {i
325 - 327).

1757.The fundamental purpose and effect of the Sharing Agreement is to provide both
sides with a clear set of agreed rights and obligations for the event that the award in
this arbitration is less than requested by Claimants. In such event, Claimants will
share in the award and, if noteholders have recovered at least 70% of the amount
outstanding, will receive a total release in 2016. In exchange, the noteholders will
ensure that Claimants are incentivized to pursue collection of any award (which may
not be in Claimants’ interest if Claimants are not to receive proceeds), and also to
receive a right to approve any settlement. The Sharing Agreement changes the
order of allocation of any award proceeds between Claimants and noteholders, until
the noteholders are fully repaid. (CPHB 1 {{{[ 631, 636).

1758.Claimants explain how, against the background of the Sharing Agreement,
awarding equity would unjustly enrich Respondent at Claimants’ expense.

[...] if the assets of KPM and TNG that Kazakhstan seized had a fair
market value of US $1 billion and the outstanding Tristan debt were US
$531 million, the value of Claimants’ equity in KPM and TNG would be
US $469 million. If the Tribunal awarded just the equity value (US $469
million in this example), that entire amount would go to satisfy Ascom and
Terra Raf’s liability to the Tristan noteholders under Section 6 of the
Pledge Agreements (without considering the impact of the Sharing
Agreement, which is discussed below). In other words, an award of equity
value would in fact give Claimants less than the full value of their equity
because some (and perhaps all) of the award would go to satisfy liabilities
to third parties that, but for Kazakhstan’s violations, would have been
satisfied with the profits of KPM and TNG. In contrast, an award of the
enterprise value (US $1 billion in this illustrative example) would satisfy
Ascom and Terra Raf’s liability to the Tristan noteholders, leaving
Claimants with the value of their equity interest in KPM and TNG (US
$469 million in the example), free and clear of all debts. Thus, an award of
enterprise value is the proper measure of compensation to put Claimants
in the position they would have occupied but for Kazakhstan's violations.

[...] an award of equity value would unjustly enrich Kazakhstan by
allowing it to obtain assets unencumbered by liabilities for a fraction of
their value. In the same example, for instance, an award of equity value

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 386 of 415

1759.

1760.

1761.

Page 385 of 414

would allow Kazakhstan to obtain assets worth US $1 billion while paying
only US $469 million to Claimants. Claimants’ subsequent payment to the
noteholders under the Pledge Agreements would effectively eliminate any
claims that the noteholders may have against the assets of KPM and TNG,
or against Kazakhstan itself (to the extent that the noteholders have any
claims directly against Kazakhstan, which to date they have never
asserted). Thus, an award of equity value in this illustrative example would
allow Kazakhstan to keep assets worth US $1 billion while paying only US
$469 million, and without facing any further liabilities. In contrast, an
award of the enterprise value (US $1 billion in this example) would require
Kazakhstan to pay the full value of the assets its expropriated, and would
not subject Kazakhstan to any further liability (because any claims of the
noteholders would be extinguished by Claimants’ performance of their
obligations under the Pledge Agreements). (CPHB I {J 634 — 635).

2. Arguments by Respondent

The principal on the Tristan notes must be deducted from the asset values
calculated by Claimants’ expert since, due to the peculiarities of the securing
mechanisms, Claimants can practically no longer be liable for and cannot claim the
noteholders’ alleged damage. Under Claimants’ own case, due to the alleged
breach of the ECT, Claimants are practically not liable to the noteholders. In any
event, Claimants do not have standing to claim the noteholders’ alleged damage.
Further, the shares must be worthless, due to Respondent’s allegedly illegal action.
Thus, any claim by noteholders could not create a loss for Claimants. Assuming
that there was a breach of the ECT, this would amount to a financial gain,
advantageous to Claimants. Thus, it does not matter that Respondent did not
assume or perform KPM’s and TNG’s guarantee obligations, as Claimants allege.
(R-II {379 — 383, 389 — 390; RPHB 2 {J 923, 945).

Even if Claimants were not freed from liability, their claim for recovery of the
Tristan note principal would fail. Under the Chorzéw principles, which the Parties
agree apply here and according to which “compensation must wipe out the effect of
the allegedly expropriatory state action” (looking to the situation that would have
existed absent the alleged breach of international law), Respondent is not liable for
the Tristan note principal. With or without breach, Tristan Oil would have been
liable for the Tristan note principal and Claimants would have been acting as
guarantors for the debt. There was no worsening of the situation through the
Respondent’s allegedly illegal actions. Claimants must have been aware of this,
only including a claim for principal in passing in their Reply Memorial on
Quantum. (R-III {ff 392 — 393; RPHB 1 {| 1068; RPHB 2 {J 940 — 941).

Under the Chorzéw principles, compensation is to be achieved according to the
FMV of an asset. The FMV takes the asset’s debt into account. After all, a willing
buyer would never simply pay the enterprise value, since debt infringes on the
buyer’s ability to realize profits from the purchase. The so-called Sharing
Agreement entered into on 17 December 2012 foresees that proceeds from an
award in this arbitration will be shared between Claimants and the noteholders in a
roughly 30% / 70% split. Claimants effectively admit that the equity and not the
enterprise value is the appropriate tool to value the assets when they base their
claim on the idea that the Sharing Agreement acts as a security for the debt.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 387 of 415
Page 386 of 414

However, they essential argue that, if the debt is not added, the amount awarded
would immediately go to the noteholders, leaving nothing for Claimants. Notably,
Claimants did not try to gross up their claim by adding the debt that they continue
to owe for taxes, which would also be deduced from an award. Investment practice
strongly disfavors tax gross-ups, even when those are based the argument that an
award in their favor would be subject to higher levels of taxation than the profits
they would have been expected to make without interference. (RPHB | {| 1056,
1068 — 1074, 1097 — 1098).

1762.It should also be noted that Claimants do not allege that they are liable for
noteholder debt no matter what. Instead, they state that that liability would only
come into existence with an award. Then, they attempt to gross up the award by
adding this debt to their damages. Claimants were never liable for the debt. It is
not the case that Claimants had been supposed to hold the cash flows created by
KPM and TNG and would then forward those to noteholders. Instead, repayment
would go through Tristan, who is not a Claimant. (RPHB | {{ 1078; RPHB 2 {J
941 — 942). Section 6 of the Terra Raf and Ascom Pledge Agreements create no
liability for those Claimants toward noteholders. It only refers to dividends and
distributions and, therefore, excludes payments from a hypothetical award. (RPHB
2 ql 945 — 948).

1763.The claim for recovery for interest and penalties must also fail. It has not been
shown that any Tristan noteholder has brought a claim against Claimants for the
note interest, penalties, or principal or that Claimants have paid anything to
noteholders. Absent this proven damage, the claim must be dismissed. None of
the Claimants remain liable for any of the noteholder debt, not even as a result of
the Pledge Agreements. Under Section 6 of Ascom’s and Terra Raf’s Pledge
Agreements, KPM and TNG only pledged to pay shareholders as part of a payout
of equity. Payments by third parties (such as a payment of an award), are not
dividends or distributions, meaning that, therefore, the noteholders are not entitled
to them. (R-II {{ 394; R-I {{[ 57.1 — 57.3; RPHB 1 {I 1075 - 1076).

1764.In any event, any liability based on the Sharing Agreement is Claimants and not
Respondent’s. Respondent cannot be held liable for Claimants’ unilateral action.
(RPHB | {ff 1077, 1188).

1765. In response to Claimants’ allegation that, if the Tribunal does not award the Tristan
rate, it should include interest that has accrued on the Tristan notes since 14
October 2008, Respondent states that this allegation does not hold water. Even
without a breach of international law, Tristan Oil would have been liable for the
note principal, and for the interest payments. Further, Respondent cannot be liable
for interest between 14 October 2008 and | July 2010, since Tristan only failed to
make interest payments starting on 1 July 2010. Finally, since Claimants have
never specified the amount of interest that accrued during the time period,
Claimants’ claims related to Tristan Note Interest should be rejected in their
entirety. (RPHB 2 {| 1014 — 1018).

1766.Even if the Claimants had suffered damage, a debt gross up is contrary to
international law and arbitral practice (as demonstrated in Impregilo v. Pakistan
and Dr. Stern’s dissent in the Occidental case, and PSEG v. Turkey) and would
enable the noteholders to circumvent jurisdictional and substantive hurdles of their

1767.

own potential claims. There is no reason to assume that the Parties to the ECT
intended that individuals could attach themselves onto another individual’s claim to
circumvent the ECT’s requirements. Like in Jmpregilo where the investor was not
permitted to present claims of his joint venture partner, here, too, the Claimants
should not be permitted to present this claim on behalf of noteholders. Claimants
attempt to vest this Tribunal with jurisdiction to decide on the interpretation of the
pledge agreements, even though they have agreed in those pledges that an ICC
tribunal will have jurisdiction. Respondent’s general offer to arbitrate contained in
the ECT does not entail an offer to have matters regarding the interpretation of
private contracts be arbitrated as well. In addition, if Claimants are successful, it
will have the practical consequence that Claimants serve for the noteholders to
realize the noteholders’ claim. (RPHB | { 1085 — 87; RPHB 2 {{{{[ 934 — 939, 944,
950).

Even if there were such a claim from a noteholder, the Claimants have failed to
prove causation, namely that the alleged action of Respondent prevented timely
payments to be made on the Tristan notes. Instead, any damages suffered could
have been caused by a variety of reasons, including the economic crisis, falling oil
prices, poor business decisions, or the Guarantors’ debt overload. (R-II {{{[ 395 —
396; R-II {| 723).

3. The Tribunal

The Tribunal recalls its considerations above in this Award in the chapter on the
treatment of debts. In particular, it recalls the following conclusions regarding the
Tristan Notes:

Regarding the Tristan Notes as the by far largest debt, Respondent expressly
agreed in its Rejoinder on Quantum (R-II {[ 383) that, insofar as Claimants remain
responsible for the Tristan debt, enterprise value is the correct measure of damages.
While Respondent’s statement at the May 2013 hearing may perhaps be understood
as changing that position, it did not attempt to reconcile its prior statement and the
Tribunal still agrees with Respondent’s earlier position.

Based on the information before it, the Tribunal concludes that Ascom and Terra
Raf are still liable to repay the noteholders pursuant to Section 6 of the Pledge
Agreement. That provision expressly includes in the payments to be made to the
pledgeholder “other payment or distribution of any kind.” The Tribunal sees no
reason why this general language should be restricted to payments of KPM and
TNG alone as Respondent has argued at the May 2013 hearing (Tr. day 1, pp. 246
and 247). Quite to the contrary, if Claimants, in the present arbitration, would not
claim the value of the Tristan debts, they might be held liable for not pursuing the
interests of the pledgeholders.

Having again examined the Parties’ specific arguments summarized above
regarding the Tristan Notes, the Tribunal confirms that these conclusions need not
be changed and that no reduction of any damages found is due to the Tristan Notes.

L.VII. Moral Damages

1. Arguments by Claimants

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 389 of 415
Page 388 of 414

1772. Respondent has conceded that “moral damages are permissible” and that they may
be awarded in the following exceptional cases in investment treaty arbitrations,
such as where:

- the State’s actions imply physical threat, illegal detention or other
analogous situations in which the ill-treatment contravenes the norms
according to which civilized nations are expected to act;

- the State’s actions cause a deterioration of health, stress, anxiety, other
mental suffering such as humiliation, shame and degradation, or loss of
reputation, credit and social position; and

- both cause and effect are grave or substantial. (C-II { 617, quoting from
R-I 55.2).

1773.The events here, including the prosecution and imprisonment of KPM’s in-country
manager, were exactly those which would warrant the Tribunal, in its discretion, to
award moral damages, in an amount of at least 10% of the total compensatory
damages awarded to Claimants. (C-III {{] 95 - 97). While it is an exceptional
remedy, this is a case where such an award is appropriate:

96. There are only a modest number of investment treaty cases on record in
which a state’s mistreatment of an investor was so severe, intentional, and
multi-faceted as Kazakhstan’s treatment of Claimants in this dispute.
There are even fewer cases on record in which that treatment was
admittedly ordered by the Respondent’s Head of State and carried out by
dozens of state organs and instrumentalities over a period of years.
Claimants have demonstrated that the mistreatment they suffered, while
exceptional by investment treaty standards, was part of a “playbook” that
Kazakhstan’s rulers have employed in similar contexts. Claimants have
also shown that awards of moral damages are becoming increasingly
accepted in investment treaty practice, as demonstrated by the recent
award in Desert Line v. Yemen. (C-III J 96).

1774.Respondent’s idea that a moral damages awarded requires a precise repeat of the
events at issue in Desert Line is nonsense. Rather, Respondent has identified a
framework within which moral damages can be awarded, and Respondent’s
conduct fits that framework. Here, there was an actual, illegal imprisonment and a
threat that all of Claimants’ general managers would meet the same fate. By July
2010, Respondent had succeeded in driving Claimants’ key personnel from
Kazakhstan out of fear of imprisonment. It was the stress and anxiety to Desert
Line’s executives and the injury to Desert Line’s credit, reputation, and prestige
that caused that Tribunal to award moral damages. The parallels between that case
and this one are striking. The fact that Mr. Cornegruta escaped from the false
imprisonment does not absolve Respondent of liability. This Tribunal has
discretion in awarding a figure that it finds most appropriate to compensate for the
harm suffered by Claimants, and is not limited to the USD 1 million awarded in
Desert Line. (C-II {{f 619 — 623; C-I {| 453 — 464; CPHB 1 {{ 659).

1775.Claimants remind the Tribunal that the claim for moral damage is a claim for
Claimants’ moral suffering. Claimants suffered through years of Kazakhstan’s
misconduct. Respondent has not disputed Mr. Cojin’s testimony that KPM and

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 390 of 415
Page 389 of 414

TNG’s managers worked in Kazakhstan under threats and harassment, while being
targeted, monitored, and followed by the Financial Police, before they were finally
forced to flee the country. Kazakhstan has a responsibility to compensate
Claimants for the stress, anxiety, mental anguish, and reputational harm that it
imposed on them through its intimidation tactics, false criminal accusations,
defamation, and the ultimate seizure of its assets. (CPHB 1 {{[ 658 — 663). The
Tribunal should exercise its discretion to award substantial moral damages to
Claimants. (CPHB 2 { 395).

2. Arguments by Respondent

1776.Claimants’ claim for moral damages is disingenuous, at best. First, that the
Republic’s actions with respect to Mr. Cornegruta and the search of KPM’s and
TNG’s premises on 6 May 2009 were legal and proper. This bars any claim for
moral damages. The allegation that it was an aggressive and intimidating raid is
based only on Mr. Stejar’s statements, which lacked credibility and contradicts the
testimony of Mr. Rakhimov. Second, Claimants have not suffered any moral harm
that would warrant an award for moral damages in the amount claimed. (R-II {{]
499 — 501; RPHB 2 {{f 1025 — 1031).

1777.While the Parties agree that moral damages may be awarded in exceptional
circumstances, these do not exist in the present case. The Lemire requirements
have not been fulfilled. Further, this case is distinguishable from the Desert Line
case, where armed tribes attacked the investor’s premises and the Yemeni military
put the premises under siege. The 6 May 2009 search, as demonstrated in
unchallenged witness testimony, was conducted by “unarmed officers [who] took
[the] utmost care to carry out the search without creating more disturbance than
necessary.” Accordingly, it cannot serve as the basis for a claim of moral
damages. (R-II {{[ 502 — 507; R-I 55.2).

1778.An award of moral damages would only benefit Anatolie and Gabriel Stati —
neither of whom has suffered any more harm in the present case. The person who
allegedly suffered moral harms, Mr. Cornegruta, is apparently not on speaking
terms with Anatolie. Stati and has not been involved in this arbitration. Moral
damages to Messrs. Stati, as a result of Mr. Cornegruta’s imprisonment, have not
been proven. (R-III {{[ 508 — 513, 1028).

1779.Claimants have since toned down their initial demands for compensation, the
previous calculation of which was extraordinary and reminiscent of US-style
punitive damages. Claimants are claimed moral damages of at least USD 272.87
million (10% of the claimed USD 2,728.2 million). Not only has no investment
award for moral damages ever come close to such an amount, there is no case that
points to moral damages being calculated as a percentage of the compensatory
damages award. Indeed — there is no necessary connection between the tangible
and moral harm allegedly suffered (i.e. “there is no connection between the
financial losses following from the assets being taken into trust management and
the alleged stress and anxiety supposedly following from the May 2009 search or
the imprisonment of Mr. Cornegruta.”). (R-II {J 514 — 518; R-I {{[ 55.2 — 55.3,
RPHB 2 {| 1031).

 

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 391 of 415

Page 390 of 414

1780.Insofar as these damages are disguised punitive damages, there is no basis in
international law for such an award, and tribunals have firmly rejected claims for
punitive damages in the past. (R-III {[ 518).

3. The Tribunal

1781.The Parties agree that a claim for moral damages can only be justified in
investment treaty cases in very exceptional circumstances.

1782. Therefore, Claimants, having the burden of proof, must meet a very high threshold
to show a liability for moral damages.

1783. Indeed, as Claimants concede, there are only a modest number of investment treaty
cases on record in which a state’s mistreatment of an investor was so severe,
intentional, and multi-faceted as Kazakhstan’s treatment of Claimants in this
dispute. There are even fewer cases on record in which that treatment was
admittedly ordered by the Respondent’s Head of State and carried out by dozens of
state organs and instrumentalities over a period of years.

1784. Obviously, the present case is distinguishable from the Desert Line case, where
armed tribes attacked the investor’s premises and the Yemeni military put the
premises under siege. The Tribunal further agrees with Respondent that the Lemire
requirements have not been fulfilled.

1785. While, above in this Award in the chapter on liability, the Tribunal has identified a
timeline of conduct by Respondent that it considers must be viewed together and
concluded to be a breach of its ECT obligation to provide FET, the Tribunal did not
accept Claimants’ characterization that this was a “playbook” by Respondent. And
even if this were so, this would not by itself mean that moral damages are due.

1786. Without having to go into detail on the general question whether and under which
exceptional circumstances awarding moral damages might be justified in
investment treaty cases, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants have not fulfilled
their burden of proof for facts that would make it necessary to examine that
question any further.

L.IX. Tax Claims
1. Arguments by Claimants

1787.Claimants do not address tax issues in their Reply Memorial on Quantum and state
that tax assessments are not at issue in the Quantum Hearing. Claimants do not
seek to recover any tax payments as damages. They protest the inclusion of the
Balco expert report and argue that the tax assessments, which were part of the
harassment campaign, were part of the liability phase. Neither the Deloitte report,
the Balco report nor the Rahimgaliev witness statement relies on the validity of the
tax assessments for valuation calculations. The report and the second Rahimgaliev
witness statement are an improper backdoor attempt to get liability issues heard in
this quantum hearing. (C. ltr. to Tribunal 10.12.12). Claimants’ arguments
concerning the validity of the tax assessments are found at C-II {{{[ 233 — 236.

Page 391 of 414

Respondent’s tax claim is part of Respondent’s campaign to harass Claimants.
Deducting it from amounts owed to Claimants would be contrary to international
law. In any event, USD 62 million (USD 81.2 million in CPHB 2) is not the actual
amount that Claimants would owe if Kazakhstan’s legal argument were correct.
Respondent has not presented evidence of the actual amount that the net tax debt
would be, even if the legal argument were correct. (CPHB | {| 648 — 649; CPHB
24 133).

The USD 62 million tax claim was manufactured and, as Scott Horten and PwC
confirm, is part of a well-recognized strategy that Kazakhstan uses to pursue
investors who have fallen out of favor with the President. The claim is incorrect on
the merits. Claimants were entitled to use the rate contained in Art. 20, and that
contained in Art. 23 Tax Law contradicts the clear wording of the Subsoil Use
Contracts. Even if Respondent were correct, however, the back taxes owed would
be less than USD 62 million, as Prof. Balco agreed, since the issue would not be
whether, but when, the drilling expenses could be deducted. Kazakh domestic
courts resolved this issue in favor of Claimants, making this issue largely
academic. (CPHB | {{{[ 238 — 261).

Procedurally, Respondent has raised this issue as a counterclaim. It has done this
belatedly and solely to reduce the compensation owed to Claimants. If the
Tribunal nevertheless decides to consider this claim, Kazakhstan bears the burden
of proving that the position is correct (that taxes are lawfully owed), as well as the
amount of taxes owed. Kazakhstan has proven neither. The corporate income tax
dispute is a cash-flow issue that exclusively concerns the timing of deductions for
drilling expenses — even if Kazakhstan’s arguments were correct, Claimants would
likely only owe a small fraction of the sum claimed because KPM and TNG could
deduct all or nearly all of the drilling expenses, by today. (CPHB 2 {J 133 — 134).

2. Arguments by Respondent

In part, Claimants’ damages are based on an alleged improper assessment of taxes
and duties against them. Tax issues have a significant impact on valuation.
Respondent maintains that the assessments were made in accordance with the law
and that Respondent is not liable for them. Respondent also applied the
appropriate amortization rate. This is supported by Mr. Balco’s expert report. (R-
III {{ 366 — 373).

Any claim will need to be set off against the amount which Claimants owe
Respondent due to their failure to correctly declare their taxable income. (R. ltr. to
Tribunal 13.12.12). For KPM from the period | January 2005 to 31 December
2007, an additional 3,257,446.00 thousand Tenga was payable. For TNG for the
same period, TNG is liable to pay an additional 5,906,027.2 thousand Tenga. (R-
III { 368).

In its First Post Hearing Brief, Respondent calculated that KPM and TNG are liable
for more than USD 81.2 million in tax debt, including penalties. Claimants admit
that corporate back taxes were never paid by KPM or TNG. Claimants’ dispute
relates to the question of which amortization rate to apply to the companies’
exploration expenses for 2005 — 2007. The tax committee applied the rate set out
in Art. 23 of the applicable tax law (25%), but Claimants allege that the 100% rate

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 393 of 415
Page 392 of 414

set out in Art. 20 should have been applied. Squire Sanders and PwC have
confirmed that Respondent has applied the correct 25% rate. This was also
confirmed in the expert report by Prof. Balco, which was not contested by
Claimants. (RPHB | {{[ 1057 — 1061; RPHB 2 {{f[ 963 — 965).

1794.Claimants wrongfully focused on the types of activities (own-account
construction), rather than the purpose of the activities, which is the focus of the
Kazakh Tax Code and the Subsoil Use Agreements. The Tax Code offers different
depreciation rates on expenses relating to exploration and extraction, and those
related to processing, including own-account construction and acquisition of
equipment. This distinction is clear when viewing the grammatical interpretation
in the Russian version of Art. 20 and 23 of the Tax Code. The language of the Tax
Code and the Subsoil Use Agreements is consistent. None of Claimants’ expenses
referred to production (processing of new materials). Thus, Prof. Balco concluded
that KPM’s and TNG’s expenditures were for exploration. The applicable tax
depreciation rate for exploration under Art. 23 is 25%. (RPHB 2 {| 966 — 974).

1795. Respondent explained that the Tax Committee’s February 2009 assessment did not
constitute a reversal of a prior tax assessment, and this was confirmed by Mr.
Rahimgaliev in the Hearing on Quantum, as well as in Claimants’ own vendor due
diligence of August 2008 which sets out the periods and types of taxes for which
audits had been conducted. (RPHB | {J 1061 — 1062).

1796. Kazakh courts have confirmed the correctness of the Tax Committee’s position. A
clear look at the decision of the Supreme Court of 3 November 2010 overruling the
decisions of the appellate and cassation courts demonstrates that Claimants’
position was not vindicated, but rather was groundless. The Supreme Court’s
decision was reasoned and based on the proper construction of the relevant
legislative position. The Court did not change a previous position, as alleged by
Prof. Maggs. The decisions cited by Prof. Maggs (10 June 2008 and 11 February
2009) addressed only the point in time at which a taxpayer may claim an incentive.
Neither case concerned whether the 100% depreciation rate could be applied to
own-account construction expenditures. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 975 — 982).

1797.Even if the relevant wells were fixed assets, KPM and TNG would have had to
have applied different depreciation rates. Claimants failed to identify which wells
were put into operation to either the Tax Committee or to the Kazakh courts.
Claimants have also not provided a calculation for the impact of higher deductions
in later years. They have the burden to prove these deductions. Accordingly, the
amount of at least USD 81.32 million of tax debt, as calculated by PwC, is
unchallenged. (RPHB 2 {| 983 — 987).

3. The Tribunal

1798.The Tribunal recalls its timeline, above in this Award in the chapter on liabilty of
Respondent’s conduct, through which it found Respondent to be a breach of its
ECT obligation for FET. It further recalls its conclusions, above in this Award in
the chapter on the relevance of debts, insofar as they deal with tax assessments.

1799. There is no doubt that an investor must pay taxes in the host country, as assessed
by law. However, there is also no doubt that these tax assessments may be

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 394 of 415

Page 393 of 414

abusively made in breach of the ECT. All of the alleged back tax obligations were
created by and during Respondent’s conduct after October 2008 which this
Tribunal found above to be a string of measures in breach of the ECT. Indeed, the
tax assessments were a major part of this string of measures. As the disputed tax
assessments were all retro-active assessments for back taxes which had not been
sed during the earlier period before October 2008 when relations between
Respondent and the Claimants were still normal, Respondent has the burden of
proof that these disputed back tax assessments after October 2008 were not part of
this breaching conduct.

 

1800. KPM and TNG prevailed in their court challenges of the tax assessments. The only

1801

appellate decision in favour of Respondent was issued after the seizure of the
investment in a review process alleged by Claimants to have been conducted
without their knowledge or participation. The decision of the Supreme Court of 3
November 2010 overruling the decisions of the appellate and cassation courts does
not appear to the Tribunal to show a fair and independent assessment. Rather, the
Tribunal tends to agree with Prof. Maggs that the Court changed a previous
position compared to previous decisions cited by Prof. Maggs (10 June 2008 and
11 February 2009). This decision of the Supreme Court, in the judgment of the
present Tribunal, is not sufficient to fulfill Respondent’s burden of proof that the
assessment would have been the same without Respondent’s breaching conduct.

 

- Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that no deduction for Claimants’ tax obligations

are to be made from the damages found to be due for the ECT breaches.

L.X. Relevance of Cliffson SPA and Other Factors in
Establishing Fair Market Value (FMV)

1. Arguments by Claimants

1802. The best evidence of the value of Claimants’ investments as of 21 July 2010 is the

actual, then-pending Cliffson transaction — a deal that would have closed, but for
Respondent’s interference. Claimants ask the Tribunal to contrast the low values
that Respondent has assigned to the assets with the terms of the arm’s length
Cliffson transaction, which was pending at the time of the seizure. Claimants and
Cliffson executed a comprehensive SPA on 13 February 2010 for all of Claimants’
equity interests in TNG, KPM, and Tristan to Cliffson for USD 267 million, and
Cliffson agreed to assume all of those companies’ liabilities, totaling more than
USD 655 million. This places the entire value of the deal for Claimants’ distressed
assets at approximately USD 924 million. All that stood in the way of this deal
was (1) Respondent’s waiver of pre~ emptive rights and (2) MOG approval. In
response to Claimants’ li and

initiated a final inspection blitz that led to the expropriation of Claman! assets on
22 July 2010. (C-III {| 5— 7; CPHB 1 {{[ 586, 596; CPHB 2 {{ 371).

1803. The Cliffson transaction remained pending until at least 7 June 2010 when Cliffson

sent a letter to the MOG stating that it no longer wished to pursue the transaction.
Cliffson did not inform Claimants of this letter, and Claimants only saw this letter
when it was produced in this arbitration. (CPHB | {{ 587).

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 395 of 415
Page 394 of 414

1804. Respondent has argued that Claimants’ story regarding the Cliffson negotiations is
not credible. Anatolie Stati never stated that the first time Claimants had
discussions with the principals was in February 2010. The Cliffson transaction was
an arm’s length transaction. Discussions began in November 2009 with an
Assaubayev company called Grand Petroleum, which had access to the Project
Zenith data room. The only unusual aspect to the negotiations with the
Assaubayevs was the preliminary MOU that the Aussabayevs executed in
November 2009 that included a preliminary price commitment, which was later
changed. The MOU shows that the Aussabayevs were insiders who knew the value
of the assets that they were purchasing and that they knew that they were
purchasing them at a distressed value. (CPHB 1 {[{] 588 — 592; CPHB 2 {{{[ 371 —
373).

1805.The fact that the transaction did not close was a result of Respondent’s action.
Respondent’s representation that Cliffson failed to take steps necessary to close the
deal mischaracterizes the evidence. Anatolie Stati’s letter of 9 March 2010 is no
indication that Cliffson had backed away from its obligations. The letter focused on
Cliffson’s failure to perform its obligations in the Side Letter agreement to bring a
halt to the governmental harassment of KPM and TNG. Cliffson repeatedly told
Claimants that they were working on obtaining government approval. The fact that
government approval never came is a good indication that the government’s
harassment campaign was very effective and that Cliffson was unsuccessful in
ending it. It is not evidence that it had re-evaluated its decision to purchase. In any
event, as FTI explained, absent a reason to believe that Cliffson’s re-evaluation of
value was the reason that the transaction did not close, the agreed price is a reliable
indicator of the value of the non-consummated transaction. (CPHB | {593 — 596;
CPHB 2 {[ 373).

1806. Claimants’ letter to Cliffson of 15 June 2010 reflects concern that Cliffson backed
out of the transaction to because Kazakh authorities were planning to auction
KPM’s assets to satisfy the criminal penalty. (CPHB 2 { 375).

 

1807.In previous sub: ons, Claimants have argued that the bids received in Project
Zenith are a fair indication of the FMV of the properties, absent the State’s
harassment and indirect expropriation measures. (C-I {[ 73). Regarding Project
Zenith, Claimants only argue that the offers received there serve as evidence that
the right to export / the future receipt of international export prices was reasonably
contemplated in 2008. (C-III { 10). Claimants maintain that Respondent has not
shown that the bids received in that project were in any way inaccurate or
incomplete. (C-II { 399).

2. Arguments by Respondent

1808.Rather than provide a valuation for the correct date of 21 July 2010, Claimants
instead refer to the Cliffson SPA of 13 February 2010 and allege that this SPA
reflects a value of USD 924 million for KPM and TNG. (R-II { 397).
Respondent’s summary is best taken from its own words.

(a) The Cliffson SPA is no reflection of the fair market value. From its
contents and from the little time the parties took to enter into it, the
Cliffson SPA appears as a highly atypical agreement that raises doubts as

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 396 of 415

1809.

1810.

1811.

Page 395 of 414

to whether there were serious negotiations regarding the value of the
companies and as to whether a proper due diligence was conducted. It can
hence not be described as an arm’s length transaction.

(b) In fact, from documentary evidence and the statements made by Claimants’
witnesses at the hearing, it appears that soon after the conclusion of the
SPA, Cliffson itself realized that it had agreed to an inappropriately high
purchase price. As a result, Cliffson tried to wiggle its way out of the SPA
later on.

  

(c) In any event, the Cliffson SPA does not contain information sufficient in
order to allow a proper assessment of its value. (R-III J 398).

Regarding the argument that Cliffson had insufficient time to properly assess
KPM’s and TNG’s value, the evidence shows that not more than 13 days of due
diligence and negotiations were conducted before the SPA was concluded, and
Cliffson was granted no guarantees or company-specific information. This is
atypical for a contract valued at nearly USD 1 billion — in fact, Total E&P and
KMG EP needed substantially more time - six months and four months,
respectively - to come to their decision. The brevity and vagueness of the SPA also
reveals a lack of proper due diligence. For example, major contracts and licenses,
pending lawsuits, major debt, and other characteristics of the companies that could
be important for their value are either not mentioned at all or are not set out in any
detail. This lack of specificity is atypical of a proper M&A transaction. Thus, the
Cliffson SPA was not likely an arm’s length transaction. Even if the Cliffson deal
was a fair market transaction at arm’s length, however, the Cliffson SPA does not
provide sufficient information for a proper valuation. Any calculation reached by
FTI cannot be accepted as the actual value of the Cliffson SPA. (R-II {{{ 397 —
405, 412; RPHB | {{[ 997, 1003). In addition, at the Hearing on Quantum,
Claimants introduced a new background to the Cliffson transaction, one that would
have it date back to September 2009. This is not credible. (RPHB 2 { 8).

That the Cliffson transaction cannot be seen as an arm’s length transaction,
conducted on a reasonable information basis is supported by Mr. Lungu’s
testimony when he stated that Cliffson simply relied on information from the
government and looked at KMG EP due diligence documents to assess the
potential of the deal, without ever assessing Claimants’ data room. The only part
of that testimony that Mr. Lungu could know for sure was the proposition that the
Assaubayev family did not assess the data room — everything else was speculation
or invention. If the Assaubayev family had seen the KMG EP due diligence, they
would not have made an offer based on a supposed enterprise value of USD 1.15
billion as alleged at the Hearing on Quantum, or USD 920 million as initially
alleged. The Assaubayevs cannot have had access to the KMG EP valuation.
(RPHB | {{{[ 1116 — 1020; RPHB 2 {J 865 — 866).

Cliffson also attempted to hinder the closing of the SPA, concluding that it had
agreed to pay more than FMV. Under the SPA, two important closing conditions
needed to occur: (1) the Republic had to waive its pre-emptive rights and (2) the
MOG had to approve the transfer. Although Cliffson was responsible for making
the necessary applications, Claimants made them — and then only 2 months after
the SPA was concluded. Cliffson’s lack of cooperation was apparent and
recognized by Claimants. Cliffson did not provide the information required by the

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 397 of 415
Page 396 of 414

MOG for approval or by the Republic for the waiver, possibly in breach of section
4.2 of the SPA, as recognized by Anatolie Stati. Cliffson effectively hindered the
deal from being closed. (R-II {{{[ 406 — 411).

1812.Claimants continue to withhold details of the circumstances of the Cliffson deal.
At the Hearing on Quantum, both Anatolie Stati and Mr. Lungu were caught in lies
regarding when they had made contact with the family behind Cliffson. They
revealed strange details about changes in the purchase price that, if true, should
have been revealed at an earlier time because they would have supported a higher
damages price, supported negative inferences with regard to KMG EP’s valuation.
The fact that these details were first elaborated in direct testimony shows that
Claimants wished to avoid serious cross examination on those matters. Mr.
Calancea was also evasive about questions. The story that has been given
continues not to add up. In addition to Anatolie Stati and Mr. Lungu contradicting
each other, Mr. Lungu’s statement also contradicted prior documents on the record.
His statement that Claimants were unaware of Cliffson’s desire to “back our” is
contradicted by the evidence and is inconsistent with Claimants’ Opening
Presentation at the Hearing on Quantum. (RPHB | {fj 116, 998 — 1015; RPHB 2 {|
865 — 867).

1813.Claimants now argue that the Cliffson transaction actually began in November
2009 with a MOU between Grand Petroleum and Claimants. No documentation
has been provided of this, despite the fact that Claimants would have been entitled
to submit so much under PO-10. (RPHB 2 {[ 869).

1814.Respondent has demonstrated that the Republic’s authorities cooperated with
Claimants in the process of obtaining state consent and the waiver of preemptive
rights. Claimants, however, failed to provide sufficient documentation to the
authorities — documents which remain outstanding to date. At the Hearing on
Quantum, Mr. Lungu’s testimony demonstrated Claimants’ admission that it was
ultimately Cliffson that backed out of the transaction, due to their own financial
troubles. This makes their previous arguments about state impediments irrelevant.
(RPHB | {{{[ 998 — 1001; RPHB 2 {{ 870).

1815.Claimants’ arguments that are based on Anatolie Stati’s letter of 9 March 2010
misstate that evidence. That letter shows that Claimants were accusing Cliffson of
not taking the necessary steps for the implementation of the SPA, meaning that
Cliffson was backing out of the transaction. It indicated a lack of progress on both
the implementation of the SPA and the Side Letter. (RPHB 2 {| 871).

1816.Respondent denies that Cliffson was obliged to work back channels to obtain
governmental approval for the sale. Not only would such an obligation be
unenforceable, there is no documentation of such an obligation. (RPHB 2 {[ 872).

1817.Finally, Respondent objects to Claimants’ suggestion that the Tribunal should
exercise its discretion to increase the amount of damages based on the Cliffson
SPA. There is no basis in international law for a discretionary increase of
damages. (RPHB 2 {{ 873).

1818. Regarding basing a recovery on an alleged FMV, as Respondent reiterated in the
Hearing, the non-binding offers made during the first phase of Project Zenith also

cannot serve as an indication of Claimants’ properties’ FMV as of October 2008.
The representatives of KNOC, Total E&P, KMG EP, and OMV have confirmed
that their bids did not represent FMV. Instead, as confirmed by Mr. Chagnoux’s,
Mr. Seitinger’s, and Dr. Kim’s testimony, they were made to gain access to the
data room and were pushed up by Renaissance Capital. As confirmed by Mr.
Suleymenov’s testimony at the Hearing on Quantum, their bids were made based
on limited information and they were often made for strategic and not valuation
driven reasons. Dr. Kim of KNOC and Mr. Seitinger of OMV confirmed at the
Hearing on Quantum that their bids were the result of optimistically high gas price
assumptions, which were driven by the Renaissance Capital Information
Memorandum and its reference to the KazAzot Tripartite Agreement. The
Information Memorandum admittedly “does not purport to be comprehensive” and
“has not been independently verified” and is based in part on unaudited financial
statement. Thus, it is not a basis to produce a FMV. Even representatives of
KNOC, Total E&P, and KMG EP testified that the information was not sufficient
to make a FMV decision. In any event, bidders made bids for reasons that had
nothing to do with FMV. As Claimants admitted at the Hearing on Quantum,
bidders bid for strategic reasons, often after pressure from Renaissance Capital, in
order to gain access to the data room. The only bids that somewhat matched the
indicative value were those for Tolkyn, but those were inflated by unverified
assumptions. In FTI’s Additional Expert Report of 25 January 2013, Claimants
claim an unrealistic FMV for USD 197 million for Borankol and USD 497 million
for Tolkyn. (R-II {{[ 447 — 450; RPHB 1 {974 — 986; RPHB 2 {{{[ 803 — 806).

Indicative offers were also based on the reserves estimates in the 2008 Miller &
Lents Report, which were massively overstated as compared to the estimates
provided by Ryder Scott and GCA in this arbitration. “The 2008 Miller & Lents
Report provided for 2P reserves of 141.3 mmboe. Even Ryder Scott estimated 2P
reserves of only 97.7 mmboe as of their valuation date. Assuming the highly
overstated Ryder Scott estimates were correct, the indicative bids would thus still
be based on a reserves report which overstated 2P reserves by further 40%.
Importantly, the overstatement related primarily to the estimates for valuable
liquids production from the Tolkyn field.” (RPHB 2 4 806).

The offers made based on the Information Memorandum and the vendor due
diligence ranged from USD 0.55 billion to USD 1.55 billion. Regarding the
individual assets the ranges were as follows:

(a) USD 90 mn and USD 248 mn for Borankol;
(b) USD 367 mn and USD 1.067 bn for Tolkyn; and

(c) USD 70 and USD 280 for the LPG Plant. (R-III J 451).

These ranges show that they do not reflect a FMV. At most, the indicative offers
could show that Claimants have overvalued their assets. Other circumstances
include Claimants’ ramping up of production in 2008, the 2008 spike in oil prices,
and the non-conclusion of the Tripartite Agreement. (R-II {{[ 455 — 471; RPHB 1
(il 974 — 975). Claimants rely on favorable bids and ignore circumstances that
show that these bids were above FMV, as well as lower bids. (R-III {| 452 — 454).
The bids do not support Claimants’ and FTI’s valuation suggestions. This has not
been addressed by Claimants. (RPHB 2 {| 807 — 808).

Page 398 of 414

1822.Finally, even though these bids were exaggerated, Claimants’ claims in this
arbitration exceed what the bidders were offering. This is particularly true for the
LPG Plant — the highest bid for that was USD 280 million, and Claimants have
increased their estimate of the prospective value of that plant to USD 408.3
million. For the Borankol field, Claimants claim USD 231.5 million, even though
the average of the indicative bids was USD 151.8. (R-II {{{ 472 — 475).

1823.At the Hearing on Quantum and as explained above, Claimants put forward
arguments about alternative valuation methods, including the comparable
transactions analysis, the comparable companies’ analysis, and the “implied value
based on market value of debt” methods. Each of these strongly supports
Deloitte’s and disproves FTI’s findings. (RPHB | 4 1021).

3. The Tribunal

1824. The Tribunal has taken note of the extensive submissions by the Parties on their
different views regarding the relevance of the Cliffson SPA and other factors in
establishing FMV.

1825. However, the Tribunal’s considerations in the Award, above, rely for the valuation
of the damages due on factual and legal grounds that are independent from the
above issues disputed between the Parties. Therefore, while the Tribunal
understands why the Parties have been involved in that dispute, it need not enter
into an examination of these issues for its decisions on the claims raised.

L.XI. Credibility of the Parties’ Experts
1. Arguments by Claimants

1826.GCA and Deloitte’s work is utterly unreliable. GCA’s work is largely a “black
box” - it failed to produce the working papers underlying its conclusions because
none exist. Instead, the documents and data that GCA produced were nearly all
created by someone else — either Ryder Scott or State institutes. Only 20
megabytes of the 20,810 megabytes of data produced were GCA’s own
independent work product. The scant original work produced for Contract 302 —
the Prospect Risk Assessment and the Crystal Ball documents — are deficient.
Respondent’s argument that they are more thorough and revealing than Ryder
Scott’s demonstrate a profound ignorance of the prospect evaluation process,
which involves seismic research and interpretation. If GCA had provided the maps
upon which they relied, one could give them credit for documentation of the work,
but their supporting documentation consisted of a piece of paper with number and
no explanation of their origin. (CPHB 2 {| 330 — 331, 338 — 339).

1827.Ryder Scott produced 6510 megabytes of original, independent work product.
(CPHB 2 { 331)

1828.The Deloitte TCF valuation was not tested by cross-examination, and Kazakhstan
has explained that there was no reliance on it. Mr. Gruhn testified that the Deloitte
GmbH report was completely independently prepared. There are, however,
numerous differences between these two valuations, and Deloitte GmbH must
explain the bases for these differences, which to date have not been explained.

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 400 of 415
Page 399 of 414

These include the gas price scenarios, the LPG Plant scrap value, and the value of
the Contract 302 properties. Combined, these resulted in a reduction of the total
calculation of the damages from USD 229 — 237 million to USD 186 million — a
decrease of approximately 20%. Claimants provide the following chart to
demonstrate the differences (CPHB 1 {{{[ 505 — 512):

2. Arguments by Respondent

1829.Claimants have attempted to argue that the RBS Report fully accounted for the
impact of market factors, the effects of the global financial crisis, the effect of a
year of additional production in KPM and TNG, the watering in the fields, the
effects of additional compression costs according to GCA, and the effect of lower
reserves in the Miller Lents report. This is not, however, the difference between
the RBS and FTI values. Rather, those values differ in terms of asset value
assumptions. None of the factors listed by Claimants’ counsel depressed RBS’s
valuation. Claimants’ depiction of the RBS values is devastating not for
Respondent, but for Claimants and FTI. (RPHB 2 {| 825 — 838).

1830.Ryder Scott has proven to be a partisan instrument of Claimants, rather than
independent experts. First, they were fully complicit in Claimants’ procedural
ambush at the Hearing on Quantum, where Claimants introduced a wholly new
“Interoil Reef” case based on 3D seismic data introduced in Ryder Scott’s direct
testimony. Ryder Scott failed to put this data on the record for one and a half years

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 401 of 415

1831.

1832.

1833.

Page 400 of 414

and the late introduction of this data hindered any meaningful cross examination of
Ryder Scott. Ryder Scott was fully complicit in that they deliberately concealed
their change in the GCOS estimate while the experts were preparing their joint
issue list. They signed off on the statement that there was “general agreement” on
the GCOS for the Contract 302 Area. Then, at the Hearing, they revealed that they
had 3D data and then departed from their “general agreement” on the GCOS. This
is not the behavior of an independent part-appointed expert, but rather proves that
Ryder Scott was willing to engage in partisan maneuvers and not to act with the
aim of assisting the Tribunal in finding the truth. Second, Ryder Scott
demonstrated their willingness to uncritically adopt Claimants’ findings as their
own. At the hearing, they presented the findings in the “Project Munaibay 3D”
presentation, prepared by Claimants, as their own findings. This was confirmed by
Mr. Nowicki’s testimony about drilling depths under cross-examination on 2 May
2013. It was apparent that Ryder Scott had not expected that there would be
another expert report concerning the 3D interpretation or that they would be subject
to cross-examination on that matter. (RPHB 2 [[433 — 442).

Mr. Nowicki of Ryder Scott was forced to admit to making further incorrect
statements. While he stated in his CV that he had “provided expert witness
testimony for various arbitration hearings”, he admitted that the present arbitration
was the first in which he gave testimony. He tried to mislead the Tribunal that the
3D structure was merely an update of the earlier 2D interpretation and not a
complete disproval of the 2D structure. Ryder Scott also ignored issues that would
hurt his clients’ position, such as the H2S issue and the faulting in the crest of the
“Interoil Reef.” His statements about the closure of the reef “in my mind, I know
that there has to be more to that reef. It doesn’t just end where the data ends” is
contradicted by the documentation and is also telling. This proves his lack of
forthrightness and independence. (RPHB 2 {| 445 — 448).

Ryder Scott makes methodological errors including basing its Interoil Reef
estimates on gas columns that are world record beating size, without demonstrating
closure and does not take account of faulting. (RPHB 2 [ 449).

FTI’s analysis is severely flawed:

(a) FTI incorrectly mixed the nominal and the real terms approach. FTI had to
concede this severe and obvious methodological mistake and as a result,
had to correct their overall value estimate by a stunning USD 379 million.

(b) FTI ignored known and quantified risks in their Contract No. 302
valuation, thus concealing valuable information from the Tribunal and
violating good valuation practice. Deloitte GmbH have calculated that if
GCoS and ECoS had been applied by FTI, the value of Contract No. 302
would be reduced in the order of 90%. FTI’s “prospective valuation” is
nothing but an attempt to “anchor” a high value with the Tribunal and it is
not aimed at providing any useful expertise.

(c) FTI arbitrarily reduced its inflation rate assumptions from one report to
another, with the clear intention to inflate asset values.

(d) FTI added almost USD 50 million to Claimants’ claim by way of arbitrary
rounding.

FTI arbitrarily reduced its country risk premium, even though KPM’s and
TNG’s financial statements explicitly mentioned country risk. FTI thus
minimised their discount rate and overstated values.

 

FTI created a 63.8% overstatement of their estimated market value for the
Munaibay oil discovery through a series of severe calculation mistakes.

FTI applied the same discount rate for their “prospective valuation” of the
LPG Plant as for their other valuations. This is inconsistent as FTI applied
different taxes to the LPG Plant.

FTI admittedly assumed incorrect administration costs with regard to the
Contract 302 Development.

FTI underestimated the variable distribution costs for KPM, thus
overstating Borankol’s value by a further USD 3.3 million. The same
mistake occurred in the EMV calculation for Munaibay Oil and in the
“prospective valuation” of the Contract 302 Properties.

FTI based its gas price assumptions on an unsigned draft contract which
they interpreted against its wording. Thus, FTI applied prices that were
never agreed upon to Contract No. 302 gas volumes that very likely do not
exist.

FTI made serious mistakes in their comparable companies and comparable
transactions analysis, such as using transactions that closed prior to the
financial crisis without adjusting for the effects thereof.

FTI conducted an entirely unrecognised, illogical and empirically
disproved valuation method for its “Implied Market Value of Debt”
analysis. (RPHB 2 {{ 451; see also { 453 - 474).

1834. Throughout these proceedings, FTI has made corrections in the amount of USD
841 to its value estimates. (RPHB 2 {{{[ 463 — 464). This is small compared to the
USD 530 million in changes that Claimants have stated make the Deloitte GmbH
and the Deloitte TCF valuations “completely unreliable.” (RPHB 2 § 465).

1835.Deloitte and GCA have provided solid work that remains intact and reliable and
should be used by this Tribunal for the purposes of damage calculation. Claimants’
and their experts’ criticism completely ignore the explanations given and
documents provided by GCA and Deloitte GmbH. Ryder Scott criticized GCA’s
reports, stating that they “saw nothing in the GCA reports that led them to believe
that GCA did independent geological, petrophysical or seismic analysis” This
criticism is undermined by GCA’s provision of GCOS sheets, Crystal Ball Sheets,
and other supporting documentation. Furthermore, there are no “wild swings” in
the GCA reports. One need only to look at the appendices to the GCA reports to
see that the amendments to the forecasts were minor, excepting the Munaibay Oil
estimate. All changes were explained. GCA provides detailed cost estimates
(which FTI hid from the Tribunal). Their approach in independently auditing the
available data was sufficient for estimating a FMV. (RPHB 2 {{ 443 — 444; 475 —
484).

 

408.3 | 79.2 | 329.1 | | 329.1 |

1836. Deloitte GmbH’s work was of far better quality and was more reliable than FTI’s.
FTI’s criticisms were baseless and could often have been avoided if FTI had not
ignored explanations given by Deloitte GmbH. (RPHB 2 {| 486 — 488).

1837.Regarding the differences between Deloitte GmbH and Deloitte TCF valuations,
Deloitte GmbH has explained why they applied different gas pricing assumptions
than did Deloitte TCF. As explained, the reason that Deloitte GmbH had not
provided a scrap value was because they had not received the working files from
Deloitte TCF. Claimants’ criticisms regarding the valuation of Munaibay Oil are
completely hypocritical. Respondent refuses any allegation of bad faith in
submitting the Deloitte TCF valuation. (RPHB 2 {| 489 — 493).

3. The Tribunal

1838.The Tribunal has taken note of the submissions by the Parties on their different
views regarding the professional methods and credibility of the experts who have
submitted reports and testified in the hearings of this case.

1839. However, the Tribunal’s considerations in the Award above rely, for the valuation
of the damages due, on factual and legal grounds that are mostly independent from
the conclusions of the Parties’ experts. In those few instances where the Tribunal
has relied on information or evaluation provided by the Parties’ experts, the
Tribunal has no hesitation to do so and such reliance is not impacted by the general
doubts the Parties have expressed regarding the professional methods and
credibility of the experts. Therefore, while the Tribunal understands why the
Parties have raised concerns regarding the experts, the Tribunal need not enter into
an examination of these issues for its decisions on the claims raised.

An award of interest is appropriate to fully compensate Claimants for the injury
caused by Kazakhstan. Claimants request that the Tribunal award pre-award and
post-award interest, compounded annually, to the value of each of the separate
elements of Claimants’ damages claim from 14 October 2008 to the date that
Respondent pays the Award in full. Awarding compound interest in investment
treaty cases is the standard practice, since that is the norm in commercial financing
transactions, making such necessary to fully compensate Claimants for the loss of
opportunity to invest the funds. The rate that the Tribunal selects should accord
with the general principle of “full reparation” for the injuries inflicted by
Kazakhstan, as noted in the LG&E v. Argentina and the Funnekotter v. Zimbabwe
decisions. The rate elected should be appropriate to compensate Claimants for the
full period of time that they have been deprived of the value of their investments.
(C-III ql 80 - 81, partially quoted; CPHB 1 {[ 650, CPHB 2 {{ 390).

Claimants suggest applying, at minimum, a rate akin to Kazakhstan’s sovereign
debt or borrowing rate to the compensation owed. This would reflect the fact that,
in effect, Respondent’s taking has forced Claimants to loan Respondent the amount
of compensation that Respondent would have paid. At maximum, the rate should
be the cost for commercial loans for investments in the Kazakh market during the
relevant time period (i.e., 10.5%, as exemplified in the rate for the Tristan notes
during the relevant period). Setting such a range is a reasonable application of the
Chorz6w is also consistent with the approaches of other arbitral tribunals, including
Funnekotter, Wena Hotels, and Impregilo S.p.A. (C-II {| 82, 86, 87).

Respondent has conceded that interest may be appropriate and suggested the rate of
6%, based on US Treasury Bills. This approach is inappropriate because it does
not reflect the rate that Claimants would have earned by investing the amount due.
Claimants are not in the business of investing in US Treasury bills and instead
invest in areas of the world, like Iraq and Southern Sudan, which have the potential
for enormous returns. The interest should be tailored toward what an investor like
Claimants could have earned by investing the funds. In Sylvania v. Iran, the
Tribunal observed that it could be appropriate to derive an interest rate that would
have been common in the investor’s own country. Thus, looking to the U.S.
Treasury Bill rate is inappropriate, and the rate from a commercial bank in
Moldova is more appropriate. While there is a currency component to commercial
interest rates, that is not a reason to apply the US Treasury Bill rate. Moldovan
commercial banks accept USD, and can apply interest to those deposits, following
the “investment approach.” (CPHB 1 § 655 — 657; CPHB 2 {{ 394).

Claimants would have maintained the debt and would have paid it off, but for
Kazakhstan’s conduct. Claimants also incurred debt that they would not have
otherwise incurred, absent Kazakhstan’s actions. The interest on the Laren loan
was 35% until it was paid off in 2011. The Tristan note interest rate is 10.5%.
10.5%, thus, conservatively reflects Claimants’ actual borrowing costs. To
compensate Claimants’ injury, the Tribunal should award interest at the rate of
10.5% on the entire award. Further, if the Tribunal does not award interest at least
the 10.5% Tristan note rate, then it should include as a component of the award the
interest that has accrued on those notes since 14 October 2008. (C-III {J 88 — 90;
CPHB 1 {{{[ 650 — 654; CPHB 2 {ff 391 — 393).

2. Arguments by Respondent

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 405 of 415
Page 404 of 414

1844. Respondent refutes Claimants’ range of interest rates arguments, stating that these
represent a contradiction to Claimants’ reasoning for an award of interest and are
contrary to arbitral practice. (R-II {{[ 476 — 478).

1845.Claimants have provided no evidence that the Tristan note rate would be an
example of typical interest for a commercial loan in Kazakhstan at the time, which
Respondent denies. Second, neither the commercial loan rate nor the sovereign
debt rate plays any role in the determination of interest rates for an award. (R-II
4 479 — 480).

1846. Respondent disagrees with Claimants’ contentions that the 10.5% interest rate on
the Tristan notes is the borrowing cost attributable to Respondent’s conduct.
Claimants are not liable for any of the noteholder debt and, to the extent that they
are based on the Sharing Agreement, the Republic cannot be liable for that
unilateral action. There is, therefore, nothing that could justify the 10.5% interest
rate. In addition, the interest rate owed pursuant to the Sharing Agreement is the
rate that is set by the Tribunal in a potential Award. Thus, at least as of 1 January
2012, 10.5% is not a reflection of Claimants’ borrowing costs — the Tribunal is free
to determine those costs, freely. (RPHB 1 {{{ 1010 — 1013).

1847.The Parties agree that the claim for interest arises from the principle of “full
compensation.” On this premise, the interest calculation must be based on what
Claimants could have earned by investing the amounts due under the Award — what
the Respondent did or could have done with the money in the meantime is
irrelevant. (R-II {{{[ 484 — 486). Applying the principles established in Siemens v.
Argentina, LG&E v. Argentina, Chevron v. Equator, and CSOB v. Slovak Republic,
Respondent states as follows:

(a) Claimants have never stated that they wanted and less even that they would
have been able to give out to anyone a loan at a rate typical “for
commercial loans for investments in the Kazakh market during the relevant
time period”. Claimants are not a bank operating in Kazakhstan. They do
not need to be “fully compensated” with regard to the interest a bank in
Kazakhstan could have achieved with a commercial loan.

(b) Likewise, there is no reason to assume that Claimants would have invested
any sum under a potential damages award into Kazakh state bonds. Given
what Claimants themselves claim to have been their experience with the
Kazakh government, this seems in fact very unlikely. (R-II {J 481 — 483,
partially quoted).

1848. Interest rates for typical conservative and risk-adverse investments should be
applied. This is confirmed by arbitral practice and is in line with the purpose of
“full compensation.” The use of risky investments as the baseline for a calculation
is particularly inappropriate and would force the Tribunal to decrease the return
rates of that investment with view to the increased risks. (R-II {{[ 487 — 489).

1849. Respondent submits that the low-risk re-investment rate that the Tribunal should
use for guidance is the rate for 6 month US Treasury Bills. Since one of the most
important factors in determining the interest rate for a debt is the currency of that
debt, the rate of the national bank supervising that currency is relevant. Awarding
based on typical USD interest rates for a risk-adverse investment would be in line

with other arbitral decisions whose only contact with the USA was that damages
were awarded in USD. Further, US Treasury Bills do not yield compound interest.
But, using the 6 months rate, it would be appropriate to compound interest semi-
annually. The Republic clarified that it has never generally accepted the
appropriateness of compound interest. Alternatively, an interbank offering rate
based on various large banks would be an appropriate benchmark. The Tribunal
should consider averages from multiple institutions or from countries and financial
institutions with high credit standing, and should also consider the duration to
maturity of the financial instrument. Using these factors, either the 6 month US
Treasury Bill rate or the interbank offering rate (i.e. Libor, 6 months) would be
appropriate. (R-III {| 490 — 494; RPHB 2 {J 1021 — 1024).

Claimants’ use of the interest rate offered by a specific Moldovan commercial
bank, “Victoriabank” is not appropriate, as demonstrated by Deloitte. First, the
interest rate offered by one specific commercial bank depends on the credit
standing of that bank. Second, the circumstances of that bank have nothing to do
with the situation of the present case. Third, FTI’s alleged investment approach (A
Moldovan Company to hold its money at one single Moldovan Bank) is doubtful,
since prudent investors spread their assets. (RPHB 2 {{{ 1019 — 1020).

No interest of any kind can be awarded for Claimants’ loss of opportunity claim
with respect to the Contract 302 properties. This follows from the principle that
there may not be double compensation. (R-II {| 495 — 497). Respondent’s
argument is best taken from its own words:

497. The awarding of damages for loss of opportunity — equal to the awarding
of damages for lost profits — is based on the presumption that capital had
been invested and that this investment would have created future profits.
However, capital invested in a way to create future profits cannot create
an additional amount of interest at the same time. Or in other words: the
future profits claimed are already the “interest” on the investment.
Additional interest is not possible have rejected the application of a
commercial or a sovereign debt rate. (R-III J 497).

3. The Tribunal

The Parties agree that, on damages awarded, interest is due. The Tribunal agrees as
well.

As the Tribunal has found above that the correct date for the valuation of damages
is 30 April 2009, this is also the date from which interest shall be calculated.

Regarding the rate of interest, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that according
to arbitral practice in comparable cases, the rate of a conservative investment
should be used. As Respondent rightly has pointed out (R-II 493) as the damages
will be awarded in US-Dollars, as confirmed by previous arbitral practice, the
Tribunal considers that the rates of 6 months US treasury bills over the relevant
period are the appropriate rate.

Regarding the question whether compound interest is due, Respondent’s comments
are not quite consistent. While, in its last submission (RPHB 2 { 1024),
Respondent denies that any compound interest should be awarded, the Tribunal

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 407 of 415
Page 406 of 414

rather agrees with Respondent’s comment in its Rejoinder (R-III { 494) that
Claimants could be expected to reinvest their interest gains every 6 months and
that, therefore, interest has to be compounded semi-annually.

L.XIII. Summary of Tribunal’s Conclusions Regarding
Quantum

1856.Based on the foregoing and as explained above, the Tribunal has accepted the
following quantum of damages to be paid from Respondent to Claimants. First, the
Tribunal has found in Claimants’ favor for the following amounts:

Section Title Amounts
LIV. Quantum Related to Borankol and Tolkyn Fields | USD 277,800,000.00
(Combined Asset Value)
LV. Quantum Related to Contract 302 Properties USD = 31,330,000.00
(Claimants’ Out of Pocket Investment Expenses)
L.VI. Quantum Related to the LPG Plant USD 199,000,000.00
SUBTOTAL USD 508,130,000.00
1857.The Tribunal has also found that certain debts need to be deducted from this
amount:
Section Title Amounts
LAI. Treatment of Debt
Reachcom Facility Agreement USD = 335,624.00
Limozen Facility Agreement USD 10,049,442.00

Reachcom Receivables Purchase Agreement USD 59,853.00

SUBTOTAL USD 10,444,899.00

1858.Since the only evidence that the Parties have provided regarding these debt
amounts is the FTI Consulting Second Expert Report (28 May 2012), that is what
the Tribunal uses to define the values of these debts.

1859. Subtracting the subtotal of debts (USD 10,444,899.00) from the subtotal of
compensation due (USD 508,130,000.00), the Tribunal concludes that the net
amount to be paid by Respondent to Claimants amounts to USD 497,685,101.00.

1860. This net amount is to be paid from Respondent to Claimants with interest, defined
as the rate of 6 months US Treasury Bills from 30 April 2009 to the date of

payment, compounded semi-annually.

1861.In addition to these amounts, the Tribunal decides on the arbitration costs, below.

M. Arbitration Costs
MLI. Arguments by Claimants

1862.Claimants request that the Tribunal award them all costs and expenses associated
with this arbitration, including attorneys’ fees and expenses, experts’ fees and
expenses, and fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the SCC, pursuant to Art. 44
of the SCC Arbitration Rules. Article 44 embodies the “/oser pays” rule, and, for
the reasons already set out above, Claimants should prevail and Respondent should
pay in this arbitration. (C-III {[ 98; C Costs {{[ 2 — 3; C Costs Reply ff] 2 — 3).
Claimants request that the Tribunal award Claimants the entirety of their costs in
this arbitration, USD 17,950,992.87, plus compound interest on the costs award at
a reasonable rate until Respondent pays in full. Claimants further request that the
Tribunal deny Respondent’s request for costs. (C Costs {| 30; C Costs Reply {fj 18
— 19).

1863.The severity of Respondent’s misconduct in the events leading to this arbitration
also weighs in favor of the Tribunal awarding Claimants the full costs incurred in
pursuing an international legal remedy for the injuries suffered. (C Costs {| 4 — 7;
C Costs Reply {{ 3).

1864. Respondent’s gross procedural misconduct greatly increased Claimants’ legal fees
and expenses and added nearly one year to the procedural calendar. Respondent’s
violation of PO-2 forced Claimants to prepare the bulk of their Reply submission
without the aid of those documents. The late submission of 30,000 pages of
materials resulted in significant delay and the quasi-bifurcation of the proceeding.
Respondent’s withholding of the four critical diligence and valuation reports for
thirteen months, in violation of PO-2 and PO-3, exacerbated Claimants’ expenses.
Respondent held Claimants to prove and respond to positions that Respondent
knew to be contradicted by crucial, contemporaneous evidence. In addition,
Respondent increased costs by submitting lengthy, confusing, and contradictory
written pleadings. Respondent’s case materially changed throughout its
submissions, requiring Claimants to submit new evidence to disprove it. Absent the
untimely submission of the false contention regarding the Interoil Reef, the May
2013 Hearing would not have needed to include expert testimony on that subject.
Respondent’s misconduct is similar to and indeed worse than the respondent’s
misconduct in ADC v. Hungary, where the tribunal found an award of Claimants’
legal expenses was justified. Here, Claimants should not be forced to bear the
costs of Respondent’s poor planning and its unwillingness/inability to follow the
Tribunal’s instructions. (C Costs §] 8 — 21; C Costs Reply ff 4 — 5).

1865.Claimants incurred USD 17,950,992.87 in total costs, fees, and expenses in this
arbitration. These costs were reasonable in light of the complexity of the case
(involving 10 pleadings, 97 witness statements and expert reports, and over 1100
exhibits), its duration, and the harm that Respondent caused to Claimants’
investments. The legal fees are in line with market rates and the fees of the experts
are tailored to the scope and complexity of the issues addressed. The total costs
comprise less than 2% of the quantum claimed. The table, found at C Costs {{ 23,
summarizes Claimants’ costs. (C Costs {{[ 22 — 27).

1866.Claimants note that the Parties have submitted very similar cost claims, with
Claimants claiming USD 17,950,993 and Respondent claiming USD 17,625,116.
It should be noted, however, that Claimants have already paid USD 1,425,449 of
the SCC’s and the Tribunal’s advances, and Respondent has only paid USD
42,411. (C Costs Reply 14, stating USD 42,411 in reference to the advances. This
is likely a typo, since the advance that Respondent states that it paid amounted to
USD 38,991.00 and was reported on the line above the USD 42,411 amount, which
was for the Hearing Center). It is clear, therefore, that if the Parties had shared the

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 410 of 415
Page 409 of 414

costs equally as they were supposed to, Claimants’ overall costs claim would be
approximately USD | million less than Respondent’s. Each Party would have paid
USD 733,930 in SCC advances, thereby reducing Claimants’ claim to USD
17,259,474 and increasing Respondent’s claim to USD 18,316,635. This shows
not only the reasonableness of Claimants’ claim, but also underscores that a
significant portion of the costs claimed are directly attributable to Respondent’s
misconduct. (C Costs {{[ 28 — 29; C Costs Reply {{ 14).

1867.Claimants, contrary to Respondent’s argument, have not changed their relief
sought. The Statement of Claim was clear that the claim for the Contract 302
properties was one for loss of opportunity. There is authority that the Tribunal may
exercise its discretion to fix the amount of damages. This has had no effect on the
costs of the proceeding. Second, there was no “surprise” introduction of 3D
Seismic Data, nor did the production increase the costs of this proceeding.
Claimants properly submitted the 3D seismic in order to rebut Respondent’s
argument made in December 2012 that Claimants had no intention to explore the
Interoil Reef. There was no reason to submit the 3D seismic prior to that.
Fundamentally, however, this introduction did not increase Respondent’s costs —
effort to review and analyse the data would have been expended even if the data
had been submitted earlier. Importantly, the submission of the 3D seismic had
nothing to do with the necessity of the May 2013 Hearing, which occurred because
the Parties jointly requested an opportunity for oral closing arguments, in January
2013. The additional costs by addressing the 3D seismic at that hearing were
incremental, at best. (C Costs Reply {[{[ 6 — 9).

1868. Respondent’s additional allegations of misconduct are intended only to distract the
Tribunal. With regard to the new documents submitted on 20 September 2012 and
the Sharing Agreement, those were submitted with the Tribunal’s permission. (C
Costs Reply {{f[ 10 — 11).

1869. While Respondent now argues that it would have submitted the KMG EP Due
Diligence documents sooner, there is no evidence that KMG considered the
documents confidential. In any event, that confidentiality had been waived when it
disclosed those to Respondent’s counsel and experts. Regarding the so-called
“disappearance” of Laura Hardin, that is a non-issue — Ms. Hardin left the
employment of FTI in June 2012. The circumstances of her departure were beyond
Claimants’ knowledge or control. It was immaterial because her partner, Howard
Rosen, who was involved in the preparation of all of the damages reports, appeared
and gave testimony. In any event, this stands in juxtaposition to Respondent’s
misconduct regarding the Deloitte TCF report. (C Costs Reply {ff 12 — 13).

1870.Some of the costs claimed by Respondent, including the USD 600,000 for the
Deloitte TCF Report, and USD 270,000 for Prof. Olcott, and the USD 60,000 for
Neftegazkonsult are related to Respondent’s procedural misconduct and are
particularly objectionable. Respondent’s costs for its quantum and geology
experts, Deloitte GmbH and GCA, substantially exceed Claimants’ cost
submissions for FTI and Ryder Scott, and are particularly excessive when
compared to the quality of those reports. (C Costs Reply {| 15 — 16).

Claimants have forced Respondent to spend three years defending baseless
allegations in four hearings, numerous written submissions, and further
correspondence. They have blown this case out of proportion and submitted new
and contradictory expert opinions and last minute evidence before each hearing.
That they changed their claim from their USD 1.4 billion and then put the valuation
“at the discretion of the Tribunal” is an additional example of how they blew up
their claim. Their initial and deliberate ignorance of the complexity of this case
was the cornerstone for delay in these proceedings. (R Costs {fff 1 — 4; R Costs
Reply {if 4 — 5).

Claimants’ procedural conduct was far from exemplary. Although the first two
FTI reports were co-authored by Laura Hardin, Claimants refused to offer her for
cross examination and likely never intended to. (RPHB 2 {[f[ 1041 — 1050).
Claimants’ procedural misconduct also caused Respondent to incur significant loss,
giving the Respondent the right to demand reimbursement of all costs incurred as a
result. In particular, their abuse related to the Munaibay 3D seismic rendered much
of Respondent’s preparation obsolete and subsequently caused additional costs in
excess of USD 500,000. Respondent’s experts, GCA, were forced to study these
by surprise in less than 2 months, rather than 2.5 years. Counsel was forced to
recruit and coordinate with new experts and GCA’s experts had to come to a
second hearing. Claimants attempt to make Respondent responsible for the belated
introduction of 3D seismic data, but this was Claimants’ doing. Whether
intentional or not, the delayed introduction of the 3D seismic data led to significant
additional costs and delay, for which Claimants are responsible. (R Costs {{[ 5 —
11; R Costs Reply 4 6 — 7).

Claimants’ other procedural misconduct, including the disruptive submission of
new documents before hearings and outside of the procedural timetable, their ex-
post attempt to justify its position in a “debt gross-up”, the Request to Compel
Production of 2 January 2013, and their baseless objections to expert testimony
also led to further additional costs and created mounting time pressure for
Respondent. (R Costs { 12; RPHB 2 {| 1041 et seq.).

Claimants’ arguments that Respondent should pay their costs, in particular every
single accusation of procedural misconduct, are without merit. In addition,
Claimants’ argument that the Respondent espoused positions that it knew to be
untrue is particularly far-fetched. The KMG EP Due Diligence documents support
Respondent’s position. There are sections in that report where the opinions
expressed are different from the Respondent’s and its experts’ views, but that is
merely because the due diligence reports are exactly what they purport to be: the

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 413 of 415
Page 412 of 414

professional opinion of the authors of those reports. The Respondent was
previously barred from submitted the KMG EP Due Diligence documents by KMG
EP’s refusal to disclose the documents. (R Costs {J 13 — 18; R Costs Reply {| 8 —
10).

1877.Claimants’ expert, FTI, made numerous baseless allegations, thereby forcing
Deloitte to rebut them, since a diligent expert report must address the other side’s
arguments, no matter how far-fetched. If Claimants consider that their costs and
expenses are appropriate, they cannot deny that this holds true for the Respondent’s
costs and expenses. (R Costs Reply { 11).

M.II. The Tribunal

1878.The relevant provisions regarding the costs of arbitration are provided in Art. 43
and 44 SCC Rules.

1879. Pursuant to Art. 43.2, by its letter of 12 December 2013, the SCC Board has
determined the costs of this arbitration, and pursuant to Art. 43.4, these are
included in this Award as follows:

Karl-Heinz Bécksticucl

Fee EUR 400 000
Per diem EUR & 500
Expenses EUR 11 73039
‘Sceretary EUR 60 672,74
David R. Haigh, QC

Fee EUR 240 000
Per diem EUR 12 500
Expenses EUR 20 857,46]
Sergei Lebedev

Fee EUR 240 000
Per diem EUR 12 500
Expenses EUR 271024
Stockholm Chamber of Commerce:

Administrative fee EUR 60.000

1880. According to Art. 43.5, “the Arbitral Tribunal shall, at the request of a party,
apportion the Costs of the Arbitration between the parties, having regard to the
outcome of the case and other relevant circumstances.” Further, regarding the costs
incurred by a party, Art. 44 provides the Tribunal a similar discretion at the request
of a party, to order one party to pay any reasonable costs incurred by another party,
including the costs of legal representation, again “having regard to the outcome of
the case and other relevant circumstances.”

1881.Such requests for the application of both provisions have been made by the Parties
in this case and the Tribunal, therefore, has to decide on them.

1882. The Tribunal is aware of a certain practice in investment treaty arbitration that each
party bears its own costs and that the parties divide tribunal costs equally. That

Case 1:14-cv-00175-ABJ Document 2-1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 414 of 415
Page 413 of 414

practice is not binding on this Tribunal, which prefers the more recent practice in
investment arbitration of applying the general principle of “costs follow the event.”
That approach is the more compelling one in the present case which is governed by
the SCC Rules that expressly contemplate the rule of “costs follow the event” in
Art. 43.5 and 44 by their emphasis on “the outcome of the case.” This conclusion is
supported by both sides’ arguments that the unsuccessful side in this arbitration
should have to bear the full amount of tribunal costs as well as the other side’s
costs of legal representation.

1883.Regarding the present case, the Tribunal takes into account that Claimants
requested a total relief of more than USD 1 billion plus what they call a
discretionary portion in the range of USD 1.5 billion, of which this Award only
grants an amount in the range of USD 0.5 billion, ic. some 20%. On the other
hand, Claimants prevail on jurisdiction, liability, causation, and part of quantum,
all of which were the major objects of the dispute and made up by far the greatest
part of the work of the Parties and of the Tribunal in this procedure.

1884. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent shall pay to Claimants 50% of
Claimants’ costs of legal representation. For the same reasons, the Tribunal
concludes that, of the arbitration costs for the SCC and the Tribunal as quoted
above, Respondent has to bear %4 and Claimants 14.

1885.As both sides come out with very similar total costs of their legal representation,
the Tribunal accepts the amounts of costs claimed by both sides as reasonable.
Both Parties have included in their cost claims the deposits they paid to the SCC
for arbitration costs. According to Claimants, they have paid total deposits of USD
1,425,448.95 to the SCC. According to Respondent, it has paid what it calls an
“SCC additional advance” of USD 38,991.00, though no other deposit payment is
mentioned. During the procedure, the SCC has informed the Tribunal by its letters
of 11 October 2010 and 20 June 2012 of some of the deposits paid by the
Claimants. The SCC did not inform the Tribunal of any deposit payments made by
Respondent. With its decision of 12 December 2013, the SCC did not inform the
Tribunal of the total deposits paid by the Parties, but pointed out that it will
determine the exact amounts due by each Party in its settlement of accounts with
the Parties. The SCC costs decision was denominated in Euro, while the Parties
have submitted their costs claims in USD. The total arbitration costs set by the
SCC amount to EUR 1,069,470.98, of which %4 are to be borne by Respondent,
according to the Tribunal’s above ruling. This amounts to EUR 802,103.24. The
Tribunal, therefore, concludes that Respondent shall pay to Claimants /% of
Claimants’ full cost claim of USD 17,950,992.87, in an amount of USD
8,975,496.40. Obviously, this amount comprises the above awarded 50% of
Claimants’ costs of legal representation and the USD 712,724.47 portion of the
EUR 802,103.24 SCC costs which Respondent shall bear. The remaining
accounting of the deposits will have to be done between the SCC and the Parties.

(The Decisions of the Tribunal are placed on a separate page of this Award

hereafter.)

1. The Respondent has violated its obligations under the Energy Charter
Treaty with respect to the Claimants’ investments.

2, Subtracting the subtotal of debts (USD 10,444,899.00) from the

497,685,101.00.

3. This net amount is to be paid from Respondent to Claimants with
interest, defined as the rate of 6 months US Treasury Bills from 30
April 2009 to the date of payment, compounded semi-annually.

4, Regarding the costs of arbitration, the Tribunal decides:
4.1.0F the costs of arbitration as determined by the Arbitration

Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (SCC),

Respondent shall bear % and Claimants 4. These arbitration costs
will be drawn from the advances paid by the Parties to the SCC.

 

4.2.Further, Respondent shall pay to Claimants 50% of
Claimants’ costs of legal representation, i.c. an amount of
USD 8,975,496.40.

5. All other claims are dismissed.
