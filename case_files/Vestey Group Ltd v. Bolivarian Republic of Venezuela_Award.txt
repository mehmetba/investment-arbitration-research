INTRODUCTION

THE DISPUTE

The present dispute arises out of Venezuela's introduction of measures affecting the
Claimant's purported ownership over a cattle farming business in Venezuela. More
specifically, the claims relate to Venezuela's conduct under a legal regime governing
agricultural estates, primarily contained in the law of 13 November 2001 entitled
Decreto 1546 con fuerza de ley de tierras y desarrollo agrario (the "2001 Land Law")
and its successive laws and amendments (together referred to as the "Land Law").

The Claimant contends that that conduct resulted in the unlawful expropriation of the
Claimant's cattle farming business in Venezuela and constituted multiple breaches of
the 1995 Agreement of Promotion and Protection of Investments between the
government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
government of the Republic of Venezuela (the "BIT"). The Claimant seeks damages
for harm caused by these alleged breaches.

THE PARTIES

1. The Claimant
The Claimant, Vestey Group Limited is a private limited company incorporated under
the laws of England and Wales under company number 4494323 and having its head

offices at St. John's Lane, London EC1M 4AF, United Kingdom (the "Claimant" or
"Vestey").

The Claimant is represented in this arbitration by Messrs. Nigel Blackaby, Sylvia
Noury, Lluis Paradell, Jean-Paul Dechamps, Cristian Nitsch, Katrina Woolcock, Lucia
Mazzuca of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, and by Julio Pinto and Pedro
Rangel of Travieso Evans Arria Rengel & Paz.

2. The Respondent
The Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the “Respondent” or the

“Republic’).

Since 20 August 2014, the Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Messrs.
Osvaldo Guglielmino, Diego Brian Gosis, Manuel Galindo, Debora Espinoza, David

Burguillos, Facundo Perez Aznar, Pablo Parrilla and Guillermo Moro of Guglielmino
& Asociados S.A. Prior to 20 August 2014, the Respondent was represented by
Messrs. Thomas B. Wilner, Fernando Mantilla-Serrano and Christopher M. Rayan of
Shearman & Sterling LLP.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 21 October 2005 the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(‘ICSID” or the “Centre”) received a Request for Arbitration filed by the Claimant
against the Respondent (the “Request” or “RfA”) dated 20 October 2005. The Request
concerned the alleged expropriation and other violations of the obligations under the
BIT in relation with Claimant's cattle farming business in Venezuela.

In the Request, the Claimant invoked Venezuela’s consent to dispute settlement
through ICSID arbitration provided in the BIT. The Claimant also relied on Venezuelan
law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments (Decreto con Rango y Fuerza de
Ley de Promocién y Proteccién de Inversiones) dated 22 October 1999 (the
“Venezuelan Investment Law’).

On 28 October 2005, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request pursuant to
Rule 5 of the ICSID Institution Rules and transmitted a copy to Venezuela and to the
Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, D.C.

The Request, as supplemented by the Claimant's letter of 16 December 2005, was
registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on 14 March 2006 pursuant to Article
36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On the same day, the Secretary-General, in
accordance with Rule 7(c) of the Centre’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of
Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings, notified the Parties of the registration and
invited them to proceed to constitute the Arbitral Tribunal.

On 12 May 2006, the Claimant requested the Centre to suspend the arbitral
proceedings for a period of six months. On that same date, the proceedings were
suspended until 19 September 2006. The suspension was extended at the Claimant's
request on several occasions. The last suspension expired on 19 December 2011.

By letter of 20 December 2011, the Claimant notified Venezuela that the proceedings
were resumed as of that date. By that same letter, the Claimant made a proposal to
Venezuela as to the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment.

On 7 February 2012, the Parties agreed to again stay the proceedings until
21 February 2012.

In letter of 6 March 2012, the Claimant invoked the procedure for the constitution of
the Arbitral Tribunal established in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, i.e. one
arbitrator appointed by each party, and the third arbitrator, who would serve as
President of the tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties. On 8 March
2012, Venezuela made a proposal about the number of arbitrators and the method of
their appointment, which departed from the procedure under Article 37(2)(b) of the
ICSID Convention.

Following various exchanges between the Parties, the Claimant informed the Centre
on 15 March 2012 that the Parties had reached an agreement on the method of
constitution of the Tribunal. By this same communication, the Claimant appointed
Prof. Horacio Grigera Na6n, a national of Argentina, as arbitrator. Prof. Grigera Naon
accepted his appointment on 20 March 2012. By letter of 18 April 2012, Venezuela
appointed Prof. Pierre-Marie Dupuy, a national of France, as arbitrator. Prof. Dupuy
accepted his appointment on 24 April 2012 (on 4 June 2012, he submitted an
addendum to his declaration of acceptance).

Pursuant to the Parties’ agreement, the co-arbitrators were requested to jointly
propose a list of candidates to be considered by the Parties for the position of
President of the Tribunal.

By email of 29 June 2012, the co-arbitrators informed the Center that the Parties had
jointly selected Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, as President of the Tribunal, from
the list of candidates that they had proposed. Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of
Switzerland, accepted her appointment as President of the Tribunal on 5 July 2012.

By letter of 6 July 2012, the Centre informed the Parties that all of the arbitrators had
accepted their appointments and that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the
Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings to have begun
on that date. Ms. Alicia Martin Blanco, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated by the
Secretary-General of ICSID to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.

The first session of the Tribunal was held by teleconference on 29 August 2012.
Following the Parties’ agreement that a meeting was not necessary, the first session
was held among the Tribunal Members.

During the first session, the Tribunal addressed the items on the draft procedural order
as revised and agreed by the Parties, confirmed the Parties’ agreements and decided
on the points in dispute. On 30 August 2012, the Tribunal circulated Procedural Order
No. 1 containing the Parties’ agreements and the Tribunal’s decisions, including a
schedule of the proceedings.

The Claimant submitted its Memorial on the Merits (“CM”) and accompanying
materials on 15 January 2013.

On 1 March 2013, the Respondent submitted its Request for Bifurcation, pursuant to
which it requested the Tribunal to suspend the proceedings on the merits and to
determine the Tribunal’s jurisdiction as a preliminary matter.

The Claimant submitted its Observations on the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation
on 15 March 2013.

On 5 April 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, denying the Request for
Bifurcation.

The Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Objections to
Jurisdiction (“RCM”) and accompanying materials on 12 August 2013.

On 2 September 2013, following exchanges between the Parties, the Claimant
submitted its First Request for the Production of Documents. On 16 September 2013,
the Respondent submitted its Objections and Responses to the Claimant's First
Request for the Production of Documents. On 23 September 2013, the Claimant filed
a reply and, on 4 October 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3,
containing the Tribunal’s decision on Claimant's First Request for Document
Production.

The Claimant filed its Reply on the Merits and Response to the Respondent’s
Objection to Jurisdiction (“C-Reply”) and accompanying materials on 12 November
2013.

On 3 December 2013, following exchanges between the Parties, the Respondent
submitted its First Request for the Production of Documents. On 17 December 2013,
the Claimant submitted its Objections and Responses to the Respondent's First
Request for the Production of Documents. On 24 December 2013, the Respondent
filed its reply and, on 3 January 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4,

containing the Tribunal’s decision on Respondent's First Document Production
Request.

The Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits and its Reply on Jurisdiction and
accompanying materials on 12 February 2014.

By letter of 24 March 2014, the Claimant requested an order from the Tribunal
granting the Claimant six weeks to file a response to the additional submissions on
jurisdiction that the Respondent had filed together with its Rejoinder. By letter of 4
April 2014, the Respondent opposed this request. The Claimant also requested an
order from the Tribunal regarding the Respondent's alleged submission of privileged
documents and the allegedly untimely submission of documents by the Respondent.

On 17 April 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, in which it addressed
a number of objections and requests made by the Claimant in connection with the
Respondent’s Rejoinder and granted the Claimant's request regarding the filing of a
Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.

By letter of 2 May 2014, the Claimant made additional observations in relation to the
Respondent's alleged submission of privileged documents and untimely submission
of documents. The Respondent commented on 16 May 2014.

On 30 May 2014, the Claimant filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (“C-Rejoinder”) and
accompanying materials.

On 18 June 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 addressing the privilege
issue and the timeliness of the documents submitted by the Respondent. The
Claimant submitted an additional communication on these issues on 19 June 2014.

On 27 June 2014, the Respondent requested the postponement of the time limits in
Procedural Orders Nos. 5 and 6 by 60 days due to the changes in the legal team
representing Venezuela in this case. The Claimant confirmed that it had no objection
to this postponement by letter of 2 July 2014. By letter of 16 July 2014, the Tribunal
noted the Parties’ agreement.

On 20 August 2014, Venezuela appointed new counsel in this case.

On 14 October 2014, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 6 and the Parties’
agreement, the Respondent submitted a redacted version of its Reply on
Jurisdictional Objections and Rejoinder (“R-Rejoinder’).

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

In this section the Tribunal sets forth the main facts underlying the present dispute as
they arise from the record. When it considers that a fact is not established, the Tribunal
will so state, in particular, by noting that the fact is disputed or that it is alleged by one
Party. It will refer to additional facts when needed in the context of its analysis.

BRIEF OVERVIEW

Vestey began its operations in Venezuela in 1909 and by the end of the 20" century
it operated a cattle farming business extending over more than 290,000 hectares of
land with a herd exceeding 100,000 heads of livestock.

In 1999, Venezuela adopted a new constitution mandating a land reform and the
elimination of large idle estates ("/atifundios"). To implement the land reform,
Venezuela passed the 2001 Land Law on 13 November 2001. The 2001 Land Law
authorized the State to recover illegally occupied idle estates for public utility purposes
and social use.

Between 2001 and 2006, the Respondent served several recovery (“rescate”) notices
directed towards certain Farms which Vestey operated. In this context, Vestey agreed
to sell one of its Farms and to donate another one to the State (the "2006 Agreement").
After failed negotiations, the Respondent ordered in 2011 the recovery of all the
remaining Farms operated by Vestey and took control over Vestey's movable and
immovable property located on the Farms.

VESTEY'S CATTLE FARMING BUSINESS IN VENEZUELA

Vestey started its activities in Venezuela in 1909 by leasing a slaughterhouse and a
cold storage facility in Puerto Cabello for purchasing, processing and exporting beef".

See CM, 919.

51.

52.

In 1916, Lancashire General Investment Trust Limited,? a UK corporation and a
subsidiary of Vestey, established a Venezuelan branch, which it transformed much
later in 1987 into a Venezuelan corporation by the name of Agropecuaria Flora
"Agroflora" C. A. ("Agroflora").? Agroflora has been indirectly owned by the Claimant
through Vestey Holdings Limited and Vestey Farms Limited.*

Between 1916 and 1988, Vestey registered the acquisition of the following agricultural
land plots with the Venezuelan public registry of immovable property (the "Public
Registry"):

i. Hato Guataparo — State of Carabobo;
ii. Hato Matapalos — State of Apure;

iii. Hato Los Cocos — State of Apure;

iv. Hato Morichito — State of Apure;

v. Hato Los Viejitos — State of Apure;

vi. Hato La Bendicién Ramera — State of Apure;

vii.

Hato San Pablo Paefio — State of Apure;
viii. Hato Turagua — State of Apure;
ix. Hato Punta de Mata — State of Apure;

x. Hato Las Palmeras — State of Apure;

xi. Hato Cafafistolo — State of Apure;

xii.

Hato La Cueva — State of Guarico;

xiii. Hato El Charcote — State of Cojedes;

In 1923, Lancashire General Investment Trust Limited, a company incorporated in the United

Kingdom in 1911, was converted into the Lancashire General Investment Company Limited, while
maintaining its Venezuelan branch, Exh. C-9.

Limited, later Lancashire General Investment Company Limited.

xiv. Hato El Carmen — State of Falcén (each one a “Farm” and collectively the
“Farms").5

Over the years, Vestey improved the Farms by adding fences, developing pastures,
and building warehouses and accommodations. Its activities consisted essentially in
breeding, raising, fattening, slaughtering and selling cattle.

In its very early years, Vestey exported meat to Europe. Since 1919, however, the
beef which it produced in Venezuela was sold exclusively on the domestic market. In
addition to selling meat, Vestey also sold cattle to other farmers for further fattening
and slaughter or for genetic improvements®. To improve the genetic quality of its own
herd, Vestey imported purebred cattle and maintained a small genetic laboratory’.

As of 31 October 2011, when Venezuela ordered the recovery of the Farms, Vestey's
cattle farming business counted 114, 327 heads of livestock, including purebred and
commercial cattle, as well as buffalos and equine stock.® Vestey also owned 64
vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, pickups and trucks, 43 tractors and a light
airplane’. Vestey employed around 280 permanent and up to 170 temporary staff in
Venezuela. '°

THE LAND REFORM

In 1999, a year after President Chavez's election, Venezuela adopted a new
constitution. The Constitution was in line with the socialist objectives that inspired
Venezuelan politics at that time aimed at increasing agricultural productivity and
ensuring a secure food supply.’ The Constitution mandated a land reform, and in
particular, called for the adoption of measures to eliminate large idle estates '*.

In that context, Article 307 of the Constitution provides for the elimination of large idle
estates in the following terms:
“The predominance of large land estates is contrary to the interests of society.

Appropriate tax law provisions shall be enacted to tax fallow lands and establish the
necessary measures to transform them into productive economic units, likewise

recovering arable land. Farmers and other agricultural producers are entitled to own
land, in the cases and forms specified under the pertinent law.”'>
58. On 13 November 2001, in accordance with the powers vested in him, '4 the President

of Venezuela passed the 2001 Land Law. The 2001 Land Law created the National
Land Institute ("INTI"), an administrative organ within the structure of the Ministry of
Public Power of Agriculture and Lands (the "MOA")."5 It also established regional land
offices ("RLOs") as subdivisions of INTI. The 2001 Land Law reiterated the purpose
of eliminating /atifundios as contrary to justice.'® It further provided for the recovery
without compensation of state-owned agricultural land illegally occupied by private
persons.'”

59. About a year later, on 20 November 2002, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme
Court of Venezuela struck down certain provisions of the 2001 Land Law.'® In
particular, the Court declared Articles 89 and 90 unconstitutional. Article 89 mandated
the President of INTI to authorize a preventive intervention into idle or uncultivated
land, and Article 90 denied the right of compensation for improvements found on the
recovered land.

60. As a consequence, on 18 May 2005, the National Assembly of Venezuela (the
"National Assembly") amended the 2001 Land Law (the "2005 Land Law").'? Among
other matters, the 2005 Land Law reiterated the procedure for recovery without
compensation of illegally occupied state-owned land. Moreover, it restated that no
compensation was due for the improvements present on the land subject to
recovery.?°

61. On 29 July 2010, the National Assembly amended the Land Law once again (the
"2010 Land Law").?1 The 2010 Land Law maintained the procedure of recovery of

illegally occupied state-owned estates and additionally introduced the possibility for
INTI to recover lands over which no “perfect chain of title” could be established:
“Similarly, the National Land Institute can recover the lands the ownership over which
is attributed to individuals, if upon conducting the documentary analysis of the
sufficient titles required to the individual to whom the ownership is attributed, this latter
fails to demonstrate a perfect chain of titles and other alleged rights since the release

validly granted by Venezuelan Nation, until the time of due protocolization of the
acquisition by the individual who alleges the ownership.” 2

EVENTS BETWEEN 2000 AND 2006

The Claimant alleges that between 2000 and 2006 different measures affected its
Farms. It claims that the government failed to protect the Farms from invasions of
squatters. It also contends that Venezuela took confiscatory measures against
Vestey’s Farms under the legal regime of the Land Law. In the following paragraphs,
the Tribunal states the facts as they arise from the record to provide the reader with
a picture as complete as possible. This said, it notes that the Claimant requests no
relief in connection with events involving Hatos El Charcote, Guataparo and San
Pablo Paefio.#

1. Hato El Charcote*

In October 2000, around 50 persons invaded Hato El Charcote. By April 2001, similar
invasions resulted in the occupation of around 25% of Hato El Charcote.?5

In 2002, INTI started investigating Agroflora's title over Hato El Charcote®® and, by
December 2003, the squatters were occupying more than a half of the hato. The RLO
of the state of Cojedes noted in a technical report of June of that year that the
squatters had built 140 homes and a school and were cultivating 3 400 hectares of El
Charcote.?”

In the following year, on 9 December 2004, the Governor of the state of Cojedes,
Mr. Johnny Yanez issued a decree according to which certain land plots, including

In Spanish: "Asi mismo, el Instituto Nacional de Tierras podra rescatar las tierras aun en los casos
en que la propiedad sea atribuida a particulares, cuando, al efectuar el analisis documental de los
titulos suficientes que fueran requeridos a aquel que se atribuye el derecho de propiedad, éste no
lograre demostrar una perfecta secuencia y encadenamiento de las titularidades del dominio y
demas derechos alegados, desde el desprendimiento validamente otorgado por la Nacién
Venezolana, hasta el titulo debidamente protocolizado de adquisicién por parte de quien alega
propiedad." /d., Article 82.

Hato El Charcote, were declared idle or affected by an ownership defect.8 The decree
called for investigations and further measures of implementation of the 2001 Land
Law. It also authorized the intervention into El Charcote. The Claimant claims that,
shortly thereafter, during the three months from January to March of 2005, the
squatters set fire to the farm buildings and pastures in Hato El Charcote.

On 28 February 2005, the RLO of the state of Cojedes transmitted the file of Hato El
Charcote to INTI, with a determination that there was no chain of valid title transfers
for the estate and that the land was thus idle.*° That was followed by INTI's reports of
2 and 9 March 2005 which concluded that there was no valid title over Hato El
Charcote and that the farm was unproductive.*°

On 15 March 2005, INTI then issued a notice,*" by which it:
i. Declared Hato El Charcote idle and state property;
ii. Ordered interim measures for the protection of the environment;

iii. Gave the squatters present on the territory of Hato El Charcote the right to
remain ("derecho de permanencia’);

iv. Authorized the initiation of the process of recovery of Hato El Charcote.

A week later, on 22 March 2005, the Minister of Agriculture and Land, the Director of
INTI and the Governor together with other government officials and armed forces
entered Hato El Charcote and handed the derechos de permanencia to the squatters.

On 11 May 2005, Agroflora requested the annulment of INTI's resolution of 15 March
2005 before the Superior Agrarian Court. This request was still pending when Vestey
sold Hato El Charcote to INTI in 2006 (see {J 73-78 below).

2. Other Farms

In February 2005, the RLO of the state of Apure started an investigation with respect
to parts of Hato La Bendicién Ramera.* In that same year, similar investigations were

conducted with respect to other Farms, namely Hatos Guataparo, Turagua, Los
Viejitos, Cafafistolo, Punta de Mata and Los Cocos.*

71. On 4 April 2005, INTI issued a notice declaring Hato Los Cocos Morichito idle and
state property for lack of a valid title and insufficiency of agricultural activities.** Vestey
sought the annulment of this notice before the Superior Agrarian Court on 8 June
2005.%5

72. On 17 June 2005, INTI issued a similar notice declaring Hato San Pablo Paefio and
Hato La Bendicién Ramera idle and state property.*° The notices included provisional
measures for purposes of health and environmental protection. They also provided
for the grant of derechos de permanencia to persons applying for such rights.

73. On 6 September 2005, INTI notified Agroflora about the provisional measures. Two
days later, about 70 squatters accompanied by armed forces entered Hato La
Bendicién Ramera.*” Following the intervention of the Director of INTI, who had been
approached by Ms. dos Santos of Agroflora the squatters left the hato by November

2005.28
E. THE 2006 AGREEMENT
74. In October 2005 and then again in March of the following year, Ms. dos Santos met

with the Director of INTI to discuss the situation at the Farms.®° This led to the
conclusion of an agreement on 17 March 2006 between Vestey (including Vestey
Group Limited, Vestey Farms, Agroflora, Agronifia, and Haciendas Guataparo) and
INTI, according to which Vestey undertook to sell Hato El Charcote to INTI for 9 billion
bolivars (approximately USD 4 million) and to donate Hato San Pablo Paefio (the
"2006 Agreement"). Vestey also agreed to stay the ICSID proceedings which it had
initiated about half a year earlier. For its part, INTI agreed to revoke its resolutions of
2005 declaring certain Farms state property, including the two Farms subject to the
2006 Agreement as well as two others, namely Hatos Los Cocos and La Bendicién
Ramera. It did so in the following terms:

the productivity and sufficiency of title to each of the said farms through the certificate

The 2006 Agreement also contains the following language, the meaning of which is
disputed and discussed later:

"The recognition by INTI, through the certificate of the productive farm, in accordance
with the provisions of the [Land Law], of the condition of productivity and sufficient
title over the following farms: (i) Cafiafistolo; (ii) Turagua; (iii) Punta de Mata; (iv) Los

legal reports of the respective Regional Technical Office with respect to the
productivity of the said farms [...].

Two days before the conclusion of the 2006 Agreement, INTI had already revoked its
resolutions concerning Hato El Charcote and Hato San Pablo Paefio.*? On 2 April

2006, Vestey effected the sale of Hato El Charcote by a separate agreement*? and
executed a deed by which it donated San Pablo Paefio in favor of INTI.44

In April 2006, President Chavez visited Hato San Pablo Paefio to participate in the
official handover of the Farm to INTI. He made a public statement welcoming Vestey’s
donation of the Farm to the state and asserting that the Republic was not going to
take Vestey’s cattle without compensation:
“They have even gone as far as to donate the installations, that is to say, here there
are houses, fences, things called improvements; and we are going to buy the cattle
from them [...], and we are going to pay that to the Compaiiia Inglesa [Vestey], it is
theirs, how could we steal from them? We would be thieves, we would be... well, it
would be cattle rustling, if we were to arrive here all macho, with the Army, the
National Guard: “This belongs to the State...” No, that would not be the law or
anything, it would be a real abuse. Therefore | want to affectionately salute the owners
of the Compafiia Inglesa [...]."
On 12 May 2006, Vestey requested the suspension of the ICSID proceedings. While
it did not revoke its resolutions concerning Hatos Los Cocos and La Bendicién
Ramera, INTI issued productivity certificates for all the remaining Farms except Hato
El Carmen.

In 2007, Vestey sold Hato Guataparo to a private person.

SQUATTERS AT HATO MoRICHITO

In May 2008, 30 to 40 indigenous families entered Hato Morichito, burned the fields
and settled down on the farm land.*° The Claimant alleges that Venezuela took no
action to expel the squatters from Hato Morichito and that Ms. dos Santos raised the
issue during a meeting with Minister Loyo without success.

In a letter dated 21 January 2009, the head of the RLO of the state of Apure, informed
the National Guard about the settlement of indigenous families on the territory of Hato

Morichito and requested help to provide them with agricultural infrastructure and water
supply.*”

The Respondent concedes that there was a "minor intrusion" into Hato Morichito, but
asserts that the Claimant complained about it for the first time one year later on 11
May 2009 when Agroflora requested an injunction from the Superior Agrarian Court.*®

It is undisputed that this request for injunction was still at the stage of a summons in
2011 when the Respondent took control of the Farms ({{96-107 below).

NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE SALE OF AGROFLORA

In late 2008, the Respondent initiated negotiations with Vestey with a view to buying
Agroflora. Then, in March 2009, Ms. dos Santos and the Vice-President of Agroflora
met with Mr. Ramirez, the President of state-owned PDVSA Agricola to discuss the
prospects of a sale of Agroflora’s shares to PDVSA Agricola. During the following
month, Mr. Ramirez, with a delegation from PDVSA Agricola, including management,
technicians and veterinarians, visited Agroflora's premises and inspected the Farms
in the state of Apure for one week.

Several meetings followed such inspection and, on 2 July 2009, Vestey Farms,
represented by Mr. Edelmann, and PDVSA Agricola, represented by Mr. Ramirez,
signed a letter of intent.*° The letter of intent recorded that the parties were interested
in entering into a sale and purchase of the totality of the shares of Agroflora. It also
laid down certain modalities of payment in installments for the event that the parties
would agree on a price.

In November 2009, Ernst & Young carried out a valuation of Agroflora's assets upon
the instruction of PDVSA Agricola. The valuation process included visits to the Farms
and a review of documents necessary for a due diligence exercise.

On 3 March 2010, the parties met again to discuss the terms of the sale and purchase.
Two days later, Mr. Edelmann wrote to Mr. Ramirez accepting to sell all the shares of
Agroflora at the price of USD 120 million to be paid in instalments, terms which -

according to him - had been proposed at a meeting held at the offices of PDVSA
Agricola.°

Approximately three months later, Minister Loyo called Ms. dos Santos to a meeting,
where he informed her that the MOA would replace PDVSA Agricola in the sale and
purchase negotiations.

Thereafter, on 17 August 2010, President Chavez approved a directive ("punto de
cuenta") of the MOA, pursuant to which the government was authorized to pay
between 247.5 million and 302.5 million bolivars for the acquisition of Agroflora. This
valuation assigned no value to Agroflora's land.

Following up on the directive, on 29 September 2010, Minister Loyo wrote to Ms. dos
Santos offering a price of 247.5 million bolivars.5' The following day, Ms. dos Santos
replied with a counteroffer of 273 million bolivars. She specifically referred to Vestey's
right to repatriate the funds at the exchange rate of 1 USD to 2.60 bolivars pursuant
to Article 2 of the Exchange Agreement No.14 issued by the Minister of Popular Power
of Economy and Finance.*?

On 26 November 2010, Mr. Edelmann signed a term sheet, which insisted on Vestey
being entitled to convert the proceeds of the sale, i.e. 273 million bolivars at 4.30
bolivars for 1 USD through CADIVI, the Venezuelan Foreign Currency Administration:

“a. It is the essence of this agreement that [Vestey] shall obtain from the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela, through Venezuelan Exchange authorities, the payment for
the sale of the shares [of Agroflora] at the Exchange rate of four point thirty bolivars
per one United States dollar.

b. —[Vestey] shall process the purchase price through C.A.D.I.V.1 in conformity with
the legislation of Venezuela, and, to this end, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
shall proceed with this state entity to affect the above-established conversion of the
purchase price in an expeditious manner.” 53

On 4 February 2011, President Chavez approved the directive authorizing the
purchase of Agroflora for 273 million bolivars. The directive did not refer to the
conversion of such amount nor to an exchange rate.®*

In May 2011, Minister Loyo and Ms. dos Santos discussed the possibility that Vestey
obtain the conversion of the purchase price from bolivars into US dollars through
CADIVI. Ms. dos Santos then met the Head of the International Transactions
Department and Chief Legal Advisor of CADIVI, who - according to the Claimant -
advised that, as a foreign enterprise, Vestey could not register with CADIVI to buy
and transfer US Dollars outside Venezuela. On 16 May 2011, Ms. dos Santos
informed Minister Loyo about the outcome of the meeting with CADIVI.5>

On 26 August 2011, the MOA sent Vestey a new draft sale and purchase
agreement.® The draft did not refer to a payment in US dollars or to the conversion
of the purchase price into a foreign currency.

In mid-September 2011, Minister Loyo again met with Ms. dos Santos. He reiterated
the offer of payment in bolivars, but Ms. dos Santos objected that Vestey was not
prepared to accept a payment in local currency without a guarantee that it could be
converted into US dollars currency.

On 21 September 2011, Ms. dos Santos reported to Mr. Edelmann about such
meeting.” Shortly thereafter, on 9 October 2011, she advised Minister Loyo that his
offer was unacceptable and that Vestey would only continue negotiations on the
premises that the payment be made in a foreign currency.**

2011 RECOVERY

On 30 October 2011, at the meeting of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, the
MOA presented a draft directive to President Chavez. The directive sought the
President’s approval to either purchase Agroflora with a payment in US dollars or
recover the Farms pursuant to the Land Law.®® The President approved the recovery
and made a public statement declaring “the initiation of the administrative proceedings

of recovery of land for exceptional circumstances of social interest and public use”.©°
He continued: “With this we take the complete administrative and operational control
of Agropecuaria Flora. ... Rumbo al socialismo!” ®'

On the following day, Minister Loyo made a public statement asserting that the
President's declaration “implies that the Bolivarian government assume immediate
control of all the operations carried out by this transnational corporation [Vestey]."®
On 1 and 2 November 2011, Vestey received from INTI the notices of recovery for
each one of the eleven Farms.® The notices cited Article 84 of the Land Law allowing
recovery based on exceptional interests of public utility and social use, regardless of
the productivity of the land in question.

While delivering the recovery notices, the representatives of INTI insisted on taking
over the administration of Agroflora. They left, however, after they were advised that
the recovery notices did not give them the right to do so. On 11 November 2011,
Agroflora challenged the recovery notices in court.

Subsequently, governmental commissions composed of representatives of INTI and
semi-armed members of the group called “Marisela”, accompanied by armed forces,
entered into the Farms and assumed control. INTI and Marisela rivaled to establish
control over Agroflora’s operations. Following the takeover, Agroflora’s staff received
a number of contradictory instructions from the representatives of INTI and Marisela.®
Despite advice to the contrary from the staff, the new administration conducted a
cattle count in November at a time when the cows were pregnant. As a result, many
cows miscarried and lost calves. The Marisela workers also disarmed the security
guards in charge of defending the borders of the Farms.®’ As a result, cattle theft
increased. Several Marisela workers also began slaughtering cattle for their personal
consumption. There were instances when Marisela workers invaded the personal

premises where Agroflora’s farm managers lived with their families. As a result,
Agroflora’s farm managers and several chief staff, including John Smith, who had
been in charge of Agroflora’s cattle operations, decided to resign.®°

On 13 November 2011, Ms. dos Santos wrote to Minister Loyo asking for a meeting
in an attempt to find an amicable solution.”° Her message remained unanswered.

In another attempt, Vestey wrote to President Chavez on 25 November 2011. It
complained about the expropriation of its cattle farming business without payment of
compensation, as well as of multiple breaches of the 2006 Agreement, Venezuelan
law and international law. Vestey insisted that, if the government did not offer
compensation, it would resume the ICSID proceedings.”! It received no answer.

On 30 November 2011, the MOA sought interim measures from the Superior Agrarian
Court authorizing it to assume control over Agroflora's operations. The request noted
that the purpose of the recovery was to allow "all domestic livestock producers,
whether large, medium or small, the possibility of accessing developed genetic
material through the sale of semen and bulls at affordable prices for the national agro-
industrial sector of the economy" and to "strengthen and ensure the raising and fertility
of the livestock with high genetic value."”2

On the very next day, on 1 December 2011, the Superior Agrarian Court granted the
interim measures, allowing the MOA to occupy, possess and use Agroflora's property.
The order also provided for the creation of an ad hoc administrative board, composed
of three public officials to supervise the management and administration of
Agroflora.”3

On 5 December 2011, the Superior Agrarian Court served the interim order on
Agroflora. On the same day, the MOA notified Agroflora of the appointment of the
ad hoc administrative board composed of Messrs. Tomas Rodriguez, Angel Aleman

and Richard Diaz. The ad hoc board assumed the management of Agroflora and later
dismissed Ms. dos Santos from her position as President of Agroflora.

On 9 December 2011, the Claimant filed an appeal from the decision granting the
interim measures.”4 The appeal was dismissed about 20 months later on 13 August
2013.75 The Claimant alleges that it was never served with the decision dismissing
the appeal and that it learned of it through the Respondent's Rejoinder.

On 19 December 2011, as a conclusive step of the recovery proceedings, INTI issued
the final decisions of recovery for each of the Farms, thereby rejecting Agroflora's
challenge of the earlier recovery notices.’° The Claimant similarly alleges that it did
not receive any of these final recovery decisions until the submission of the
Respondent's Counter-Memorial.’”

The Respondent maintains that, after the recovery, it approached the Claimant's
representatives to offer compensation”®, a fact that the Claimant denies.’9

2. The relevance of previous decisions or awards

Both Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards in support of their positions,
either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present case or in
an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.

The Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions. At the same time,
in its judgment it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international
tribunals. Specifically, it believes that, subject to compelling grounds to the contrary,
it has a duty to adopt principles established in a series of consistent cases. It further
believes that, subject always to the text of the BIT and the circumstances of each
particular case, it has a duty to contribute to the harmonious development of
international investment law, with a view to meeting the legitimate expectations of the

community of states and investors towards legal certainty and the rule of law.

3. Applicable law to jurisdiction and merits

It is common ground between the Parties that jurisdiction must be established under
both Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the BIT. Subject to the defenses
discussed below, there is agreement that the jurisdictional requirements of these two
instruments are met, and rightly so.

It is equally undisputed that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is governed by international law
(save of course when international law refers to municipal law, which it does, for
instance, in connection with the legality requirement; see 202-206 below). Similarly,
it is uncontroversial that the interpretation of the ICSID Convention and the BIT is
governed by customary international law as codified in the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 (“VCLT’). It is finally accepted that the Tribunal has
the power to rule on its own jurisdiction.*"

As to the law applicable to the merits, the Tribunal must resort to Article 42(1) of the
ICSID Convention, which reads as follows:
“The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be
agreed by the parties. In the absence of such an agreement, the Tribunal shall apply
the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict
of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.”
The Parties have not agreed on the rules of law that govern the merits of this dispute.
Consequently, the Tribunal shall apply, in addition to the Treaty, Venezuelan law and

81 Article 41(1), ICSID Convention.

28

international law when appropriate. The Tribunal is of the view that the second
sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention does not allocate matters to either
law. It is thus for the Tribunal to determine whether an issue is subject to national or

international law.®

118. When applying the law (whether national or international), the Tribunal is of the view

that it is not bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. The principle
iura novit curia — or better, iura novit arbiter — allows the Tribunal to form its own
opinion of the meaning of the law, provided that it does not surprise the Parties with
a legal theory that was not subject to debate and that the Parties could not
anticipate.®°

4. Procedural objections at the hearing

119. In the course of the hearing, the Parties made a few procedural objections. At the end

of the hearing, the Claimant indicated that there remained no unresolved objections.
The Respondent, however, maintained the objections put forward throughout the
hearing. The Tribunal has considered and resolved the objections during the
hearing. For the sake of the record, the Tribunal restates its decisions on those main
objections.

a. Exhibit C-178

120. In its opening statement, Venezuela relied on a word document which was purportedly

82 See, e.

&

attached to the email presented by the Claimant as exhibit C-178. The Respondent
maintained that the author, Mr. Tomas Rodriguez, an employee of the MOA, first sent
the email and its attachment to Minister Loyo, and then forwarded it to Ms. dos Santos.
The word document, entitled “Agroflora Justificativo de divisas’, had been prepared

by Agroflora’s advisors in order to persuade the government to pay for Agroflora in
foreign currency. The Respondent sought to rely on the metadata of the word
document in order demonstrate its origins and the date of its creation. According to
Venezuela, Mr. Tomas Rodriguez misled Minister Loyo by not mentioning that the
document originated from Agroflora.®° He now faces criminal charges. This matter,
says the Respondent, is outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, since it involves issues
of criminal law.

The Claimant objected to the Respondent's reliance on the content of the word
document. According to Vestey, the word document is not in the record. Exhibit C-
178 is an email from Mr. Tomas Rodriguez to Ms. dos Santos, which forwards an
email earlier sent to Minister Loyo. The attachment is not included in Exhibit C-178. If
Venezuela wished to rely on the attached word document, says the Claimant, it should
have introduced it into the record. That would allow the Claimant to refute the
arguments which Venezuela purports to make in connection with that document. In
any event, the Claimant adds that the authorship of the document is undisputed, as it
had noted in its Memorial (footnote 297) that Agroflora’s external counsel had
prepared that word document.

After the Claimant's explanation that the document originated from Agroflora’s
advisors, the President of the Tribunal asked the Respondent whether the explanation
as to the authorship of the document and the reference to footnote 297 of the
Claimant's memorial resolved the matter.®” Counsel for the Respondent answered
affirmatively.®° Therefore, the Tribunal deemed the procedural incident resolved. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal has not relied on Exhibit C-178 or its attachment
in the following analysis. Nor did the Tribunal rely on the statement or conduct of Mr.
Tomas Rodriguez.

b. Sequestration of Diana dos Santos

Ms. dos Santos stated during her cross-examination on the second day of the hearing
that she was informed of Mr. Tomas Rodriguez's arrest.®° The arrest having been
mentioned on the first day of the hearing, the Respondent raised an objection,
according to which the witness’s knowledge of the content of the hearing was a

violation of the procedural rules. In particular, the Respondent referred to paragraph
11.6 of Procedural Order No. 7 providing for the sequestration of witnesses. In the
Respondent's opinion, a witness may not become privy of the content of the hearing
before he or she takes the witness stand.

124. The Claimant replied that paragraph 11.6 of Procedural Order No. 7 meant that a

witness shall not attend a hearing prior to his or her examination and shall have no
communication with the Party offering his or her evidence from the moment the
examination begins. In any event, according to the Claimant, counsel had merely
asked Ms. dos Santos on the eve of her appearance whether she was aware of Mr.
Rodriguez's detention.°"

125. Faced with these positions, the Tribunal invited the Parties to examine the text of

paragraph 11.6 of Procedural Order No. 7, which reads as follows:

“(a) In accordance with paragraph 14.19 of Procedural Order No. 1, fact witnesses
are not permitted to attend the hearing (including the opening arguments) before their
testimony but can attend thereafter. Expert witnesses can attend the hearing at any
time, both before and after their testimony.

(b) Once their testimonies have begun, witnesses and experts shall be isolated until
they have completed their testimony and shall have no contact with the Party which
presented them, or that Party's Counsel, during any recesses or interruptions that
may arise. In addition, fact witnesses shall not read the transcript before their
testimony is closed.”

126. The Tribunal noted that it read the provision to bar a fact witness from attending the

hearing before the oral examination and to require sequestration or isolation
throughout the duration of the oral examination.% In the Tribunal’s view, the provision
had not been breached, since Ms. dos Santos had not attended the hearing before
her oral testimony or communicated with the Claimant and its counsel after her
examination began. On this basis, the Tribunal deemed the procedural objection
resolved.® It asked the Respondent if the proceedings could move on and received
a positive answer.%4

130.

On the second day of the hearing, the Respondent requested that Vestey produce
the documents pertaining to the legal opinion given by Baker & McKenzie to Agroflora
in connection with the legality of the requirement to prove chain-of-title. According to
Venezuela, it emerged from Mr. George Vestey’s cross-examination that Baker &
McKenzie had given the advice to Agroflora and not to Vestey and that the former had
shared it with the latter. Hence, says the Respondent, Vestey cannot claim that the
documents are privileged.

The Claimant opposed the request on several grounds. First, it maintained that
Venezuela could and should have requested those documents during the document
production phase. Second, because all documents were seized by the government in
2011, the documents exchanged between Baker & McKenzie and Agroflora were
since in the Respondent's possession. Third, Vestey claimed that the documents are
protected by attorney-client privilege, as Mr. Vestey had not said that Agroflora shared
the legal advice with Vestey. He was simply aware of the conclusions of that opinion
in his capacity of a member of Vestey’s board of directors.

The Tribunal asked whether Venezuela had submitted the same request at the
document production stage. Counsel for the Respondent contested in the negative
and explained that the need to consult those documents only arose after Ms. dos
Santos relied on them during her cross-examination. The Tribunal noted that it would
assess testimonies of witnesses having due regard to all the surrounding
circumstances that affect the credibility of the statements of a particular witness,
including the absence from the record of any document on which the witness relies in
his or her answers. Upon this explanation, the Respondent modified the request and
asked the Tribunal leave to rely on the fact of the existence of those documents.
The Tribunal concurred, and the hearing went on.

The Tribunal considers the above procedural objections to be minor incidents with no
effect on the content of the Award. They are mentioned for the sole purpose of the
avoidance of doubt. It is indeed telling that none of the Parties has put forward any
complaints in connection with the Tribunal’s handling of the hearing in their post
hearing briefs. The Tribunal thus trusts that all objections have been satisfactorily
resolved.

PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

%5 Transcript, English, Day 2, 138:6-15.

32

131. The Respondent has raised the following preliminary objections involving the lack of
identity of the present dispute and the one submitted to arbitration (1), and the
absence of an investment (2).

1. Lack of Identity of the Disputes

132. This preliminary objection which was first raised during the opening statement at the
hearing,® relates to the alleged lack of identity between the dispute originally
registered with the Center and the dispute now before the Tribunal. The Claimant
opposes this objection as untimely and in any event unsubstantiated.

133. Because this objection had not been raised earlier, the Tribunal invited the
Respondent to set it forth in an additional submission filed on 29 January 2015
(Escrito Adicional: Objeciones Jurisdiccionales y de Admisibilidad) and gave the
Claimant an opportunity to respond in writing by 31 January 2015. The Parties also
addressed this objection in their post-hearing briefs, both in terms of timeliness or
admissibility and substance.

a. The Respondent’s Position

134. The Respondent submits that this objection is admissible irrespective of the time when
it was raised. In support, it relies on ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) according to which
an ICSID tribunal may assess its jurisdiction sua sponte at any stage of the arbitration.
For Venezuela, this rule entails that the Tribunal must examine a jurisdictional
objection even if it is belated or has not been raised at all. In reliance on decisions of
ICSID tribunals®” and of the ICJ,°* the Respondent contends that jurisdiction cannot
be acquired by way of estoppel.

96 Counsel for the Respondent argued that “the measures that [...] the Tribunal has to decide upon [...]
were not included in that registration request” (Transcript, English, Day 1, 222:10-13). The President
then asked if the Respondent was “raising a new [...] objection [...]: that there is no identity between
the claims as they stand today and the claims as they were brought in the request for arbitration in
2005?” ” (Transcript, English, Day 1, 222:21-25). The Respondent's counsel replied that “paragraph
4(h) of the [Claimant's] jurisdiction rejoinder [...] cuts any link there may be between the original
claims of the request for arbitration and the present claims [...]” (Transcript, English, Day 1, 225:12-
16). After the President's further question about the nature of the new objection, the Respondent's
counsel noted: “We could call it a matter of inadmissibility; we could call it a consequence of the
same objection of no investment” (Transcript, English, Day 1, 227:3-5).

On the merits of the defense, the Respondent argues that “the Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction due to the complete lack of identity between the claims before it and the
claims presented upon registration that gave rise to these arbitration proceedings.”°°
The 2006 Agreement settled the original legal dispute. The issues and the legal
framework which the Claimant invoked thereafter “are completely different” from those
relied upon when it started the arbitration in 2005. 1°

To substantiate its claim of difference, the Respondent refers to paragraph 4.h of the
Claimant's rejoinder on jurisdiction’, which supposedly shows that Vestey does not
challenge the Land Law itself, but only “how the law was applied”. 1°?

The dispute about the application of the Land Law, so says the Respondent, is a new
dispute that could not have existed at the time of the Request for Arbitration. In light
of the 2006 Agreement, “there is a complete termination of the claims contained in
the Request for Arbitration which gave rise to the arbitration proceedings”.1° In this
context, Venezuela invokes Azpetrol, where the tribunal declined jurisdiction due to a
binding settlement agreement entered into between the parties. 1°

The Respondent adds that the representatives of the Claimant have acknowledged
the settlement of the original dispute. It points in particular to a letter from Ms. dos
Santos to President Chavez, saying that the 2006 Agreement established a solid
basis for the “alliance” between the government and Agroflora.'°° The Respondent
also relies on Lord Vestey’s communication to President Chavez saying that he was
delighted to have reached an amicable settlement. 1°

The Respondent further refutes Vestey’s invocation of ICSID Arbitration Rule 40(1) 1°”
as this rule only governs incidental or additional claims and therefore does not apply
here. In this case, the new claims concern an entirely new legal dispute, which

107 ICSID Rule 40(1) reads as follows:
“Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an incidental or additional
claim or counter-claim arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, provided
that such ancillary claim is within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise
within the jurisdiction of the Centre.”

replaced the original dispute.'°° As a consequence, the Respondent concludes that
“it is impossible to consider that Venezuela has given its consent to an arbitration
proceeding whose alleged causes have completely changed to the point that there is
no identity between them and those stated in the request for arbitration that gave rise
to such proceeding”. 1°°

b. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant contends that this objection is inadmissible, because it is raised too late.
It in particular cites to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), which provides that jurisdictional
defenses must be raised “as early as possible”.

According to the Claimant, the Respondent had ample opportunity to raise its
objections during the three rounds of written submissions. Even assuming that the
basis for the objection lies in the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the objection would be
time barred since the Rejoinder was filed over eight months prior to the hearing
(Claimant’s submission of 31 January 2015, p.8). “If a Respondent were able to
introduce objections at will in a final hearing”, writes the Claimant, “the most
fundamental rights of due process would be infringed to the Claimant” (Claimant’s
submission of 31 January 2015, p.8).

The Claimant further relies on ICSID Arbitration Rule 27, pursuant to which a party
which knows or should have known of a breach of an applicable rule and which fails
to object promptly, is deemed to have waived its objection. By replying to Vestey’s
arguments without raising an objection, Venezuela waived its right to object.

In any event, the Claimant submits that the nature of the legal dispute initially
registered before the Centre remains unaltered. In the 2006 Agreement, the Parties
did not settle the dispute. Rather, Vestey only agreed to suspend the ICSID
arbitration, while its discontinuance was “specifically made subject to the prior
fulfilment by the INTI of ‘each and all’ of its obligations under that Agreement”."'°
Under Article 8 of the 2006 Agreement, Venezuela was to revoke the resolutions
against the Farms, recognize the sufficiency of Vestey’s title, and relocate the
squatters. Venezuela failed to fully comply with these obligations. Indeed, Vestey

148.

consistently noted in its correspondence with ICSID and Venezuela after the 2006
Agreement that the implementation of the latter was “still in course”. 1"

In addition, Vestey submits that the requirement of Article 36 of the ICSID Convention
that the Claimant provide “information concerning the issues in dispute” cannot mean
that such information must be exhaustive, nor can it prevent the Claimant from adding
subsequent measures taken against the same investment after the initiation of the
arbitration. 1"?

Finally, if the Claimant’s current claims are considered new or ancillary, they must be
admitted under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 40.
They are directly connected to the subject matter of the dispute and are within the
scope of the consent of the Parties and the jurisdiction of the Centre. ''°

c. Analysis

The Tribunal will first address the admissibility of the new objection. ICSID Arbitration
Rule 41(1) requires that a jurisdictional objection be raised “as early as possible”:

“Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of

the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be

made as early as possible. A party shall file the objection with the Secretary-General

no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the countermemorial,

or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder—unless

the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.”
Venezuela argues that it learned of Vestey’s abandonment of its original claims
through the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, which was filed on 30 May 2014.''4 Be this as
it may, it then waited until the first day of the hearing on 28 January 2015 to raise its
defense. A time lag of eight months does obviously not meet the “as early as possible”
requirement.

The Respondent is of the view that its delay is without consequence as the Tribunal
is under a duty to assess its jurisdiction of its own motion. In support of this argument,
it relies on ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2), which reads as follows:

“The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding,

whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the
Centre and within its own competence.” (Emphasis added)

153.

The Tribunal’s discretionary power to review its jurisdiction ex officio does not absolve
the parties from compliance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1). If Venezuela really
believed that the 2006 Settlement Agreement settled the dispute, that rule would have
required it to raise its objection at the time when the arbitration resumed in 2011.
Similarly, if the supposed novelty of the claims only became apparent in May 2014,
the rule would have required Venezuela to react well before the hearing.

For these reasons, the Tribunal considers this objection untimely and thus
inadmissible. This being so, it notes that if the objection were admissible, it would not
succeed on the merits. Indeed, the Tribunal cannot follow the Respondent when it
argues that the present dispute is entirely different from the one presented in the
Request for Arbitration.

Under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention as well as under the BIT, the Tribunal
must have jurisdiction over the “dispute”. A dispute is not the equivalent of a claim.
The former is a broader concept than the latter. As the CMS tribunal had put it, “the
fact that [the claims] may originate from different sources or emerge at different times
does not necessarily mean that the disputes are separate and distinct.”''S In the
present case, the dispute hinges on the lawfulness of Venezuela’s introduction of
rules for the elimination of idle estates and the measures taken against Vestey’s cattle
farming business under such rules. While the factual matrix of the dispute has evolved
and the formulation of the claims has followed this evolution, the essence of the
dispute is unchanged. A review of the chronology confirms the unity or identity of the
dispute.

In the Request for Arbitration filed in 2005, the Claimant noted that “the Land Law
provided a new legal framework for state intervention with rural land in Venezuela”"'®
and that the “dispute concerns the illegal treatment and confiscation by Venezuela of
the country’s principal cattle farming business, which has been owned by Vestey for
some 90 years”. 117

The 2006 Agreement did not put an end to the dispute so described. The Parties do
not dispute that it merely suspended the arbitration. It failed to resolve the major
aspect of the dispute which turns on the ownership of the Farms. The Respondent
itself argues that the 2006 Agreement did not provide for an unconditional recognition

of Vestey’s title to the Farms.''® Nor did the 2006 Agreement change the allegedly
expropriatory regime of the Land Law about which Claimant complained in its Request
for Arbitration.

The Claimant's submissions after the recommencement of this arbitration in 2011
further demonstrate that the 2006 Agreement did not bring about a solution to the
dispute. The Claimant continued to complain of Venezuela’s adoption of the Land
Law, which, it said, eviscerated “the legal framework upon which landowners like
Vestey had relied”.''9 In its Reply, the Claimant captured the essence of the dispute
as follows:

“As from 2001, the regime of President Chavez decided to fundamentally alter the
concept of ownership of property, annihilating over a hundred years of property rights,
as enshrined in the Constitution, and otherwise in Venezuelan law, by requiring
owners (in some cases decades after the land was purchased with registered title or
acquired by way of acquisitive prescription) to collect and furnish to the government
documentary evidence of a chain of title back to beyond 1848”.120
History did not stand still after Vestey had initiated arbitration in 2005. The situation
evolved, new facts accrued with the Respondent's amendment of the Land Law and
measures taken under its regime, such as the recovery notices, the interim measures
and final recovery. While these developments have densified the dispute, they have

not changed its nature and identity.

In contrast, the Respondent submits that paragraph 4(h) of the Rejoinder on
Jurisdiction demonstrates the termination of the original dispute. The passage quoted
by the Respondent reads as follows: “[t]he 2010 Land Law did not change the system
of registration and ownership of land in Venezuela”. The paragraph, however,
continues to explain: “Nonetheless, it [the Land Law] introduced, by way of Article 82,
an administrative process enabling the INTI to ‘recover’ land ‘attributed to individuals’
(including, according to the INTI, those holding registered title) who could not
document Chain of Title.” Put in their context, these words show no intention to
abandon the original complaint about the unlawfulness of the regime of the Land Law.
Instead, the Claimant continues to denounce the incompatibility of the Land Law with
the rules of private ownership in Venezuela and with Venezuela's obligations under
international law.

118 “(T]he only unqualified obligation that the Republic undertook in the 2006 Agreement was to provide
payment to Agroflora for Hato E/ Charcote and the cattle in Hato San Pablo Paefio” (R-Rejoinder,

120 C-Reply, 9177.

157.

158.

159.

160.

161.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent does not object to the admissibility of
the Claimant's ancillary and new claims under ICSID Arbitration Rule 40(1), and rightly
so. The current claims are indeed closely connected to the original claims, as they
both concern violations of the BIT by measures taken under the Land Law against the
Claimant's cattle farming business.

2. Investment: Lack of Title

The Parties disagree on the existence of a protected investment. Specifically, they
diverge on whether Vestey has made an investment in accordance with the laws of
Venezuela as required by the BIT. Their major difference turns on whether, prior to
the disputed land reform, Venezuelan law required a registered land owner to prove
a perfect chain of title tracing back to the period when the land was first released into
private ownership, in some cases as early as 1848. 121

a. The Respondent's Position

The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention and under the BIT, because the Claimant has made no investment
in accordance with the law of Venezuela as it has not acquired sufficient ownership
title to the Farms.

Venezuela notes that Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention lacks a definition of
“investment” and leaves it to the parties "to define a certain transaction as an
investment or accept certain types of investments under the protection of the
treaty".'? By contrast, Article 13 of the BIT contains a "clear condition imposed by
[Venezuela] and the United Kingdom" that it "applies only to investments made in
accordance with the laws and regulations of the host country". 12°

The Respondent relies on Saba Fakes v. Turkey’ to submit that, if the legality
requirement is not met, the BIT will not apply and there will be no consent to arbitrate
the dispute within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The

125

Respondent also invokes Fraport v. Philippines’, contending that disrespect for the

laws of the host state places an investment outside the protection of the investment
treaty. It adds that Vestey's good faith purchase of the Farms is not disputed. Rather,
the disagreement hinges on Vestey's inability to prove the ownership over the land
under the applicable rules of Venezuelan law. '76

In reliance on Cementownia v. Turkey,'?” Venezuela further submits that the legality
must be assessed on the date of the events which form the basis for the claims.

The Respondent goes on to argue that, in the present case, the Claimant failed to
demonstrate that it made an investment in accordance with the laws of the host
state.'?8 Specifically, the Claimant has not shown that it acquired title over the Farms.
To substantiate this argument, the Respondent contends that "[uJnder the Land Law,
farm lands are considered to be state property unless the possessor can demonstrate
its ownership through a perfect chain of title tracing back to the valid release of the
land by the Venezuelan government". 179

For the Respondent, the requirement of a perfect chain of title is not new; it was
present in Venezuelan law since at least 1936.'°° The legislation governing vacant
land and certain domestic court decisions provide for a presumption that the state is
the owner of vacant agricultural land until a private person proves its ownership.
Specifically, the Respondent relies on the 1848 Vacant Land Law ("Ley de 10 abril de
1848, Sobre Averiguacién de Tierras Baldias, su Deslinde, Mensura, Justiprecio y
Enajenacion"), as well as on 1919 and 1936 Vacant Land Laws, the latter being still
in force.

To substantiate the existence of the presumption, Venezuela particularly cites Article
1 of the 1936 Vacant Land Law, which reads as follows:

“All lands within the borders of the Republic, which are not communal
or private property and do not belong legitimately to corporations or
juridical persons shall be considered vacant.” '

The Respondent also refers to decisions of the Supreme Court of Venezuela handed
down in 1933 and 1991. The latter suggests that Article 1 of the 1936 Vacant Land
Law “creates a legal presumption in favor of the Republic, as claimant, so that it is
only necessary to claim that certain land is vacant for creating the burden of the
respondent to demonstrate its ownership of said lands [...]."1°2

On this basis, the Respondent maintains that Vestey failed to discharge its burden of
proving the ownership over the land. Especially, during the administrative recovery
proceedings initiated by INTI, the Claimant was given multiple opportunities to prove
ownership by showing an uninterrupted chain of title since the time when the land was
first privately owned. The Claimant failed to do so and expressly recognized that

failure in its internal communications.‘

The Respondent further contends that the extracts from the Public Registry presented
by the Claimant" in an attempt to prove ownership contain numerous inaccuracies,
especially with respect to the areas of land. In any event, the Respondent argues that
the registration merely proves “just title” ("justo titulo"), which is not sufficient to prove
ownership. Just title shows the good faith intentions of the parties to a transaction.
However, it does not establish that title was legally transferred, since no one can
transfer more rights than he or she holds. Hence, any deficiency in the title that may
have existed earlier in the chain affects the validity of all subsequent titles.

Consequently, for Venezuela, "Vestey's inability to prove a perfect chain of title means
that Vestey has not made an ‘investment’ in accordance with the laws of
Venezuela”.'*> Moreover, "even if the Tribunal were to consider the Farms to be an
“investment” under the Treaty, they are not an investment of a national of a
Contracting Party, as required by Article 2 of the Treaty. Without perfect title, Vestey
is not the lawful owner of the Farms and, as such, is not an investor within the meaning
of the Treaty". 196

b. The Claimant's Position

The Claimant first submits that Venezuela’s objection concerning land ownership
“cannot go to jurisdiction”.'°” Irrespective of the Tribunal's finding on the title over the

land, its ownership over the "buildings, infrastructure, improvements to the land,
livestock or vehicles that were seized by the Venezuelan government in November
2011 has not been contested by the Respondent".'** Thus, according to the Claimant,
"[t]here can be no doubt that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Vestey's claims insofar
as they relate to the seizure of these (non-land) assets by Venezuela”. 1°

The Claimant accepts that jurisdiction only extends to disputes arising out of an
investment made in accordance with the laws of the host state. It submits that it has
made such an investment as it held registered title over the Farms. For Vestey, such
registered title is sufficient ownership title under Venezuelan law.

About the alleged inaccuracies in the registered land areas, the Claimant explains
that “many of Agroflora’s old registered titles did not employ modern measurement
techniques and referred often to physical defining features and so the listed areas do
not always correspond precisely to what can now be measured with precision”. 14° In
any event, the discrepancies between the actual surface of the Farms and their
registered surface has no impact on Vestey’s ownership. '41

Furthermore, the Claimant submits that Venezuela's reliance on the Land Law and in
particular on Article 84 of the 2010 Land Law introducing the requirement of the
perfect chain of title is a matter for the merits. For Vestey, the Land Law is itself a
measure in breach of the BIT, which allowed Venezuela to recover the land without
compensation.'#? If Venezuela could rely on the Land Law to avoid jurisdiction, the
treaty protections would become illusory.'43 Or in Claimant’s words, "Venezuela
cannot avoid its liability under the Treaty by invoking its own domestic law, and the
very measure that constitutes part and parcel of its wrongful conduct under the Treaty
and international law".144

According to the Claimant, the existence of an investment and hence the validity of
the title over the assets comprising an investment must be assessed as of “the date
on which the measures that gave rise to the dispute took place”.'45 Thus, for
jurisdictional purposes the Claimant only needs to demonstrate that it held an

ownership title over the Farms before the introduction of the measures complained of
in this arbitration.

To prove that it acquired the ownership title over the land, the Claimant relies on the
presumption of validity of its registered title. The Civil Code of Venezuela and the Law
of Public Registry provide that the registered title constitutes valid and sufficient title.
For Vestey, only a final judicial decision can invalidate a registered ownership title.

In addition, the Claimant invokes the principle of acquisitive prescription. The Civil
Code of Venezuela provides for the acquisition of ownership by operation of continued
and uninterrupted possession of the land for more than 10 years. In reply to the
Respondent's argument that acquisitive prescription may only be declared by a judge,
the Claimant asserts that it raised acquisitive prescription in court proceedings in 2005
when it sought the annulment of INTI's resolutions. The Agrarian Court considered
however, that annulment proceedings were not the appropriate procedural setting to
rule on a claim of acquisitive prescription. The Claimant could not have presented an
independent request for declaration of acquisitive prescription as, according to the
Code of Civil Procedure, an action for declaration of acquisitive prescription may be
filed against persons who are registered owners of the real estate in question. As
Vestey was itself a registered owner, it could not have brought the action against
itself.146

The Claimant also opposes the Respondent's argument that Venezuelan Law
required demonstrating the perfect chain of title even prior to the introduction of the
Land Law. The 1848 Vacant Land Law merely "provided a way for occupiers or
tenants of vacant lands to be transferred ownership of lands — nothing else".'*” As for
the 1919 Vacant Land Law, the Claimant contends that "Article 6.3 required proof of
title (such as the registered title) for land acquired after 10 April 1848 but did not
require proof of a chain of title back to or before that date".'4® Under 1936 Vacant
Land Law, the possessors of land were only required to show title "in cases where
their possession of allegedly idle land was being challenged before a court pursuant
to Article 10 of the same law".149

Moreover, according to Vestey, the 1991 Supreme Court decision invoked by the
Respondent did not require a chain of title to prove ownership; registered title is
sufficient for purposes of proof of ownership. '°

Further, to refute the Respondent's argument that Agroflora's staff acknowledged not
being able to prove title, the Claimant submits that "[t]hese emails (written by business
executives, not lawyers) do nothing more than discuss the INTI's unreasonable
requests for Agroflora to produce documentation to prove Chain of Title. At no stage
do these communications acknowledge that the INTI's requirements were legal or
properly applied to Agroflora as a matter of Venezuelan law". 15!

Finally, the Claimant invokes the principle of estoppel to argue that, in light of the
government's prior recognition of Vestey’s title on multiple occasions and “after
decades of peaceful possession [...], Venezuela must be prevented from changing
course at this stage and denying the validity of Vestey's title in this arbitration". 152

c. Analysis

As mentioned earlier, jurisdiction must be established under both the ICSID
Convention and the BIT. Both instruments make jurisdiction conditional upon the
existence of an investment. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention does so in the

following terms:

"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of
an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency
of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of
another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit
to the Centre.”

And Article 8 of the BIT reads as follows:

"Disputes between a national or company of one Contracting Party and the other
Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter under this Agreement in
relation to an investment of the former [...] shall [...] be submitted to international
arbitration [ICSID]"

Article 13 of the BIT further specifies the scope of application of the treaty and
introduces a legality requirement with the following wording:

151 C-Rejoinder, 943.
152 C-Reply, 4173.

186.

187.

188.

"The present Agreement shall apply to investments in the territory of one Contracting
Party made in accordance with its laws and regulations by nationals or companies of
the other Contracting Party ..."

It is common ground between the Parties that the investment must satisfy the legality

requirement of Article 13 of the BIT to be protected.

In the following section, the Tribunal will start by determining whether there is an
investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention (i) and of the BIT (ii). It will
then assess if the investment at issue is an investment "of" the Claimant as required
by Article 8(1) of the BIT (iii). Thereafter, the Tribunal will analyze whether the
investment complies with the requirement of legality contained in Article 13 of the BIT
(iv). It will not address the other jurisdictional requirements of the ICSID Convention
and the BIT, which are undisputed and rightly so.

i. Investment under the ICSID Convention

The lack of definition in the ICSID Convention does not deprive the term “investment’
of its significance. Like any other term of a treaty, it must be interpreted on the basis
of its ordinary meaning, in its context, and in the light of the treaty's object and
purpose. "8°

A majority of ICSID tribunals hold that the term "investment" in Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention has an independent meaning.'* On the basis of ICSID jurisprudence as
it has evolved, it can now be considered that the definition of "investment" comprises
three components: a commitment or allocation of resources, risk, and duration. 1°

The Parties do not dispute that during more than a century from 1909 to 2011, Vestey
contributed substantial resources to establish and operate cattle farming enterprise in
Venezuela. It paid for the land, livestock, vehicles and other equipment; it incurred the
costs for maintaining the Farms, creating and improving pastures, and genetically
improving the herd. It is not disputed that Vestey's operations in Venezuela involved
risks; nor that Vestey operated in Venezuela for a long time.

193.

Hence, Vestey’s business in Venezuela meets the definition of investment within the
meaning of the ICSID convention.

ii. Investment under the BIT
Article 1 of the BIT defines investment as follows:

Investment’ means every kind of asset and in particular, though not exclusively,
includes:

(i) movable and immovable property and any other property rights such as mortgages
liens or pledges;

(ii) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of
participation in a company;

(iii) claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value;
(iv) intellectual property rights, goodwill, technical processes and know-how;

(v) business concessions conferred by Law or under contract, including concessions
to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources.

A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as
investments,"

Vestey held 100% ownership interest in its cattle farming enterprise, i.e. Agroflora.
Vestey's shareholding in Agroflora clearly falls within the BIT's list of assets and, in
particular, under the category of "shares in and stock and debentures of a company
and any other form of participation in a company."

In line with a series of more recent decisions, '® the Tribunal is of the opinion that the
BIT notion of investment implies that the asset falling within the list be the result of an
allocation of resources made by the investor. In this case, as was just mentioned, it is
undisputed that Vestey contributed substantial economic resources into its
Venezuelan cattle farming business. This condition is thus met.

iii. Investment “of” an investor

The consent to arbitrate expressed in Article 8 of the BIT covers disputes about the
Respondent's obligations "in relation to an investment of the national or company" of
the other Contracting State. It is common ground that Vestey qualifies as such a
"national or company" of the UK. The Respondent, however, maintains that the

investment is not an investment "of" Vestey, as Vestey failed to acquire the necessary
title over the land.'5”

The Parties do not dispute that Venezuelan law governs the issue of ownership of the
asset constituting the purported investment. '5® While the term “investment” itself is to
be defined under the applicable rules of international law, '° the question whether or
not the Claimant holds title over the assets constituting an investment is a matter of
municipal law. 1°

In the present case, the investment out of which the dispute arose is Vestey’s interest
in the cattle farming enterprise, Agroflora, a company incorporated under Venezuelan
law. The relevant inquiry is thus whether the Claimant held title to the shares in
Agroflora under Venezuelan law.

The question remains whether Vestey also needs to show title to the individual assets
(land, livestock, equipment, vehicles, etc.) to hold an investment and, hence, for
jurisdiction to be established over this dispute. In the Tribunal’s opinion, this question
must be answered in the negative. This dispute arises out of measures affecting
Vestey's interest in the cattle farming enterprise in its entirety. The measures were
not directed exclusively at individual assets, such as the land plots. They targeted the
enterprise as a whole. It is thus the cattle farming enterprise as a whole that must
qualify as an investment of an investor.

The reasoning of the Holiday Inns tribunal is instructive in this regard:

"It is well known [...] that investment is accomplished by a number of juridical acts of

all sorts. It would not be consonant either with economic reality or with the intention

of the parties to consider each of these acts in complete isolation from the others."'5"
Therefore, to conclude that the present dispute arises directly out of an investment of

an investor, it is sufficient to find that Vestey held title to the shares in Agroflora. Title

to the individual assets will certainly be relevant to determine the value of the allegedly
expropriated investment. This is, however, a question for the merits.

The case law relied upon by the Respondent confirms this approach limiting the
jurisdictional enquiry to the ownership of the shares. In Libananco v. Turkey, the
tribunal indeed held that:
“Turkish law applies to the issue of whether (and when) Libananco acquired the
shares in question and thus had an “Investment” under Article 26(1) of the ECT and
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. "©
Nowhere did the Libananco tribunal analyze whether the local subsidiary held each
and every asset in accordance with the applicable rules of ownership. Venezuela
shares such understanding, when it notes that the Libananco tribunal declined
jurisdiction because of the claimant's failure to prove title to the shares “over which
the measures in question applied”'®°. The reasoning in Saba Fakes was similar, when
the Tribunal enquired into the claimant's ownership of the shares in the local
company. '4

It is undisputed that Vestey owned Agroflora's shares and Vestey presented
registered corporate documents to this effect.'®° Nothing in the record suggests nor
is it alleged that Vestey did not follow Venezuelan law when it acquired the shares.
Therefore, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that the present dispute arises out of the
investment "of" the Claimant.

iv. Investment made in accordance with Venezuelan law

Even when the dispute arises out of an investment of an investor, the Tribunal may
lack jurisdiction if the investment was made in violation of the host state's law. The
Respondent is right when it maintains that the legality requirement set forth in Article
13 of the BIT limits the scope of BIT application to investments made in compliance
with the rules of the host state.

During the hearing, the President asked the Respondent whether its objection under
Article 13 of the BIT related to the "absence or non-existence of an investment" or

whether it was "an objection based on legality’. The answer was that "the objection is
the existence of the investment because there is no proof of title."1°

The legality requirement enshrined in Article 13 of the BIT is distinct from that of the
existence or ownership of an investment. To conflate the two would imply that an
investment treaty without a legality requirement would do away with the condition of
the existence of ownership of the investment. There is no need for long explanations
to understand that this would be an absurd result. This view is for instance confirmed
when looking at Saba Fakes, which the Respondent cites. There, the tribunal
considered the claimant's failure to acquire the ownership of the shares to be fatal to
its jurisdiction under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1 (definition of
investment) of the Netherlands-Turkey BIT, irrespective of the legality requirement in
Article 2(2) of that investment treaty. 1°”

The Respondent does not allege that Vestey committed a violation of Venezuelan law
when attempting to acquire the land. Nor does it dispute that Vestey acted in good
faith in connection with the acquisition of the land.'® It rather argues that the
Claimant's attempt did not succeed because it did not fulfill the requirements for a
valid acquisition of title. Assuming arguendo that this argument were correct, a failed
good faith attempt to acquire property would not constitute a breach of laws and
regulations contrary to the legality requirement. In other words, the objection falls
outside the ambit of Article 13 of the BIT. It invokes the existence and ownership of
the investment, which the Tribunal has already affirmed.

Thus, even if it were established, Vestey’s alleged failure to acquire ownership of the
land would not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction. The Tribunal will therefore address
the issue of Vestey’s land ownership in the context of its analysis of the merits.

LIABILITY

The Claimant argues that Venezuela breached its obligations under the BIT. It
primarily invokes Article 5 of the BIT, contending that Venezuela unlawfully
expropriated Vestey's investment. Moreover, the Claimant argues that Venezuela
breached Article 2 of the BIT by taking arbitrary measures contrary to the standards

166 Transcript, English, Day 6, 162:4-17; Upon the Presiding Arbitrator's further request for clarification
as to whether the objection "[was] purportedly on the basis of the inexistence of the investment" the
Counsel reconfirmed: "Yes, that is correct." (Transcript, English, Day 6, 163:8-10).

167 In any event, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent does not contest the legality of Vestey's

acquisition of the shares in Agroflora.

168 Transcript, English, Day 6, 161:19-24.

212.

of full protection and security and fair and equitable treatment. However, according to
the Claimant, if the Tribunal "make[s] a finding of unlawful expropriation, with the
natural damages consequences", it need not consider the claims related to the
alleged breaches of Article 2 of the BIT.'®

Expropriation
a. The Claimant's Position

The Claimant invokes Article 5 of the BIT, which prohibits expropriation, "except fora
public purpose related to the internal needs of [the State] on a non-discriminatory
basis and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation [...]".17°

The Claimant contends that "[t]he critical factor in determining whether a government
measure constitutes expropriation is the effect that the measure has on the asset in
question; neither the state's intent, nor its subjective motives, nor the form of the
measures are relevant in this regard".171

It adds that measures that “effectively deprive an investor of the use or enjoyment of
its investment, including the deprivation of all or a significant part of the economic
benefit of property, are just as expropriatory as the seizure of an investor's formal title
to his property".172

For the Claimant, the Respondent's justification concerning the absence of a valid title
is "divorced from reality, [and is] a mere pretext to take Vestey's farms without
compensation". In reliance on CME, the Claimant also argues that "a change in the
legal environment does not authorize a host state to deprive a foreign investor of its
investment, unless proper compensation is granted".'74

The Claimant further submits that, through the Land Law, Venezuela set a legal
framework allowing it to take over private property without compensation. This was
followed by the takeover of the Farms and the appointment of the ad hoc
administrative board in November 2011. As a result, "[tloday Vestey has no voting
rights in relation to Agroflora, is unable to select the company’s management or

otherwise control its operations, and cannot sell or pledge any business assets.
Vestey has received no dividends since the takeover, and given that the ad hoc board
is tasked with collecting value for the state, no dividends will be forthcoming in future.
The Claimant has thus, been deprived of all of the fundamental property rights that it
once held in Agroflora and its assets, and no longer receives any economic benefit

from its investment". "75

In rebuttal of Venezuela’s argument that Vestey did not own the Farms because it is
unable to prove a perfect chain of title Vestey states that the requirement of a chain
of title is arbitrary and was introduced by the Land Law, which Venezuela is not
entitled to invoke here. The contrary “would be to give States carte blanche to
circumvent their obligation not to expropriate without compensation simply by passing
a law justifying the seizure of asset in each case on the basis that the government
had determined that the asset actually belonged to the State".176

Vestey claims that it had registered title to the land, which Venezuela endorsed by
acquiescence throughout decades. Since no judicial decision invalidated such
registered title, Vestey must be deemed the legitimate owner of the land under
Venezuelan law. In any event, Vestey notes that its ownership over the movable
property (including livestock, vehicles and other assets) is undisputed. Accordingly,
Venezuela's takeover of the Farms constituted an expropriation.

The Claimant argues that the expropriation effected through the takeover of the Farm
was contrary to Article 5 of the BIT as it was not for a public purpose (i), was conducted
in breach of due process (ii), without compensation (iii); and in a discriminatory
manner (iv).

i. Public purpose

The Claimant’s submission is that the expropriation of Agroflora lacked the public
purpose demanded by Article 5 of the BIT. In spite of the broad margin of appreciation
that is recognized to expropriating states, tribunals do assess the existence of a
genuine public purpose.'”’ For instance, the ADC tribunal scrutinized the justification
advanced by Hungary in the following terms:

"In the Tribunal’s opinion, a treaty requirement for “public interest” requires some
genuine interest of the public. If mere reference to “public interest” can magically put
such interest into existence and therefore satisfy this requirement, then this
requirement would be rendered meaningless since the Tribunal can imagine no
situation where this requirement would not have been met."'76
For Vestey, the requirement of public purpose in Article 5 of the BIT cannot be self-
judging. Otherwise it would lack effet utile, an interpretive result contrary to the
Tribunal’s "duty to interpret and apply the provisions of the Treaty in accordance with
international law".'79

It is Vestey’s submission that the alleged aim of safeguarding the availability of food
for the citizens is not a valid public purpose under the circumstances. In reality,
Agroflora was a very productive cattle farming business which served the domestic
market exclusively, thereby meeting the goal of making food available to the
Venezuelan people. There is no evidence that under the government's control
Agroflora's livestock was sold to the public at subsidized prices, or that purebred cattle
was donated to local farmers to improve the genetic stock of their herd.'®° In fact, so
says Vestey, Venezuela targeted certain agrifood businesses for political reasons and
not for the purposes which it puts forward. 1°"

ii. Due process

The Claimant submits that Article 5 of the BIT affords the expropriated investor the
right to a prompt review of its case and of the valuation of its investments by a judicial
or independent authority. It further argues that it is entitled to broader due process
rights provided by other BITs of Venezuela which are made applicable by way of the
most favored nation (“MFN”) clause of the BIT. In particular, the Claimant seeks to
rely on Article 5 of the BIT between Venezuela and the Czech Republic, which
expressly provides that an expropriation must be carried out "under due process of

law". 182

The Claimant also submits that, in addition to an independent review mechanism, due
process requires compliance with the procedures set forth by domestic law. According
to Vestey, Venezuela failed to follow these procedures. Specifically, INTI's recovery
notices violated the provisions of the Land Law, pursuant to which the interim

measures must specify the period of their application and expressly protect the right
of residence of the squatters. '®° Moreover, as the interim measures did not provide
the legal basis for the seizure of Agroflora's assets other than the land, the
government asked the court to establish an ad hoc administrative board. The court
granted this request in one day even though there was no threat of dissipation of the
assets.

According to the Claimant, the expropriation process also failed to comply with
Venezuela's own Expropriation Law, which imposes amicable negotiations involving
the valuation of the property by three experts. The Respondent admits, so says
Vestey, that it did not apply the Expropriation Law. 1%

Moreover, Venezuela never informed the Claimant of the final Recovery Decisions of
19 December 2011. It is Vestey’s case that it did not learn about their existence until
it received Venezuela's Counter-Memorial. It was thus prevented from filing an appeal
in time.'® Similarly, the Supreme Court's decision of 13 August 2013 dismissing
Agroflora's appeal against the order for interim measures was not communicated to
Vestey until the Respondent filed it as an exhibit to its Rejoinder in this arbitration.

Overall, these multiple procedural flaws deprived Vestey of its right to a prompt review
of its case and of the valuation of its investments by a judicial or independent authority.
It is thus Vestey’s submission that Venezuela breached the due process requirement
embodied in Article 5 of the BIT.”

iii. Compensation

The Claimant contends that the Respondent failed to provide prompt, adequate and
effective compensation as required by Article 5 of the BIT. The requirement that
compensation be prompt implies that the monies be paid as soon as possible. The
compensation must also be adequate, i.e. "equivalent to the full value of the asset
taken".'®8 Moreover, the Claimant relies on Articles 5 and 6 of the BIT to suggest that
the compensation must "be effectively realizable and be freely transferable" and

"should be paid in a currency that can be immediately converted into other currencies
on the foreign exchange market". 18

The Claimant refutes the Respondent's invocation of the offer made during the 2010
purchase negotiations. For Vestey, the offer to pay 273 million bolivars made by
Minister Loyo more than a year before Agroflora’s recovery cannot be deemed an
offer to compensate the expropriation.'%° In any event, that offer did not meet the
criteria of effectiveness and adequacy.

Effectiveness entails that compensation be paid in freely convertible currency. 1%!
Even if Article 5 were read not to require compensation in freely transferable currency,
the Claimant contends that it is entitled to invoke the relevant provisions of other
treaties by virtue of the MFN clause of the BIT. The Claimant specifically refers to
Article 5 of the investment treaty concluded by Venezuela with the Czech Republic,
which requires compensation to be "effectively realizable and be made freely
transferrable in a freely convertible currency". 192

The Claimant recalls that the MOA made its final offer in bolivars, leaving the risk of
the currency conversion to Vestey. The only possible conversion was through CADIVI,
which "rarely authorized access to foreign currency and had effectively stopped
providing US Dollars to private applicants by the end of 2008".1%° In addition, officials
of CADIVI had informed Ms. dos Santos that neither Agroflora nor Vestey were
authorized to obtain US dollars. In other words, the price in local currency "would have
been neither freely transferable nor freely convertible". 1%

In any event, the price offered during the sales negotiations was inadequate. The offer
was far below the value assigned to Agroflora by the Claimant's expert. It also failed
to ascribe any value to Agroflora’s land — which alone was worth USD 40.8 million.
The fact that Vestey was prepared to accept Venezuela's offer if paid in US dollars
does not make the offer adequate, since Vestey’s acceptance "represented a
compromise, proffered in view of the relentless political pressure applied by
Venezuela [...]."195

Venezuela also failed to pay the compensation promptly. Almost five years after the
recovery, no payment has yet been made. The Claimant opposes the Respondent's
argument that compensation may be paid even as late as five years after the taking.
Relying on the authorities cited by the Respondent, the Claimant contends that the
normal time for a payment of compensation is between three and six months and, in
exceptional circumstances if the payment is made in installments, it should in any
event not exceed five years, taking into account interest accrued on the deferred
installments. '° Venezuela faced no exceptional circumstances. It did pay much larger
settlement and compensation amounts to other foreign investors, thereby evidencing
that it had sufficient foreign currency reserves.'87 Even assuming extraordinary
circumstances quod non, Venezuela did not offer alternative arrangements, such as
the payment in installments.

iv. Discrimination

The Claimant also submits that the expropriation of Agroflora was discriminatory. In
reliance on the Saluka test, also invoked by the Respondent, the Claimant observes
that "a claim for discrimination would be made out where (a) similar cases, (b) are
treated differently, (c) without reasonable justification".'°® The Claimant points to
instances where Venezuela paid a purchase price or expropriation compensation in
convertible currency to foreign investors, including in the food sector.'®° By refusing
to make a payment in US dollars for Agroflora, Venezuela treated Vestey differently
from these other foreign investors in like circumstances.

The Claimant concludes that "Venezuela unlawfully expropriated Agroflora by seizing
all of its assets (including its land, to which it had valid legal title) and control of its
operations, in a manner that failed to meet each and every requirement of Article 5 of
the Treaty."20°

The Respondent submits that the right to take private property for a public purpose is
"one of the essential elements of State sovereignty"*°' which entails "a presumption
of legitimacy [of expropriation], which needs to be proven wrong".202

For Venezuela, the allegedly expropriated land was in reality state property recovered
in accordance with the Land Law, being specified that the requirement of continuous
chain of title existed for decades.*°° Vestey having failed to demonstrate its title over
the land, the Respondent ordered the recovery of Agroflora “for reasons of social
interest and public utility pursuant to Article 84 of the Land Law’. Venezuela also
took control of the non-land assets of Agroflora "based on a court interim order issued
under Article 196 of the Land Law", as a "fully appropriate means for obtaining timely
control of such assets without disrupting the agrarian production".2°5

The Respondent in particular calls attention to the decision of the Supreme Court
which held that the interim measures did not affect Agroflora's ownership title over its
non-land assets.7°° Venezuela thus considers that, if it were ordered to compensate
the Claimant, it would be entitled to ownership over these assets. In any event, the
Respondent finds the distinction drawn between land and non-land assets artificial,
as "the Republic's actions may only be judged against the standard set forth in Article
5(1) of the Treaty".2°7 The Respondent contends that it has complied with this
standard, as the recovery pursued a public purpose (i); respected due process of law
(ii); was accompanied by a good faith attempt to compensate Vestey (iii); and was
non-discriminatory (iv).

i. Public purpose

The Respondent maintains that it "is not required to justify the public policy rationale
for which it decided to recover [Agroflora]" as "a State is ‘entitled to a measure of
deference’ in defining the public interest".°° It is not open to the Tribunal to call into
question Venezuela’s economic policies. Each state, so says the Respondent, is "free
to judge for itself what it considers useful or necessary for the public good".2%9

Contrary to the Claimant's argument, such deference does not render the BIT's
requirement of public purpose meaningless. The Respondent adds that none of the
authorities relied upon by the Claimant suggests "second-guess[ing] the sovereign
determination of the public purpose".?"° In particular, “the strategic interest invoked by
Hungary in ADC was a mere pretense.” In the present case, the "recovery occurred
in implementation of genuine, proven public policy objectives that the Republic has
championed for many years".211

The Respondent goes on to argue that it "recovered Agroflora as part of its
overarching plan to ensure sovereign control over the domestic production of food".?!2
This purpose is clearly stated in all the recovery notices, which refer to the "/djesarollo
[rural [ijntegral."*'? The Respondent rejects the Claimant's allegation that food
security would have equally, if not better, been achieved, if it had continued to run
Agroflora. In any event, to Venezuela, "it is not for Vestey to judge how the Republic
should best achieve its public policy objectives".*'4 Moreover, notes the Respondent,
Vestey has not shown that the recovery of Agroflora was driven by other political
motives.

ii. Due process

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that Article 5 of the BIT provides for
due process. For it, Article 5(1) of the BIT only envisages a right to have the measure
reviewed.?'5 In line with this right, Venezuelan law established a mechanism of
administrative and judicial review of recovery decisions. The Claimant made use of
this mechanism by challenging the recovery notices and the interim measures before
the Superior Agrarian Court. The Respondent further rejects the Claimant’s
contention that the Expropriation Law should have applied to the recovery process.
According to Venezuela, the recovery was rightly conducted under the Land Law,
which sets out a special legal regime for the recovery of agricultural land.

The Respondent submits that a breach of domestic procedures does not necessarily
constitute a violation of due process. Accordingly, it is irrelevant that the Claimant
asserts that "the INTI provisional measures did not establish the exact time during

which they could take effect and did not expressly state that they protect the right of
permanent residents of squatters [...]".2’° Similarly, the Claimant's allegation that the
provisional measures did not refer to the legal basis for the recovery of the non-land
assets is a matter of domestic law and has no bearing on the due process requirement
under the Treaty. In the same vein, the Claimant's allegation that it received no formal
notice of the interim measures lacks relevance for purposes of the Treaty application.

Furthermore, according to Venezuela, it is disingenuous for the Claimant to argue that
Venezuela's alleged failure to notify the final recovery decisions prevented a timely
appeal. It also rejects Vestey’s allegation that its appeal from the order for interim
measures has never been decided and submits a decision of the Supreme Court
dated 13 August 2013 by which such court dismissed the appeal.?'”

On this basis, the Respondent maintains that Vestey has failed to demonstrate that
the recovery of the Farms violated the due process requirement under the BIT.

iii. Compensation

It is the Respondent's submission that the non-payment of compensation does not
make the expropriation unlawful per se. Indeed, when the terms of the compensation
are disputed, the duty to pay does not arise since it is yet to be determined what
specific compensation is due.2"8

Moreover, the requirement that compensation be prompt does not imply that it be
immediate, but merely calls for payment as soon as possible.*'9 Even accepting the
period of three to six months suggested by the Claimant, this requirement would not
be breached here. Indeed, only about two months elapsed from the beginning of the
recovery until the initiation of this arbitration. The time since the start of the arbitration
cannot be taken into account, as it precisely serves to set the amount of the
compensation.?2°

In any event, the Republic offered compensation to Vestey both before and after the
recovery. Minister Loyo offered to purchase Agroflora for 273 million bolivars.22' This
amount, so says the Respondent, was convertible into US dollars in Venezuela

through a legally established method of conversion. In particular, the Claimant could
have sought the conversion of the purchase price through CADIVI. In such a case, it
would have obtained USD 63.5 million at the rate of 1 US dollar for 4.3 bolivars.

Contrary to the Claimant's allegation, this compensation offer, which the Claimant first
accepted and then later refused, qualifies as compensation offer under the Treaty.222
The offer was also more than adequate, as it was higher than the market value
ascribed to Agroflora by Econ One, the Respondent's damage expert in these
proceedings whose valuation amounts to USD 45.8 million. This offer was made in
local currency in good faith and Venezuela agreed in Clause 3 of the draft 2010
agreement? that it would assist in expediting the conversion process with CADIVI.?24
The fact that the offers were made in bolivars does not make them inadequate as it
was the Claimant's refusal to pursue negotiations that prevented further discussions
on currency.?5 In the Respondent's view, Vestey was acting unreasonably when it
turned down this offer.

The Respondent also submits that it repeated its compensation offer after the
recovery. As Minister Loyo's testified, he personally called Ms. dos Santos to offer a
payment during the second week of November 2011.26 Vestey can thus not blame
Venezuela now for not having received compensation.?2”

iv. Discrimination

The Respondent observes that the Parties concur on the definition of discriminatory
conduct as it was established in Saluka, i.e. a claim for discrimination would be made
out where (a) similar cases (b) are treated differently (c) without reasonable
justification. On this basis, it submits that the fact that it may have paid a purchase
price or expropriation compensation in foreign currency to other foreign investors is
irrelevant for four reasons.

First, the duty of non-discrimination does not extend to compensation. Rather, as
Article 5 of the BIT makes clear, it applies only to the taking itself. Second, the
payments made in other cases where there was an agreement on the amount are of
no relevance, since unlike there Vestey and Venezuela failed to reach an agreement

on the amount due. Third, none of the enterprises compensated in foreign currency
operated in the farming industry. Only one of them, namely the supermarket chain
Cativen, was in the food business. In any event, the government compensated
Cativen because, contrary to Vestey, it pursued the negotiations with the government.
Fourth, unlawful discrimination implies an intent, which is lacking here because the
Republic's actions did not consider the nationality of the persons involved. Venezuela
recovered food businesses held by foreigners and Venezuelans alike.?7°

Therefore, Venezuela’s recovery of Agroflora was in conformity with all the
requirements of Article 5 of the BIT.229

c. Analysis
The relevant part of Article 5(1) of the BIT reads as follows:

“Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be
nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to
nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”) in the
territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose related to the
internal needs of the Party, on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt,
adequate and effective compensation.”

The Tribunal will start by determining whether there has been an expropriation. In the

affirmative, it will then examine whether the expropriation was lawful. In this context,

it notes that the Parties do not dispute that the criteria for the legality of the

expropriation enshrined in Article 5(1) of the BIT are cumulative.

i. Act of expropriation

It is common ground between the Parties that Venezuela took over the control of
Agroflora’s administration and assets. The Respondent contends, however, that
Vestey did not own the land of its Farms and that, therefore, it simply recovered public
land for which it owes no compensation.?°°

To determine whether Venezuela’s taking of Agroflora’s land constitutes an
expropriation, the Tribunal must assess whether Vestey held a title to the land. The
Parties agree that Venezuelan law governs ownership of the land. They disagree,

228 R-Rejoinder, 1363-366.
229 R-Rejoinder, 9367.
230 R-PHB1, § IV.A.1.a.

60

253.

254.

however, on whether the Land Law, being one of the contested measures, must be
taken into account when reviewing ownership.

As was described above, the present dispute arose when Venezuela introduced
certain measures under the Land Law, starting with the adoption of the 2001 Land
Law itself and culminating in the recovery proceedings in 2011.7°1 The Land Law is
the very measure that Vestey is challenging before this Tribunal as one of the
expropriatory acts which deprived it of its investment.*°? The Parties are in agreement
that an investor's ownership over the allegedly affected assets must be assessed
immediately before the adoption of the challenged measures.**° Accordingly, the
Tribunal will review the validity of Vestey’s title just before the introduction of the Land
Law, i.e. as of 13 November 2001.

Using a later date would render the protection granted in Article 5 of the BIT illusory.
If one were to set the date of assessment of the investor’s ownership any later than
the date of the first contested measure, a state could adopt a law making it impossible
for a private owner to prove ownership and thereby circumvent the Treaty guarantee.
This cannot be the meaning of the Treaty.?*4 Therefore, the Tribunal will not consider
the provisions of the Land Law in assessing Vestey’s ownership over the allegedly
expropriated land.

The Claimant contends that, in light of the Republic’s previous recognition of Vestey’s
title in particular through the 2006 Agreement and the productivity certificates, the
Respondent is estopped from challenging Vestey’s land ownership. For the event that
Venezuela is not so estopped, Vestey claims that its ownership is proven by the
existence of a registered title. The Respondent, on the other hand, submits that the
Claimant must establish the historic chain of valid title transfers to the land and that it
failed to do so. The Parties further diverge on whether Vestey acquired title by
acquisitive prescription. Each of these matters will be dealt with in turn.

a) Estoppel and recognition of title through productivity certificates and other
governmental acts

231 The alleged events before the enactment of the 2001 Land Law, i.e., the squatters’ invasions at Hato
El Charcote no longer form the basis of the claims, The Claimant's Reply to Venezuela's Request
for Bifurcation, 15 March 2013, 99. Therefore, the 2001 Land Law is chronologically the first measure
giving rise to the claims.

282 C-Rejoinder, 9935, 36.

233 R-Opening, slide 64.

234 This would also go against the cornerstone rule of international law, according to which "the
characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful [...] is not affected by the
characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law." Article 3, ILC Articles on State
Responsibility, Exh. CLA-19.

61

256.

257.

258.

259.

In support of its argument of estoppel, the Claimant first submits that, pursuant to
Article 8.2 of the 2006 Agreement, the government recognized its title when issuing
the productivity certificates to Agroflora. It also invokes the fact that the government
did not challenge its peaceful possession of the land for decades.

The Tribunal is not convinced by these arguments. The requirements for acquiring
property rights over immovable assets situated in Venezuela are governed by specific
norms of Venezuelan property law. For a private person to have a claim under
international law arising from the deprivation of its property, it must hold that property
in accordance with applicable rules of domestic law. The principle of estoppel cannot
create otherwise inexistent property rights. This is so if one grounds the principle of

estoppel on international law.

It is equally so if one seeks to find a basis for estoppel in domestic law. Indeed,
Venezuelan law leaves no room for the acquisition of property by estoppel.
Specifically, Article 796 of the Civil Code provides that property rights can be acquired
by the following means:
“Property and other rights can be acquired and transferred by virtue of the law, by
succession, and by contract. They can be also acquired through prescription.”?5>
These means do not include estoppel. One of them, acquisitive prescription, could be
compared to estoppel in the sense that it implies that acquiescence to peaceful
possession can create property rights. The creation of property rights through
acquisitive prescription is, however, subject to stringent legal conditions.

Putting aside the estoppel argument which cannot succeed here, the Tribunal notes
that the governmental acts on which Vestey relies are incapable of creating or
transferring property rights under Article 796 of the Civil Code. In particular, the 2006
Agreement did not contemplate selling or otherwise transferring the property over the
land. Nor could the productivity certificates issued pursuant to the 2006 Agreement
accomplish that end. A productivity certificate, which is only valid for two years, merely
certifies the productivity of the land.?6

Ley, por sucesién, por efecto de los contratos. Pueden también adquirirse por medio de la
prescripcion.” Article 796, Civil Code of Venezuela, Exh. C-366.

62

261.

262.

265.

266.

Finally, Venezuela’s lack of challenge of Vestey’s possession could only create rights
if the conditions for acquisitive prescription were fulfilled, a question that the Tribunal
will review later in this analysis.

b) Registered title

The Parties disagree on the value of a registered title under Venezuelan law. For the
Claimant, a registered title evidences sufficient ownership title unless it is invalidated
by a final decision of the competent Venezuelan court. By contrast, the Respondent
argues that a registered title shows “just title” (“justo titulo”).

Article 27 of the Law on Public Registries provides that the entries into public registries
qualify as public documents:
“Registry entries and information contained and officially issued from the registrar
system shall have all legal effects pertaining to public documents.”
It is common ground between the Parties that the registry extracts presented by the
Claimant have been issued by the Public Registry. Hence, they constitute public
documents within the meaning of the Law on Public Registries.

Pursuant to Article 1359 of the Civil Code, a public document is presumed valid. Such
provision reads in pertinent part as follows:

“A public instrument carries faith, both as between the parties and as to the third
parties, so long as it is not declared false [...].’?98

As Brewer-Carias writes, a public document “does not only serve the purpose of
informing of the occurrence of the registration, [but] it [also] constitutes public faith
and, therefore, should be taken as valid unless otherwise proven in court [...].”°° The

287 Claimant's translation, in Spanish: “Los asientos e informaciones registrales contenidos y emanados
oficialmente del sistema registral, surtiran todos los efectos juridicos que corresponden a los
documentos publicos”, Article 27, Law on Public Registries, Exh. C-253.1.

Respondent accepts that the registration creates a rebuttable presumption, i.e.
presumption juris tantum, of validity of the registered act.24°

However, as the Respondent asserts, it is not the act of the registration which gives
rise to the transfer of property. Indeed, Article 796 of the Civil Code, which contains
an exhaustive list of the modes of transfer or creation of a property right, does not list
registration as an independent method of acquisition of property rights. By contrast,
that provision does list contracts as self-standing means of transferring property.24'
Venezuela acknowledged this in the following terms:

“In the moment when there is a consent about — the asset sold and the price, the

property is transferred automatically.” 74?
Accordingly, although registration is not an independent mode of acquisition of
property, it is not disputed that it creates a presumption that the act underlying the
registration is valid. In the present case, that underlying act is the contract for the
transfer of property. Such contract does constitute an independent mode of
acquisition of a property right, a matter that is uncontroversial. Unless it is invalidated
through the means established by law, the registration obliges any third party,
including this Tribunal, to presume that the property right has been validly transferred
by operation of the registered property transfer agreement.

That conclusion is in line with the overarching legislative objective of legal certainty in
property transactions. Or in the words of the Venezuelan legislators:

“The mission of the registry is to guarantee the legal certainty of the registered acts
and rights vis a vis third persons, through the publicity of the registry.”°#

If the registered title were to account solely for the good faith intention of the acquirer
of the property it would not produce any legal consequences for third parties and
registry entries would not need to be public. These entries are public precisely
because they create the presumption of validity of a registered legal act vis a vis the

entire public. Therefore, any third person can and must presume that legal acts
entered into the Public Registry are valid.

The Public Registry may of course contain invalid or inaccurate data. The fact of
registration does not validate an otherwise invalid legal act; it merely creates a
rebuttable presumption that the act is valid.244 That presumption can only be
overcome by a final judicial decision. Article 43 of the Law on Public Registries sets
forth the method of impeaching the validity of a registered legal act in the following
terms:

“[R]egistry entries where a void or voidable legal act is recorded may only be annulled

pursuant to a final judgment not subject to appeal.”45
Consequently, the validity of a registered act is not self-judging. Third persons, such
as the government or this Tribunal, cannot judge for themselves whether a registered
legal act is valid or not. They must presume the validity of the act until and unless the
contrary is established by the competent Venezuelan court. In the absence of a
judicial decision to the contrary, the Tribunal will thus consider that the registered
property transfer agreements presented by Vestey validly transferred the property
rights over the land plots.

The Respondent further objects that the areas indicated in the registered titles do not
coincide with the areas claimed by Vestey. The Claimant answers that the
discrepancies are due to the fact that the old registered titles did not employ modern
measurement techniques.

In the Tribunals view, these discrepancies do not per se affect the validity or existence
of the registered titles. Venezuelan law does not provide for such a consequence. If
the Respondent deemed the registered titles invalid as a result of these errors, it could
have initiated the judicial action provided in Article 43 of the Law on Public Registries.
Yet, it is undisputed that the government never started any legal proceedings to
invalidate Vestey’s registered title.

The outcome could have been different if the registry extracts made reference to land
plots different from those claimed by the Claimant. However, in this instance, the
physical defining features and names of the registered plots coincide with those

claimed by Vestey. The divergences merely involve the precise surfaces of the land
registered in Agroflora’s name. The actual surface at issue may be relevant for
valuation purposes, but it has no bearing on the existence or validity of a registered
title. On this basis, the Tribunal’s conclusion that Agroflora validly acquired title over
the land applies to the surface areas stated in the registry extracts.

c) Acquisitive prescription

In any event, even if the registrations were not deemed to confer valid title, Vestey
would hold such title on the ground of acquisitive prescription.

Indeed, where the property transfer agreement is invalid (for instance, because, the
seller did not own the asset), ownership may be acquired through prescription, which
is an independent mode of acquisition of a property right. As Article 796 of the Civil
Code stipulates, “[t]he property and other rights can be acquired [...] through
prescription.”*4° Article 1952 of the Civil Code further clarifies that “prescription is a
mode of acquisition of a right [...].”247

Article 1979 of the Civil Code provides a specific rule for the acquisition of property
rights through prescription:

“One who acquires an immovable good or a property right over an immovable good

in good faith through a duly registered title not invalid for a defect in form, acquires

the ownership or the property right within ten years from the date of the registration

of the title.”248
The Respondent does not dispute that Vestey acted in good faith when it acquired
registered title over the land. Nor does it challenge the formal validity of the
registration. It arises from the record that Vestey completed the registration in respect
of its last acquisition of contested land in 1988, namely more than ten years before
the present dispute arose. The requirements for an acquisitive prescription provided
in Article 1979 of the Civil Code are thus met.

Id., Article 1979.

283.

The Respondent opposes that the prescriptive acquisition of a property right requires
a declaration from the Venezuelan courts. In support, it relies on Article 690 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, which stipulates as follows:

“For claiming the declaration of the property through acquisitive prescription or the
declaration of any other right susceptible of acquisitive prescription, the interested
person must present a formal demand before a First Instance Civil Judge of the
location of the real estate, which will substantiate and resolve in accordance with rules
set forth in this Chapter.”?49
The wording of this provision is straightforward. It sets forth a procedural framework
for a declaration of acquisitive prescription and not for the acquisitive prescription
itself. Nothing in this article suggests that the declaration is a prerequisite for the
acquisition of a property right through prescription. Article 796 of the Civil Code is
clear in that “[t]he property and other rights can be acquired [...] through prescription”.
It does not require a declaration of prescription. The property right is acquired once
the substantive requirements for this particular mode of acquisition are satisfied, as
they are set forth in Article 1979 of the Civil Code.

Article 691 of the Code of Civil Procedure confirms that a judicial declaration is not a
condition for the acquisition of rights by prescription:

“The request [for the declaration of acquisitive prescription] shall be presented against
all those persons who appear in the respective Registry Office as owners or holders
of the title over any property right over the real estate. The request shall be
accompanied with a certificate from the Registry in which the name, surname and
domicile of such persons will be indicated, and with a certified copy of the respective
title.’25°
If a judicial declaration under Article 691 of the Code of Civil Procedure were a pre-
requisite of acquisitive prescription, Article 1979 of the Civil Code would be rendered
inutile, since the registered owner would never be able to initiate declaratory
proceedings against oneself. The only understanding that reconciles these two

provisions is that one acquires a property right once it meets the substantive

249 Tribunal's translation; in Spanish: “Cuando se pretenda la declaraci6n de propiedad por prescripcién
adquisitiva segun la ley, o la declaracién de cualquier otro derecho real susceptible de prescripcién

el presente Capitulo.” Article 690, Code of Civil Procedure, Exh. R-91, emphasis added.

proponerse contra todas aquellas personas que aparezcan en la respectiva Oficina de Registro

tales personas, y copia certificada del titulo respectivo." Article 691, Code of Civil Procedure, Exh.

requirements prescribed in Article 1979, while the rules of the Code of Civil Procedure
provide a legal process to formally declare that acquisition has validly occurred.

Venezuela also argues that Vestey is estopped from invoking acquisition by
prescription as it did not raise this defense at the time of the recovery proceedings.”>'
In fact, Vestey relied on acquisitive prescription seeking to annul INTI’s resolution
effecting the recovery of El Charcote in judicial proceedings in 2005. The court
dismissed the argument as procedurally inapposite.?5? In any event, the Tribunal can
discern no requirement in the applicable legal framework according to which the
beneficiary of an acquisitive prescription must invoke the prescription before any court
or authority or otherwise inform third parties. Therefore, even if Vestey had never
invoked the acquisitive prescription it would not change the legal position, i.e. that it
had acquired ownership in accordance with Article 1979 of the Civil Code.

d) Chain of title

The Tribunal has already established that Vestey held title to the land at the time of
the impugned measures. Venezuela’s takeover of Agroflora and its land constitutes
an expropriation. For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal will nevertheless address
the Respondent's central argument about the chain of title.

The Respondent argues that, in order to demonstrate the sufficient ownership title
over land, one must prove that the person from whom the land was acquired held him
-or herself sufficient title. Accordingly, for Venezuela, proof of ownership involves
establishing the validity of all the title transfers from the first release of the property
into the private ownership. This requirement hinges on the principle that no one can
transfer more rights than he or she holds - nemo plus iuris transferre potest quam ipse
habet. The Respondent particularly relies on the 1936 Vacant Land Law to assert that
the purported private owner of the land bears the burden to prove ownership by
demonstrating the chain of title.2°° The Claimant disagrees, arguing that the 1936
Vacant Land Law does not require private owners to establish their title by proving
the chain of title. It submits that there was no legal basis for the chain of title
requirement in Venezuelan law until it was introduced by the challenged Land Law.

251 R-PHB1, 9989, 90.

252 Decision of the Superior Agrarian Court, 28 September 2005, Exh. C-114, p.19.

253 The Respondent also relies on the 2010 Land Law. However, as it has been established above, the
relevant date for assessing the ownership is the date when the first complained measure gave rise
to the dispute. The 2010 Land Law itself constitutes one of the challenged measures. Therefore, it
will not be taken into account when examining Vestey’s title over the land.

68

287.

288.

The Tribunal notes that the principle that no one can convey more rights than he or
she holds implies that a defect in the chain of title affects all subsequent transactions.
Most domestic property laws balance this principle against the interest of a good faith
buyer and legal certainty in property transactions. Instead of imposing the burden of
proving the chain of title, those laws offer more easily ascertainable ways of
establishing ownership. These include in particular the presumption of validity of
registered titles**4, acquisitive prescription,2> and the protection notion of the bona
fide purchaser.

Under Venezuelan property law, the presumption of validity of registered titles, as well
as the institution of acquisitive prescription allow owners to establish their ownership
without investigating the chain of title. The Venezuelan legislators have also made
sure that a private person will only be burdened to prove its ownership title in a limited
number of cases. The Parties are in agreement that the general rule on distribution of
burden of proof under Venezuelan law requires that a person who brings an action
against the purported private owner disprove the ownership.”¢ This allocation can
only be reversed in exceptional circumstances. In particular, in a case invoked by the
Respondent, the Supreme Court of Venezuela noted that “the regular principle on the
allocation of the burden of proof does not apply to the vindication of the vacant land”
by the government in accordance with the 1936 Vacant Land Law.?” According to the
court, the reversal of the burden of proof in favor of the state derives from Article 1 of
the 1936 Vacant Land Law:

“[l]t suffices that the State attempt to vindicate the particular land because it considers

it vacant, for the respondent [i.e. the private owner] to bear the burden of proving

ownership over the claimed land [...]’?5°
Nowhere did the court hold that there is a general reversal of the burden of proof in
favor of the state in all types of ownership disputes between a private person and the
state. Rather, according to the court, the burden will be reversed if the state “attempts
to vindicate” allegedly vacant land. The rules on the vindication of vacant land are
prescribed by Article 10 of the 1936 Vacant Land Law, which provides as follows:

254 See, e.g., Section 58, English Land Registration Act 2002.

255 See, e.g., Article 2265, Civil Code of France.

“In case the vacant land appear to be unlawfully occupied as a private property, the

Federal Executive shall arrange to initiate the civil action before the competent courts,

in conformity with the present Law.”7°9
The Parties do not dispute that the government of Venezuela has never initiated a
vindication action against Vestey seeking a declaration that the Farms were vacant
pursuant to Article 10 of the 1936 Vacant Land Law. Consequently, the reversal of
the burden of proof provided by Article 1 of the 1936 Vacant Land Law and invoked
by the Respondent does not apply by its own terms. Hence, even if the 1936 Vacant
Land Law were deemed to oblige Vestey to show the chain of title, quod non, that
obligation was never been triggered by the government.?©°

Furthermore, Article 11 of the 1936 Vacant Land Law provides for limitations to civil
vindication actions instituted by the state under Article 10. Article 11 bars the state
from initiating such action altogether “when there is evidence that, if invoked, the
defense of acquisitive prescription will be successful”.**' Article 11 further authorizes
the private person whose ownership is challenged to invoke acquisitive prescription
as a defense during the vindication action under Article 10. Hence, even if the
government had started a vindication action, Article 11 would have allowed Vestey to
prove its ownership by claiming acquisitive prescription as a defense without the need
to show chain of title.

On the basis of this analysis, it is clear that Respondent has never placed Vestey in
a procedural setting in which Venezuelan law would have required to show the chain
of title. In conclusion, by the time of the measures, Vestey had acquired the full
ownership title over the contested land. Therefore, the government's takeover of
control over Agroflora’s property and administration constitutes an expropriation
within the meaning of Article 5 of the BIT.

ii. Public purpose

Article 5 of the BIT requires that an expropriation be “for a public purpose related to
the internal needs of the Party”. The Respondent accepts that "[p]ursuant to Article 5

259 Tribunal's translation; Article 10, 1936 Vacant Land Law, Exh. R-3.

260 The additional case law invoked by the Respondent further supports such interpretation of the burden
of proving the chain of title. In particular, the 1997 decision of the Superior Agrarian Court established
that a person bringing the vindictive action bears the burden of proving the chain of title. Exh. RLA-

the [state's] actions must be for a declared public purpose".? In other words, there
must be a public purpose and the measure must be aimed at achieving that purpose.

The Tribunal must thus first assess whether there existed a public purpose. It concurs
with the Respondent that for purposes of this assessment states deserve broad
deference.*5 In the words of the LIAMCO tribunal, the state is “free to judge for itself
what it considers useful or necessary for the public good”. International tribunals
should thus accept the policies determined by the state for the common good, except
in situations of blatant misuse of the power to set public policies.

Here, the Respondent submits that its purpose was “to ensure the availability and
timely access to food by its citizens, as part of its national plan to ensure food self-
sufficiency”. It also submits that “the widespread access to agricultural and livestock
resources [...] make[s] up one of the main drivers of the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela's food strategy to provide resources to its population”.2°° The Tribunal
defers to this policy determination. In any event, that policy appears perfectly
legitimate and worth of protection and there is no suggestion in the record that it was
not.

This finding, however, does not end the inquiry. The Tribunal must also assess
whether the impugned expropriatory measure was “for” the public purpose as Article
5(1) of the BIT requires. In doing so, it must consider all the relevant circumstances,
including the government's post-expropriation conduct.?6” While the objective is not
to review the effectiveness of the measures, the government's failure to advance a
declared purpose may serve as evidence that the measure was not taken in
furtherance of such purpose. Thus, the idea is to determine whether the measure had
a reasonable nexus with the declared public purpose or in other words, was at least
capable of furthering that purpose.

While it argues that the purpose of Agroflora’s take over was to secure the
population’s access to food, the Respondent has accepted on multiple occasions that
Agroflora was a very productive enterprise.?© It is also undisputed that the entire beef

output of Agroflora was sold on the domestic market at the regulated price. During the
hearing, the Respondent’s expert testified that the Venezuelan government imports
cattle from abroad at higher prices than the domestic ones and then uses a budgetary
subsidy to domestically resell the imported cattle at the lower domestic price.?6° In
such circumstances, a productive private farming enterprise selling the entirety of its
beef output on the domestic market at regulated prices contributes to the
implementation of the state’s access to food policy. It in fact shares the burden of
meeting the alimentary needs of the population. It is difficult to see how the purpose
of wider access to food would be better served by expropriating such private
enterprise. Nothing in the record suggests that Agroflora’s output increased after the
expropriation, or that the population gained wider or cheaper access to the beef
produced by Agroflora. To the contrary, there are unrebutted statements of the
Claimant’s witnesses that the government's management of Agroflora resulted in a
decline of the production levels.2”°

Another justification advanced by Venezuela for the takeover of Agroflora was the
need to guarantee wider public access to Vestey’s genetically superior cattle. The fact
shows, however, that Vestey regularly sold its purebred cattle and semen of high
genetic quality to local producers.?”' There is no evidence that after the expropriation
the government increased the purebred cattle sales or decreased its sales price. To
the contrary, the record suggests that under the government's control Agroflora sold
purebred cattle at higher than regulated prices.*’? In any event, if the government
indeed aimed at wider public access to Agroflora’s purebred cattle, measures lighter
than expropriation were available. The government could for instance have adopted
a regulation obliging Agroflora to increase the sales of purebred cattle or semen
and/or to lower the prices.

The Respondent also argued that its aim to facilitate public access to food warranted
the redistribution to the people of the large uncultivated land plots in private hands
(latifundios). This justification can hardly apply here, where the government clearly
acknowledged that Agroflora was a productive enterprise. At the hearing, the
Respondent's expert testified that there was no “higher and better” use for Agroflora’s
land than that practiced by Agroflora.2’° In any event, there is no evidence that the

government distributed the ownership to the land to private persons or had any plans
to this effect.

On this basis, the least that the Tribunal can say is that the nexus between
Venezuela’s declared purpose to achieve wider public access to food and the
expropriation of Agroflora is not obvious. That being so, the Tribunal can dispense
with a definitive ruling on this requirement in light of the conclusion reached in the
following section.

iii, Due process

It is a common ground between the Parties that Article 5(1) of the BIT guarantees an
opportunity for an investor “to prompt review, by a judicial or other independent
authority, of his or its case”.2”* That guarantee also applies to an independent review
of the “valuation of his or its investment”.

The Parties are also in agreement that Venezuela did not regard its measures as
expropriation within the meaning of Venezuelan law. It took control of Agroflora under
the legal regime of rescate provided in the Land Law.?”> Indeed, when Vestey
appealed the interim measures issued against Agroflora under the Land Law, the
Supreme Court denied the application of the guarantees enshrined in the
Expropriation Law, because this was not the relevant framework:

“(W]e are not within the framework of an expropriation proceeding, but rather in the

implementation of measures intended to ensure agro-food security and sovereignty
of the Venezuelan people."276

Venezuela's Expropriation Law provides detailed procedural guarantees. It requires
that compensation for expropriation be determined by a commission of three experts,
and requires the state to initiate a judicial action to expropriate an asset.?”” This legal
regime differs drastically from that of the Land Law. The rescate proceedings under
the Land Law are based on the premise that the land is state property and, therefore,
the state owes no compensation to the persons from whom the land is recovered. It
goes even further by denying the right to compensation for any improvements found
on the recovered land:

"The persons illegally occupying the public land, which is susceptible of recovery,
cannot claim any indemnity for any improvement or fruits present at the occupied
In 2002, the Constitutional Court of Venezuela struck down this latter provision as
unconstitutional.” However, in 2005, the Parliament reintroduced the same provision
in Article 86 of the Land Law.?® Similarly, the Land Law contains no rules for the
compensation for the movable property, such as cattle or vehicles, seized with the
recovered land.

By introducing and applying the Land Law to Vestey’s investment and thereby
derogating from the procedural guarantees of the Expropriation Law, Venezuela
deprived Vestey not only of the opportunity to have the valuation of its investment
reviewed by an independent authority, but of the right to be compensated altogether.
The regime provided by the Land Law fails to satisfy the due process requirements of
the BIT.

Furthermore, Venezuela failed to comply procedural regime of the Land Law itself, as
rudimentary as it is. Namely, Article 93 of the Land Law provides that the rescate
proceedings are concluded by INTI’s final recovery decision. Article 94 of the same
law stipulates that such final recovery decision must be notified to the occupant of the
land and the latter then has 60 days to appeal that decision.?8"

INTI issued the final recovery decisions for the Farms on 19 December 2011.78
Venezuela filed these decisions as Exhibit R-66 to its Counter-Memorial, on
12 August 2013, over a year after the decisions were handed down. The Claimant
complained that it then learned of these decisions for the first time.?®° The Respondent
neither alleges nor provides for that the decisions were conveyed to the Claimant
earlier. The Tribunal thus concludes that Venezuela failed to communicate the final
recovery decisions to Vestey as required by Article 94 of the Land Law, thereby
depriving Vestey of the opportunity to appeal the decisions before a judicial
authority. This conduct breached the guarantee of a prompt review by an
independent authority enshrined in Article 5(1) of the BIT.

Moreover, Vestey also learned of the outcome of its appeal from the interim measures
through this arbitration. The Respondent filed the Supreme Court decision as Exhibit
R-115 to its Rejoinder of 13 October 2014. There is no allegation or evidence of an
earlier communication of the decision dated from 13 August 2013. This procedural
omission further infringed on Vestey’s treaty right of independent review.

It flows from the foregoing discussion that the limited procedural guarantees existing
under the rescate regime of the Land Law were insufficient to comply with the Treaty’s
due process requirement and that Venezuela’s repeated failures to notify Vestey of
its decisions breached even the limited procedural guarantees available under the
Land Law. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot but find that Venezuela’s expropriation of
Vestey’s investment was not in accordance with the procedural guarantees of Article
5(1) of the BIT. This determination suffices to conclude that the expropriation is
unlawful. The Tribunal could thus dispense with the analysis of the remaining criteria
of a lawful expropriation under Article 5(1) of the BIT, i.e. discrimination and
compensation. Because of the particular facts of the case involving sales negotiations
first and recovery proceedings later, which the Parties have extensively briefed, the
Tribunal will nevertheless briefly address compensation.

iv. Compensation

The Respondent does not dispute that it paid no compensation to Vestey, but insists
that it offered to do so. Whether compensation was offered would be relevant if the
Tribunal were to assess the lawfulness of the expropriation. However, the Tribunal
has already found that the expropriation was unlawful because it failed to comply with
at least one other cumulative requirement of legality. This finding could end the inquiry
under Article 5 of the BIT. However, as stated above, the Tribunal will nevertheless
briefly discuss the requirement of compensation for the sake of completeness.

The Respondent submits that its offer for a purchase price during the sale and
purchase negotiations of Agroflora must be considered as a compensation offer for
expropriation purposes. In particular, it refers to the term sheet signed by
Mr. Edelmann on 5 March 201078 and to the draft sale and purchase agreement of
25 November 2010.78

285 Exh. C-152.

314.

The Tribunal is not convinced that an offer to pay a price to buy a company can be
assimilated to an offer to compensate for the expropriation. Article 5(1) of the BIT
requires the expropriation to be “against prompt, adequate and effective
compensation.” The sales negotiations took place over one year prior to the rescate.
One can hardly see how a price offer made in that context could relate to
compensation for the expropriation. The fact that the sales negotiations failed, for
whatever reason, did not release Venezuela from its obligation under Article 5(1) of
the BIT to provide compensation for expropriation.

Notably, throughout the sales negotiations, the government offered to pay a purchase
price, without ever making reference to an expropriation. The present facts differ from
the circumstances of Mobil and ConocoPhilips which the Respondent invokes. In
Mobil, there was evidence of “discussions [that] took place in 2007 between the
Parties on the compensation that was due to the Claimants on the account of the
expropriation.”*8’ The representative of Mobil Oil Cerro Negro himself testified during
the proceedings that the claimant “had several meetings with the Ministry of Energy
regarding compensation for government's taking of [their] interests in [...] joint
ventures.” Similarly, the term sheets proposed by the government in ConocoPhillips
“clearly showed that Venezuela intended to take the existing interests of
ConocoPhillips in those Projects [...].”289 In contrast, here PDVSA Agricola and later
the MOA expressed an interest to purchase Vestey’s shares in Agroflora. The offers
relied upon by the Respondent make no reference whatsoever to expropriation or
recovery.

Venezuela also alleges that it repeated its offer of payment in bolivars after the
recovery of Agroflora, a fact which Vestey denies. Minister Loyo maintained in his
witness statement that he called Ms. dos Santos to offer an indemnity and that she
rejected it.2°° During the hearing, Minister Loyo clarified that he made that offer

The Respondent points to Vestey’s board minutes referring to “the continuous pressure to
accept Bolivars” (Exh. C-319). However, this is likely to refer to the offers made in the

personally by telephone.*%' Other than these conflicting statements on the very fact
of this offer, there is nothing in the record confirming that an offer was actually made
and, if so, upon what terms.

What is more, the events that followed tend to belie the thesis that the state offered
compensation for the expropriated assets. Indeed, after the takeover of Agroflora on
13 November 2011, Ms. dos Santos wrote to Minister Loyo soliciting a meeting.?9
Minister Loyo admits that he left this communication unanswered.?%° Shortly
thereafter, Jesper Edelmann traveled to Venezuela and also requested to meet with
the Minister, again in vain. If Venezuela was really prepared to pay compensation,
one would have expected it to entertain these requests and meet with Vestey’s
representatives to advise them of the terms upon which payment could be effected.
In circumstances where Venezuela refused to meet the representatives of Vestey and
failed to answer their written communications, a mere reference to a telephone offer
without any corroboration appears insufficient to establish that the expropriation was
carried out “against prompt, adequate and effective compensation” as required by
Article 5(1) of the BIT.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that Venezuela failed to provide compensation for
the expropriation of Vestey’s assets.

2. Violations of Article 2

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent has also breached Article 2 of the BIT,
which provides protection against unfair, inequitable, arbitrary and discriminatory
measures, and requires ensuring the full protection and security of investments. The
Respondent argues that the Claimant's claims under Article 2 of the BIT are
subsumed in the claim for unlawful expropriation as, once compensation is

context of the sales negotiations and not to the alleged telephone conversation. The
Respondent further points to George Vestey's testifying that Minister Loyo had offered
Bolivars after the expropriation (R-PHB2, 9115, citing Transcript, Spanish, Day 2, 509:8-
18). From the transcript passage cited by the Respondent, it is clear that Mr. Vestey
was answering a question about the sales negotiations in November 2010 (Transcript,
Spanish, Day 2, 508:17-510:2). In the original language, both the question and the
answer started with the words “In November 2010” (Transcript, English, Day 2, 116:1;
116:4).

determined for the taking, "there can be, virtually by definition, no loss or damage left
to be compensated separately based on a breach of other, lesser standards".*% In
any event, the Respondent denies the claim that it has violated Article 2 of the BIT.

At the hearing, the Claimant stated that, if the Tribunal "ma[de] a finding of unlawful
expropriation, with the natural damages consequences", it would not need to consider
the claims for breaches of Article 2 of the BIT.°° On the basis of this statement and
of the principle of procedural economy” and having held that Venezuela is liable for
the unlawful expropriation of Vestey’s investment, the Tribunal will dispense with
ruling on the claims for breach of Article 2 of the BIT.

QUANTUM

The Parties disagree on many issues related to quantum. They primarily diverge on
the applicable standard of compensation (1); causation (2); the method of valuation
(3); the determination of the fair market value of the expropriated assets (4); and
interest (5). The Tribunal will address each of these matters in turn.

1. Standard of Compensation
a. The Claimant’s Position

Vestey seeks reparation for the harm caused by the unlawful expropriation. As
restitution is not available, reparation must take the form of compensation, which will
"wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which
would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed".2°” Opposing
the Respondent's argument that the BIT standard of compensation prevails over the
customary rule of full reparation, Vestey explains that Article 5 of the BIT merely sets
the standard of compensation for a lawful expropriation. As the expropriation was
unlawful, that standard does not apply.

The customary standard of full reparation provides for compensation of the fair market
value ("FMV") of the expropriated asset, together with commercially reasonable
interest.2% Vestey agrees with the Respondent that the value of the expropriated

asset must be established as of the date of the announcement of the recovery of
Agroflora, i.e. 29 October 2011 (the “Valuation Date”). It adds that discounts for
transaction costs or liquidity of the assets are incompatible with the principle of full
reparation.

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent notes that it addresses quantum only ex abundanti cautela and that
none of its arguments should be construed as an acceptance of the obligation to pay
damages.

This said, the Respondent argues that "the customary international law standard of
full compensation is preempted by Article 5 of the Treaty as /ex specialis".°°° Pursuant
to Article 5 of the BIT, the amount of compensation "is limited to [...] the fair market
value of Agroflora".°°' Venezuela observes that the BIT does not limit its
compensation standard to lawful expropriations. It argues that, therefore, the standard
of compensation set forth by Article 5 of the BIT applies to both lawful and unlawful
expropriations.

Even if the standard of full reparation were applicable, the damages would not exceed
the FMV of Agroflora.%? According to the Respondent, the Claimant did not
demonstrate that it suffered a loss exceeding such value.*°° Venezuelan law, so says
the Respondent, only knows one compensation standard, which refers to the “fair
price of the expropriated investment”.°°* Any award of damages should thus be
confined to the FMV of Agroflora on the Valuation Date.

c. Analysis

The Parties agree on the Valuation Date, an agreement that the Tribunal will
implement. They disagree, however, on the standard of compensation and on the
implication of the latter on the methodology for quantifying the value of the
expropriated assets.

By unlawfully expropriating Vestey’s investment, Venezuela has breached its
obligation under the Treaty. The Parties do not dispute that that breach is attributable
to Venezuela. Thus, Venezuela has committed an internationally wrongful act as
defined by Article 2 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,°°° which entails the
international responsibility of the state, and gives rise to an obligation to make full
reparation for the injury caused by the illicit act.9°° The Tribunal notes here that, while
the ILC Articles govern a State responsibility vis-a-vis another State and not a private
person, it is generally accepted that the key provisions of the ILC, such as Article
31(1) can be transposed in the context of the investor-State disputes.

States are free to derogate from this general framework of responsibility.°°” This said,
the Tribunal cannot follow the Respondent when it submits that the rules on
compensation set in Article 5 of the BIT constitute such a derogation. The relevant
part of Article 5 of the BIT prohibits expropriation in the following terms:

“Investments [...] shall not be [...] expropriated [...] except for a public purpose related
to the internal needs of the Party, on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt,
adequate and effective compensation.

The provision goes on to set out the parameters of compensation:

"Such compensation shall amount to the genuine value of the investment
expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the impending
expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier. Such
compensation, shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of
payment, shall be made without delay, be effectively realizable and be freely
transferable.”
In these terms, Article 5 of the BIT does not purport to establish a special regime of
reparation for expropriations which are unlawful due to reasons other than the
absence of compensation. In Chorzéw, the PClJ applied the standard of full reparation
after noting that the wrongful act of Poland did not consist “merely in not having paid
to the Companies the just price of what was expropriated."°° Similarly, Venezuela's

expropriation of Vestey’s investment was not illegal only because no compensation

305 Pursuant to Article 2 ILC of the Articles on State Responsibility, “[t]here is an internationally wrongful
act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission: (a) is attributable to the State under
international law; and (b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State” (Exh. CLA-

19).

extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or

international law” (Exh. CLA-19).

was paid. Venezuela also failed to grant due process as required by Article 5(1) of the
BIT.

The Tribunal is also unconvinced by the Respondent's reliance on its domestic law to
argue that the relevant standard of compensation for expropriation is the “fair price”
of the expropriated asset.°°® By unlawfully expropriating Vestey’s investment,
Venezuela breached its obligations under international law and the consequences of
that breach are exclusively governed by international law.

For these reasons, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that Venezuela must provide
full reparation under customary international law. The Tribunal will thus review the
application of the standard of full reparation to the facts of this case. It notes at the
outset that Vestey claims monetary damages and that Venezuela does not oppose
this form of reparation.

Before closing this discussion of the standard of compensation, the Tribunal must
address the Respondent's alternative argument, according to which “once the
Republic compensates the Claimant for the fair market value of the entire Agroflora
business, the Republic will need to be given the title to [the non-land] assets in return”,
since “the interim measures did not affect Agroflora’s ownership of its assets (other
than the land it allegedly owned)”.*1°

If this argument is characterized as a counterclaim, it must be deemed inadmissible
under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention. Indeed, that provision requires that a
counterclaim be “within the scope of the consent of the parties and [...] otherwise
within the jurisdiction of the Centre.” The scope of the consent to arbitrate is provided
in Article 8 of the BIT. It is limited to “[dJisputes between a national or company of one
Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the
latter under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the former ....” The
Respondent’s request to be awarded title over Agroflora’s assets does not concern
an obligation of Venezuela under the BIT and thus falls outside the scope of the
consent to arbitrate. In the Tribunal’s view, this is a matter to be dealt with by the local
courts in application of municipal property law.

Venezuela’s argument would not be successful either if it were not deemed a
counterclaim but rather a defense against the claim for compensation. Article 5 of the

309 RCM, 4210.
310 R-Rejoinder, 4322.

81

335.

336.

BIT prohibits expropriations and measures tantamount to expropriations which do not
meet the legality requirements without distinguishing between direct or indirect
expropriation. In other words, Article 5 does not distinguish depending on whether title
of the expropriated assets has passed or not. Hence, even where title to the assets is
not formally affected, an unlawful expropriation must be remedied by an award
covering the full value of the property taken.

2. Causation
a. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant contends that Venezuela’s actions deprived Vestey of the entire
economic benefit of its investment.*"' It submits that in situations such as the present
one “the element of causation is implicit in the initial determination that an
expropriation has taken place.”*'? The dismissal of the claims for damages in Biwater,
which the Respondent invokes, is inapposite under the circumstances of this case. In
Biwater, the tribunal dismissed the request for damages on the ground that the value
of the expropriated investment was nil on the date of the expropriation.3"° This is not
arguable here, where both Parties agree that Agroflora had a certain value. The
Claimant adds that whether Vestey’s accounts showed an accounting loss is
irrelevant to the assessment of the economic damages.°?14

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent raised a new argument at the hearing asserting that there was no
causal link between the alleged breaches of international law committed by the
Respondent and the damages claimed by the Claimant. It relied on Biwater to argue
that, in the absence of a showing of damage caused by the unlawful act, there can be
no award of damages.*'® The consolidated financial statements of Vestey Group
Limited do not reflect the losses sought to be recovered in this arbitration. Therefore,
for Venezuela, the Claimant has failed to prove that the alleged breaches of the BIT
caused a loss.

c. Analysis

It is common ground between the Parties that damages are only due if harm was
caused by the wrongful act in question. However, the Parties diverge on whether
Venezuela’s conduct caused damage to Vestey.

The Respondent relies on the Biwater decision to substantiate its position about the
lack of damage sustained by the Claimant. In Biwater, however, the tribunal found
that “by 1 June 2005, being the date BGT [the claimant] states its investment was
expropriated by the Republic, the said investment was of no economic value.”*'° The
tribunal then reviewed the reasons for the depreciation of the investment and came
to the conclusion that “none of the Republic’s violations of the BIT between 13 May
2005 and 1 June 2005 in fact caused the loss and damage in question, or broke the
chain of causation that was already in place.”°'” Hence, in Biwater, the expropriated
asset had lost its entire value at the time of the expropriation for reasons unrelated to
the state’s conduct.

The Biwater scenario cannot be compared to the facts before this Tribunal. In the
present case, there is no dispute that Agroflora had a certain value at the time of the
taking and the Respondent does not claim that Vestey lost its investment for causes
independent from its conduct.

As was established in earlier sections of this award, the Claimant held an investment
in Venezuela through its 100% share participation in Agroflora and Venezuela
unlawfully expropriated the totality of the assets of Agroflora. As a result of this
expropriation, Vestey lost the entirety of the value and economic benefit of its
investment as well as the ability to manage, sell or otherwise dispose of it. The
Tribunal thus has no doubt that causation is established. It is obviously a different
matter to determine the amount of the loss that was caused by the expropriation.

Before the Tribunal turns to the valuation of the loss, it must deal with the
Respondent’s objections that Vestey’s financial statements do not reflect the loss
claimed in this arbitration. It first notes that these statements are not in the record,
which in and of itself disposes of the objection. Moreover, even if they were on record
and their content were to confirm Venezuela’s allegations, they could not do away
with the existence of the damage. Indeed, the fact that a parent company does not

317 Ia, $798.

83

342.

343.

344.

set off the value of its investments or provide for a contingent loss in its accounts
cannot be conclusive evidence of the existence of a loss of the subsidiary. In this
respect, the explanations which Mr. Rosen at the hearing appear plausible. He stated
that “a loss may not even be recorded in a parent company’s accounts in certain
circumstances, including where the parent company has a claim under an investment
treaty and believes that its investment is recoverable.”3'8

3. Method of Valuation
a. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that an asset-based valuation is "[t]he most appropriate
valuation methodology to establish the fair market value of a land-intensive farming
business such as Agroflora ...”5'® Venezuela itself proposed to use this valuation
method during the aborted sales negotiations**°. The FMV of Agroflora, so says the
Claimant, cannot be less than the sum of the FMV of the individual assets, including
vehicles, cattle and real estate.°*' The Respondent's expert, Dr. Flores agreed that “a
willing seller would never agree to sell its business based on a DCF valuation if an
asset-based valuation produced a higher price ...”5?2.

According to the Claimant, the value of Agroflora's assets is not adequately
represented by the cash flow stream that these assets may generate since "the value
of the land is realized only once, with a sale, and not on an annual or other regular
basis" (as captured by a DCF valuation)".°*? Based on the common business practice
of "land banking", Vestey's long term business strategy contemplated that it could sell
parcels of land at a profit from time to time, as it had done with the Santa Clara and
Guataparo Farms, in 1998 and 2007 respectively. Only an asset-based method “takes
into account longer term appreciation in real estate assets which, while not generating
cash flow, may be significantly greater on net than operational returns.”.9%4

Contrary to the arguments of the Respondent's experts, the Claimant argues that
there is a market for Agroflora’s cattle in Venezuela since there is a regulated price
both for beef and livestock.°#° Moreover, Ms. Soriano's rebuttal report well identified

comparable transactions on the Venezuelan real estate market, evidencing the
existence of the relevant market. In any event, any illiquidity on this market can be
explained by Venezuela's measures "overturning established principles of land
ownership". For Vestey, the Respondent should not be permitted to benefit from its
own measures, which is why the valuation is based on a "counter-factual" or "without
measure" scenario. For this, according to the Claimant, the valuations of comparable
land plots in neighboring Brazil would be an appropriate benchmark.°26

The Claimant criticizes not only the method employed by the Respondent, but also
the accuracy of Venezuela’s proposed valuation. According to the Claimant, Econ
One’s DCF valuation is a desktop exercise carried out “without grounding in the reality
of Agroflora’s business expectations”.°?” If Econ One had consulted with
management, it would have learned that Agroflora intended to increase its cattle
sales, as its land reached the carrying capacity in 2011.58 Not having considered this
factor, the Econ One projections cannot be accurate. The Tribunal should thus rely
on the asset-based valuation produced by the Claimant's experts.

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the DCF method is the most appropriate method for
determining the FMV of a going concern like Agroflora. While it agrees that a valuation
based on assets is an accepted method, it argues that it “cannot be used when there
is no reliable market information for the assets being appraised".**9 It also contends
that there is no market in Venezuela for land plots as large as those of Agroflora. Nor
is there any reliable market information for Agroflora's livestock.5°°

Dr. Flores of Econ One explains that, if the asset-based method produces a higher
result than the income-based method, there must be an objective explanation for the
difference.°*' No such explanation exists in the present case. Vestey made the best
possible use of the land. The land plots, being semi-inundated farm land, had no
better potential. Therefore, the cash flows they generated must reflect their full value.

The Respondent further argues that the authorities cited by the Claimant do not
support an asset-based valuation of agricultural businesses.*** In particular, Kantor
states that the DCF method must be used for going concerns, while Ripinsky and
Williams support an asset-based methodology only when the enterprise to be valued
has a low probability of success. Agroflora was a profitable business with a long track
record. Thus, it should be valued under the DCF method.

The Respondent further opposes the Claimant's reliance on arbitral awards such as
Vivendi Il, Waguib Elie, Metalclad, Tecmed, and Wena. The tribunals in these cases
discarded the DCF method only because the enterprise in question lacked a sufficient
record of profits, was unprofitable or at an early stage of development.*%3 None of
these factors are relevant in the present case.

c. Analysis

It is common ground between the Parties that the income-based and the asset-based
methods are both widely accepted in valuation theory. Both methods can be used to
set the FMV of an asset and should in principle yield similar results. However, there
are circumstances which may render one method more appropriate than the other.

On the basis of the record and in particular of the expert evidence, the Tribunal arrives
at the conclusion that the full value of Vestey’s land is not captured by the cash flows
that the business generates. The Claimant has established that it relied on the
occasional sale of parcels of land, which appreciated over time in line with a general
trend of rising prices for agricultural land. The DCF analysis does not reflect this
appreciation, which is captured by an asset-based methodology of comparable sale
and purchase transactions.

The experts on both sides agree that the market practice it to value agricultural farms
under an asset-based methodology.*** The Respondent's expert also testified that
market practice is a relevant consideration when choosing a valuation method.**5 This
appears indeed correct. A valuation is aimed at determining the FMV of an asset,
namely the amount at which the asset would change hands between a willing buyer
and a willing seller. Thus, if the actors in a particular market tend to use a certain

356.

method of valuation in their transactions, the FMV will be best determined by that
method.

The record shows that the asset-based valuation method is not only widely used for
agricultural farms in general, but that it was also employed specifically in relation to
Agroflora. The Respondent’s expert agreed that the Punto de Cuenta of 17 August
2010, on which PDVSA Agricola relied in the sales negotiations, reflects an asset-
based valuation of Agroflora.*° Notably, the government subsequently founded its
purchase offer of 273 million bolivars on that asset-based valuation and not on the
alternative DCF valuation prepared by Vazquez & Asociados upon the instructions of
Vestey.397

The Tribunal cannot follow Venezuela when it contends that there is no market in the
country for Agroflora’s real estate and livestock. As will be discussed in detail in the
following section, the valuation advanced by the Claimant’s experts identifies
sufficient information to arrive at robust results. In particular, the land plots selected
by Ms. Soriano are comparable to Agroflora’s land in terms of bio-economic use. To
the extent that the bio-economic use is comparable, adjustments can then be made
for size, transaction date and other relevant factors. As for the livestock, the existence
of regulated prices allows an accurate calculation of the base price of the herd, which
can then be adjusted to take account of the uncontested genetic quality of Agroflora’s
livestock.

By contrast, the Respondent’s DCF valuation appears flawed. Indeed, Dr. Flores
admitted that the cash flows projections did not take into account the actual cattle
count.°38 As Ms. dos Santos testified, Agroflora’s land would reach its carrying
capacity at the end of 2011,°%° forcing Agroflora to increase cattle sales. In the
Tribunal’s opinion, this would necessarily have an impact on cash flows.

For all these reasons, the Tribunal will value Agroflora adopting an asset-based
methodology. The only asset-based valuation on record is the one offered by the
Claimant’s expert, on which the Respondent has extensively commented. The
Tribunal will thus use this valuation and the Respondent's comments as the starting
point of its assessment.

Fair Market Value

The Claimant's experts divided Agroflora's assets into three categories: livestock, real
estate, and vehicles. For all three categories, they arrived at an aggregate value of
USD 157,363,348.%*° The Tribunal will assess the damages following this division.

a. Real Estate
i. The Claimant's Position

To establish the FMV of Agroflora's real estate, the Claimant relies on the valuation
report provided by Josefina Soriano of Best Valuation Activities (“BVA”). Ms. Soriano
regularly provided valuation services to Agroflora from 1993 to 2011 and her reports
were used to prepare Agroflora's audited financial statements.*4' BVA’s valuations
were also accepted as the basis for the valuation of Hato El Charcote and Hato San
Pablo Paefo, which were sold and donated to Venezuela in 2006.%42

To value Agroflora's land, BVA used comparable land transactions as proxies.°4 If
there were any improvements on the comparable land plots, BVA deducted the value
of such improvements and only retained the value of the undeveloped land. This was
done in this manner because the improvements were valued separately from the land
value by the replacement cost approach.** The value of existing equipment
necessary for the functioning of the structures, including motor pumps, fuel tanks,
electricity generators, but excluding work equipment and tools, were added to the
value of the real estate. Finally, BVA also valued Agroflora's administrative offices in
Valencia. To this effect, it applied a market-based method and used comparable
transactions as proxy.*45

In response to the criticism of the Respondent's experts, Professor Ortega and Econ
One, BVA submitted a rebuttal report, in which it modified the final result of the
valuation. Among other matters, BVA's rebuttal report addressed the objections about
some technical errors in the initial report and about the lack of comparability of the
chosen transactions. The rebuttal report identifies new comparators regarded as
relevant for their climatic, agronomic and socioeconomic characteristics. Such report

also addresses the objection that the number of comparator transaction was
insufficient by extending the time frame back to 2003 and making related inflation
adjustments.**° On such basis, BVA then calculated the average price per hectare in
the Venezuelan states where the Claimant's land was located, with the following
results:

e State of Apure: average USD 115 per hectare;
e State of Guarico — average USD 167 per hectare;
¢ State of Falcén — Average USD 1,702 per hectare.

The Claimant is of the view that BVA’s calculations are conservative. Specifically, the
price calculated by BVA for Hato La Cueva at USD 167 per hectare is significantly
lower than the price of a farm with similar characteristics, Hato El Charcote, which
was sold in 2006 at USD 322 per hectare.*4” Similarly, in neighboring Brazil, land plots
comparable to the ones valued by BVA at an average of USD 115.11 per hectare are
valued at USD 471 per hectare.°4*

In the aggregate, BVA valued Agroflora's real estate at USD 60.9m.

ii. The Respondent's Position

The Respondent observes at the outset that the Claimant itself conceded that"... the
calculations regarding land valuation (including the calculations between comparable
land transactions) in the BVA Report of November 2011 [BVA’s first report] are no
longer relied by Vestey in this arbitration".*49

As to the second BVA report, the Respondent contends that the transactions selected
by BVA cannot be compared to Agroflora's land, as they apply to much smaller areas
than Agroflora's land plots combined.*© In this context, it stresses that Ms. Soriano
was not able to submit a single land transaction as large as 50% of the combined size
of the Farms.**' Moreover, it disputes the bio-economic comparability of the chosen
transactions. To identify such characteristics, BVA relied upon a report prepared by
Gabriel Bittara of Consultoria Ambiental y Disefio Grafico ("CADIGRA") who failed to

disclose that he was a former consultant of Agroflora.*5* Ms. Soriano admitted at the
hearing that she had relied on the CADIGRA report without conducting an
independent verification of the bio-economic characteristics of the comparator land
plots.

The Respondent also challenges BVA's reference to transactions going back to 2003.
It notes that BVA itself recognized that the transactions used as comparators should
be contemporaneous to the Valuation Date*4, but that "out of 24 comparable
transactions used by BVA, only four took place within two years from the valuation
date".355

The Respondent's experts also dispute the methodology adopted by Ms. Soriano to
take account of the differences in size, transaction times and land improvements.*°°
They observe that the adjustments, which relate to land size, transaction time and
payment method, access roads, proximity to nodal points, and improvements,
account for 50% of the price. Being the main value determinant, they render the result

unreliable.°5”

The Respondent disputes that its expert Ortega accepted the value of the
improvements to the land put forward by Vestey. Instead, Professor Ortega insisted
that BVA's first report is invalid in its entirety.25° According to him, BVA counted the
value of the improvements twice: first, as part of the unit price and, second, by a
replacement cost method.°°9

The Respondent further challenges the Claimant's reliance on comparators from
Brazil. It invokes "[t]he economic, social and regulatory differences between Pentanal
Region (Brazil) and the Estates of Apure, Guarico and Falcén (Venezuela)” that “make
any attempt to compare their land prices unworkable".*©° Land as immovable property
can only be valued in the context of its local market. Furthermore, in the Respondent’s
view, Vestey's reference to the sale price of El Charcote in the 2006 Agreement is ill-
placed. By that agreement, Vestey also donated Hato San Pablo Paefio and

undertook to suspend the ICSID proceedings**', which justified the higher price paid
for Hato El Charcote.

iii. Analysis

At the outset, the Tribunal recalls the differences between the land areas which
Vestey claims and those to which its title documents refer. A willing buyer would
necessarily have noted these discrepancies and refused to pay for surfaces of land
that did not appear in the registered title. Thus, the Tribunal is of the opinion that only
the surface area figuring in the title documents is compensable.

In accordance with Annex 2 to the Claimant’s First PHB, the Tribunal finds that
Vestey’s registered titles (column 3) extended to the following areas of the claimed
land (column 2), which thus represent the compensable area (column 4):

55,843.72 106,602.00 55,843.72

42,467.02 36,913.58 36,913.58

111,622.54 99,145.72 99,145.72

39,578.34 46,875.00 39,578.34

12,189.18 oe 0

106.00

294,062.28 319,442.30

Consequently, out of the claimed area of 294,062.28 hectares, Vestey has
demonstrated its legal title in respect of 260,925.57 hectares. The FMV of Vestey’s
land should thus be determined on the basis of this latter figure.

361 R-Rejoinder, 4448.

362 The registered title documents for Hato La Cueva, indicate no area. The figure of 12,189.18 hectares
is drawn from INTI’s 2011 recovery decision. However, this decision merely accounts for the area
taken over by INTI in actual fact, it does not speak to title. Thus, the Claimant has prepared no
registered document evidencing the area of Hato La Cueva, which explains that the Tribunal has not
taken the alleged but unproven surface of this Farm into account.

91

372.

373.

374.

375.

376.

Having determined the surfaces of compensable land involved, the Tribunal must now
assess their value. For this purpose, the Claimant relies on the expert report of
Ms. Soriano of BVA. The Parties do not dispute that Ms. Soriano appraised
Agroflora’s real estate every third year since 1993. Nor is it contested that from 1993
to 2011 her valuations were used as the basis of the book value of the real estate for
purposes of Agroflora’s audited financial statements. Moreover, the government
considered Ms. Soriano’s valuations of El Charcote and San Pablo Paefi to arrive at
the value of those Farms when INTI purchased one and accepted the other as a
donation in 2006.2

Yet, the Respondent questions the independence of Ms. Soriano because she used
information supplied by Vestey about the areas of the land plots and because she
failed to conduct an independent investigation into the technical or biological
characteristics of the comparator land plots reported by CADIGRA.

The Tribunal notes that Ms. Soriano is not a legal nor an agricultural expert. As a
consequence, she could not offer an independent opinion on the validity of Agroflora’s
title and on the areas covered by registered documents. Nor could she advance
independent conclusions about the biological characteristics of the land. It is not
inappropriate for an expert to rely on information supplied by the client if that
information relates to matters outside his or her expertise and the reliance is
disclosed. Similarly, it is not improper for an expert to use the data obtained from
consultants with specific expertise if that use is similarly disclosed.

The Respondent also complains that Ms. Soriano employed registry data gathered by
her assistant. The Tribunal finds this unobjectionable, provided the expert exercised
due care in supervising the assistant. It would indeed be unreasonable to require that
a valuation expert personally collect all the data necessary for his or her report, such
as records from registries located in different regions. In addition, there is no indication
in the record that Ms. Soriano failed to exercise due care or that the data collected by
her assistant is somehow deficient.**

Having reviewed the written evidence and having heard her testify at the hearing, the
Tribunal has no reason to doubt the expertise and independence of Ms. Soriano. The
record shows that she has vast experience in valuing real estate in Venezuela,

363 Bases de Negociaciones Presentadas, Exh. C-248.

364 The Tribunal notes that when the Respondent's expert discovered certain inaccuracies in the registry
information of the comparator transactions, BVA addressed these concerns in the second expert
report.

including in particular Agroflora’s farms, and her methodology appears well
conceived. As a result, the Tribunal is satisfied that nothing prevents it from accepting
BVA's evidence.

To arrive at the FMV of Agroflora’s land, BVA identified 24 comparator land sales
based on the similarity of their bio-economic characteristics. The Respondent
challenges BVA’s report for using comparators significantly smaller in size and dated
as early as 2003. It is undisputed, however, that BVA applied adjustments accounting
for the size of the land plots and the time of the transactions. The fact that the
comparator land plots were not of the combined size of Agroflora’s eleven farms does
not render the comparison unavailing. Nor do the differences in transaction times per
se vitiate the comparison. As the Respondent's expert Ortega testified, there is no
rigid rule concerning the relevant timing of comparator sales.*°> Here, 20 out of the 24
comparator transactions selected by BVA took place within a 5-year range from the
Valuation Date. On this basis, the Tribunal accepts that the transactions chosen by
BVA constituted a valid basis for a comparison, subject to adequate adjustments for
the relevant differences.

As mentioned above, BVA applied a number of adjustments to the comparator
transactions accounting for surface area, access roads, proximity to nodal points,
conditions of payment, improvements, and transaction time. Except for the
adjustments for improvements, which will be addressed below (383), the
Respondent's expert essentially repeats his objections about the choice of
comparators and the multiplicity of the required adjustments.**° He also criticizes
BVA’s choice of the formula of size adjustment recommended by the Costa Rican
Organo de Normalizacién Técnica. According to Professor Ortega, the use of the
Costa Rican formula is ill-founded due to the differences in the bio-climatic conditions
between Costa Rica and Venezuela. The Tribunal has difficulty seeing the connection
between the standard for size adjustments and the differences in bio-climatic
conditions. In the absence of further substantiation from Venezuela's expert, the
Tribunal has no reason to question the methodology of BVA’s size adjustments. Since
the value of Agroflora’s land is adjusted for size, the application of an additional size
discount would be redundant. Indeed, the size adjustments already account for
differences in unit prices of smaller plots compared to larger ones.

To assess the FMV of Agroflora’s land, the Tribunal sought to multiply the unit values
calculated by BVA by the surface areas over which Agroflora’s title is supported by
the registered documents, as established above. Yet, this calculation confronted one
difficulty: while BVA identifies different unit prices for each individual farm, the data on
registered areas sometimes combine two or more farms without specifying how much
land belong to each farm. To avoid any overcompensation by an inaccurate allocation
of land among farms, the Tribunal multiplied the compensable surface area of the
combined land masses (Matapalos and Los Viejitos; Turagua, Cafafistolo and Punta
de Mata) by the lowest unit value determined by BVA. This difficulty did not arise for
Los Cocos and Morichito, since the registered documents justify the entirety of the

claimed area.

On this basis, the Tribunal concludes that the total value of Agroflora’s land amounts
to USD 31,155,964, broken down as shown in the following chart:

32.004,97 363.14 11,622,285.00

USD 31,155,964.00

367 The distribution of surfaces between Matapalos and Los Viejitos inside the documented total area is
unknown. The Tribunal therefore uses the lower unit value for the combined area of the two Farms,
i.e. 672.75 Bolivars/ha.

368 The distribution of surfaces between La Bendicién Ramera, Turagua and Cajiafistolo inside the
documented total area is unknown. The Tribunal therefore uses the lower unit value for the combined
area of the three Farms, i.e. 304.91 Bolivars/ha.

369 The Parties do not dispute that the only official exchange rate applicable on the Valuation Date is
1:4.3/ USD:Bs.

94

384.

Having reached a conclusion on the value of the land, the Tribunal now turns to the
other immovable assets. BVA calculated the value of the non-land immovable
property by reference to the replacement cost and arrived at the following values:

Buildings: USD 6,695,577;
Improvements to the land: USD 5,550,949;
Formed pastures: USD 6,539,570;

Office premises in Valencia - USD 1,360,113.

Professor Ortega objects that BVA double counted the improvements. According to
him, the improvements were directly valued by the replacement cost approach and
indirectly valued in the unit price of the land, as the comparator land plots already
included certain improvements. However, he does not specifically dispute the
calculations made by BVA in reliance on the replacement cost method.

It is true that improvements were present on certain comparator land plots selected
by BVA. However, BVA applied an adjustment in order to arrive at the unit prices. In
a section dedicated to “adjustment for the existence of improvements”, Ms. Soriano
explains that “this valuation of the Farms assumes its lands to be virgin, undeveloped
land, [as] any improvements have been valued separately”.°”° BVA thus excluded the
value of the improvements from the unit prices. Thereafter, it separately valued the
improvements found on Vestey’s land and added their value to the overall value of
the real estate. Therefore, the method of valuation implies no double counting.

That being so, the Tribunal is not convinced that the method used by BVA to adjust
the value of the buildings and improvements is sufficiently accurate. Professor Ortega
points to the fact that Ms. Soriano did not visit the comparator farms to inspect the
improvements. Ms. Soriano admits that, in a number of instances, she had no
information about the value of the improvements present on the comparator lands. In
such cases, “[t]he value of the improvements [was] estimated by reference to the
percentage of the total market value estimated, which pertain to improvements for the
Agroflora Farm that is closest to the reference property or best approximates it in
terms of characteristics” (BVA 2, table 6). Thus, BVA assumed that the improvements
present on the comparator land plots shared similarities with those found on
Agroflora’s land. Such assumptions may have led to substantial underestimation of

370 BVA 2, 953.

95

388.

the share of the improvements in the overall price of the comparable land plots. That
in turn would result in accounting for at least a part of the improvements twice: first in
the unit prices of the land, and second, when valued separately by the replacement
cost approach. In order to avoid such risk of double counting, the Tribunal cannot but
dismiss BVA’s separate calculation of the value of the non-land assets. Such
dismissal does not concern the value of the office premises in Valencia since they
could not have possibly affected the unit prices of Vestey’s agricultural land.

As a result of the foregoing discussion, the Tribunal considers it established that the
value of Agroflora’s real estate on the Valuation Date amounted to USD 32,516,077.

b. Livestock
i. The Claimant's Position

The Claimant provides an expert report from Herb McLane of Agriteam Canada, who
valued Agroflora's livestock, including cattle, buffalo and equine stock, based on
Agroflora's livestock inventory of 30 November 2011. To calculate the base price of a
head of cattle, Agriteam used (i) the regulated beef price of 13.67 bolivars/kilo, (ii)
multiplied by the average weight of bulls and cull cows sent to slaughter, and (iii)
taking into account the so-called "dressing percentage", a proportion of meat to the
animal's live weight. He thus arrived at a base price for bulls of 3,554 bolivars/head
(USD 827/head) and for cull cows of 2,679 bolivars/head (USD 623/head). The
Claimant calls these calculations conservative, as they were based on the regulated
beef price, the "street price" of the beef being around 28% higher.

After identifying the base price, Agriteam applied a genetic multiplier factor (GMF) in
order to account for the genetic merit and contribution of certain animals into the herd.
The GMF varies depending on gender, age and breeding status. The highest GMF of
5 is attributed to breeding bulls, the most valuable animals in the herd.?”! In some
cases, the GMF is less than 1, "signaling young livestock which had not yet fulfilled
their growth potential and contribution to the herd".°”2 According to Agriteam, the GMF
gave full account to fertility, stayability and growth rate of the cattle.

The Claimant argues that the prices calculated by Agriteam are fully supported by
comparators, such as government-controlled prices at which Agroflora sold purebred

371 CM, 9252.

392.

and commercial cattle, prices quoted at local and foreign auctions, as well as prices
paid by the government for imported cattle.°’”? Based on all these factors Agriteam
values Agroflora's 114,327 heads of livestock at USD 92,593,308.

Refuting the Respondent’s argument, the Claimant submits that a size or liquidity
discount is incompatible with the principle of full reparation as “Venezuela took over
all of Agroflora’s livestock and other assets in a single day”.°” In any event, even if
the size discount were applicable in theory, it is not relevant in this case due to the
high demand on cattle existing in Venezuela.°’5 Agroflora’s livestock did not make up
more than 1% of Venezuela’s total national herd.°’° Further, in respect of the
deductions for marketing costs, the Respondent's expert himself testified that such
costs would not exceed 5% of the sales value.°””

In order to demonstrate the conservative nature of its GMF valuation, the Claimant's
expert, David Makin, CFO of Vestey Farm Advisors, provided an alternative valuation
based on productivity metrics. Mr. Makin first calculated the liquidation value of the
cattle, buffalo and equine stock, and then the productivity value of the cattle only
based on the beef output. This calculation does not take into account the value of the
genetic enhancement of the livestock. It thus represents the lowest possible price that
Agroflora could have obtained should it have chosen to sell all of its animals on the
market at the regulated price. With this calculation, Mr. Makin arrived at a final figure
of USD 61.8 million.

In order to then account for the genetic merit of Agroflora’s herd, Mr. Makin drew up
a simulation model over a 10-year period. The model takes account of the potential
of Agroflora's herd to wean a higher number of calves with a higher growth rate
compared to an average non-Agroflora herd. This model shows that over a 10-year
period the Agroflora herd would produce 79% more output than the non-Agroflora
herd. Mr. Makin thus concluded that the genetic merit of Agroflora’s herd warranted
the application of a 79% premium to the base price. By contrast, Agriteam’s valuation
on the basis of the GMF only attributes a 43% premium for genetic merit.

For these reasons, the Claimant submits that Agriteam conservatively valued the FMV
of Agroflora's livestock at USD 92,593,308.

ii. The Respondent's Position

The Respondent objects to Agriteam’s unsupported GMF method. Contrary to the
Claimant's assertions, the Respondent states that it never accepted the use of the
GMF.®%7 Agriteam fails to explain the basis on which it allocates a monetary value to
the GMF.°%”9 The allocation of different values to different traits of Agroflora's cattle is
unsupported. Agriteam’s use of data from Canada as a proxy for testing the GMF is
"wholly inappropriate" given the "completely different environment and market"
existing in Venezuela.%®°

The Respondent also challenges the Claimant's reliance on the prices of the local
auction (Seprocebu). According to the Respondent, at this auction only about
50 heads of purebred cattle are sold annually. Similarly, Vestey incorrectly refers to
the price paid by the government for the importation of cattle from Brazil and
Colombia. That reference is ill-placed as the state has initiated public investigations
about overpricing these transactions.**' As for the auctions in Colombia and Brazil,
they occur on a different market and thus cannot serve as valid comparators.°®2

In relation to Mr. Makin's valuation, the Respondent asserts that the report arbitrarily
assumes a linear increase in the weight of the animals throughout their growth. It
ignores conditions, such as weather and the animal's own characteristics that
influence weight increase. Moreover, Mr. Makin's assumption that Agroflora’s cattle
produced a herd 79% over the baseline of other cattle farms in Venezuela is based
on 1997-2002 input which is outdated. In any event, the conclusion that a 79%
increase in output automatically translates into 79% increase in profit is flawed.5®°
While comparing Agroflora's cattle with that of other producers, Mr. Makin failed to
consider that Agroflora had higher costs than less sophisticated Venezuelan farmers,
including laboratory expenses, management costs, genetic costs, as well as labor,
investment and operative costs.%®

For the Respondent, Mr. Makin also fails to account for the costs of liquidation that
would be incurred had Agroflora decided to dispose of its cattle at once, such as sales

fees, transportation, taxes, marketing and labor costs.%8° Hence, Mr. Makin’s
calculation cannot be used as an alternative valuation of Agroflora's livestock.

The Respondent further submits that the large size of Agroflora’s herd warrants the
application of a liquidity or size discount.%* It also insists that the 34% sales tax
applicable in Venezuela must be deducted from the value of the livestock.%°”
According to Venezuela, the Claimant failed to prove the quantum of the damages by
refusing to give a figure for the size discount. This failure prevents the Tribunal from
assessing damages and thus from awarding any compensation for the livestock. 8°

Finally, Venezuela invokes an email exchange between Ms. dos Santos and
Mr. Edelmann,°**? to assert that by 2008 Agroflora valued its cattle at USD 32.4 million,
a number which stands in stark contrast with the result reached by Agriteam.°%°

For all these reasons, it is the Respondent’s case that the asset-based valuation of
Agroflora's livestock should be discarded.

iii. Analysis

To determine the FMV of Agroflora’s livestock, the Claimant's expert started by
calculating the base price or the “beef value” of the herd. Mr. Makin’s valuation of the
base price takes into account only one possible use of the livestock that is beef. It
does not account for the genetic merit of the herd. The base price of the cattle and
buffalo herd was calculated by reference to Agroflora’s uncontested inventory and to
the average weight of different categories of animals multiplied by the regulated beef
price. Mr. Makin thus arrived at a base price of USD 60,622,750.

The Respondent disputes Mr. Makin’s base price calculation in several respects. It
first contends that the size of Agroflora’s herd imposes a liquidity or size discount. For
the Claimant, on the other hand, such a discount is incompatible with the principle of
full reparation and with the fact that there has been no liquidation of the herd.

The Tribunal’s task is to establish the FMV of Agroflora on the Valuation Date. This is
primarily an economic exercise, which involves identifying the price at which the asset

404.

would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length
transaction where the parties each act knowledgeably, prudently, and without
coercion. The fact that Venezuela took over control of Agroflora in a single day does
not change the Tribunal’s task.

Let us assume that a willing seller presents to a willing buyer an asset-based valuation
of a farming enterprise, in which the value of a herd of more than 100,000 animals is
calculated by multiplying the value of a single animal by the total number of animals.
Under this assumption, the buyer is likely to insist on a size discount, because the
demand for 100,000 animals taken together is lower than the demand for a single
cow. A similar consideration guided BVA when it applied a size adjustment to
Agroflora’s land. As the Claimant itself underscored, “[the size adjustment] reflects
the fact that smaller properties tend to be more desirable and attract higher prices
than larger ones”.5%

That being said, the Tribunal’s task is not to value an abstract farming enterprise, but
to determine the FMV of Agroflora taking into account the actual circumstances in the
Venezuelan market. In this context, it recalls that Agroflora’s livestock represented
less than 1% of Venezuela’s national herd and less than 8% of Venezuela’s annual
slaughter capacity.*°? Moreover, as the Respondent's expert testified, Venezuela
imported cattle from abroad at prices above the regulated price to resell it on the
domestic market at the regulated price.°°? In other words, it used to bear the difference
in price by way of subsidies. In 2011, imports amounted to around 320,000 heads of
cattle, i.e. three times Agroflora’s herd. Hence, had Agroflora desired to sell its
livestock, the market demand in Venezuela would most likely have been high. The
government at least would have been willing to acquire Agroflora’s entire herd to
reduce spending higher amounts to purchase cattle from abroad. As a result, the
specific market circumstances do not justify the application of a size or liquidity
discount.

Second, the Respondent argues that the 34% sales tax should be deducted from the
value of the livestock. According to the Respondent, the sales tax is applicable on the
sale of goods, such as livestock, but not on the sale of an agricultural enterprise. The
Tribunal notes that the asset-based valuation presented by the Claimant is aimed at
determining the value of Agroflora as a going concern. Such valuation does not

408.

409.

contemplate a sale of the individual assets of Agroflora. The individual assets are only
valued based on the premise that they would be sold to a willing buyer in combination
with one another, as part of one enterprise. Therefore, the Tribunal understands that
the 34% sales tax would not be payable and thus no adjustment is required.

Third, Professor Ortega further criticizes Mr. Makin’s calculation of the average weight
of the different categories of Agroflora’s animals. According to him, Mr. Makin
arbitrarily assumed that the weight of the animals would grow linearly between
different ages.°°* The Tribunal notes that Professor Ortega does not challenge the
actual data of animal weights extracted by Mr. Makin from Agroflora’s records. This
undisputed data determines the average weights of different categories of animals at
birth, as well as at the ages of approximately 8, 18, 36, and 60 months. It also takes
into consideration the weight loss of the animals after the age of 7-8 years.

The Tribunal understands that the weight of the animals at milestone ages of their life
is established. What is in dispute is merely the evolution of the weight curve from one
milestone to the other. In circumstances where the expert had no opportunity to
measure the animals between the milestones and the Respondent's expert provides
no indications on the evolution of the curve, assuming linear weight growth (and
weight loss after 7-8 years) appears like a reasonable approximation of the reality that
lies within the Tribunal’s discretion in matters of assessment of the quantum.

For these reasons and for lack of further substantiated objections to Mr. Makin’s
calculation of the “beef value”, the Tribunal is convinced that the base price of
Agroflora’s cattle and buffalo, without considering the genetic merit, amounts to USD
60,622,750.

Fourth, the Respondent relies on an email message which was sent by Ms. dos
Santos to Mr. Edelmann on 30 May 2008. There, Ms. dos Santos estimated the value
of Agroflora’s herd at USD 32.4 million. The Tribunal has asked itself whether that
estimate could be used as a benchmark for its valuation of the herd. It has essentially
answered this question in the negative for various reasons. First, in her own words,
Ms. dos Santos was replying with “a very simplistic calculation based on our
assessment of the Country actual situation, our best judgement, and the strategic
strength of our cattle herd now [...]"°°5 to a request from Jesper Edelmann for “some
information”, which “does not have to be very elaborate”. Second, the figure provided

by Ms. dos Santos factored in the fact that a part of the Farms was occupied by
indigenous squatters, resulting in an increase of cattle theft, further threatening the
remaining Farms.%°° These problems no longer existed three and half year later on
the Valuation Date. Third, it is undisputed that Agroflora’s herd increased in numbers
between 2008 and 2011. Without considering those factors, the estimate could not
have accurately reflected the actual value of the herd. Fourth, since Ms. dos Santos’s
estimate in 2008, Agroflora was subjected to expert valuations several times. For
instance, in November 2009, Ernst & Young valued Agroflora’s assets based on a
thorough analysis and multiple visits at the Farms. It was on the basis of this expert
valuation that PDVSA Agricola offered USD 120 million for the shares of Agroflora in
2010.58” Genetic multiplier factor or GMF

Having determined the “base value”, the Claimant’s expert then valued the genetic
merit of Agroflora’s livestock by attributing GMF figures to different categories of the
cattle. The GMF figures vary from 0.35 (for commercial calves) to 5.00 (for purebred
bulls) multiplied by the average weight of the respective category of animals. The
Respondent objects that these GMF figures have no connection with the actual
economic and market data.

The Tribunal notes that the Parties agree on the high genetic quality of Agroflora’s
herd.°°8 The Respondent's expert also testified that the market is prepared to pay
more for a higher quality herd, which certainly makes commercial sense.°°°

The question remains, however, how much the market would pay for the genetic merit
of Agroflora’s herd? Agriteam represents that in assigning the particular GMF values,
it considered factors such as fertility, stayability and growth rate. It does not, however,
explain how those factors translate into the particular figures of the GMF. For instance,
it has not justified why the market would pay five times the “beef price” for breading
bulls. A reason could possibly have been that such bulls have a potential to generate
five times more income in comparison with ordinary bulls without the same genetic
merit. However, Agriteam presented no such economic analysis. Mr. Makin attempted
to offer an economic justification of the GMF by a productivity simulation model. The
model calculated the value of the increase in productivity of the livestock owing to the
genetic merit*, but, as the Respondent's experts rightly observe, it fails to take into

account the increased expenses associated with establishing and maintaining the
high genetic quality herd. It is undisputed that Agroflora owned and operated a genetic
laboratory and incurred other expenses related to the genetic program as well as the
increased security needs. Without accounting for such expenses, Mr. Makin’s
simulation model cannot serve as an accurate economic justification for Agriteam’s
GMF figures.

The Claimant further sought to justify its results by pointing to several market
benchmarks, including the prices at which cattle was imported by the government as
well as the prices of purebred cattle at the auctions in Venezuela and abroad. The
Tribunal first notes that the prices paid by the government for imported cattle, as well
as those paid at foreign auctions cannot serve as appropriate value indicators, since
those transactions do not occur in the Venezuelan market. As for the records of the
Seprocebu auctions, they reflect the sales of individual animals where the potential
buyer has an opportunity to review the genetic data of each animal. The prices
achieved in such settings may not accurately represent the value of the genetic merit
of the different categories of Agroflora’s cattle.4°' Moreover, the Seprocebu data
identifies prices only for purebred bulls and cows, which is insufficient to establish the
value of the genetic merit of the other categories of Agroflora’s herd.

For the reasons just discussed, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant has not
established the value of the genetic merit of Agroflora’s herd in a sufficiently reliable
manner. As a consequence, the Tribunal cannot but award compensation at the base
price of the livestock. The base price of Agroflora’s cattle and buffalos was held to
amount to USD 60,622,750. One must add the value of the equine stock calculated
by Agriteam at USD 1,152,126, which is not controversial. Therefore, the Tribunal
finds that the total value of Agroflora’s livestock amounts to USD 61,774,876.

c. Vehicles
i. The Claimant's Position

The Claimant relies on the valuation of its vehicles provided by Ingenieria Automotriz
C.A ("INMA"). INMA’s calculation is based on the replacement cost of the vehicles. It
applies the depreciation factor in order to account for the age of the vehicles.‘

401 The authorization issued by the ad hoc board (Exh. C-322) is insufficient for establishing the FMV of
the genetic merit for each category of Agroflora’s herd.

Agroflora owned three types of vehicles: general vehicles, tractors, and a light
airplane. The Claimant further relies on Agritruck’s valuation letter, which appraised
the 43 Ford New Holland tractors owned by Agroflora based on the information
received from the Ford New Holland official dealership in Argentina.4°° The Claimant
explains the references to comparators from Argentina by governmental limitations in
Venezuela causing a low turnover of agricultural vehicles. As for the 1979 Cessna
182Q airplane, the Claimant relies on the replacement cost for which it was
ensured.‘

The Claimant opposes the Respondent's allegation that the vehicles were subject to
heavy use and wear. It submits that the vehicles were kept in good working conditions
and that INTI's report confirmed the "buenas condiciones" of the vehicles.4°° The
Claimant argues further that its valuation takes account of the age of the vehicles as
well as their wear and tear due to the harsh conditions in which they operated*® by
applying a depreciation factor. Following Venezuela's objection that INMA used a
valuation in 2012 and not on the Valuation Date, the Claimant reverted with a
valuation as of November 2011. The revised valuation produces a lower result, as
inflation pushed prices up between 2011 and 2012.4°7

In rebuttal to the Respondent's argument that the insurance cost of the airplane is not
an appropriate proxy, the Claimant puts forward examples of sales of comparable
airplanes in Venezuela.‘ It also argues that the airplane website listings relied upon
as comparators by Venezuela are invalid, as they list prices in the US and prices of
airplanes in the US and Venezuela differ due to Venezuelan import restrictions.*°°

The Claimant finally counters the Respondent's argument that the price of subsequent
repair of the airplane must be deducted from the valuation. According to the Claimant,
it kept the airplane in good condition and, "[i]n fact, the invoice for maintenance filed
by Venezuela (dated five months after the takeover of Agroflora) indicates that more
than half of the maintenance costs of 137,000 bolivars that Venezuela is now trying
to deduct from the value of the airplane had already been paid by Agroflora as a credit

into its account in July and November 2011 (when the company was still under the
control of Vestey)".*'° Therefore, Vestey claims the full value of the airplane.

As a result, the Claimant contends that the FMV of its vehicles as of the Valuation
Date amounted to USD 3,854,372.

ii. The Respondent's Position

The Respondent submits that, unlike for the livestock and real estate, there is a
market in Venezuela for Agroflora’s vehicles, but that the Claimant miscalculated the
relevant value.‘""

According to Venezuela, INMA’s first valuation was erroneous because it referred to
the period of December 2012/January 2013. Its second valuation is equally
misleading, as it values vehicles used in normal conditions. Agroflora's vehicles,
however, were used in severe weather conditions, in flooded and muddy areas.‘'?
Similarly, Agritruck’s valuation of Agroflora's tractors is unreliable, as it lists the prices
of tractors in perfect condition, when the conditions under which Agroflora's tractors
operated were extremely harsh.*?

Moreover, Venezuela takes issue with the valuation of the Cessna 182Q airplane.
The insurance replacement value, so says the Respondent, does not reflect the FMV.
The listings on US websites offer the same plane model at significantly lower prices.
Moreover, the airplane underwent overdue repairs in April 2012, the cost of which
must in any event be deducted from the valuation.4"4

For these reasons, the Respondent's position is that the valuation of Agroflora’s
vehicles is unreliable and this amount must thus be disallowed.

iii. Analysis

The Respondent does not challenge the inventory underlying the valuation of the
vehicles or the existence of the relevant market in Venezuela. Its objections to this
item of damages focus on two aspects.

First, the Respondent submits that Agroflora’s valuation does not take into account
that the vehicles operated in harsh climatic conditions. The Tribunal finds it difficult to
accept this submission for a number of reasons. It starts by recalling that INTI's report
confirmed that Agroflora’s vehicles were in good condition.‘ It also notes that the
Claimant’s expert applies a depreciation factor reflecting the age of the vehicles.
Further, as the Claimant rightly underlines, tractors are vehicles designed for tough
conditions. Finally, it is telling that Venezuela has not sought to substantiate its
objection with evidence of the condition of the vehicles, when it was in control of the
fleet since late 2011.

Second, the Respondent objects to Vestey’s valuation of the airplane, which is based
on the insurance replacement cost of USD 185,023. 41° It claims that planes of this
type are offered at lower prices in the U.S. It also notes that maintenance costs should
be deducted. The Claimant has satisfactorily rebutted the first argument by submitting
evidence of prices of comparable airplanes, which confirm the reasonableness of the
valuation.*'” Vestey has equally established that Agroflora had paid more than half of
the future maintenance costs in advance before the expropriation.*'® Be this as it may,
the maintenance costs were incurred after the expropriation and there is no indication
on record that it was due to the usage of the airplane by Vestey before the
expropriation. The Tribunal is thus satisfied that the value of the vehicles and the
airplane is established in an amount of USD 3,854,372.

d. Conclusion

On the basis of the reasons discussed in this section, the Tribunal considers that the
FMV of the cattle farming business of Agroflora on the Valuation Date, as it has been
established in these proceedings, amounted to USD 98,145,325.

Vestey requests pre-award interest to bring Agroflora's FMV forward to present
value‘'®, because "[t]o the extent the payment is delayed, Vestey loses the
opportunity to use the compensation to productive ends [...]".47°

The Claimant argues in favor of applying the rate of Venezuela's sovereign bonds in
US dollars. Such a rate, so says the Claimant, "will account for the fact that Venezuela
has had use of the compensation amount since the date of injury, effectively
compelling Vestey to lend it funds without remuneration".*2' It adds that "[a]n award
of interest at a rate lower than the state's borrowing cost would create an incentive for
states to 'refinance' fiscal obligations by withholding compensation for internationally
wrongful acts".4#2 The rate of the sovereign bonds amounts to 11.75%, which is lower
than Agroflora's WACC, determined at 13% by Venezuela itself. According to the
Claimant, applying the rate of Agroflora’s WACC is another commercially sound
alternative.*?5 The Claimant rejects the Respondent's choice of the US Treasury bond
risk-free rate, as being merely meant to achieve the lowest possible result.
Alternatively, it claims interest at 6 month LIBOR +2%.44

Furthermore, the Claimant requests that interest be compounded semi-annually in
accordance with standard business practice.‘?> It opposes the Respondent's
argument that Venezuelan law governs the issue of compound interest. In reliance on
BG, It submits that "the Chorzéw standard 'would not be achieved if the award were
to deprive Claimant of compound interest”.4?® Compounding will result in the effective
rate being 12.10%. Thus, the claim for pre-award interest until the date of the Second
PHB, amounts to USD 82,426,582.

In order not to incentivize Venezuela to postpone the payment of the award, the
Claimant also requests post-award interest accruing from the date of the award until
payment in full.42” It submits that post-award interest should be computed at the same
rate as the pre-award interest and should be also compounded semi-annually.

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the Claimant is not entitled to pre-award interest, which
is not compatible with the BIT standard of compensation. If any, interest should accrue
after a 60-day grace period following the award.4?8 A grace period is necessary to
account for the state’s internal payment procedures.‘”9 In the alternative, pre-award
interest should accrue from the time when the Republic became aware of the claims,
i.e. from the Claimant's first memorial which was filed on 15 January 2013.4°°

Further, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant is only entitled to the rate
applicable to US Treasury bond, as it faces no lending or investment risk in relation
to an investment that it no longer owns.**! Higher interest rates, such as Venezuela's
15 year sovereign bond, WACC or Libor +2%, fail to acknowledge that interest is only
meant to compensate the Claimant for not having the use of its money. In particular,
the WACC and the Venezuelan sovereign bond rate proposed by the Claimant
account for the long term risk of sovereign default. However, the Claimant does not
bear these risks.‘5? Similarly, LIBOR plus 2% is irrelevant as the Claimant has not
shown that it needed to borrow money because it did not receive its compensation
from the recovery of Agroflora immediately.*%>

Moreover, for Venezuela, the Claimant is not entitled to compound interest. Pursuant
to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal should apply Venezuelan law
as the Parties have not agreed on the law applicable to interest. Venezuelan law does
not provide for compound interest, except where the Parties have specifically agreed
on it‘4, which is not the case here. International tribunals do not award compound
interest when the law of the respondent state does not provide for it (citing CME,
Autopista). In addition, an award of compound interest must be justified as part of the
damages granted to a claimant. Here, the Claimant has not even attempted to show
that it incurred a loss by not being able to earn compound interest.435

For these reasons the Respondent contends that interest, if any, should start running
at the end of a 60 day grace period following the final award, interest should be simple;
and the rate should be risk-free.49°

c. Analysis

Vestey claims both pre- and post-award interest. The Respondent objects that no pre-
award interest is due. It argues in particular that the standard of compensation of the
BIT does not warrant an award of pre-award interest.

As discussed above, Venezuela is under a duty to repair all the consequences of its
internationally wrongful act and the BIT standard of compensation does not apply to
unlawful expropriation. It is well established in the practice of international tribunals
that pre-award interest is necessary to fully compensate the loss caused by an

unlawful expropriation.49”

A state’s duty to pay damages arises at the time when the internationally wrongful act
causes harm, which is in the present case the Valuation Date. This duty does not
arise later, such as on the date of the injured party's complaint or of the judgment. As
a result, interest will start running on the Valuation Date until payment in full.

The Parties also diverge on the interest rate. The Claimant argues for the rate of
Venezuelan 15-year sovereign bonds. The Respondent objects that this rate accounts
for a long term risk of sovereign default, which Vestey does not assume.

The function of reparation is to compensate the victim for its actual losses. It is not to
reward it for risks which it does not bear. As the Claimant itself argues, the award
should reestablish the situation which would in all probability have existed but for the
wrongful measures. As the Parties agree on the Valuation Date, the “but for” scenario
involves placing Vestey in the position in which it would have been if it had received
compensation on that date. In that case, Vestey would have been able to make use
of the funds received as compensation. At no point in that scenario would Vestey have
borne the risk of Venezuela's sovereign default. The Claimant argues that “[a]n award
of interest at a rate lower than the state's borrowing cost would create an incentive for
states to 'refinance' fiscal obligations by withholding compensation for internationally

wrongful acts".4°° However, reparation focuses on making the victim whole; it is not
concerned with the possible enrichment of the Respondent. As the SPP tribunal
stressed, "the measure of compensation should reflect the claimant's loss rather than
the defendant's gain."4°°

Alternatively, the Claimant suggests Agroflora’s weighted average cost of capital or
WACC as interest rate. In the Tribunal’s view, this is not an appropriate measure for
interest here. Indeed, the WACC reflects a variety of risks associated with doing
business. After the expropriation, Vestey was no longer doing business in Venezuela
and did not assume these risks. In the “but for” scenario, it would have received the
compensation on time, i.e. on the Valuation Date, and would have incurred no

business related risks anymore.

As another alternative, the Claimant proposes to use a borrowing rate, specifically
LIBOR plus 2%. This could indeed be an appropriate rate if the Claimant had to
borrow funds because it did not receive the expropriation indemnity on time. In the
present circumstances, there is no indication in the record to this effect, with the result
that the Tribunal discards this possibility.

The Claimant further argues that the interest rate should reflect the risk that
Venezuela may not comply voluntarily with the Tribunal’s award, which the
Respondent opposes.

Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention creates an international obligation for the
respondent state to comply with the award in the following terms:

“The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or

to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall

abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement
shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.”

First and foremost, the Tribunal does not find it appropriate for it to assume by
anticipation that a sovereign state will breach a treaty obligation. Having said this,
even if the assumption were made, it would in any event not justify an interest rate
incorporating the risk of defaulting on the payment of the award. Indeed, accounting
for this risk would mean seeking to repair a (hypothetical) breach of the ICSID
Convention when this Tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited to breaches of the BIT.

446. In conclusion, the Tribunal will resort to a risk free rate applicable to US currency debt,
ie. the six-month US Treasury bond rate. The practice of international tribunals
confirms this conclusion.“*° So, for instance, in the words of the Siemens tribunal:

“(T]he rate of interest to be taken into account is [...] the interest rate the amount of
compensation would have earned had it been paid after the expropriation. Since the
awarded compensation is in dollars, the Tribunal considers that the average rate of
interest applicable to US six month certificates of deposit is an appropriate rate of
interest. "44"

447. The Parties further diverge on whether interest should be compounded. The Tribunal
cannot follow the Respondent when it argues that compound interest is inadmissible
as a matter of Venezuelan law. The consequences of internationally wrongful acts are
governed by international law. International law requires that Vestey be reinstated in
the situation in which it would have been had it received the compensation on the
Valuation Date. It would then have been able to deposit the amount and earn interest.
It is standard practice that interest on deposits is compounded. Thus, the Tribunal is
of the view that, to make Vestey whole, interest must be compounded. Case law
confirms this choice.442

448. The Parties agree on the applicability of post-award interest. The Tribunal considers
that interest must accrue at the same rate and upon the same terms both before and
after the award. This is the consequence of the fact that the Respondent's obligation
to pay damages does not arise on the date of the award but rather at the time when
the internationally wrongful act caused harm. For the same reason, there is no legal
justification for granting a grace period.

449. Therefore, interest on the amount awarded shall accrue at the rate applicable to six-
month US Treasury bonds, compounded semi-annually, from the Valuation Date until
payment in full.

should be borne by the other Party. In this section the Tribunal will summarize the
Parties’ respective positions (1 and 2) and discuss the allocation of costs (3).

1. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant requests the Tribunal to order the Respondent to pay all the costs of
this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the legal representation and expert
advice, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, and the ICSID administrative fees.
According to the Claimant, in exercising their discretion in matters of costs allocation
under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, tribunals often rely on the “loser pays”
principle.*4* They also look to the procedural conduct of the Parties. The Claimant is
of the view that a number of factors militate for an award of costs in its favor.

First, in order to achieve full reparation, the Claimant must be compensated for all the
costs that it incurred as a result of the Respondent's unlawful conduct, including the
costs of the arbitration proceedings.*** Thus, if the Tribunal decides the substantive
issues in favor of the Claimant, the costs must follow such determination.

Second, Venezuela’s procedural conduct in the course of the document production
significantly increased the Claimant's legal and expert costs. In particular, the
Republic only disclosed “a grand total of 28 documents in relation to six of the 40
requests ordered by the Tribunal or agreed to by Venezuela”. Vestey adds that the
documents were in any event largely unresponsive or already in its possession. It also
stresses that, “the Respondent refused to disclose the Ernst & Young valuation report,
which would have saved substantial efforts in establishing the value of the
expropriated assets”. In contrast, Vestey fully cooperated in the document production
phase “eventually producing some 360 documents to Venezuela in the course of that
exercise”.445

Third, Venezuela ambushed Vestey by raising a new untimely and unmeritorious
jurisdictional objection on the first day of the hearing. This required additional

submissions and two rounds of post hearing briefs, which imposed substantial
additional costs.

Fourth, in the Rejoinder, Venezuela improperly filed evidence that it had obtained
unlawfully when it took over Agroflora. It also improperly produced documents that it
should have filed with the Counter-Memorial. Vestey was forced to request the
Tribunal to strike the improper evidence. The Tribunal granted Vestey’s request as to
the privileged documents and allowed Vestey to produce additional documents in
rebuttal. Venezuela nevertheless continued to refer to the documents.*4* Vestey
further incurred extra costs in connection with the rebuttal evidence.

Fifth, throughout the hearing, Venezuela relied on the materials not on record. It also
introduced 14 new legal authorities without previously notifying Vestey or the Tribunal.
This behavior obliged Vestey to raise an objection.*4”7 Thereafter, Venezuela
introduced new factual and legal exhibits in its second PHB contrary to the applicable
procedural rules. The Tribunal exceptionally admitted those documents and Vestey
had again to file additional evidence in rebuttal.

On this basis, the Claimant seeks reimbursement of all the costs incurred in relation
to this arbitration in the aggregate amounts of USD 1,920,310.85 and GBP
7,659,105.76, broken down as follows:

(i) USD 675,000, corresponding to the Claimants’ advance on the ICSID fees and
expenses;

(ii) GBP 7,285,955.74, corresponding to the fees and disbursements of the
Claimant's international counsel, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP;

(iii) USD 476,470.99, corresponding to the fees and disbursements of the
Claimant’s Venezuelan counsel, Travieso Evans Arria Rengel & Paz;

(iv) USD 768,839.86, corresponding to the fees and expenses of the Claimant's
valuation experts, FTI Consulting;

(v) GBP 45,811.72, corresponding to the fees and expenses of the Claimant's
Venezuelan land expert Soriano Cabrera of BVA;

(vi) GBP 275,149.43, corresponding to the fees and expenses of the Claimant's
cattle expert McLane (Agriteam Canada);

(vii) GBP 52,188.87, corresponding to reasonable travel and other expenses
incurred by the Claimant for the purposes of these arbitral proceedings, including
travel costs and related expenses of the Claimant’s witnesses and representatives.

Vestey also asks the Tribunal to order Venezuela to pay interest on the amounts just
listed at the rate of 11.75% applicable to Venezuela’s 15-year sovereign bonds from
the date of the costs submission until the date of payment, compounded semi-
annually.

2. The Respondent’s Position

Venezuela requests the Tribunal to award it all the costs of this arbitration including
the fees and expenses of the legal representation and expert advice, the fees and
expenses of the Tribunal and the ICSID administrative fees. According to the
Respondent, the Tribunal has broad discretion to award costs pursuant to Article 61 (2)
of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Rule 47 provided that its award is based on sound
reasoning.*#® When making its cost determination, the Tribunal should take account
of “[t]he degree of success of the parties”, any dilatory tactics or misconduct
throughout the proceedings, as well as the “adoption of an excessive, frivolous or
unreasonable position”.“4° Venezuela relies on the following circumstances to justify
its request for costs.

First, after the suspension of the arbitration as a result of the settlement reached
through the 2006 Agreement and in spite of Venezuela’s full compliance with the
terms of that agreement, Vestey recommenced the proceedings in 2011 by submitting
an entirely new dispute before the Tribunal. The Republic was thus forced to defend
itself and incur enormous expenses. *°°

Second, Vestey has sought on several occasions to deprive the Tribunal of evidence
that could have been useful to find the truth. It requested the exclusion of certain
valuation documents prepared in the course of Agroflora’s sales negotiations. The
Tribunal, however, did not grant such request and only ordered that these documents

be redacted.*5' The Claimant further attempted to exclude documents obtained by
Venezuela when it took over Agroflora, although those documents could have shed
light on Agroflora’s sales negotiations and in particular on the issue of convertibility of
the offered bolivars.*5

Third, during the hearing, the Claimant objected to Venezuela’s reliance on Vestey’s
financial statements even though those statements were submitted by Vestey during
the document production phase. Vestey also unsuccessfully sought to exclude new
legal authorities introduced by the Republic during the hearing.*5°

Fourth, the Claimant mounted another attack to exclude evidence introduced by the
Respondent with its second PHB. The Tribunal again denied that request. Vestey also
unsuccessfully tried to prevent the Respondent from substantiating its answers to the
Tribunal’s questions with relevant evidence.4°4

Fifth, on a number of occasions, the Claimant provided false information to the
Tribunal. In particular, the Claimant’s expert BVA admitted the existence of factual
inaccuracies in its first report and sought to clarify them in the second report. Another
example is Vestey’s reliance on land areas that are not corroborated by any

document.

For the foregoing reasons, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to order Vestey to
bear all costs of this arbitration as follows:

(i) For the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID administrative fees:
USD 525,000.00;49°

(ii) For the costs of representation and legal assistance: USD 4,989,157.45;

(iii) For the cost of the hearing and the expenses incurred for travel, accommodation
and supplies: USD 74,152.90.

Therefore, the aggregate costs requested by the Respondent total
USD 5,588,310.35.

3. Analysis

Both Parties seek an award of the entirety of the costs related to this arbitration,
including the legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with these proceedings.

The Claimant’s costs amount to USD 1,920,310.85 and GBP 7,659,105.76, which
includes USD 675,000 paid by the Claimant as advance of ICSID arbitration costs.
The Respondent's costs amount to USD 5,588,310.35, which also includes
USD 525,000 advanced to ICSID.

The Parties have not disputed that the Tribunal has broad discretion to allocate the
costs of the arbitration, including the Parties’ legal fees and expenses, as it deems
appropriate pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention:
In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the
proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and
expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities
of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.
The Tribunal has considered all of the Parties’ arguments as well as the
circumstances of this case. It observes in particular that (i) the Respondent's raised a
new preliminary objection at the final hearing; (ii) Contrary to the applicable rules, it
introduced new factual exhibits and legal authorities in its second PHB, which the
Tribunal exceptionally admitted, (iii) it failed to comply with the Tribunal’s order on
document production in respect of Ernst & Young’s report on Agroflora’s valuation, a
document that might possibly have simplified the quantification exercise.

In light of these factors and of an overall assessment of the course and outcome of
these proceedings, the Tribunal concludes in its discretion that it is fair for the
Respondent to bear the entirety of the ICSID arbitration costs, i.e. the fees and
expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID’s administrative fees, the amount of which costs
will arise from ICSID's final financial statement in this case. For the remainder of costs,
the Tribunal considers it fair for each Party to bear its own legal fees and other costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this arbitration.
