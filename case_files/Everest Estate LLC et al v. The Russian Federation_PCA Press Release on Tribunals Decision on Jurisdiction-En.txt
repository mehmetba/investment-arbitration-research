PCA PRESS RELEASE

 

ARBITRATION BETWEEN EVEREST ESTATE LLC AND OTHERS
AS CLAIMANTS AND THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION

THE HAGUE, 5 APRIL 2017
The Tribunal Issues Its Decision on Jurisdiction

As reported previously (Press Release dated 13 January 2017), after the hearing on jurisdiction and
admissibility was held in this matter in New York on 15 December 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties
to file post-hearing submissions to address any issues arising from the hearing by 31 January 2017.

On 16 January 2017, the Tribunal posed two additional questions to the Parties and invited them to file
their responses together with their other post-hearing submissions. The Claimants filed their post-
hearing brief on 31 January 2017. The Respondent did not file any post-hearing submissions.

On 20 March 2017, having deliberated, the Tribunal issued its unanimous Decision on Jurisdiction.

Background: The above-referenced arbitration was commenced by the Claimants against the Russian
Federation pursuant to the Ukraine-Russia BIT and in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules 1976 on 19 June 2015. The Claimants contend that, as of August 2014, the Russian Federation
breached its obligations under the Ukraine-Russia BIT by interfering with and ultimately expropriating
their investments in real estate located in Crimea.

The Tribunal was constituted on 27 October 2015. It is comprised of Dr. Andrés Rigo Sureda (Presiding
Arbitrator), Professor W. Michael Reisman (appointed by the Claimants), and Professor Dr. Rolf
Knieper (appointed by the appointing authority, Mr. Michael Hwang, on behalf of the Respondent).

Under the instructions of the Tribunal, the PCA will issue press releases from time to time containing
information on the procedural steps taken by the Tribunal. Basic information about the proceedings is

available on the PCA Case Repository http://www.pcacases.com.
