FACTUAL BACKGROUND
THE DORNOD PROJECT

From 1988, commencing under the communist Mongolian People’s Republic, to 1995, the
Russian state-owned company Priargunsky Production Mining and Chemical Enterprise
(“Priargunsky”) extracted uranium oxide from an open pit mine located in Dornod, a province
in the north-east of Mongolia.’ Due to a shortage of funds and a drop in demand for uranium

after the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. in 1991, the mine was shut down in mid-1995,"°

Around the same time, Priargunsky and the Mongolian state-owned company Mongol-Erdene
(“Erdene’’) formed a joint venture known as the Central Asian Uranium Company (“CAUC”)
with the U.S. company WM Mining Inc. (“WM Mining”), in order to develop a uranium

exploration and extraction project in Dornod (“Dornod Project”).

The founders of CAUC executed three following documents: (i) the Founding Agreement,

(ii) the Agreement on Development of Mineral Deposits in Eastern Aimak of Mongolia

(“Minerals Agreement”), and (iii) the Charter of the Company with Limited liability “Central
Asian Uranium Company of Mongolia of the Mongolian-Russian-American Venture”
(“Charter”).'' The Minerals Agreement was also signed by an authorized representative of the
Mongolian Ministry of Energy, Geology, and Mining.'” Under these agreements, WM Mining

undertook to contribute financial capital to the Dornod Project.'?

Initially, each of the three parties held an equal 33.3 percent share of the joint venture. On
12 December 1996, WM Mining’s participation in CAUC was increased to 58 percent with
Erdene and Priargunsky each maintaining a 21 percent share.'* Thereafter, Erdene’s share in
CAUC was successively transferred to the Mineral Resources Authority of Mongolia
(“MRAM”) on 27 November 2001, the State Property Committee of Mongolia (“SPC”) on
28 March 2005, and MonAtom, a Mongolian company wholly owned and controlled by the
SPC, in 2009.'° MonAtom itself was incorporated in 2009."°

In July 1997, WM Mining transferred its shares to the British Virgin Islands company World
Wide Mongolia Mining Inc.'’ This company was acquired by Khan Canada on
30-31 July 2003, through Khan Canada’s newly incorporated wholly-owned subsidiary Khan
Resources Bermuda Ltd (“Khan Bermuda”).'* Khan Canada had been incorporated in Ontario,
Canada on | October 2002, with the sole purpose, according to the Claimants, of investing in
Mongolia." Following Khan Canada’s acquisition of World Wide Mongolia Mining Inc., the
latter was renamed CAUC Holding on 28 April 2004.

When this arbitration commenced in 2011, Priargunsky and MonAtom each held a 21 percent
share in CAUC, while CAUC Holding, the wholly owned subsidiary of Khan Bermuda, in turn
the wholly owned subsidiary of Khan Canada, held the remaining 58 percent share in CAUC.

On 27 March 2003, Khan Canada established a separate subsidiary incorporated in Mongolia —
Khan Resources LLC (“Khan Mongolia”) — to help coordinate its activities in Mongolia.”

Originally, all of the shares in Khan Mongolia were held by Khan Bermuda.

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction
On 5 September 2007, Khan Canada incorporated Khan Netherlands for the specific purpose of
holding Khan Mongolia.’ On 29 May 2008, the Foreign Investment and Trade Agency of
Mongolia (“FIFTA”) issued a “Certificate of Foreign Incorporated Company” recording the
transfer of 75 percent of the shares in Khan Mongolia to Khan Netherlands and indicating that

the other 25 percent remained with Khan Bermuda.”

On 10 November 1998, the joint venture company CAUC obtained the mineral exploration
license 237A (“Mining License”), which allowed CAUC to engage in the exploitation of

. . . . «33,
radioactive mineral resources on a specific area of land in the Dornod region.”

On 22 April 2005, Khan Mongolia, then wholly-owned by Khan Canada through Khan
Bermuda, obtained the mineral exploration license 9282X (“Exploration License,” collectively
with the Mining License, the “Mining and Exploration Licenses”), which allowed it to
conduct radioactive mineral exploration within the boundaries of an area of land neighbouring

the one covered by the Mining License.”

As background to their decision to invest in Mongolia, the Claimants allege that in recent years
Mongolia’s economy has become one of the “fastest growing in the world” due to its mineral
wealth and a twenty-plus year campaign to “lure foreign investment to the country” by creating

“the appearance of a positive investment environment by enacting laws and entering contracts

25

that, at least on their face, promise a high level of protection to foreign investors.

In reply, the Respondents state that the allegation that Mongolia sought to lure investment by a

deceptive foreign policy is neither credible not substantiated. After its transition into democracy

Counter-memorial, para. 123. At the hearing, the Respondents stated that Khan Netherlands was
incorporated on 4 January 2008, referring to the date of an excerpt of the Amsterdam Chamber of Commerce
trade register; however, this document also states that the date of the “incorporation deed” is 5 September
2007 (Hearing Transcript 22:4-5; Exhibit C-116a/C-116b).

Memorial, para. 17, referring to Exhibit R-4; Counter-memorial, paras. 115-116.

Memorial, para. 20, referring to Exhibit R-6; Counter-memorial, para. 120. While observing that this is not
relevant to the Tribunal’s determination on jurisdiction, the Claimants argue in their Counter-memorial that,
contrary to the Respondents’ assertion, the areas covered by the Mining and Exploration Licenses are not
“two distinct, albeit adjacent projects,” but “a single mining project,” which came to be known under two
names and covered by two mining licenses due to a surveying error. Accordingly, the Claimants submit that
Khan Canada acquired the Exploration License “for the purpose of benefiting all of the joint venture
partners,” with the intention to “merge” the Mining and Exploration Licenses in due course. At the hearing,
the Claimants referred to Exhibit C-39, the minutes of a CAUC shareholders’ meeting, noting that Khan
Canada would have to include the Exploration License to ensure the “effective, efficient and sustainable
operation” of the project (Hearing Transcript 146:24-149:8). In their Rejoinder, the Claimants further argue
that the Respondents’ failure to include any documentary evidence or rebuttal on this matter in their Reply
should preclude any further attempts by the Respondents to describe the Mining and Exploration Licenses as
unrelated or unconnected (Counter-memorial, paras. 111-122; Rejoinder, paras. 28-29).

Decision on Jurisdiction
in 1990, Mongolia spent considerable time and effort to encourage foreign investment. It now
benefits from a good reputation among investors. In this context, Mongolia continues “to act

lawfully and in full legitimacy.””°

THE CLAIMANTS’ INVESTMENT IN THE DORNOD PROJECT
The Parties disagree on the extent to which the Claimants invested in the Dornod Project.”

The Respondents argue that the Claimants have not carried out any ore production at the sites
covered by the Exploration and Mining Licenses, and that, once Khan Canada obtained an
indirect shareholding in CAUC, it “floated its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2008,

generating millions of dollars in capital,” the benefit of which was never seen in Mongolia.”*

According to the Respondents, the Claimants’ contention that they invested over
USD 50 million in the project is not borne out by the thousands of pages of factual evidence
they have produced. The Respondents argue that the Claimants have in fact made inconsistent

estimates of the value of their investment.

The Respondents note that Khan Canada’s 2007 Annual Report states that Khan Canada did not
intend to make any substantial investments until an investment agreement was concluded with
Mongolia. This was confirmed by Mr. Martin Quick, Khan Canada’s then President and
C.E.O., in an interview following Khan Canada’s entry on the Toronto Stock Exchange.” In
2010, the Claimants claimed before the Mongolian Capital City Administrative Court
(“Administrative Court’) to have made an investment of more than USD 10 million. In a
letter sent in April 2010 to the Mongolian Prime Minister, the Claimants’ valuation of their
investment had increased to USD 20 million. In this arbitration, the Claimants seek

compensation in the amount of USD 200 million.”

As for the surveys allegedly carried out by the Claimants, the Respondents assert that the

resulting reports either repeated or copied information collected during the period when

Priargunsky operated the Dornod site.*!

Reply, paras. 42-45.

The Respondents emphasise that they do not consider the issue of valuation of the Claimants’ investment to
be pertinent to the jurisdictional phase of these proceedings, but nonetheless address this issue in their
submissions.

PCA Case No. 2011-09

Decision on Jurisdiction
By contrast, the Claimants allege that, starting in 2004, Khan made “considerable and
significant progress on the exploration and development” of the Dornod Project.” Initially, the
Claimants spent time raising money through private investment fundings and on the Toronto
Stock Exchange, and complying with Mongolian legal and regulatory requirements necessary
for Khan Canada to acquire the CAUC shares.** The Claimants allege that Khan then spent
more than USD 50 million toward the Dornod Project, and contributed valuable intellectual

capital and technical expertise.

The Claimants contend that when Khan Canada joined the project, the joint venture was
running on a “care and maintenance” basis, and could not move forward without Khan

; . se 3
Canada’s financial and technical investment.**

The Claimants emphasize that Khan Canada’s 2011 consolidated audited financial statements
confirm a cumulative deficit (from 1 October 2002 to 30 September 2011) of USD 46,438,000.
Combined with Khan Canada’s long-term assets of over USD 15 million (capital assets plus
mineral interests), the amount expended on the Dornod Project is well in excess of USD 50

aye 3s
million.”

In particular, Khan confirmed the existence and extent of the uranium reserves in the Dornod
site by conducting a magnetometer and gravity survey, as well as an extensive program of

drilling and metallurgical testing, beginning in early 2005.*°

Khan also assessed and refined the economic and technical parameters necessary to determine
the economic viability of the project by conducting four “difficult, time-consuming, and costly”
studies providing an extensive analysis of, among other, the resources and reserves at the site
and the costs and methodologies required to exploit the mine in an economically feasible

37

that they have shared all their reports and studies with Mongolia.”

With regard to the Respondents’ allegation that the Claimants’ exploration work reproduced
surveys carried out when Priargunsky operated the Dornod site, the Claimants acknowledge
that significant exploration data was developed by Priargunsky before 1995, but explain that the
data was not verifiable or reproducible because the underlying exploration material (e.g., the
drill core) was destroyed when Priargunsky abandoned the site. Thus, over 8,000 metres of
additional drilling was performed to verify and expand upon the data collected by Priargunsky.
Moreover, according to the Claimants, Priargunsky had neither conducted any social and
environmental impact assessments, nor developed mining plans or engineered processing and

support facilities.”

Furthermore, the Claimants dispute the Respondents’ allegation that the Claimants did not
share the results of their studies with Mongolia, submitting that had Khan’s studies duplicated

Priargunsky’s work, there would have been no need for Khan to share results with Mongolia.""

THE INVALIDATION OF THE MINING AND EXPLORATION LICENSES

In April 2005 and April 2009, the State Specialised Inspection Agency of Mongolia (“SSIA”)
inspected the Dornod site. In July 2009, the SSIA issued a report raising a number of alleged
violations of Mongolian law by CAUC in connection to its mining operations in Dornod (“July
2009 Report”). The same month, the MRAM informed CAUC that the Mining License was
temporarily suspended due to the results of the 2009 SSIA inspection and, in the Respondents’

view, to Khan’s failure to remedy the alleged legal violations.”

In September 2009, Khan challenged the temporary suspension of the Mining License before
the Administrative Court. However, the case was settled “pursuant to an agreement reached
between CAUC and the MRAM, in connection with the negotiation of the 2010 Memorandum
of Understanding,” subsequently entered into by Khan Canada and MonAtom on

22 January 2010 (“2010 MOU”).

On 8 October 2009, the Mongolian Nuclear Energy Agency (“NEA”) issued Decree No. 141,

suspending the Mining and Exploration Licenses.“* The NEA had been created a few months

earlier under the Nuclear Energy Law of Mongolia (“NEL”), which came into effect on

15 August 2009.

The NEL was enacted for the purpose of “regulating exploitation of radioactive minerals and
nuclear energy in the territory of Mongolia for peaceful purposes, ensuring nuclear and
radioactive safety and protecting population, society, and the environment from adverse effects
of ionizing radiation.“* According to the NEL, Mongolia was to take ownership, without
compensation, of “no less that 51 percent of stake in the joint company, where exploration and

determination of [uranium] reserve have been conducted with state budget.” “

According to the Respondents, Decree No. 141 suspended 149 uranium exploration and
exploitation licenses, pending confirmation from the NEA of their re-registration under the

NEL.“

The Claimants contend that the Mining and Exploration Licenses should have been re-issued
pursuant to the 2010 MOU. The 2010 MOU also provided that MonAtom would henceforth
own 51 percent of CAUC in compliance with the NEL.”

On 15 March 2010, a governmental “Inspection Group” issued a report setting forth alleged
violations of Mongolian law concerning the Mining and Exploration Licenses. On
9 April 2010, the NEA issued notices to both CAUC and Khan Mongolia, stating that their

respective Mining and Exploration Licenses were invalidated.

On 15 April 2010 and 23 April 2010 respectively, Khan Mongolia and CAUC each commenced
proceedings against the NEA before the Administrative Court to challenge the invalidation of

the Mining and Exploration Licenses.”

On 19 July 2010, in the proceedings initiated by CAUC, the Administrative Court rendered a
decision with regard to the Mining License, stating that its invalidation was “clearly
unlawful.”*' This decision was confirmed on appeal by the Appellate Court of the

Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of Mongolia on 13 October 2010.”

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction
On 2 August 2010, in the proceedings initiated by Khan Mongolia, the Administrative Court
rendered a decision with regard to the Exploration License, stating that its invalidation was

“clearly invalid.””*

According to the Respondents, the Administrative Court found that certain “formal
administrative” procedures had not been correctly followed but “did not cast any doubt upon
the suspension of the Mining and Exploration Licenses pending re-registration in accordance

with the NEL.”

In the Respondents’ view, since the challenges by CAUC and Khan Mongolia before the
Administrative Court did not extend to the substance of the allegations of regulatory breaches
made against them, the Claimants “were found to have been in violation of numerous different

»55 Moreover, the decisions of the Administrative Court confirm

provisions of the regulations.
that Mongolia did not act discriminatorily, as CAUC and Khan Mongolia were only two among

many license holders whose licenses were suspended.”°

The Parties agree that the Mining and Exploration Licenses were not re-issued after the
purported April 2010 invalidation. The Respondents explain that Mongolia could not re-issue
the licenses because of the outstanding alleged breaches of Mongolian regulations by CAUC

and Khan Mongolia.”

According to the Claimants, the purpose of the inspections, license suspensions, and license
revocations carried out in 2009 and 2010 against Khan was to expel Khan from the CAUC joint
venture in order to allow for a strictly Mongolian-Russian joint venture to develop Mongolia’s

uranium projects in the Dornod region.

In this respect, the Claimants allege that after Mr. Kiryenko, General Director of RosAtom, the
Russian state nuclear agency, and ultimate owner of Priargunsky, visited the Dornod site in
May 2008, the press reported in January 2009 on an announcement by Mr. Kyrienko and then
Mongolian Prime Minister Mr. S. Bayer of plans to create a new Mongolian-Russian joint

venture.”

Furthermore, during a visit by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to Mongolia in August
2009, the press reported that Russia and Mongolia had agreed that their joint venture would
specifically “focus on the Dornod deposit.” According to the Claimants, Mongolia thus

announced its intention to oust Khan from the Dornod Project.”

EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE INVALIDATION OF THE MINING AND
EXPLORATION LICENSES
The Parties provide divergent accounts of the events following the April 2010 invalidation of

the Mining and Exploration Licenses.

The Claimants allege that they sought to resolve the dispute amicably, in particular through a
letter sent on 15 April 2010, 6 days after the Mining and Exploration Licenses were invalidated,
by Mr. Quick to the Mongolian Prime Minister Mr. Sukhbaatar Batbold (“Letter to the Prime
Minister”).

The Claimants also refer to trips made by Mr. Quick, Mr. Edey, who replaced Mr. Quick as
President and CEO of Khan Canada as of 10 June 2010, and other representatives of Khan
Canada to Mongolia to meet with Mr. Ragchaa Badamdamdin, the Chairman and CEO of

MonAtom, and other Mongolian representatives in April, June, and October 2010.°

According to the Claimants, during these visits to Mongolia Mr. Badamdamdin repeatedly
advised Khan Canada that the Director of the NEA, Mr. Sodnom Enkhbat, “was resolutely
opposed to Khan’s participation in the Dornod Project, and was unlikely to engage in any

settlement discussions.”

The Claimants further contend that during a meeting in October 2010 between Mr. Edey and
representatives of the NEA, the SPC, and MonAtom, Mr. Enkhbat was “extremely antagonistic
toward Khan,” convincing Mr. Edey of the futility of Khan’s efforts to achieve amicable
dispute resolution. The Claimants also note that Mr. Enkhbat made numerous vitriolic and
public attacks against Khan in the press, supporting Khan’s conclusion that amicable resolution

of the dispute was not possible.”

67. The Respondents, in turn, state that the Claimants have not attempted to rectify their breaches

of Mongolian law preventing the re-issuance of the Mining and Exploration Licenses.

68. Instead, the Respondents argue, the Claimants tried to put pressure on them by commencing
court proceedings in Ontario against Atomredmetzoloto JSC, the owner of Priargunsky,
embarking on an “aggressive publicity campaign against Mongolia, publishing correspondence
directed at intimidating Mongolia,” and commencing and rendering highly public these

international arbitration proceedings.”

IV. LEGAL PROVISIONS RELEVANT TO THE DISPUTE

and the operations of the foreign invested business entity shall be resolved in the Courts of
Mongolia unless provided otherwise by international treaties to which Mongolia is a party or
by any contract between the parties.

THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS
The Respondents’ position

The Respondents submit that the Claimants, aware of the “weak legal footing of their
complaints,” have conflated “various different claims, claimant entities, and legal bases,”
bringing their claim under various legal instruments and multiplying claimant parties.
According to the Respondents, “when properly deconstructed,” it becomes clear that the
Claimants have no basis on which to bring any of their claims and accordingly the Tribunal has

no jurisdiction to hear them.
The Claimants’ position

According to the Claimants, the Respondents’ assertion that the Claimants fail to explain which
claimant entities are bringing which claims is “illogical” and an “attempt to create chaos where
none exists,” given that the Claimants have clearly stated in their Notice of Arbitration that
Khan Canada and CAUC Holding are bringing claims under Article 12 of the Founding
Agreement and that Khan Netherlands is bringing claims under Article 26 of the ECT, while all

Claimants are invoking Article 25 of the Foreign Investment Law.”

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction

BURDEN OF PROOF
The Respondents’ position

The Respondents submit that all facts relevant to determining jurisdiction must be “considered
in full and proved at the jurisdiction[al] stage.””” The Respondents reject the Claimants’
position that at the jurisdictional stage of the proceedings the Claimants’ factual assertions must

be taken pro tem by the Tribunal, once the Claimants have made a prima facie case.”

In the Respondents’ view, the Claimants misconstrue the prima facie test by failing to
distinguish between facts that bear on jurisdiction and facts that bear on the merits. To apply
the test correctly, as explained in Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic (“Phoenix”), the Tribunal
must “look into the role . . . facts play either at the jurisdictional or at the merits level. . . . If the
alleged facts are facts that, if proven, would constitute a violation of the relevant [treaty], they
have indeed to be accepted as such at the jurisdictional stage, until their existence is ascertained
or not at the merits level. On the contrary, if jurisdiction rests on the existence of certain facts,

72

they have to be proven at the jurisdictional stage.

The Respondents submit that because the purpose of the present proceeding is to “definitively
determine whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the claims brought before it,” both
Parties must be given the opportunity to present their version of the facts related to
jurisdictional issues, none of them being taken pro tem.” The contrary would defeat the

purpose of bifurcating the proceedings.”

The Respondents dispute the Claimants’ contention that the “fundamental principles of justice,
fairness, and equality between the parties” require that the Claimants’ version of the facts be
accepted by the Tribunal, arguing instead that accepting the Claimants’ version of the facts pro

tem would impede the Respondents’ right to be heard on the jurisdictional issues.”

Finally, according to the Respondents, none of the authorities cited in the Claimants’ Counter-
memorial support their position. Thus, the reasoning in Glamis Gold Ltd. v. United States
applies solely to decisions on requests for bifurcation, not to the consideration of issues of

jurisdiction after bifurcation is granted, and the dissent of Judge Higgins in Oil Platforms

(Islamic Republic of Iran v. United Stated of America) refers only to the facts related to the

merits.”°

The Respondents argue that, contrary to the Claimants’ assertion, they have advanced a version
of the facts relevant to the determination on jurisdiction. According to the Respondents, if these
facts also have a bearing on the merits of the case, this “does not cause the fundamental and

irremediable injustice that the Claimants contend.”

Further, the Respondents specify that the Claimants bear the burden of proving all the facts
relevant to jurisdiction, as “[t]here is no presumption of jurisdiction, particularly where a

A Pan 9978
sovereign state is involved.
The Claimants’ position

In their written submissions, the Claimants assert that they must make a prima facie case on
jurisdiction, while the Respondents bear the burden of proving the facts on which their
jurisdictional objections rely. To this effect, the Claimants rely on Article 27(1) of the
UNCITRAL Rules, which provides that “[e]ach party shall have the burden of proving the facts
relied on to support its claim or defence,” and the principle of actori incumbit probatio, “long
recognized as the fundamental rule governing the burden of proof before international courts

and tribunals.”

At the hearing, the Claimants further explained that the party asserting the affirmative of a
proposition bears the initial burden of proof, “which then shifts to the party making the contrary
view.”* In application of this principle, the Claimants bear the initial burden of proving that
(i) Khan Canada is a party to the Founding Agreement; (ii) Mongolia is a party to the Founding
Agreement; and (iii) the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione materiae over claims brought under
the Founding Agreement. The Respondents must rebut these propositions. With respect to the
claims brought under the ECT, the Claimants bear the initial burden of showing that the general

jurisdictional requirements of the ECT have been met, while the Respondents bear the burden

of proving the facts that underlie the “exceptions or affirmative defences” they invoke, such as
the fork in the road and denial of benefits provisions of the ECT (Articles 26(3)(b)(i) and
170)"

The Claimants also argue that once they have made a prima facie case, their factual assertions
regarding merits must be taken as true pro tem at the jurisdictional phase. This is required by

fundamental principles of justice, fairness, and equality between the parties.

If the Claimants were required to prove disputed facts by a preponderance of evidence at the
jurisdictional phase, they would effectively be deprived of their right to a full hearing on the
merits, as the Tribunal could decide on these facts before such a hearing. Accordingly, the
Tribunal should only examine whether the facts alleged, if ultimately proven, are capable of

falling within the scope of the instrument from which the Tribunal derives its jurisdiction.”

The Claimants reject the Respondents’ contention that the Claimants wish all facts, including
jurisdictional facts, to be accepted by the Tribunal pro tem. The Claimants accept the
“uncontroversial proposition that, unlike facts concerning the merits, purely jurisdictional facts

must be proven at the jurisdictional phase.”**

The Claimants note that any facts relating to the merits, including those that are also relevant to

jurisdiction, “must be fully and finally determined only at the merits stage.”**

The Claimants submit that they have “firmly established their affirmative case on jurisdiction
through reference to documentary evidence, witness and expert testimony, and credible legal
theories,” while the Respondents, to the extent that they have made allegations that are
“exclusively (or even primarily) relevant to jurisdiction,” have provided “almost no evidence

whatsoever in support of those allegations.”

In particular, the Respondents have submitted no evidence or counter-evidence showing that:
(i) it was not the intention of the signatory parties to the Founding Agreement that Khan
Canada should be a party to this agreement; (ii) MonAtom and its predecessors were not the

Government’s representatives in CAUC; (iii) MonAtom is not directly controlled by Mongolia;

The Claimants add that the Respondents’ recitation of facts is mostly irrelevant to the issue of

THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION OVER KHAN CANADA’S AND CAUC HOLDING’S
CLAIMS UNDER THE FOUNDING AGREEMENT

Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction ra/one personae over Khan Canada
The Respondents’ position

The Respondents acknowledge that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione personae over claims
brought by CAUC Holding against MonAtom under the Founding Agreement, because CAUC
Holding and MonAtom are parties to the Founding Agreement, by virtue of being successors,

respectively, to WM Mining and Erdene, the original signatories of the Agreement.**

By contrast, the Respondents submit that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction ratione
personae over claims brought by Khan Canada under the Founding Agreement because Khan
Canada is a party neither to the Founding Agreement nor to the arbitration agreement contained

- 89
therein.

The Respondents specify that Khan Canada did not sign the Founding Agreement or any of its

four amendments, and that the Founding Agreement was not assigned to Khan Canada.”

According to the Respondents, the question of whether Khan Canada is a party to the Founding

Agreement and to the arbitration agreement contained therein should be resolved on the basis of

Founding Agreement (see Counter-memorial, paras. 163-192).

Decision on Jurisdiction
Mongolian law. Pursuant to Article 12.1(i) of the Founding Agreement, Mongolian law is the
governing law of the contract. The Respondents assert that, where an applicable law is chosen
by the parties to a contract, there is a strong presumption that the law applicable to the

arbitration clause is the law governing the substantive agreement."

In the Respondents’ view, the Claimants mistakenly invoke Dow Chemical France, The Dow
Chemical Co. and others v. ISOVER Saint Gobain (“Dow Chemical”) and the so-called “group
of companies doctrine,” as Mongolian law recognizes neither this case nor this doctrine.”

In any event, the “group of companies doctrine” is “merely a shortcut to avoid legal

993

reasoning.” In fact, the analysis in Dow Chemical and subsequent French case law rests on

consent — the “common intention of all the parties to the proceedings (i.e. the signatory and

non-signatory parties) that the non-signatories be bound to the arbitration agreement.””*

The Respondents argue that in the present case, the proper parties to the Founding Agreement
did not form a common intention that Khan Canada, a non-signatory, be a party to the
arbitration agreement of the Founding Agreement. According to the Respondents, the excerpts
from various documents invoked by the Claimants as evidence of such common intention are in

fact only “acknowledgements . . . of the indirect shareholding of CAUC by Khan Canada.”**

Moreover, in order to extend an arbitration agreement to a non-signatory party, this party must
at least have played a role in the contract’s creation and performance. Yet Khan Canada,

incorporated in 2002, did not even exist when the Founding Agreement was signed in 1995.°°

In addition, the fact that the 2010 MOU contemplated Khan Canada and MonAtom concluding
a “formal joint venture agreement to govern the development, construction and exploration of
the Dornod Project” shows that Khan Canada was not at the time a party to any such joint

venture.”

Decision on Jurisdiction

The Claimants’ position
With regard to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae over Khan Canada, the Claimants
submit that “entities that are not signatories to a contract that contains the relevant arbitration

agreement may nevertheless be parties to that agreement.””*

100. The Claimants submit that the question of whether Khan Canada, a non-signatory of the

Founding Agreement, is nonetheless a party to the arbitration agreement contained therein is an
inquiry “more factual than legal” and may be decided on the basis of the facts of the case,

rather than on the basis of applicable law.”

101. Nevertheless, the Claimants assert that French law, and not Mongolian law as claimed by the

Respondents, governs the arbitration agreement and therefore the analysis of the Parties’
consent to arbitration. According to the Claimants, Article 12.1(i) of the Founding Agreement,
invoked by the Respondents, identifies Mongolian law as applicable to the substantive
provisions of the contract, but not to the arbitration agreement.” The Claimants argue that
pursuant to Article 23(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, an arbitration clause is “an agreement
independent of the other terms of the contract” and can be governed by a law other than that
governing the other terms of the contract. In the present case, as the law applicable to the
arbitration agreement is not identified in the Founding Agreement, the arbitration agreement is
governed by the law of the seat of arbitration, ie. Paris, France. Accordingly, French law

applies to the question of whether Khan Canada is a party to the Founding Agreement. '!

102. In any event, the Claimants submit that, whether or not deciding only on the basis of the facts

100

101

102

103

or on the basis of French law as the applicable law, the Tribunal must evaluate the common
intention of the parties to the Founding Agreement, based on the conduct of the parties
throughout the life of the contract and “all relevant facts and circumstances of the case.”!” The
Claimants refer to what they consider to be the test laid down in Dow Chemical and approved
by subsequent tribunals and commentators: “whether factual circumstances exist that
demonstrate that the non-signatory party is a ‘real party’ to the contract and/or arbitration
agreement, by virtue of its role in the performance or termination of the contract(s) containing

+9103

the arbitration clause.”””” The Claimants add that the key inquiry is whether “related companies

involved in a transaction or contract form ‘a single economic reality’ (une réalité économique

unique).” tot

103. Alternatively, the Claimants argue that if Mongolian law is applicable, Khan Canada is

nevertheless a party to the Founding Agreement, given that Mongolian law, and in particular
Article 43.3 of the Civil Code of Mongolia(“Civil Code”), provides for implied consent to

contract through conduct.'°*

104. The Claimants submit that, in the present case, Khan Canada was “a real party in interest” with

“primary responsibility for coordinating and financing the entire Dornod Project.”!”° In fact,
without Khan Canada, the Dornod Project would not have been possible, as Mongolia and
MonAtom were well aware.'”’ In particular, the Respondents “fully understood, accepted, and
agreed” that CAUC Holding, the successor to WM Mining under the Founding Agreement, was
ultimately wholly owned and controlled by Khan Canada. The Respondents also “fully
understood, accepted, and agreed” that all of the Claimants’ contributions to the Dornod Project
= financial, technical, or otherwise — came from Khan Canada.’ Thus, the minutes of a CAUC
management committee meeting held on 26 August 2009 evidence MonAtom’s recognition that
Khan Canada had completed and even exceeded its commitments “as per the original Founding
Agreement.” Similarly, the minutes of the CAUC management committee meeting of
9 November 2009 recognize the expected benefits of Khan Resources’ planned contribution of

the Exploration License to the joint venture.'!”

Claimants highlight that (i) representatives of Khan Canada participated in CAUC
shareholders’ meetings in the capacities of “Chairman” and “voting member;”"'* (ii) the SPC
and MonAtom negotiated memorandums of understanding with Khan Canada in 2005 and 2010

governmental agencies repeatedly identified Khan Canada as the Canadian partner in the

Mongolia-Russia-Canada joint venture (CAUC).'”°

106. In addition, the Claimants explain that all the reports and studies necessary for the exploration

and development of the Dornod Project were prepared and paid for by Khan Canada.'*"

107. According to the Claimants, Appendix A of the 2010 MOU further shows that the exploitation

122

of the Dornod Project would have been financed largely by Khan Canada.

108. Consistent with the decision in Dow Chemical, Khan Canada was therefore the party in a

position to ensure the performance of CAUC Holding’s obligations under the Founding

109. Dow Chemical also took into account the attempt of the respondent in that case to join the

parent company in a related lawsuit against its subsidiary. The Claimants point out that,
similarly, in the present case, Mongolia referred to the conduct of the parent company, Khan
Canada, to justify the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses held by the
subsidiaries, CAUC Holding and Khan Mongolia.'*

111. The Claimants argue further that, contrary to the Respondents’ assertion, there is no

requirement for a non-signatory to have played a role in the creation of the contract to be a
party thereto. It is therefore irrelevant that Khan Canada did not exist when the Founding

Agreement was concluded.'”*

112. Finally, the Claimants state that the above facts demonstrate that the parties to the joint venture

understood and accepted that Khan Canada was a party to the Founding Agreement and the
arbitration agreement therein. The Claimants emphasize that the Respondents provide no
evidence to the contrary, merely insisting on the fact that Khan Canada did not sign the

Founding Agreement.'””

Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction a/ove personae over Mongolia

The Respondents’ position

113. The Respondents submit that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction ratione personae over

claims brought against Mongolia under the Founding Agreement, given that MonAtom is the
only respondent entity that is a successor to a signatory of the Founding Agreement (Erdene)
and that MonAtom and Mongolia are separate entities.'** The Respondents explain that
MonAtom, while a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mongolia, is a “business entity with a separate
legal personality . . . carrying out standard corporate business.”'”” An arbitration agreement

signed by an independent state-owned entity does not bind the state.'”

114. The Respondents submit that MonAtom’s registered corporate articles and the Company Law

126

127

128

129

130

32

133

of Mongolia of 1999 (“Company Law”) affirm MonAtom’s independent character.'*! Thus,
the Company Law states at Article 9.3 that “shareholders shall not be liable for the obligations
of the company.”'*? MonAtom’s charter provides that “[t]he company is 100 percent a state-
owned limited liability company and shall be a profit seeking legal entity with independent
balance sheet, shall be empowered to enjoy rights and obligations on its own behalf, and shall
have its own distinct assets,” without any statement that MonAtom carries out its obligations or

133,

engages in activities on behalf of Mongolia.~’ MonAtom’s charter further shows that

MonAtom is “constrained to act as an ordinary independent business, from the nature of the
decisions taken at Shareholders’ Meetings, to the actions implemented by the Board of

: sold
Directors.”!*

115. The Respondents also contend that MonAtom’s conduct supports the notion that it operates

independently from the Government. For instance, the fact that the NEA, a state agency,
purported to invalidate the 2010 MOU entered into by MonAtom and Khan Canada shows that
MonAtom does not act in tandem with the Government, as otherwise MonAtom would not
have signed the 2010 MOU in the first place.'** Moreover, the fact that the Claimants wished to
negotiate an investment agreement with Mongolia, as stated in the 2010 MOU, shows that they

did not consider that Mongolia was a party to the Founding Agreement.'**

116. Additionally, contrary to the Claimants’ assertion, the fact that MonAtom is ultimately held by

the state does not suggest that MonAtom entered into the Founding Agreement as an authorised
representative of Mongolia.'*’ Article 3.7 of the Founding Agreement draws a clear distinction
between Mongolia and the parties to the joint venture by separately establishing their respective

liabilities.'**

117. Furthermore, the Claimants cannot rely on the Minerals Agreement to establish that MonAtom

is an instrument of Mongolia.'* The Minerals Agreement is “entirely irrelevant” to the present

dispute, given that no claims have been brought under it.'“°

118. In any event, the Minerals Agreement clearly indicates that MonAtom and Mongolia are

134

135

136

137

138

139

140

141

separate entities. For instance, Article 18.1 of the Minerals Agreement states that it is
“contingent on approval by the Government of Mongolia,” thus showing that Erdene, the
Mongolian signatory of and MonAtom’s predecessor under the agreement, is not a

representative of the Government.'*!

119. Further, as established by case law, the signature of an “authorized representative of the

Mongolian Ministry of Energy, Geology and Mining” on the last page of the Minerals

Agreement does not mean that Mongolia is a party to this agreement.'

120. The Respondents reject the Claimants’ argument that the Minerals Agreement and the Charter

should be construed as evidencing Mongolia’s role in CAUC, because the cited provisions only

serve to recognize that the Government would “necessarily feature in the regulation and

143.

oversight of the project. For this reason, the Parties “expressly separated Mongolia from

incurring liability by way of the Founding Agreement’s Article 3.7, and by contracting with a

private limited liability company in the form of Erdene, and now MonAtom.”'*

121. According to the Respondents, by invoking the Law on State and Local Government Property

(“LSLP”), the Claimants are inviting the Tribunal to ignore the legal status of MonAtom under
the Company Law and MonAtom’s own charter in favour of the legal framework governing
state property in Mongolia. However, in the Respondents’ view, there is no reason why any of
the provisions of the LSLP would alter MonAtom’s legal character as “an independent limited

liability Mongolian company.”"*

122. Addressing the Claimants’ argument that if MonAtom is not a representative of Mongolia, the

142

E

145

5

2009 transfer of shares in CAUC from the SPC to MonAtom would be void due to failure to
comply with the requirements for transfer to a third party found at Article 11 of the Founding
Agreement, the Respondents state that this provision applies only to transfers “for a price,” and
not situations where one entity (MonAtom) succeeds to another (the SPC). Indeed, Article
11(1) of the Founding Agreement refers to the “price and terms upon which the Disposing
Member proposes to sell.” In any event, the Claimants recognize that they were notified by a

letter dated 4 June 2009 of the transfer of shares from the SPC to MonAtom.'°

Agreement would apply. This provision allows MonAtom to bring another entity into the joint venture to
replace CAUC Holding in the event CAUC Holding breaches the Minerals Agreement (Memorial, paras.

123. Finally, the Respondents submit that the International Law Commission Draft Articles on State

Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, while widely accepted as reflecting

customary international law, are not applicable to the present dispute.'"”

The Claimants’ position

124. The Claimants submit that MonAtom is not independent of Mongolia, as the Respondents

claim. Rather, as confirmed by the Tsogt Report, MonAtom is Mongolia’s representative in the

Founding Agreement.'**

125. In particular, the Claimants assert that: (i) MonAtom is Mongolia’s representative in the

(i)

specific context of the Founding Agreement; (ii) MonAtom, as an entity charged with holding
state property, acts at the behest of Mongolia pursuant to the LSLP; and (iii) if MonAtom were
indeed independent from Mongolia, the 2009 transfer of CAUC shares from the SPC to

MonAtom would be invalid.'”

MonAtom is Mongolia’s representative in the specific context of the Founding Agreement

126. The Claimants submit that MonAtom and its predecessors in the Founding Agreement (Erdene,

the MRAM, and the SPC) have always acted and have always viewed themselves as acting on
behalf of Mongolia. Thus, as apparent from numerous provisions of the Founding Agreement

and related contracts, “Mongolia is the ‘Mongolian party’ to the Founding Agreement.”!?

127. For instance, Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement provides that the property of the company

“will not be subject to requisition or confiscation.” As confirmed by the Tsogt Report and

Black’s Law Dictionary, “requisition” and “confiscation” are terms that apply uniquely to the

governmental actions.'*' Article 15.1 of the Founding Agreement also provides that all notices
are to be made “c/o Ministry of Energy, Geology and Natural Resources of Mongolia.”!*

128. The Claimants further submit that while they do not assert any claims under the Minerals

129. Specifically, the Minerals Agreement includes the undertaking by the “Mongolian Party” to
provide the joint venture with the “right to utilize mineral deposits,” as well as an assumption

of obligations regarding “questions of licensing, taxation, customs, royalties, and environmental
liabilities” that could only have been assumed by a sovereign, — i.e. Mongolia.'** The Minerals
Agreement also refers to Erdene’s acts “on behalf of the Ministry of Energy, Geology and

55

Mining Industry of Mongolia.

130. As for the Charter, it explains that the contribution of Erdene will be based on the reduction of
fees to be paid by CAUC for use of natural resources and may consist of “rights for the use of

19156

land, water, and other natural resources. Such contributions also could only be made by

Mongolia.'””

131. Furthermore, the Claimants assert that from 1995 to 2001, while Erdene held the CAUC shares,
the Government used Erdene and other governmental agencies interchangeably as its
representatives in CAUC. For instance, government officials signed official CAUC documents

on behalf of Erdene.'**

132. The Claimants further assert that, in 2001, the “Mongolian Party” shares in CAUC were
transferred to the MRAM, a government regulatory agency. The other shareholders of CAUC
accepted this transfer as merely a change in the designation of the government entity
responsible for Mongolia’s shares, and not as a formal sale of shares that would have needed to
comply with the restrictions on transfer provided under Article 11 of the Founding
Agreement.'”

133. Thus, when Khan first invested in CAUC in 2003, the MRAM was the “Mongolian Party” to
the Founding Agreement, and, as confirmed by the Edey Statement, Khan understood that the
Government was its partner in CAUC.'®

134. After Mongolia transferred the authority to represent it in CAUC from the MRAM to the SPC
in 2005, the SPC attempted to sell its shares in the joint venture to Khan Canada. The offer to

sell, as well as other correspondence exchanged by Khan Canada and the SPC, refer to the

SPC’s shares as “state-owned” and confirm that the SPC acted on behalf of Mongolia.'*' A
CAUC shareholders’ resolution passed on 31 October 2005 “to clarify the status of respective
interests in CAUC,” lists the shareholders of CAUC as: “Mongolia (the State) (through the
SPC),” Priargunsky, and CAUC Holding Company Ltd. The SPC’s signature of this resolution

demonstrates that it understood its role as proxy for Mongolia.'”

135. In 2006, the prospectus for the initial public offering of shares in Khan Canada on the Toronto

Stock Exchange confirmed Khan Canada’s belief that Mongolia was the owner of 21 percent of

the shares in CAUC.'®

136. In 2009, when the SPC’s shares were transferred to MonAtom, the shareholders were notified

that the “state shares held in CAUC ... that allow [. . .] to implement the right to represent the
state ha[ve] been transferred ....”'' Finally, shortly after the NEL came into effect, providing
that Mongolia’s share in all Mongolian entities which had been granted a license to explore or
exploit uranium in Mongolia was to reach 51 percent, MonAtom declared its status as the future
owner of Mongolia’s increased 51 percent interest in CAUC at the management board meeting

held on 4 November 2009.'°

137. In this connection, the Claimants argue that if MonAtom had been acting independently from

Mongolia, it would have transferred its shares back to a government agency such as the SPC.'®

138. The Claimants also note that Mongolian law recognizes “that civil transactions may be

concluded through a representative on the basis of an authorization” and that Mongolia, as the

principal, is responsible for MonAtom’s obligations under the Founding Agreement.'”

understood Mongolia to be a shareholder in the joint venture; and (iv) Mongolia understood

that it was a shareholder of CAUC.'®*

140. In addition, the Claimants submit that the Respondents incorrectly rely on Article 3.7 of the

Founding Agreement in support of their contention that “liability would not attach to
Mongolia.”'® In fact, as confirmed by the Tsogt Report, Article 3.7 only stands for the
proposition that Mongolia cannot be liable for the obligations of CAUC. Article 3.7 does not
limit Mongolia’s liability for breaching the Founding Agreement vis-a-vis other parties to the
Agreement. The Claimants argue further that the mention of Mongolia’s liability in the

Founding Agreement demonstrates that Mongolia was a party to the agreement.'”

(ii) | MonAtom is controlled by Mongolia pursuant to the LSLP

141. The Claimants submit further that, contrary to the Respondents’ contention, the fact that

MonAtom is a limited liability company does not contradict its role as representative of

Mongolia.’

Nevertheless, the Claimants “feel compelled to correct the Respondents’
mischaracterizations as to the general status of MonAtom under Mongolian law.”'” Thus,
while corporate entities may be independent of their shareholders under “general Mongolian
company law,” the Respondents overlook the “larger framework governing state entities . . .

charged with holding state property and executing state policies.”!”*

are state property.'”>

The LSLP grants the SPC, a state agency, the powers to “own, use, [and]
dispose” of state property, to “appoint state property representatives to legal persons with state
property”, and to “supervise the[. . .] activity” of such legal persons.'”° Accordingly, and as sole

MonAtom’s board of directors, as well as to dismiss MonAtom’s executive director.'””

143. Moreover, the LSLP provides that a “legal person with state property” such as MonAtom is

established by the state “with the purpose of implementing its policy and maintaining social

consumption,” thus further confirming MonAtom’s governmental purpose. '*

(iii) The 2009 transfer of shares in CAUC from the SPC to MonAtom

144. The Claimants submit that if MonAtom were acting independently of Mongolia, the 2009

transfer of CAUC shares from the SPC to MonAtom would be void and of no effect. The
Founding Agreement and Mongolian law both subject the transfer of shares in CAUC to any
third party entity to strict formalities and rights of pre-emption for the other shareholders in
CAUC.'” These formalities, including the compulsory written notice to the other shareholders
of CAUC, were not respected.'*” For instance, the letter dated 4 June 2009, referred to by the
Respondents, does not constitute sufficient notice, as it fails to provide any details regarding the

terms or price of the transaction and was not addressed to CAUC.'*!

145. In fact, the Claimants argue that Khan accepted the transfer of CAUC shares from the SPC to

MonAtom only because it was understood that MonAtom was representing Mongolia’s

interests.'*°

146. The Claimants reject as implausible the Respondents’ argument that the 2009 transaction

whereby shares in CAUC passed from the SPC to MonAtom did not trigger the transfer of
shares formalities merely because MonAtom “succeeded” the SPC as a shareholder in CAUC —
i.e. received the shares for free. As these are the same shares that Mongolia offered to sell Khan
Canada and Priargunsky for USD 30 million in 2005, it is unlikely the SPC would have been

willing to transfer them for free to MonAtom had MonAtom been an independent third party.'**

147. Furthermore, in the Claimants’ view, it is not a coincidence that this transfer of shares from a

17

178

179

180

181

182

183

independent from Mongolia, the transfer of shares from the SPC to MonAtom likewise is void.
In other words, Mongolia remains the responsible party under the Founding Agreement through

Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction ,@/ove mareriae over the claims brought under the
Founding Agreement

Khan’s breach of fiduciary duty claim

The Respondents’ position

148. The Respondents submit that pursuant to Article 12 of the Founding Agreement, the Tribunal

only has jurisdiction to hear claims “arising out of, or in connection with” provisions of the
Founding Agreement.'*° The Claimants have failed to establish a link between their claim of

breach of fiduciary duty and a specific obligation contained in the Founding Agreement.'*”

149. The Respondents also argue that given the Tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction ratione personae over

Mongolia, the only question as to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae is with respect to
claims against MonAtom. Yet, the Claimants’ claim of breach of fiduciary duty, as described in

the Notice of Arbitration and the Tsogt Report, is made exclusively against Mongolia.'**

150. Finally, the Respondents aver that the Claimants’ desire to enter into the 2010 MOU with

MonAtom and MonAtom’s cooperative behaviour in this context confirm that the Claimants
“do not and cannot have any” breach of fiduciary duty claims against MonAtom.'® Thus, the
Claimants are attempting to “use MonAtom as a mere vehicle to direct their claims against

Mongolia, which is not a party to the Founding Agreement.”'””

The Claimants’ position

152. In particular, the breach of fiduciary duty claim is based on Articles 81 and 82 of the Company

Law, which states that a “governing person” (i.e., Mongolia) in a Mongolian company shall be
personally liable to the company’s shareholders if such a person intentionally violates the
principle that requires it to “act in good faith and in CAUC’s interest.”'°? The breach of

fiduciary duty claim is also founded on Articles 227.1 and 497.1 of the Civil Code.'**

153. Addressing whether “the Claimants’ Notice of Arbitration stated legally cognizable claims

against the Respondents under the Founding Agreement,” The Tsogt Report on Mongolian law
states that if Mongolia illegally cancelled the Mining and Exploration Licenses in order to
“enter a new joint venture covering the same purpose as the CAUC joint venture, . . . then the
Government has breached its basic obligation to implement the business described in the
Founding Agreement.” As the principal, Mongolia is responsible for the acts of its

representatives Erdene, the MRAM, the SPC, and MonAtom.'”

154. Moreover, even if the Tribunal were to find that Mongolia is not a party to the Founding

Agreement, MonAtom still has breached its fiduciary duties “arising out of, or in connection

with” the Founding Agreement.'”°

155. In particular, MonAtom will participate in the new Russia-Mongolia joint venture which

“improperly and illegally displaces” Khan.'*” In this respect, the Claimants clarify that where
they referred to “Mongolia” in their submissions, they were referring to all the Respondents,

including MonAtom.'*

are governed by the Company Law. Thus, “[t]here can be no more fundamental claim than one
between joint venture partners for a failure to meet their fiduciary obligations to one

another.”2

Khan’s expropriation claims

The Respondents’ position

157. The Respondents submit that the Claimants have failed to establish a link between their

expropriation claims and the provisions of the Founding Agreement.””!

158. Specifically, the Respondents contend that the Claimants rely on the second sentence of Article

3.6 of the Founding Agreement to argue that there is a connection between their unlawful
expropriation claims under the Founding Agreement and the Foreign Investment Law.”” While
the Claimants construe Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement as having an effect similar to
that of an “expropriation provision, ” the Respondents contend that the wording of the clause

does not lend itself to such an interpretation."”*

159. Article 3.6 reads, in full:

“The Company will own, use, and dispose of its property in accordance with the laws of
Mongolia and consistent with the goals of its activities and the purposes of such property.
Property of the Company will not be subject to requisition or confiscation.”

160. In the Respondents’ view, this provision seeks to prevent CAUC’s founders and their

successors from using CAUC’s property (raw materials, machinery, and other assets) for
purposes other than those of the company, rather than to render Mongolia liable for state

expropriation of CAUC’s property."

161. In fact, Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement lacks “all of the essential elements” present in

expropriation clauses found in international investment treaties in general and in Mongolia’s

bilateral investment treaties in particular.”

162. The Respondents note in this respect that unlike Mongolia’s bilateral investment treaties, the

201

202

203,

204

205

206

Founding Agreement was not signed by a top-level government official.” The Respondents
also note that the two lines of Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement are significantly less
detailed than the expropriation clauses of, inter alia, the ECT, the seven bilateral investment

treaties signed by Mongolia in 1995, the year the Founding Agreement was concluded, the

recent investment agreement between Rio Tinto, Ivanhoe Mines, and Mongolia, and annex C of

the 2010 MOU.”

163. According to the Respondents, the entire purpose of the Founding Agreement significantly

differs from an investment agreement’s aim to provide foreign investors with guarantees such
as protection from expropriation. As is apparent from Article 2 of the Founding Agreement, its
purpose relates rather to the creation and management of a joint venture company intended to

generate profits for its members through the sale of minerals.”*

164. Article 3.7 of the Founding Agreement further excludes any possible liability of Mongolia by

stating that “the Government of Mongolia shall not be liable for the obligations of the
99209

Company.

165. The Respondents submit that the Claimants “knew on no uncertain terms” that a provision for

the protection of investments did not exist under the Founding Agreement.”'” That is why the
Claimants were keen to enter into an investment agreement with Mongolia which would

include such provisions, as was planned in the 2010 MOU.”"!

The Claimants’ position

166. The Claimants submit that the Respondents “have created a lengthy argument based on the

au

212

213,

214

straw man that Article 3.6 is not an expropriation clause such as the ones found in the [Foreign
Investment Law] or a BIT.”’"? In response, the Claimants state that they do not contend that
Article 3.6 is “precisely identical” to an expropriation provision in an investment treaty.’!*
Rather, Article 3.6 is a more expansive expropriation provision, protecting the investor from

wld

confiscation of property, including mining licenses, in “any circumstances.” ” This wide scope

makes “particular sense” in the context of a joint venture to which the Government is a party.”!*

167. In fact, Article 3.6 uses language “substantially identical” to the prohibition against

expropriation by the state found in Article 16(3) of the Constitution.’!° Moreover, in the context
of Mongolian law, the terms “confiscation” and “requisition,” found in Article 3.6 of the
Founding Agreement, specifically mean “‘a taking, or expropriation” by the Government and do
not describe a situation where one private party takes or misuses the property of another private

entity!”

168. The Claimants also argue that Article 3.7 of the Founding Agreement, which states that “the

Government will not be liable for the obligations of the Company,” is only an

provision does not absolve Mongolia from liability for its own breaches of the Founding

Agreement.”””

169. With respect to the Respondents’ argument that the Claimants would not have sought to enter

into a new investment agreement with Mongolia, as was provided in the 2010 MOU, if
investment protections already existed in the Founding Agreement, the Claimants argue that an
investment agreement serves to “update the relationship” between the Parties in light of new
circumstances and would, in addition to an expropriation clause, contain other desirable
elements, such as “tax stabilization, assurance of sale of products at international market prices,

amount and term of investment, guarantee of investor’s right of use, plus others.

The Respondents’ position

170. The Respondents submit that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction ratione materiae for “the

Founding Agreement claims under international law.”””' The Respondents emphasize that the
Claimants have failed to explain why international law should apply automatically to private

action.” In the present case, under Article 12.1(i) of the Founding Agreement, the intention of
the parties was to subject the Founding Agreement to Mongolian rather than international

law 224

Nor can it be concluded that general international law is directly incorporated into
Mongolian national law on the basis of Article 10(1) of the Constitution, as the Claimants
assert.” This provision merely states that Mongolia “adheres” to international law and can
only be interpreted as meaning that Mongolia respects international law toward other States.
The Claimants, by quoting different translations of this provision, show their “willingness to

99226

manipulate the wording of Article 10(1) to seek an effect that the clause cannot have.
The Claimants’ position

The Claimants submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione materiae over claims that
Mongolia breached its obligations toward the Claimants under general principles of
international law.’ The Claimants assert that, irrespective of whether “the proper law of the
Founding Agreement is local law,” Mongolia’s conduct in the exercise of its sovereign
authority in relation to foreign investors is governed by minimum international legal standards,
which include “non-expropriation without compensation, non-arbitrariness and non-abuse of
discretion.””* The fact that Mongolia undertook “sovereign obligations” under the Founding
Agreement and the other constitutive CAUC documents suggests that the Founding Agreement
“is properly subject to international law.””” Moreover, according to the Claimants, all organs of
international jurisdiction have the inherent power to refer to general principles of international
law, unless this power is expressly excluded from their competence. The Claimants submit that
the Tribunal is such an organ of international jurisdiction, given that the subject matter of the

dispute is “the treatment of foreign investors qua foreign investors.”””’ Further, a mere selection

of national law does not suffice to exclude the application of international law.”*!

The Claimants argue further that, whether Article 10(1) of the Constitution is read as being
mandatory with respect to adherence to international law (“‘shall adhere”) or as a statement of

recognition that Mongolian law adheres to international law (“Mongolia adheres”), and as

confirmed by the Mongolian Supreme Court’s resolution “On the Application of International
Treaties and Universally Recognized Norms and Principles of International Law in Judicial
Court Practice,” Mongolian law may not be interpreted or applied in a manner that falls below

the international minimum standard with respect to treatment of foreign investors.”

174. Finally, the Claimants submit that, in any event, the Tribunal can find that it has jurisdiction

over claims made under the Founding Agreement without having to determine whether
Mongolia is liable under international law for actions carried out in connection with the

Founding Agreement.”

THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION OVER KHAN NETHERLANDS’ CLAIMS UNDER
THE ECT™

Whether Khan Netherlands is prevented from bringing ECT claims due to its failure to
comply with Mongolian Law

The Respondents’ position

175. The Respondents submit that Khan Netherlands’ violations of Mongolian law deprive it of the

protection of the ECT, “regardless of whether these [violations] occurred before or after the
initial investment was made.”?* While admitting that the ECT is silent on the “necessary
compliance of an investment with the laws of the host state,” the Respondents cite the Plama
Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria award on the merits (“Plama Award on the Merits’) to argue
that the ECT’s substantive protections cannot apply to “investments that are made contrary to
law.””*° The Respondents also refer to the rationale for this rule as expressed in Phoenix: “[t]he

purpose of international protection is to protect legal and bona fide investments.””*”

176. According to the Respondents, this rationale applies in the same way to “an investment made

illegally as to an investment carried out illegally, as here, where the Claimants have conducted

themselves with flagrant disregard for national or international laws.”?**

177. The Respondents also submit that an interpretation of the ECT in accordance with its purpose

pursuant to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“WCLT”), which is
“to strengthen the rule of law on [e]nergy issues,” suggests that the ECT contains an implicit

obligation of “continued conformity of an investment with the law.”””

178. In the Respondents’ view, it is “impossible to consider” that the drafters and signatories of the

ECT would have intended to extend its protections to “investors, who, once their investment

has been made, chose to ignore a host state’s laws at [their] whim.”

179. The Respondents further submit that Khan Netherlands committed and failed to remedy upon

notification numerous regulatory breaches, which are detailed and substantiated in the reports

following the routine inspections carried out by the SSIA in 2005 and 2009."*'

180. The Respondents add that, contrary to the Claimants’ assertion, in ruling that the suspension of

the Exploration License was invalid on 2 August 2010, the Administrative Court did not make
any “substantive decision with respect to Khan’s regulatory breaches.””” The Respondents also
submit that the Claimants have breached Article 21.2.1 of the Law of Mongolia on Subsoil, as
no activities took place within three years from the granting of the Exploration License in the

relevant area, as required by the statute.”"*

181. Finally, the Claimants’ argument that the Respondents may not rely on Khan’s regulatory

breaches because these breaches form a central component of Khan’s claim on the merits in this
arbitration is “illogical,” as the Respondents are entitled at the jurisdictional stage to rely on any

facts relevant to jurisdiction, whether or not they have a bearing on the merits as well.”*

The Claimants’ position

182. The Claimants submit that the Respondents’ objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Khan

Netherlands’ ECT claims on the basis of alleged non-compliance with Mongolian law is

“manifestly frivolous.””**

183. The Claimants agree with the proposition that an investor seeking the protection of an

been “made contrary to law.”“° However, according to the Claimants, to deprive the investor of

the protection of the investment treaty, the violation of the law must be such that as a result “no

protected investment ha[s] ever come into existence.””"7

184. The Claimants state that “there is nothing whatsoever in the Plama and Phoenix decisions — or

in any other arbitral decision, for that matter — to suggest that a bona fide investor can be denied
access to arbitration by an international tribunal simply because its investment enterprise was

“cited (legitimately or otherwise) for any breach of law.”“*

185. The Claimants submit that the Respondents’ attempt to justify the assertion that “the very same

logic applies to an investment made illegally as to an investment carried out illegally” by
reference to the object and purpose of the ECT, in particular the “strengthening of the rule of
law on energy issues,” fails.” In the Claimants’ view, rules of interpretation, including the rule
that a treaty must be interpreted in good faith and in light of its object and purpose cannot be

used to fabricate a requirement that is absent from the text of the treaty.”

186. In any event, the object and purpose of the ECT would not be served by precluding any investor

who has allegedly breached the laws of the host state from making claims under the Treaty.
Such a rule would incentivize host state regulators to impose pretextual sanctions on foreign
investment enterprises as a means of avoiding arbitration under the ECT, running contrary to
the ECT’s goals of “promot[ing] long-term cooperation” and “strengthening . . . the rule of

law” in the energy field.”"'

187. The Claimants further note that the Respondents’ premise is not supported by any of the

principles of international law invoked in Plama, as these were all directed towards
circumstances where “the claims in question are based upon, arise from, or otherwise would not

exist in the absence of the claimant’s own illegal or non-bona fide acts.””**

jurisdiction. Yet, in the present case, the Respondents have “failed even to make a prima facie

showing that any Khan entity ever committed any breach of law.”?**

189. According to the Claimants, the Respondents refer to a single document, the July 2009 Report

issued by the SSIA, as evidence of Khan’s alleged regulatory breaches and in support of the
July 2009 suspension of the Mining License, the April 2010 revocation of the Mining and
Exploration Licenses, and the NEA’s subsequent refusal to re-register the Mining and

Exploration Licenses.

190. Yet, the Claimants assert, this report cannot be considered reliable evidence of regulatory

breaches, much less definitive evidence sufficient to sustain the Respondents’ burden of proof
on this issue at this stage of the proceedings.” On its face, the July 2009 Report does not
identify any facts or provide any legal analysis to substantiate the conclusions it sets forth. In
issuing it, the SSIA ignored both the “wealth of information” provided to it by CAUC and

Khan Mongolia during the inspections and Khan’s requests to meet again with the SSIA.?*°

191. Besides, the Claimants aver that the MRAM’s original reaction to the July 2009 Report was

contradictory, as it took no action against Khan Mongolia, informing the SSIA that its
conclusions were not legitimate grounds for cancelling a minerals license, while at the same

time suspending CAUC’s Mining License “pursuant to” the report.”””

192. In addition, the July 2009 Report was never notified to CAUC or Khan Mongolia, who were

therefore not afforded the opportunity to challenge the SSIA’s conclusions or remedy the
putative breaches.** Moreover, the July 2009 Report was “never verified, challenged or
confirmed through any proper administrative procedure.”’” In fact, the Administrative Court
ruled that the April 2010 invalidation of the Exploration License was illegal, stating that (i) “the
NEA had failed to implement its duty to monitor and control, inasmuch as it had never verified
any of the ‘breaches’ set out in the July 2009 Report” and (ii) “the July 2009 Report could not

provide a justifiable basis for the invalidation” of the Exploration License.*”

193. The Claimants emphasize that the Respondents have not sought to verify or otherwise prove the

allegations of the 2009 July Report, and in fact have failed even to address the “threshold”
issues pertaining to the report’s weight and credibility, such as the function of the SSIA, the
methods and reasons for the SSIA’s inspections, and the significance of the SSIA reports to

other government agencies as a matter of Mongolian law.”""

194. The Claimants acknowledge that the Respondents also “obliquely” referred to a 2005

inspection by the SSIA as alleged evidence of regulatory violations, but note that, as with the
July 2009 Report, the Respondents have failed to demonstrate the “relevance, credibility or
significance” of the only supporting document they invoke, a letter from the SSIA to CAUC
dated 25 April 2005.”° In any event, the Claimants consider that this letter has nothing to do

263

with Khan Mongolia or Khan Netherlands.

195. With regard to this letter, the Claimants note that it never led to any administrative action

against CAUC, which suggests that even if any alleged breaches did occur, they were remedied
by the company.” Administrative sanctions were imposed on CAUC only in 2009, after

“Russia and Mongolia launched their campaign to exclude Khan from the Dornod Project.””°°

196. The Claimants argue that the Respondents’ suggestion that Khan Mongolia somehow accepted

that it had violated Mongolian law in the context of the proceedings before the Administrative
Court by not challenging the sut of the SSIA’s lusions denotes a misunderstandin,

of the purpose of Khan Mongolia’s action before the Administrative Court.

197. Specifically, Khan Mongolia sought to challenge the validity of the administrative act of the

261

262

263

264

265

266

267

NEA purporting to invalidate the Exploration License, not to investigate issues — such as the

198. The Claimants also submit that they are “confused” by the Respondents’ “sudden and startling”

allegation in their Reply that by failing to engage in any activities in the three years that

followed issuance of the Exploration License, Khan Mongolia breached Article 21.2.1 of the

Law of Mongolia on Subsoil.””

The allegation of a breach of this provision was not mentioned
in the Respondents’ prior pleadings, and Khan Mongolia was never cited for such a breach. In
any event, the Claimants submit that in fact Khan carried out an extensive drilling program in

the area covered by the Exploration License during the relevant period.”

199. Finally, the Claimants submit that denying them access to arbitration on the basis of the very

same allegations of regulatory breaches challenged by them as a central component of their

claim on the merits would lead to “absurd and unacceptable results.

202. Article 26(2)(a) refers to the resolution of disputes by “the courts or administrative tribunals of

the Contracting Party party to the dispute.” According to the Respondents, as Mongolia was
listed in Annex ID of the ECT when the Claimants filed the Notice of Arbitration, Mongolia
had “clearly” not given “its unconditional consent to arbitrate where the dispute has already
been referred to its courts or administrative tribunals.”’”* Mongolia’s intention to withhold such
unconditional consent is further emphasized by its written statement of policies, practices, and

conditions provided in accordance with Article 26(3)(b)(ii).?”*

203. To determine whether the dispute submitted to international arbitration has already been

“referred to . . . courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party,” the Respondents

champion the “fundamental basis” test, while rejecting the “restrictive” “triple identity” test

276

proposed by the Claimants.” At the hearing, the Respondents acknowledged that the “triple

identity” test’s criteria are not met in this case.”””

However, according to the Respondents, the
three requirements of the triple identity test — identity of parties, cause, and object — combine to
rob Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT of “any practical effect.”?”* The Respondents explain that
this “practical ineffectiveness” of the triple identity test is noted by numerous commentators,
who have proposed to replace it by the fundamental basis test, a “more appropriate test” that
grants “practical meaning” to fork in the road provisions in investment treaties.”” In applying
the fundamental basis test, the Tribunal must examine “whether the ‘fundamental basis’ of a
claim is autonomous of claims heard in other fora” and “whether the substance of the factual

complaint is the same.”**

The fundamental basis test was applied in Pantechniki
S.A.Contractors and Engineers v. Republic of Albania (“Pantechniki’), with reference to the
Woodruff Case (“Woodruff”) and Compaiiia de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal

v. Argentine Republic (“Vivendi”).”*' According to the Respondents, the Pantechniki tribunal

held that, in that case, “the arbitration concerned a claim which, although brought on a different

legal basis to the court applications, was brought on the same fundamental basis as the court

cases.”"*? This precluded jurisdiction as a result of the fork in the road provision of the bilateral

investment treaty invoked.”**

204. The Respondents assert that the two proceedings initiated by Khan Mongolia and CAUC

respectively before the Administrative Court in April 2010 satisfy the fundamental basis test
and thus trigger the application of Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT.** The Respondents explain
that the claims were brought by Khan Mongolia and CAUC on behalf of the same entities who
are the Claimants in this arbitration. While this arbitration and the proceedings before the

Administrative Court do not have the “exact same legal bases,” “the bases of the claims” are

the same in both instances, as both are based on the “same alleged conduct of Mongolia, i.e. the

invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses. 5 Thus, before the Administrative Court,
the Claimants sought “a declaration of the Court that the NEA’s purported action to invalidate
the mining licenses was itself invalid.””*° Similarly, in the present arbitration, the Claimants
argue for an award on the basis of, inter alia, the Respondents’ alleged “illegal invalidation of
the mining and exploration licenses.”"*” While the Claimants argue that no ECT claims were
invoked before the Administrative Court, the Respondents submit that the Claimants’ “ECT

claims do not exist independently of their contractual claims.”***

205. The Respondents also argue that Article 25 of the Foreign Investment Law specifically grants

Mongolian courts jurisdiction over disputes such as this one.” The Respondents add that the

Claimants multiply their legal proceedings to “put pressure” on Mongolia.”

206. In addition, the Respondents contend that the Claimants’ arguments are internally

contradictory. Thus, while arguing that the case before the Administrative Court did not involve
any alleged ECT breach, the Claimants simultaneously argue that the mention of “Khan

Mongolia having suffered illegality and injustice at the hands of the NEA (in the [Letter to the

that the proceedings before the Administrative Court and this Tribunal are distinct, they also

invoke the Administrative Court proceedings as evidence in this arbitration.”
The Claimants’ position

The Claimants submit that the limitation contemplated in Article 26(3)(b) of the ECT has not
been triggered, regardless of the applicable set of criteria, as the present dispute between Khan

Netherlands and Mongolia has not been submitted to any other forum.”

With respect to the administrative action filed by CAUC, the Claimants indicate that the
Respondents have failed to explain how an action filed by CAUC could trigger the ECT fork in

the road provision vis-a-vis Khan Netherlands.”

As for the administrative action filed by Khan Mongolia, it did not involve “the same parties,
the same legal claims, the same subject matter, the same relief requested, the same underlying

facts or the same ‘fundamental bases’” as the present proceeding.””*

The Claimants find inexplicable the Respondents’ assertion that “the ECT claims do not exist
independently of their contractual claims, as the same arguments could have been made before

the Mongolian Courts.””° According to the Claimants, none of the claims brought before the
Administrative Court were based on contract and neither Khan Netherlands nor Khan Mongolia

is a party to any contract with Mongolia.”

The Claimants submit that the Respondents have not provided any “substantive information” or
“reasoned analysis” of any similarity between the administrative proceedings and this
arbitration.’ The Claimants note that even if there were any such similarity, the Claimants are

not “unsatisfied” with the Administrative Court’s decisions, as the Respondents allege, but

rather with the conduct of Mongolia, which has refused to recognize or take any action based

on the Administrative Court’s decision.”

212. The Claimants argue that to determine whether any other tribunal has previously considered the

“dispute” in this arbitration, the Tribunal should first consider the definition of “dispute” in
Article 26(1) of the ECT. This provision refers to three elements: “parties (“between a
Contracting Party and an Investor’); subject matter (‘relating to an Investment’); and legal
grounds (‘concerning an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III of the
ECT’). As the proceeding brought by Khan Mongolia against the NEA before the
Administrative Court involved neither a breach of the ECT, nor an “Investor” for purposes of
the ECT, this proceeding did not pertain to the same “dispute” as the one presently before the

. 3
Tribunal.*”’

213. The Claimants further allege that the ECT’s definition of a “dispute” largely reflects what is

known as the “triple identity” test, which requires an identity of parties, legal grounds, and
subject matter or, in its only distinction from the ECT’s definition of a dispute, relief.*” The
Claimants submit that the Tribunal should accept the triple identity test, because its relevance to
the application of fork in the road provisions such as Article 26(3)(b) of the ECT and to Article

19303

26(3)(b) itself is “supported by the weight of arbitral authority.

requirements of Mongolian law.”” All the facts underlying the complaint revolved around the

notifications and resolutions issued by the NEA.*°°

Furthermore, the Administrative Court identified the legal bases for its conclusions as Articles
26.3, 26.4, and 26.5 of the NEL, and Articles 1 and 2 of the Law on Regulation for
Implementation of Nuclear Energy Law.” The Administrative Court made no determination as

to whether the NEA’s actions breached any investor protection standards.*””

By contrast, in the present arbitration, the Tribunal does not need, and is not empowered, to
determine whether the NEA’s invalidation of the Exploration License was in violation of

The NEA’s breach of Mongolian law would

constitute no more than one of the many facts evidencing Mongolia’s violation of its

obligations under Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT.”

Indeed, the primary relevance to this arbitration of the decisions of the Administrative Court is
that Mongolia chose to disregard them, thus showing that its actions were not motivated by
legitimate regulatory concerns, but were “simply an illegal taking of [the] Claimants’

Fs 13
investments.”*"°

In addition, the Claimants observe that the relief requested of the Administrative Court and this

Tribunal is different.’!’

Before the Administrative Court, Khan Mongolia requested a
declaration that the NEA’s actions were invalid as a matter of Mongolian law. In contrast,
before this Tribunal, Khan Netherlands is requesting compensation for the total loss of its

The Claimants acknowledge that the Respondents rely on three international decisions,
Woodruff, Vivendi, and Pantechniki, to argue for the use of a “fundamental basis” test in the
application of Article 26(3)(b) of the ECT. However, according to the Claimants, the cited

cases do little to support the Respondents’ argument.*"*

PCA Case No. 2011-09

Decision on Jurisdiction
First, the Claimants specify that Woodruff, a 1903 decision of the U.S.-Venezuela Mixed
Claims Commission concerning Venezuela’s failure to re-pay bonds issued under a concession
agreement, stands for the proposition that “where a claim brought on the international plane is
‘fundamentally based on a [domestic law] contract,’ an exclusive forum selection clause in that
contract should be respected - although without prejudice to the right to pursue further

remedies based on causes of action in international law.”*\*

The Claimants further observe that in Vivendi, the tribunal’s dismissal of the claims on the
merits because the adjudication of those claims would violate the exclusive jurisdiction clause
of the underlying concession agreement was annulled by an ICSID annulment committee
decision. In doing so, the annulment committee invoked the “fundamental basis” test not in the
context of a fork in the road provision, but rather to “dispel the notion that the mere existence

of a contractual forum selection clause could preclude investment treaty arbitration.”*!*

Vivendi also stands for the proposition that fork in the road provisions are triggered where
(i) jurisdiction under the treaty is not limited to claims for treaty breaches; and (ii) the disputes

in the national and international fora are “coextensive.”*!°

In this respect, the Claimants contend that jurisdiction under the ECT is certainly limited to
claims based on breaches of the Treaty. Further, the issues before the Administrative Court and
this Tribunal are not coextensive. Thus, this Tribunal must not determine the legality of the
NEA’s conduct under Mongolian law, but rather whether Mongolia’s “disregard for the
Administrative Court’s ruling and its subsequent development of the Dornod Project” breached

317

Mongolia’s obligations under the ECT.

Finally, the Claimants note that Pantechniki, an ICSID case concerning money owed by
Albania under a contractual provision, is the only decision mentioned by the Respondents or
known to the Claimants to employ the “fundamental basis” test in the context of a fork in the
road provision.*'* In that case, the Albanian courts had already dismissed the investor’s claims,
and the investor resorted to arbitration under the Greece-Albania bilateral investment treaty

“rather than [pursuing] an appeal in Albania.”*"”

PCA Case No. 2011-09

Decision on Jurisdiction

225. The Claimants argue that the sole arbitrator in Pantechniki based his decision that he lacked
jurisdiction on the fact that Albania’s failure to comply with a contractual provision, which had
already been declared to be null by the Albanian courts, was the only conduct identified by the
claimant as capable of constituting a breach of the relevant investment treaty. In this case,
however, Khan Netherlands’ claims are not based on Mongolia’s breach of a domestic law

32
contract.”

226. Additionally, unlike the investor in Pantechniki, Khan Netherlands is not seeking the same

remedy before the national and international tribunals.*”'

227. In sum, the Claimants state that “this arbitration is based on fundamentally different legal
claims and a factual predicate that goes far beyond the limited procedural issues before the

322

Administrative Court. The factual basis for Khan Netherlands’ claims of ECT violations
before this Tribunal is based on Mongolia’s pursuit of a joint venture with Russian interests to
develop the Dornod Project without the Claimants, and the Government’s related decision to
invalidate and refuse to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses, to disregard the 2010
MOU, to disseminate false information about Khan Netherlands, and finally to disregard the
decision of the Administrative Court. By contrast, the factual basis for Khan Mongolia’s claim
before the Administrative Court consisted of the NEA’s failure to comply with the
requirements of administrative due process in formulating its notifications to Khan Mongolia.*”*
Consequently, the fundamental basis test, to the extent that the Tribunal finds it relevant, is not

sopead : 3
satisfied in the present case."

228. In addition, the Claimants argue that even if the dispute before this Tribunal were the same as
the one before the Administrative Court, Mongolia’s disregard for that court’s decision
nonetheless constitutes an independent basis for Khan Netherlands to pursue a treaty claim

325

against Mongolia under the ECT.

229. The Claimants add that the Mongolian statement of policies provided with respect to Annex ID

of the ECT does not support the Respondents’ fork in the road objection.’”°

230. Finally, the Claimants assert that the Respondents “have conceded their objection under ECT

Article 26(3)(b)(i)” in their Reply, as they did not attempt to rebut any of the Claimants’
submissions regarding the application of this provision and did not challenge the Claimants’
submission that the fundamental basis test is not satisfied in this case.” In particular, by not
contesting and in part even confirming the Claimants’ characterization of the proceeding
brought by Khan Mongolia before the Administrative Court, the Respondents have conceded
that the fundamental basis of the claims brought by Khan Mongolia before the Administrative
Court was completely different from the fundamental basis of the claims presently before the

Tribunal.”

Whether Khan Netherlands has complied with the waiting period requirement of Article
26(2) of the ECT

The Respondents’ position

231. The Respondents submit that the Tribunal should decline jurisdiction because Khan

Netherlands has not made any valid attempt to settle the dispute amicably and has thus failed to

329

comply with the procedure set forth in Article 26 of the ECT.

232. Article 26(1) and (2) of the Treaty provides:

(dd) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating
to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of
an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a
period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested
amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for

resolution:
(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute;
(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or
(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.

233. The Respondents submit that, as confirmed by numerous arbitral tribunals, in stipulating a

three-month waiting period following the request to settle the dispute amicably, Article 26(2) of
the ECT creates a jurisdictional, rather than “merely” procedural, requirement, failure to

comply with which deprives the tribunal of jurisdiction.*”

narrow” interpretation to the effect that Article
26(2) of the Treaty only requires disputes to be settled amicably “if possible” is a “gross
underestimation” of the importance of the waiting period and a “miscomprehension” of the

Treaty’s object and purpose.**!

235. According to the Respondents, Article 2 of the ECT identifies one of the Treaty’s aims as the

promotion of cooperation. In this context, cooperation implies that parties must attempt to settle
a dispute amicably despite the complexity of the dispute and the unforeseeability of the
outcome of the amicable dispute resolution process.*** Moreover, the Respondents assert that,
in the present case, there was no sign that Mongolia would have willfully refused to

soe 333
negotiate.”

236. The Respondents also submit that the Claimants did not comply with the mandatory waiting

period of three months from the request to settle the dispute amicably.’ Contrary to the
Claimants’ assertion, the Letter to the Prime Minister did not trigger the three-month period, as
it does not constitute the request for amicable settlement contemplated by Article 26 of the

ECT, lacking the necessary elements of such a request set out in Article 26(1).***

237. First, the letter does not relate to an “Investor of another Contracting Party.” Sent by Khan

Canada, it contains no mention of Khan Netherlands.**° Second, the letter makes no mention of
any disputes “which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the [Contracting Party] under
Part III [of the Treaty].”**’ The letter concerns exclusively breaches of Mongolian law, rather
than Mongolia’s alleged ECT breaches. Yet, in Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of
Ecuador (“Burlington”), the tribunal stated that a dispute under a treaty “only arises once an
allegation of [t]reaty breach is made” and found that the applicable six-month waiting period

would begin only at that point in time.*** Third, the letter did not attempt to settle the dispute

amicably. It contained neither offers to negotiate nor any suggestion of a potential settlement.*”
Instead, the letter was “aggressive[. . .]” and “threatening,” reflecting the Claimants’ policy of
negative publicity and intimidation against the Respondents.” In fact, the Claimants publicized
the letter on their website and, on the very day it was sent, commenced proceedings against the

NEA in the Mongolian courts.*!

The Claimants’ position

238. The Claimants submit that far from seeking to disregard the requirements of Article 26 of the

Treaty, they have actually complied with that provision.»

239. The Claimants argue that given the stipulation in Article 26(1) that disputes shall be settled

amicably “if possible” and the conditional language of Article 26(2), the relevant inquiry for
purposes of these provisions is whether the dispute in question can or cannot be settled

amicably.*“*

240. Moreover, according to the Claimants, the ECT, unlike some other investment treaties, does not

require a formal, written, specific, notice of a dispute, but only a good faith “request” for

decisions, given the ordinary meaning of the word “request,” the investor need only make its

problems known to the host state’s decision-makers and ask that they be resolved.“

241. The Claimants further submit that they complied with the requirements of Article 26(1) and (2)

339

by sending the Letter to the Prime Minister on 15 April 2010. The letter refers to the “ongoing
unlawful and unjust actions being taken by the Nuclear Energy Agency,” including the NEA’s
purported invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses, and specifically requests the

Prime Minister of Mongolia to “exercise [his] authority to review and overturn the NEA’s

“offering apparently negotiation” (Hearing Transcript 23:6-24:5).

actions.”

242. Moreover, the Letter to the Prime Minister mentions that Mr. Quick, Khan Canada’s President
and CEO, “would appreciate an opportunity to speak directly” with the Prime Minister of
Mongolia or his staff.“ In the Claimants’ view, the fact that this letter was sent on Khan
Canada’s letterhead does not vitiate its character as a request for amicable settlement between
Khan Netherlands and the Respondents, as Khan Canada represented the interests of all its

wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Khan Netherlands and Khan Mongolia.”

243. According to the Claimants, Mongolia was well aware of Khan Netherlands’ interest in the
issues canvassed in the Letter to the Prime Minister, as the FIFTA was informed of Khan
Netherlands’ majority ownership of Khan Mongolia in May 2008, and as this ownership was

set forth in the 2010 MOU. **

244. Moreover, a request for amicable settlement under the ECT need not refer to specific breaches
of the Treaty. The Burlington case invoked by the Respondents was concerned with a treaty
that did not condition submission to arbitration on an attempt to settle the dispute amicably, but
only on the passing of six months. Thus, Burlington did not analyze the question of whether a
request for amicable settlement must contain allegations of treaty breach. As for Burlington’s
wider proposition that a dispute “only arises once an allegation of [t]reaty breach is made,” it is
contrary to the weight of authority on the question, as evidenced by the Maffezini v. Spain

ne’
decision.”

245. In any event, seen in its full context, this phrase from Burlington does not support the
conclusion that the Claimants have failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 26 of the ECT.
In fact, the Burlington tribunal specified that an investor should not be required “to spell out its
legal case in detail . . . [or] even . . . to invoke specific [t]reaty provisions . . .” but need only

“apprize the host State of the likely consequences that would follow should the negotiation

process break down.”*”” The Letter to the Prime Minister did just that by informing Mongolia

of the possibility of resort to international arbitration.

The Claimants also recall that after the Letter to the Prime Minister, numerous further efforts
were made to achieve an amicable settlement, including three trips to Mongolia by Khan

; , . 352
Canada’s officers and directors.**

The Claimants submit that since an amicable dispute resolution provision aims to allow parties
to engage in good faith negotiations, such a provision cannot preclude the Tribunal from having

jurisdiction where any further attempts at negotiation would have been futile.**

In the present case, based on the lack of positive response to any of Khan’s efforts to achieve an
amicable settlement and the “larger set of circumstances surrounding the claims before the
Tribunal,” it was clear that amicable settlement of Khan Netherlands’ dispute with Mongolia

. a3
was impossible.**

The Claimants submit that the Respondents adduce no evidence in support of their assertion to
the contrary. In particular, the Respondents fail to give any explanation for the “obvious”
questions arising in this connection, such as why Mongolia refused to honor the 2010 MOU and
the decisions of the Administrative Court; why the NEA sent an inflammatory letter concerning
Khan to the Toronto Stock Exchange in March 2010; why no Mongolian official ever
responded to the Letter to the Prime Minister; why Mr. Edey was advised that an amicable
resolution would be difficult to achieve given Mr. Enkhbat’s opposition to Khan’s participation
in the Dornod Project; why Mr. Enkhbat publicly insulted Khan and stated that it would never
get its licenses and; why Mongolia entered into an agreement with Russia for the development

of the Dornod Project, even as the Claimants remained the project’s legitimate owners.”

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction

Whether Khan Netherlands’ claims are barred by operation of Article 17(1) of the ECT
The Respondents’ position

The Respondents submit that Article 17(1) of the ECT, its denial of benefits provision, applies
in the present case to exclude the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Khan Netherlands’ claims under

the ECT.*°
Article 17(1) of the ECT provides, in relevant part:

“Each Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of ... Part [III of the Treaty]
to:

(1) a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such entity and if that

entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is

organized...”
According to the Respondents, given the Treaty’s purpose to “foster mutual cooperation for the
benefit of the signatories to the Treaty,” the aim of Article 17(1) of the Treaty is that ECT
benefits be awarded to “genuine nationals of contracting party states,” but denied to “investors
which ha[ve] no real connection with a Contracting Party, even if technically they [are]

organized within one of those contracting states,” the so-called “mailbox companies.”**”

The Respondents submit that if they can show that Khan Netherlands is a mailbox company
within the meaning of Article 17(1) of the ECT, i-e., that (i) “nationals of a third state own or
control” Khan Netherlands and (ii) Khan Netherlands “has no substantial business activities” in
the Netherlands, then Mongolia may deny Khan Netherlands the advantages of Part III of the
Treaty in this arbitration.** This denial also includes denial of the advantages of Article 26 of
the ECT because this provision, invoked as the jurisdictional basis of Khan Netherlands’ ECT

359

claims, applies only to alleged breaches of Part III of the ECT.

The Respondents acknowledge that recent arbitral decisions are inconclusive regarding the
application of Article 17(1) of the ECT. Of the four recent “notable” decisions on this matter,
two, namely, the Plama Consortium v. Bulgaria (“Plama’’) and Yukos Universal Limited (Isle
of Man) v. the Russian Federation (““Yukos’’) decisions on jurisdiction, have found that the right

to deny the benefits of the ECT must be exercised actively by the host state and with

exclusively prospective effect, ie., before the investment is made and the arbitration
361
commenced.

255. Addressing the Treaty’s “object and purpose” to “promote long-term co-operation in the energy

field” and investors’ “legitimate expectations” of enjoying the advantages of Part III of the ECT
unless the state exercises its right to deny ECT benefits under Article 17(1) of the Treaty, the
Plama tribunal explained that under this interpretation, the putative investor would receive
“reasonable notice” of a potential host state’s decision to exercise its right under Article 17(1),
and hence be able to “come within or without the criteria there specified, as it chooses” or “plan

not to make an investment at all or to make it elsewhere.”*”

256. By contrast, the other two decisions concerning the interpretation of Article 17(1) of the ECT,

Petrobart Limited v. Kyrgyz Republic (“Petrobart”) and Amto, directly proceeded to consider
whether on the facts of the case the relevant entity fell within the description of Article 17(1) of
the ECT, “on the basis that the benefits would be denied if the conditions of Article 17 were
fulfilled,”*® “as if the exercise of the [host state’s] right [to deny benefits] could be made upon
the exercise of the investor’s rights, that is, at the outset of the arbitration.”* In Amto, as in
Plama, the tribunal examined the purpose of the ECT, but attached a particular significance to
the reciprocal nature of the ECT and to the reference to “complementarities” and “mutual

benefits” in the expression of the Treaty’s objective in its Article 2.°°

257. The Respondents submit that the legal commentary is “almost unanimous[]” in criticizing the

362

366

interpretation of Article 17(1) of the ECT adopted in Plama and Yukos.”” According to the
Respondents, the requirement of prior notification contradicts a plain reading of Article 17(1)
of the Treaty, as this provision makes no mention of specific notice.” In fact, where the

“authors of the [Treaty] wished to subordinate the exercise of rights to conditions of form, they

formulated them explicitly.”** It is also contended that Article 17(1) itself constitutes sufficient

«3
notice.”

258. The Respondents add that commentators consider Plama’s reference to the Treaty’s purpose as

“fallacious” and “one-sided.”*”” For instance, in quoting the Treaty’s purpose as expressed in its
Article 2, the tribunal in Plama omits the words “complementarities and mutual benefits,” thus

ignoring the “reciprocal elements of the [Treaty].”°”!

259. Moreover, the Respondents observe that the view that the exclusively prospective effect of the

denial of benefits is necessary to protect the legitimate expectations of investors is criticized,
because “a company controlled by nationals of a third state and which has no activity in the

state in which it is incorporated has no legitimate expectation of protection under the Treaty.”*”*

260. Finally, the Plama interpretation has “utterly impractical consequences,” as it imposes on the

host state the obligation to review “every corporate structure, down to its smallest of
subsidiaries and empty mailbox companies that may be contained somewhere within the
investors’ group, of every investment that is made within its territory” if it wishes to avail itself

of its rights under Article 17(1) of the ECT.*”

261. In addition, the Respondents submit that the Claimants’ interpretation of Article 17(1) of the

Treaty, derived from the Plama and Yukos decisions, runs contrary to the rules of treaty

interpretation found at Article 31 of the VCLT.**

With respect to the “ordinary meaning” of
Article 17(1) of the ECT, the Respondents assert that the statement that a state “reserves the
right to” deny benefits does not suggest that any further action is necessary to exercise the

denial of benefits.”

262. This meaning of “to reserve a right” is confirmed by the Oxford English Dictionary, numerous

commentators, and the French and Spanish versions of the Treaty.” The heading of Article

17(1) of the ECT and Part C(2)(11) of the ECT Reader’s Guide also indicate that the denial of

benefits is not an option.*” By contrast, where the authors of other treaties wished to subject the
use of a denial of benefits clause to prior notice, they inserted an explicit compulsory
requirement of notification, as in Article 1113(2) of the North-American Free Trade Agreement

and Article 18(2) of the 2004 Canada Model BIT.**

263. Regarding the object and purpose of the ECT, the Respondents submit that their interpretation

does not “incentivize states to be non-transparent in their implementation of ECT policies”
contrary to the Treaty’s goal to create “stable, equitable, favorable and transparent conditions

for Investors,” because investors are on notice by virtue of Article 17(1) of the ECT, as

explained above.” Rather, it is the Claimants’ position that incentivizes investors to be non-
transparent by keeping “quiet about the structure of their investment.” **°

264. Finally, with respect to “subsequent practice,” the Respondents highlight that whereas the

Claimants assert that states may exercise their right under Article 17(1) of the ECT by making a
“blanket” denial of advantages towards all companies caught by the provision’s definition,
tellingly the Claimants have not identified a single blanket denial of this sort.’ In any event,

such a blanket denial would constitute a “reservation” prohibited by Article 46 of the Treaty.**

265. In their Memorial, the Respondents state that the preferred view of legal commentators and the

377

378,

379

380

one that should be adopted by the Tribunal is that the host state’s right to deny ECT benefits
can be exercised at the start of any dispute, when the state becomes aware of a mailbox
company investor that is attempting, despite being controlled by nationals of a non-ECT

Contracting Party, to obtain the advantages of the Treaty.***

At the hearing, the Respondents
explained that where the two conditions of Article 17(1) (ownership or control by nationals of a
third state and lack of substantial business activities in the state of incorporation) are met,
Article 17(1) provides “directly for the non-application” of Part III of the Treaty, without
requiring that the state take any “additional action to deny benefits” and without any “temporal

limits” on the exercise of the state’s right to deny benefits.***

266. The Respondents further submit that, in the present case, the Tribunal is “faced with the

application of Article 17(1) to the exact situation for which it was designed.”*** In particular,
the Respondents assert that the Claimants have admitted that Khan Netherlands is owned and
controlled by nationals of a third state - Canada — which is not party to the ECT, and that Khan
Netherlands is a “mailbox” company, with “no substantial business activities in the Area of the
Contracting Party in which it is organized.”*** As a result, the Tribunal is faced with an entirely
new question, as all the above-referenced decisions concerning the operation of Article 17(1)
were ultimately decided on the basis that one or the other of the two factual conditions of

Article 17(1) was not met.**”

267. Moreover, the Respondents submit that even if Article 17(1) of the ECT is interpreted to

require an active denial of benefits, in the present case Mongolia has not had a “realistic
opportunity” to exercise its right to deny ECT benefits. This is because Khan Netherlands was
created and inserted into the Claimants’ corporate structure after the Claimants had been
notified of their breaches of Mongolian regulations and coinciding with the Claimants’ negative
publicity campaign against the Respondents.*** Moreover, Khan Netherlands was given a “low

. woe 3
profile” even after its incorporation.*”

268. The Respondents argue, therefore, that if the Claimants’ approach to Article 17(1) of the ECT

were taken, Mongolia would be faced with the “impossible task” not only of examining the
corporate structure of every investment made in its territory, but also of constantly monitoring

wou. 3
changes in this structure.”

269. Furthermore, the Respondents submit that Article 17(1) was drafted specifically to avoid the

390)

benefit of the Treaty being extended to an entity such as Khan Netherlands, which was created

in the lead up to this arbitration as a “cynical attempt” or “subterfuge” to allow Khan Canada, a

Memorial, paras. 242-249, 252; Reply, para. 273. At the hearing, the Respondents explained that while Khan
Netherlands may have been registered in Mongolia in May 2008, “this is not the same people in the
government who are dealing with this registration process” (Hearing Transcript 88:2-5). The Respondents
emphasized that no mention of Khan Netherlands was made to the NEA or the Mongolian Ministry of
Energy and Mines between 2008 and 2010 and that even in the Letter to the Prime Minister, Khan
Netherlands was not named (Hearing Transcript 88:6-89:9).

Canadian entity, to obtain the benefit of the ECT, despite the fact that Canada has not adhered

to the Treaty.”

270. Among “further notable elements,” the Respondents stress that the investment was made

without any involvement by Khan Netherlands, which was incorporated only in 2007, after the
Claimants’ alleged investments in Mongolia.” It is thus “misleading” for the Claimants to
assert that if “capital could not have been channeled through a Dutch company, it may never

have been invested in the first place.”*”*

271. In addition, the Respondents contend that the Claimants are incorrect in stating that mailbox

companies have been led to expect to receive the protections of Part III of the ECT by reason of
the Treaty’s wide definition of “investor.” ** The Claimants’ reading of the ECT is “myopic,”
as it “surgically remov[es]” Article 17(1) from the ECT.*° In fact, Article 17(1) is an

exception to the definition of “investor” found in Article 1(7) of the Treaty.*”°

272. Accordingly, investors can plan their investments on the basis of the notice given by Article

17(1) that if they fall within the definition of this provision, they may not rely on the

397

protections of the ECT.” Wide definitions of “investor” have been coupled with denial of

398

benefits clauses in other instruments, such as the 2004 US Model BIT.” A state is free to limit

its consent to arbitration in a treaty, and the investor may “accept or decline the offer to

arbitrate, but cannot vary its terms.”*”

273. Thus, the Respondents’ interpretation of Article 17(1) of the ECT does not create any injustice

for the investor. In order to benefit from the ECT, the investor can always structure its activities
so as to have “substantial” business activities in a Contracting Party.“ Nor does it make any
sense to argue, as the Claimants do, that Mongolia’s intentions in signing the ECT can be

inferred from the Netherlands-Mongolia BIT, as there is no reason to believe that a state wishes

to engage itself in the same way toward one other state by means of a BIT as toward an

unlimited number of states by way of a unilateral treaty.“”"

274. The Claimants are also incorrect in suggesting that the Netherlands has a vested interest in

gaining international protection for mailbox companies, in particular Special Financial
Institutions. In fact, multiple sources note that Special Financial Institutions do not contribute

substantially to the Dutch economy.“

275. Finally, the Claimants are incorrect in claiming that investors and states should be expected to

act in accordance with arbitral decisions, and in particular that Mongolia should have

conformed with Plama and Yukos, as there is no doctrine of precedent in international

403

arbitration.” In fact, the authority of an arbitral tribunal’s decision is limited to the parties

which have agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration; the arbitral decision cannot have any

impact on parties not bound by the arbitration agreement.“

276. Even if it were accepted that states should form policy on the basis of arbitral decisions, this

reasoning is inapplicable to the present case, in the absence of an accepted line of authority
existing at the relevant time. When Khan Netherlands was created in 2007 and when the
Claimants’ claims crystallized sometime in or around October 2009, of the three decisions
considering Article 17(1) of the ECT, two, namely, Petrobart and Amto, supported the
Respondents’ interpretation, and the third, Plama, had been criticized by legal commentators.
The Yukos decision, which the Claimants state confirms the reasoning in Plama, had not yet

been rendered.“

The Claimants’ position

277. The Claimants submit that Mongolia cannot at this stage deny Khan Netherlands the

401

402

403

404

405

advantages of Part III of the ECT with regard to its pre-existing investments pursuant to Article
17(1) of the Treaty. At the outset, the Claimants highlight that Article 26 of the ECT,
concerning dispute settlement, is not included in Part III of the ECT and thus falls outside the

scope of Article 17(1). For this reason, the interpretation of Article 17(1) is not a question of

jurisdiction.”” Nonetheless, the Claimants note that the Parties have agreed to resolve the

applicability of Article 17(1) of the ECT in this preliminary phase.“””

278. The Claimants state that whether Mongolia’s right to deny benefits was exercised must be

evaluated at the time when the Contracting Party’s offer of consent to arbitration is accepted by
the investor. In the present case, Mongolia had not exercised its right when the Claimants

commenced this arbitration.“

279. According to the Claimants, the Respondents argue that Article 17(1) at once constitutes an

(i)

automatic denial of benefits by all the ECT contracting parties to all companies meeting the
criteria of Article 17(1) and reserves a Contracting Party the right to deny an investor the
advantages of Part III of the ECT at any time with regard to its pre-existing investments.
Contrary to the Respondents’ assertion, the Claimants reject the Respondents dual
interpretation of Article 17(1) of the ECT not because it is “unjust,” but because it is
inconsistent with (i) the terms of the ECT, (ii) the object and purpose of the ECT, and

(iii) relevant rules of international law.*”

Terms of the ECT

280. First, it is clear, according to the Claimants, that the terms of Article 17(1) of the ECT do not

constitute an automatic denial of benefits.*'? The Respondents’ attempt to analogize Article
17(1) to a limitation on the contracting parties’ consent to arbitrate disputes with investors
meeting the conditions stipulated therein is “overtly flawed.”“"' Article 17(1) is not one of the
dispute resolution provisions of the ECT and indeed is located in a different part of the
Treaty.!” The controlling language, “reserves the right to,” indicates that, while a state may
deny the benefit of Part III of the ECT to a certain class of investors, the exercise of this right is

optional.*"*

is “unprincipled and disingenuous.” The Respondents create the impression that contracting

and Spanish the object of the verb “réserver” and “reservar” is the right of the Contracting Party
to deny benefits. As Respondents acknowledge, this means that this right is being retained, and

as confirmed by the Macmillan English Dictionary, may or may not be exercised.‘"*

According to the Claimants, had the contracting parties to the Treaty intended to uniformly
impose a “real and effective nationality requirement” as a prerequisite to investor protection,

»415 However, because the Treaty’s

they would have drafted a restrictive definition of “Investor.
actual definition of “Investor” includes “a company or other organization organized in
accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party,” any entity falling within this
definition, including Khan Netherlands, is entitled to the protections of Part III of the Treaty, to
the extent that such protections have not been denied by the state in the exercise of its right

under Article 17(1) of the ECT.*"®

Moreover, the Plama tribunal confirms that Article 17(1) of the ECT does not itself constitute a
notice of denial of benefits. If all investors should “expect” to be denied the benefits of Part III
of the Treaty by all contracting parties, Article 17(1) would be rendered functionally equivalent
to a “real and effective nationality requirement.”*"’ Yet it cannot be presumed that the drafters
of the Treaty rejected this requirement in the definition of “Investor,” but implemented “a more

complicated and equivocal provision just to accomplish the same result.”*"*

The Claimants reject the Respondents’ reference to other investment treaties. Instruments such
as model BITs or the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement are not sources of
interpretive authority for Article 17(1) of the ECT under the general rules of interpretation for

treaties found at Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.

Besides, the Respondents have failed to identify an interpretive authority to indicate that the
denial of benefits provisions of these instruments should themselves be interpreted in the way

advocated here by the Respondents with regard to Article 17(1) of the ECT.*”

Similarly, the Respondents’ reliance on the NAFTA as an example of a treaty referring
explicitly to a prior notification is misplaced because the Respondents fail to mention that the

NAFTA’s explicit notification requirement applies toward the contracting state of which the

investor is a national, not toward the investor himself. The mechanism in NAFTA is therefore

not comparable to that of the ECT.“””

Object and purpose of the ECT

287. Interpreting Article 17(1) as allowing the right to deny benefits to be exercised retroactively

would undermine the object and purpose of the Treaty, including the preservation of

“complementarities and mutual benefits.”“”!

288. The Claimants argue that the Treaty does not impose any generic requirements as to ownership,

control, or business activities of the investors entitled to the protection of the ECT, because
different states take different approaches to international investment holding companies, such

as Khan Netherlands.

289. In this regard, the Netherlands has a generous approach to international investment holding

companies because it derives a significant economic benefit from being the home state to many
Special Financial Institutions, which incorporate in its jurisdiction rather than in the domiciles
of their parent companies and account for 75 percent of direct investment outflows in the

Netherlands.**

290. In this context, Article 17(1) of the ECT serves the interest of maximizing treaty participation

by allowing the contracting parties to implement their own policies within the overall
framework of the Treaty. A state that does not wish to extend protection to international
investment holding companies may exercise its right under Article 17(1) to deny benefits to
such entities, while international investment holding companies may choose to invest in another

signatory state of the ECT that has not exercised this right.“”*

291. However, this balance of interests can only be achieved if the state exercises its right under

Article 17(1) of the ECT ex ante. Moreover, the host country may derive a benefit in the form

of additional investment from declining to exercise its right under Article 17(1) of the ECT.

292. In the present case, the investment of capital and technical expertise invested by the Claimants

420

422

423

in Mongolia might not have been made had it not been possible to channel the investment
through a Dutch company. Thus, if Mongolia is allowed to invoke Article 17(1) at this stage, it

will have derived most of the benefits it could expect from the Treaty with none of the

Counter-memorial, paras. 370-371. The Claimants add that the Respondents’ assertion that international
investment holding companies provide no benefits to the states in which they incorporate is “simply wrong.”
In fact, as many states encourage their incorporation, international investment holding companies have
become “an integral component of modern international business” (Rejoinder, para. 256).

corresponding obligations.’*

Allowing Mongolia to deny benefits now would also incentivize
states to be non-transparent in their implementation of ECT policies, in contradiction with the
Treaty’s purpose and Mongolia’s obligation under Article 10(1) of the ECT to create

transparent conditions for investment.*”°
Rules of international law and the ECT

In addition, interpreting Article 17(1) of the ECT as allowing the retroactive exercise of the
right to deny benefits would violate the “relevant rules of international law applicable in the

relations between the parties,” and, particularly, the general principle of estoppel.’”°

According to the Claimants, estoppel “precludes person A from averring a particular state of
things against person B if A had previously, by words or conduct, unambiguously represented
to B the existence of a different state of things, and if on the faith of that representation, B had

so altered his position that the establishment of the truth would injure him.” “”

Consequently, in the present case, Mongolia cannot exclude Khan Netherlands from the
protections of Part III of the ECT after the company has invested in the Dornod Project in
reliance on these protections, given that Mongolia created the presumption that it assented to
affording these protections to Dutch international investment holding companies, in particular
by failing to exercise its right under Article 17(1) of the ECT and by offering investment
protections to such companies in other contexts, for instance through the Netherlands-Mongolia
BIT of 1996. **

Furthermore, the Claimants insist that the fact that Article 17(1) of the ECT does not specify a
method of notice for the exercise of a state’s right to deny benefits under this provision does not

entail that no notice is required.”

The Claimants also resist the Respondents’ assertion that an interpretation allowing only for the
prospective exercise of a state’s right under Article 17(1) of the ECT strips the provision of

0

effective meaning.” The Respondents’ argument rests entirely on the “unnecessary

assumption” that the right under Article 17(1) of the ECT would need to be exercised toward

each investor individually, thus requiring the host state to investigate all foreign investors in its

. 3
territory."

298. However, as explained by the Plama tribunal, a state could deny the advantages of Part III of

the ECT to a whole class of investors at once, by a “general declaration in a Contracting Party’s
official gazette ... or a statutory provision.” While the Respondents assert that a general
declaration may amount to a reservation to the Treaty, which is prohibited by its Article 46, in
the Claimants’ view, actions taken in accordance with Article 17(1) of the ECT cannot
implicate Article 46, as Article 17(1) forms part of the Treaty and applies equally to all

. «433
contracting parties.

299. Moreover, even if the Claimants’ interpretation deprived Article 17(1) of the ECT of effective

meaning, this could not lead the Tribunal to accept the Respondents’ alternative interpretation,
given that the principle of effet util cannot be employed to attribute to a treaty a meaning

contrary to its letter and spirit."

300. The Claimants also assert that, even if the decisions in Plama and Yukos were not “correct” in

their interpretation of Article 17(1) of the ECT, they nevertheless constitute the “accepted

interpretation” and entitle investors and signatory states to act accordingly.***

301. Various commentators, including the Respondents’ authorities, have thus remarked that the

Plama and Yukos decisions serve “as notice to all ECT signatories that they should make

proactive use of Article 17(1) of the ECT or risk losing its benefit.”**°

302. In addition, the Claimants indicate that the views of legal commentators are not a source of

interpretive authority under Article 31 of the VCLT, except to the extent that they reflect or
evidence “relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties,”
and in any event are inferior sources compared to the reasoned decisions of international

tribunals who have applied Article 17(1) of the ECT, such as in Plama and Yukos.*7

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction

303. The Claimants also assert that the decisions in Petrobart and Amto cannot be cited as evidence

of conflicting authority, because in these proceedings the issue of the contracting parties’

obligation to exercise their Article 17(1) right was not raised by the parties.‘**

304. Additionally, the Claimants explain that, contrary to the Respondents’ contention, they do not

rely on Plama and Yukos as “binding precedent.”**” Nonetheless, consistent decisions of arbitral
awards may properly be referenced as evidence of the ordinary meaning of the terms of a
provision in their context and in light of the Treaty’s object and purpose. Moreover, numerous
arbitral tribunals and commentators have observed that tribunals deciding investment cases

should, where possible, “pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals.”““°

305. As for the Respondents’ reliance on the subsequent practice of contracting parties to the ECT,

none of whom have exercised their right to deny benefits under Article 17(1) of the Treaty, it is
a non sequitur. For omissions to establish a practice, they must be accompanied by some
statement or action indicating that they constitute an application of the Treaty. In this case,
there is no evidence that any Contracting Party intentionally refrained from exercising a right
under Article 17(1), which it otherwise intends to rely upon, because it did not believe that such

action was necessary.“

306. Furthermore, the Claimants submit that the Respondents’ assertion that a state’s right under

Article 17(1) of the ECT can be exercised not only with respect to pre-existing investments, but
also after arbitration has been initiated, runs contrary to Article 26(3) of the ECT and to the
principle that mutual consent to arbitration, once perfected, cannot be unilaterally withdrawn.
By Article 26(3) of the ECT, each party gives its “unconditional consent to the submission of a
dispute to international arbitration.” Article 26(5) of the ECT confirms that once an investor
has provided its consent to UNCITRAL arbitration of a dispute pursuant to Article 26(4)(b), an
agreement to arbitrate is constituted between the investor and the Contracting Party. At that

moment, the consent to arbitration is “perfected” and can no longer be revoked.“

307. Under the Respondents’ interpretation of Article 17(1) of the ECT, however, the host state may

438

439

retroactively limit the scope of its consent to arbitration once its consent is perfected. Thus, in

this arbitration, Mongolia is purporting to create new factual circumstances (the exercise of a

latent prerogative to deny benefits) and thereby to quash the Tribunal’s jurisdiction after both

Parties have consented to such jurisdiction."

Finally, the Claimants take issue with the Respondents’ “factual misrepresentations,” in
particular denying that Khan Netherlands was created in preparation for this arbitration and any

subsequent attempts to conceal the company’s existence from the Respondents.“**

The Claimants contend that, in fact, while Khan Netherlands was incorporated in 2007, the
events leading to the current claims began only with the January 2009 announcement of the
forthcoming Russian-Mongolian joint mining venture and could not have been predicted at the
time of Khan Netherlands’ incorporation. Khan Netherlands’ existence was made known to
Mongolia in May 2008 through registration with the FIFTA, during the negotiations of the
MOU in 2009 and 2010, and in Khan Mongolia’s March 2010 letter to Mr. Enkhbat.°

In addition, the Respondents are incorrect in stating that all the Claimants’ investments in the
Dornod Project were made before Khan Netherlands acquired its interest in Khan Mongolia in

2007, as in fact the Claimants made significant investments in 2008 and 2009.4”

THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION OVER THE CLAIMANTS’ CLAIMS UNDER THE
FOREIGN INVESTMENT LAW

The Respondents’ position

The Respondents succinctly submit that pursuant to Article 25 of the Foreign Investment Law,
the Mongolian courts are specifically granted jurisdiction over the subject matter of the present
dispute, unless a contract or treaty provides otherwise.“* The Respondents note that the Foreign

Investment Law itself does not contain any recourse to arbitration.“

Decision on Jurisdiction

The Claimants’ position

312. The Claimants submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims of all the Claimants

against all the Respondents made under the Foreign Investment Law, pursuant to its Article

25. This provision states, in relevant part:

“Disputes between ... foreign investors and Mongolian legal or natural persons on the matters
relating to foreign investment and the operations of the foreign invested business entity shall
be resolved in the Courts of Mongolia unless provided otherwise by international treaties to
which Mongolia is a party or by any contract between the parties.”

313. The Claimants assert that Khan Canada, Khan Netherlands, and CAUC Holding are all “foreign

investors” under the Foreign Investment Law."*! The Claimants further state that, as alleged in
the Notice of Arbitration, the Respondents, by illegally invalidating the Mining and Exploration
Licenses, have breached Articles 8, 9, and 10 of the Foreign Investment Law, as well as Article
16(3) of the Constitution, the protections of which are specifically extended to foreign investors
by Article 8(1) of the Foreign Investment Law.*” The Claimants also note that the Respondents

“appear to concede at least that there ‘is a dispute arising out of the present subject matter.””***

314. The Claimants submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over these claims by virtue of Article

25 of the Foreign Investment Law, which, while it does not contain an independent arbitration
clause, provides that where a relevant treaty or contract between Mongolia and the investor
provides for international arbitration, Foreign Investment Law claims are to be resolved in

arbitration.

315. In the present case, the Founding Agreement, a “contract between the parties,” and the ECT, an

“international treat[y] to which Mongolia is a party,” both contain enforceable clauses that
provide for UNCITRAL arbitration. Therefore, if the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over
CAUC Holding’s and Khan Canada’s claims against MonAtom and Mongolia under the
Founding Agreement and over the claims of Khan Netherlands against Mongolia under the
ECT, then the Tribunal also has jurisdiction over all of the Claimants’ claims against all the

Respondents under the Foreign Investment Law.*** The Claimants assert that the Respondents

RELIEF REQUESTED

316. The Respondents request that the Tribunal decline jurisdiction to hear the claims brought by the

Claimants under the Notice of Arbitration.” In particular, the Respondents request that the
Tribunal grant an award on jurisdiction which finds that:
(i) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction ratione personae over any claims advanced by

either Khan Canada or Khan Netherlands, nor over any claims advanced against the
Government of Mongolia under the Founding Agreement;

(ii) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction ratione materiae for any claims advanced under
the Founding Agreement;

(iii) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction ratione personae over any claims advanced by
either Khan Canada or [CAUC Holding] under the ECT;

(iv) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over any claims advanced by Khan Netherlands
under the ECT on the basis that:

(1) Khan Netherlands has failed to comply with Mongolian law;

(2) Khan Netherlands has failed to respect the required three month waiting period
following a request for amicable settlement, as required by Article 26(2);

  

(3) Mongolia has not given unconditional consent for the submission of this dispute to
arbitration by operation of Article 26(3)(b)(1) ECT, as the dispute has previously been
submitted for determination by the Mongolian courts; and

(4) Khan Netherlands is denied the benefits of Part III of the ECT in accordance with
Article 17(1) ECT.“**

317. Furthermore, the Respondents request that the Tribunal “order the Claimants to pay all of the

costs and expenses of this arbitration including all the Respondents’ legal fees and costs, and

associated interest.”*”

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction

VII. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

319. Below, the Tribunal first addresses the burden of proof arguments put forward by the Parties

(section A), then considers its jurisdiction under the Founding Agreement (sections B, C, and
D) and the Energy Charter Treaty (sections E, F, G, and H), and finally analyses its jurisdiction

over Khan’s claims of breach of the Foreign Investment Law (section I).

BURDEN OF PROOF

320. The Parties first debate which facts must be proven at the jurisdictional stage of the

proceedings.

321. In this respect, the Tribunal finds compelling the reasoning of the Phoenix award on

jurisdiction, stating that:

[i]t . . . must look into the role [the] facts play either at the jurisdictional level or at the merits
level . . . . If the alleged facts are facts that, if proven, would constitute a violation of the
relevant BIT, they have indeed to be accepted as such at the jurisdictional stage, until their
existence is ascertained or not at the merits level. On the contrary, if jurisdiction rests on the
existence of certain facts, they have to be proven at the jurisdictional stage.

322. Accordingly, in the Tribunal’s view, facts relevant only to the Tribunal’s determination on

jurisdiction must be proven at the jurisdictional stage. By contrast, facts relevant only to the
merits need not be proven at this stage. For the latter facts, it is sufficient that the Claimants
make a prima facie case, and the Tribunal will take them as true pro tem for the purposes of its

determination on jurisdiction.“

323. Despite the Parties’ detailed submissions on this subject, there appears to be no real

disagreement between them with regard to these two categories of facts. Both Parties seem to

accept the above propositions.’**

324. The Parties do disagree as to whether facts relevant both to jurisdiction and merits must be

461

462

463

464

proven at this stage of the proceedings.“ In the Tribunal’s view, where the determination on
jurisdiction depends on facts, these facts must be proven at the jurisdictional stage and cannot
be taken pro tem, whether or not they will remain relevant for the determination on the merits.
This logically follows from the purpose of bifurcation between a jurisdictional and a merits

phase, which is to allow for the complete determination of jurisdictional issues during a

Exhibit CLA-51/RL-71, Phoenix, paras. 60-61.

For instance, when considering whether particular claims fall within the scope of the relevant arbitration
clause(s), the Tribunal will assume the accuracy of the facts on which the claims are based.

See Reply, paras. 14-15, 26; Rejoinder, paras. 8-11.
Reply, para. 20; Rejoinder, paras. 19-20.

71

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction
preliminary phase which may put an end to the proceedings before any need to debate the

merits arises and before the costs associated with such debate are incurred by the Parties.

325. For example, the facts relied upon by the Respondents to support their objection to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the ECT on the ground that Khan Netherlands has breached
Mongolian law are relevant to both jurisdiction and merits. To support their objection, the
Respondents invoke the same alleged legal violations by the Claimants the occurrence of which
the Claimants challenge as part of their case on the merits. If the Tribunal were to accept the
legal argument supporting the Respondents’ objection, it would then have to make a factual

determination regarding the alleged legal violations by the Claimants.“

326. With regard to all facts that must be proven at this stage of the proceedings in accordance with
the principles explained above, the rule, actori incumbit probatio, cited by both Parties, applies.
Article 27(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which are the applicable procedural rules in this case,
formulates the rule as follows: “Each party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on
to support its claim or defence.” The Tribunal applies this proposition where relevant in the

analysis below.

B. WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL HAS JURISDICTION RATIONE PERSONAE OVER KHAN
CANADA
327. The Respondents’ first objection to jurisdiction is that the Tribunal cannot assert jurisdiction

over Khan Canada because Khan Canada is not a party to the Founding Agreement.

328. It is undisputed between the Parties that Khan Canada is not a signatory of the Founding
Agreement, the contract containing Article 12, the arbitration clause invoked by the Claimants
as the basis for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Khan Canada. It is also undisputed that Khan
Canada has not become a party to the Founding Agreement by operation of any of the classical
mechanisms of contract or company law (assignment, agency, subrogation, succession, etc.).
The question that divides the Parties and that must be decided by the Tribunal is therefore

whether Khan Canada is a party to the arbitration agreement on some other basis.

329. While the Parties have formulated arguments as to applicable law — the Respondents arguing
for the application of Mongolian law, and the Claimants, for the application of French law,“ —

in the Tribunal’s view this point is of secondary importance. The Tribunal considers that the

465 However, as explained in section E of its analysis, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondents’ argument

on the law.

466 The Respondents argue for the application of Mongolian law, the governing law of the contract pursuant to
Article 12.1(i) of the Founding Agreement (Hearing Transcript 32:9-34:6), while the Claimants argue for the
application of French law, the law of the seat of arbitration in these proceedings (Rejoinder, paras. 63-66;
Hearing Transcript 121:18-122:8). The Claimants also acknowledge that this determination may be made
solely on the basis of the facts of the case (Counter-memorial, para. 178; Hearing Transcript 109:1-12).

72

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction
question of whether a non-signatory to a contract is nevertheless a party to the arbitration
agreement contained therein requires a factual determination of the common intention of the
signatory and non-signatory parties to the contract. The intention of the parties may be inferred
from their conduct in connection with the negotiation, performance, and termination of the

contract.

330. In passing, the Tribunal notes that both Parties have indicated that they consider consent to be
the basis of contractual relations in both Mongolian and French law.‘ The Tribunal is also
satisfied that under Mongolian and French law, the parties may manifest their consent not
solely by the signature of relevant documents, but also through conduct. The Parties agree that
this is the case under French law,*® and Article 43.3 of the Civil Code of Mongolia states as

much.”

331. The Respondents insist that Mongolian law does not recognize the so-called “group of
companies doctrine.” In this respect, the Tribunal observes that the Claimants do not rely on
this doctrine.*” The Tribunal further notes that no clear submissions have been made as to the
content of any such doctrine. In the Tribunal’s view, the mere existence of a group of
companies cannot affect the scope of the arbitration clause. As stated above, the relevant
inquiry is into the common intention of the Parties, as manifested through their conduct in the

negotiation, performance, and termination of the contract.

332. In the present case, it is undisputed that Khan Canada did not participate in the negotiation of
the Founding Agreement. In fact, Khan Canada was only incorporated in October 2002, long
after the Founding Agreement had been negotiated and executed. It is therefore plain that at the
time when Erdene, Priargunsky, and WM Mining executed the Founding Agreement, Khan

Canada was not a party thereto.

333. However, on July 2003, Khan Canada acquired the shares of WM Mining (through Khan
Bermuda) and thus became the ultimate controlling shareholder in CAUC. While this sole fact
does not suffice to make Khan Canada a party to the Founding Agreement, the Tribunal notes
that as of that time Khan Canada behaved as if it were replacing CAUC Holding as a party to
the Founding Agreement, in particular by performing CAUC Holding’s obligations under the

Founding Agreement.

PCA Case No. 2011-09

Decision on Jurisdiction

334. At this juncture, the Tribunal considers it useful to explain that in its view, in order to achieve a
complete understanding of the relationship between the Parties, it is necessary to examine not

only the Founding Agreement itself, but also the Minerals Agreement. The fact that no claims

are asserted under the Minerals Agreement is irrelevant. While a Tribunal may only give effect

to an agreement on which its jurisdiction is based, it may, however, take into consideration
another agreement (in this case the Minerals Agreement) involving all or some of the same
parties for the purpose of interpretation of the first agreement (i.e., the Founding Agreement).

The fact that it does not have jurisdiction over all parties to the Minerals Agreement matters

471
not.

335. The Minerals Agreement was entered into by Erdene, Priargunsky, and WM Mining three days
before they concluded the Founding Agreement. In its introduction, it expresses the parties’
desire to form a joint venture for the purpose of developing a uranium extraction project in
Dornod (what both Parties refer to in their memorials as the “Dornod Project”). As a means of
giving life to the proposed joint venture, the Minerals Agreement provides for the establishment
of a company through the conclusion of a “Founding Agreement.” The Founding Agreement of
6 June 1995 was executed as a result. As the Founding Agreement establishes CAUC, while the
purpose of this company is found in part in the Minerals Agreement, these two documents
complete one another in portraying the relationship between the parties involved in the Dornod
Project. Articles 3.4 and 16.1 of the Founding Agreement further confirm the relevance of the

Minerals Agreement.*”

336. In accordance with Article 5.4 of the Founding Agreement and Article 2.4 of the Minerals
Agreement, the role of WM Mining, CAUC Holding’s predecessor in the Founding Agreement,
was to raise money and invest it into the joint venture. Under Articles 1.2 and 1.3 of the
Minerals Agreement, WM Mining was also expected to conduct and assume the costs of

feasibility studies regarding the Dornod Project.

337. The Tribunal notes that the Parties’ submissions provide no indication that WM Mining or
CAUC Holding ever acted in performance of these obligations. In fact, it is Khan Canada that

raised funds on the Toronto Stock Exchange and commissioned feasibility studies and other

47! See eg Klockner v. Cameroon, ICSID Annulment Decision of 3 May 1985, Y.B.Com.Arb 162, 1986. See

reports.’”

While the Respondents argue that the Dornod Project never benefited from the
money raised, the Tribunal observes that the studies and reports produced by the Claimants are
tangible proof that progress was being made on the project. Khan Canada itself, and not any of
its subsidiaries, is indicated as the client in all of them. In addition, by all accounts, Khan
Canada (through Khan Mongolia) acquired the Exploration License. The other parties to the

Founding Agreement recognized that this acquisition would benefit the Dornod Project.**

338. By ensuring the performance of CAUC Holding’s obligations under the Founding Agreement,

Khan Canada acted as the “real party” to the Founding Agreement.

339. Further, the Claimants, in tackling their burden of proof, have successfully demonstrated that
the other parties to the Founding Agreement — the SPC, the MRAM, and MonAtom - knew of
and accepted Khan Canada’s participation in the Dornod Project. CAUC Holding is seldom, if
ever, mentioned in the documents relating to CAUC and the Dornod Project produced by the
Parties. By contrast, a variety of documents issued by Mongolian state agencies refer to the
third shareholder in CAUC or the owner of the Mining License as “Khan Canada” or the
“Canadian,””* and to CAUC as the “Mongolian-Russian-Canadian” joint venture.” The
minutes of a CAUC management committee meeting held on 26 August 2009, and signed by,
inter alia, MonAtom, are the most compelling acknowledgment of Khan Canada’s active role
in the performance of the Founding Agreement. These minutes record the fact that Khan
Canada completed and even exceeded “its commitments as per the original Founding
Agreement.” Similarly, the minutes of the CAUC management committee meeting of
9 November 2009, also signed by MonAtom, recognize the expected benefits of Khan

Resources’ planned contribution of the Exploration License to the joint venture.‘”*

340. The documents pertaining to the SPC’s attempt to sell its shares in CAUC in 2005 are also
telling. The SPC issued a resolution on 22 September 2005, stating that the shares would first
be offered to Priargunsky and Khan Canada, “a Canadian company owning 58 % of shares of

[CAUC],” and that, if these “other shareholders” refused to buy the shares, these would be sold

at a public auction.” This plan reflects the SPC’s attempt to comply with the pre-emption
rights accorded to other shareholders under Article 11 of the Founding Agreement in cases of
transfer of shares to a third party. Pursuant to the SPC’s offer, a memorandum of understanding
for the sale of the SPC’s shares in CAUC was entered into between the SPC and, notably, Khan
Canada itself.“” The fact that the shares were offered to Khan Canada rather than CAUC
Holding shows that the SPC considered Khan Canada, and not CAUC Holding, to be the real

party to the Founding Agreement.

Given that Khan Canada performed the obligations of CAUC Holding in the joint venture from
the time that it acquired WM Mining, and that MonAtom and its predecessors in the Founding
Agreement were aware of, expressly acknowledged and never objected to that fact, the Tribunal
finds that Khan Canada, MonAtom, and its predecessors, formed the common intention that
Khan Canada become a party to the Founding Agreement and the arbitration agreement

contained therein.

As a result, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction over Khan Canada under the

Founding Agreement.

WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL HAS JURISDICTION RATIONE PERSONAE OVER
MONGOLIA

The Respondents object to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae over Mongolia under
the Founding Agreement on the ground that Mongolia is not a party to it. The Claimants, for
their part, assert that Mongolia is and has from the start been a party to the Founding
Agreement through various representatives, namely, Erdene, the SPC, the MRAM, and,

currently, MonAtom.

The Claimants bear the burden of proving the facts on which they rely in support of this
proposition. Having reviewed the evidence produced by both Parties, including the Tsogt

Report, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have succeeded in discharging this burden.

In the Tribunal’s view, the relationship between a state and its alleged representative must be
assessed under the law of this state and in light of the factual background of this relationship.
As concerns Mongolian law, the Tribunal relies on the Tsogt Report produced by the
Claimants. The Respondents did not put forward a Mongolian law expert of their own, and
Mr. Tsogt’s plausible analysis was unshaken in cross-examination. The Tribunal therefore

accepts Mr. Tsogt’s opinion that under Mongolian law, and in particular in light of the LSLP,

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction
Erdene and MonAtom acted as representatives of Mongolia.**! This assessment coheres with
what seems to have been the parties’ understanding throughout the life of the Founding

Agreement.

The fact that the SPC and the MRAM were parties to the Founding Agreement from 2001 to
2009 is uncontested. These entities are by all accounts Mongolian state agencies. As they do
not have a legal existence separate from the Government, it is plain that Mongolia was the party

to the Founding Agreement under the names “SPC” and “MRAM” from 2001 to 2009.

Erdene and MonAtom, the other two Mongolian entities who have been at one time parties to
the Founding Agreement, are, by contrast, limited liability companies. To understand their
relationship with Mongolia in the context of the Founding Agreement, it is helpful to start with
the texts of both this Agreement and the Minerals Agreement. As explained in section B of the
Tribunal’s analysis, the latter document provides an essential element of context for

understanding the relationship between the parties to the Founding Agreement.

Remarkably, under both the Founding Agreement and the Minerals Agreement, Erdene
undertook obligations that only a sovereign state could fulfil. Thus, Article 5.3 of the Founding
Agreement provides that the contribution of Erdene to the Charter fund will materialize out of a
“reduction of fees to be paid by [CAUC] for the utilization of natural resources.” Article 2.2 of
the Minerals Agreement phrases the same idea in more general terms: “The contribution of

Erdene consists of the right to utilize mineral deposits.”

The Respondents point out that in some provisions of the Minerals Agreement (such as Articles
1.1 and 7.2), it is the “Ministry of Energy, Geology and Mining of Mongolia” or the
“government of Mongolia” that undertakes the sovereign actions of issuing licenses or
exempting CAUC from taxes and customs duties. On this basis, the Respondents argue that
Erdene and Mongolia are conceptualized as separate entities in the Minerals Agreement. The
Tribunal disagrees. Read in context of the entire agreement, the cited provisions appear to
provide the detail of Erdene’s contribution to the joint venture, expressed succinctly in
Article 5.4 of the Founding Agreement. In fact, Article 1.1 of the Minerals Agreement
explicitly states that the undertaking was made by the “Ministry of Energy, Geology and
Mining of Mongolia, represented by Erdene,” while Article 13.1 of the Minerals Agreement
states that it was made by “Erdene, on behalf of the Ministry of Energy, Geology and Mining

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction
Given that Erdene is wholly owned by Mongolia, and that no private party could fulfil Erdene’s
undertakings under either the Founding Agreement or the Minerals Agreement, it is reasonable

to conclude that these undertakings were made on behalf of the Government.

Further, Articles 12.1 and 12.2 of the Minerals Agreement illustrate an interchangeable use of

the words “Erdene” and “Mongolia.” These provisions read, in relevant part:

12.1 Erdene acknowledges that its equity interest in the Company (33 1/3 %) is its entire
interest in the mineral titles covered by this Agreement, except for the royalty as set forth in
Paragraph 12.2 herein.

12.2 [CAUC] agrees to pay to Mongolia five percent (5 %) royalty ....
Thus, while both subparagraphs refer to the same “royalty,” the first describes it as payable to

Erdene and the second, as payable to Mongolia.

Additionally, Article 15.1 of the Founding Agreement indicates that all notices addressed to
Erdene should be directed to the address of the Mongolian Ministry of Energy, Geology, and

Mining. This also suggests some level of identity between Erdene and Mongolia.

Taken together, these provisions show that from the start, Mongolia was a party to the

Founding Agreement, albeit through a representative.

The Claimants have also succeeded in demonstrating that at all subsequent times, from the
establishment of CAUC to the commencement of this arbitration, the parties understood that
Mongolia was a party to the Founding Agreement. The behaviour of the parties with respect to
the transfers of CAUC shares from Erdene to the MRAM in 2001, and from the SPC to
MonAtom in 2009, is decisive.

Under Article 11 of the Founding Agreement, any shareholder wishing to “assign, transfer,
convey or otherwise dispose” of its shares in CAUC must give the other shareholders of CAUC
a ninety day “written notice of the price and terms upon which the [d]isposing [shareholder]
would be willing to sell such interest,” giving the other shareholders the opportunity to acquire
the shares themselves. No such notice appears to have been provided with respect to the
transfers from Erdene to the MRAM (i.e., Mongolia), and from the SPC (i.e., Mongolia) to
MonAtom.

The Respondents rely on a letter from the SPC dated 4 June 2009" to prove that the transfer of
shares from the SPC to MonAtom was notified to the other shareholders in accordance with
Article 11 of the Founding Agreement. However, this letter was not addressed to the other

shareholders, but to MonAtom, and it merely announced post-factum that the CAUC shares

“had been” transferred to MonAtom. In the Tribunal’s view, this letter does not constitute a
sufficient notice under Article 11 of the Founding Agreement.

Remarkably, this letter refers to the CAUC shares being transferred as “the state shares . . . that

allow[...] to implement the right to represent the state.”"**

The minutes of the shareholder meeting of 26 August 2009 similarly refer to the passage of the

management of the state shares from the SPC to MonAtom.***

The fact that no notice was given pursuant to Article 11 of the Founding Agreement and that
accordingly the other shareholders were not given an opportunity to exercise their right of pre-
emption suggests that these transfers of shares were not considered transfers to a third party in

the meaning of Article 11.

In conclusion, the text of the Founding Agreement and the Minerals Agreement, as well as the
behaviour of Mongolia, Erdene, the SPC, the MRAM, and MonAtom, demonstrate the
understanding of the parties that all the Mongolian entities, including MonAtom, were acting
on behalf of the state. The Tsogt Report confirms that this understanding was correct under
Mongolian law. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over Mongolia under the

Founding Agreement.

WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL HAS JURISDICTION RATIONE MATERIAE OVER THE
CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THE FOUNDING AGREEMENT

Having found that Khan Canada and Mongolia are both parties to the Founding Agreement and
the arbitration agreement contained therein at Article 12, the Tribunal now turns to the question
of whether the claims asserted by Khan Canada and CAUC Holding against MonAtom and
Mongolia under the Founding Agreement fall within the scope of Article 12.

At the outset, it is useful to quote both the relevant language of the arbitration agreement and
Khan’s description of its claims.

Article 12 of the Founding Agreement provides for arbitration of “[d]isputes between the
parties arising out of, or in connection with, any provisions of this agreement or the
interpretation thereof.”

In the section of their Notice of Arbitration dedicated to the Founding Agreement, the
Claimants state as follows:

In entering the Founding Agreement, Mongolia also undertook obligations to [the] Claimants
in its capacity as the State party to a joint venture designed to develop the State's natural

44 Exhibit C-37.
45 Exhibit C-38.

Decision on Jurisdiction

resources. Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement specifically provides that “Property of the
Company [i.e., CAUC] will not be subject to requisition or confiscation.” Moreover,
Mongolia, as a party to the Founding Agreement (currently through its representative,
MonAtom) breached its fiduciary obligations to the joint venture and its partner [CAUC
Holding] under Mongolian law. Under Mongolian law, joint venture partners are fiduciaries to
one another. Respondents were required to act in good faith and owed a duty to act in the best
interests of CAUC. In addition, under Article 82 of the Company Law of Mongolia, a duty is
imposed upon a “governing party” of a company to act in good faith and in the best interests
of the company. A “governing party” includes any shareholder who holds more than 20% of
the shares of a limited liability company and, therefore, includes the Mongolian Government
as a 21% shareholder in CAUC. Any governing party who breaches this duty is liable to the
company itself and to any shareholder holding more than 1% of the company's shares (such as
[CAUC Holding]}) for damages caused by the breach. Furthermore, Article 497.1 of the Civil
Code of Mongolia provides that a person or company is liable where it has caused damage to
another person's rights, life, health, dignity, business reputation or property deliberately or due
to negligent action."*°

  

366. In their Counter-memorial, the Claimants allege that Mongolia, “as a party to the Founding
Agreement,” has breached its obligation under international law to treat foreign investors in

accordance with certain minimum standards, which include “non-expropriation without

compensation, non-arbitrariness and non-abuse of discretion.”**’

367. The Claimants further state that the following facts underlie their claims:

Specifically, Respondent's acts and omissions breaching these obligations include (but are not
limited to): the illegal invalidation of the [M]ining and [E]xploration [L]icenses; the passage
of the [NEL] that provides, inter alia, for the taking of the ownership interest in CAUC and
Khan Mongolia without compensation; Mongolia's refusal to re-register the licenses under the
NEL pursuant to the 9 2009 Re-registrati i making unf public
statements alleging that the Claimants were in breach of Mongolian law; and, the repeated
actions intended to undermine [the] Claimants' reputation in Mongolia and abroad.***

 

368. While the Respondents focus much of their argument on the absence of an appropriate legal
foundation to Khan’s claims, the Tribunal considers that at this stage of the proceedings, it can

proceed on the assumption that Khan’s claims are valid in law.

369. Furthermore, in the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants have made out a prima facie case with
respect to the facts on which their claims depend. Therefore, in analyzing its ratione materiae
jurisdiction, the Tribunal takes the Claimants’ factual allegations concerning the merits as true

pro tem.

370. Therefore, the only relevant question at this point is whether Khan’s claims fall within the
scope of the arbitration agreement — i.e., whether for each of these claims the dispute “arises
out of, or in connection with, the provisions of the [Founding Agreement] or the interpretation

thereof.”

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction

371. The Respondents divide Khan’s claims into three categories: (i) expropriation claims,
(ii) breach of fiduciary duty claims, and (iii) claims under international law. The Tribunal

addresses each category in turn.
(i) Expropriation claims

372. The Tribunal notes that, contrary to the Respondents’ depiction, the Claimants do not make any
broad “expropriation claims” under the Founding Agreement. Rather, the Claimants
specifically allege that Mongolia has breached Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement.**” While
the Parties extensively debate whether Article 3.6 constitutes an expropriation clause similar to
those typically found in investment treaties, this is a matter of interpretation of Article 3.6 to be
resolved at the merits stage. At present, it is sufficient for the Tribunal to observe that a dispute
exists between the Parties concerning the interpretation and application of Article 3.6 and that,
as a dispute arising out of the interpretation of a provision of the Founding Agreement, it falls

squarely within the scope of the arbitration agreement.
(ii) Breach of fiduciary duty claim

373. The Tribunal observes that Khan’s breach of fiduciary duty claim is based on various
provisions of Mongolian law rather than on a specific provision of the Founding Agreement.
The question is therefore whether any fiduciary duties that the Respondents may have toward
Khan Canada and CAUC Holding under Mongolian law are sufficiently connected to the
Founding Agreement to fall within the scope of the language of Article 12. The Tribunal

considers that they are.

374. The Tribunal understands the words “in connection with” in Article 12 of the Founding
Agreement to be quite broad. They encompass more than only claims of breach of the Founding

Agreement.

375. As described in section B of the Tribunal’s analysis, the introduction to the Minerals
Agreement expresses the “desire” of the founders of CAUC (WM Mining, Erdene, and
Priargunsky) “to establish a joint business venture pursuant to Mongolian law in order to mine
and process uranium ore as well as other minerals . . . in the area of the Dornod deposit in
northeastern Mongolia.” Article 3.1 of the Minerals Agreement specifies that the founders of
CAUC “shall conduct the business of the venture as a company with limited liability under the
laws of Mongolia . . . and shall form the Company by entering into the Founding Agreement.”
It is apparent on this basis that CAUC Holding was established by the Founding Agreement for

the purpose of the pursuit of the joint venture described in the Minerals Agreement.

81

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction

376. The fiduciary duties invoked by the Claimants arise precisely out of the relationship between
Khan Canada, CAUC Holding, Mongolia, and MonAtom as partners in the joint venture for the
pursuit of which CAUC was created through the Founding Agreement. The Claimants base
their breach of fiduciary duty claims in great part on the allegation that Mongolia revoked and

refused to re-issue the Mining and Exploration Licenses in order to be able to pursue the

  

Dornod Project without the participation of the Claimants, i.e., to avoid having to comply with
its obligations under the Founding Agreement and the Minerals Agreement to pursue a joint

venture with CAUC Holding and Khan Canada.

377. The Tribunal therefore finds that the breach of fiduciary duty claims arise “in connection with”

the provisions of the Founding Agreement and therefore fall within the scope of Article 12.
(iii) Claims under international law

378. Similarly, the Tribunal finds that since Khan Canada’s and CAUC Holding’s breach of
international law claims are based on Mongolia’s alleged attempts to avoid participating in the
joint venture set up under the Founding Agreement, these claims are sufficiently connected to

the provisions of the Founding Agreement to fall within the scope of Article 12.

379. As a result, the Tribunal finds that it has ratione materiae jurisdiction over all the above claims

made by Khan Canada and CAUC Holding under the Founding Agreement.

E. WHETHER KHAN NETHERLANDS IS PREVENTED FROM BRINGING ECT CLAIMS
DUE TO ITS FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH MONGOLIAN LAW

380. The Respondents object to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Khan Netherlands under the ECT on
the ground that Khan Netherlands has violated Mongolian law in the course of its investment.
In support of their objection, the Respondents argue that an investor who has violated the laws
of the host state is not entitled to the substantive protections of the ECT regardless of whether

such violations “occurred before or after the initial investment was made.”*””

381. The Tribunal disagrees with this proposition.

382. The awards cited by the Respondents in support of their assertion merely state the rule that the

protections of an investment treaty such as the ECT cannot be extended to an investment made

illegally.”!

°° Memorial, para. 124; Reply, para. 153.

4°! Tn the Plama Award on the Merits, the tribunal found that “the substantive protections of the ECT cannot
apply to investments made contrary to law” (Exhibit CLA-S0, para. 139) (emphasis added). Similarly, in
Phoenix, the tribunal stated that “. . . States cannot be deemed to offer access to the ICSID dispute settlement
mechanism to investments made in violation of their laws” (Exhibit CLA-51/RL-17, para. 101) (emphasis
added). In Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award of

 

82

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction

383. This is logical. An investor who has obtained its investment in the host state only by acting in

bad faith or in violation of the laws of the host state, has brought him or herself within the
scope of application of the ECT only as a result of his wrongful acts. Such an investor should
not be allowed to benefit as a result, in accordance with the maxim nemo auditur propriam

turpitudinem allegans.

384. However, there is no compelling reason to altogether deny the right to invoke the ECT to any

investor who has breached the law of the host state in the course of its investment. The ECT
contains no provision to this effect. If the investor acts illegally, the host state can impose upon
it sanctions available under local law, as Mongolia indeed purports to have done by invalidating
and refusing to re-register the Exploration License. However, if the investor believes these
sanctions to be unjustified, it must have the possibility of challenging their validity. It would
undermine the purpose and object of the Treaty to deny the investor the right to make its case
before an arbitral tribunal based on the same alleged violations the existence of which the

investor seeks to dispute on the merits.

385. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Respondents’ objection to jurisdiction and defers the

question of whether Khan Netherlands has breached Mongolian law to the merits.

WHETHER KHAN NETHERLANDS IS PREVENTED FROM BRINGING ECT CLAIMS
BY OPERATION OF ARTICLE 26(3)(B)(I) OF THE ECT

386. The Respondents object to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the ECT on the ground that

Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT, the Treaty’s fork in the road provision, was triggered by the
claims initiated by Khan Mongolia and CAUC in April 2010 before the Administrative Court.

387. The Tribunal notes that Mongolia is listed in Annex ID of the Treaty as one of the states which,

in accordance with Article 26(b)(i) of the ECT, have restricted their unconditional consent to

 

2 August 2006, the claimant was denied the protection of the BIT because it had acted improperly “in order
to be awarded the bid that made its investment possible” (para. 243). In Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport
Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Award of 16 August 2007,
this point was addressed in some detail in obiter: “Although this contention is not relevant to the analysis of
the problem which the Tribunal has before it, namely the entry of the investment and not the way it was
subsequently conducted, the Tribunal would note that this part of the Respondent's interpretation appears to
be a forced construction of the pertinent provisions in the context of the entire Treaty. The language of both
Articles 1 and 2 of the BIT emphasizes the initiation of the investment. Moreover the effective operation of
the BIT regime would appear to require that jurisdictional compliance be limited to the initiation of the
investment. If, at the time of the initiation of the investment, there has been compliance with the law of the
host state, allegations by the host state of violations of its law in the course of the investment, as a
justification for state action with respect to the investment, might be a defense to claimed substantive
violations of the BIT, but could not deprive a tribunal acting under the authority of the BIT of its
jurisdiction” (para. 345) (emphasis in the original).

   

83

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction

the submission of disputes to international arbitration to those disputes that have not been

previously submitted to the “courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party.”

388. The Tribunal must therefore determine whether the dispute submitted to arbitration before it is

the same dispute that was submitted to the Administrative Court in the proceedings indicated by

the Respondents.

389. At the hearing on jurisdiction, the Respondents admitted that their objection to the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction would fail if the Tribunal were to apply the so-called “triple identity” test to

493

compare the local and international proceedings.” The Respondents therefore argued for the

application of what they identified as the “fundamental basis” test.

390. However, in the present case, the Tribunal sees no reason to go beyond the triple identity test.

There is ample authority for its application.*”*

391. The Respondents principally argue that the triple identity test strips the fork in the road

provision of any practical effect, presumably because it is unrealistic to expect all three prongs
of the test to be satisfied. It must first be replied that the test for the application of fork in the
road provisions should not be too easy to satisfy, as this could have a chilling effect on the
submission of disputes by investors to domestic fora, even when the issues at stake are clearly
within the domain of local law. This may cause claims being brought to international arbitration
before they are ripe on the merits, simply because the investor is afraid that by submitting the
existing dispute to local courts or tribunals, it will forgo its right to later make any claims

related to the same investment before an international arbitral tribunal.

392. The Respondents’ argument that the test is too strict may have some persuasive force in cases

492

493

494

where only one of the requirements of the triple identity test is not satisfied, while the
remaining requirements, as well as other aspects of the two disputes are identical. But this is not
the case here. The Respondents identify the three criteria of the triple identity test as being

parties, cause, and object. Not one of these criteria is satisfied in the present case.

393. First, the parties to both disputes are different. The proceedings before the Administrative Court

were initiated by Khan Mongolia and CAUC, while the only claimant asserting ECT claims
before the Tribunal is Khan Netherlands.“”°

394. Second, the causes of action of both disputes are different. Before the Administrative Court,

Khan Mongolia and CAUC challenged the NEA’s invalidation of the Mining and Exploration
Licenses on the grounds that the NEA had violated procedural requirements of various
Mongolian laws and regulations. The Administrative Court decided on this basis.“”° Before this
Tribunal, Khan argues its case on the basis of breach of the ECT. Such claims could not have

been submitted for decision by the Administrative Court.

395. Finally, and most importantly, the objects of the local and international proceedings differ.

CAUC and Khan Mongolia asked the Administrative Court to quash the NEA’s administrative
decision to invalidate the Mining and Exploration Licenses.°’ By contrast, in these
proceedings, Khan Netherlands is seeking compensation for the alleged loss of its investment.
In light of Mr. Tsogt’s unhesitating testimony at the hearing, the Tribunal considers that this
goal could not have been achieved through the proceedings before the Administrative Court, as

that Court does not have the power to grant damages. “*

396. This is therefore not a case where the investor seeks to try its luck a second time to obtain what

it wants in relation to the same dispute but before a different forum.

397. The Tribunal further notes that CAUC’s claim before the Administrative Court was concerned

with the allegedly invalid invalidation of the Mining License, an action of Mongolia that Khan
Netherlands does not contest under the ECT. The Tribunal also notes that Khan Mongolia, for
its part, challenged only one of the actions of Mongolia (invalidation of the Exploration

License) that form the basis of Khan Netherlands’ claims in this arbitration.“

practices and conditions of Mongolia do not allow an investor to resubmit the same dispute to
International arbitration.”

The Tribunal does not see how this statement lends support to the Respondents’ objection, as it
contains no additional guidance as to what constitutes the “same dispute” under the ECT or as a

matter of policy or practice in Mongolia.

The Tribunal therefore finds that the fork in the road provision of the ECT has not been

triggered.

WHETHER KHAN NETHERLANDS HAS COMPLIED WITH THE WAITING PERIOD
REQUIREMENT OF ARTICLE 26(2) OF THE ECT

The Respondents object to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the ground that Khan Netherlands has
not respected the amicable dispute settlement requirements of Articles 26(1) and 26(2) of the
ECT.

Article 26(1) provides that disputes under the Treaty “shall, if possible, be settled amicably.”
Article 26(2) further provides that if such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions
of paragraph 1, i.e., amicably, “within a period of three months from the date on which either
party to the dispute requested amicable settlement,” the investor may submit its dispute to

international arbitration.

The Tribunal is of the view that Khan Netherlands has complied with the requirement to
attempt amicable resolution of the present dispute by the Letter to the Prime Minister, sent on
15 April 2010, almost nine months before the commencement of this arbitration, and by the
subsequent negotiation attempts made by senior officers of Khan Canada and Khan Netherlands

during meetings with representatives of MonAtom and Mongolia.

The Tribunal adopts a broad understanding of what constitutes sufficient notice to trigger the
three month waiting period of Article 26(2) of the Treaty, as the ECT does not contain any
explicit formal requirements for such purpose. Article 26(1) aims at encouraging good faith
negotiations between parties, without unduly limiting the recourse to arbitration. Thus, in
making the amicable settlement request referred to at Article 26(2) of the ECT, the investor
need only (i) describe the dispute in a manner sufficient to enable the other party to understand
what is being referred to, and (ii) manifest the desire to seek an amicable resolution.

The Tribunal shares the views of the tribunal in Amto, which stated:

A party can request amicable settlement of a dispute without identifying any ECT claims, and

an Investor may have good reason not to formulate claims at this stage, in order to avoid
taking a position or appearing to threaten the State party with arbitration before bona fide

5 Exhibit RL-28.

86

Decision on Jurisdiction

settlement discussions. The purpose of Article 26(2) —to provide for settlement discussions—
requires the avoidance of legal forms, and the facilitation of open communication. The
Investor must inform the State of the state of affairs involving disagreement, and request
amicable settlement. If the State considers there is insufficient information to initiate
discussions then the good faith response is simply to so advise the Investor, and require more
detail. In other words, to initiate the type of communications envisaged by Article 26(2).°"'

  

  

406. In the present case, the Letter to the Prime Minister described the history of the dispute at

length and in much the same way as it is described in the Notice of Arbitration by which these
proceedings were commenced. This description was more than sufficient to allow Mongolia to
understand what the dispute was about, and, in the words of the Amto tribunal, to “investigate

and take steps to resolve the dispute.”*”

Contrary to the Respondents’ assessment, the Tribunal
considers that the tone of the letter is neither “aggressive” nor “threatening.” In fact, the Letter
to the Prime Minister contains language expressing the Claimants’ willingness to discuss the
issues raised by the letter, as well as an offer by Mr. Quick to travel to Mongolia to meet the

. ee 3
Prime Minister in person.”°

407. The Respondents argue that the Letter to the Prime Minister did not constitute sufficient notice

to trigger the three month waiting period of Article 26(2) because it was sent on the letterhead
of Khan Canada, signed by Mr. Quick, Khan Canada’s CEO, and did not explicitly mention
Khan Netherlands, although it mentioned both Khan Canada, its parent company, and Khan

aa However, the Tribunal considers that it was reasonable for

Mongolia, its direct subsidiary.
Khan Canada, the ultimate shareholder of CAUC and the parent of both CAUC Holding and
Khan Mongolia, to write to the Prime Minister of Mongolia with respect to a dispute that
concerned both the Mining and Exploration Licenses. Khan Canada was the only party with an
interest in both licenses at once, and also the only party with the authority to reach an amicable
settlement on behalf of all the others. Had Mongolia been able to reach agreement with Khan
Canada with regard to the grievances expressed in the Letter to the Prime Minister, it would

also have eliminated the grounds for Khan Netherlands’ claims in this arbitration.

408. In addition, in the Tribunal’s view, the Respondents’ claim that the Claimants attempted to hide

the existence of Khan Netherlands is not borne out by the evidence.*”

409. Given that the Tribunal finds that Khan Netherlands has met the attempt at amicable settlement

requirement of Article 26, it becomes unnecessary to address the Parties’ arguments concerning

the jurisdictional or procedural nature of this requirement. Nor does the Tribunal need to decide
whether the requirement extends only to situations where amicable dispute settlement is

“possible,” as asserted by the Claimants.

H. WHETHER KHAN NETHERLANDS’ CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY OPERATION OF
ARTICLE 17(1) OF THE ECT

410. The Tribunal now turns to the Respondents’ argument that the benefits of Part III of the ECT
are denied to Khan Netherlands by operation of Article 17(1), the denial of benefits clause of

the Treaty.

411. At the outset, it must be stated that in the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent’s argument cannot
affect the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Khan Netherlands’ claims under the ECT. The
introductory section of Article 17 of the ECT specifies that it concerns the denial of advantages
of “this Part,” that is, Part III of the Treaty, which is titled “Investment Promotion and
Protection” and sets forth the substantive protections that each Contracting Party shall accord to
investors of other contracting parties. Article 26 of the ECT, on which the Claimants rely to
establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, is found in Part V, which is dedicated to “Dispute
Settlement.” Thus, on a reading of the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 17, this
provision can operate to deny Khan Netherlands the benefit of the substantive protections it
would otherwise be entitled to under the Treaty, but not to deny it the advantage of arbitrating
its dispute with the Respondents before this Tribunal. The question of the application of
Article 17 is therefore one for the merits, not jurisdiction.

412. The Tribunal’s views on this point concord with those of the tribunals in Yukos and Plama.*”

413. Nevertheless, as the Parties have agreed to treat the question of the application or non-

application of Article 17(1) as a preliminary question,”

and have extensively briefed the
Tribunal thereon, and as a finding that Article 17(1) applies in the present case may spare the
Parties the cost and effort of making further voluminous submissions concerning the merits of
Khan Netherlands’ claims under the Treaty, the Tribunal will render a definitive decision on

this question in this award.
414. The relevant section of Article 17 is reproduced for ease of reference:

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction

Each Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of this Part to:
(1) a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such entity and if that

entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is
organized . . .

415. The Claimants have conceded that the substantive conditions of Article 17(1) of the ECT — that

the legal entity invoking the protections of the ECT be owned or controlled by citizens or
nationals of a third state and that such legal entity have no substantial business activities in the
place in which it is organized — are met in the present case. It is uncontested that Khan
Netherlands is owned and controlled by Khan Canada, an entity incorporated in Canada, which
is a “third state” for purposes of Article 17(1), and that Khan Canada has no substantial
business activities in the Netherlands, the “Contracting Party” in which it is organized. Hence,

Khan Netherlands is the kind of entity to which Article 17(1) could apply.

416. However, the Parties disagree as to whether Article 17(1) applies to Khan Netherlands in the

(i)

present case. This is a matter of interpretation of the provision. The Respondents appear to put
forward, without clearly distinguishing between them, two interpretations of Article 17(1). On
the one hand, the Respondents contend that Article 17(1) operates as an automatic denial of
benefits by all Contracting Parties to all legal entities that satisfy the substantive conditions of
paragraph 1 of this Article.’ On the other hand, the Respondents seem to argue that under
Article 17(1), a Contracting Party may at any time, including after the commencement of the
arbitral proceedings, deny the benefits of Part III of the Treaty to a legal entity that satisfies the
provision’s criteria. It is plain that these two interpretations of Article 17(1) are mutually
exclusive and the Tribunal will address each in turn in the following, as if they had been

presented as alternative arguments.

Does Article 17(1) of the ECT constitute an automatic denial of benefits?

417. The ECT is an international treaty. Its interpretation is governed by the rules of international

508

509

law expressed in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT. Both Parties have made arguments on this
basis. The Parties have also extensively referred to arbitral decisions that have previously
considered the interpretation of Article 17 of the ECT. While the Tribunal does not believe that
it is bound to follow the precedent of any prior relevant arbitral decisions, the Tribunal
considers that it has a duty to take account of these decisions, in the hope of contributing to the
formation of a consistent interpretation of the ECT capable of enhancing the ability of investors

to predict the investment protections which they can expect to benefit from under the Treaty.

to deny the advantages of Part III to Khan Netherlands in this case.”

89

PCA Case No. 2011-09

Decision on Jurisdiction

418. In accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT, the Tribunal seeks to interpret Article 17(1) “in
good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in

their context and in light of its object and purpose.”

419. Article 17(1) of the ECT provides that the Contracting Party “reserves the right” to deny the
benefits of Part III of the ECT. The ordinary meaning of the verb “to reserve” suggests that the
right to deny the benefits of the Treaty is being kept by the Contracting Party, to be exercised in
the future.*'° Had Article 17 been intended to deny benefits automatically, it could easily have
been phrased to do so. A formulation such as: “The advantages of Part III of the ECT shall be
denied to” would have made such meaning plain. This leads the Tribunal to conclude that the

Contracting Party’s right to deny the benefits of Part III of the ECT must be exercised actively.

420. Article 1(7) of the ECT contains a broad definition of what counts as an “Investor” for purposes
of the Treaty. If Article 17(1) were to provide for an automatic denial of benefits, it would
effectively create an exception to this broad definition. Such exception would more logically be

found within the definition at Article 1(7) itself.

421. The interpretation that Article 17 requires an active exercise of the Contracting Party’s right to
deny the benefits of Part III of the ECT is in line with the Treaty’s object and purpose. Article 2
of the ECT describes its purpose to establish “a legal framework in order to promote long-term
cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual benefits.” The
provision of an option to deny the benefits of Part III of the ECT furthers this goal of “long-
term cooperation,” as it creates an incentive to join the Treaty for states with a variety of
policies with respect to legal entities that fall within the definition of Article 17(1). Thus, both
states that wish to attract the investment of such legal entities, and those that do not wish to
extend investment protections to such entities, are encouraged to become Contracting Parties.
The expression “mutual benefits” of Article 2 of the ECT refers to the receipt of a benefit by

each Contracting Party, but does not imply that such benefits must be coextensive.

422. Both the Plama and Yukos tribunals, faced with precisely the same question of whether the
Contracting Party must actively exercise its right under Article 17(1) of the ECT, answered in

the affirmative.

423. Concerning the manner in which the host state’s right may be exercised, the Tribunal concurs
with the Plama tribunal in that:
[t]he exercise [of the Contracting State's right to deny benefits under Article 17(1) of the ECT]

would necessarily be associated with publicity or other notice so as to become reasonably
available to investors and their advisers. To this end, a general declaration in a Contracting

Decision on Jurisdiction

State’s official gazette could suffice; or a statutory provision in a Contracting State’s
i tment or other laws; or even an exchange of letters with a particular investor or class of
. Given that in practice an investor must distinguish between Contracting States with
different state practices, it is not unreasonable or impractical to interpret Article 17(1) as
requiring that a Contracting State must exercise its right before applying it to an investor and
be seen to have done so.”

  

Once it is found that the Article 17(1) right must be actively exercised, the question arises of
whether in the present case Mongolia has in fact exercised its right. While Mongolia does not
clearly point to a moment when it exercised its right to deny the benefits of Part III of the

Treaty to Khan Netherlands, the Tribunal accepts the implication of Mongolia’s argument that

 

in raising this objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, Mongolia is in fact exercising its right
under Article 17(1). The question then remains of whether the Article 17(1) right may be
effectively exercised toward a particular investor after the investor in question commences

international arbitration against the host state.

Whether the Contracting Party’s right to deny benefits under Article 17 of the ECT may be

exercised after commencement of the arbitration

In the Tribunal’s view, this question of interpretation is not solved by reference to the terms of
Article 17(1). It is therefore necessary to investigate with particular attention the “object and

purpose” of the Treaty.

The Treaty seeks to create a predictable legal framework for investments in the energy field.
This predictability materializes only if investors can know in advance whether they are entitled
to the protections of the Treaty. If an investor such as Khan Netherlands, who falls within the
definition of “Investor” at Article 1(7) of the Treaty and is therefore entitled to the Treaty’s
protections in principle, could be denied the benefit of the Treaty at any moment after it has
invested in the host country, it would find itself in a highly unpredictable situation. This lack of
certainty would impede the investor’s ability to evaluate whether or not to make an investment

in any particular state. This would be contrary to the Treaty’s object and purpose.

In contrast, an obligation for contracting parties to exercise their Article 17 right in time to give
adequate notice to investors would be consistent with the obligation of host states under

Article 10(1) of the Treaty to create “transparent conditions” for investments.
In this respect the Plama tribunal stated as follows:

The covered investor enjoys the advantages of Part III unless the host state exercises its right
under Article 17(1) ECT; and a putative covered investor has legitimate expectations of such
advantages until that right’s exercise. A putative investor therefore requires reasonable notice
before making any investment in the host state whether or not that host state has exercised its
rights under Article 17(1) ECT. At that stage, the putative investor can so plan its business

affairs to come within or without the criteria there specified, as it chooses. It can also plan not
to make any investment at all or to make it elsewhere. After an investment is made in the host
state the “hostage-factor” is introduced; the covered investor’s choices are accordingly more
limited; and the investor is correspondingly more vulnerable to the host state’s exercise of its
right under Article 17(1) ECT. At this time, therefore, the covered investor needs at least the
same protection as it enjoyed as a putative investor able to plan its investment. The ECT’s
express “purpose” under Article 2 ECT is... . It is difficult to see how any retrospective
effect is consistent with this “long-term” purpose.”*

  

  

It is difficult to imagine that any Contracting Party, whatever its general policy regarding
mailbox companies, would refrain from exercising its right to deny the substantive protections
of the ECT to an investor who has already commenced arbitration and is claiming a substantial
sum of money. A good faith interpretation does not permit the Tribunal to choose a
construction of Article 17 that would allow host states to lure investors by ostensibly extending
to them the protections of the ECT, to then deny these protections when the investor attempts to
invoke them in international arbitration.

The Respondents invoke the Petrobart and Amto decisions to assert that there is no settled

conflict with its interpretation of this provision. The Amto tribunal considered that Article 17(1)
requires the active exercise of the Contracting Party’s right, stating, among other, that the
investor falling within the definition of Article 17(1) has “a defeasible right to investment
protection under the ECT, because the host State of the investment has the power to divest” the
investor of his right and referring to the “potential” exclusion of the investor from ECT

investment protection.

The Amro tribunal then found it unnecessary to address the question of
when the Contracting Party must exercise its Article 17 right, as in any event the claimant in
that case did not satisfy the substantive criteria of Article 17(1). For the same reason, the

Petrobart tribunal did not address the question of interpretation of Article 17(1)."°

For the above reasons, the Tribunal finds that Article 17(1) of the ECT does not operate in the

present case to bar Khan Netherlands from invoking the protections of the ECT.

THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION OVER THE CLAIMANTS’ CLAIMS UNDER THE
FOREIGN INVESTMENT LAW

The only question left for determination by the Tribunal is whether it has jurisdiction over

Khan’s claim that the Respondents have breached the Foreign Investment Law.

Article 25 of the Foreign Investment Law provides:

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction

Settlement of Disputes

Disputes between foreign investors and Mongolian investors as well as between foreign

investors and Mongolian legal or natural persons on the matters relating to foreign investment

and the operations of the foreign invested business entity shall be resolved in the Courts of

Mongolia unless provided otherwise by international treaties to which Mongolia is a party or

by any contract between the parties.
In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondents incorrectly emphasize this provision’s reference to the
courts of Mongolia. Article 25 does not preclude the submission of breach of the Foreign
Investment Law claims to international arbitration. On the contrary, Article 25 authorizes the
resolution of disputes concerning foreign investment in international arbitration where a

relevant treaty or contract provides for this method of dispute resolution.

However, Article 25 does not constitute an independent basis for a recourse to arbitration.
Rather, it refers to relevant treaties and contracts. Accordingly, in order for the Tribunal to have
jurisdiction over Khan’s claims of breach of provisions of the Foreign Investment Law, these
claims must fall within the scope of the relevant arbitration clauses, namely, Article 12 of the

Founding Agreement and Article 26 of the ECT.

The Tribunal finds that Khan Canada’s and CAUC Holding’s Foreign Investment Law claims
fall within the broad scope of Article 12 of the Founding Agreement, as they, like the breach of
fiduciary duty and international obligations claims discussed in section D(ii) and (iii) of the
Tribunal’s analysis, arise out the relationship between the Parties defined by the Founding

Agreement.

Phrased less broadly than Article 12 of the Founding Agreement, Article 26 of the ECT
provides only for the resolution of disputes that “concern an alleged breach of an obligation of
[a Contracting Party] under Part III” of the ECT. This formulation cannot encompass disputes
arising out of the breach of other legal instruments, such as the Foreign Investment Law. The
Claimants, however, invoke Article 10(1) of the ECT to bring Khan Netherlands’ Foreign
Investment Law claims within the scope of Article 26 of the ECT. The last sentence of Article
10(1) of the ECT, the Treaty’s so-called “umbrella” provision, reads as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an
Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.

The Claimants submit that the terms “any obligations” encompass the statutory obligations of

    

the host state and in this case, Mongolia’s obligations under the Foreign Investment Law.*'®
Given the ordinary meaning of the term “any” and the fact that the Respondents have not

submitted any arguments or authorities to the contrary, the Tribunal accepts the Claimants’

*'6 Counter-memorial, para. 446, n. 564.

93

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Decision on Jurisdiction

interpretation of Article 10(1) of the ECT. It follows that a breach by Mongolia of any
obligations it may have under the Foreign Investment Law would constitute a breach of the
provisions of Part III of the Treaty. Consequently, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction
under the ECT over Khan Netherlands’ Foreign Investment Law claims.

VIII. DECISION

439. For all the reasons stated above, and rejecting all contentions to the contrary, the Tribunal:
(a) DISMISSES all of the Respondents’ objections to jurisdiction;

(b) FINDS jurisdiction over all of the Claimants’ claims under the Founding Agreement

and the Energy Charter Treaty; and

(c) RESERVES for subsequent determination all questions concerning the merits, and all
questions relating to the costs of and incidental to the jurisdictional phase of these

proceedings, including the Parties’ costs of legal representation.
