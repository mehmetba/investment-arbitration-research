INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the ““Centre’”) by Ansung Housing Co., Ltd. (“Ansung”
or “Claimant”), a privately-owned company incorporated under the laws of the Republic
of Korea, against the People’s Republic of China (“China” or “Respondent’”). Claimant
and Respondent shall be referred to collectively as the “Parties.” Claimant and

Respondent shall be each referred to as a “Party.”

The dispute relates to Ansung’s investment in a golf course and condominium
development project in Sheyang-Xian, China. This dispute was submitted to ICSID on
the basis of the Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of Korea and the
Government of the People’s Republic of China on the Promotion and Protection of
Investments that entered into force on December 1, 2007 (“China-Korea BIT” or
“Treaty”), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States
and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (“ICSID

Convention”).

Before the First Session, China filed “Respondent’s Objection Pursuant to ICSID
Arbitration Rule 41(5)” (“Rule 41(5) Objection” or “41(5) Objection”), contending that
Ansung’s claim “is manifestly without legal merit.” Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Rules of
Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (“Arbitration Rules” or “ICSID Arbitration Rules”
or “Rules”) provides that the Tribunal “after giving the parties the opportunity to present
their observations on the objection, shall, at the first session or promptly thereafter notify

the parties of its decision on the objection.”

The Tribunal conducted the First Session and a hearing on the Rule 41(5) Objection on
December 14, 2016 (“Rule 41(5) Hearing” or “Hearing”). This Award embodies the
Tribunal’s decision upholding China’s Rule 41(5) Objection, which the Tribunal relayed
to the Parties in summary form at the end of the Hearing. Following the letter and spirit
of Rule 41(5), the Tribunal determined to provide an oral ruling to save the Parties

unnecessary time and resources post-Hearing.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Notice of Intent

On May 19, 2014, pursuant to Article 9(5) of the Treaty, Claimant submitted a written
notice of intent to arbitrate (“Notice of Intent”), including an invitation to discuss
amicable resolution of the dispute, to Respondent’s President, H.E. Xi Jinping, and other

senior officials.!_ Respondent did not respond and no discussions ensued.

Request for Arbitration

On October 7, 2014, ICSID received an electronic copy of a request for arbitration dated
October 7, 2014 from Ansung against China together with Exhibits C-001 through C-008,
which was supplemented by Claimant’s letters of October 27, 2014 and November 3,
2014 (“RFA” or “Request” or “Request for Arbitration”). The ICSID Secretariat
received a hard copy of the Request on October 8, 2014.

On November 3, 2014, Ansung submitted a letter to the ICSID Secretary-General

(“Secretary-General”) in response to her request for additional information on the claim.

On November 4, 2014, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that she registered the
Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. The Secretary-
General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible
in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of
Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (“ICSID Institution Rules” or “Institution

Rules”).

Tribunal Constitution

In the absence of an agreement between the Parties on the method of constituting the
Tribunal, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in Article

37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.

1-005, Letter dated 19 May 2014 from Bae, Kim & Lee LLC to H.E. Xi Jinping enclosing Notice of Intent for
International Arbitration.

On February 4, 2014, Dr. Michael Pryles, an Australian national, accepted his
appointment by Claimant as arbitrator, and Mr. J. Christopher Thomas, Q.C., a Canadian

national, accepted his appointment by Respondent as arbitrator.

ICSID Convention, as presiding arbitrator.

On September 2, 2016, the Secretary-General, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule
6(1), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that

proceeding. Among other things, the Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly

constituted? and agreed to the following procedural matters:

Post-Hearing Procedure

On January 17, 2017, as directed by the Tribunal at the end of the First Session, each
Party submitted a Statement of Costs, with the Claimant submitting Legal Authorities
CLA-025 through CLA-028 with its Statement of Costs.

submission on costs rather than the costs statement requested by the Tribunal. On
January 23, 2017, the Tribunal authorized Respondent to file any responsive submissions.
Respondent filed its Observations on Claimant’s Submission on Costs (“Respondent’s
Observations on Costs”) together with Legal Authorities RLA-041 through RLA-046 on

Ill. LEGAL TEXTS
28. ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) and (6) provides:

(5) Unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure
for making preliminary objections, a party may, no later than 30
days after the constitution of the Tribunal, and in any event before
the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is
manifestly without legal merit. The party shall specify as precisely
as possible the basis for the objection. The Tribunal, after giving
the parties the opportunity to present their observations on the
objection, shall, at its first session or promptly thereafter, notify the
parties of its decision on the objection. The decision of the
Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to file an
objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or to object, in the course of
the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit.

(6) If the Tribunal decides that the dispute is not within the
jurisdiction of the Centre or not within its own competence, or that
all claims are manifestly without legal merit, it shall render an
award to that effect.

29. Article 9 of the China-Korea BIT, headed “Settlement of Disputes Between Investors and

One Contracting Party,” provides in relevant part:

1. For the purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a
dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party that has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or
arising out of, an alleged breach of this Agreement with respect to
an investment of an investor of that other Contracting Party.

3. In case of international arbitration, the dispute shall be
submitted, at the option of the investor, to:

(a) International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID) under the Convention on the Settlement of Disputes
between States and Nationals of Other States, done at
Washington on March 18, 1965; or

(b) an ad hoc arbitration tribunal established under
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules or any other arbitration rules
agreed upon by both parties;

provided that the Contracting Party involved in the dispute may
require the investor concerned to go through the domestic
administrative review procedures specified by the laws and
regulations of that Contracting Party before the submission to
international arbitration.

The domestic administrative review procedures shall not exceed
four months from the date an application for the review is first
filed including the time required for documentation. If the
procedures are not completed by the end of the four months, it
shall be considered that the procedures are complete and the
investor may proceed to an international arbitration. The investor
may file an application for the review during the four months
consultation or negotiation period as provided in paragraph 2 of
this Article.

Each Contracting Party hereby gives its consent for submission by
the investor concerned of the investment dispute for settlement by
binding international arbitration.

5. An investor submitting an investment dispute pursuant to
paragraph 3 of this Article shall give to the Contracting Party in
dispute a written notice of intent to do so at least ninety days
before the claim is submitted. The notice of intent shall specify:

(a) the name and address of the investors concerned;

(b) the specific measures at issue of such Contracting Party in
dispute and a brief summary of the factual and legal basis of
the investment dispute sufficient to present the problem clearly,
including the provisions of this Agreement alleged to have
been breached;

(c) the relief sought including, as necessary, the approximate
amount of damages claimed; and

(d) the dispute-settlement procedures set forth in paragraph 3
(a) to (b) of this Article which the investor concerned will seek.

7. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article,
an investor may not make a claim pursuant to paragraph 3 of this
Article if more than three years have elapsed from the date on
which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired,
knowledge that the investor had incurred loss or damage.*

30. Article 3 of the China-Korea BIT, headed “Treatment of Investment” (“Most-Favoured-

Nation Treatment” or “MFN Clause’’), provides:

3. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investors
of the other Contracting Party and to their investments and
activities associated with such investments by the investors of the
other Contracting Party treatment no less favourable than that
accorded in like circumstances to the investors and investments
and associated activities by the investors of any third State
(hereinafter referred to as “most-favoured-nation treatment”) with
respect to investments and business activities [defined in paragraph
1 as “the expansion, operation, management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment, and sale or other disposal of investments”], including
the admission of investment.

5. Treatment accorded to investors of one Contracting Party within
the territory of the other Contracting Party with respect to access to
the courts of justice and administrative tribunals and authorities
both in pursuit and in defence of their rights shall not be less
favourable than that accorded to investors of the latter Contracting
Party or to investors of any third State.°

31. Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“WCLT’’) provides:

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

For purposes of ruling on Respondent’s Rule 41(5) Objection, the Tribunal assumes the
truth of the facts alleged by Claimant. The factual background set out below therefore
comes from Ansung’s Notice of Intent, Request for Arbitration, First and Second
Observations on the Rule 41(5) Objection, and oral submissions at the Rule 41(5)

Hearing.

In April 2005 and April 2006, Mr. Jin Woo Pae, Ansung’s CEO, attended several
presentations held in Korea by representatives from Yancheng-Shi, China, where he
learned about possible investment opportunities to develop and operate a golf course in

the Yancheng-Shi district.’

On or around September 13, 2006, Ansung identified a 1,500 mu parcel of land® for a
project in Sheyang-Xian (a sub-district of Yancheng-Shi) that had been partially
developed by a joint venture company called “Sheyang Seashore International Golf

Course Co. Ltd.” (“Sheyang Seashore”).”

In November 2006, Ansung’s management decided to build a golf resort in Sheyang-
Xian by acquiring the Sheyang Seashore joint venture. Ansung planned to build a 27-
hole golf course and related facilities on 3,000 mu, which included Sheyang Seashore’s
1,500 mu land and an additional 1,500 mu in adjacent lands. Ansung filed an application
with the Communist Party of the Sheyang Harbor Industrial Zone Administration
Committee (“Committee”) to obtain an investment approval from the local Sheyang-Xian
government, which application attached a report outlining Ansung’s overall scheme for a

golf course project with more than 18 holes and not more than 36 holes. !°

On December 12, 2006, Ansung entered into an Investment Agreement with the

Committee “under which the Committee acknowledged that the related authorities of

Animal Husbandry and Fisheries General Company. RFA, para. 23.

"RFA,

Jiangsu-Sheng and Sheyang-Xian had approved the development of the 1,500 mu”
(referred to as the “first phase” of the project), with “1,200 mu, for the development of an
18-hole golf course and 300 mw for related facilities.”'! The related facilities were to be
luxury condominiums and a clubhouse to house employees and serve administrative
functions.'2_ The Investment Agreement also provided that the Committee “would

reserve an additional 1,500 mu adjacent to the first phase land,” as the joint venture
“intended to develop another 9-hole golf course on that 1500 mu once the first phase of

the project had been completed” (the “second phase” of the project). '°

As requested by the Committee, on January 16, 2007, Ansung’s officers briefed local
government officials on Ansung’s “master plan” to build a 27-hole golf course on 3,000
mu.'+ On January 29, 2007, Ansung’s officers met with Committee Secretary You Dao-
jun to ask whether the local government could provide the entire 3,000 mu at the outset,
but Secretary You informed the officers that “the government would provide the
additional 1,500 mu for the second phase immediately after the completion of the first

phase.”!°

On March 5, 2007, Ansung commenced construction work for the first phase of the
project. Throughout the work, blueprints and concept drawings for the 27-hole golf

course and related facilities were posted in front of the construction site.'®

In March 2007, shortly after initiating construction of the first phase, Ansung observed
that a nearby park called “Sheyang Island Park,” which was to be operated by a Chinese

company, was apparently being developed as a golf course. '7

On April 5, 2007, Ansung’s CEO, Mr. Jin Woo Pae, expressed his concern to Committee

Secretary You Dao-jun about “the illegal development of a golf course in Sheyang Island

Park.”'® Secretary You reassured him that no other golf course could be legally
developed or operated in Sheyang-Xian and Sheyang Island Park was being developed as
an amusement park.!? In April and May 2007, several other local government officials
confirmed Secretary You’s message about the nature of development in Sheyang Island

Park.??

On or around June 27, 2007, when Ansung requested the 300 mu necessary for the related
facilities for the first phase, Secretary You explained that China had changed its real
estate policy so the Committee could no longer provide the land at the price stipulated in
the Investment Agreement and Ansung would have to apply for land use rights through a
public sale at higher prices. He informed Ansung that the joint venture would not be
eligible to develop a clubhouse and condominiums on this 300 mu without establishing a

Chinese subsidiary.”!

On July 10, 2007, after further discussions with Secretary You, Ansung established a
Chinese company, “Sheyang Mirage Field Co., Ltd.” (“Mirage”), for the sole purpose of

building a clubhouse and condominiums on the 300 mu as part of the first phase.”

On May 20, 2008, the Committee requested Ansung, through Mirage, to agree to pay a
substantially higher price for the 300 mu. Given its already substantial investment and
the importance of a clubhouse, “despite the Committee’s outright repudiation of the
Investment Agreement, Ansung had no alternative but to build the clubhouse” by paying

the higher price.”

On May 27, 2008, the Sheyang-Xian government awarded Ansung the land use rights for
100 mu at a price higher than originally agreed, and refused to provide the further 200

mu. This left Ansung unable to develop the condominiums.”*

On June 30, 2009, with the first phase almost complete, the Committee arranged for a
third-party development company to loan funds to Mirage to expedite construction of the

clubhouse.”°

In August 2009, Ansung learned that Sheyang Island Park had become an operating 18-
hole golf course, and complained to various government officials.7° Although the
officials represented that they would intervene, “it is clear that the Sheyang-Xian
government took no measures to enjoin the illegal operation of the golf course in the Park

as it has been illegally operating the golf course up to the present date.”?”

Ansung completed the 18-hole first phase of the project in November 2010. At that time,
Ansung repeatedly requested the Committee to provide the additional land necessary for
the second phase, in order to avoid bearing costly construction-related expenses, but
“officials avoided giving clear answers and only advised Ansung to wait” or rejected

Ansung’s meeting requests.*

On March 24, 2011, Ansung’s Chairman Jin Woo Pae visited Secretary Xu Chao, the
Communist Party Secretary of Sheyang-Xian, to request the additional land. Chairman
Pae received assurances from Secretary Xu that he would “take the steps necessary to
address the problem.”?? On March 25, 2011, “the very next day, Secretary You contacted
Chairman Pae to inform him that Secretary Xu...had no authority to address the

issue...and he was the only person with the actual power to handle all land-related issues

in this project” and, yet, Secretary You took no action and thereafter “he has refused to

meet with Ansung for any matter.”*°

In June 2011, Mirage was unable to repay the loan arranged by the Committee, because,
with only an 18-hole golf course, “Ansung was unable to produce sufficient returns from
its investments in the JV and Mirage as to justify their continued existence. ..[or]
contribute additional financing from Korea into its Subsidiaries, including Mirage, given
the Sheyang-Xian government’s manifest failure to honor its aforementioned

commitments and assurances.”*!

Also in June 2011, Ansung employees reported that Committee officials visited the golf
course to demand repayment of the debt by “unlawful means” such as “‘blockad[ing] the
main gate of the golf course and even assault[ing] Ansung’s employees,” with requests
for police protection going unheeded, “leaving Ansung’s officers and employees in

perpetual danger.” *?

Without the planned full 27-hole golf course with luxury condominiums, and facing the
competing illegal golf course at Sheyang Island Park and harassment by local officials,
Ansung found itself unable to sell memberships to the golf course and hence “incapable
of sustaining a profitable and stable golf business in Sheyang-Xian.”*? Consequently, in
October 2011, ““Ansung had no alternative but to dispose of its entire assets of the golf
business, including its shareholding in [Mirage], to a Chinese purchaser at a price
significantly lower than the amount that Ansung had invested toward the project, causing

serious financial losses and damage to Ansung.”**

52. As also pleaded in the introduction to the Request for Arbitration: “As a consequence of
the foregoing, Ansung was forced to dispose of its entire investment in Sheyang-Xian in

October 2011 in order to avoid further losses.”

53. The factual background in Claimant’s Request for Arbitration ends at October 2011. In
Ansung’s letter of November 3, 2014 to the ICSID Secretary-General and in its First
Observations, Ansung describes the sales transactions that it alleges took place in

November and December 2011.

54. Ansung provides the following description of events in its November 3, 2014 letter:

a) “On 2 November 2011, Claimant entered into a share transfer agreement with a
Chinese purchaser to sell its shareholdings in the Subsidiaries. However, the

agreement did not set a fixed price for the share transfer.”

b

“On 17 December 2011, the parties reached agreement on the final price for the
transfer arrangement as well as the date on which the transfer would occur; and
this was reduced to writing and reflected in an instrument called a ‘supplementary

THE PARTIES’ MAIN POSITIONS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

Summary of the Parties’ Positions

Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), Respondent objects that Ansung’s claims
under the China-Korea BIT “manifestly lack legal merit and should be dismissed,”
because Ansung instituted this ICSID arbitration more than three years after it first
acquired knowledge that it had incurred loss or damage, rendering the claim time-barred
under Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT.** The MEN Clause in the Treaty cannot save

Ansung’s untimely claim.*?

Claimant advances that Respondent’s Rule 41(5) Objection itself “lacks any legal merit
and should be denied,” because: “(i) [Respondent] fails to show that Ansung’s knowledge
of loss or damage is manifestly incapable of satisfying the time requirement of Article
9(7) of the China-Korea BIT, and (ii) regardless of the tribunal’s determination on the (i)
above, the China-Korea BIT’s MFN clause applies so as to allow Ansung to take
advantage of more favorable treatment in third party BITs with respect to the time
requirement.”*° Ansung argues that if the facts it asserts are taken as true, its claim meets
the three-year prescription period because it served its Notice of Intent two-and-a-half

years after it could have known the losses incurred. Ansung contends that, at best,

China’s allegations that its claims are time-barred demand further factual and legal

scrutiny at a later stage and cannot be considered “manifestly” meritless.*!

In outlining the Parties’ respective positions in the sections below, the Tribunal does not
express or imply any view regarding the merits of any arguments advanced by either

Party.

Requests for Relief

Respondent requests an award in its favor: (a) dismissing with prejudice all claims made
by Ansung in the Request for Arbitration; (b) ordering Ansung to pay China’s legal fees
incurred in connection with this arbitration; (c) ordering Ansung to pay the fees of the
Centre and the Tribunal; and (d) ordering post-Award interest on all sums awarded at a

commercially reasonable rate to be set by the Tribunal.*”

Respondent also requests that, in the event the Tribunal decides it must hear evidence
before definitively resolving the application of Article 9(7) to these proceedings, the
Tribunal order this question to be heard as a preliminary question pursuant to ICSID

Arbitration Rule 41(4).7

Claimant requests a decision: (a) denying Respondent’s 41(5) Objection, if possible at the
First Session; and (b) ordering Respondent to reimburse Claimant for all costs and
expenses incurred by Claimant for the First and Second Observations on Respondent’s
41(5) Objection, including but not limited to fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID,

legal counsel, and Claimant’s own officers and employees.“

THE LEGAL STANDARD FOR ICSID ARBITRATION RULE 41(5) AND (6)

Respondent’s Position

Respondent recites that ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) provides for early dismissal of
claims that are “manifestly without legal merit,” and the Tribunal must render an award
under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(6) if it finds either that the dispute is not within the
Centre’s jurisdiction or that the claims are “manifestly without legal merit.”4
Respondent relies on the Rule 41(5) analysis of the ICSID tribunal in Trans-Global
Petroleum v. Jordan (“Trans-Global’), which subsequent tribunals have cited with

approval:

[T]he ordinary meaning of the word [“manifestly”] requires the
respondent to establish its objection clearly and obviously, with
relative ease and despatch. The standard is thus set high. Given
the nature of investment disputes generally, the Tribunal
nonetheless recognizes that this exercise may not always be
simple....The exercise may thus be complicated; but it should
never be difficult.“

Respondent, again citing to Trans-Global, posits that a Rule 41(5) decision would
“assume the truth of the factual allegations in the request for arbitration unless a given
factual obligation was manifestly ‘incredible, frivolous, vexatious or inaccurate or made
in bad faith.’””4” China asserts that Ansung erroneously suggests that a claim can survive
a Rule 41(5) challenge “if a tribunal is of the opinion that...the facts in the claim are not
patently frivolous or absurd.”*® According to Respondent, the question under Rule 41(5)
instead is “whether, assuming the truth of the credible allegations made, the claim fails as

a matter of law.”*?

confirmed, any legal defect in the claim may be the subject of a Rule 41(5) application, whether concerning the
tribunal’s jurisdiction or the merits.”).

Global”).

When considering Rule 41(5) applications, Respondent explains that “tribunals weigh the
right granted to the respondent ‘to have a patently unmeritorious claim disposed of before
unnecessary trouble and expense is incurred in defending it’ against the general

requirements of due process.”*”

With respect to Claimant’s reliance on the Secretary-General’s registration of the
Request, Respondent notes that ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) was proposed to
complement the Secretary-General’s screening powers, so registration does not prejudge

the Rule 41(5) question presented to the Tribunal.*!

Unlike the short registration process,
which considers only the claimant’s ex parte submissions, the Rule 41(5) procedure has a
“full, adversary exploration of the relevant legal principles.”°? Respondent further notes
that an article written by a member of the working group that prepared the Rule 41
amendments recognized that temporal objections were appropriate for resolution under

Rule 41(5).3

Claimant’s Position

Claimant, like Respondent, relies on the Trans-Global decision to interpret the scope of
ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), but contends that the Trans-Global tribunal “held that the
provision applied only to clear and obvious cases of ‘patently unmeritorious claims.’”**
Ansung concurs with China’s reliance on that tribunal’s elucidation of the meaning of the
adjective “manifestly,” by requiring the respondent to establish its objection “clearly and
obviously, with relative ease and despatch.”*> Claimant concludes that, to meet the
necessary element of “manifestly,” “Respondent must pass a demanding and rigorous test

by demonstrating that its objection has such clarity, certainty, and obviousness.”*°

Claimant further argues that, “for the purpose of the 41(5) Objection, if a tribunal is of
the opinion that (i) the facts in the claim are not patently frivolous or absurd, and (ii) the
tribunal would not be able to decide the questions presented to it without an in-depth
scrutiny of factual allegations, then it must resolve such a factual question in favour of

the claimant and reject the 41(5) Objection.”*”

Claimant asserts that the factual background set out in its Notice of Intent and Request
for Arbitration meets the temporal requirement of Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT at
a prima facie level.** Furthermore, according to Ansung, a Rule 41(5) objection is not
appropriate for contesting the existence of temporal jurisdiction, as further factual

disclosure is required for a proper assessment of this objection.*?

Claimant also asserts that “[g]iven that the ICSID Secretary-General registered Ansung’s
Request for Arbitration, this shows that from the Secretary-General’s perspective,

Ansung’s claim is not ‘manifestly outside the jurisdiction [of the Centre].’”°°

Tribunal’s Analysis

The test for a preliminary objection under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) is whether “a
claim is manifestly without legal merit.” The Tribunal agrees with the Parties that the
test of “manifestly” is well articulated by the Trans-Global tribunal, and so will require
Respondent to establish its objection “clearly and obviously, with relative ease and

despatch.”

In deciding the objection, the Tribunal accepts the facts as pleaded by Ansung. The
Tribunal need not decide China’s argument that it must ignore facts that are “incredible,
frivolous, vexatious or inaccurate or made in bad faith,” as it does not find that the facts

pleaded by Ansung fall into these categories.

With regard to the import of the Secretary-General’s registration of Ansung’s Request for
Arbitration, the Tribunal agrees with China that registration does not and cannot pre-
judge an application under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5). Registration follows the
Secretary-General’s early screening process, at which point she bases her registration
decision only “on the basis of the information contained in the request.”°! If registration
were to vouch for the manifest legal merit of a request for arbitration, Rule 41(5) would

never lead to early resolution and would serve no purpose.

Where a respondent’s Rule 41(5) objection is concerned with a limitation period, as
China’s is, a tribunal’s decision on such an objection constitutes a decision as
contemplated by Rule 41(6) regarding a lack of jurisdiction of the Centre and of its own
competence as well as regarding manifest lack of legal merit due to a lack of temporal

jurisdiction. As set out below, this is the situation here.

ARTICLE 9(7) OF THE CHINA-KOREA BIT - LIMITATION PERIOD
To recall, Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT provides:

[A]n investor may not make a claim pursuant to paragraph 3 of this
Article if more than three years have elapsed from the date on
which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired,
knowledge that the investor had incurred loss or damage.
Classically, the start date for such a temporal limitation period is known as the dies a quo

and the end date as the dies ad quem.

Respondent’s Position

D Dies a Quo

Turning first to the dies a quo for the prescription period in the Treaty, Respondent
emphasizes that Article 9(7) is precise in setting the dies a quo as “the date on which the

investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge that the investor had

incurred loss or damage.” Relying on prior decisions by NAFTA tribunals interpreting
the substantially similar time limitation language in the NAFTA, China argues that the
Treaty Article 9(7) language addresses “knowledge of the fact that there has been a loss,
not knowledge of the quantum lost.”*+ Moreover, Respondent asserts, “a claimant may
not rely only on loss from the last of a series of similar and related State actions alleged

to constitute a breach.”°>

77. Accepting the facts set out in Claimant’s Request for Arbitration, Respondent asserts that
Ansung “necessarily knew of the fact that it had incurred loss or damage on some date
prior to the disposal of its investment in October 2011,” the date on which Ansung sold
its entire investment in Sheyang-Xian “in order to avoid further losses.” According to
Respondent, the Tribunal need not decide an exact date because the first date of losses

(being earlier losses) necessarily was prior to October 2011.7

78. In Respondent’s Observations, China underscores that Ansung has attempted to change
its story in its First Observations by concentrating on “a continuing omission” by the
local government in late 2011, as opposed to allegations in the Request for Arbitration
that the Committee began affirmatively breaching the Investment Agreement by

withholding land in 2007, and engaged in “outright repudiation” in 2008 by forcing

© R. 41(5) Obj., paras. 24-25 (emphasis in original). Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA provides: “An investor may
not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should
have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.”
5 R. 41(5) Obj., para. 25 (citing RLA-008, Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of
America, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, para. 81 (Decision on Jurisdiction, July 20, 2006) (“Grand River”)). Similarly,
Respondent cites to the United States Article 1128 submission in Eli Lilly. v. Canada:

 

 

 

An investor or enterprise first acquires knowledge of an alleged breach and loss at a
particular moment in time; that is, under Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2), knowledge is
acquired as of a particular “date.” Such knowledge cannot first be acquired at multiple
points in time or on a recurring basis. ... Accordingly, once a claimant first acquires (or
should have first acquired) knowledge of breach and loss, subsequent transgressions by
the State Party arising from a continuing course of conduct do not renew the limitations
period under Articles 1116(2) or Article 1117(2).

Ansung to pay a higher price for use of the 300 mu.®* Respondent also asserts that, in
Claimant’s First Observations, Ansung modified, without explanation, its story that it
disposed of its investment in October 2011 by alleging that it began negotiations with an
unnamed Chinese individual at an unspecified time and finally agreed to transfer its

shares at the agreed price only on December 17, 2011.

79. China contests Ansung’s belated reliance on December 17, 2011 as the dies a quo.
According to Respondent, although this may have been the date Ansung fully liquidated
and realized its losses, it is not the date on which “Ansung first knew or should have
known that its project incurred a loss.””° Citing to prior decisions including Mondev
International Ltd. v. United States, China contends that Claimant’s assertions fail as a

matter of law because the three-year period commences when a claimant knows “of the

fact that some loss has occurred, not upon its full realization’”,”!

80. Respondent challenges Claimant’s “continuing omission” argument, first, for lack of
support in Ansung’s own allegations and the applicable jurisprudence.’? The alleged
breaches based on local government conduct between 2007 and 2010, for example the
demand for an increased price for the 300 mu, were not ones with continuing character

pursuant to the rules on State responsibility, as each breach was “complete even if it has

continuing ongoing effects....””> Respondent contends that Claimant cannot convert

these breaches into continuing breaches simply by alleging that it tried and failed to

resolve the situation.”

Second, China dismisses Ansung’s “continuing omission” justification that, as the
Committee did not explicitly repudiate its prior assurances to provide the additional 1,500
mu, Ansung’s original plan for a 27-hole golf course remained viable up to the date, in
mid-December 2011, that Ansung sold its phase one 18-hole golf course and clubhouse.’”>
In addition to being incoherent, Respondent considers this justification to be a legal
characterization of Ansung’s factual allegations that fails as a matter of law.’° If viewed
as an allegation of fact, however, China urges the Tribunal to disregard it as not

credible.””

From a legal perspective, Respondent asserts that tribunals have consistently rejected
similar theories of “continuing breach” through a “continuing omission” for purposes of
calculating a limitations period.”* For example, as in Corona v. Dominican Republic,
Claimant relies in this case on the local government’s absence of action for its
“continuing omission” theory; however, as in Corona v. Dominican Republic, “that
silence did not ‘produc[e] any separate effects on [the] investment other than those that

were already produced by the initial decision[s]’ and acts.””

Moreover, even if considered “continuing acts,” China emphasizes that Ansung’s final
transfer of shares on December 17, 2011 “would not change the fact that Ansung first
knew or should have known of the fact of loss from the breaches prior to 4 November

2011” or before October 2011.%°

Respondent also criticizes Claimant’s reliance on Pac Rim v. El Salvador, because that
case “did not even address application of a limitation period.”*! Nor can Ansung rely on

UPS v. Canada, as that case addressed a textually different limitation clause that required

knowledge of both breach and loss, and the tribunal’s approach has been “severely
criticized and not followed by later tribunals.”*? Most recently, in Spence v. Costa Rica,

the tribunal found:

While it may be that a continuing course of conduct constitutes a

continuing breach, the Tribunal considers that such conduct cannot

without more renew the limitation period as this would effectively

denude the delimitation clause of its essential purpose, namely, to

draw a line under the prosecution of historic claims. Such an

approach would also encourage attempts at the endless parsing up

of a claim into ever finer sub-components of breach over time in an

attempt to come within the limitation period. This does not

comport with the policy choice of the parties to the treaty.**
Finally, Respondent argues that Claimant’s interpretation of Treaty Article 9(7) would
render that Article without effect. If a State’s inaction could itself renew a time limitation
period, or if final disposal of an investment were required for the limitation period to
begin, the investor would fully control when the period would start, thereby “rendering it

illusory” and undermining the legal stability served by limitation periods. **

2) Dies ad Quem

Turning to the dies ad quem for the three-year limitation period, Respondent argues that
the end date must be November 4, 2014, the date on which ICSID registered Claimant’s
Request for Arbitration.”®> This means that, on China’s case, the dies a quo had to have

been after November 4, 2011.

In support of its position, China recites that Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT refers to
“the date on which the ‘investor...make[s] a claim pursuant to paragraph 3 of this

Article,”®° and paragraph 3 of Article 9 in turn addresses how the dispute shall be

submitted to arbitration. Therefore, according to China, the dies ad quem “is when an

investor makes a claim in the sense of submitting the dispute to arbitration.”*”

 

88. In specific, China asserts that ICSID Institution Rule 6(2) precisely establishes when a
dispute is submitted and the proceeding begins: “[a] proceeding under the Convention
shall be deemed to have been instituted on the date of registration of the request.”*® When
an investor chooses ICSID arbitration, Institution Rule 6(2) “determines when an
‘investor...make[s] a claim pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article [9],’” because “in the
ICSID system there is no arbitration unless and until the Secretary-General registers the
request.”*? Applying Article 31 of the VCLT to interpret the plain terms of Treaty Article

9(3) and (7),°° China submits that an “investor does not make an ICSID claim or submit a

dispute to ICSID arbitration until that claim is registered by the Secretary-General.”*!

89. Respondent contests Claimant’s position that the date of the original Notice of Intent
constitutes “making a claim” within the meaning of Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT.

China insists that the provision is clear that “a claim is made only when the dispute is

992

submitted under the arbitration rules specified in Article 9(3).””* China disagrees that the

China-Korea BIT text can support Ansung’s efforts to draw a distinction between the

“claim” reference in Article 9(7) and “the dispute” reference under Article 9(3), as

3

Article 9(5) treats those terms as synonyms.”> Nor does China find any linguistic or

textual support for Claimant’s contention that there is a distinction between “making” and
“submitting” a claim in either the English, Korean or Chinese versions.** Citing Apotex
Inc. v. United States as an example, Respondent reiterates that prior tribunals interpreting

“substantially identical” provisions “have held that ‘making a claim’ refers to the

definitive activation of an arbitration procedure,” which a notice of intent could not

meet.”

China also challenges Ansung’s argument that ICSID claimants would be inconvenienced
if the plain terms of Article 9(7) were strictly applied, as prior tribunals have confirmed
that a limitation clause is “a legitimate legal mechanism to limit the proliferation of
historic claims” and “generations of NAFTA claimants have succeeded without difficulty

in navigating” such provisions.°°

Finally, Respondent asserts that Claimant errs in suggesting that China’s position is that
the Request’s transmission establishes the dies ad quem, and it reiterates its position that
under Article 9(7) of the Treaty a claim is made in an ICSID arbitration when the

proceedings are instituted, on the date of registration.”

3) Conclusion

In sum, Respondent submits that Claimant “instituted this ICSID arbitration more than
three years after the date on which it acquired knowledge that it had incurred loss or
damage.”** Based on Ansung’s own pleadings, it first learned that it incurred loss or
damage related to its Sheyang-Xian golf course project at some point before October
2011. This is more than three years before November 4, 2014, when ICSID registered
Ansung’s case. Consequently, “[u]nder the plain terms of Article 9(7)...[Ansung’s]
claim is barred by the text of the consent it relies upon to invoke the jurisdiction of this

Tribunal,” and “[tJhe lack of legal merit of its claims is manifest.”°?

Claimant’s Position

D Dies a Quo

To determine the proper start date for its claim, Ansung emphasizes that the China-Korea
BIT provides a cause of action in Article 9(1) for loss or damage arising from the breach

of the Treaty obligations, !°°

and “the loss or damage set out in Article 9(7) is also
understood to relate to those arising from the Respondent’s multiple breaches of the
China-Korea BIT.”!°! According to Ansung, it could ascertain its loss or damage under
Article 9(7) “only after its expectation and plan for the 27-hole golf course was
completely frustrated, owing primarily to the government’s continued inaction in

providing the additional land for the second phase of the Project.” !°?

Ansung alleges that it “obtained information assisting it in recognizing possible losses
only around December 17, 2011...when the circumstances leading to the losses became
unavoidable, thereby driving Ansung to sell the business to the Chinese purchaser.”!°
Therefore, the dies a quo for purposes of Treaty Article 9(7) must be December 17, 2011,
as the date when Claimant “first acquired or should have first acquired knowledge” of
loss or damage.'* This position, says Claimant, is consistent with the tribunal’s view in
Pope & Talbot, Inc. v. Canada that “actual damage, rather than predicted future damage”

is required to trigger a prescription period. !°

Claimant contests Respondent’s argument that it knew that it had incurred loss triggering
the limitation period by reason of local government action before October 2011.!°°
Ansung’s loss instead was a consequence of government inaction concerning the second

allotment of 1,500 mu of land, which inaction could not lead to a claimable loss while

Ansung continued to try to resolve the situation with the government.'°” Relying on Pac
Rim vy. El Salvador and UPS v. Canada, Claimant notes that continuing host State
omissions have been held to be treaty breaches, and such continuing omissions push the

temporal boundaries of the relevant limitation period. !°

In its Second Observations, Claimant asserts that “the key question to be examined
pursuant to Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT is when Ansung actually or
constructively acquired knowledge of the incurred losses resulting from the frustration of
its legitimate expectation.”!°° The answer alleged is that “[b]efore Ansung transferred its
shares in December 2011, Ansung could not know that its legitimate expectation [to
develop a 27-hole golf course and condominiums] was frustrated and, therefrom, it
incurred losses.”'!° Claimant contests Respondent’s position that the local government’s
failure to allot the second phase land must be characterized (for prescription purposes) as
a discrete breach that occurred before December 2011.''! According to Ansung, the
government “failed to provide the second phase land for more than a year without any
express repudiation and with even further assurance to give the land,” which “actually or

constructively matured into a breach only in mid-December 2011.”!!”

Similarly, Claimant maintains that even if the Tribunal should find that that the
government’s separate acts between 2007 and 2010 were severable breaches falling
before the three-year limitation period, the Tribunal would still have jurisdiction. This is
because such earlier breaches could not affect Ansung’s claims based on the local
government’s separate ongoing breach of its commitment to provide the second phase

land.1!3

Alternatively, and relying on UPS v. Canada, Ansung argues that the local government’s

continuing omission concerning the second phase land effectively renewed the three-year

period and “may render the first damage incurred from the renewed omission to fall
within the prescription period of the China-Korea BIT.”!'* Claimant challenges
Respondent’s efforts to undermine the UPS case and thereby avoid the application of the
continuing breach principle. Claimant also distinguishes the Corona case, where the host
State took an affirmative measure and thereafter remained silent in the face of the
claimant’s request that it reconsider the measure; in the present case, the government
never acted and instead simply withheld the second parcel of land, making it a

“continuing breach” of its promise.!!5

2) Dies ad Quem

According to Claimant, although Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT explicitly
precludes an investor from making a claim if the three-year time period has expired, the
Treaty does not define the meaning of the phrase “make a claim.”!'® Claimant posits that

“a claim is made when the notice of intent is submitted.”!!7

In support of its position, Ansung highlights Article 9(5) of the Treaty, which addresses
how an investment dispute may be settled. Article 9(5) requires that a claimant investor
provide a written notice of intent to the respondent State at least 90 days before its claim
can be “submitted” to arbitration.''® As its Notice of Intent and Request for Arbitration
are substantially similar and as, according to Ansung, a notice of intent clarifies the
nature of the dispute and the investor’s intention to resolve it, it is unreasonable to
calculate the limitation period from the date of the Request for Arbitration and reduce the

9

period by 90 days.'!? Moreover, Article 9(3) of the Treaty permits the respondent State

to require the investor to go through the domestic administrative review procedure for
four months before submission to international arbitration, which could reduce the

limitation by a further four months.!?° Given that, according to Ansung, the submission

of a dispute to arbitration is only “a formalistic process, whereas making the claim is the
more substantive step...the prescription period applies to the substantive step, i.e.
submitting the notice of intent.”'?! Finally, Ansung suggests that “a dispute is ‘a
disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interest’” and that
the notice of intent and the subsequent acts can help crystalize a “dispute,” which until
that point remains a “claim,” in order to support its view that “the prescription period

applies only to the notice of intent.” !??

In its Second Observations, Claimant reiterates its position that the end date must be the
date of its Notice of Intent, and adds that, in the alternative, this could be the date of the
filing of the Request for Arbitration. Claimant alleges that Respondent “fails to identify
any relevant authorities demonstrating that a registration date becomes the date when a
claim was first made,” and, by contrast, “there are supporting legal authorities that treat
the date of Notice of Intent or the filing date of the Request for Arbitration as the date for

making a claim.”!?°

Claimant reasserts that the China-Korea BIT distinguishes between a “claim” and a
“dispute.”!*4 For a claim to crystallize into a dispute, the investor must first give the
Respondent a “notice of intent” which will become a dispute when the respondent State

refuses the claim.'?°

Ansung argues that it first “made a claim” seeking relief for its
losses, for purposes of Article 9(3) of the Treaty, through its Notice of Intent to China on
May 19, 2014.'7° Ansung rejects China’s argument that the terms “investment dispute”
and “claim” are used synonymously and suggests that “while every dispute includes a
claim, every claim does not mature into a dispute.”!?? Claimant opposes Respondent’s
assertion that there is no distinction between “making” and “submitting” a claim, and

disagrees with the use of the Apotex and Feldman decisions on grounds that these

decisions do not interpret the phrase “make a claim” objectively, but rather in the context
of NAFTA provisions.'?® Ansung notes that the NAFTA uses “claims” consistently and
does not refer to “disputes,” so the NAFTA jurisprudence does not provide a useful

comparison.
Respondent “constitutes a failure to apply the rules of treaty interpretation in international

law and reduces the protections” granted by the Treaty. !7°

In the alternative, and citing Vannessa Ventures v. Venezuela, Claimant contends that the
latest possible cut-off date is October 7, 2014 when it filed its Request for Arbitration. '*!
Although the Secretary-General has the power under Article 36(3) of the ICSID
Convention to screen requests for arbitration before registration, Ansung argues it would
be “absurd to suggest that the cut-off date within the meaning of the China-Korea BIT
will change depending on the time taken by the ICSID Secretary-General to register the
Request for Arbitration,” especially as the Secretary-General’s screening power “does not

prejudice the tribunal’s power to examine its own competence.” !??

3) Conclusion

In sum, Claimant submits that, taking the facts it alleges as true, it meets the three-year
limitation period in Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT. Ansung “came to know, or
should have come to know, of its loss or damage around December 17, 2011” and it made
a claim with its Notice of Intent on May 19, 2014, approximately two-and-a-half years

later. 133

Alternatively, Claimant submits that it made a claim with the filing of its
Request for Arbitration on October 7, 2014,!*4 which also meets the three-year limitation
period in Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT. Consequently, Ansung’s claim cannot be

considered manifestly meritless on grounds that it is time-barred.

Tribunal’s Analysis

As the time limitation question before the Tribunal is one of treaty interpretation, the text

of Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT bears repeating:

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article, an
investor may not make a claim pursuant to paragraph 3 of this
Article if more than 3 years have elapsed from the date on which
the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, the
knowledge that the investor had incurred loss or damage.

It also bears repeating that, under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), China must establish

that Ansung’s claim is “manifestly without legal merit” on the basis of the facts as

pleaded by Ansung.

D

Dies a Quo

Turning first to the start date for the three-year limitation period in Article 9(7), the

record is clear that Claimant repeatedly pleaded facts setting the date at which it “first

acquired...the knowledge...that [it] had incurred loss or damage” to be before October

2011.

As set out in the Factual Background section above, which is based on the facts as

pleaded by Claimant:

a)

b)

Most important, in the Request for Arbitration (paragraph 12), Ansung pleaded
that it “was forced to dispose of its entire investment in Sheyang Xian in October

2011 in order to avoid further losses. Specifically, Ansung was forced to sell its

 

shareholdings in the Subsidiaries to a Chinese purchaser at a price significantly
lower than the amount that Ansung had invested toward the project” (emphasis
added). This indicates Ansung had knowledge that it had incurred loss or damage

before October 2011.

In the Request for Arbitration (paragraph 55), Ansung pleaded that its subsidiary
Mirage “was unable to meet the repayment date of June 20/1] for the [loan]
arranged by the Committee” (emphasis added), and “Ansung was unable to
produce sufficient returns from its investments in the [joint venture] and Mirage

as to justify their continued existence.” It was also in June 20]] that Ansung

32

108.

109.

c

d

employees suffered harassment from Committee officials and the local
government refused to provide police protection. This indicates Ansung had

knowledge of loss or damage incurred by June 2011.

In the Request for Arbitration (paragraph 60), Ansung pleaded that “in October
2011, Ansung had no alternative but to dispose of its entire assets of the golf
business, including its shareholding in the Subsidiaries, to a Chinese purchaser at
a price significantly lower than the amount that Ansung had invested toward the
project, causing serious financial losses and damage to Ansung” (emphasis
added). This indicates Ansung had knowledge of incurred loss or damage by

October 2011.

Ansung pleaded several other facts indicating knowledge of incurred damage, at
least to the prospects of its golf course project, well before October 2011. As
early as 2007, it observed the development of a competing golf course at Sheyang
Island Park, which went into operation in 2009.'35 In 2007 and 2008, Ansung
was compelled to pay a higher price for the additional 300 mu of land for phase
one than originally agreed, following what Ansung described as “the Committee’s

outright repudiation” of the Investment Agreement (emphasis added). '*°

After these multiple and clear pleadings, the Tribunal cannot accept Ansung’s attempts to
characterize these pre-October 2011 dates in its Observations and at the Rule 41(5)

Hearing as mere background information.

Nor can the Tribunal accept Ansung’s main argument that it incurred loss or damage for
Article 9(7) purposes “only after its expectation and plan for the 27-hole golf course was
completely frustrated, owing primarily to the government’s continued inaction in
providing the additional land for the second phase of the Project”!*” (emphasis added),

and when it sold its shares in the joint venture on December 17, 2011.

110. Ansung ignores the plain meaning of the words “first” and “loss or damage” in Article
9(7). The limitation period begins with an investor’s first knowledge of the fact that it
has incurred loss or damage, not with the date on which it gains knowledge of the
quantum of that loss or damage. Ansung’s actual sale of its shares on December 17, 2011
marked the date on which it could finalize or liquidate its damage, not the first date on

which it had to know it was incurring damage.

111. As aptly stated by the ICSID tribunal in the Interim Award in Spence v. Costa Rica, “the
limitation clause does not require full or precise knowledge of the loss or damage....such
knowledge is triggered by the first appreciation that loss or damage will be (or has been)
incurred. It neither requires nor permits a claimant to wait and see the full extent of the

loss or damage that will or may result.” 3°

112. The Tribunal acknowledges Claimant’s legal argument that a continuing omission by a
host State, such as alleged here, is recognized as a breach, for example in Pac Rim v. El
Salvador, and that damages for such a continuing breach may be measured from different
times after the first incident of that omission. As noted by the UPS tribunal, a
“continuing course of conduct might generate losses of a different dimension at different

times.”!°

113. However, even assuming a continuing omission breach attributable to China, which the
Tribunal must assume, and even assuming Ansung might wish to claim damages from a
date later than the first knowledge of China’s continuing omission — for example, from
November 2, 2011, when Ansung tentatively agreed to transfer its shares or even
December 17, 2011, when Ansung’s commercial patience ran out — that could not change
the date on which Ansung first knew it had incurred damage. And it is that first date that
starts the three-year limitation period in Article 9(7). To allow Claimant to adjust that
date of first knowledge by selecting the date from which it wants to claim damages for

continuing breach would be, to borrow from the Spence decision, to allow an “endless

114.

115.

116.

117.

118.

parsing up of a claim into ever finer sub-components of breach over time in an attempt to

come within the limitation period.” !°

To conclude, based on the facts as pleaded by Claimant, Ansung “first acquired, or
should have first acquired, the knowledge that [it] had incurred loss or damage” in
connection with its ill-fated golf course project in Sheyang-Xian for purposes of Article
9(7) of the Treaty on a date before October 2011. The record does not provide an exact
date, but it is reasonable to assume a date close to October, in late summer or early

autumn 2011.

2) Dies ad Quem

Turning to the dies ad quem for the applicable three-year limitation period, the Tribunal
finds that, on the basis of the plain language in Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT, the

end date is the date on which an investor deposits its request for arbitration with ICSID.

The interpretive steps are not difficult. Article 9(7) instructs that an investor “may not
make a claim pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article” more than three years after the dies
a quo. Paragraph 3 of Article 9, in turn, instructs that “the dispute shall be submitted, at
the option of the investor, to [as relevant here] ICSID.” In coming to this conclusion, the
Tribunal finds itself in agreement with the Decision on Jurisdiction in Vannessa Ventures
v. Venezuela, where the ICSID tribunal had to determine when a dispute was submitted
and found that the “relevant document regarding the interruption of the statute of

limitation is therefore the Request for Arbitration.” !4!

In the Tribunal’s view, this combination of paragraphs 3 and 7 of Article 9 of the China-
Korea BIT excludes the two alternative end dates championed by the Parties in their

primary cases.

First, Claimant correctly points out that Article 9(5) of the Treaty requires an investor to

take the preliminary step of giving the Contracting Party a written notice of intent.

49 Spence, para. 208.

41 Vannessa Ventures, p. 31.

35

119.

120.

121.

122.

Vill.

123.

However, as a matter of plain text, the Article 9(5) notice of intent is not “submitted. ..to

ICSID,” as required by Article 9(3).

Second, for similar reasons, the date on which ICSID registers the request for arbitration
is, by definition, subsequent to the date the dispute is “submitted...to ICSID.” Moreover,
the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that it would be unreasonable to subscribe to the
Contracting Parties the intention that the end date of the Article 9(7) limitation period
would be dependent upon the uncertain date of registration of a request for arbitration,
which may depend upon a number of extraneous factors (no matter how efficient ICSID’s

registration process has become).

In light of the Tribunal’s interpretation, it is not necessary to address the Parties’
arguments concerning interpretation of the potentially different meaning of the words

“dispute” and “claim” in the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

Claimant deposited the Request for Arbitration with ICSID electronically on October 7,
2014 and physically on October 8, 2014. Either date is more than three years after late

summer or early autumn 2011, or the beginning of October 2011.

Consequently, Ansung submitted its dispute to ICSID and made its claim for purposes of
Article 9(3) and (7) of the Treaty after more than three years had elapsed from the date on
which Ansung first acquired knowledge of loss or damage. The claim is time-barred and,

as such, is manifestly without legal merit.

ARTICLE 3 OF THE CHINA-KOREA BIT - MFN TREATMENT

To recall, Article 3 of the China-Korea BIT provides:

3. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investors
of the other Contracting Party and to their investments and
activities associated with such investments by the investors of the
other Contracting Party treatment no less favourable than that
accorded in like circumstances to the investors and investments
and associated activities by the investors of any third State
(hereinafter referred to as “most-favoured-nation treatment”) with
respect to investments and business activities [defined in paragraph

36

124.

125.

126.

142
13.)

4)
145

1 as “the expansion, operation, management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment, and sale or other disposal of investments”], including
the admission of investment.

5. Treatment accorded to investors of one Contracting Party within
the territory of the other Contracting Party with respect to access to
the courts of justice and administrative tribunals and authorities
both in pursuit and in defence of their rights shall not be less
favourable than that accorded to investors of the latter Contracting
Party or to investors of any third State.

Claimant’s Position

Should the Tribunal find that Ansung made its claim after the three-year limitation
period, Claimant argues in the alternative, in its First and Second Observations, that the
MEN Clause in Article 3(3) of the China-Korea BIT operates to save the claim from

being time-barred. '4?

First, after noting that MFN clauses operate to allow investors to import substantive
rights from other treaties, Ansung argues that the principle of extinctive prescription is
considered a substantive (rather than a procedural) right both in international law and in
many civil law countries, including Korea and China.'4? Claimant then relies on a two-
page table of 81 Chinese BITs to contend that most Chinese BITs do not have any
prescription period.'*# Because the three-year limitation period in Article 9(7) of the
China-Korea BIT “is less favorable to foreign investors than those investors protected by
BITs which do not contain such a prescription period,” Ansung claims the protection of

other Chinese treaties lacking prescription periods. !4°

Second, even if the three-year period in Article 9(7) is considered to be procedural rather
than substantive, Ansung contends that “[m]Jany tribunals and commentators are of the

view that MFN clauses should be interpreted broadly” and be extended to the important

procedural protection of arbitration provisions.'4° In its First Observations, Ansung

refers to a “stream of jurisprudence”!4”

supporting its MFN argument, to be developed at
a later stage of the proceedings, which allegedly shows that China’s Rule 41(5) Objection
does not meet the requisite legal threshold.'** In its Second Observations, Ansung
reiterates that such jurisprudence “will insulate” its claims from China’s jurisdictional

defense, by supporting its use of Chinese treaties without limitations periods. '4°

Third, contesting China’s treaty interpretation position, Ansung argues that the terms
“treatment” and “investment activities” in Article 3(3) of the Treaty should be broadly
interpreted to include dispute settlement procedures, because investor-State arbitration is
critical to protect investment activities.'°° Moreover, Claimant submits that the

geographical limitation “within the territory” found in the MFN Clause of the Treaty does

1

not prevent application of the MFN Clause to the dispute settlement clause.'*! Ansung

puts forward case law to support its arguments. '>*

Ansung refers to Siemens v.
Argentina, where the tribunal interpreted the phrase “activities related to investment,”
included in an MFN clause, to be sufficiently wide to include settlement of disputes.
Such an interpretation allowed the claimant in Siemens to access another treaty that did

not condition international arbitration on waiting 18 months after initiation of the

3

domestic judicial process.'°* Furthermore, Ansung relies on AWG v. Argentina, where

the tribunal interpreted an MFN clause similar to Article 3(3) of the China-Korea BIT —
covering an investor’s “management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their
investments” — to apply to dispute settlement and allow the claimant to avoid having to

submit its dispute first to local courts. '**

Ansung contests China’s contextual argument that Article 3(5) of the Treaty, which
provides MEN treatment with respect to “access to courts of justice and administrative
tribunals and authorities”, demonstrates that Article 3(3) is unrelated to dispute
settlement. Ansung argues that Article 3(5) on its face “comprehensively covers all kinds
of domestic judicial or administrative proceedings” and therefore not international
dispute settlement.'*> Ansung further suggests that China’s argument regarding
references to its treaty practice fails, because, among other things, the treaties submitted

by China are later than the China-Korea BIT, which “makes the Respondent’s

 

analysis...less convincing”, and also refers to general treaty practice on MEN clauses.!*°

In its Second Observations, Ansung emphasizes the importance of the alleged substantive
nature of the prescription period, as tribunals are more likely to import substantive
standards than procedural protections from third party treaties through the MFN

clause. !°7

Respondent’s Position

In its Observations responding to Claimant’s First Observations, Respondent contests
Ansung’s reliance on the MFN Clause in Article 3(3) of the China-Korea BIT to save its
claim from being dismissed as time-barred under Article 9(7). China emphasizes that
Article 3(3) does not apply either in general to investor-State dispute settlement
provisions or in particular to China’s temporal condition to consent to arbitration in

Article 9(7).!58

First, China argues that Ansung’s invocation of the MFN Clause in Article 3(3) fails as a
matter of treaty interpretation.'* The text of Article 3(3) limits MFN treatment to the
host State’s territory and covers only “investment and business activities,” which phrase

is defined in Article 3(1) to cover “the expansion, operation, management, maintenance,

use, enjoyment, and sale or other disposal of investments” — and does not include dispute
settlement.'© The Treaty context confirms that Article 3(3) does not cover dispute
settlement. This is because Article 3(5) separately provides for MFN treatment for
dispute resolution by access to courts and administrative tribunals, demonstrating that the

Contracting States do not consider Article 3(3) to apply to dispute settlement.'*!

132. Respondent asserts that the Contracting States’ treaty practice further confirms that
Article 3(3) does not apply to dispute settlement. The 2012 trilateral agreement on
investment between China, Korea and Japan similarly limits MFN treatment to
“investment activities” encompassing “management, conduct, operation, maintenance,
use, enjoyment and sale or other disposition of investments,” and the States expressly
state their understanding that this MFN treatment does not extend to dispute
settlement.'®? The 2015 comprehensive free trade agreement between China and Korea

is to similar effect.'°

133. Second, Respondent argues that Claimant erred in equating Article 9(7) of the Treaty
with the principle of extinctive prescription under international law. Article 9(7)
explicitly conditions a Contracting State’s consent to arbitration under Article 9(3) “on
the submission of a claim within a precisely delimited and unqualified time period,”
which, under the plain Treaty terms, is “both an integral part of the investor-State
dispute-resolution mechanism and a condition to China’s consent to arbitration.”!* In
comparison, extinctive (or equitable) prescription arises under customary international
law and “represents a form of the common-law notion of laches,” requiring an assessment

of State negligence without a fixed time period. Article 9(7), says China, is “akin to a

137.

statute of limitation that fixes an unyielding, specific time limitation for bringing a claim

and specifies the beginning and end date for the calculation.”!®

Third, China contends that Ansung errs in categorizing either equitable prescription or
Article 9(7) as a substantive obligation. While in customary international law
prescription is a question of admissibility rather than merits, “Article 9(7) is explicitly
framed as a condition to consent to arbitration and therefore presents a question of
jurisdiction.” !°

Finally, Respondent emphasizes that Claimant has failed to specify a treaty with more
favorable treatment as a matter of time limitation, and so has failed to demonstrate more

favorable treatment than Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT.!°7

Tribunal’s Analysis

Ansung’s alternative defense to China’s Rule 41(5) Objection is that, because China has
entered into other bilateral investment treaties with third States that do not prescribe a
temporal limitation for an investor initiating an arbitration claim against the host State,
Ansung is entitled to invoke the MFN Clause in Article 3(3) of the China-Korea BIT to

disregard the three-year limitation period in Article 9(7) of the Treaty.

The Tribunal accepts that the ambit of an MEN clause is dependent on its wording.

Article 3(3) of the China-Korea BIT relevantly provides:

other disposal of investments”], including the admission of

investments.
A plain reading of this Article does not extend to MEN treatment for a State’s consent to
arbitrate with investors and, in particular, not to the temporal limitation period for
investor-State arbitration in Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT. The Tribunal considers
that Article 9(7) pertains to the Contracting State’s consent to arbitration, and so it is
irrelevant whether under municipal law prescription is a matter of substance or
procedure. The import of Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT is a matter of international
law, as correctly pointed out by Respondent and as is reflected in the International Law

Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility.'*

The Tribunal’s conclusion in relation to the MFN Clause in Article 3(3) of the China-
Korea BIT also becomes clear by reference to Article 3(5) of the Treaty. This Article
offers specific MFN protection in relation to an investor’s “access to courts of justice and
administrative tribunals and authorities.” In marked contrast to those domestic avenues,
such express reference to international dispute resolution is conspicuously absent in the

MEN Clause in Article 3(3).

As the Tribunal finds that the wording of the MFN Clause in Article 3(3) of the Treaty is
clear, it is not necessary to give further consideration to additional arguments or previous
arbitral decisions on the interpretation of other MFN clauses or treaty practice. The plain
reading of Article 3(3) and its interpretation leave no doubt that China has established its
Rule 41(5) Objection with regard to the MFN Clause “clearly and obviously, with

relative ease and despatch,” contrary to Claimant’s allegation.

For these reasons the Tribunal does not consider that Article 3(3) of the China-Korea BIT
assists Claimant in preventing its claim from being manifestly time-barred under Article

9(7) of the Treaty.

To conclude, the Tribunal has carefully considered Respondent’s Rule 41(5) Objection,
the Observations from both Parties, and the presentations from counsel at the Rule 41(5)
Hearing. The breadth and depth of the Parties’ submissions has enabled the Tribunal to
provide its oral ruling after deliberating at the end of the First Session and Rule 41(5)
Hearing. In specific, to borrow language from the Trans-Global tribunal, the Tribunal
was able to determine that China established its Rule 41(5) Objection “clearly and
obviously, with relative ease and despatch” and its determination proved not to be

“difficult.”

Accepting the facts as pleaded by Claimant to be true, the Tribunal finds Ansung’s claim
to be time-barred under Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT and not protected by
operation of the MFN Clause in Article 3(3) of the Treaty. The Tribunal finds the claim

hence to be manifestly without legal merit under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5).

In light of the reasoning above, Respondent’s alternative request that the Tribunal hear
the question of the application of Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT as a preliminary

question pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(4) is moot.

COSTS

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how
and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the
members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the
facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part
of the award.

This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration,

including attorney’s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.

169 Cl. Statement of Costs

Claimant’s Position

In its Statement of Costs of January 17, 2017, Claimant seeks the following costs: (i)
costs of ICSID arbitration, including the lodging fee, amounting to US$ 175,000; (ii) wire
transfer fee for the lodging fee, amounting to KRW 54,340; and (iii) professional fees and

disbursements of Bae, Kim & Lee LLC, amounting to KRW 433,772,145.'°

In support of its costs request, Claimant asserts that, “although there is no set principle
for allocation of costs in ICSID arbitrations, the Tribunal in one well-cited award [Romak
v. Uzbekistan] was compelled to conclude after reviewing prior jurisprudence that there is
a ‘general practice in investment treaty arbitration disfavoring the shifting of arbitration
costs against the losing party’ and that ‘a general trend has developed that arbitration
costs should be equally apportioned between the Parties, irrespective of the outcome of

the dispute.’”!7°

Claimant asks the Tribunal to follow this “general trend” and exercise its discretion under
Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention to order each Party to bear its own costs and
divide the ICSID costs (including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal) equally. Ansung
offers three reasons for this allocation, in the circumstances of this case: first, Ansung,
which is a small investor, has suffered substantial loss as a consequence of China’s
actions, and “pursued the instant claim in good faith and on sound substantive ground;”
second, Ansung presented its case “in the most procedurally efficient and economical
manner;” and, third, the Rule 41(5) Objection issues were novel issues of law.'7! As to
the third reason, Claimant emphasizes that “the Tribunal was called on to rule on the
novel legal questions of (i) whether MEN applies to limitations provisions in a BIT, and
(ii) how to interpret ‘knowledge that the investor had incurred loss or damage’ under

Article 9(7) of the BIT.”!2

In Claimant’s Response, Ansung reiterates the novelty of these legal arguments and
emphasizes that “the applicability of a MFN clause to limitation periods has never been

tested by an investment treaty tribunal previously.”!”*

Ansung rejects China’s argument that the upholding of a Rule 41(5) objection
automatically requires an ICSID tribunal to award all costs to the respondent. In support,
Ansung cites Global Trading Resource v. Ukraine, in which the tribunal “gave much
weight to the parties’ conduct in apportioning costs and did not give any consideration to

the review threshold under Rule 41(5).”!4

Claimant also challenges the level of Respondent’s legal costs, which are almost double
Ansung’s costs. This disparity is unreasonable, Ansung contends, because China filed
only two briefs totaling 47 pages, participated in a one-day hearing, and did not have to
prepare a comprehensive submission equivalent to Claimant’s Request for Arbitration.!7>
Ansung objects to Respondent’s “attempts [at] justifying its excessive costs by arguing
that it needed to prepare a defense to Ansung’s allegedly shifting arguments and

conflicting factual assertions.”!7°

Ansung points out that China did not raise this
“shifting arguments” contention until November 2016, while most of its legal costs were
incurred before September 2016 and one-third of the sums claimed by the Zhong Lun law

firm had been paid by July 2015.!7”

Finally, Ansung requests the Tribunal to disregard China’s “unsolicited” and “fresh”
request for post-Award interest. Ansung alleges that this request falls outside the scope
of the Statements of Costs and outside the Tribunal’s instructions allowing Respondent to

file observations on Claimant’s Statement of Costs, which did not address interest. !78

Respondent’s Position

In its Statement of Costs of January 17, 2017, Respondent seeks the following costs: (i)
costs of ICSID arbitration, amounting to US$ 149,985.00; (ii) disbursements relating to
Chinese Government representatives’ attendance at the Rule 41(5) Hearing in Singapore,
amounting to US$ 6,471; (iii) Dentons’ invoiced legal fees and disbursements, amounting
to EUR 356,590.80; and (iv) Zhong Lun’s invoiced total legal fees, amounting to CNY
3,330,900.33 with fees capped at CNY 1,850,000.00 (including disbursements of CNY
200,000).!7?

In Respondent’s Observations on Costs, China contests Ansung’s depiction of the general
approach to allocation of costs being “pay-your-own-way,” citing the words of the ICSID
tribunal in Arif v. Moldova that “a ‘more modern strand is for the costs to be awarded on
the basis of the relative success of the parties in the arbitration.””!®° Ansung argues that
the “costs follow the event” principle is “particularly adapted to cases where the losing

party’s arguments are rejected for fundamental lack of merit”!*!

and “particularly suited
to the context of a successful Rule 41(5) objection.”'** China relies on the RSM v.
Grenada award, in which the tribunal “had no difficulty applying the ‘costs follow the
event’ principle and ordered the unsuccessful claimant to bear the entirety of the
arbitration costs in a case where the claims were rejected for manifest lack of legal merit

following a successful Rule 41(5) objection.” '**

Respondent objects to Claimant’s arguments in favor of cost-sharing. First, even if
Ansung is a small investor and made a good faith mistake in assessing its case, there is no
basis for the Tribunal to presume that Ansung’s substantive claims would have proven

meritorious.'*+ Second, Claimant “cannot claim being efficient” by bringing a claim that

was dismissed for a manifest lack of legal merit.'®° Third, the issues presented were not
novel, as “[n]umerous investor-State tribunals have rejected claimants’ claims on the
basis of similar temporal objections to the application of a treaty” and China’s objections
were based “on the clear wording of Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT which the

Tribunal had no difficulty applying in this case.” !*°

Finally, China emphasizes that its costs were “reasonable and proportionate to the total
amount of work that was needed to prepare a defense against Ansung’s shifting
arguments and conflicting factual assertions.”'*’ Further, Respondent achieved an early
dismissal of the case “through an expedited procedure introduced specifically to address

frivolous claims filed against the ICSID Contracting States.” !**

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal’s decision in favor of Respondent’s Rule 41(5) Objection constitutes a
decision as contemplated by Arbitration Rule 41(6) regarding a lack of jurisdiction of the
Centre and of its own competence as well as regarding manifest lack of legal merit due to

a lack of temporal jurisdiction.

The Tribunal need not venture into the discussion about whether there is a general trend
in ICSID practice favoring the “costs follow the event” approach or “pay-your-own-way”
approach to allocation of costs. The Tribunal is satisfied that, under the circumstances in
this case, Respondent is entitled to its reasonable costs. The Tribunal’s determination
that Ansung’s claim manifestly lacks legal merit as time-barred necessarily means that
the claim should not have been brought, and China should not bear the reasonable costs

for successfully defending the claim at the Rule 41(5) stage.

Even accepting the novelty of Ansung’s arguments concerning the applicability of MFN

treatment to limitations provisions in BITs in general and the proper interpretation of

161.

162.

163.

Article 9(7) of the China-Korea BIT (“knowledge that the investor had incurred loss or

damage”), novelty is not necessarily a test of even prima facie validity.

Even further accepting that Ansung is a small investor in an unfortunate position,
proceeding in good faith against China, these points are irrelevant to the allocation of
costs following acceptance of the Rule 41(5) Objection. Nor is efficiency in an
Arbitration Rule 41(5) objection procedure necessarily a factor relevant to costs
allocation, as an Arbitration Rule 41(5) objection procedure is by definition designed to

promote efficiency.

This is not to say that costs could and should never be apportioned between the parties
following a successful Rule 41(5) objection. In this regard, the Tribunal notes Claimant’s
reliance on Global Trading Resource v. Ukraine, in which the tribunal granted Ukraine’s
Rule 41(5) objection but chose not to allocate costs between the parties. However, as
pointed out by Claimant itself, the Award dates to 2010, and the tribunal opined that
“given the newness of the Rule 41(5) procedure and given the reasonable nature of the
arguments concisely presented to it by both parties, the appropriate outcome is for the
costs of the procedure to lie where they fall.”'*? In comparison, the Rule 41(5) procedure
is no longer new and the Tribunal has found in this case that Claimant’s limitations

arguments were not reasonable.

This leaves the question of the reasonableness of the amount of costs claimed by
Respondent. Having considered the circumstances and the entire record carefully, the
Tribunal determines to apportion only 75 percent of Respondent’s costs to Claimant.
This is not because China claimed substantially higher costs than Ansung claimed, as
percentage comparisons ignore issues such as market rates and individual fee
arrangements. Rather, the Tribunal considers that the legal costs sought by China, even
noting the fee cap for the Zhong Lun law firm, are disproportionate to the extent of the

Rule 41(5) Objection submissions and one-day hearing.

'89 Global Trading, para. 59.

164. Turning to post-Award interest, Ansung is incorrect in suggesting that China made a
“fresh” request for post-Award interest in its Observations on Claimant’s Submissions on
Costs. The record reflects that China requested post-Award interest, at a commercially
reasonable rate to be set by the Tribunal, in its Rule 41(5) Objection, in its Observations
and in its Statement of Costs.'° The Tribunal determines to award post-Award interest,

on the terms set out below.

165. To conclude, the Tribunal decides to assess all of the direct costs of the proceeding and

75 percent of Respondent’s legal fees and expenses against Claimant.

166. The direct costs of the proceeding include: (i) the fees and expenses of each Member of
the Tribunal; (ii) payments made by ICSID for other direct expenses, such as those
related to the conduct of hearings (e.g., court reporting, Maxwell Chambers’ charges,
courier services, and estimated charges related to the dispatch of this Award); and (iii)

ICSID’s administrative fees.

167. These costs amount to (in US$):

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses:

Professor Lucy Reed US$ 29,987.20
Dr. Michael Pryles US$ 29,444.84
Professor Albert Jan van den Berg US$ 33,589.05
Other direct expenses (estimated) US$ 14,500.00
ICSID’s administrative fees US$ 32,000.00
Total US$ 139,521.09

168. The above costs have been paid out of the advances made to ICSID by the Parties in
equal parts. Once the case account balance is final, the ICSID Secretariat will provide
the Parties with a detailed financial statement, and the remaining balance will be

reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the advances they made.

169.

Accordingly, the Tribunal orders Claimant to pay Respondent US$ 69,760.55 for the
expended portion of Respondent’s advances to ICSID and US$ 4853.25 plus
EUR 267,443.10 plus CNY 1,387,500 to cover 75 percent of Respondent’s legal fees and
expenses, plus interest at the rate of three-month LIBOR plus two percent, compounded
quarterly, such interest to run from the 90" day after the date of dispatch of this Award

on any unpaid portion of the amounts due under this Award until the date of payment.

DECISION
For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

(1) Dismisses with prejudice all claims made by Claimant, Ansung Housing Co., Ltd., in

its Request for Arbitration, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5).

(2) Awards Respondent, the People’s Republic of China, its share of the direct costs of
the proceeding in the amount of US$ 69,760.55, plus 75 percent of its legal fees and
expenses in the amount of US$ 4853.25 plus EUR 267,443.10 plus CNY 1,387,500,
plus interest at the rate of three-month LIBOR plus two percent, compounded
quarterly, such interest to run from the 90" day after the date of dispatch of this
Award on any unpaid portion of the amounts due under this Award until the date of

payment.
