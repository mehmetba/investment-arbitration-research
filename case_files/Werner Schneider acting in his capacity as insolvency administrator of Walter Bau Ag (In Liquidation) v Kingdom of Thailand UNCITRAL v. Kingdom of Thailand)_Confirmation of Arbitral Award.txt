10 Civ. 2729 (DAB)
CONFRIMATION OF
ARBITRAL AWARD

DEBORAH A. BATTS, United States District Judge.

Petitioner, Werner Schneider, acting as insolvency

administrator of Walter Bau Ag (“WB” or “Petitioner”), petitions

this Court to confirm an arbitration award of approximately

$40,000,000.00 against Respondent, The Kingdom of Thailand

(“Thailand” or “Respondent”). In 1988, Thailand granted a

concession to a consortium to construct and operate a tollway

outside of Bangkok, Thailand. WB was an investor in that

consortium and asserts Thailand deprived WB of the benefit of

its investment. Thailand has filed a Cross-Petition to dismiss

the Petition. Thailand argues that the Court should dismiss the

Petition on forum non conveniens grounds or, if the Court

considers the Petition, the Court should dismiss the Petition

because the arbitrators did not have jurisdiction. For the

reasons below, the Court GRANTS WB’s Petition to confirm the

1

 

 

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 _ Filed 03/14/11 Page 2 of 25

July 1, 2009 arbitration award in favor of WB and against

Thailand and DENIES Thailand’s Cross-Petition.

I. BACKGROUND*
A. Agreement to Develop and Operate the Tollway Project

During the 1980s, Thailand sought to develop its public
infrastructure. One such project was the engineering,
construction and operation of a 26-kilometer tollway extending
from central Bangkok to (what was at the relevant time)
Bangkok’s international airport at Don Muang (the “Tollway
Project”). (Jurisdiction Award (“Juris. Award”) § 1.49, Wenger
Decl. Ex. 1.) Thailand decided not to commit public funds to
the Tollway Project. Instead, the Thai Department of Highways,
a department of the Thai government, invited parties to tender

for a tollway concession.

On August 21, 1989, the Thai Department of Highways entered
into a Concession Agreement (“Concession”) with Don Muang
Tollway Co. (“DMT”), a Thai company, for the Tollway Project.

Both the Thai Council of Ministers (the “Cabinet”) and the

+ The Parties generally agree to the factual history in this

arbitration petition. To the extent Respondent asserts that
factual disputes remain, the Court will assume Respondent’s
factual aversions are true.

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 _ Filed 03/14/11 Page 3 of 25

Supreme-Attorney General approved the Concession. Dyckerhoff &
Widhamm AG (“D&W”), a German company, invested in DMT and
following a restructuring of DMT, D&W owned just under 10
percent of DMT’s shares. (Juris. Award § 1.52, Wenger Decl. Ex.
1.) On August 16, 2001, D&W was merged into WB. Through the
merger, WB acquired all of D&W’s assets, including its shares in

DMT. (Id. § 1.53.)

DMT built the highway over a period of five years. A
number of events occurred during this time. On June 11, 1990,
the Cabinet approved the Tollway Project as being eligible for
investment promotion privileges such as tax benefits, which were
granted. On May 16, 1991, an inter-ministerial committee of the
Thai government, the Board of Investment (the “BOI”), issued a
certificate of investment to DMT for the Tollway Project. This
certificate was issued under Thailand’s Investment Promotion
Act. On June 11, 1996, the Cabinet approved, in principle, an
amendment to the Concession. On November 29, 1996, the
Department of Highways granted an amendment to the Concession
which extended the highway in the Tollway Project a further six
kilometers. On March 6, 1998, the BOI issued a second
certificate of investment to DMT for the construction and
operation of a northern extension. The Don Muang Tollway opened

on December 14, 1994, and has been open for traffic without

3

 

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 _ Filed 03/14/11 Page 4 of 25

interruption ever since. There has been no issue over the

Tollway Project’s condition or operation.

B. WB’s Involvement in the Tollway Project

WB was a significant part of the consortium that made up
DMT. WB was the principal promoter of the Tollway Project. WB
undertook much of the engineering work. WB selected, instructed
and supervised the financial advisors who put together the debt

and equity finance.

Between August 1989 and July 1997, WB invested about 750
million Thai baht (approximately $24.4 million in today’s value’)
in the Tollway Project. Based on the investors’ original
expectations, WB should have received its first dividend from
DMT in 1997. At the time of the underlying arbitration hearing,
its investment would have been worth approximately $129 million.
However, in 2007, after multiple attempts to resolve its

disagreements with Thailand, WB sold its shares in DMT.

WB asserts, and the arbitrators found, that WB’s investment
was, in essence, thwarted by the wrongful acts and omissions of

Thailand. These included Thailand's blocking of DMT’s ability

3 As stated in Petitioner’s September 24, 2010 brief.

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 _ Filed 03/14/11 Page 5 of 25

to charge the agreed-upon tolls, carrying out continuous
programs of improvement of roads competing with the Don Muang
Tollway, causing tolls to be decreased, and closing the Don
Muang airport. Thailand denies wrongdoing and asserts that it
was an economic downturn in Thailand that negatively affected

the Tollway Project.

C. The Relevant Treaties

Thailand and Germany have entered into two treaties that
are at issue in this case. The first treaty is the December 13,
1961 Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the
Kingdom of Thailand concerning the Promotion and Reciprocal
Protection of Investments (the “1961 Treaty”). (Wenger Decl. Ex.
2.) The second treaty is the June 24, 2002 Treaty between the
Kingdom of Thailand and the Federal Republic of Germany for the
Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, which
entered into force on October 20, 2004 (the “2002 Treaty”).
(Wenger Decl. Ex. 3.) The 1961 Treaty does not provide
investors with a right to arbitrate disputes against Thailand,
while the 2002 Treaty grants investors the right to arbitrate

investment-related disputes with Thailand as long as their

 

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 Filed 03/14/11 Page 6 of 25

investments receive official approval from Thailand. (1961

Treaty, Article 11; 2002 Treaty, Articles 2(2), 10.)

The Parties agree on several aspects of the requirements
for the approval of investments under the 1961 Treaty and the
2002 Treaty, including: (1) For pre-2002 Treaty investments such
as WB’s investment, Article 8 of the 2002 Treaty only protects
“approved investments” (Thailand’s Post-Hearing Submission § 15,
Wenger Decl. Ex. 4.); (2) An investment approved under the 1961
Treaty was an “approved investment” under Article 8 of the 2002
Treaty (Thailand’s Post-Hearing Submission § 4, Wenger Decl. Ex.
4.); and (3) In the 1961 Treaty, the Protocol to Article 1 (the
“Protocol”) sets forth the requirements for approval, and hence
the requirements for protection under the 2002 Treaty
(Thailand’s Post-Hearing Submission § 16, Wenger Decl. Ex. 4;

WB’s Post-Hearing Submission §§ 10.2-10.7, Wenger Decl. Ex. 5.).

D. Procedural History of the Arbitration

On September 21, 2005, WB submitted a Request for
Arbitration against Thailand (“Request”). (Juris. Award § 1.2,
Wenger Decl. Ex. 1.) WB alleged that Thailand breached its

obligations to WB under the 2002 Treaty by not properly fixing

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 _ Filed 03/14/11 Page 7 of 25

or increasing the levels of tolls for the highway built by DMT,

depriving WB of its return on its investment. (Id. § 1.59.)

The Parties agreed on a panel of three arbitrators (the
(“Arbitrators”). On October 6, 2006, Thailand submitted a
Memorial on Jurisdiction (“Thailand’s Juris. Memorial”)
objecting to the Arbitrators’ jurisdiction over WB’s claims.
Thailand asked the Arbitrators to bifurcate the proceedings and
determine whether they had jurisdiction before hearing the

merits of the case. (Juris. Award § 1.27, Wenger Decl. Ex. 1.)

On December 8, 2006, WB replied to Thailand’s jurisdiction
objection. The Arbitrators granted Thailand’s request for
bifurcation and agreed to consider issues of jurisdiction at the
outset. (Juris. Award § 1.28, Wenger Decl. Ex. 1.) The parties
submitted multiple filings and participated in a hearing on

Thailand’s objections to the Arbitrators’ jurisdiction.

The Parties’ dispute before the Arbitrators centered on the
approval requirements of the Protocol to Article 1 of the 1961
Treaty and whether the approvals received by WB qualified under
that Article. WB argued, inter alia, that it had met the
requirements under the 1961 and 2002 Treaties. Thailand argued,
inter alia, that for WB’s investment to have been approved under

the 1961 Treaty and be entitled to protection under the 2002

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 _ Filed 03/14/11 Page 8 of 25

Treaty, the Protocol required WB to obtain a Certificate of
Admission (also referred to as a Certificate of Approval) (“CA”)
classifying its investment as an “approved project.” WB never
obtained a CA. (Thailand’s Post-Hearing Submission §§ 25, 29,

Wenger Decl. Ex. 4.)

On October 5, 2007, the Arbitrators concluded that WB was a
protected investor under Article 8 of the 2002 Treaty because WB
had made an “approved investment” under the 1961 Treaty, and
therefore, the Parties’ dispute should be arbitrated. (Juris.
Award § 5.13, Wenger Decl. Ex. 1.) The Arbitrators denied

Thailand’s objections to their jurisdiction over WB’s claims.

On July 1, 2009, the Arbitrators issued the final Award,
assessing damages against Thailand in the amount of 29.21
million euros, plus costs in the amount of 1,806,560 euros, plus
interest (“the Award”). On March 26, 2010, WB filed its Petition
seeking confirmation of the Award. Thailand filed its Cross-

Petition to dismiss WB’s Petition on August 17, 2010.

II. DISCUSSION

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 _ Filed 03/14/11 Page 9 of 25

A. Applicable Law Under the FAA

Foreign arbitral awards are recognized and enforced under
the Federal Arbitration Act (the “Act”), which codified the New
York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign
Arbitral Awards (the “New York Convention”). 9 USC § 201. The
United States has strictly adhered to, and enforced, arbitration
awards made under the New York Convention. Scherk v. Alberto-
Culver Co., 417 U.S. 506, 520 (1974). The Act permits any party
to an arbitration to apply to any court having jurisdiction for
an order confirming the award within three years after an award

is made. Petitioner WB makes such an application.

Arbitration awards are subject to "very limited review" in
order to ensure that "the twin goals of arbitration, namely,
settling disputes efficiently and avoiding long and expensive

litigation" are met. Folkways Music Publishers, Inc. v. Weiss,

 

989 F.2d 108, 111 (2d Cir. 1993). Accordingly, "[t]he showing
required to avoid summary confirmation of an arbitration award
is high, and a party moving to vacate the award has the burden
of proof." Willemijn Houdstermaatschappij, BV v. Standard
Microsystems Corp., 103 F.3d 9, 12 (2d Cir. 1997) (citations
omitted). The Act instructs that a court “shall” confirm the
award unless it finds a ground for refusal or deferral of

recognition or enforcement specified in the Convention. 9 USC §
9

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 _ Filed 03/14/11 Page 10 of 25

207. The burden of proof is on the party opposing the
recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award. Parsons &
Whittemore Overseas Co. v. Societe Generale de L'Industrie du

Papier (RAKTA), 508 F.2d 969, 973 (2d Cir. 1974).

Thailand presents two main arguments as to why the Petition
in this case should be dismissed: (1) the Arbitrators improperly
asserted jurisdiction as the Parties did not agree to arbitrate;
and (2) forum non conveniens grounds based primarily on the fact

that Thailand has no assets in the United States.

B,. The Court’s Review of the Arbitrators’ Award

Thailand argues that the Court should take a “fresh look”
at whether Thailand and WB agreed to arbitrate the dispute that
resulted in the arbitration Award. In support of its argument,
Thailand cites First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514
U.S. 938 (1995). In First Options, the Supreme Court held that
whether someone is bound by an arbitration agreement is a
question of arbitrability that should be decided by the courts,
absent clear and unmistakable evidence of an agreement between
the parties to submit the question to arbitration. Id. at 943-

45. The Court held that a general and broad arbitration clause

10

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 Filed 03/14/11 Page 11 of 25

was not enough to satisfy the clear and unmistakable evidence
requirement. Id.

The Second Circuit has declined to read First Options so
expansively as to extend it to all questions of arbitrability.
Abram Landau Real Estate v. Bevona, 123 F.3d 69, 72 (2d Cir.
1997).* As the Second Circuit has stated, problems of
arbitrability arise in two contexts: (1) when parties disagree
whether an arbitration clause covers a particular dispute; and
(2), when the parties disagree not about the scope of the
arbitration clause but about “whether there is even a valid
agreement to arbitrate in effect at a particular time.” Acequip
Ltd. v. American Eng’g Corp., 315 F.3d 151, 155-56 (2d Cir.
2003) (citing Abram Landau Real Estate v. Bevona, 123 F.3d 69, 72
(2d Cir. 1997)); see also Consol. Rail Corp. v. Metro. Trans.
Auth., 1996 WL 137587, at *5 (S.D.N.¥. Mar. 22, 1996)
(confirming arbitration award after finding that "arbitrability
falls into three distinct categories.").

First Options only considered the case where a party
resists arbitration or seeks to vacate an arbitral award "on the
grounds that he or she was never party to an agreement to

arbitrate." Consol. Rail Corp., 1996 WL 137587, at *5. In that

‘ While Abram Landau Real Estate is in the employment

context, it is instructive on the application of First Options.

11

 

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 Filed 03/14/11 Page 12 of 25

type of situation, the party arguing against arbitration is
entitled to have a court review whether they agreed to arbitrate
disputes at all. First Options, 514 U.S. at 944-45. This case
is inapposite as the dispute here involves a valid arbitration
agreement that “gave at least some thought to the scope of
arbitration.” Id. at 943 (emphasis added) .°

Thailand has conceded, as it must, that it entered into the
two Treaties that expressly provide for the arbitration of
disputes between Thailand and German investors. Thus, this case
does not concern a question of agreement formation. Instead,
“the issue at hand is a construction of the language of the
agreement itself.” DaPuzzo v. Globalvest Mgmt. Co. L.P., 263
F.Suppl. 2d 714, 719 (S.D.N.Y¥. 2003). Specifically, Thailand
and WB dispute what kind of actions an investor must undertake
in order for his investment to fall within the scope of the 2002
treaty arbitration provision. This is clearly the first type of

arbitrability - one of scope. "As to scope, the standard to

8 Thailand cites to a UK Supreme Court case Dallah v.
Pakistan in support of its argument. [2010] UKSC 46 UK. Dallah
cites to First Options in the UK Supreme Court’s analysis of the
New York Convention. However, Dallah can be factually
distinguished. In Dallah, the question was whether Pakistan was
a party to an arbitration agreement given that it never signed
the agreement itself. The scenario in Dallah is like the one in
First Options as it considers the formation of the arbitration
agreement. It is not a question of scope, as is the issue in
the present case.

12

 

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 Filed 03/14/11 Page 13 of 25

apply when parties have agreed to arbitrate but disagree on
whether a particular matter is arbitrable is a strong
presumption of arbitrability." Consol. Rail Corp., 1996 WL
137587, at * 7 (citing Moses H Cone Mem’l Hosp. v. Mercury
Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1983) ("any doubts concerning
the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of
arbitration)); India v. Cargill Inc., 867 F.2d 130, 133 (2d Cir.
1989)). As First Options is inapplicable to this case, the
Court will not conduct a de novo review of the Arbitrators’

Award.®

C. Section 10(a) of the FAA or Manifest Disregard

Section 10(a) of the FAA sets forth four situations in

which a court may vacate an arbitration award.’ In its Cross-

s As the Court has held that First Options is inapplicable,

the Court does not need to reach the issue of whether there was
clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties intended that
the question of arbitrability be decided by the Arbitrators.

7 Thailand has not filed a formal motion to vacate the award.

However, since WB seeks confirmation of the award and Thailand
opposes it, the Court treats Thailand’s “Cross-Motion to Dismiss
the Petition for Confirmation” as a motion to vacate the award.
See D.H. Blair & Co. v. Gottdiener, 462 F.3d 95, 112 (2d Cir.
2006) (noting that under the FAA, any objections to a
confirmation motion are treated as if a formal motion for

13

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 Filed 03/14/11 Page 14 of 25

Motion, Thailand does not even argue that any of the Section
10(a) factors apply. The Second Circuit has “consistently
accorded the narrowest of readings to [§ 10(a)] in order to
facilitate the purpose underlying arbitration: to provide
parties with efficient dispute resolution, thereby obviating the
need for protracted litigation.” ReliaStar Life Ins. Co. v. EMC
Nat‘l. Life Co., 564 F.3d 81, 85 (2d Cir. 2009) (citation
omitted). Thus, a party seeking vacatur of an arbitration
panel's decision “must clear a high hurdle.” Stolt-Nielson S.A.
v. AnimalFeeds Int'l Corp., 130 S.Ct. 1758, 1767 (2010). It is
not enough “to show that the panel committed an error--or even a
serious error. It is only when an arbitrator strays from
interpretation and application of the agreement and effectively
dispenses his own brand of industrial justice that his decision

may be unenforceable.” Id. (citation omitted).

Courts in this circuit have also vacated arbitration awards
that are in “manifest disregard of the law.” See TI. Co Metals,
LLC _v. Dempsey Pipe & Supply, Inc., 592 F.3d 329, 339 (2d Cir.
2010). While the future of the “manifest disregard” standard is
unsettled, see Stolt-Nielson, 130 S.Ct. at 1768 n. 3 (stating

that the Supreme Court would “not decide whether ‘manifest

 

vacatur has been made).

14

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 Filed 03/14/11 Page 15 of 25

disregard’ survives”), in the Second Circuit, “manifest
disregard” has been reconceptualized as “a judicial gloss” on
the FAA's specific grounds for vacatur, and so interpreted,
“remains a valid ground for vacating arbitration awards.” T. Co
Metals, 592 F.3d at 340 (citation omitted). “{[A]wards are
vacated on grounds of manifest disregard only in those
exceedingly rare instances where some egregious impropriety on
the part of the arbitrator is apparent.” Id. at 339 (citation

omitted).

The Court has engaged in a thorough review of the record
and the submissions of the Parties. In addition, on February 4,
2011, the Court held oral argument on the Petition and Cross-
Petition. The Court is satisfied that the Arbitrators’ award
meets the light burden imposed by Section 10(a) and the
“Manifest Disregard Standard.” While the Court finds it
unnecessary to review the Arbitrators’ Award de novo, it is
important to note that based on February 4, 2011 argument, there
is serious doubt as to whether, even on a de novo review,
Thailand would be able to overturn the Arbitrators’ well-

reasoned Award.

A few facts presented during oral argument weigh
conclusively in WB’s favor. While Thailand argues that a German

investor is not covered by the treaty arbitration provision
15

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 _ Filed 03/14/11 Page 16 of 25

unless he has obtained a CA, there have been only eight CAs
issued during a forty-year period of German investment in
Thailand. (See Transcript of Oral Argument at 30, Schneider v.
Kingdom of Thailand, No. 10-2729 (S.D.N.Y. argued Feb. 4,
2011)). Moreover, none of the applicants for these CAs had BOI
approval. (Id.) In other words, there is not a single example
of a German investor in Thailand who had both the BOI
certificate and the CA. (Id. at 32.) These facts support WB’s

arguments.

Further, the project in question here was specifically
requested by the Thailand government and was approved at various
levels of this same government. Thailand never gave WB any
indication that a CA was required.® Yet, once this dispute
arose, Thailand claimed that under the treaty arbitration
provision, WB’s investment did not qualify for treaty protection
unless a CA was issued. While such a reading of the arbitration
provision appears plausible on its face, the facts and

circumstances here do not support Thailand’s position. (See

8 WB has presented evidence suggesting that, long before WB’s

investment, Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs considered
BOI sufficient for treaty protection. Id. at 35-36. Thailand,
in response, has only relied on the argument of counsel on this
point.

Thailand, No. 10-2729 (S.D.N.Y. argued Feb. 4, 2011)).

D. Forum Non Conveniens
1. Applicable Law for Forum Non Conveniens

“A federal court has discretion to dismiss a case on the
ground[s] of forum non conveniens when an alternative forum has
jurisdiction to hear [the] case, and ... trial in the chosen
forum would establish ... oppressiveness and vexation to a
defendant ... out of all proportion to plaintiff's convenience,
or ... the chosen forum [is] inappropriate because of
considerations affecting the court's own administrative and
legal problems.” Sinochem Int'l Co. v. Malaysia Int'l Shipping
Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 429 (2007) (quoting American Dredging Co. v.
Miller, 510 U.S. 443, 447-48 (1994)). This Court has broad
discretion in applying the forum non conveniens doctrine. Norex
Petroleum Ltd. v. Access Indus., Inc., 416 F.3d 146, 153 (2d
Cir. 2005). In exercising this discretion, courts consider: (1)
the degree of deference afforded to plaintiff's choice of forum;
(2) whether the alternative forum is adequate; and (3) the
balance of the public and private interests implicated in the

choice of forum. Norex Petroleum, 416 F.3d at 153. “Although the

17

 

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 Filed 03/14/11 Page 18 of 25

[Inter-American] Convention establishes jurisdiction in the
United States as a signatory state through a venue statute
appended to the [FAA], there remains the authority to reject
that jurisdiction for reasons of convenience, judicial economy
and justice.” In the Matter of Arbitration Between Monegasque De
Reassurances S.A.M. v. Nak Naftogaz of Ukraine, 311 F.3d 488,

494 (2d Cir. 2002) (“Monegasque”).

2. Deference to WB’s Choice of Forum

“A domestic petitioner's choice of its home forum receives
great deference, while a foreign petitioner's choice of a United
States forum receives less deference.” Monegasque, 311 F.3d at
498. However, deference is measured on a “sliding scale.”
Monegasque, 311 F.3d at 498. “The more it appears that a
domestic or foreign plaintiff's choice of forum has been
dictated by reasons that the law recognizes as valid, the
greater the deference that will be given to the plaintiff's

forum choice.” Iragorri_v. United Tech. Corp., 274 F.3d 65, 71-

72 (2d Cir. 2001) (en banc).

As a foreign Petitioner, WB's choice of a United States
forum receives less deference than if it were a domestic

petitioner. Nevertheless, WB is still entitled to some

18

 

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 Filed 03/14/11 Page 19 of 25

deference. Varnelo v. Eastwind Transp. Ltd., 2003 WL 230741, *8

(S.D.N.¥. Feb. 3, 2003). There is no indication that WB's
choice of forum was motivated by forum-shopping considerations.
In addition, WB is not seeking to resolve any dispute or conduct
extensive trial proceedings; instead it seeks only to confirm

its Award. D.H. Blair & Co., Inc. v. Gottdiener, 462 F.3d 95,

 

110 (2d Cir. 2006) (“[Aln arbitration award is a summary
proceeding that merely makes what is already a final arbitration
award a judgment of the court.”). Accordingly, this Court

affords deference to WB's choice of forum.

3. Adequacy of the Alternative Forum

“An alternative forum is ordinarily adequate if the
defendants are amenable to service of process there and the
forum permits litigation of the subject matter of the dispute.”
Monegasque, 311 F.3d at 499. Thailand argues that Thailand is
an adequate alternative forum. However, the Court does not
decide whether Thailand is an adequate alternate forum because,
as discussed below, WB’s choice of forum and the Gilbert factors
(see infra), weigh in favor of retaining jurisdiction.
Therefore, the Court assumes for the purposes of this motion

that Thailand would be an adequate alternate forum. See Int'l

19

Equity Investments, Inc. v. Cico, 427 F.Supp. 2d 503, 506-07

(S.D.N.¥. 2006) (retaining jurisdiction despite assuming that
there was an adequate alternative forum); Eclaire Advisor Ltd.

Daewoo Eng’g. & Constr. Co., Ltd., 375 F.Supp.2d 257, 265

(S.D.N.¥.2005) (same) .

4. Public and Private Interest Factors

“A district court is constrained to balance two sets of
factors in determining whether there should be an adjudication
in a petitioner's chosen forum or in the alternative forum
suggested by the respondent.” Monegasque, 311 F.3d at 500
(citing Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 507-09 (1947)).
The private interest factors pertain to, inter alia, the
convenience of the litigants, the relative ease of access to
sources of proof, and the availability of compulsory process for
attendance of unwilling witnesses. Monegasque, 311 F.3d at 500.
“[T]he court should focus on the precise issues that are likely
to be actually tried, taking into consideration the convenience
of the parties and the availability of witnesses and the
evidence needed for the trial of these issues.” Iragorri, 274
F.3d at 74. The public interest factors “include the

administrative difficulties associated with court congestion;

20

the imposition of jury duty upon those whose community bears no
relationship to the litigation; the local interest in resolving
local disputes; and the problems implicated in the application
of foreign law.” Monegasque, 311 F.3d at 500 (citing Gilbert,

330 U.S. at 508-09); Tel. Sys. Int’l., Inc. v. Network Telecom

 

PLC, 303 F.Supp. 2d 377, 384 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).

Here, the private interest factors do not weigh in favor of
forum non conveniens dismissal here as this dispute was resolved
in arbitration and all that is left is the narrow issue of
confirmation. See Monegasque, 311 F.3d at 500. Thailand
attempts to present this confirmation as a complex matter that
requires additional submission of evidence and full-blown de
novo review by this Court.° However, as the Court holds, infra,
the issue before the Court - the scope of the Parties’ agreement
to arbitrate - is a narrow one that requires no additional
evidence or de novo review. Accordingly, the private interest

factors weigh against a forum non conveniens dismissal.

The public interest factors do not weigh strongly in favor,
or against, dismissal. The factors that weigh against dismissal
° Thailand describes the additional evidence it would submit
to assist the Court in deciding the confirmation motions in a
letter of February 4, 2011. WB’s refutes Thailand’s position in
a letter dated February 14, 2011. This further undercuts
Thailand’s argument that dismissal is appropriate here.

include, first, American courts do have an interest in enforcing
commercial arbitration agreements in international contracts.
See Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U.S. 506, 520 n.15 (1974).
Second, even though this case is a non-local dispute with non-
local parties, no additional evidence would be helpful to the
Court and there are no issues of foreign law present. There is
also simply no evidence that Thailand is burdened in any way by

proceeding in the United States.

On the other hand, it is true that there are few, if any,
actual connections with the United States “other than the fact
that the United States is a Convention signatory.” Monegasque,
311 F.3d at 500. Thailand strongly asserts that the Parties and
the dispute’s lack of contacts with the United States, coupled
with the fact that Thailand that it has no assets in the United
States, favors strongly in favor of dismissal. Thailand argues
that this is especially true given that WB seeks to collect an
almost $40 million arbitration Award. Thailand is correct that
a lack of assets is a factor that does weigh in favor of
dismissal. Allstate Life Ins. Co. v. Linter Group Ltd., 994
F.2d 996, 1001 (2d Cir. 1993) (affirming dismissal on forum non
conveniens grounds, noting that the district court “properly
recognized that any judgment...will have to be enforced in

Australia where all of the Banks’ assets are located”).

22

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 _ Filed 03/14/11 Page 23 of 25

However, Petitioner disputes that Thailand has no assets in
the United States and asserts that any search of assets should
be the product of post-judgment discovery. WB also argues that
even if Thailand has no assets currently in the United States,
it may have assets here in the future and this reality should
not overcome WB’s choice of forum. Given the competing
interests on both sides, it is clear that the public interest

factors do not weigh strongly in favor, or against, dismissal.

Further, this case is inapposite to the facts in
Monegasque. In Monegasque, the Second Circuit affirmed a
district court’s judgment dismissing an arbitration proceeding
on forum non conveniens grounds. 311 F.3d at 500-01. The Second
Circuit found that both the private interest factors and public
interest factors weighed in favor of dismissal. Id. at 500.
Unlike the summary proceeding here, the Second Circuit found
that one of the parties in Monegasque, the Ukraine, would be
entitled to discovery and, most probably, a trial on the factual
issues as the Ukraine was a non-signer to the arbitration
agreement at issue. Id. The private factors in Monegasque
weighed in favor of dismissal as “the entire proceeding would be
more easy, expeditious and inexpensive” in the Ukraine. Id. A
dismissal of WB’s arbitration petition here would likely only

increase the cost of this arbitration dispute and further delay

23

Case 1:10-cv-02729-DAB Document 14 Filed 03/14/11 Page 24 of 25

its resolution. In addition, in Monegasque, the Second Circuit
also dealt with the public interest factor that there were
outstanding issues of Ukrainian and Russian law to be decided.
Id. There are no such outstanding issues of foreign law to be

decided in the case here.

The Court has determined that the public interest factors
are neutral on the issue of dismissal and the Court has assumed
that there is an alternative forum available. However, the
private interest factors and Petitioner’s choice of forum weigh
against dismissal on forum non conveniens grounds. Given this
analysis, WB’s choice of forum will be given deference and the
Court DENIES Thailand’s Cross-Motion to dismiss the Petition on

forum non conveniens grounds.

III. CONCLUSION

For the reasons above, the Court GRANTS WB’s Petition to
confirm the July 1, 2009 arbitration Award in favor of WB and
against Thailand and DENIES Thailand’s Cross-Petition. The
Clerk is DIRECTED to enter final judgment in favor of Petitioner
Werner Schneider, acting in his capacity as insolvency
administrator of Walter Bau Ag (In Liquidation), and against The

Kingdom of Thailand in the amount of: (1) EURO 29.21 million,

plus interest at the six month successive Euribor rate, plus 2%
per year, beginning on December 3, 2006 until the date of
payment of the award, compounded semi-annually; and (2) EURO
1,806,560, plus interest at the six month successive Euribor
rate, plus 2% per year, beginning on July 1, 2009 until the date
of payment of the award, compounded semi-annually. The Clerk is

DIRECTED to close the docket in this case.

SO ORDERED.
