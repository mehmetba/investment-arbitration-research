INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This proceeding concerns an application for annulment (the “Application”) brought by the
Kingdom of Spain with respect to the Award rendered on 31 July 2019 in SolEs Badajoz
GmbH v. Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/38) (the “Underlying
Arbitration”), as rectified by the Tribunal’s Decision on Rectification of the Award on

5 December 2019 (the “Award”).

For convenience and notwithstanding paragraph 8.2 of Procedural Order No. 1, this
Decision will continue to use the “Claimant” or “SolEs” to refer to SolEs Badajoz GmbH
and “Spain” for the Kingdom of Spain, as in the original proceeding. The Claimant and
Spain are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Parties”, and individually referred to

as a “Party”. The Parties’ representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

The Award determined a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty
which entered into force on 16 April 1998 for the Federal Republic of Germany and the
Kingdom of Spain (the “ECT”) and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14

October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The Underlying Arbitration concerned a dispute in the photovoltaic (“PV”) sector between
SolEs and Spain arising out of measures implemented by the latter modifying the
regulatory and economic regime applicable to producers of electricity from PV energy

sources.

In the Award, the Tribunal upheld the Claimant’s objection to jurisdiction with respect to
the claim that a 7% tax measure by the Claimant (the “TWPEE”) violated the ECT. The
Tribunal otherwise held that it had jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the ECT
over the Claimant’s claims. The Tribunal also found that Spain failed to accord fair and
equitable (“FET”) treatment to the Claimant pursuant to Article 10(1) of the ECT and

awarded the Claimant EUR 40.98 million, with interest (this amount was later rectified to

EUR 40.49 million in the Tribunal’s Decision on Rectification of 5 December 2019 (the

“Decision on Rectification”)).

Spain applied for annulment of the Award on the basis of Article 52(1) of the ICSID
Convention, identifying three grounds for annulment: (i) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded
its powers (Article 52(1)(b)); (ii) there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of
procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and (iii) the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which the
Award is based (Article 52(1)(e)).

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 1 April 2020, ICSID received Spain’s Application together with Annexes 001 to 016.!
The Application also contained a request under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and
Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “ICSID
Arbitration Rules”) for the stay of enforcement of the Award until the Application was

decided (the “Request for Stay”).

On 3 April 2020, pursuant to Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-
General of ICSID registered the Application. On the same date, in accordance with
Arbitration Rule 54(2), the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the enforcement of
the Award had been provisionally stayed. On 9 April 2020, Counsel for the Claimant

submitted a power of attorney from SolEs for this annulment proceeding.

On 8 May 2020, following an exchange of correspondence between the Parties and the
Secretariat,? and in accordance with Rules 6 and 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the
Parties were notified that an ad hoc Committee composed of Mr. Cavinder Bull, SC, a
national of Singapore, designated as President of the Committee, Mr. Colm O hOisin, SC,
a national of Ireland, and Mr. Noé Fernando Piérola Castro, a national of Peru and

Switzerland, had been constituted (the “Committee”). On the same date, the Parties were

With its Observations on the European Commission’s Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing
Party of 27July 2020, Spain provided two tables of concordance showing both the Annex number and the R or
RL number of exhibits and legal authorities. See List of Exhibits (R) and List of Legal Authorities (RL), both
dated 27July 2020.

See communications with the Parties of 22, 28 and 30 April, 1 and 5 May 2020.

notified that Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu, Team Leader/Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as

Secretary of the ad hoc Committee.

10. On 9 June 2020, pursuant to the calendar agreed by the Parties on 19 May 2020, Spain filed
its Submission in Support of the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award,

together with Annexes 017 to 033.

11. On 23 June 2020, SolEs filed its Response to Applicant's Request to Continue Stay,
together with Legal Authorities* CL-0001 to CL-0024.

12. On 24 June 2020, the Committee’s First Session was held by teleconference.

13. On the same date, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1, including the Procedural
Calendar agreed by the Parties, which provided, inter alia, for the hearing on stay of
enforcement of the Award, on 30 July 2020. By emails of 29 June and 1 July 2020, the
Parties proposed a jointly agreed hearing schedule, which the Committee approved through

its Secretary on 1 July 2020.

14. On 7 July 2020, Spain filed its Reply in Support of the Continuation of the Stay of

Enforcement of the Award, together with Annexes 034 to 058.

15. On 17 July 2020, the European Commission (the “EC”) filed an Application for Leave to
Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party (the “EC Application”) seeking the Committee’s
permission to intervene in the present annulment proceedings, including on Spain’s
application for the continuation of the stay of enforcement of Award. The EC Application

was made pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

16. On 21 July 2020, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder to Applicant's Request to Continue Stay,
together with Exhibits C-0001 to C-0004 and Legal Authorities CL-0025 to CL-0027.

3 With its Counter-Memorial on Annulment dated 15 January 2021 (resubmitted on 23 February 2021), SolEs
provided two tables renumbering the exhibits (C) and legal authorities (CL). See List of Exhibits and List of Legal
Authorities, both dated 15 January 2021.

On 27 July 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 (“PO2”) On the

Organization of the Hearing on Stay of Enforcement of the Award.

On the same date, further to the Committee’s invitation, the Parties each submitted
observations on the EC Application. Spain filed its observations together with Legal

Authority RL-0145.

On 29 July 2020, as contemplated in Section 13 of PO2, SolEs and Spain each submitted
a demonstrative exhibit, RD-001 and CD-0001, respectively. On 30 July 2020, the
Committee held the hearing on stay of the enforcement of the Award (the “Hearing on
Stay”) by videoconference. In addition to the Members of the Committee and its Secretary,

the following Party representatives attended the Hearing on Stay:

On behalf of the Kingdom of Spain:

Mr. Alberto Torré Molés, Abogacia General del Estado
Mr. Pablo Elena Abad, Abogacia General del Estado
Ms. Gabriela Cerdeiras, Abogacia General del Estado

On behalf of SolEs Badajoz GmbH:

Mr. Charles Kaplan, Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe (Europe) LLP
Mr. Tunde Oyewole, Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe (Europe) LLP
Ms. Sarah Lajugie, Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe (Europe) LLP
Mr. Thomas Hopp, Voigt & Collegen GmbH

On 12 August 2020, each Party submitted comments on the other Party’s observations on
the EC Application. Spain submitted its comments together with Legal Authorities RL-
0146 to RL-0152.

On 26 August 2020, the Committee issued its Decision on the Continuation of the Stay of
Enforcement of the Award (the “Decision on Stay”). The Committee decided that the stay
of enforcement of the Award should be continued unconditionally until the conclusion of
the present annulment proceeding, and held that “it is unnecessary to consider the EC

Application in respect of this issue”.* The Committee indicated that it would “separately

consider the rest of the EC Application together with the Parties’ observations and their

comments on each other’s observations” >

On 17 September 2020, the Committee issued its Decision on the European Commission’s
Application for Leave to Intervene as Non-Disputing Party. The Committee found, inter
alia, that the EC’s proposed submissions mirrored the arguments raised by Spain in support
of annulment and, therefore, the EC’s intervention could not bring a “perspective,
particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties” as
required under Rule 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. In addition, given that the
EC’s position on the issues it intended to address was substantially the same as Spain’s and
diametrically opposed to SolEs’s, the EC’s intervention would have placed an additional
procedural burden on SolEs to respond to the EC’s submissions. In light of these findings,

the Committee decided to deny the EC Application.

On 25 September 2020, Spain filed a request under paragraph 15.3 of POI to add a new
“Tab Al” to Exhibit MGA 16 of Spain’s Second Report on Quantum in the Underlying
Arbitration dated 15 September 2017.

On 2 October 2020, Spain filed its Memorial on Annulment (the “Memorial on
Annulment”), along with the Expert Report Assessment of the Damages Payable to the
Claimant in light of the Arbitral Award issued on 31 July 2019 of Altran MaC Group
together with Exhibits MGA 16 and Table P, Exhibits R-0375 to R-0394, and Legal
Authorities RL-0153 to RL-0189. On the same date, SolEs filed its observations regarding
Spain’s request of 25 September 2020 under paragraph 15.3 of POL.

Further to the Committee inquiry of 26 September 2020, the Parties also confirmed on
2 October 2020 that they were available to hold the Hearing on Annulment on 13 and 14
October 2021, with 15 October 2021 reserved for deliberations (instead of 5-6 October
2021, with 7 October 2021 reserved for deliberations, as the procedural calendar then

provided).

On 6 October 2020, the Committee decided to provisionally allow Spain’s request of 25
September 2020 on the basis that the new “Tab A1” did not contain any new evidence that

was not presented in the Underlying Arbitration.

On 8 October 2020, Spain submitted an amended version of the Expert Report Assessment
of the Damages Payable to the Claimant in light of the Arbitral Award issued on 31 July
2019 of Altran MaC Group (“AMG’s New Report”), dated 7 October 2020, together with
Exhibit MGA 16.

On 15 January 2021, SolEs filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment (the “Counter-
Memorial on Annulment”), along with Brattle’s Analysis of the damages awarded,
together with Exhibits BA-0001 to BA-0004; Exhibits C-0198 to C-0215 and Legal
Authorities CL-0178 to CL-0238. On 23 February 2021, SolEs resubmitted its Counter-
Memorial on Annulment and accompanying documents, with certain clerical corrections,

following a communication from the Centre on 11 February 2021.

On 2 April 2021, in response to the Committee’s communication of 6 October 2020 and
further to SolEs’s 15 January 2021 Counter-Memorial on Annulment, SolEs filed a request
for the Committee to rule definitively that the updated Exhibit MGA 16 should be removed
from the record. On 6 April 2021, Spain filed its observations on SolEs’s request of
2 April 2021. On 8 April 2020, the Committee informed the Parties through its Secretary
that it saw no need to issue the requested order at this time. In the Committee’s view, the
concerns raised by SolEs in its request of 15 January and 2 April 2021 could be dealt with
by the Parties and the ad hoc Committee once it was clear how document MGA 16 bis was

being used by Spain.

On 15 April 2021, Spain filed its Reply on Annulment (the “Reply on Annulment”), along
with the Expert Report of Prof. Ricardo Gosalbo Bono (with Exhibits 01 to 29), the
Rebuttal Report of Altran MaC Group (“AMG’s Rebuttal Report”), Exhibits R-0395 to
R-0415, and Legal Authorities RL-0190 to RL-0243. Spain also submitted a corrected

version of its Memorial on Annulment.

On 11 May 2021, SolEs requested an amendment to the Procedural Calendar for the
submission of its subsequent pleading. On 12 May 2021, Spain confirmed its agreement
for an extension of the deadline requested by SolEs. On 14 May 2021, the Committee

transmitted an amended Procedural Calendar according to the Parties’ agreement.

On 20 July 2021, pursuant to the Procedural Calendar as amended on 14 May 2021, SolEs
filed its Rejoinder on Annulment (the “Rejoinder on Annulment”), along with Brattle
Annulment Rebuttal Report, the Expert Opinion of Prof. Piet Eeckhout (with Exhibits PE-
0001 to PE-0045), Exhibits C-0216 and C-0217, and Legal Authorities CL-0239 to CL-
0244.

On 28 July 2021, considering the persisting uncertainties related to the current COVID-19
pandemic and bearing in mind the provisions of paragraphs 10.1 and 10.2 of POI, the
Committee invited the Parties to confer on the way they wished to proceed in relation to
the Hearing on Annulment, including the possibility of holding the Hearing remotely by

video, if necessary, under the circumstances.

By email of 6 August 2021, SolEs submitted that “everything should be done to preserve
the possibility of holding an in-person hearing” and proposed that the issue be revisited at
the beginning of September 2021. By email of the same date, Spain expressed a preference
for an in-person hearing and agreed that the issue should be revisited in early September

2021.

On 10 August 2021, the Committee informed the Parties of its acceptance of their joint
proposal to revisit the issue of the hearing format in September. As a precautionary step,
the Committee also invited the Parties to consider (i) if necessary and subject to
paragraph 10 of Procedural Order No. 1, the possibility of holding the hearing in person in
a venue other than Paris, including in particular the IDRC in London or the Peace Palace
in The Hague, and (ii) what initial preparations might have to be made should the

circumstances require that the hearing be held virtually.

By emails of 24, 25, 27 August, and 1 and 2 September 2021,° the Centre provided updates
as to the availability of hearing venues in Europe for in-person hearings. On
2 September 2021, Spain informed the Centre that it had contacted SolEs with a view to

reaching an agreement regarding the Hearing.

By email of 7 September 2021, SolEs inquired on behalf of the Parties whether the
Committee would be available to hold the Hearing during the following time periods: from

13 to 17 December 2021; or from 9 to 11 February 2022.

On 8 September 2021, the Committee informed the Parties of its unavailability on the
suggested additional hearing dates, and of their inclination to maintain the current dates. In
order to facilitate the discussion on the hearing venue and format, the Committee proposed
to hold a virtual meeting with the Parties on 15 September 2021. The meeting took place

by videoconference.

Further to the discussions held at the 15 September 2021 virtual meeting, the Committee
issued the following directions on the same day: (i) the current hearing dates, namely 13-
14 October 2021, were confirmed; (ii) the hearing would be held in person in Paris, France;
(iii) the hearing venue would be Delos Dispute Resolution; (iv) it was the Committee’s
understanding that Spain intended to cross-examine the experts for SolEs at the Hearing
and that SolEs did not intend to cross-examine the experts for Spain, who therefore would
not be required to testify or otherwise address the Committee though they might attend the
hearing; (v) the pre-hearing organizational meeting would be held on 27 September 2021

virtually.

On 24 September 2021, Spain filed a request for leave to introduce three new legal
authorities into the record under paragraph 15.6 of PO1, namely (i) the Judgment of the
Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) of September 2,
2021, issued in Republic of Moldova v. Komstroy (Case C-741/19) (the “Komstroy
Judgment”); (ii) the European Commission’s communication on State Aid SA.54155

(2021/NN) — Arbitration award to Antin (the “EC Antin Communication”); and (c) the

Award rendered on August 17, 2021 in STEAG GmbH vy. Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case
No. ARB/15/4) (the “STEAG Award”).

On 27 September 2021, the Committee held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the
Parties by videoconference to discuss outstanding procedural, administrative, and logistical

matters in preparation for the Hearing on Annulment.

On the same date, SolEs submitted its observations on Spain’s request of 24 September

2021 under paragraph 15.6 of POL.

On 29 September 2021, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning the

organization of the Hearing (““PO3”).

On the same date, the Committee notified the Parties of its decision regarding Spain’s
request of 24 September 2021 under paragraph 15.6 of PO1. The Committee noted that
both the Komstroy Judgment and the STEAG Award were issued well after Spain filed its
Reply on Annulment, and that Spain did not specify when the EC Antin Communication
was issued. In light of this, the Committee decided to admit the Komstroy Judgment and
the STEAG Award, but not the EC Antin Communication. The Committee further held that
the Respondent was thus at liberty to refer to the Komstroy Judgment and the STEAG
Award at the Hearing, and that the Claimant could comment on these documents at the

Hearing and if necessary, in writing within seven days after the Hearing.

On 13 and 14 October 2021, the Committee held the Hearing in Paris, France. In addition
to the Members of the Committee and the Secretary of the Committee, the following

persons attended the Hearing:

of PO3. On 2 November 2021, in response to an inquiry from SolEs, the Committee
confirmed that (i) there would be no post-hearing briefs and that Annex A to Procedural
Order No. 1 was amended accordingly*; (ii) cost submissions were expected to be filed by
22 November 2021 unless otherwise agreed by the Parties; (iii) the Parties were invited to
submit their agreed corrections to the hearing transcript, if any, by 17 November 2021; and
(iv) it remained committed to issuing the Decision on Annulment on 22 February 2022 and
if the Committee was not in a position to issue the Decision by that date, the Parties would
be notified accordingly and provided with a status update, as contemplated in paragraph 5.3
of POL. On 3 November 2021, Spain informed the Committee of the Parties’ agreement to

submit their agreed corrections to the transcript, if any, by 22 November 2021.

On 22 November 2021, the Parties each submitted their submissions on costs. On 22 and
24 November 2021, they also informed the Committee that they disagreed as to how the
hearing transcripts ought to be corrected. On 30 November 2021, the Committee offered

two options to the Parties for them to implement their corrections to the transcript.

On 7 December 2021, the Parties informed the Committee that they had agreed on the

second option offered by the Committee and jointly filed their corrections to the English

and Spanish-language transcripts, which included the Parties’ points of disagreements as

to the corrections to be made.
The proceeding was declared closed on 21 February 2022.

Section III of this Decision sets out the standards applicable to the grounds of annulment
invoked by Spain. Section IV addresses the claims raised by Spain with respect to the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the applicable law. Section V deals with the claims relating
to the Tribunal’s assessment of liability. Section VI addresses the claims concerning the
Tribunal’s establishment of damages. Section VII addresses Spain’s allegations that there
has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Finally, Section VIII

sets out the Committee’s findings on the allocation of costs.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS

Spain requests the annulment of the Award pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention

on the grounds that:

(i) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers;

(ii) the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based; and that,

(iii) there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.

Before addressing the specific claims for annulment submitted by Spain, the Committee

sets out the legal standard in the light of which those claims are examined.

A. GENERAL LEGAL STANDARD APPLICABLE TO ANNULMENTS
ji Spain’s Position

Spain recognizes that the annulment proceedings are not a new opportunity to re-arbitrate

the dispute and states that it does not intend to do so.° That said, Spain emphasizes that

Reply on Annulment, 15.

54.

55.

56.

most annulment committees have acknowledged that there is no presumption in favor of

or against the annulment in the ICSID Convention.!°

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

As a general point, the Claimant stresses that an ICSID annulment is not an appeal. Article
53 of the ICSID Convention states that: “Zhe award shall be binding on the parties and
shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this
Convention’! (emphasis added). In the Claimant’s submission, annulment (which is

provided for in the Convention) is therefore a remedy other than an appeal. '*

According to the Claimant, commentators have noted that an ad hoc committee’s power to
annul an award does not allow it to amend the award or replace it by its own decision. The
ICSID annulment process is only concerned with the legitimacy of the process of the
decision, not its substantive correctness. Annulment therefore takes as its premise “the
record before the Tribunal’.'> Unlike an appeal, the ICSID annulment process does not
provide an opportunity for a losing party to raise new arguments on the merits or introduce
new evidence. A party may not present before the ad hoc committee new arguments of fact

or law that it failed to raise in the original arbitral proceeding. *

(iii) | The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee notes that it is undisputed that an annulment process is distinct from an
appeal.'> Unlike an appellate court, the Committee is limited in its competence to assess
the legitimacy of the process leading up to the Tribunal’s decision, not its substantive
correctness in terms of law or facts. With this in mind, the Committee turns to the

applicable legal standard of each specific grounds of annulment raised by Spain below.

B. ARTICLE 52(1)(B): WHETHER A TRIBUNAL HAS MANIFESTLY EXCEEDED ITS
POWERS

ji Spain’s Position

Spain relies on Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention which authorizes a party to

request the annulment of an award if the tribunal “manifestly exceeds its powers”.'°

Spain submits that a manifest excess of powers may exist, inter alia, when the Tribunal:

(i) does not apply the appropriate law, which occurs when the Tribunal ignores the

applicable law, or its erroneous interpretation or misapplication of the law is “so gross or

egregious as substantially to amount to failure to apply the proper law”;"’ (ii) exceeds its

jurisdiction or has no jurisdiction;'* or (iii) decides on matters not raised by the parties or

when, instead of applying the relevant provision of the BIT, the Tribunal applies standards

that are not included in that provision.!°

With regard to the standard of review, Spain cites, amongst other things, the Updated
Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID dated
5 May 2016 which summarizes that: “[t]he ‘manifest’ nature of the excess of powers has
been interpreted by most ad hoc committees to mean an excess that is obvious, clear or
self-evident, and which is discernable without the need for an elaborate analysis of the
award. However, some ad hoc committees have interpreted the meaning of ‘manifest’ to

require that the excess be serious or material to the outcome of the case”.”°

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

With regard to the standard of review for the specific ground of “manifest excess of

powers”, the Claimant submits that Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention imposes a

dual requirement for the annulment of an award: (i) there must be an excess of powers, and

(ii) this excess must be manifest.”!

The Claimant submits that the term ‘manifest’ is subject to two lines of interpretation,
namely, that an excess of powers is manifest if: (i) it can be discerned with little effort and
without deep analysis; and/or (ii) it is serious or material to the outcome of the case.”” The
Claimant submits that in practice, there is little practical relevance between these two
interpretations as annulment committees would be “hard pressed to use their discretionary
powers to annul the decision if the excess of powers has no material impact vis-a-vis the

parties or the dispute”.

Regarding the application of proper law in particular, the Claimant also stresses that many
ad hoc committees have embraced a distinction between the failure to apply the proper law

and the incorrect application of that law, and have found the threshold for the finding of an

annullable error of law to be “very high”.?+

(iii) |The Committee’s Analysis

Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention provides that either party may request the
annulment of an award on the ground “that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its
powers”. Based on this wording, the invocation of this ground requires an annulment
committee to examine two issues: (i) whether the tribunal “exceeded” the “powers”

conferred upon it by the parties, and, if so, (ii) whether such excess occurred

“manifestly”.?>

Various annulment committees have also read Article 52(2)(a) as encompassing a two-fold analysis. See e.g. RL-
0185-ENG, CDC Group ple v. Republic of the Seychelles, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14, Decision of the ad hoc
Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Republic of Seychelles dated 29 June 2005 (“CDC Group”),

The first question entails a comparison between, on the one hand, the tribunal’s actions as
reflected in the award, and on the other, the powers conferred on the tribunal by the ICSID
Convention, other applicable norms, and the matters submitted by the parties for the

tribunal’s decision.”¢

In addressing this question, an annulment committee may find that a tribunal acted within
its powers. However, it may also find that the tribunal’s actions diverge from those powers,

either by excess or by omission in the fulfilment of the assigned duties.

On the question of whether an excess of powers is “manifest”, the Committee notes that
this ground for annulment arises in the context of a limited number of annulment grounds
under Article 52(1), 7” and within the confines of a remedial mechanism, which is deemed
by the ICSID Convention an exception to the binding and non-appealable nature of
awards.”* In this regard, the Committee’s view is that this standard must be understood in
the light of the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention, which may be construed as to
ensure that mutual consent constitutes a “binding agreement” requiring compliance with

arbitral awards.”? Accordingly, to justify annulment, the excess of power at issue must be

discernable from a plain reading of the award, and perceived or recognized as such by an

annulment committee without difficulty.*°

67. The Committee accepts the Parties’ submissions that a manifest excess of powers may exist
in a variety of situations. In particular, a tribunal’s failure to apply the relevant law may be
“manifest” from the lack of reference to (and reliance on) the law agreed upon by the
parties. That failure could also be revealed if the tribunal effectively applies a set of rules
other than that agreed upon by the parties.*! Within this set of circumstances, there is also
the special case of the non-application of the applicable law due to a legal error of such a
nature or flagrancy as to render that application ineffective. This is a qualified failure as it
would require the finding of an erroneous interpretation or misapplication of the law “so
gross or egregious as substantially to amount to failure to apply the proper law”. It is
recognized that distinguishing between non-application of the applicable law and the
incorrect application of that law may be a particularly complex task** and that the threshold

for finding an annullable error of law is very high.*+

30 The Committee’s understanding of the term “manifestly” within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) is similar to that
held by other annulment committees (see RL-0112-ENG, Occidental, 57; CL-0194-ENG, SGS Société Générale
de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of Paraguay, 1CSID Case No. ARB/07/29, Decision on Annulment dated 19 May

dated 30 December 2015 (“Tulip”), 456; RL-0145-ENG, Micula, 9123. Other annulment committees have
provided meanings to the term “manifestly” that are not only related to the obviousness of the excess of powers
at issue. (see R-0395-ENG, Updated Background Paper, 83).

As noted by Spain in its Reply on Annulment, 934, fn. 29, the Committee in Enron stated that the distinction

As set out in the Duke Energy v. Peru committee’s decision, the practical question to ask
is whether the opinion of the tribunal is so untenable that it cannot be supported by

reasonable arguments:

“An ad hoc committee will not therefore annul an award if the
tribunal’s disposition on a question of law is tenable, even if the
committee considers that it is incorrect as a matter of law. [...] Without
reopening debates on questions of fact, a committee can take into
account the facts of the case as they were in the record before the
tribunal to check whether it could come to its solution, however
debatable. Is the opinion of the tribunal so untenable that it cannot be
supported by reasonable arguments? A debatable solution _is_not
amenable to annulment, since the excess of powers would not then be
‘manifest’” (emphasis added).*>

Separately, the Committee accepts that the standard may also apply where a tribunal
expands the scope of its powers in its award of damages. As was the case in the Occidental
decision where the tribunal had “illicitly expanded the scope of its jurisdiction” by
“compensating a protected investor for an investment which is beneficially owned by a
non-protected investor” *°

In that case, the tribunal had awarded the claimant damages based on the 100% present
value of the investment’s cash flows when the claimant only owned 60% of the investment
(with the remainder being owned by a third party that was not protected by the treaty in
question).>” In this context, the annulment committee partially annulled the award, and
reduced the compensation owed to the claimant from 100% to 60%, then applied a
reduction factor which was explained in the award.** In the words of the Occidental

committee, this entailed a very simple arithmetic calculation:

“Tt is true that annulment committees are not empowered to amend or
replace awards. But this is not the task at hand. What is required in this
case, in which the Committee is partially annulling the Award, is for the
Annulment Committee to substitute the Tribunal’s figure of damages

with the correct one. If this task can be performed without further
submissions from the Parties and without additional marshalling of
evidence, committees should be entitled to do so. Basic reasons of
procedural economy speak in favour of this solution. There is no need
for the parties to incur the additional cost and delay of going through
a second investment arbitration, when the correct number can be

inserted by the annulment committee, after performing a very simple

arithmetic calculation and without further input from the parties.
This is the case in the present arbitration” (emphasis added).*°

C. ARTICLE 52(1)(E): WHETHER AN AWARD HAS FAILED TO STATE REASONS
ji Spain’s Position
Spain argues that annulment committees have uniformly established that Articles 48(3) and

52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention require, at a minimum, that the ruling allows the reader

to “follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B.”.*°

According to Spain, the supporting reasons “must constitute an appropriate foundation for

the conclusions reached through such reasons”*!

and cannot be “insufficient or
inadequate” in that they “cannot, in themselves, be a reasonable basis for the solution

arrived at”. Further, annulment may be justified where the reasons given by the tribunal

are contradictory to its other findings* or frivolous (in that they are “manifestly irrelevant

and knowingly so to the tribunal’).

Spain further argues that the tribunal is obliged to deal with the problems, arguments and
evidence presented. The fact that a tribunal should “fail[] to address a particular question

submitted to it” or to “address certain evidence relevant to” its determination is equivalent

to not indicating the reasons and justifies an annulment.*5

(iv) |The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant stresses that “the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a
particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale” and “that point must itself
be necessary to the tribunal’s decision”.*° As a matter of principle, ad hoc committees
should not look into the adequacy of the tribunal’s reasoning,*’ nor should it assess the
“correctness or persuasiveness” of the reasoning in the award or inquire into the quality or

merits of the reasons.**

According to the Claimant, a handful of ad hoc committees have made the mistake of
misinterpreting the standard of Article 52(1)(e) to encompass “insufficient or inadequate”
reasons as a ground for annulment. The Claimant argues that the standard of Article
52(1)(e) is not preceded by any qualifier and therefore, the requirement of “sufficiently

pertinent” reasons goes against the wording of Article 52(1)(e).*”

The Claimant further argues that in order to serve as a ground for annulment,
“contradictory reasons” must be so egregious as to prevent the reader from understanding
the tribunal’s motives, leading to the conclusion that the tribunal had provided no reasons
at all.*° In other words, a finding of contradiction must be compelling (and not merely

arguable) lest the annulment procedure be transformed into an appeal mechanism.*!

As for “frivolous” reasons, the Claimant contends that this standard is a high one and that
Spain has selectively omitted to highlight that “an examination of the reasons presented by
a tribunal cannot be transformed into a re-examination of the correctness of the factual

and legal premises on which the award is based’.>* The Claimant stresses that:

“Committees do not have the power to review the adequacy of the
reasons set forth by the tribunal in its award. Rather, the role of the
committee is limited to analyzing whether a reader can understand how
the tribunal arrived at its conclusion. Broadening the scope of Article
52(1)(e) to comprise decisions with inadequate reasons would
transform the annulment proceeding into an appeal”.*>

(v) The Committee’s Analysis

Under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, a party may request the annulment of an

award on the ground that it “has failed to state the reasons on which it is based”.

In the Committee’s view, the immediate context provided by the limited number of
annulment grounds under Article 52(1), the prohibition set out in Article 53(1) from
subjecting an award to an appeal, and the finality of awards sought by the object and
purpose of the ICSID Convention, prevent this Committee from ascribing to
Article 52(1)(e) an expansive scope or a meaning that might amount to an appellate review.
On the other hand, the context provided by Article 48(3), which states that an award “shall
state the reasons upon which it is based”, would also prevent a narrow interpretation of
Article 52(1)(e) that might effectively render the obligation contained in Article 48(3)
meaningless. These competing considerations must be borne in mind when conducting an

evaluation of the scope of annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.

The Committee notes that in practice, annulment committees have considered that the
standard of failure to state reasons requires a review of whether a tribunal’s conclusion
could be followed through the reading of the stated reasons.*4 While various iterations of
this test have been espoused, it is well-established that at the minimum, the ruling must
allow the reader to “follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B.” *°. This

minimum standard is undisputed by the Parties.

The Committee accepts that in practice, ad hoc committees have considered that a failure

to state reasons can arise in varying situations; for example, where:

(a) there is a complete absence of reasons for the award or for a given conclusion;°°

(b) there is some apparent reasoning, but a critical lacuna in the explanation, which

basis for the decision insufficient, inadequate”, or “frivolous’

There has been debate between the Parties as to the appropriate standard of review to apply,
in particular with regard to whether a committee is entitled to question the “sufficiency” or
“frivolousness” of the reasoning provided.“ Given its mandate, this Committee is mindful
that it cannot conduct an examination of the reasons that may be regarded as an appeal, a
de novo reconsideration of them, an ex-post facto consideration of matters unresolved by
the Tribunal, a re-trial of facts, or a “quality control” of the Tribunal’s reasons. As such,
any assessment of the “sufficiency” or “frivolousness” of the reasoning provided must be
extremely measured, and cannot cross into the realm of a review of the adequacy of the

Tribunal’s reasoning.

That said, neither can this Committee pursue, on the other hand, an approach of full
deference to the Tribunal’s findings without examining on an unbiased, neutral, and
objective basis whether the Tribunal has indeed stated the reasons supporting its relevant

conclusions. While a failure to state reasons can take many forms, the ultimate question is

whether the Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal’s award is possible to follow “from

Point A. to Point B.”.® If so, there can be no basis for annulment on this ground.

Where annulment is sought on the grounds of contradictory reasons in particular (as Spain
seeks to do on certain grounds in this case), the Committee’s view is that such reasons
would only be a valid basis of annulment where the contradictions cause the
aforementioned reasons in the award to be incapable of standing together on any
reasonable reading of the decision. Such an approach is consistent with the committee’s
limited role in an annulment proceeding. On this issue, the Committee agrees with the

analysis set out by the Continental Casualty ad hoc committee:

“The Committee adds that for genuinely contradictory reasons to
cancel each other out, they must be such as to be incapable of standing
together on any reasonable reading of the decision. [...] In cases
where it is merely arguable whether there is a contradiction or
inconsistency in the tribunal’s reasoning, it is not for an annulment
committee to resolve that argument. Nor is it the role of an annulment
committee to express its own view on whether or not the reasons given
by the tribunal are logical or rational or correct” (emphasis added).°°

D. —_ ARTICLE 52(1)(D): WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN A SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A
FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE

ji Spain’s Position

Spain relies on Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention which states that a party may

request annulment of the award on the ground that “there has been a serious departure

from a fundamental rule of procedure”.

In particular, Spain relies on the fundamental rule that a party to an arbitration must be

given a full and fair opportunity to present its case, that is, the “right to be heard’.®

According to Spain, the right to be heard is the “right to state its claim or its defence and

to produce all arguments and evidence in support of it”®’ and includes the “fundamental

rule of equality of the parties”.”

Spain alleges that there are different ways in which the right to be heard can be breached,
namely: (i) when a party cannot present all the arguments and all the evidence that it deems
relevant;”! (ii) when one party does not have the opportunity to respond adequately to the
arguments and evidence presented by the other party;”? (iii) the unjustified denial by a
tribunal of an applicant’s request for production of documents, such as where the tribunal
cites lack of evidence as the basis for its decision and has previously denied requests for

documents for that evidence as suggested by the committee in Pey Casado.”

Spain also submits that the applicant for annulment does not have the obligation to
demonstrate that the result of the arbitration would have been different if the violated rule
of procedure had been respected, but only the severity of the breach.” According to Spain,
a deviation will be serious if a party is deprived of the protection afforded by the relevant

procedural rule.”>

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant does not dispute that a party may request annulment of the award on the
ground that “there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure”
under Article 52(1)(d). According to the Claimant, ad hoc committees have taken a strict

approach and required both that the departure of the rule be serious and that the rule in

question be fundamental.”

With regard to the “serious” element, the Claimant does not directly rebut Spain’s

argument that it is not obliged to demonstrate that the result of the arbitration would have

been different if the violated rule of procedure had been respected. While the Claimant
cites the Wena ad hoc committee’s decision that “/ijn order to be a ‘serious’ departure
from a fundamental rule of procedure, the violation of such a rule must have caused the
Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had
such a rule been observed”,”’ it also recognizes the differing approach taken by the Vivendi
Lad hoc committee which established that Article 52(1)(d) was concerned with the manner
in which the Tribunal proceeded (i.e. whether parties had a full and fair opportunity to be

heard at every stage of the proceedings), not the content of the decision.”

With regard to the “fundamental” element, the Claimant submits that previous committees
have considered this with reference to Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Model Law, which
mentions the equal treatment of parties and the right to be heard.”” The Claimant also
argues that not all ICSID Arbitration Rules are necessarily fundamental rules of
procedure.*® According to the Claimant, some committees have considered Article
52(1)(d) to refer to “a set of minimal standards of procedure to be respected as a matter of
o> 81

international law”,*' while others take a more restrictive approach that only rules of natural

justice are fundamental. **

With regard to the applicable standard in the context of document production requests in
particular, the Claimant argues that Spain has misrepresented the standard*? as the
authorities envisage the “mere possibility that such a situation may amount to an annulment

ground, not a rule set in stone as Spain presents” :5+

(a) In the Claimant’s submission, Spain’s reliance on Pey Casado is misplaced as: (i)

tribunal denied all of its discovery requests was ultimately rejected by the

committee;*> and (ii) the committee entertained the possibility that a denial of a
document production request may amount to a serious violation “only in the event”
that the tribunal then used the absence of evidence on the issues dealt with in the

denied evidentiary request to reach its conclusion.*°

(b) The Claimant also relies on Venezuela Holdings where the committee found that it
could not dispute the tribunal’s decision without an investigation into the
circumstances of the case, which “/ies plainly beyond the functions of an ad hoc
annulment committee”.’’ Further, the committee noted that the “only aspect

properly for consideration by the committee is the possible effect of the Tribunal’s

refusal to order disclosure”.®

(iii) |The Committee’s Analysis

It is not disputed that under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, a party may request
the annulment of an award on the ground “that there has been a serious departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure”. This wording implies three aspects that need to be
examined: (i) whether there is a fundamental rule of procedure affected; (ii) whether there

has been a departure from that procedural rule and (iii) whether that departure has been

“serious”.

Counter-Memorial on Annulment, 1184, citing RL-0177-ENG, Venezuela Holdings, 4132.

Other annulment committees have read these three aspects of Article 52(1)(d) as comprised into two: (i) the
identification of the (fundamental) rule of procedure and (ii) whether the departure from that rule has been serious.
For analytical reasons, this Committee considers that the second notion is to be divided into two questions:
whether there has been a departure and whether that departure is serious. See e.g. CL-0178-ENG, Amco II, 49.07;

9 must be identified at the outset of

On the first issue, the “fundamental rule of procedure
the analysis.°! In defining the procedural rule, it is relevant to bear in mind the distinction
drawn between a “rule of procedure” (in the sense of the process or the manner in which
the tribunal proceeded) and the tribunal’s decision (in the sense of the outcome of that
process or content of the decision).°? In practice, examples of fundamental rules of
procedure identified by ad hoc annulment committees concern (i) the equal treatment of
the parties, (ii) the right to be heard, (iii) the requirement of an independent and impartial
tribunal, (iv) the treatment of evidence and burden of proof, (v) the deliberations among a

tribunal’s members.”

In the present proceedings, Spain essentially relies on its fundamental right to be heard.
While Spain makes references to a violation of its “right of defence” and “unequal
treatment of the Parties” throughout its Memorial and Reply, Spain appears to be using
these terms interchangeably with the “right to be heard’, which it asserts includes the
“fundamental rule of equality of the parties”.°* Notably, Spain’s Memorial states that “[i]”
the present case, the Tribunal committed serious violations of the fundamental norms, and
in particular it seriously deviated from Spain's fundamental right to be heard, as will be

seen below” (emphasis added).*> The Claimant does not dispute that the right to be heard

is a relevant procedural rule within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d).°° The Committee

agrees with the Parties on this issue.

The second issue is the consideration of whether there has been a departure from the rule

of procedure concerned. In the context of the right to be heard, the Committee understands

The Committee is mindful of the fact that the English and French versions of Article 52(1)(d) refer to a

” rule of dure and a régle “fond ” dey . while the Spanish one refers simply
to a norma de procedimiento (without qualifying the importance of this rule), As the three versions are equally
authentic, and pursuant to the relevant customary rule of treaty interpretation they are presumed to have the same
meaning in each authentic language, the Committee is proceeding on the assumption that the three versions reflect
the same meaning.

that “the right [of a party] to state its claim or its defense and to produce all arguments and

297

evidence in support of it””’, and the provision of a “full and fair opportunity to be heard at

every stage of the proceedings” and an “ample opportunity to consider and present written

and oral submissions on the issues”?®

constitute basic features that define the right to be
heard in an arbitral proceeding. In the Committee’s view, any deviation from those
fundamental procedural guarantees would qualify as a “departure” for purposes of

Article 52(1)(d).

The third issue to be addressed is whether the challenged procedural departure qualifies as
“serious”. As pointed out by the Claimant, there is some variance in the jurisprudence on
what this entails. This seriousness may be measured in terms of the material impact on the
outcome of the arbitral decision” - in the sense of examining the extent to which the proper
application of the procedural rule “could potentially have affected the award”.'° However,
the seriousness of a procedural departure has also been examined on the basis of the extent
to which the departure may have “deprive[d] a party of the benefit or protection which the

rule was intended to provide”.'°!

The Committee notes that the Claimant has not refuted Spain’s argument that it is not
obliged to demonstrate that the result of the arbitration would have been different if the
violated rule of procedure had been respected. The Committee accepts Spain’s argument
as it is unrealistic to require a party to prove that the outcome of the Award would differ,
and further notes that Spain’s argument is supported by the Pey Casado decision where the
committee held that “[t]he applicant is not required to show that the result would have

been different, that it would have won the case, if the rule had been respected”!

The Committee understands that there may be multiple situations in which allegations of a

serious departure from the obligation to provide and ensure the right to be heard may arise

in an arbitral proceeding, including circumstances relating to the production and treatment
of documents and evidence, and the opportunity that is afforded to the parties to present

their case or their defense. !°°

The Committee disagrees with the Claimant’s argument that Spain has misrepresented the
standard of review pertaining to document requests. Contrary to the Claimant’s
submissions,'°* Spain does not go so far as to claim that it has a right to be granted all
document requests. It is clear to the Committee that Spain was merely arguing that a refusal
of a request of document production, where unjustified, can constitute a violation of the
right to be heard. In the Committee’s view, the assessment of whether such a right has been

violated is inevitably a very fact specific exercise. !°°

JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW

In relation to jurisdiction and applicable law, Spain submits that the Award should be
annulled on the grounds that: (i) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by asserting
jurisdiction over a dispute between a Member State from the European Union (“EU”) and
investors from another member state (i.e. an intra~-EU dispute) and interpreted Article 26
of the ECT contrary to EU law;! (ii) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by
failing to apply EU law (in particular EU law on state aid) to the merits of the case;'°’ and
(iii) the Award failed to state the reasons for not considering EU law as part of the

applicable law.'°* The Committee proceeds to address each of these issues in turn.

A. ‘WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL MANIFESTLY EXCEEDED ITS POWERS BY ASSERTING
ITS JURISDICTION

ji Spain’s Position

Spain submits that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers because it did not apply

EU law (which led, in turn, to the erroneous assertion of its jurisdiction).!° In support of

the argument that EU law ought to apply, Spain relies primarily on the “principle of

7110 and the Achmea Judgment,!!! and also makes reference to EU law

primacy of EU law’
being “international law” that falls under the scope of Article 26(6) of the ECT.!!
Separately, Spain also argues that on “the understanding that EU law is applicable to the
dispute”,''> the literal text, object and purpose of the ECT confirm that the dispute
settlement provision of the ECT, i.e. Article 26,'!4 was not intended to cover intra-EU
disputes.''> Accordingly, Spain requests the Committee to determine whether the Tribunal

asserted jurisdiction beyond what it was entitled to under the applicable rules.!!°

Spain first argues that EU law should apply to the dispute in light of the “principle of
primacy” of EU law.!'!7 In Spain’s submission, this principle gives preference to EU law
in the event of a conflict between the rules of a Member State and EU law, and also applies
to the “rules that Member States endow themselves through international agreements or
treaties, that is, it applies in the context of Public International Law”.!'* Spain argues'!?
that this principle of primacy is evidenced by: (i) Article 267 of the TFEU which, according

to Spain, provides that the highest judicial instance of each Member State may submit

preliminary ruling procedure questions on EU law to the CJEU;!° and (ii) Article 344 of
the TFEU which prohibits Member States from submitting a dispute that affects the
interpretation or application of EU Treaties to a method of dispute resolution other than

their national courts. '2!

Spain claims that in the event of a conflict between the ECT and EU law, the conflict will
have to be resolved in accordance with the principle of primacy of EU law.'?? However, it
contends that in this case the Tribunal ignored the specific rules of conflict contained in
EU law and instead relied on a “biased” '?? interpretation of Article 16 when it concluded

that:

“[...] under Article 16 of the ECT, a provision of another treaty can
only operate as the rule of decision that supplants the investment
protection provisions of Part III of the ECT if that other treaty provides
substantive protections that are more favorable to investors than are
the investment protection provisions of Part III of the ECT. Claimant
has not invoked any such provision in an EU treaty, nor does the
Tribunal find one to exist”.!*4

According to Spain, “Article 16 of the ECT is not a conflict resolution rule but an
interpretative precept”.'”* In Spain’s submission, if a conflict was deemed to exist between
the ECT and EU law, it should have been resolved by application of Article 30 of the

Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “VCLT”), '° under which the primacy of

EU law would still prevail as /ex posterior given that this principle “was codified in

Declaration 17 annexed to the Lisbon Treaty, signed in 2007”.'?7

In the same vein, Spain contends that the Tribunal was “wrong to reach [the]

conclusion’ 8

that the Achmea Judgment (which is based on inter alia the effects of
Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU)'” did not apply to the dispute. In the Achmea Judgment,
the CJEU was asked to make a preliminary ruling on whether an arbitration clause in the

Slovakia-Netherlands BIT was compatible with the TFEU, and concluded that:

“Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a
provision in an international agreement concluded between Member
States, such as Article 8 of the BIT, under which an investor from one
of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning
investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the

latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that

Member State has undertaken to accept”.'*°

In Spain’s submission, the Achmea Judgment is directly applicable to the case at hand as
the Tribunal was called upon to apply EU law and the Award is not subject to review by
the EU judicial system.'*! Spain argues that the findings in Achmea are “fully extrapolable”
to the present case and if they had been properly analysed by the Tribunal, “it would have
found it necessary to apply EU law to the merits of the dispute, thereby demonstrating its

lack of jurisdiction” .'°?

Additionally, in support of its argument that EU law is applicable to the issue of jurisdiction
as well as the merits of the dispute,'*? Spain makes reference to Article 26(6) of the ECT
which states that: “[a] tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in

dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international

law”.'*4 Relying on its expert, Prof. Gosalbo, Spain argues that EU law (as international

law) should be applied in the present case.'*> Spain claims that Article 26(6) incorporates

the principle of “iura novit curia’” into the ECT, directing the Tribunal to determine and

specify the international standard applicable to the procedure for resolving not only the

issues on the merits, but all “the issues in dispute”, thus including the issues of jurisdiction,

merits and quantum. '*°

On the understanding that EU law is applicable to the dispute, Spain argues that the literal

text, object and purpose of the ECT confirm that Article 26 of the ECT cannot confer

jurisdiction on an arbitral tribunal to hear an intra-EU dispute:!>”

(a)

(b)

First, Spain objects to the Tribunal’s conclusion that the literal wording of the ECT
does not establish a differentiated treaty for EU Member States. Spain argues that
this distinction has been made by Member States which have signed a series of
treaties that make up EU law and that prevail over the ECT in accordance with the
principle of primacy. '** Spain further submits that a literal interpretation of the ECT
itself, including the proper consideration of notions such as “Regional Economic
Integration Organization” (“REIO”), “Area” and “Contracting Party”, also
supports the exclusion of intra-EU disputes from the scope of Article 26 as there is
no diversity between the “Area” in which the investment is made and the

25 and 36 of the ECT support this literal interpretation. '*°

Member States themselves — shows that EU Member States did not, and could not,

consent to submit intra-EU disputes to arbitration. '*!

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

Asa general point, the Claimant stresses that an annulment proceeding is not an appeal and
that Spain’s disagreement with the Tribunal’s conclusions on the relevance of EU law are

. ' a ae. 2
not a valid ground for annulment on the basis of a manifest excess of powers. !”

According
to the Claimant, Spain is seeking to reargue the dispute, which is contrary to what an ICSID
annulment proceeding is concerned with.'4? The Claimant emphasizes that a claim in an
annulment proceeding that there was no proper application of the law must be based on a
failure “of such nature or degree as to constitute objectively [...] its effective non-
application” .+ The Claimant submits that, given the applicable standard for the manifest
excess of powers, it is under no obligation to address Spain’s theories on EU law, nor

should the Committee feel obliged to do so.'45

The Claimant notes that, while Spain has invoked the principle of primacy of EU law as
the basis for its challenge,'*° this principle was originally developed to resolve internal
conflicts between EU law and national laws and “does not extend [...] to other agreements,
signed with non-EU Member States or multilateral agreements such as the ECT”.'*” The
Claimant further argues that the implications of Spain’s arguments based on the Achmea
Judgment are unacceptable from the perspective of public international law. According to
the Claimant, accepting Spain’s argument would result in EU law applying to disputes
under the ECT involving non-EU investors in which the host State is an EU Member. '*8
The Claimant further argues that the Achmea Judgment is irrelevant because: (i) the ECT

includes no reference to the national law of the host state, contrary to the BIT at issue in

the Achmea Judgment; and (ii) the ECT is a multilateral treaty that includes amongst its
signatories, non-EU Member States and the EU itself, with no exception for intra~EU

disputes. '4°

The Claimant further submits that the Tribunal gave consideration to EU law, and applied
the choice made by the Parties, i.e. the ECT.'* According to the Claimant, the Tribunal
interpreted Article 26(6) of the ECT as not excluding EU treaties from “potential sources”
of the applicable law, while acknowledging that Article 16 does not permit derogations
from the ECT investor protections if these provisions are more favourable to the investor
than those of other international agreements.!*! The Tribunal properly applied Article 16
of the ECT,'* and could not find that there was an EU treaty provision more favourable to

the investor, and therefore it could not derogate from the ECT.'**

(iii) |The Committee’s Analysis
It is useful to first set out a brief summary of the Tribunal’s findings on jurisdiction before

turning to the Committee’s analysis of the arguments raised by the Parties in this regard.

In summary:

(a) The Tribunal divided its analysis on the issue of jurisdiction into two questions in
the light of the preliminary objections raised by Spain in the arbitral proceedings:
(i) “[t]he Contention that the ECT Contains an Implied Exception for ‘Intra-EU
disputes”'** and (ii) “[t]he Claim that the TFEU Excludes the Tribunal’s

Jurisdiction, Taking into Account Achmea v. Slovakia” .'°°

(b) In respect of the first question, the Tribunal interpreted the ECT “in accordance

with the ordinary meaning of its terms, in their context and in light of the object

and purpose of the treaty”,!°° before concluding that “that there is no implied

exception to the ECT that excludes intra-EU investments and intra-EU disputes
from the Treaty”.'°7 Amongst other things, the Tribunal rejected Spain’s argument
that Article 26(1) of the ECT requires a diversity of nationality and “Area” in the
context of a REIO, like the EU (of which both Germany and Spain are Member

States). !58

As for the second question, the Tribunal answered this by considering three specific
sub-questions: (i) whether Article 344 of the TFEU addresses the same subject
matter as Article 26 of the ECT; if so (ii) whether there is an inconsistency between
the two treaties; and if so (iii) whether the TFEU or the ECT prevails in a conflict
situation.'*° The Tribunal considered, inter alia, the CJEU’s judgment in Achmea
that Article 3 of the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT was inconsistent with the TFEU and
that Articles 267 and 244 of the TFEU had primacy over the BIT, before proceeding

on the basis that the first two sub-questions were answered in the affirmative.

To answer the third sub-question, the Tribunal considered that Article 16 of the
ECT “expressly addresses the relationship between the dispute settlement chapter
of the ECT and the provisions of another treaty on that subject matter [...] in clear
terms and comprehensive terms”.'® Applying Article 16 of the ECT, the Tribunal
found that the TFEU would prevail over the ECT “only if the provisions of the
TFEU are more favourable to the Investor than is Part V of the ECT”.'°! However,
in the Tribunal’s view, the TFEU was not “more favourable” than the ECT because

the ECT “adds the mechanism of investor-State dispute settlement to the

mechanisms that would otherwise be available to an investor”, and thus could not

derogate from the ECT.'”

The Committee addresses this ground of annulment on the basis of the arguments put
forward by the Parties and the Tribunal’s findings as reflected in the Award. As set out
above, Spain’s case is essentially that, in interpreting Article 26 of the ECT, the Tribunal
did not apply or alternatively misinterpreted EU law.'© The Committee understands that
Spain’s argument is premised on the notion that a proper reading of Article 26 must
contemplate the implications derived from EU law, as reflected in the Achmea Judgment
(among other documents), and should have led the Tribunal to conclude that Article 26 of

the ECT was inapplicable to this intra-EU dispute.'™

At the outset, the Committee reiterates that in order to justify annulment on the ground that
there has been a manifest excess of power, the excess of power must be discernable from
a plain reading of the award and perceived or recognized as such by an annulment
committee without difficulty. The Committee notes that this claim of manifest excess of
power encompasses an alleged misapplication or misinterpretation of the applicable law
in respect of the establishment of jurisdiction in the dispute. As noted above, in this type
of situation, the threshold for finding an annullable error of law must be very high and
should require the finding of an erroneous interpretation or misapplication of the law “so

gross or egregious as substantially to amount to failure to apply the proper law”.

Spain argues that Article 26 was not properly interpreted because no relevant consideration
was given to EU law, in particular the Achmea Judgment and the principle of primacy of
EU law in the case of a conflict of laws. However, the Committee is not persuaded that an

excess of power is discernible without difficulty from a plain reading of the Award.

In addressing this matter, the Committee refers to the section in the Award in which the
Tribunal dealt with the question of whether its jurisdiction could be excluded by virtue of

the TFEU.

As a starting point, the Committee notes that the Tribunal was aware of the issue, and stated
the relevant question: “whether the TFEU operates to change the meaning or validity of
the ECT for those ECT Contracting Parties that are also EU Member States.”'°° The
Tribunal then proceeded to examine whether the scope of Article 344 of the TFEU affects
the scope of Article 26 of the ECT — in the sense of determining whether the two provisions

address the same subject matter.

The Tribunal noted that the CJEU in Achmea had found that an investor-State arbitration
clause in a BIT between two EU Member States was inconsistent with the TFEU.'°’ The
Tribunal considered it “prudent to proceed, arguendo on the assumption that a provision
of a non-EU treaty in which treaty parties agree to investor-State dispute settlement does
fall within the scope of Article 344 of the TFEU, even if the investment treaty is a
multilateral treaty to which the EU itself is a party, such as the ECT’. With this assumption,
the Tribunal concluded that “it would follow from the reasoning in Achmea that the consent
of EU Member States to investor-State arbitration pursuant to Article 26 of the ECT is in
conflict with Article 344 of the TFEU, as the TFEU has been interpreted by the CJEU”.'°
On this basis, the Tribunal concluded that it must therefore determine which treaty takes

precedence.

Up to this point, the Committee cannot identify any argument from Spain showing a gross
error in the manner in which the Tribunal approached its interpretation of Article 26 of the

ECT in the light of EU law and the Achmea Judgment.

The Tribunal then faced the question of which treaty — the ECT or the TFEU — should
prevail in that presumed situation of conflict. To resolve it, the Tribunal considered the

possibility of resorting to the general customary rules on treaty law as reflected in

'66 Award, 4238.
‘61 Award, 4243.
168 Award, 4245.

38

122.

Article 30 of the VCLT.'®? However, the Tribunal identified a provision in the ECT that it
considered it more specific to address the issue, i.e. Article 16 of the ECT. The Committee
notes that this provision has the title “Relation [of the ECT] to other Agreements”. The
Tribunal stated that “Article 16 of the ECT expressly addresses the relationship between
the dispute settlement chapter of the ECT and the provisions of another treaty on that
subject matter [...] in clear terms and comprehensive terms”.‘”° It is clear to the Committee
that the Tribunal took into consideration the findings in the Achmea Judgment, but simply
reached a different conclusion on whether the TFEU ought to prevail over the other

investment agreement in question, which was the ECT in this case.

Spain questions the Tribunal’s resort to Article 16 because the Tribunal interpreted it in a
“biased”'"' manner which departs from the logical conclusion that any conflict that might
arise must be resolved according to the rules enshrining the principle of primacy,'” and
“Article 16 of the ECT is not a conflict resolution rule but an interpretative precept’ .'”
For the Committee, it is clear that Spain disagrees with the Tribunal’s resort to Article 16.
However, the Committee has not been able to find in Spain’s arguments any explanation
of why the Tribunal’s interpretation of Article 16 could be characterised as biased or
incorrect, let alone sufficiently “egregious” to justify annulment. Neither does the
Committee find an explanation of the distinction drawn between a “conflict resolution
rule” and an “interpretative precept’, and the reason why the Tribunal’s reliance on
Article 16 — although it is an alleged interpretative precept — would constitute an egregious
error. In fact, the Committee notes that in its arguments on the applicable law on the merits,
Spain has characterised Article 16 as a provision that would be applicable exclusively, if
what Spain intended was the non-application of the ECT.'* The Committee understands
this statement from Spain as suggesting that in certain contexts Article 16 may play the

function of a rule of conflict.

Spain also argues by relying on Article 16, that the Tribunal disregarded the special rule of
conflict provided in EU law, by which Spain means the principle of primacy of EU law.'”>
The Committee disagrees that this amounts to an annullable error of law. It is clear to the
Committee that the Tribunal considered that the conflict ought to be resolved by the special
tule in Article 16 of the ECT, as opposed to the principle of primacy of EU law or the more
general, “residual”, rules contained in Article 30 of the VCLT. The Tribunal’s view was
based on the understanding that Article 16 of the ECT expressly addresses the relationship
between the dispute settlement chapter of the ECT and the provisions of another treaty on
that subject matter!” in clear and comprehensive terms.'7? The Committee also
understands that the Tribunal considered Article 16 as a rule that prevails over any /ex
posterior or priori given that the Tribunal noted that “Article 16 of the ECT has a
comprehensive temporal scope; it applies both to treaties that are subsequent to the ECT

(such as the TFEU) and prior EU and European Community treaties” .'7°

In contrast, the Tribunal could not find support for Spain’s proposition that the principle of
EU primacy over non-EU treaties was “so obvious” as of the time of negotiation of the
ECT that there was no need for an express exclusion.'”? Against this background, the
Committee cannot find in Spain’s submissions any challenge to the Tribunal’s resort to
Article 16 that would demonstrate a severe or egregious error in the manner in which the

Tribunal interpreted and applied this provision.

Insofar as Spain argues that EU law is international law, which ought to be applied to the
question of jurisdiction pursuant to Article 26(6), the Committee notes that the Tribunal
considered Article 26(6) in the context of the other provisions of the ECT before it
concluded that the “issues in dispute” referred to in Article 26(6) only concerned the law

applicable to the merits, not jurisdiction.'*° While Spain asserts that “[n]owhere does

Article 26(6) of the ECT indicate that it should not apply to the question of jurisdiction” ,'*!

the Committee cannot find in Spain’s arguments any explanation on how the Tribunal’s
analysis regarding what constitutes an issue in dispute under Article 26(6) amounts to an
egregious error that justifies annulment. As such, the Committee does not consider it
necessary to address the Parties’ substantive arguments on whether EU law is
“international law” for the purposes of determining whether there was a manifest excess
of powers on the issue of jurisdiction. Instead, these arguments are addressed below in the
context of whether there was a manifest excess of powers regarding the determination of

the law applicable to the merits.

As for Spain’s criticisms in respect of the Tribunal’s interpretation of the ECT itself, the
Committee notes that Spain disagrees with the manner in which the Tribunal read the treaty
terms concerned, in particular the notions of “Area” and “REJO” under Article 1 of the
ECT. However, the Committee notes that, other than expressing divergent views, Spain
has not submitted any specific error of such a severe or “egregious” character in the
Tribunal’s interpretation of the terms of Articles 1 and 26 of the ECT so as to call into

question the effective application of the ECT.

For the Committee, the fact that the Tribunal allegedly relied on a simple textual
interpretation of relevant terms under the ECT is not an interpretative approach that may
be characterised in itself as constituting a gross error in the interpretation of a given treaty
provision. Rather, the Committee notes that a reading of the relevant section of the Award
shows that the Tribunal conducted a complex interpretative task, with various layers of
analysis, and certainly went beyond a simple reliance on the ordinary meaning of the terms

contained in the ECT.

Therefore, the Committee has not been able to identify a gross or egregious error in the
Tribunal’s interpretation and application of Article 26 and other related provisions of the

ECT in the establishment of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction pursuant to the ECT. Accordingly,

Reply on Annulment, 87.

the Committee considers that the Tribunal did not exceed its powers within the meaning of

Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.

B. ‘WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL MANIFESTLY EXCEEDED ITS POWERS BY DECIDING
NOT TO APPLY EU LAW TO THE MERITS OF THE CASE

ji Spain’s Position

Spain contends that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by identifying incorrectly

the applicable law and refusing to apply EU law, in particular the provisions of the TFEU

on state aid and other EU derivative rules (including European Commission’s directives

and decisions) for purposes of examining the merits of the dispute.'** In the alternative,

Spain submits that the Tribunal incurred a gross misapplication of EU law.!*

Spain claims that the Tribunal dispensed with the “triple nature” of EU law (as
international law, domestic law, and as fact) and considered only the question of whether
EU law offers “applicable rules and principles of International Law” pursuant to Article
26(6) of the ECT.'*4 In Spain’s submission, while the Tribunal recognised that EU treaties
could be “potential sources of ‘applicable rules and principles of international law”, it
nevertheless discarded their applicability to an intra-EU dispute. '** According to Spain, it
had taken the position that “together with the rules contained in the ECT itself, the
reference in Article 26 (6) of the ECT to ‘applicable rules and principles of international
law’ should lead to the application, also, of the European Union law”'®® (emphasis in
original). However, the Tribunal failed to examine whether the ECT and EU law could not
be interpreted in an integrated manner.'*’ Instead, it misconstrued Spain’s position and

applied Article 16 of the ECT, which would only have been relevant if Spain had sought

the “non-application of the ECT”’.'** On this basis, Spain argues that the Tribunal

incorrectly identified the applicable law and manifestly erred in interpreting it.'*°

Apart from the “error of assuming that [EU law], if applied, would automatically exclude
the ECT”,!° Spain criticizes the Tribunal for only entertaining the possibility that EU
treaties could be “Applicable International Law” under Article 26(6) of the ECT, and
ignoring the other rules of EU law invoked by Spain.!*! Furthermore, Spain argues that the
Tribunal incorrectly addressed the question of primacy of EU law (over other international
law) and failed to explain why the rules in respect of state aid found in Articles 107 and
108 of the TFEU should be ignored!” even though the European Commission’s Decision
on Spain’s regulations in support of renewable energies (“2017 EC Decision”) concludes
that the subsidies granted are “State Aid” subject to the corresponding regulations (i.e.

Articles 107 and 108 of the TFEU).!*>

In its Reply, Spain further asserts that the Award violated all sources of international law.'**
Treaty law (as reflected in the TFEU and other EU treaties), customary rules (consisting of
a recognised, permanent and consistent practice of respect of autonomy and primacy of EU
law over any other rules) and the general principles of law (in particular pacta sunt
servanda with respect to the observance of the EU rules on state aid) imposed on the

Tribunal the obligation to accord primacy to EU law over the ECT.!°>

Next, Spain argues that the Tribunal did not address the “factual aspect” of Spain’s
arguments on EU law when it analysed the Claimant’s legitimate expectations.'*°

According to Spain, the Tribunal contradicted itself by stating that the EU rules on state

aid were essential to assess the expectations of the investor while dismissing any analysis

of the state aid provisions and its applicability to the case. !°”

In Spain’s submission, the fact that the 2017 EC Decision was rejected merely because “it
is later in time than when the measures in dispute were enacted” highlights the Tribunal’s
failure to conduct a correct analysis of the content of this decision, which is essential for a
proper understanding of the investor’s legitimate expectations. !°* Had the Tribunal applied
EU law to the dispute, it would have had to consider whether Royal Decree 661/2007 and
Royal Decree 1578/2008 were notified to the European Commission and the implication

of the non-notification on the investor’s legitimate expectations.!”

With regard to Spain’s alternative argument that the Tribunal misapplied EU law, it claims
that the Tribunal completely ignored the 2017 EC Decision?” and “the Award makes an
interpretation directly contrary to EU law (disregarding it both as law and as fact) when
it omits to analyse the primacy of Community law over the ECT, without even analysing its

relevance to the issues in dispute”.?!

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

According to the Claimant, the Tribunal considered EU law to the limited extent that it was
relevant to the Parties’ dispute (through the prism of the ECT), and made no error in
applying the proper law.”°? Accordingly, the Claimant submits that Spain fails to establish
the “exceptional circumstances” under which a misapplication of law can be a ground for

annulment.2%

According to the Claimant, Spain’s challenge to the Tribunal’s position on the applicable

law rests on the same basis as the jurisdictional argument, i.e. the principle of primacy of

EU law.?*4 The Claimant submits that if Spain’s arguments are accepted, any investment
case which (according to EU law) raises issues of state aid is a case in which EU law must
be applied, thus resulting in EU Member States’ international obligations under the ECT

being systematically overridden.?°°

According to the Claimant, the Tribunal turned to the ECT as the Parties’ only express
choice of law, to determine the law applicable to the merits of the dispute. The Tribunal
accepted Spain’s argument that EU law formed part of international law, but still
considered the ECT as the primary applicable law.”°° In the Tribunal’s view, pursuant to
Article 16, the provisions of another treaty could only be envisaged if they provide
substantive protections that are more favourable to the investor than the investment
protection provisions of the ECT. Applying this, the Tribunal found that the provisions of
EU treaties, in particular Articles 107 and 108 of the TFEU, did not afford better protection
to the Claimant than the ECT, and were thus not applicable to the dispute.?°”

In response to Spain’s argument that both the ECT and EU law should apply to this dispute
in an integrated manner, the Claimant argues this argument was already rejected by the
Tribunal in accordance with the Parties’ choice of law as determined by the Tribunal.?°*
The Claimant further argues that Spain does not rely on a binding proposition of law in

support of this argument.

With regard to Spain’s arguments on the primacy of EU law, the Claimant argues that there

was no reason to apply the principle of primacy of EU law, or any rule of EU law, because

the Tribunal was not a European institution or court.?!°

As for Spain’s assertion that the Award is “in violation of all sources of international law”,
the Claimant argues that this is new and completely irrelevant.”!! According to the
Claimant, Spain only cites sources of EU law focusing on the TFEU and EU state aid
provisions in support of this argument.?'? In the Claimant’s submission, Spain does not
explain how the fact that the EU has a legal system in the area concerned has an impact on
the ECT’s interpretation,”'> or how the principle of pacta sunt servanda imposes a duty on
the Tribunal or the Committee to enforce the rules on EU state aid in the context of the

ICSID dispute.?!+

As regards the 2017 EC Decision, the Claimant argues that the Tribunal did not ignore this
decision as Spain claims, but simply considered that the decision did not include
protections that were more favourable than the provisions in the ECT, and thus could not
apply to the dispute pursuant to Article 16 of the ECT.7!> As for the “factual aspect” of
Spain’s argument, the Claimant argues that the Tribunal dismissed the relevance of the
decision on the establishment of legitimate expectations because it “could not have
operated as law governing [Spain]’s imposition of the Disputed Measures [...] in 2010-
2013”.?'° In the Claimant’s submission, the Tribunal gave the appropriate weight to the
2017 EC Decision and Spain cannot argue now that “/t/he Award does not consider this

issue”.?'7

Regarding Spain’s alternative argument on the alleged “misapplication” of EU law, the
Claimant submits that this is merely a combination of Spain’s arguments on the Tribunal’s
reasons regarding the Claimant’s legitimate expectations and the concept of primacy of EU

law.!* The Claimant reiterates that the Tribunal’s reasoning was clear, and that Spain has

avoided any attempt to explain how a 2017 document could be relevant to investors’

legitimate expectations in 2010-2013.7!°

(iii) |The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee proceeds to assess whether the Tribunal exceeded its powers by deciding
not to accept EU law as part of the applicable law, and in particular TFEU Articles 107 and
108 and the 2017 EC Decision. The Committee’s analysis is based on the arguments that
the Parties put forward and the findings that the Tribunal made in its Award. The
Committee understands Spain’s claim at issue as focused on the alleged failure by the
Tribunal to apply the applicable law (or part of it). Spain does not contest the fact that the

ECT is applicable law, but argues that it had to be applied jointly7”°

and interpreted in an
integrated manner with EU law.”?! The Claimant also notes that the Tribunal considered

the ECT as the primary applicable law.???

The question before this Committee is therefore whether the Tribunal acted within its
powers in concluding that “EU law is not part of the law applicable in this case”?
Article 26(6) of the ECT states that “[a] tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall
decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and
principles of international law”. For the Committee, it is undisputed that the ECT is part
of the applicable law in the dispute. The question is whether the Tribunal exceeded its
authority by interpreting the remaining terms of Article 26(6), i.e. “applicable rules and
principles of international law”, as not including EU law. The Committee understands that
it should examine whether the Tribunal made a gross or egregious misinterpretation of the
terms “applicable rules and principles of international law” in Article 26(6) of the ECT so
as to deny applicability to a set of rules (EU law on state aid) that were otherwise applicable

in this dispute.

146. |The Committee notes that the Tribunal was mindful of the interpretative task at issue.?*+ It

was also mindful of the distinction made by Spain on the “triple” nature of EU law. In that
respect, it noted that the ECT “does not identify domestic law as a source of applicable
law”. Therefore, the Tribunal decided to set aside the invocation of EU as domestic law or
as fact.??> The Tribunal then found that EU treaties are clearly “treaties” and “agreements”
under the VCLT. Accordingly, the Tribunal considered that “EU treaties cannot be
excluded as potential sources of ‘applicable rules and principles of international law’

within the meaning of ECT Article 26(6)”.?°

147. However, it is important to emphasize that the Tribunal merely identified EU treaties as
potential sources of international law. Contrary to Spain’s allegations, the Tribunal did not
conclude at that stage that those treaties were necessarily part of the applicable international
law to the dispute for purposes of Article 26(6). It must be noted that the Tribunal had
already expressed its view that “treaties other than the ECT could also play a role as
applicable law in a variety of ways”, and that “there are circumstances in which the
provisions of a treaty other than the ECT could have an impact on the substantive law to
be applied in a dispute in which a breach of Part III of the ECT is alleged and thus can
play a role as applicable law”.>’ Thus, the Tribunal had envisaged that not in all
circumstances would an international agreement (other than ECT) qualify as part of the
applicable law. As a clear example of this possibility, the Tribunal cited Article 16 of the
ECT, “pursuant to which the substantive protections of another ‘international agreement’
cannot derogate from the investor protections contained in Part III of the ECT if the
provisions of the ECT are more favorable to the Investor or the Investment than are the
provisions of the other international agreement’.”* In having proceeded this way, the

Committee does not find in the Tribunal’s conduct an egregious interpretation or severe

error in the application of Article 26(6) of the ECT, such that would amount to a failure to

apply the proper law.

The Tribunal then faced the duty of resolving the question of applicability of EU law in the
context of having considered itself bound to decide the dispute in accordance with the
ECT.” The Tribunal resorted to Article 16 of the ECT which is entitled “Relation [of the
ECT] to other Agreements”. The Tribunal followed the wording of Article 16 and found
that the provision of another treaty can “only operate as the rule of decision that supplants
the investment protection provisions of Part III of the ECT if that other treaty provides
substantive protections that are more favorable to investors than are the investment
protection provisions of Part III of the ECT’. Based on this legal standard, the Tribunal
exercised its function as the trier of facts of the case. It found that no such (more favourable)
provision in an EU treaty was invoked by Spain or was found by the Tribunal in the course
of the arbitration process. Similarly, while it made no finding that derivative EU
instruments or the 2017 EC Decision may qualify as “international law”, it found arguendo
that no provision in that decision was identified in the arbitration as more favourable to the

protections afforded by Part III of the ECT.?°°

Spain submits that before concluding that EU law was not part of the applicable law, the
Tribunal was required to examine why an integrated interpretation of both the ECT and EU
law was not possible.”*! However, the Committee does not see how the absence of an
explanation on the manner in which the Tribunal tried to reconcile the application of the
ECT and the EU treaties may be regarded as a manifest excess of powers. This is
particularly so given the context in which the discussion arose, with Spain arguing that the
TFEU prevails over any other rules*”, in particular the ECT.?** That context did not lend
itself for the Tribunal to follow the alternative explanatory approach that Spain suggests in

this annulment proceeding.

150. Turning to Spain’s argument that the Award violated all sources of international law, the
Committee notes first that this line of argument is not reflected in the Award summary of
Spain’s position before the Tribunal.?*+ Neither has the Committee been able to find it in
Spain’s submissions in the Underlying Arbitration.?*> Based on the content of Spain’s
arguments on this issue, the Committee understands that this is a further expression of
Spain’s position that EU law prevails over any other set of international rules because of

the principle of primacy of EU law.

151. The Committee notes that Spain’s claim is based on the alleged support for the principle
of primacy of EU law by various sources of international law. However, the claim is not
based on the existence of an egregious error of interpretation or gross misapplication of the
ECT. The challenge seems to pursue the effective non-application of the ECT (at least as
far as Article 16 is concerned). As such, that approach seems to be difficult to reconcile
with the mandate of ECT Article 26(6), according to which, the Tribunal had to “decide
the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty”. Thus, in addressing the alleged
manifest excess of power arising from the non-application of EU law, Spain’s approach
would paradoxically lead to the accrual of another potential manifest excess of power

arising from the failure to apply the ECT, in particular Article 16.

152. As for Spain’s argument that the Tribunal disregarded the applicability of TFEU
Articles 107 and 108, the Committee understands that the Tribunal’s considerations, as
they relate to EU treaties generally, apply necessarily to particular provisions such as
Articles 107 and 108 of the TFEU. The Committee has found no gross error concerning
the Tribunal’s application of Articles 16 and 26(6) of the ECT with respect to the
applicability of EU treaties. Consequently, no gross error can either be found concerning
the Tribunal’s application of the said provisions of the ECT with respect to the more

specific EU treaty provisions of TFEU Articles 107 and 108.

153. With respect to Spain’s arguments relating to the dismissal of the 2017 EC Decision, the
Committee notes that Spain’s concern seems to be more related to the Tribunal’s
establishment of the facts, rather than the determination of the applicable law on the basis
of which those facts were judged. The Committee further observes that, regardless of the
“binding” or “international law” character that the Tribunal assigned (or not) to the 2017
EC Decision, the Tribunal found that no more favourable provision was identified in that
decision (as compared to Part III of the ECT). Thus, the Tribunal found no basis to consider
itself required to admit the decision as applicable law. It further noted, as a matter of fact,
that even if the decision was “binding” upon Spain, it “could not have operated as law
governing [Spain’s] imposition of the Disputed Measures [...] in 2010-2013”.?6 The
Committee does not find an egregious error in the manner in which the Tribunal applied

Article 26(6) in respect of the 2017 EC Decision.

154. As stated earlier, in order for a misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law to be
a manifest excess of powers it would need of such a gross or egregious nature as to amount
to a failure to apply the proper law. Based on the foregoing, the Committee has not been
able to identify such a gross or egregious error in the Tribunal’s interpretation and
application of Articles 16 and 26 of the ECT in the determination of the applicable law to
decide the issues in dispute. Accordingly, the Committee considers that the Tribunal did

not exceed its powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.

Cc. ‘WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL FAILED TO STATE ITS REASONS WHEN DECIDING THAT
EU LAW IS NOT PART OF THE APPLICABLE LAW
ji Spain’s Position
155. Spain submits that the Award must be annulled because it fails to state the reasons why: (i)
Articles 107 and 108 of the TFEU were not applied to the merits;”*’ and (ii) the reasoning

of the 2017 EC Decision has not been assessed.”**

156. On the first issue, Spain argues that despite its strong insistence during the proceedings that
there was a need to consider the regulations on state aid (i.e. Articles 107 and 108 of the
TFEU), the Tribunal did not explain why these provisions — which were deemed as
“applicable rules and principles of international law” by the Award itself — did not form
part of the applicable law.?*? According to Spain, the reference to Article 16 in the Award
merely refers to the 2017 EC Decision, but not to the provisions of the TFEU.”° In any
event, the reference to Article 16 constitutes frivolous reasoning because it mixes issues of
jurisdiction with those of applicable law.74! In addition, Spain submits that the alleged
reasoning is contradictory because, as noted above, it starts stating that EU treaties are
applicable law pursuant to Article 26(6), while ultimately refusing to apply TFEU Articles
107 and 108.747

157. On the second issue, Spain argues that the Award does not address the reasoning of the EC

in the 2017 EC Decision even though the relevance of this legal authority is “p/ausible”.?*
According to Spain, this document “studies in detail the impact of the regulations on State
Aid in the Spanish system of support for renewable energies - in a study that is also carried
out by the competent European institution exclusively set up to authorize State Aid”. In

its Reply, Spain further submits that the document is “essential” to understand the logic

of the measures at issue and some factual aspects of the dispute and was extensively
discussed by the Parties in the Underlying Arbitration. However, the Tribunal simply left

aside this document without providing any reason for having decided not to consider it.7*°

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the Tribunal provided clear reasoning for its decision on the
applicable law and Spain’s disagreement with that decision is not a ground for

annulment.247

On the first issue regarding the TFEU, the Claimant argues that the Tribunal’s reasoning
on the exclusion of EU law was clear and Spain cannot reasonably assert that the Tribunal
recognised EU treaties as potential sources of international law and then “departed —
without explaining why — from that conclusion”.*** In the Claimant’s submission, Article
16 of the ECT provides that EU treaty provisions can apply only if they offer more
favourable protection to the investor than the ECT provisions.”*? Neither the investor nor
the Tribunal itself — after examining the provision of the EU law — found any EU law
provision providing more favourable protection than that offered by the ECT. The Tribunal

thus explained expressly why EU treaty provisions could not apply to the dispute.7°

As the Tribunal had rejected the premise that EU law applies to the dispute, the Claimant
submits that it need not look further into TFEU Articles 107 and 108.7*! The Claimant
submits that because EU state aid rules are necessarily an element of EU treaties, the
Tribunal had provided its reasons for deciding that the EU state aid rules contained in
Articles 107 and 108 TFEU when it set out its conclusions pursuant to Article 16 of the
ECT that EU treaties could not derogate from the ECT since they were not more favourable

than the provisions of the ECT.?>

On the second issue regarding to the 2017 EC Decision, the Claimant argues that this
document was considered by the Tribunal, but was found to be irrelevant because it “could
not have operated as law governing [the] imposition of the Disputed Measures [...] in

2010-2013”?

The Claimant contends that the Tribunal’s reasoning was not “frivolous” or
“contradictory” as Spain alleges.7** Regarding the allegation of frivolousness, the
Claimant submits that the Tribunal devoted distinct sections to its analysis of the
applicability of EU law to the merits and to jurisdiction.**° With respect to the allegation
of contradiction, the Claimant argues that the status of EU treaties was not dispositive of
the issue, and the Tribunal rejected the application of EU law based on the Parties’ choice

of law under the ECT.?°6

(iii) |The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee understands that Spain’s ground for annulment does not relate to a decision
for which there is a complete absence of reasons. Rather, Spain’s case is based on the
allegation of a reasoning that cannot be followed,”°’ with gaps,”°* contradictory points”?

and “frivolous” or insufficient reasons.?

At the outset, the Committee notes that the relevant conclusion by the Tribunal is that “the
applicable law in this case is the Energy Charter Treaty, interpreted pursuant to the law
of treaties and supplemented by the customary international law of State responsibility.
For the reasons stated in the preceding paragraphs, EU law is not part of the law

applicable in this case”.*®' This conclusion is stated in the Award at the end of the sub-

263,

On its face, the Committee finds it difficult to consider that the Tribunal’s conclusion
cannot be followed through this sequence of steps, from the definition of the issue, through
the assessment of the applicability of EU law, up to the final conclusion. Insofar as Spain
makes the general assertion that the Award fails to provide reasons for disregarding EU
law,?° the Committee considers that the three paragraphs preceding the conclusion

(paragraphs 164, 165 and 166) provide those reasons.

Specifically, with regard to the alleged lack of reasons regarding Articles 107 and 108 of
the TFEU, the Committee is of the view that the reasoning stated in the relevant paragraphs,
which relate generally to “EU treaties”, apply specifically to TFEU Articles 107 and 108.
Similarly, it is clear that the reason that prevented the Tribunal from applying EU law was
the absence of an identified provision in an EU treaty, which under the Tribunal’s reading
of Article 16 of the ECT, provided protections to investors that are more favourable than

those provided in the ECT.

The Committee considers that the alleged contradiction raised by Spain is untenable. The
Tribunal’s characterization of EU treaties as “potential sources” of international law
accrues at the outset of the analysis, based on the undeniably international nature of EU
treaties. On the other hand, the statement that EU treaties are not part of the applicable law
in this case is the result of assessing those “potential sources” of international law through
the lenses of Article 16 of the ECT. Consequently, there is no contradiction that might
cancel out each of the statements of reasons, so as to be equivalent to a finding that no

reasons had been provided.

Furthermore, the Committee considers that the Tribunal’s reasoning on the basis of
Article 16 of the ECT was not frivolous as Spain claims. Article 16 states rules for the
application of Parts III and V of the ECT in relation to other international agreements. As
such, the provision is applicable for questions that may arise in the application of Part III
(including the determination of the applicable law) as well as Part V (including the

establishment of the tribunal’s jurisdiction). Accordingly, by resorting to Article 16 in the

Reply on Annulment, 4358.

171.

172.

173.

context of the discussion on the applicable law, the Committee understands that the

Tribunal did not mix the scope of those two different issues.

Similarly, the Committee considers that there is no absence of reasons with respect to the
treatment of the arguments put forward by Spain in relation to the Articles 107 and 108 of
the TFEU and the 2017 EC Decision. In the Committee’s view, the Tribunal’s decision not
to consider these instruments, or to express its views on them, is the result of its finding
that EU treaties provide no protection to investors more favourable than those of the ECT.
Therefore, the relevant EU treaties were not considered part of the applicable law, nor was
their secondary legislation. There was, hence, no room for further reasoning on the

relevance of the EU documents concerned.

Moreover, the Committee notes that with regard to the 2017 EC Decision, the Award
expressly states that even assuming that the 2017 EC was binding, it is irrelevant because
it “could not have operated as law governing [the] imposition of the Disputed Measures

[...] in 2010-2013” 26

For the reasons stated above, the Committee does not consider that the Award failed to
state reasons, within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, on the

determination of the applicable law in the case at hand.

THE TRIBUNAL’S ASSESSMENT OF LIABILITY

Before addressing the Parties’ arguments on whether the Tribunal’s assessment on liability
provides any basis for annulment, it is useful to first set out a brief summary of the

Tribunal’s findings in this regard.

In the Underlying Arbitration, the Claimant’s case arose out of regulatory changes
subsequent to Royal Decree 1578/2008 (collectively referred to as the “Disputed
Measures”), which the Claimant claimed violated inter alia Spain’s FET obligation under

Article 10(1) of the ECT. The Award refers to the laws and regulations up to and including

264 Counter-Memorial on Annulment, §]1 18; Rejoinder on Annulment, 4180.

57

Royal Decree 1578/2008 (“RD 1578/2008”) (which was in effect at the time of the

Claimant’s investment) as the “Original Regulatory Regime”.”

174. | The Award divides the Disputed Measures into two sets. The Tribunal found that Spain

was not liable for the “First Set of Disputed Measures” which comprised of:
(a) the TVPEE (which imposed a 7% tax on the value of energy production);

(b) Royal Decree Law 14/2010 (which introduced certain tolls and imposed a limit on

the equivalent hours of operation for photovoltaic plants) (“RD 14/2010”); and

(c) Royal Decree Law 2/2013 (which introduced a new CPI to update inflation
adjustments) (“RD 2/2013”).?

175. In particular, the Tribunal found that it did not have jurisdiction over the TVPEE. As for
RD 14/2010 and RD 2/2013, the Tribunal concluded that they “did not change the basic
features of the Original Regulatory Regime (the FIT [i.e. the feed-in tariff]) and did not
undermine Claimant’s legitimate expectation”,?*’ and thus, Spain’s adoption of these
measures was “not inconsistent with its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment
to Claimant’s investment” 2%

176. However, the Tribunal found that Spain violated its FET obligations by enacting the
“Second Set of Disputed Measures” (comprising Royal Decree Law 9/2013 (“RD
9/2013”), Law 24/2013, Royal Decree 413/2014, and the Ministerial Order
IET/1045/2014).?® With regard to these measures, the Tribunal found that they “changed
the basic features of the regulatory regime that was in place when Claimant made its
investment, exceeding the changes that Claimant could have reasonably anticipated at that

Turning to the proceedings at hand, Spain seeks to annul the Award on the ground that the
Tribunal failed to state reasons: (i) in respect of its application of Royal Decree 661/2007
(“RD 661/2007”); (ii) in respect of its findings relating to the Claimant’s legitimate
expectations; and (iii) because the reasoning in the Award is contradictory. The Committee

proceeds to address each of these issues in turn.

A. ‘WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL FAILED TO STATE ITS REASONS IN RESPECT OF ITS
APPLICATION OF RD 661/2007

ji Spain’s Position

Spain argues that it can be inferred from the Award that the Tribunal assumed that

RD 661/2007 “applied in its entirety’ to the Claimant’s investment, instead of

RD 1578/2008 which had replaced RD 661/2007 and was in force at the time of the

Claimant’s investment in 2010.77!

According to Spain, the Tribunal simply assumed, without further explanation, that the
alleged guarantees of RD 661/2007 could be transferred without further ado to an
investment under RD 1578/2008. Specifically, Spain takes issue with the Tribunal’s
reliance on: (i) a report of the Comisién Nacional de la Energia (the “CNE”) which
analyzed RD 661/2007; and (ii) the literal wording of RD 661/2007, in its analysis of the
Claimant’s expectations as of the date of its investment.” In Spain’s submission, the
Tribunal effectively “extracted an alleged stability commitment’ from RD 661/2007
(emphasis in the original).””

Spain also takes issue with the Tribunal’s findings in respect of the Fifth Additional
Provision of RD 1578/2008, entitled “Modification of the compensation for generation by
photovoltaic technology”. The Fifth Additional Provision stated: “During the year 2012,
based on the technological evolution of the sector and the market, and the functioning of

the compensatory regime, compensation for the generation of electric power by

182. Spain alleges that the Tribunal’s reasoning set out above is “not only scant, but wrong”.

photovoltaic solar technology may be modified’.>”* According to Spain, this provision

shows that “there could not be a legitimate expectation that the tariffs would be maintained

indefinitely” 77°

On this issue, the Tribunal concluded that:

“[g]iven that existing PV plants cannot benefit from technological
evolution, however, the Tribunal concludes that a prudent investor
operating under RD 1578/2008 could reasonably have understood the
Fifth Additional provision to contemplate ‘downward modification’
only for new plants. This conclusion is consistent with the position that
the CNE indicated in 2009, in response to an investor query. The
preamble of RD 1578/2008 does not detract from this understanding of
the Fifth Additional Provision”.?”°

29277

First, Spain argues that the reasoning is contradictory with the Tribunal’s conclusions that:
(i) the First Set of Disputed Measures did not violate the ECT; and (ii) that Spain’s
regulatory regime generally did not exclude the possibility that regulatory changes would
affect the Claimant’s investment.?”* Secondly, Spain argues that the Tribunal’s reasoning

is frivolous because, inter alia, it was made “without support in a single normative or

29279

expert opinion”*” and appears to be based on a CNE report in 2009 which was “improperly

introduced into the proceedings” .?°°

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the Tribunal ultimately considered the reduction of the

remuneration the Claimant legitimately expected under RD 1578/2008 (and not

R-0072-ENG, Royal Decree 1578/2008 of September 26, 2008, covering the compensation for the generation of
electric power by photovoltaic solar technology for facilities subsequent to the deadline for the maintenance of

RD 661/2007).**! According to the Claimant, the fact that the Tribunal analyzed
RD 661/2007 (the direct predecessor of RD 1578/2008) in order to understand the context
in which an investor formed its expectations with regard to RD 1578/2008 does not change

this essential fact.?*

The Claimant submits that the Tribunal amply provided its reasoning which led to its
conclusion that Spain violated its FET obligations by enacting the Second Set of Disputed
Measures.”** In particular, the Claimant claims that the Tribunal articulated its findings

regarding the relationship between RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 by stating that:

“Lw]hen Spain concluded that the policy set in RD 661/2007 had
generated more investment than had been expected, it made further
adjustments, first announcing that the FITs under RD 661/2007 would
not be available to new plants and later, in RD 1578/2008, reducing the
FITs that would apply to new plants. The reduced FITs for new plants
took advantage of technological advances and led to cost reductions
that would ultimately benefit consumers. At the same time, RD
1578/2008 increased the target for PV capacity”.?*4
According to the Claimant, this “/eaves no doubt” that the Tribunal premised its
conclusions on its finding that RD 1578/2008 constituted a downward modification (for

new installations only) relative to RD 661/2007.7*°

In response to Spain’s arguments on the Tribunal’s interpretation of the Fifth Additional
Provision of RD 1578/2008, the Claimant argues that the Tribunal concluded that a prudent
investor operating under RD 1578/2008 could reasonably have understood the Fifth
Additional provision to contemplate “downward modification” only for new plants in light
of the Tribunal’s finding that existing PV plants could not benefit from such technological
evolution.*° The Claimant also highlights that the Tribunal noted that its conclusion was

consistent with the position that the CNE had indicated in 2009 in response to an investor

query, and that it was further supported by numerous statements made by Spain and its

officials for the very purpose of attracting investments in renewable energy.*”

187. The Claimant contends that while Spain clearly still disagrees with the Tribunal’s
conclusion, this is not a ground for annulment. The Claimant takes the position that the
Tribunal addressed the Parties’ respective arguments and the evidence before it, and it
clearly stated its reasons for its conclusions. In the Claimant’s submission, that is

dispositive for the purposes of dismissing Spain’s annulment application.?**

(iii) |The Committee’s Analysis

188. The Committee is not persuaded that an inference ought to be drawn that the Tribunal
applied RD 661/2007 “in its entirety” instead of the regulation in force at the relevant time
(ie. RD 1578/2008). In its Memorial, Spain alleges that the Tribunal extracted a stability
commitment from (i) a CNE report which analyzed RD 661/2007; and (ii) the literal
wording of RD 661/2007 at paragraph 424 of the Award.**? Paragraph 424 of the Award
states:

“The regulations and regulatory reports also indicated that

adjustments to the FITs (other than annual adjustments for inflation)
would apply only to new facilities. In particular:

s

The 2007 CNE Report called for ‘regular reviews that only affect
new facilities.”

. This approach was given effect in Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007,
pursuant to which reviews were to be held in 2010 and every four
years thereafter, but the revisions of FITs would not affect
installations that had been authorized before the revision and for up
to two years after the revision.

S

The 2008 CNE Report stated that existing facilities would be
exempted from periodic reviews.

When Respondent concluded in 2007 that progress towards the
target for PV capacity had been more rapid than expected, it issued
an order setting an end-date for applicability of FITs assigned

pursuant to RD 661/2007, but did not reduce the FITs assigned to
existing plants. Instead, the reduced FITs established in RD
1578/2008 did not apply to plants that had been assigned higher
FITs under RD 661/2007.

s

RD 1578/2008 specified a mechanism for quarterly updates of the

FITs assigned to be assigned to new plants, such that the ‘support

framework’ could be ‘adapted rapidly enough to keep pace with the

evolution of technology.’ These updates did not affect plants to which

a FIT had previously been assigned”.

189. Contrary to Spain’s submissions, the Committee finds that the Award does not support the
inference that the Tribunal had applied RD 661/2007 “in its entirety” instead of RD
1578/2008. Indeed, the fact that the Tribunal expressly considered rules applicable under
RD 1578/2008 at paragraph 424 (d) and (e) indicates that the Tribunal was not applying
RD 661/2007 instead of the regulation that was in force at the relevant time. It is clear to
the Committee that the Tribunal was considering RD 661/2007 (being the predecessor of
RD 1578/2008) as part of its analysis on the legitimate expectations that an investor might
have formed under RD 1578/2008.

190. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that the Award refers to multiple factors
which are not limited to RD 661/2007. These include the evolution of the regulatory
scheme leading up to the Claimant’s investment in 2010 (including the differences between
RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008), the express wording of RD 1578/2008,7"° Spain’s

291

pronouncements on its regulations,”*! the case law of Spain’s Supreme Court?” the

economic circumstances as of the date of the Claimant’s investment,”** and the Parties’

positions on European Commission decisions on state aid.?°*

191. It is not unusual for a tribunal to take into account preceding legislation in order to interpret
subsequent legislation as part of a continuous regulatory process. In the Committee’s view,

this is exactly what the Tribunal did in the Underlying Arbitration. As such, Spain’s

argument that the Award ought to be annulled because the Tribunal assumed the full
application of a regime which was not applicable to the Claimant” has no factual

foundation and is consequently dismissed.

Regarding Spain’s arguments relating to the Tribunal’s interpretation of the Fifth
Additional Provision, the Committee’s view is that the Tribunal’s reasons were clearly
articulated. In coming to the conclusion that “a prudent investor operating under RD
1578/2008 could reasonably have understood the Fifth Additional provision to
contemplate ‘downward modification’ only for new plants” (as opposed to existing ones),
the Tribunal explained that this was because “existing PV plants cannot benefit from
technological evolution” and expressly stated that this conclusion was consistent with the
position that the CNE indicated in 2009 in respect of an investor’s query and the preamble
of RD 1578/2008."

Insofar as Spain argues that the Tribunal’s reasoning was wrong, this cannot constitute a
ground of annulment. The function of this Committee is not to review the correctness of a
tribunal’s decision, but rather to determine whether any of the annulment grounds in Article
52 has been established. As explained above, the Tribunal’s reasoning was stated in the

Award.

In the premises, the Committee finds no reason to conclude that the Award failed to state

reasons relating to its consideration of RD 661/2007 in the Award.

B. ‘WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL FAILED TO STATE ITS REASONS IN RESPECT OF THE
CLAIMANT’S LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS

ji Spain’s Position

Spain contends that although the “scope of the legitimate expectations of the Claimant
might have been the core element of the dispute”, the Tribunal “did not conduct any

thorough analysis and, more serious still, did not provide the Parties with the grounds

upon such which its conclusions were reached”.®’ Spain raises 4 main grounds of

contention.

First, Spain argues that the Tribunal does not explain what a legitimate expectation means
to a stable feed-in tariff (“FIT”). According to Spain, while the Award clarifies that the
legitimate expectations in question were not limited to obtaining a reasonable return or ad
eternum maintenance of the tariffs in force at the time of the investment, it does not actually

identify what a “stable FIT” or “stable remuneration” actually means.?°*

In particular, Spain argues that the Tribunal does not explain: (i) if the “stable FIT” had to
remain in force and unchanged for 25 years; (ii) if the “stable FIT” allowed for some kind
of change other than inflation; and (iii) if the “stable FIT’ did allow changes, which

changes are admissible and which are not.”

Secondly, Spain argues that the Award does not explain the sources of the alleged
legitimate expectations. While Spain acknowledges that the functions of the Committee
are limited and that it is not an appellate court, it claims that it “cannot help but ask some
questions” about the sources listed at paragraph 423 of the Award (comprising 2 CNE
reports and the preamble of RD 1578/2008).*” Specifically, Spain questions how to
reconcile the Tribunal’s finding that Article 10(1) of the ECT does not operate as a
stabilization provision with the Tribunal’s finding that the “almost identical statement in
the CNE report” constitutes such a commitment.*”! Spain further also questions why the
“generic mention of a Preamble [...] should be assimilated to a limit for the exercise of

legislative power by a sovereign State”.>°

In addition, Spain also takes issue with the sources listed at paragraphs 424 and 426 of the
Award (comprising CNE reports and Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007, as well as a press

release by Spain and other statements made by Spain and its officials).*°? According to
Spain, “none of these sources generated the commitment that the Award ends up
extracting” °° Spain further claims that even though the Tribunal recognized that “some
of the statements introduced by Claimant have insufficient clarity and precision to establish
that the FITs would be stable, although they do lend support to [the Tribunal’s]
conclusions”, the Tribunal still assumed that these statements were valid in an “exercise of

probability” (emphasis in original).

Thirdly, Spain contends that the Award does not explain the reasons why it places the
investment date in March 2010 (as the Claimant alleged in the Underlying Arbitration) as
opposed to May 2010 (as Spain alleged in the Underlying Arbitration). Specifically, Spain
alleges that the Award leaves unexplained why the financial transactions of May 2010

should or should not be considered as part of the investment process.*”°

Fourthly, Spain argues that the Award does not explain the reasons why it rejects that the
legitimate expectations of investors consisted of a reasonable return. Spain acknowledges
that the Committee is not an appellate court, but argues that the Committee can annul the

Award if the reasoning is “frivolous”.°°”

In Spain’s submission, the Tribunal’s rejection of its argument rests solely on a generic
reference to “‘[Spain’s] regulations and regulatory reports, as well as its pronouncements
about those regulations, the case law of Spain's Supreme Court’ as well as the ‘economic
circumstances as of the date of Claimant's investment” >°* According to Spain, this is
frivolous because: (i) all of the regulations, and regulatory reports and the case law of
Spain’s Supreme Court alluded to reasonable return as the ultimate objective of the Spanish

system to support renewable energy; and (ii) the “economic circumstances as of the date

of Claimant's investment” referred to the “global economic crisis and the tariff deficit in

Spain” which could hardly justify the perpetuation of the tariffs.°”

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant alleges that the Tribunal’s reasoning on the issue of legitimate expectations
reads smoothly from one element to the next without difficulty and is easily understood by
reading the paragraphs in the order in which they were written.*!° According to the

Claimant, the Tribunal explained these legitimate expectations as follows:*!!

(a) The Tribunal started its analysis by determining the investment date, i.e. March

2010.

(b) The Tribunal had to determine whether the Claimant’s legitimate expectations were
confined to a reasonable return with reference to the cost of money in capital
markets (as Spain contended) or embraced specific “essential elements” including

a stable FIT (as the Claimant contended).

(c) The Tribunal carried out its analysis of the Claimant’s legitimate expectations as of
the investment date on the basis of the evidence put before it by the parties. This
evidence included: Spanish Royal Decrees, CNE Reports, statements made by
Spain, the case law of the Spanish Supreme Court, the economic circumstances at
the time of investment, the parties’ expert regulatory reports and presentations, and

the EC decisions on state aid.

(d) In light of the above, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that “the legitimate
expectations of a PV investor in March 2010 were not limited to a reasonable
return in light of the cost of money in the capital markets, as determined by
Respondent. The evidence establishes instead that a PV investor in March 2010
had a legitimate expectation that it would receive a FIT that was stable, once

assigned to a PV plant, for the 25-year period specified in RD 1578/2008 (save for

inflation adjustment). The stable FIT was an essential element of the regulatory
regime on which Claimant relied when it made its investment decision, taking into
account the capital-intensity, long period of capital recovery and high leverage that

is characteristic of investments in PV plants”?!

The Claimant alleges that Spain’s arguments only display Spain’s disagreement with the

reasons stated, which is not a ground for annulment under the ICSID Convention.*!?

First, in response to Spain’s contentions that the Award failed to answer three general
questions as to what a “stable FIT” entails, the Claimant argues that the Tribunal’s
reasoning sufficiently addressed these issues in order to complete its analysis. According
to the Claimant, the Tribunal fulfilled its task to contemplate the Claimant’s legitimate
expectations and to ascertain whether those concrete legitimate expectations had been

violated on the basis of the evidence before the Tribunal.>"4

Secondly, in response to Spain’s criticisms of the sources of legitimate expectations, the
Claimant contends that the Award explains that the “/egitimacy of the investor’s
expectations and the host State’s scope to modify its regulatory regime without violating
the FET obligation must be measured in light of any undertakings of stability that are
contained in the laws, regulations and authoritative pronouncements of the host State,
upon which the investor relied when it made its investment™'> (emphasis added).
Moreover, the weight given to the Preamble of RD 1578/2008 by the Tribunal lies within

its discretion and cannot be reviewed by this Committee.*!°

According to the Claimant, the Tribunal did not blindly rely on evidence “in an exercise of
probability” as alleged by Spain.*'’ Instead, the Tribunal concluded that “/iJn the
aggregate, these statements confirm that the stability of remuneration was a key component

of the Original Regulatory Regime, which [was] emphasized by [Spain] in communications

intended to attract investments in renewable energy”.*'* According to the Claimant, this
shows that the Tribunal confirmed its primary reasoning based on the first group of sources

as mutually reinforced by its examination of the second group of sources.*!?

In any case, the Claimant alleges that there is no ground for annulment as this Committee’s

review does not entail the review of the evidence before the Tribunal.*7°

Thirdly, regarding the date of investment, the Claimant argues that the paragraph quoted
by Spain explicitly states the Tribunal’s reasoning.*”! In any case, the Tribunal affirmed
that the debate over the investment date was irrelevant when it concluded that “there were
no developments between March 2010 and May 2010 that could have altered in a material

way the legitimate expectations of a PV investor” >?

Fourthly, in response to Spain’s argument that legitimate expectations of investors
consisted of a reasonable return, the Claimant argues that Spain is inviting this Committee
to review the merits of the dispute.*” In any case, the Claimant argues that the “generic”
statement in paragraph 443 of the Award is not the sole basis of the Tribunal’s reasoning
as Spain alleges, but followed an entire section in which the Tribunal analyzed the
Claimant’s expectations under RD 1578/2008 and amply set out its all the evidence

leadings to its conclusion.*7*

(iii) |The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee also finds that the Tribunal stated its reasons for finding that “a PV investor
in March 2010 had a legitimate expectation that it would receive a FIT that was stable,

once assigned to a PV plant, for the 25-year period specified in RD 1578/2008 (save for

The Tribunal came to this conclusion after considering:

the evolution of the regulatory scheme leading up to the Claimant’s investment in

Regulatory Regime would eventually have been found to be inconsistent with EU

requirements.**>

In the Committee’s view, there is no difficulty in following the Tribunal’s reasoning as set

out above which led to its findings on the Claimant’s legitimate expectations.

Spain’s first argument is that the Award leaves three questions regarding the “stable FIT”
unanswered. Essentially, Spain claims that the Tribunal failed to explain precisely what the
“stable FIT” entails. However, in the Committee’s view, the Award does in fact shed light
on this issue. As noted by Spain, the Award actually clarifies that the legitimate
expectations in question were not limited to obtaining a reasonable return in light of the

cost of money in the capital markets (as Spain had argued in the Underlying Arbitration).>*

Moreover, contrary to Spain’s allegations, the Award squarely addressed the question of
whether the “stable FIT’ allowed for a change other than inflation (albeit in the section
discussing Spain’s liability with regard to the First Set of Disputed Measures). On that
issue, the Tribunal found that even though RD 2/2013 (i.e. the change in the method for
indexing FITs) and RD 14/2010 (i.e. the imposition of a cap on hours) appeared to reduce
the Claimant’s revenue during the limited period while the measures were in effect, they
“did not remove the essential features of the regulatory regime in place when Claimant
invested” > In the Committee’s view, when the Award is taken as a whole, it is clear that
the “stable FIT” allowed for changes other than inflation. If this were not the case, the
changes resulting from Spain’s introduction of RD 2/2013 and RD 14/2010 would have

attracted liability on Spain’s part.

In any case, the Committee agrees with the Claimant that the Tribunal’s reasoning
sufficiently addressed these issues in order to complete its analysis regarding the Second
Set of Disputed Measures. In this regard, the key question before the Tribunal was whether

the abolition of the previous regime, which eliminated the FITs that had been assigned to

the Claimant’s plants, constituted a breach of Spain’s obligations to accord the Claimant

FET treatment.

As stated in the Award: “Claimant's case is not that it had a legitimate expectation to a
particular rate of return. It claims instead that it had a legitimate expectation to stable
remuneration in the form of the FIT set for each plant pursuant to RD 1578/2008. It is
on this basis that the Tribunal has reached its conclusion on [Spain’s] liability’>**
(emphasis added). As such, the Committee is not persuaded that it was necessary for the
Award to set out an all-encompassing definition setting out the exact parameters of what a

“stable FIT” actually means in order to justify the Tribunal’s findings on Spain’s liability.

Spain’s second argument is that the sources of legitimate expectations were not explained
in the Award. The Committee disagrees. As noted by Spain, the Award plainly identifies
numerous sources of legitimate expectations (such as CNE Reports, the literal wording of
RD 1578/2008 in the light of its predecessor, RD 661/2007, a press release and statements
by Spain).

While it is clear that Spain disagrees with the contents of the Tribunal’s findings regarding
these sources, this Committee is not an appellate court and has limited functions (as Spain
acknowledges). Article 52(1)(e) simply does not allow the Committee to assess “the
‘correctness or persuasiveness’ of the reasoning in the award or inquire into the quality or
merits of the reasons”.**° Spain is essentially asking the Committee to assess whether the
Tribunal correctly extracted a commitment from Spain to maintain a stable FIT from these

sources.**” This clearly relates to the merits and is not a valid ground for annulment.

Spain’s third argument is that the Award does not explain the reasons why the Claimant’s
investment was found to take place in March 2010 instead of May 2010. Again, the
Committee disagrees. The Tribunal’s reasoning is explicitly stated in the paragraph cited

by Spain — as “Claimant made its investment in Spain in March 2010, when it acquired its

interest in Fotones and engaged in financing transactions in May 2010” and there were
“no developments between March 2010 and May 2010 that could have altered in a material
way the legitimate expectations of a PV investor’, the Tribunal “therefore assessed
Claimant's legitimate expectations as of the time when it made its investment, i.e., March

2010" 338

The Committee also disagrees with Spain’s fourth argument that the Award does not
explain why the Tribunal rejected Spain’s argument that the legitimate expectations of
investors consisted of a reasonable return. Spain claims that the Tribunal’s rejection of its
argument rests solely on a “generic reference”*” in paragraph 443 of the Award. However,
as pointed out by the Claimant, this reference was preceded by an entire section wherein
the Tribunal analyzed the Claimant’s expectations under RD 1578/2008 in detail, with

ample reasons as summarized above at paragraph 212.

For the reasons set out above, the Committee finds that the Tribunal has stated its reasons
for concluding that “a PV investor in March 2010 had a legitimate expectation that it would
receive a FIT that was stable, once assigned to a PV plant, for the 25-year period specified
in RD 1578/2008 (save for inflation adjustment)” and that “t]he stable FIT was an
essential element of the regulatory regime on which Claimant relied when it made its
investment decision” .**° The fact that Spain disagrees with the correctness of the Tribunal’s
explanations does not give rise to a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the

ICSID Convention.

Cc. ‘WHETHER THE REASONING IN THE AWARD IS CONTRADICTORY
ji Spain’s Position

Spain contends that there is an inherent contradiction between the conclusions on liability
and quantum in the Award. According to Spain, the Tribunal “seemed to insis?” that it was

“not its decision that the Spanish renewable energy support regime should remain

unchanged throughout the lifespan of the plants’

” 341 and that this apparent finding

contradicts with its findings on quantum where it assumed that the tariffs contained in RD

1578/2008 would remain unchanged.*4”

Spain further asserts that “there are infinite reasons in the reasoning that contradict each

other” ** In addition to the alleged contradiction between liability and quantum, Spain

claims that the following stand out:

(a)

(b)

the Tribunal makes “continuous ups and downs”*+4

when defining the Claimant’s
legitimate expectations in a logic that is impossible to follow. Specifically, the
Tribunal’s findings that: (i) “the laws and regulations that were in place when
Claimant made its investment in March 2010 did not expressly state that the FIT
assigned to a plant would be retained for 25 years. Instead, RD 1578/2008 stated
that a FIT assigned to a facility applied ‘for a maximum period of twenty-five
years ”’;*+ (ii) there is no stabilization clause in Article 10(1) of the ECT;*4° and
(iii) “there were ‘warning signs’ that Spain would act in some manner to correct
the tariff deficit, possibly leading to some diminution in the remuneration of existing
plants” conflict with its finding of the existence of a “stable FIT’ for “the 25-year
period specified in RD 1378/2008”;>4"

the Tribunal admitted that the Treaties of the European Union were part of the
regulations that should be applied to the merits but then excluded them from their
consideration as applicable regulations or as part of the factual aspect that

configures the Claimant’s legitimate expectations;*#*

(c) the Tribunal found that RD 14/2010 (which imposed a limitation on the number of
hours of equivalent operation) was not inconsistent with Spain’s FET obligations
but then the limitation of hours was allegedly “offered as a reason” for Spain’s
violation of its FET obligations for the Second Set of Disputed Measures.**? Spain
accepts that the Tribunal was referring to different reforms, but asserts that the
Award does not explain why the Tribunal concluded that limiting the number of
hours did not infringe the ECT in respect of the first set of measures, but justified
the condemnation on the fact that the number of production hours was limited in

respect of the second set of measures.**°

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

225. Regarding the alleged contradiction on whether the Spanish renewable energy support
regime should remain unchanged,**! the Claimant argues that while the Tribunal
recognized that “there were ‘warning signs’ that Spain would act in some manner to

correct the tariff deficit, possibly leading to some diminution in the remuneration of

existing plants”,>* this only presents half of the picture. The Claimant points out that the

Tribunal went on to state that:**?

“However, the reports attributed to participants in the renewable
energy sector do not establish that a prudent PV investor in March 2010
should have expected that [Spain] would decide, as the means to
address the tariff deficit, to reduce the FITs of existing plants and to
abolish the Special Regime. If [Spain] had contemplated doing so as of
the time of Claimant's investment, those intentions were not transparent

to investors”.>*4

226. Regarding the alleged contradiction in the Tribunal’s conclusion that the EU treaty

Tribunal’s reasoning. The status of those provisions was not dispositive of the issue.
Rather, the Tribunal rejected the application of EU law to the merits on the basis of the

Parties’ choice of law, pursuant to the ECT.*°>

With regard to the limitation of the number of hours of equivalent operation, the Claimant
argues that there is no contradiction. The Claimant emphasizes that the Tribunal’s findings
were on two distinct measures which applied during distinct period - the cap on hours
implemented by RD 14/2010 (part of the First Set of Disputed Measures) and the cap on
hours implemented by Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 (part of the Second Set of

Disputed Measures).°**°

According to the Claimant, Brattle’s evidence reflects that there
can be no correlation between the two caps on hours measures as they were implemented

in different regulatory contexts and apply to completely different remuneration schemes.**”

(iii) |The Committee’s Analysis
The Committee disagrees with Spain’s arguments that the Award should be annulled on

the basis that it contains “contradictory” reasoning in the conclusions on liability and the

conclusions on quantum.

As stated above at paragraph 84, in order to serve as ground for annulment, the alleged
contradictory reasons must be clear, and so egregious that they cause the said reasons in
the award to be incapable of standing together on any reasonable reading of the decision.

In the Committee’s view, this high standard has not been met.

Spain’s first main argument is premised on the Tribunal having made a finding that “it was
not its decision that the Spanish renewable energy support regime should remain
unchanged throughout the lifespan of the plants”.*°* However, Spain admits that the
Tribunal only “seemed” to insist that this was the case. While the Committee is not

convinced that the Tribunal made a categorical finding to this effect, it is clear that the

mere appearance of a conflicting position is not the same as a clear contradiction that would

render the reasons in the Award incapable of standing together.

The Committee also struggles to see any contradiction in the Tribunal’s conclusion
regarding the applicable law. In the Committee’s view, there was simply no finding that

the TFEU had to be applied to the merits.

As for the point on the limitation of the number of hours of equivalent operation, the
Committee considers that there was no clear or obvious contradiction on this issue. The
Committee is of the view that the fact that the Tribunal had differing views on the impact
of a cap of hours imposed by distinct provisions under distinct regulatory contexts, taking
into account the different amount of evidence adduced, is not unreasonable or unreasoned,
and does not provide any ground for annulment within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) of

the ICSID Convention.

THE TRIBUNAL’S ESTABLISHMENT OF DAMAGES

To recap, the Award states that “[a]s a consequence of the breach of Article 10(1) of the
ECT, Respondent shall pay Claimant compensation in the amount of EUR 40.98
million”.>° This quantum of damages was later rectified to EUR 40.49 million in the

Tribunal’s Decision on Rectification on the basis that there was an arithmetical error.>

The Decision on Rectification explains that the figure of EUR 40.98 million was drawn
from a table contained in Appendix C to the first expert report of the Claimant’s damages
expert, Brattle (the “First Brattle Quantum Report”).*°! However, Brattle had updated

the figures contained in Appendix C to reflect an adjustment that it had made to the inflation

that accompanied its second report (“Second Brattle

Quantum Report”).

With regard to the Tribunal’s findings on damages, Spain seeks to annul the Award on the
grounds that: (i) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its power when compensating damages
to the Claimant; and (ii) there was a failure to state reasons in the Award on the

quantification of damages. The Committee proceeds to address each of these issues in turn.

A. ‘WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL MANIFESTLY EXCEEDED ITS POWERS WHEN
COMPENSATING DAMAGES TO THE CLAIMANT

ji Spain’s Position

Spain argues that the Tribunal exceeded its powers when it adopted the quantification of
damages carried out by the Claimant’s expert (i.e. Brattle). In doing so, Spain claims that
the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by granting compensation on the basis that a//
the disputed measures were contrary to the ECT and no modifications to the regime of
RD 661/2007 had been implemented or were ever going to be implemented.** In
particular, Spain argues that just as the claimants in the Occidental case were unable to
receive 100% of the damages they sought because a portion of the investment had been
made by a party outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, if a Tribunal determines that the
measures in question are outside the scope of that jurisdiction or do not give rise to
responsibilities within the treaty in question, it may not grant compensation for such

measures without exceeding its powers.°*

It is argued that the Tribunal adopted the quantification of damages carried out by the

Claimant’s expert in spite of the fact that Spain was only found liable for the Second Set

of Disputed Measures (comprising RD-Act 9/2013, Act 24/2013, RD 413/2014 and the

Ministerial Order) and not the First Set of Disputed Measures.°°°

In Spain’s words, what it alleges as an “excess of powers is that the Award does NOT reflect
in the future damages awarded to SolEs Badajoz the fact that certain measures had been
declared lawful” (emphasis added).>”

Spain explains that Brattle’s calculations on future damages which the Tribunal relied on
were derived from comparing the cash flows of the Plants in two scenarios (i.e. the “But-

For scenario” and the “Actual scenario”),*® as illustrated in Brattle’s graph below:*”

to a world without any of the Disputed Measures, but “forgets” to correct such an

adjustment when calculating the figure for damages.*”° Instead of assuming that the
RD 1578/2008 regime remained unchanged,*”! Spain argues that the Award should have
considered a But-For scenario without some (and not ail) of the Disputes Measures.
Specifically, the But-For scenario should have assumed that RD 14/2013 (i.e. relating to
the cap on hours) and RD 2/2013 (i.e. relating to the change in inflation index) were

maintained.>”

In Spain’s submission, the Award is “/imited to showing blind faith” in the figures set out
in the Second Brattle Quantum Report*”* and the Tribunal made a serious error when it
rejected the opinion from Spain’s expert, AMG, that there was a basis to question the
calculations presented by Brattle.” In other words, the Award assumes, without any basis,
that Brattle appropriately discounted the effects of the RD 14/2013 and RD 2/2013.
According to Spain, regardless of the specific appendix or figure, the underlying problem
is found in Brattle’s model itself as the But-For scenario starts from the absence of any

Disputed Measures.*”°

In these proceedings, Spain relies on two new expert reports (i.e. AMG’s New Report?”

and AMG’s Rebuttal Report*”’) that assess the damages which Spain claims are payable to
the Claimant in light of the Award. Spain argues that AMG’s evidence supports its
contention that the But-For scenario should only assume that the Second Set of Disputed
Measures was never implemented. However, the First Set of Disputed Measures “must be
considered effective and in force” in the But-For scenario and, therefore, their effect on

cash flows should be included.*”°

Spain does not deny that in reality, RD 14/2013 and RD 2/2013 were superseded by the
enactment of the July 2013 measures.*” However, Spain contends that these two measures
were “not enacted as temporary rules” and “therefore, they can only be assumed to be
permanent measures, subject (as always) to the power of the State to amend its own
regulations as it sees fit’.**° In Spain’s submission, these measures were “issued for an
indefinite period of time”,**' and were only repealed because of the entry into force of the
2013-2014 measures. As such, Spain argues “[i]f in the but-for scenario the 2013-2014
Measures disappear, the reason for the repeal of Royal Decree-Act 14/2010 and Royal
Decree-Act 2/2013 also disappears, so that these Measures must necessarily remain in

place” 382

According to Spain, if the Tribunal had made or requested adjustments to Brattle’s But-
For scenario (once past damages have been ruled out) to include the effects of the First Set
of Disputed Measures, it would have verified that the difference between the cash flows
between both scenarios was only 16.15 million euros (being the amount of future
damages).*** Spain argues that a correct quantification of the damages would comprise the
aforementioned future damages of 16.15 million euros plus past damages of 2.56 million

euros, totaling 18.71 million euros.***

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that Spain misrepresents the Tribunal’s quantification of damages and
that the Tribunal had in fact “adjusted the amount awarded to [the Claimant] by removing
the entirety of the damages attributable to the First Set of Disputed Measures, consistent

with its liability ruling” >*°

The Claimant submits that the Tribunal decided that the amount of compensation to be
awarded to the Claimant should be adjusted to reflect the damages that resulted from the
Second Set of Disputed Measures alone, and relied on Table 21, Row 8, Column C of

Appendix C to Brattle’s First Quantum Report in order to do this.**°

In the Claimant’s submission, Brattle’s calculations enabled the Tribunal both to account
for its decision regarding the TVPEE tax and to identify the distinct amount of damages
attributable to each of: (i) the December 2010 limit on production hours (Appendix C,
Table 21, Row 6); (ii) the February 2013 change in the inflation index (Appendix C, Table
21, Row 7); and (iii) the July 2013 measures (Appendix C, Table 21, Row 8 — i.e. the
Second Set of Disputed Measures) — and thereby isolate the damages attributable to the

Second Set of Disputed Measures.**”

In response to Spain’s arguments that the But-For scenario should have included
RD 14/2010 and RD 2/2013, the Claimant stresses that the factual reality is that these two
measures were “only in place for a limited time” before being superseded by the July 2013
measures.*** Accordingly, Appendix C, Table 21, Column C reflects no future damages
arising from these two measures as they no longer produced any economic effect after they
were superseded.**? The Claimant contends that “the Tribunal took the non-controversial
view that the superseded, non-existent measures did not impact the damages analysis” .°°°
Regarding RD 2/2013 in particular, the Claimant criticizes AMG’s assumption that the
annual rate of change of the adjusted inflation/adjusted CPI would consistently grow at an
annual rate 1% below the general CPI that originally applied to FITs under RD
1578/2008.*?! The Claimant relies on Brattle’s analysis that the adjusted CPI and the
general CPI closely tracked one another between 2010 and 2019, and the adjusted CPI

increased faster than the general CPI between the years 2014 and 2020.**? Moreover, the
Claimant takes issue with the fact that AMG did not quantify the impact of hypothetical

changes to the CPI in the Underlying Arbitration.***

With regard to damages corresponding to the TVPEE, the Claimant stresses that the
Tribunal adopted Brattle’s calculations under the “Generation Tax: Legal” scenario in
Table 21 of Appendix C, and thus, the Tribunal’s damages award excluded the effect of
the TVPEE both before and afier July 2013.°°* The Claimant further argues that the 7.65
million euros that AMG calculates as future damages due to the TVPEE corresponds to the
7.65 million euros that Brattle itself attributed to the post-July 2013 effect of the TVPEE
in the Underlying Arbitration (as excluded by the “Generation Tax: Legal” scenario in

Table 21 of Appendix C).°°

Additionally, the Claimant makes the general point that the Tribunal had all the evidence
it required to quantify damages on the basis of its liability decision and ruled accordingly,
and that its conclusions were consistent with its findings on liability.** In particular, the
Claimant highlights that Spain had the opportunity to question Mr. Caldwell (from Brattle)
on the “stand-alone impact of the limit on production hours and of the inflation indexation,
rows 2 and 3 [of Table 21 of Appendix C]”*?' which it now takes issue with. When asked
why only past damages relating to these measures were calculated, Mr. Caldwell allegedly
replied that this reflected the fact that these two measures had been superseded by the new

regime and confirmed that he calculated no future damage for them beyond July 2013.7

Accordingly, the Claimant argues that in addition to being unjustified, Spain’s criticism of
the Award is an attempt to reargue the damages case based on arguments and evidence that

neither Spain nor AMG presented during the arbitration proceedings.*””

(iii) |The Committee’s Analysis

At the outset, the Committee must emphasize again that the annulment mechanism is not
an appeal mechanism. As stated above at paragraph 56, the annulment process is only
concerned with the legitimacy of the process of the decision, not its substantive correctness.
The Committee is not in a position to review the matter de novo and substitute the
Tribunal’s findings with its own, nor should it allow the Parties to relitigate matters with

the benefit of hindsight in order to secure a better outcome.

Against this backdrop and having considered the Parties’ arguments, the Committee does
not find that the damages awarded by the Tribunal were a manifest excess of its powers.

The following analysis reflects the Committee’s position by majority.

Asa starting point, it is clear to the Committee that the Tribunal was aware that the quantum
of damages to be awarded to the Claimant had to be adjusted to take into account that Spain
was not found liable for the First Set of Disputed Measures (i.e. the TVPEE, RD 14/2010
and RD 2/2013). This was expressly acknowledged at paragraph 538 of the Award which

states:

“Having examined the positions of the experts and the Parties in
relation to the effect of the Disputed Measures on the fair market value
of Claimant’s investment, the Tribunal concludes that Brattle’s DCF
analysis provides a sound basis for the Tribunal to determine the
reduction in the fair market value of Claimant's investment. However,
the amount of damages to be awarded to Claimant must be adjusted
to take into account (1) the Tribunal’s conclusion that it lacks
jurisdiction in respect of Claimant’s contention that the TVPEE
violates Article 10(1) of the ECT and (2) the Tribunal’s finding that
Spain is not liable as to the First Set of Disputed Measures” (emphasis
added).

39 Counter-Memorial on Annulment, 492.

84

256. After making clear that the amount of damages had to be adjusted to exclude those
corresponding to the TVPEE, RD 14/2010 or RD 2/2013, the Tribunal then relied on
Appendix C to the First Brattle Quantum Report which presented a figure that
corresponded only to the Second Set of Disputed Measures, on the assumption that the

TVPEE was legal:

“Brattle has indicated the damages that it associates with particular
measures in Appendix C to the First Brattle Quantum Report). One set
of calculations assumes (as is the case) that the Tribunal has not
found the TVPEE to be illegal. On this basis, Brattle presents the
damages that it attributes to (i) the limit on production hours, (ii) the
change in the inflation index (which, taken together, correspond to the
First Set of Disputed Measures) and (iii) the July 2013 measures
(corresponding to the Second Set of Disputed Measures). Brattle
calculates that the July 2013 measures reduced the fair market value
of Claimant’s investment by 40.98 million”*”° (emphasis added).
257. As stated above, the Tribunal later rectified the Award to change the figure to EUR 40.49
million when it was highlighted to the Tribunal that the figures in Appendix C had been

updated to account for inflation.

258. Spain argues that the Award “forgets” that “in order for its conclusions on damages to be
consistent with its conclusions on liability, the Award should have considered a but-for
scenario without some Disputed Measures”.*' However, it is clear from the paragraphs
cited above that the Tribunal sought to adjust the damages such that only damages

attributed to the Second Set of Disputed Measures were captured.

For the majority of the Committee, what Spain is really saying is that the Tribunal was
wrong to adjust the damages in the manner that it did. However, the Committee notes that
the Tribunal’s method of adjustment was in line with Brattle’s expert evidence which
presented a figure that (in Brattle’s view) corresponded solely to the Second Set of
Disputed Measures. As shown in Table 21 of Appendix C of the First Brattle Quantum
Report which is reproduced below, the figure of EUR 40.98 million was the total amount
of past and future damage which Brattle attributed to the “July 2013 Measures” when one
assumes that the TVPEE was legal (see Row [8]). This was distinct from the damage which
Brattle attributed to: (i) the limit on production hours (i.e. RD 14/2010) (see Row [6]); and
(ii) the change in the inflation index (i.e. RD 2/2013) (see Row [7]).4

In the Committee’s view, it is difficult to see how the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its
powers in relying on Brattle’s evidence set out above which clearly distinguishes between
the damages attributable to the Second Set of Dispute Measures (i.e. the “July 2013
Measures” and the damages attributable to the First Set of Disputed Measures (i.e. RD

14/2010, RD 2/2013 and the TVPEE).

Spain’s criticizes the methodology employed by Brattle with regard to how the future
damages should be calculated on the basis that the But-For scenario should have (but did
not) assume that RD 14/2010 (i.e. relating to the cap on hours) and RD 2/2013 (i.e. relating
to the change in inflation index) were maintained. However, in the Committee’s view, the
Tribunal was acting within its powers when it accepted the But-For scenario put forth by
Brattle given that RD 14/2010 and RD 2/2013 simply did not exist as of the valuation date
for future damages (i.e. June 2014).

While Spain makes assertions in these proceedings regarding the permanence of Spanish
legislation once it has been enacted, it does not appear that Spain had adduced proof to
support this point or even raise this for the Tribunal’s consideration in the Underlying
Arbitration. Under these premises, the Committee struggles to see how the Tribunal can be
faulted for not making the assumption that in the absence of the Second Set of Disputed
Measures the earlier measures would not have been repealed and insisting that the But-For
scenario take these into account, especially given the inherently speculative nature of such

an argument.

Spain has taken particular objection to the Tribunal’s analysis at paragraph 540 of the

Award which states:

“The Tribunal has taken note of the quantum presentation made by
AMG at the Hearing, in which AMG contended that Brattle does not
divide the individual effects of the Measures in its future damages
calculation. In that presentation, AMG stated that the generation tax
(i.e., the TVPEE) and the limit on production hours accounted for 44%
of the damages claimed by SolES, and “only 56 percent” of the claimed
damages result from RDL 9/2013 (which abolished the Special Regime
and replaced it with the Specific Regime) and RDL 2/2013 (which
changed the inflation index). Respondent made a similar observation in
its post-hearing brief. The Tribunal notes that AMG’s presentation at
the Hearing was based on Figure 1 in Brattle’s First Quantum Report,
which depicts in general terms the ‘three principal steps’ that Brattle
undertook in its damages calculation. That figure does not isolate the
damages attributable to the July 2013 measures from earlier measures,
as was done in Appendix C of Brattle’s First Quantum Report. The
Tribunal does not find in AMG’s presentation at the Hearing a basis to

267.

question the calculations presented by Brattle in Appendix C of its First

Quantum Report”.*°
However, the Committee is not persuaded that the above constitutes a “serious error” as
alleged by Spain.*°* In the Committee’s view, it was perfectly reasonable and not a
manifest excess of powers for the Tribunal to conclude that AMG had not shown a basis
to question Brattle’s calculations when AMG itself did not isolate the damages attributable

to the Second Set of Disputed Measures.

Moreover, the Committee notes that paragraph 540 of the Award is preceded by numerous
paragraphs which set out, in considerable detail, the Tribunal’s analysis on why it preferred

Brattle’s method of quantifying the Claimant’s investment over AMG’s analysis.*°°

With the benefit of hindsight, Spain has adduced new expert reports to support its
arguments on what the correct quantum of damages ought to be in light of the outcome of
the Award. While the Committee accepts Spain’s point that the calculations presented are
not entirely “new” evidence per se given that they were based on the matrix of the
Claimant’s expert that had been accepted by the Tribunal, the Committee disagrees that
this would have “emerged naturally from the facts and evidence before the Tribunal” if the

proper analysis had been performed.*”°

The Tribunal cannot be expected to navigate the complex area of the quantification of
damages unaided by experts. While Spain had every opportunity to adduce evidence or

the different measures which might have enabled the Tribunal to come to a different

conclusion on damages.

The limitations faced by the Tribunal were canvassed in Professor Giorgio Sacerdoti’s
individual views set out at paragraphs 544-546 of the Award.*°* In those paragraphs,
Professor Sacerdoti expressed regret that the evidence before the Tribunal required it to
choose between “Claimant’s valuation, which was based on a ‘But-for’ scenario with a
25-year duration of the feed-in tariffs set in 2010 under the Special Regime, and [Spain’s]
DCF valuation, [...] pursuant to which the regulatory risk in the but-for scenario was so
high that Claimant’s investment would have increased in value due to the Disputed
Measures”.*°? He further stated that he would have “welcomed evidence on the basis of
which the Tribunal could have accepted Claimant's general approach to liability and
quantum without also accepting Claimant's premise that the Original Regulatory Regime

would remain stable for 25 years”.*°

In the Committee’s view, the elaborate quantifications which Spain has put forth in the
present proceedings is a far cry from the Occidental decision which Spain attempts to
analogize with the present case. In Occidental, the ad hoc committee found that the tribunal
illicitly expanded the scope of its jurisdiction in excess of its powers by compensating a
protected investor for an investment which is beneficially owned by a non-protected
investor.*!! This is different from the present case where Spain is essentially complaining
about the methodology used by the Tribunal in calculating future damages. Spain seeks to
argue that there was a similar excess of powers in this case because the Tribunal allegedly
exceeded its powers by giving compensation for measures (i.e. the First Disputed Set of
Measures) which did not give rise to responsibility under the ECT.*!? The Committee
disagrees. Unlike Occidental, Spain’s complaint about the methodology used by the
Tribunal to calculate damages does not go towards jurisdiction. In the Committee’s view,

the Tribunal was not compensating Claimant for any of the First Set of Disputed Measures

when it accepted Brattle’s calculations on the appropriate damages attributable to the

Second Set of Disputed Measures.

Further, unlike Occidental where there was an obvious mistake when the Claimant was
granted damages corresponding to 100% of the cash flows of the investment when it only
owned 60% of the investment, Spain is not requesting a simple arithmetical calculation. In
contrast, Spain is effectively asking the Committee to reconsider the issue of damages
based on new arguments which it has formulated with the benefit of reviewing the outcome

of the Award.

In view of the foregoing, the Committee is not persuaded that the Tribunal manifestly

exceeded its power in respect of the quantification of damages.

A Member of the Committee is concurring with this conclusion on the basis of separate

considerations which are set out in the attachment to this decision.

B. WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL FAILED TO STATE ITS REASONS ON THE
QUANTIFICATION OF DAMAGES

ji Spain’s Position

Spain alleges that the Tribunal’s conclusion on the quantification of damages as condensed

7413 and does not

at paragraph 540 of the Award presents “an evident lack of motivation
“dedicate a single word to justif{y] why it rejects AMG’s criticisms’*'4 of Brattle’s
analysis. According to Spain, the Award simply assumes “as an act of faith”, that Appendix
C of the First Brattle Quantum Report discounted the future effect of the measures

considered legal.*!°

Spain further argues that the Award does not explain whether the measures that were found
to be legal (i.e. the First Set of Disputed Measures) should be applied permanently in the

But-For scenario or whether they should be applied on a provisional basis even though this

question was posed to the Claimant’s damages expert on cross examination and addressed

in its Post-Hearing Brief.*!°

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that paragraph 540 is in itself sufficiently clear as to the reasons for
the Tribunal’s conclusions.*!” According to the Claimant, the essence of the Tribunal’s
observation with regard to AMG’s quantum presentation at the hearing is that it does not
distinguish the two measures from 2013. The distinction between these two measures is
crucial, as RD 9/2013 is part of the Second Set of Disputed Measures and RD 2/2013 is
part of the First Set of Disputed Measures.*!® As AMG made no effort in the Underlying
Arbitration to distinguish these two measures, the Tribunal turned to Brattle’s expert report

which clearly made such distinction.*!

The Claimant further asserts that paragraph 540 followed a thorough investigation of the
elements leading to that conclusion.*?° According to the Claimant, the Tribunal had
determined the best method to quantify the reduction in the fair market value of the
Claimant’s investment, then proceeded to adjust the damages calculation to reflect its
finding that the First Set of Disputed Measures had not violated the ECT. In this regard,
the Tribunal reviewed the expert reports from both Parties, referring to them specifically,

and ultimately accepted Brattle’s calculation.*?!

Regarding Spain’s argument that the Award does not explain whether the First Set of
Disputed Measures should be applied permanently or temporarily in the But-For scenario,
the Claimant argues that the Tribunal addressed the substance of Spain’s argument and
cannot be faulted for not couching its decision in the terms that Spain now advances in

these annulment proceedings.*?”

(iii) |The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee, by majority, is not persuaded that there was a failure to state reasons on

the quantification of damages.

The Committee agrees with the Claimant that paragraph 540 of the Award (as reproduced
above at paragraph 263) is sufficiently clear as to the reasons for the Tribunal’s
conclusions. As stated above, the applicable standard for annulment based on a failure to
state reasons is whether the ruling to allows the reader to “follow how the tribunal
proceeded from Point A. to Point B.”.*?> In the Committee’s view, this standard is clearly
met as it is apparent from a cursory read of that paragraph that the Tribunal rejected AMG’s
evidence in favor of Brattle’s since AMG failed to isolate the damages attributable to the

July 2013 measures from earlier measures whereas Brattle did.

As for Spain’s argument that the Award does not explain whether the First Set of Disputed
Measures should be applied permanently or temporarily in the But-For scenario, the
Committee disagrees with Spain’s suggestion that the Tribunal was obliged address this
specific issue in the Award. In this regard, the Committee agrees with the view of previous
annulment committees (as summarized in the TECO decision) that “in order to discharge
its duty to provide reasons for its decision, a tribunal is not under an obligation to address

every piece of evidence in the record or every single argument made by the parties”.**+

This is especially given the fact that Spain’s current formulation of the issue (i.e. whether
the legal measures should have been applied permanently in the but-for scenario or whether
they should be applied on a provisional basis) was not stated in Spain’s Post-Hearing Brief
dated 10 September 2018. Instead, Spain’s Post-Hearing Brief stated that Brattle’s
calculations were “attributable to prior measures such as the generation tax of 7% (that
represents 17% of the purported damages) and the Permanent cap on production

advancing arguments to show why the First Set of Disputed Measures should be regarded

as permanent when they no longer existed in reality.

Contrary to Spain’s claim that this question was “widely debated’,*° it appears to the
Committee that the duration of the First Set of Disputed Measures was only touched upon
briefly on the last day of the hearing on the merits.*?” Indeed, during the Hearing on
Annulment, Spain acknowledged that its cross examination of Claimant’s damages expert
in this regard was “[p]erhaps a minimal discussion” and “perhaps it should have been

longer”.*”® Insofar as Spain has suggested that the Tribunal ought to have asked the parties

to “go more deeply into that point” if it “had felt that this was relevant”, the Committee

disagrees. The burden falls on Spain (not the Tribunal) to adduce evidence to support its

criticisms of the assumptions adopted by the Claimant’s damages expert.

The lack of evidence from Spain’s damages expert was emphasized in Professor

Sacerdoti’s individual views in the Award where he stated inter alia that:

“He would have welcomed evidence on the basis of which the
Tribunal could have accepted Claimant’s general approach to liability
and quantum without also accepting Claimant’s premise that the
Original Regulatory Regime would remain stable for 25 years. On the
basis of such evidence the Tribunal might have adjusted the analysis of
the Claimant's expert to base the calculation of damages (loss of value
of the investment due to the reduction of returns under the new regime)
on the difference between this adjusted But-for scenario (with a shorter
time horizon) and the actual scenario, based on the reduced returns
provided under the Disputed Measures.

Professor Sacerdoti acknowledges, however, that the Tribunal was
unable to perform such complicated calculations on its own motion
because neither Party pursued this approach, not even as a fallback,
subordinate or alternative argument, and specifically, because
[Spain] has not supplied the necessary information” (emphasis
added).*°

284. Similarly, the fact that Spain’s damages expert had not presented the methodological
assertions and calculations at the hearing on the merits (which it now relies on) was
highlighted in the Tribunal’s Decision on Rectification. In coming to its decision to reject
Spain’s request for the Award to be rectified on the grounds that the compensation ordered
by the Tribunal did not properly reflect the Tribunal’s findings on jurisdiction and liability
(the “First Request”), the Tribunal found that:

“[...] the First Request is premised on arguments regarding the

hodology for i: ing the d attributable to particular
measures that were considered and rejected by the Tribunal, supported
by a series of methodological assertions and calculations that
Respondent and AMG did not present at the hearing, but are described
in the AMG Memorandum as ‘necessary’ in view of the distinction that
the Award draws between lawful and unlawful measures. This is not a
request to correct an ‘arithmetical, clerical or similar error.’ Instead,
the First Request seeks a change in the substance of the Tribunal’s
Award on the basis of complex assertions about the methodology that,
in the view of Respondent, should have been used to calculate
damages” (emphasis added).**!

285. Against this backdrop, it is unsurprising that a detailed answer to the specific question of
whether the legal measures should have been applied permanently or provisionally was not

expressly stated in the Award.

286. In any case, the Committee considers that this issue has been implicitly addressed by the
Tribunal’s adoption of the calculations in Appendix C to the First Brattle Quantum Report
in which the First Set of Disputed Measures were only applied for the limited duration
when these measures were actually in effect. This is reinforced by Professor Sacerdoti’s
dissenting comments which make clear that the Tribunal had accepted the Claimant’s
valuation which was “based on a ‘But-for’ scenario with a 25-year duration of the feed-in
tariffs set in 2010 under the Special Regime” and operated on the “premise that the Original

Regulatory Regime would remain stable for 25 years” >>

A Member of the Committee dissents on this issue and his views are set out in the

attachment to this decision.

SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE

Spain submits that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure
in: (i) the decisions adopted by the Tribunal during the time when Dr. Stanimir A.
Alexandrov (“Dr. Alexandrov”) was part of the Tribunal, namely the then-Tribunal’s
decisions on documentary production and the intervention of the EC;** and (ii) the
Tribunal’s decision to allow the Claimant’s application to introduce two categories of
documents a few weeks before the hearing on the merits, namely, a note from the CNE
dated 22 October 2009 (“Document C-189”) and three emails and a presentation by Grant
Greatrex (““Greatrex Materials”).*** The Committee proceeds to address each of these

issues in turn.

A. ‘WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL SERIOUSLY DEPARTED FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE
OF PROCEDURE WHEN DR. ALEXANDROV WAS PART OF THE TRIBUNAL

ji Spain’s Position

By way of background, the Tribunal was initially made up of Judge Joan E. Donoghue,

(the President appointed by the Secretary-General of ICSID), Dr. Alexandrov (appointed

by the Claimant), and Ms. Anna Joubin-Bret (appointed by Spain).**°

In July 2017, Spain learned of facts that suggested that Dr. Alexandrov had maintained a
professional relationship with Brattle (i.e. the Claimant’s expert on damages), and hence

requested Dr. Alexandrov to make disclosures regarding his relationship with Brattle.**°

Subsequently, on 18 September 2017, Spain proposed the disqualification of Dr.

Alexandrov.**’ After written submissions by both Parties were submitted, the two non-

challenged arbitrators reported that they were not able to reach an agreement.*** On 24

October 2017, Dr. Alexandrov submitted his resignation as arbitrator.*?

Spain relies on the Eiser case where Dr. Alexandrov acted as a co-arbitrator.° In that case,
the award was annulled under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention (i.e. on the grounds
that “the Tribunal was not properly constituted”) due to the non-disclosure of the existence
of a continuing professional relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and the claimant’s expert

firm, Brattle, and specifically, one of the claimant’s damages expert, Mr. Lapuerta.*#!

The Eiser committee found that this relationship gave rise to an appearance of bias that
should have been disclosed to the parties, and the failure to disclose this circumstance
meant that the respondent, Spain, was deprived of its right to an independent and impartial
tribunal and consequently, its right of defence was infringed.*#? According to Spain, the
circumstances in the present case are exactly the same as the Eiser case as: (i)
Dr. Alexandrov was appointed by the Claimant in the Underlying Arbitration; (ii) both
Brattle and Mr. Lapuerta intervened as experts for the Claimant; and (iii) in these
proceedings, Dr. Alexandrov had not warned of his relationship with Brattle or
Mr. Lapuerta.4?

That said, Spain accepts that Dr. Alexandrov resigned from the Tribunal and that
“consequently, the award made in SolEs Badajoz cannot be annulled due to the improper

constitution of the tribunal”. Instead, Spain argues that although Dr. Alexandrov’s

involvement “did not affect the drafting of the final award”, it contaminated a good part of

the previous procedural decisions of the tribunal. “5

Specifically, Spain takes issue with: (i) the Tribunal’s decisions on documentary
production (by way of Procedural Order No. 4 of 14 April 2017);*“° and (ii) the intervention
of the European Commission (by way of Procedural Order No. 2 of 23 May 2016, and
Procedural Order No. 3 of 21 February 2017).*4”

With regard to the Tribunal’s decision on documentary production, Spain argues that this
resulted in “exaggeratedly unequal treatment” strongly in favor of the Claimant.*#* In
particular, the Claimant was granted 100% of its 9 document requests that were disputed
by Parties, while Spain was only granted half of its 8 document requests that were disputed
by Parties.” According to Spain, the “numbers speak for themselves”.*°°

As for the Tribunal’s decisions on the intervention of the EC, Spain raises objections
regarding the Tribunal’s decision to: (i) reject the EC’s first request dated 18 April 2016 to
intervene as amicus curiae on the grounds that it was premature;**! and (ii) allow the EC’s
second request dated 18 May 2017 to intervene as amicus curiae on the condition that it
provide an undertaking that it will comply with any decision on costs to be issued by the
1,422

Tribunal but deny the EC access to the case documents and to intervene at the

hearing.*°

According to Spain, it was deprived of receiving the EC’s “extremely valuable contribution

to the resolution of the dispute”, and that “the way in which the rejection took place is in

itself evidence of a new violation of the fundamental rules of procedure”.*** Specifically,
Spain argues that the rejection of the EC’s first request forced it to submit a new
application,**> and the EC ultimately did not intervene due to the Tribunal’s persistence
that it provide a guarantee.**° Spain also argues that the Tribunal’s decision to deny the EC

access to case documents or attend the hearing was unfavourable to Spain.**”

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that there is no substance to the link that Spain seeks to establish
between Dr. Alexandrov’s intervention in the Underlying Arbitration from February 2016
to October 2017 and the annulment of the Eiser award.*** In this regard, the Claimant
argues that unlike the Eiser proceedings, Dr. Alexandrov resigned from the Tribunal nearly

two years before the Award was issued.*°°

In addition, the Claimant asserts that although the Ziser committee concluded that Dr.
Alexandrov’s non-disclosure in that case deprived Spain of the opportunity to challenge
him, it made no finding that Dr. Alexandrov’s relationship was ipso facto improper.*% On
this basis, the Claimant submits that Spain’s challenge to Dr. Alexandrov and his
subsequent resignation in that case do not provide a basis for a finding of lack of

impartiality in the first place in the present case.*°!

With regard to the Tribunal’s decision on document production, the Claimant argues that
absent a close examination of the reasoning and circumstances of a tribunal’s ruling on
document production, the number and proportion of requests granted provides no

indication of the treatment of the parties.*°

According to the Claimant, the Tribunal found that 3 out of 4 of Spain’s rejected document
requests pertained to matters that were not directly relevant to issues before the Tribunal
as they concerned documents relating to investors and plants that were neither party to nor
otherwise the subject of the arbitration.** As for the remaining request which sought tests
performed for accounting impairment purposes, the Tribunal denied this in light of the

Claimant’s statement that no such tests existed.4

With regard to the Tribunal’s decisions on the intervention of the EC, the Claimant argues
that Spain has adduced no proof of actual bias on the part of Dr. Alexandrov and that it is
difficult to see how a ruling on a third party’s intervention could put in issue the rights of
Spain itself. According to the Claimant, this is dispositive, and Spain’s allegations can be

rejected on this ground alone.*°

In addition, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal’s rejection of the EC’s initial
application was done without prejudice to the Tribunal’s consideration of any application
to intervene by the EC filed at a later stage of the proceedings,*° and that the undertaking
for costs imposed by the Tribunal in respect of the EC’s second application is consistent
with the obligations that the parties to the arbitration themselves have to comply with a

costs award.*°7

(iii) |The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee considers that the Tribunal did not seriously depart from a fundamental
tule of procedure. In the Committee’s view, Spain has failed to establish that there was any
form of bias on the part of Dr. Alexandrov, let alone that Dr. Alexandrov’s transient
involvement as part of the Tribunal deprived Spain of the full, fair and comparatively equal

opportunity to present its case.

306. Atthe outset, it is important to emphasize that Spain accepts that “the award made in SolEs
Badajoz cannot be annulled due to the improper constitution of the tribunal” given that
Dr. Alexandrov resigned from the Tribunal more than two years before the Award was
rendered.*** Instead, Spain’s argument is that Dr. Alexandrov’s involvement contaminated
the procedural decisions of the Tribunal, which is a serious departure of its fundamental

right to be heard.

307. As stated above, the Committee agrees with the Parties that the right to be heard is a
fundamental rule of procedure. As such, the sole issue to be decided is whether the Tribunal
seriously departed from this rule when Dr. Alexandrov was part of the Tribunal. As
explained below, the Committee is not persuaded that there was any serious departure from

a fundamental rule of procedure on this issue.

308. In the first place, the Committee notes that Spain has provided no basis for finding a lack
of impartiality on Dr. Alexandrov’s part in the present case. In fact, Spain does not argue
that there was any actual bias on the part of Dr. Alexandrov. Instead, Spain has sought to
analogize the present case to the Eiser case, where the Eiser committee concluded that
Dr. Alexandrov’s non-disclosure of his relationship with the Claimant’s expert gave rise to

an appearance of bias that should have been disclosed to the Parties.*°°

309. However, the Committee is of the view that the present case is distinguishable from Eiser.
Unlike the Eiser case where Dr. Alexandrov’s relationship with Brattle and Mr. Lapuerta
was only discovered after the award was issued, Spain challenged Dr. Alexandrov in the
course of the Underlying Arbitration which ultimately led to Dr. Alexandrov’s resignation
after the remaining co-arbitrators were divided on the issue. This is different from the Eiser
case where it was found that “Dr. Alexandrov’s absence of disclosure, deprived Spain of
the opportunity to challenge him in the arbitration proceedings” and consequently,
deprived Spain “from seeking the benefit and protection of an independent and impartial

tribunal which the right to challenge is intended to provide” *”°

Moreover, Spain has made no attempt to show that Dr. Alexandrov’s involvement in the
Tribunal caused the Tribunal to reject four of Spain’s document requests, or impose the
undertaking as to costs as a condition of the EC’s intervention in the proceedings. As such,
Spain’s argument that Dr. Alexandrov’s involvement in the Tribunal “contaminated” these

decisions is not supported by positive evidence.

In any case, the specific facts of the two decisions which Spain takes issue with do not
show that Spain was deprived of a full, fair and comparatively equal opportunity to present

its case.

With regard to the decision on documentary production, the Committee is not persuaded
by Spain’s argument that the Tribunal’s allowance of 100% of the requests made by the
Claimant, while only allowing half of Spain’s requests, evidences a deprivation of Spain’s
right to an equal opportunity to present its case. Contrary to Spain’s suggestion that the
“numbers speak for themselves”, the number of document requests allowed by the Tribunal
to one party in comparison to an opposing party cannot be ipso facto a valid ground for

finding a departure from Spain’s right to be heard, let alone a serious one.

On this issue, the Committee agrees with the Claimant’s argument that “one must not
confuse the opportunity to present arguments and evidence — the right to be heard — with
the acceptance of these arguments and evidence — the Tribunal’s discretion”.*”! The
Committee’s function is not to second guess the Tribunal by judging whether its decision
was correct in rejecting the documents sought by Spain. As stated in the Venezuela

Holdings decision:

“[t]he point for decision by the ad hoc Committee in these proceedings
is not, however, whether either side was right or wrong in these
arguments, or indeed whether the Tribunal was right or wrong in
accepting one set of arguments or the other, whether as a matter of law
or as a matter of discretionary assessment. That once again, would
constitute appeal. The only aspect properly for consideration by the
Committee is the possible effect of the Tribunal’s refusal to order
disclosure. Specifically, did that refusal infringe [the respondent’s]

Counter-Memorial on Annulment, 178.

101

314.

315.

316.

317.

right to be heard, or did it at least deny [respondent] a full opportunity

to present its case?” (emphasis added).*”*
In the present case, Spain has not established how the Tribunal’s refusal to order disclosure
prevented it from being able to present its case, let alone how this was done under the
allegedly improper influence of Dr. Alexandrov. Similar to the Venezuela Holdings
decision, the Committee is of the view that there is nothing in the Award which suggests
that the Tribunal’s findings had not been fully and amply argued by the Parties. Moreover,
the Committee also notes that although Spain had more than two years to make an
application for reconsideration of the four document requests after Dr. Alexandrov

resigned from the Tribunal on 24 May 2017, it did not make any such application.

As for the EC’s application to intervene, the Committee also agrees with the Claimant that
it is difficult to see how a ruling on a third party’s intervention could put in issue the rights
of Spain itself. The Committee considers that Spain’s allegations can be rejected on this
ground alone. The fact that the EC decided not to intervene as an amicus curiae because of
the conditions imposed by the Tribunal for its intervention (i.e. the imposition of an
undertaking on costs) is completely distinct from a procedural action affecting Spain’s right

to be heard.

Thus, the Committee concludes that Spain has failed to establish a serious departure from
a fundamental rule of procedure in accordance with Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID

Convention.

B. ‘WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL SERIOUSLY DEPARTED FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE
OF PROCEDURE BY ALLOWING THE CLAIMANT TO ADMIT DOCUMENT C-189 AND
THE GREATREX MATERIALS

ji Spain’s Position

Spain argues that its right of defence was seriously affected when the Tribunal allowed the

Claimant’s request dated 12 April 2018 to admit Document C-189 (i.e. a note from the

CNE dated 22 October 2009) and the Greatrex Materials into the proceedings “just a few

weeks before the hearing” which took place in June 2018 despite Spain’s objections.*”>

Spain relies on Section 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1 dated 22 April 2016 (“2016 PO1”)
which states that “[n]either party shall be permitted to submit additional or responsive
documents after the filing of its respective last written submission, unless the Tribunal
determines that exceptional circumstances exist based on a reasoned written request

followed by observations from the other party”.4”*

With regard to Document C-189, Spain submits that the Tribunal admitted this document
despite the absence of exceptional circumstances of any kind.*’> Spain restates its
objections to the admission of this document which were previously raised to the Tribunal,
namely, that Document C-189 was publicly available since 2009 and that Brattle could
have provided the document with their expert reports in the Underlying Arbitration.*”
According to Spain, the introduction of the document prevented it from formulating written
allegations regarding it, as would have happened had the Claimant respected the procedural

norms and had presented the said document with its memorials.4””

With regard to the Greatrex Materials, Spain similarly argues that the Tribunal did not

justify what exceptional circumstances warranted the introduction of these documents.*”*

According to Spain, it was prevented from analyzing and refuting the documents in its

written memorials, thus violating its right to be heard.*””

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant contends that Spain has not defined the “basic principle of compliance with

procedural deadlines” which it claims has been breached.**”

The Claimant further argues that Spain’s restatement of its original objection that no
exceptional circumstances justified the admission of Document C-189 and the Greatrex
Materials is irrelevant as the Tribunal had already considered both parties’ positions when
it allowed these documents into the record.**! Moreover, the Claimant submits that these
documents were admitted into the record one month before the hearing, and that Spain had
addressed these document as well as Mr. Greatrex’s cross examination on the Greatrex

Materials in its Post-Hearing Brief.**”

(iii) |The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee is not persuaded that the admission of Document C-189 and the Greatrex

Materials amounts to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.

In the Committee’s view, this issue can be easily disposed of as it is amply clear from the
record that Spain had a full opportunity to address these documents. Both Document
C-189 and the Greatrex Materials were expressly addressed in Spain’s Post-Hearing Brief,
and Spain even crossed examined Mr. Greatrex on the Greatrex Materials. As such, there
is no basis for Spain’s submission that its right to be heard was infringed in any way and
that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in accordance with

Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.

The Claimant further requests that the Committee order Spain to pay interest at the rate of
1.74% (being the applicable interest rate on all compensation for damages awarded by the
Tribunal) on this amount, from the date of the Committee’s decision until full payment of

the Award, to be compounded quarterly.**°

Cc. THE COMMITTEE’S DECISION ON Costs

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

“In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the

parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in

connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom

those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal

and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.

Such decision shall form part of the award”.
This provision, together with Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) (applied by virtue of Arbitration
Rule 53) gives the Committee discretion to allocate all costs of the proceeding, including

attorney’s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.

The costs of the annulment proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Committee,

ICSID’s administrative fees, and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):

Committee’s fees and expenses US$ 327,351.15

Claimant’s Costs Submissions, 16.

335.

ICSID’s administrative fees US$ 84,000.00

Direct expenses US$ 88,547.89

Total US$ 499,899.04

The above costs have been paid out of the advances on costs made by Spain pursuant to

Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e).**”

In exercising the discretion described above, the Committee notes that both Parties are in
agreement that generally, the Committee should be guided by the principle that “costs
follow the event” unless the circumstances call for a different approach.*** According to
the Claimant, such circumstances must be exceptional. The Committee also notes that both

Parties are in agreement that post-award interest ought to be awarded in the present case.

In the present case, the Committee has by majority decided to reject Spain’s application to
annul the Award in its entirety. The Committee sees no reason to depart from the general
principle that “costs follow the event” which both Parties have relied on. Given that Spain
was not successful on any of the grounds of annulment raised, the Committee considers it
appropriate that Spain should bear the entirety of the Claimant’s costs of this annulment
procedure which amount to EUR 859,927.73. Similarly, Spain should pay the costs of the

proceedings.

Given the Parties’ alignment on the issue of post-award interest, the Committee sees it fit
to allow the Claimant’s request for Spain to pay interest at the rate of 1.74% (being the
applicable interest rate on all compensation for damages awarded by the Tribunal) on this
amount, from the date of the Committee’s decision until full payment of the Award, to be

compounded quarterly.

487 The remaining balance will be reimbursed to Spain.

Accordingly, the Committee, by majority, orders Spain to bear all the costs of the
proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID’s administrative
fees and direct expenses, and pay EUR 859,927.73 to the Claimants in respect of the
Claimants’ legal fees and expenses. The Committee further orders that Spain shall pay
interest to the Claimant on this sum at the rate of 1.74% on this amount, from the date of

the Committee’s decision until full payment of the Award, to be compounded quarterly.
Consistent with his concurring and dissenting views in respect of the damages
determination, a Member of the Committee has issued a separate opinion on this matter
which is attached to this decision.
DECISION
For the reasons set forth above, the Committee by majority decides as follows:

a) Spain’s application for annulment of the Award is rejected in its entirety;

b) the stay of enforcement of Award is terminated;

c) Spain shall bear all the costs of the proceedings, including the fees and expenses of
the Committee, ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses (as reflected in
ICSID’s final financial statement) and pay EUR 859,927.73 to the Claimants in

respect of the Claimants’ legal fees and expenses; and

d

Spain shall pay interest to the Claimant on the sum awarded in subparagraph (c)
above at the rate of 1.74% on this amount, from the date of the Committee’s
decision until full payment of the Award, to be compounded quarterly.
