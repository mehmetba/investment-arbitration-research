OVERVIEW

Mr. John Baldwin and Mr. Shawn Scott, two U.S. entrepreneurs who were experienced
in a number of businesses including gambling facilities, became involved in casinos
and slot machines in Laos in 2007. For this purpose, they caused two companies to be
incorporated in Aruba, the Netherlands Antilles Lao Holdings NV (“LHNV”), and a
subsidiary Sanum Investments (“Sanum”) in Macau (collectively referred to as “the
Claimants”). Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Scott, using various corporate structures partnered
with a Laotian conglomerate (“ST Holdings”) in two casino projects and three slot
machine clubs in Laos positioned near its border with Thailand. One of the casinos,
the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino (“Savan Vegas”), was built and operated
successfully. The second casino, Paksong Vegas Casino (“Paksong Vegas”), was

never built.
Within three years there was a falling out between the Claimants and their local

partners. ST Holdings ceased cooperation with Sanum, initiated litigation against it

and shut Sanum out of Thanaleng, the most profitable of the slot clubs. Mr. John

 

Baldwin testified that ST Holdings was closely connected to leading politicians in the

 

Respondent Government. He said that ST Holdings orchestrated a series of wrongful
Government acts against LHNV which led to the result, designed by the Government,
of driving Sanum out of Laos and appropriating for the Government the wealth created

by the investment and expertise of Mr. Baldwin and his associated companies.

The Claimants initiated arbitrations by LHNV under the bilateral investment treaties
between Laos and the Netherlands,' and by Sanum pursuant to a similar investment
treaty between Laos and Macau (now China).? These arbitrations have consumed
multiple proceedings and years of litigation. Eventually Sanum obtained an award
against ST Holdings from the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) for
over US $200 million. LHNV is not a claimant before this Tribunal, and the Tribunal

does not purport to address its claims. However, much of the evidence of Mr. John

' Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Laos and the Kingdom of the
Netherlands, signed on 16 May 2003, in force since 1 May 2005.

2 Agreement between the Government of. the People's Republic of China and the Government of The Lao People’s

Republic C ing the and Reciprocal Protection of | dated 31 January

1093, as amended on 10 April 2006.

Baldwin is related to both companies, and as he was the directing mind of both
companies, and their principal witness, references will be made to LHNV from time to
time (or collectively to “the Claimants” in the plural) as part of the background to the
disposition of the Sanum claims. Moreover, counsel for the Claimants advised that it
did not withdraw “any factual allegations, as the totality of the facts remain relevant

to certain treaty breaches for which the Claimants will seek relief”?

2. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

4. The Tribunal has issued the following decisions during the proceeding: (i) Award on
Jurisdiction of 13 December 2013; (ii) Interim Ruling on Issues Arising Under the Deed
of Settlement of 19 December 2014 and (iii) Decision on the Merits of the Claimant’s
Second Material Breach Application of 15 December 2017 (“Decision on the Second
Material Breach”). The full procedural history of this case is described in these
decisions. These Decisions, and the Decision on the Second Material Breach, are an

integral part of the Award.

5. The procedural details of this arbitration following the Decision on the Second Material

Breach are summarized below.
6. In the Decision on the Second Material Breach, the Tribunal ruled as follows:

(a) the Second Material Breach Application is allowed;

(b

pursuant to Section 32 of the Settlement, the Treaty arbitration is revived on the
basis jointly and severally of the Government’s breaches of:

(i) Section 8, which promised a “new flat tax”, but instead the Government
imposed a 28% ad valorem tax on gross gaming revenues;

(ii) Section 23, which promised the Claimant relief from “current criminal
investigations,” which nevertheless have been revived;

(c

both of these breaches constitute material breaches that deprived the Claimant of
the intended benefits (or “bargain’”’) promised by each of Section 8 and Section 23;

(d

except as aforesaid, the grounds of revival relied on by the Claimant are rejected;

* Letter dated 26 March 2018 from Claimant to the Tribunal.

-12-
(e) the parties are instructed to confer and propose to the Tribunal a timetable for
the renewed arbitration within 30 days of the date of this decision;

(f) apre-hearing teleconference to resolve any outstanding issues will be held within
45 days of the date of this decision;

the issue of costs is reserved to be dealt with at the conclusion of the hearing on
the merits.

(g

By letter dated 14 January 2018, the Claimant informed the Tribunals of its intention to
propose a timetable for the renewed Treaty arbitrations, as requested by the Tribunals’
Decisions on the Merits of the Claimant’s Second Material Breach Applications of
15 December 2017. By the same letter, the Claimant requested that the Tribunals in
the revived arbitration be set for a merits hearing to take place at a reasonable time after
the scheduled hearing of related but separate proceedings, identified as Lao Holdings
N.V. v. Lao People’s Democratic Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/16/2)/ Sanum
Investments Limited v. Lao People’s Democratic Republic (ICSID Case No.
ADHOC/17/1) (the “BIT II Proceedings”), and proposed an in-person pre-hearing
conference, to explore with the Tribunals how to proceed and to receive any instructions

the Tribunals may have.

By letter dated 18 January 2018, the Respondent objected to the Tribunals’ Interim
Decision on the Claimant’s Second Material Breach Applications. By the same letter,
the Respondent objected to the Claimant’s suggestion that the hearings for the revived
proceedings be delayed until the conclusion of the BIT II Proceedings. The Respondent
proposed a hearing schedule and stated its desire to complete the original disputes as

soon as possible.

By letter dated 26 January 2018, the Claimant provided further comments regarding the
basis for a post-January 2019 hearing.

By letter dated 30 January 2018, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment,
should it wish, on the Claimant’s assertions concerning the matters raised in the letter
dated 26 January 2018. The Respondent provided its response by letter dated 9
February 2018.

On 29 August 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13, on (1) Respondent’s
request to strike from the record Mr. William Greenlee’s witness statements;
(2) Respondent’s request to introduce exhibits SRE-164 and SRE-165; (3) Claimant’s
request to extend the time assigned at the hearing; (4) Claimant’s request to exclude the
BDO Report submitted by the Respondent, and (5) Claimant’s request for advance
notice for witness examination. These issues were decided as follows:
“1, The Respondent’s request to strike from the record Mr. William
Greenlee’s witness statements is premature.

2. Exhibits SRE-164 and SRE-165 are to be admitted into evidence.

3. Each party shall have equal time and is to determine the order in
which its own cross-examinations proceed as well as time allocation.

4. The Claimants’ request to exclude from the record the 291
additional pages attached to the BDO Report contained in Exhibit SRE-
161 is granted.

5. The Parties are not required to provide advance notice of topics to
be covered in cross-examination.”
By letter of the same date, the Tribunal requested the Parties to confer and provide to

the Tribunal a final hearing schedule.

On 30 August 2018, the Claimant submitted the Parties’ final and agreed hearing

schedule.

A hearing on the merits was held at Maxwell Chambers in Singapore, from 3 to 7
September 2018 (the “Hearing”). As on previous occasions, the Tribunal conducted

the hearing jointly with the Tribunal in the ICSID Proceedings. At no time were the

62. As mentioned earlier, LHNV, owned directly and indirectly through its subsidiary,
Sanum, gambling assets in Laos, including the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino Complex
in Savannakhet Province. The Casino is strategically located near the Friendship
Bridge which spans the Mekong River between Laos and Thailand. The Claimants also
had an investment in “slot clubs” located at the Thai border at Lao Bao and Savannakhet
Ferry Terminal (located at the Savannakhet/Mukdahan checkpoint), all in the
Savannakhet Province and at Thanaleng to the Northwest. LHNV and its subsidiary

Sanum, claim to have invested many millions of dollars in these projects.

“The Claimants’ principal, Mr. John Baldwin, testified as follows:
Q. ... Can you tell us when Sanum first invested in Laos and what kind of money it invested, at what
time period?
A. We — we started investing in Laos in 2007. Our initial commitment was a total of seven and a half
million dollars — my recollection is seven and a half million dollars paid to ST Group in various
stages, and then the next thing we invested in was getting new plans drawn and studies done for
Savan Vegas and Paksong Vegas.
Q. And in what year was that done?
A. That was done in 2008 primarily.
Q. When was the first monies paid? 2007 or 2008?
A. First monies, 2007.

3.2. The Original Treaty Claims

The Claimants allege expropriation without compensation and Treaty breaches in
respect of their investment in gambling projects described in the Project Development
Agreement (“PDA”) dated 10 August 2007 in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino, as
well as the three slot clubs, Thanaleng, Lao Bao and Savannakhet Ferry. The claims
also relate to the expected expansion of the Savannakhet Airport and opportunities for

development in the Special Economic Zone at Thakhet.

On 14 August 2012, Sanum Investments Limited, a LHNV subsidiary which operated
the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino, initiated its claim before the PCA for alleged
violations of the Agreement between the Government of the People’s Republic of China
and the Government of The Lao People’s Democratic Republic Concerning The
Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, dated 31 January 1993 and

the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as revised in 2010.

Also on 14 August 2012, LHNV initiated its ICSID proceedings against the
Respondent, before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(“ICSID” or the “Centre’) pursuant to the Agreement on Encouragement and
Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Laos and the Kingdom of the
Netherlands,> and the Arbitration Rules (Additional Facility) of ICSID (“ICSID-AF
Rules”).6

While the proceedings before the two Tribunals are distinct and separate, the
proceedings were the subject of joint hearings in Singapore and elsewhere.
Accordingly, for ease of reference only, LHNV and Sanum will be referred to as "the

Claimants", as the facts of the cases are intermingled. This terminology is not to

Q. And then the money that was in 2008, can you say during roughly what month?
A. Well, the largest amount of money was paid prior to the Savan — was paid in probably the last six
months of 2008.

Q. During all of that time in 2007 and 2008, did you have a flat tax agreement yet?

A. Yes.

Q. Prior — let me show you some documents. Let me show you —

A. Well, we had an agreement to get the flat tax agreement. The flat tax was approved — the flat tax
was approved by Prime Minister Bouasone in [29 December 2008].

suggest, however, that the two arbitral proceedings are consolidated or otherwise

conjoined.

3.3. Claims and Counterclaims

The Claimants’ original Treaty claims were based on a multiplicity of alleged treaty
breaches by the Government including (but not limited to) an 80% tax on casino
revenues and what the Claimants contended were unfair and oppressive audits of the
Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino. In addition, the Claimants alleged that the Government
abused its sovereign authority to assist ST Holdings to acquire other assets which
belonged in whole or in part, to the Claimants. In the Treaty proceedings, the Claimants
eventually valued their investment loss as of 31 August 2016 at between

US $690 million and US $1 billion.”

3.4. The Settlement and its Aftermath

The Treaty claims were thought to have been resolved by a Deed of Settlement
concluded between the Parties during the merits hearing in Singapore on 15 June 2014
(to be read together with a Side Letter dated 18 June 2014) (herein referred to

collectively as “the Settlement”).

Shortly after the Settlement, the Claimants alleged that the Government had committed
a material breach of its terms which entitled them to a revival of the Treaty arbitrations
(“the First Material Breach Application”). The Government contested jurisdiction.
On 11 August 2014, the Government filed a Notice of Arbitration with the SIAC
pursuant to paragraphs 35 and 42 of the Settlement, seeking an order directing Sanum

to comply with its obligations under the Settlement.

The ICSID and PCA Tribunals held a hearing on 14 October 2014 in Washington, D.C.
on the objections to jurisdiction, which were dismissed. However, on 20 January 2015,
the High Court of the Republic of Singapore held that the PCA Tribunal did not possess
subject matter jurisdiction under the Laos-China BIT because of the status of Macau

and issues of state succession not here relevant, as well as the limitation in the BIT,

according to which “only disputes over the amount of compensation for expropriation
can be submitted to arbitration.”® This judgment was later reversed by the Court of

Appeal of Singapore on 29 September 2016.9

3.5. Delimitation of the Relief Presently Sought by the Claimants

The Claimants’ Second Material Breach Application was successful, and on
15 December 2017, the Hearing on the merits of the “revived” claim was ordered to
proceed. On 26 March 2018, the Claimants advised the Tribunal of the claims for which
they no longer sought relief, namely, in respect of the PCA proceedings, “Article 6
expropriation claim regarding the [Savan Vegas], its Article 6 expropriation claim
regarding Ferry Terminal or Lao Bao slot clubs [...], or its claims regarding

Respondent’s seizure of its bank account in breach of Articles 3(2), 3(4), 4, 5, and 6.”!"

The Claimants’ letter of 26 March 2018 notionally divided and separated their claims
concerning LHNV (Thanaleng, Savan Vegas and the Ferry Terminal and Lao Bao slots)
and Sanum (Thanaleng, Paksan, Thakhet and Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino). As
mentioned, however, counsel for the Claimants asserted in the same letter that “the
totality of the facts remain relevant to certain treaty breaches for which the Claimants
will seek relief.” Equally, the Respondent conjoined its “clean hands” defence to all
claims by both Claimants at issue in the ICSID and PCA proceedings involving Mr.
John Baldwin and the various interrelated allegations of bribery and corruption.
Accordingly, it will be necessary for the Tribunal to address “the totality” of the factual
circumstances of the listed projects of both Claimants insofar as they are relevant to the

position of Sanum.

Sanum maintained the expropriation claim pursuant to Article 4 of the Treaty regarding the

Thanaleng slot club, Paksan, Thakhet and the Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino.

4. RELEVANT ARTICLES OF THE BIT

74. The Preamble to the Treaty provides, in relevant part:

The Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of
the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (hereinafter referred to as Contracting
States), Desiring to encourage, protect and create favorable conditions for

paragraph 1 of this Article, it may be submitted at the request of either party
to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply
if the investor concerned has resorted to the procedure specified in the
paragraph 2 of this Article.

OTHER MATTERS
5.1. Other Legal Provisions

The Respondent argues that, in addition to the BIT, domestic law is relevant to the
existence of the Claimants’ contractual rights and the legality of the conduct of the
foreign investors. Furthermore, there are international norms such as “[t]he United
Nations Convention Against Corruption which defines bribery and money laundering
as fundamental criminal offenses that undermine the international system of foreign
trade.”!! It is the contention of the Respondent that the Claimants violated the BIT, the

laws of Laos and international norms.

According to the Claimant Sanum’s Reply, the “[BIT] clearly governs this dispute.”!?
The United Nations Convention Against Corruption (“UNCAC”) “creates obligations

only for the state Parties, to develop anti-corruption policies, practices, and task forces.

It does not bind or purport to bind the conduct of entities such as the Claimant.”!? The
Claimants also question the Respondent’s appeal to international public policy and, in
particular, the international standard for the gaming industry based on domestic gaming
regulations of just four jurisdictions, none of them applicable to the Claimants’ projects

in Laos.

While the Claimants admit that domestic statutes obviously do determine whether
certain alleged acts are legal or illegal for the purposes of domestic law, domestic law

does not dictate the consequences for an investor’s claims under the Treaty.

The Claimants argue that “once an investor has established its investment in conformity
with the host state’s laws, that investment falls within the scope of the treaty (assuming
all of the other jurisdictional hurdles have been cleared), and the investor is prima facie
entitled to its protections.”'* The Claimants further argue that the cases that “consider
whether allegations of misconduct constitute a proper defence on the merits do not
assist Laos because tribunals have required Respondents to demonstrate that the actions

taken in breach of the treaty were actually justified by the misconduct.”!5

The Claimants also dispute the relevance of the “uncontroversial proposition that
arbitral tribunals have an inherent power to preserve the integrity of their own process
...”!6 The Claimants equally reject the applicability of the “unclean hands” doctrine
and note that the Respondent has not cited any case in which a tribunal has sanctioned

post-investment behaviour with a full dismissal of the Claimant’s case.

5.2. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The law to be applied by the Tribunal is determined by the Treaty. The Treaty is an
international instrument that to the extent it requires interpretation will be interpreted
by the Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law
of the Treaties (“WCLT”) to which both State parties to the Treaty have acceded. As

the Parties admit in their exchanges, the domestic law of the State may also be relevant.

-29-

The extent of its relevance is a matter of dispute between the Parties, particularly on the
question of whether to be protected an investment needs to be made and operated
according to the law of the host State. This issue and the disputed applicability of
international policy relate to the defence of illegal conduct and the Tribunal will address

both matters as needed in its consideration of the Respondent’s defence.

5.3. Clarification on the Nature of the Respondent’s Illegality Claims

As part of its defence, the Respondent has pleaded that the Tribunal should dismiss all
claims because of the illegal activities in which the Claimants allegedly engaged,
including bribery, embezzlement and money laundering. The Claimants have at times
characterized this defence as a “request for dismissal... for lack of jurisdiction” because

at inception or in its operation the investment of the Claimants was illegal.!7

As the Tribunal understands it, the present submission of the Respondent to dismiss all
claims on grounds of illegality is not an objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, but an
affirmation of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to consider the claims on their merits which,

the Government says, ought to be dismissed because of the Claimants’ illegal conduct.

THE RESPONDENT’S THRESHOLD POSITION IS THAT THE CLAIMS
OUGHT NOT TO BE ENTERTAINED BY REASON OF THE CLAIMANTS’
BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION

At the threshold of its argument, the Respondent contends that the claims should be
dismissed in their entirety, in part because of corruption in the creation of the investments,
and in part because of corruption in the course of performance of the various PDAs and

unsuct

  

ful initiatives by the Claimants to obtain licences for new gambling facilities.

The Respondent alleges that the principals behind the Claimants, Mr. John Baldwin and
Mr. Sean Scott, were quite brazen about how to do business in a culture of corruption.
However, Mr. Baldwin says, they steadfastly resisted. In this respect, Mr. Baldwin
testified that:

 

Laos can be quite a corrupt country ... As I met fellow busin en in Laos,
I came to realize that almost every major business operating in Laos has paid

7 Claimant’s Reply, para. 13.

-30-

money under the table for their concessions, or their flat tax agreements or
other Government approvals. Sanum, however, has not.'*
90. In his re-examination at the Hearing, Mr. John Baldwin made an even more emphatic
denial of corrupt activities: “I gave strict instructions always that we weren’t paying
any bribes.”!°

91. The allegations of bribery in the course of making the initial investment include:

(a) an alleged bribe of US $30,000 to Laotian tax authorities to obtain approval of
the original 2009 Flat Tax Agreement which the Claimants regarded as essential

to their investment in their flagship Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino project;

(b) payment of US $25,000 to Government officials to procure a licence for the
Claimants’ proposed Thakhaek Slot Club and Welcome Centre.?°

92. The allegations of bribery in the course of performance of the PDAs and related

tives include:

 

(a) payment of US $875,000 to the Claimants’ consultant in the Laos private sector,
Madam Sengkeo Phimmasone, to bribe Government officials to stop an audit by
Ernst & Young (“E&Y”) of Savan Vegas in order to avoid disclosure of the
Claimants’ illegal activity*! and witness tampering (Madam Sengkeo
Phimmasone refused to make herself available to testify in these proceedings.

The Respondent alleges she was paid by the Claimants to stay away);

'S John Baldwin Second Witness Statement dated 9 May 2014, para. 5.

'° Mr. Baldwin testified as follows in re-examination by his counsel:
Q. Mr. Branson asked you a number of questions about the contracts, the consulting contracts, that Mr.
Bouker had that Marty Gersten had written up and you said you hadn’t seen them, but now that you’ ve
seen them, do they cause you to believe that Mr. Bouker was being dispatched to go and bribe people?
A.No.
Q. And why is that?
A, Well, first and foremost, I gave strict instructions always that we weren’t paying any bribes.
That’s number one. I just don’t do it and I’m a stubborn guy and I just don’t — I tell my staff the
same thing always, you know, it’s a slippery slope and you can’t start down it, so that’s number one.
But number two is, you know, fair value [in terms of a success fee] for result for work given, I mean,
if he [Mr. Bowker] has the contacts to do this, more power to him. (emphasis added)

officials for a Cambodian lottery licence, bribed Cambodian officials to obtain
Cambodian diplomatic passports and bribed Cambodian customs officials to ignore
unlawful border crossings. These allegations were designed to demonstrate that the
principals of the Claimants are “bad people” with a predisposition to use bribery and

corruption to advance their financial interests. The facts underlying the Cambodian

allegations are so far removed from the allegations of corruption in Laos, that the

allegations relating to Cambodia will not be considered further.

6.1. Evidence of Bribery and Corruption is Relevant Both at the Time of Investment
and During Subsequent Performance

94. The Parties agree that investment tribunals are rightly sensitive to allegations of
corruption. They agree that the Respondent bears the burden of proof. They disagree
on the standard of proof, i.e. whether a balance of probabilities is sufficient or whether
corruption must be established to the more demanding standard of “clear and

convincing evidence” of corruption. They also, of course, disagree on the facts.

95. There is no doubt that bribery and corruption are contrary to the domestic laws of

Laos.”?

6.1.1. The Respondent’s Argument

96. The Respondent asserts that the Claimants are not legally entitled to maintain any of
their claims in these proceedings as a matter of ordre public international and public

policy.° Corruption, the Respondent argues, is relevant to the initial investment but

also to the investor’s subsequent conduct in relation to the investment in the host

country.*!

97. The difference is that corruption in the making of the investment will raise issues of
jurisdiction for the Tribunal, whereas subsequent acts of corruption will go to a

claimant’s entitlement for relief under the BIT?
98. In particular, the Respondent relies on the analysis in Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan:

While reaching the conclusion that the claims are barred as a result of
corruption, the Tribunal is sensitive to the ongoing debate that findings on
corruption often come down heavily on claimants, while possibly exonerating
defendants that may have themselves been involved in the corrupt acts. It is
true that the outcome in cases of corruption often appears unsatisfactory
because, at first sight at least, it seems to give an unfair advantage to the
defendant party. The idea, however, is not to punish one party at the cost of
the other, but rather to ensure the promotion of the rule of law, which entails
that a court or tribunal cannot grant assistance to a party that has engaged in
acorrupt act. (emphasis added)

99. The Respondent also relies, more generally, on the doctrine of “clean hands”. The
Claimants’ misconduct is sufficient, it is said, to deny them the assistance of investor-

state arbitration.

31. The approach to bribery is different in investment arbitrations, where jurisdiction does not derive
from a contract, but rather from an investment treaty. In these cases, validity of contracts is not the
question. The issue is whether an investor who has incurred in corrupt practices when making or
performing the investment can still enjoy protection under the relevant investment treaty. And the
answer is no. (38) Investment arbitration has initiated and led the movement of zero tolerance
towards corruption.

state, allegations by the host state of violations of its law in the course of the investment, as a

violations of the BIT, but could not deprive a tribunal acting under the authority of the BIT of its

6.1.2. The Claimant’s Argument

100. The Claimants point out that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is founded on the BIT and
neither the Netherlands nor the Chinese BIT contains a provision authorizing a tribunal
to deny the treaty’s protection on the basis that the claimant/investor engaged in
corruption. If the BITs provide no authority to dismiss, the Tribunal would have to
base its decision on customary international law. However, the lack of “clean hands”
is neither a recognized rule of customary international law nor a general principle of

international law and thus affords no authority to dismiss.**

101. The Claimants acknowledge that corruption in the establishment of an investment
can render a claim inadmissible because treaty protections are only available for valid
investments recognized under the treaty (based upon either an explicit or implied
legality requirement).*> The Claimants deny corruption but in any event deny any
causal connection between the acts of alleged corruption and these claims. The
Respondent only concocted its corruption allegations after the arbitrations were
commenced and in any event has failed to govern itself in a manner consistent with its
international obligations, including due process and good faith, and the prosecution of

bribe-takers as well as alleged bribe-givers.*©

102. The Claimants’ principal, Mr. John Baldwin, denied the applicability of the “red flags”

approach to the investments in issue here:

Q. Is it possible that when you enter into a consulting contract like this, that
if the event is achieved, the consultant is sent the money and the consultant
then is instructed to pay it to certain government ministers so that it keeps the
company one step removed from proof of the bribe? Isn’t that how it works,
Mr Baldwin?

A. That’s a possibility, although it didn’t happen here.”

6.1.3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

103. The Tribunal considers that proof of corruption at any stage of the investment may be
relevant depending on the circumstances. While the UNCAC applies to States rather
than private parties, it embodies what has become a principle of customary international
law applicable, according to the OECD, to root out corruption used “to obtain or retain
business or other undue advantage in relation to the conduct of international
business.”

104. The Respondent also relies on a generalized doctrine of “clean hands” which is a
metaphor employed as a defence to equitable relief in common law jurisdictions.
Incorporation of such a general doctrine into investor-State law without careful
boundaries would risk opening investment disputes to an open-ended, vague and
ultimately unmanageable principle. However, putting aside the label, serious financial
misconduct by the Claimants incompatible with their good faith obligations as investors
in the host country (such as criminality in defrauding the host Government in respect
of an investment) is not without Treaty consequences, both in relation to their attempt
to rely on the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment, as well as their entitlement to

relief of any kind from an international tribunal.

38 UN Convention Against Corruption, Article 16(1), LHRA-16. See also OECD Convention on Combating
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, Article 1(1), Exhibit LHRA-136:
Each Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish that it is a criminal offence
under its law for any person intentionally to offer, promise or give any undue pecuniary or other
advantage, whether directly or through intermediaries, to a foreign public official, for that official or
for a third party, in order that the official act or refrain from acting in relation to the performance of
official duties, in order to obtain or retain business or other improper advantage in the conduct of
international business. (emphasis added) .

 

See also ICC Dossier: Addressing Issues of Corruption in Commercial and Investment Arbitration, Chapter 11,
at para. 34, Exhibit LHRA-155:
It is now undisputed that a finding of corruption when making or performing an investment will lead
to dismissal of claimant’s claims and to a loss of any protection afforded by the treaty. (emphasis
added)

6.2. The Applicable Standard of Proof
6.2.1. The Respondent’s Argument

105. The Respondent notes that many international tribunals have recognized the difficulty
of “proving” bribery and corruption. In the nature of things, the parties to such
transactions are generally careful to leave no paper trail or other direct or documentary
evidence. As a result, if corruption is to be combatted effectively, it is necessary to rely
on inferences from circumstantial evidence. A reasonable approach is to identify “red

flags” which, if established, require the alleged perpetrators to provide an exculpatory

 

explanation of otherwise suspicious conduct. In Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan,® for

example, the tribunal considered probative of corruption the Government’s evidence of

substantial payments to a consultant where:
(a) the consultant lacks experience in the sector,
(b) the consultant is not a resident of the country where the project is located;

(c) the consultant has no significant business presence or experience within the

country;

(d

the consultant requests “urgent” payments and/or unusually high commissions;

(e

the consultant requests payments be made in cash, be made in a third country, to
a numbered bank account, or to some other person or entity than the one with

whom the agreement was signed;

(f) the consultant has a close personal/professional relationship to the Government

that could improperly influence the decision.”

6.2.2. The Claimant’s Argument

The Claimants contend that the applicable standard of proof of corruption in
international law is “clear and convincing evidence” which must consist of
“substantial facts” not mere “inferences”.*! Relevance is placed on Waguih Elie
George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. The Arab Republic of Egypt, where the tribunal
held that “the applicable standard of proof is greater than the balance of probabilities
but less than beyond a reasonable doubt.” The term favoured by the Claimants is “clear

and convincing evidence.”*”

6.2.3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal acknowledges the difficulty of proving corruption as well as the
importance of exposing corruption where it exists. In the nature of the offence, the
person offering the bribe and the person accepting it will take care to cover their
tracks. Nevertheless, given the seriousness of the charge, and the severity of the
consequences to the individuals concerned, procedural fairness requires that there be
proof rather than conjecture. The standard of “probabilities” requires the trier of fact
to stand back and make an overall assessment. The requirement of “clear and
convincing” evidence puts the focus more closely on the building blocks of the

evidence to ensure a rigorous testing.

In the Tribunal’s view, there need not be “clear and convincing evidence” on every
element of every allegation of corruption, but such “clear and convincing evidence”

as exists must point clearly to corruption. An assessment must then be made of which

“! Liman Caspian Oil BV and NCL Dutch Investment BV v. Republic of Kazakhstan, CSD Case No. ARB/O7/14,
Award, 22 June 2010, Exhibit CLA(B)-441, at para. 424:

... Itis not sufficient to present evidence which could possibly indicate that there might have been or
even probably was corruption. Rather Claimants have to prove corruption...{T]he issue is not one
of inference, and the Tribunal considers that Claimants have not met their burden of proof in this
regard.

elements of the alleged act of corruption have been established by clear and
convincing evidence, and which elements are left to reasonable inference, and on the
whole whether the alleged act of corruption is established to a standard higher than
the balance of probabilities but less than the criminal standard of beyond reasonable
doubt, although, of course proof beyond reasonable doubt would be conclusive. This
approach reflects the general proposition that the “graver the charge, the more

confidence there must be in the evidence relied on.”

6.3. Failure of the Respondent to Investigate and Prosecute Persons who Allegedly
Accepted Bribes

As the Claimants point out, the Respondent has brought no prosecutions against any
Government official said to be on the receiving end of the bribes. Nor is there before the
Tribunal any evidence of a serious criminal investigation of anyone other than the

principals of the Claimant, Mr. John Baldwin and Mr. Sean Scott.

Conviction of its own officials would not estop the Government from pursuing the

Claimants as bribe-givers.

However, in this case, the Tribunal finds it disturbing that no prosecutions have been
brought against any persons alleged to have accepted bribes, nor has there been evidence
of due diligence in any investigation. These omissions are relevant to the credibility of the

Government’s allegations, as will be seen.
6.3.1. First Allegation — Bribes to Obtain the 2009 Flat Tax Agreement
6.3.1.1. The Respondent’s Argument

The Claimants have repeatedly acknowledged that the Flat Tax Agreement (“FTA”)*4
was essential to the economic profitability of Savan Vegas. Mr. John Baldwin testified

in Singapore that the Claimants would not have built the casino without an FTA:

43 See Libananco v. Turkey (Exh. RLA-117), para. 125; Rompetrol v. Romania (Exh. RLA-233), para. 182;
both relying on the Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in the Oil Platforms case, ICJ Reports 1996, at 856.
“Flat Tax Agreement between Laos and Savan Vegas, dated 21 September 2009, Exhibit C(B)-007.

-39-

Q. And would you have built the Savan Vegas casino for $25 million, $30
million if that was the tax you had to pay, if the government refused to give

you a flat tax agreement?

A. No.*

113. It is alleged that to obtain the original 2009 FTA, a bribe of US $30,000 was paid to

Ms. Manivone or Mr. Khamphai, senior officials with the Government tax department,

through the Claimants’ intermediary or consultant, Madam Sengkeo.

114. The FTA was of great value to the Claimants as it limited most types of tax to a flat sum

of US $745,000 per year regardless of the profits made by the multi-million dollar casino

operation.
115. The chronology is as follows:

According to the Respondent, the sequence of dates, and the use of the daughter’s bank

account in lieu of Madam Sengkeo’s own account, raise “red flags”.

While the FTA had been agreed to in principle in December 2008, Mr. John Baldwin
testified that the deal was not done, because “we needed to get the flat tax agreement
reduced into a formal document at that specific time.”*° Accordingly, it would have
been quite understandable for the payment of a bribe to be delayed until October 2009
when the FTA was signed, as opposed to December 2008 when it was purportedly

approved in principle by the Government.

In cross-examination, Mr. John Baldwin denied any illegal payment to Madam
Sengkeo, but according to the Respondent, Mr. Baldwin’s explanation that the
reference to payment in October 2009 of US $30,000 to the “tax people” meant
payment to Madam Sengkeo for her own benefit rather than as a bribe for tax officials
is (according to the Respondent) manifestly absurd. In this respect, Mr. John Baldwin

testified as follows:

Q. Isn’t this a statement to the CFO of Sanum/Savan Vegas to pay a bribe of
$30,000 to a tax official in the Ministry of Finance?

A. No.

Q. How do you interpret it? What does it mean?

A. That the $30,000 success fee was supposed to be paid to Madam Sengkeo
and her tax people that were with her.

Q. She is “the Tax people”?

A. Yes.

Q. Did she work for the government then?

A. No.

Q. She didn’t? She’s not an employee of the Ministry of Finance?

*° Mr. John Baldwin testified as follows:

Q. What was the agreement’s substance? I mean, the agreement with Madam Sengkeo, what was the
substance of that agreement?

A. I believe — I — I don’t know specifically, but I believe that we needed to get the flat tax agreement
reduced into a formal document at that specific time, but Madam Sengkeo’s engagement went back
nearly a year, is my recollection, and that she helped, through that whole period, to get the flat tax
agreement.

Q. What was the agreement? Why was she getting 30,000? Why not 50,000?

A. Well, she agreed to take $30,000.

Amended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p.69, 16-25 to 70, 1-3.

-41-

A. No."

119. The Respondent adds that the US $30,000 may have gone to Madam Sengkeo in the

first instance, but in the Respondent’s view, the coincidence of timing with Sanum’s

apparent need to ingratiate itself with Government officials is fatal to Mr. Baldwin’s

credibility.

6.3.1.2. The Claimant’s Argument

120. The Claimant contends that payment of US $30,000 to Madam Sengkeo was a “success

fee” for obtaining the FTA where previous intermediaries had failed.** Mr. Baldwin

strongly denied any impropriety:

Q. Down at the bottom of the page it says:

“Dear Billy and Team, Mr Khamphai of the Tax Department and Mdm
Sengkeo had just informed us that Joe had picked up the flat tax document at
his office [meaning Mr Khamphai’s] since 9AM this morning ...

However, he has asked us to wire the agreed payment to Madam Sengkeo’s
account as followed ...”

And then they give the account number. So isn’t this interesting, that the day
that the flat tax agreement is delivered to your employee, he asked that
$30,000 is wired that day?

A. Well, my reading of this is that “he” is Joe.
Q. And who is he saying that the money should be paid to?
A. Madam Sengkeo.** (emphasis added)

5! Amended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 66, 1-15.
© Mr. Baldwin testified in his Second Witness Statement in the SIAC case of 8 June 2015 as follows:

15. The Government alleges that I authorized payments totaling US$30,000 to Madame Sengkeo
Phimmasone, as a bribe to obtain the flat tax agreement issued on 1 September 2009 for Savan Vegas.
This too is false. The payments represented a success fee to Madam Sengkeo for her efforts to
help Savan Vegas negotiate a Flat Tax Agreement with the Lao Government — a project on which

she had worked since at least July 2008.

16. Initially, it was the ST Group — then our local partner in Laos — that was responsible for obtaining
a flat tax agreement for Savan Vegas. However, it failed to do so, thus by mid-2008, we took it upon
ourselves to negotiate such an agreement with the Lao Government. In order to have local Lao
expertise to assist us, Savan Vegas offered a success fee to Madam Sengkeo to lobby for a
satisfactory Flat Tax Agreement for Savan Vegas. Madam Sengkeo was a partner of ST, which is
how I came to know her. I discovered that she had many high-level connections in the Lao

Government. This made her a natural choice for this consulting engagement. (emphasis added)

Mr. John Baldwin testified that there was no reason to bribe any Government employee
in September 2009 as the Prime Minister had already agreed to a flat tax agreement in
December 2008.*4

6.3.1.3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Respondent’s case is speculative rather than substantial. Madam Sengkeo was in
the consulting business. Consultants are paid. While the Claimants never produced a
“consulting agreement” with Madam Sengkeo, the evidence is that it is not unusual for
consultants to insist on a success fee as part of their remuneration. The effort to obtain
a FTA was successful. It was likely worth millions of dollars to the Claimants in
reduced taxes. In that context, payment of US $30,000 in 2009 is not a disproportionate
“success fee”. Moreover, no one was prosecuted in this affair. Even if Madam Sengkeo
did not cooperate with the Government, why was her daughter (the owner of the bank
account) not investigated? What is the daughter’s explanation? The evidence of
corruption in this instance is neither clear nor convincing. The bribery allegation in
connection with the FTA is not established to the necessary standard for such a serious

charge.

6.3.2. Second Allegation — Bribes to Extend the Flat Tax Agreement After
Expiry of the 5-Year Term

6.3.2.1. The Respondent’s Argument

On 18 March 2011, Savan Vegas submitted its proposal to extend the FTA, which was
due to expire on 31 December 2014. Six days later, on 24 March 2011, the Claimants
paid US $21,000 to Mr. Bouker Noutharath, a retired hospital worker from Olympia,
Washington State, United States of America, who had returned to live in Laos. He had

no experience as a “consultant” but had good contacts within the Government. On

™4 Mr. Baldwin testified:

Q. Would there be any reason to have to bribe anyone when the Prime Minister had already approved
your flat tax?

A. You know, there’s no reason to and, plus, obviously, the Prime Minister’s office was watching
this. The local tax people were watching this, the finance department’s watching this. This was a
significant project and lots of people were watching it and there’s no way. You just wouldn’t —
couldn’t happen.

-43-

4 March 2011, he was retained by Savan Vegas* as a consultant to lobby in favour of
an extension of the FTA. Mr. Baldwin says Mr. Bouker was promised a success fee
substantially in excess of US $ 21,000, but Mr. Bouker, who agreed to cooperate with

the Government, testified that:

I have seen the entry in the general ledger that I was sent $21,000 on March
24,2011. The entry says “prof fee re flat tax acceptance — Brian Nonthavet.”
RE-131. I remember that Sanum was concerned about extending a flat tax
agreement, but I was not involved in that issue. I was sent the $21,000 to
deliver it to a government person. I remember it was Mr. Paoa [of Savan
Vegas] who asked me to make this payment about the tax issue but I cannot
remember the name of the Government person who I gave this payment
too. (emphasis added)

These contracts are for fraud reasons. They were drafted and sent to me by
lawyer Martin Gersten ... They were to provide a cover for the bribes Sanum
intended to pay to have the Government extend the Flat Tax Agreement and
to obtain the Thakhaek slot club licence.*”

124. The Respondent believes the unidentified “Government Person” was Ms. Manivone,

but Mr. Baldwin testified he was “sure” this was not so:

Q. Do you know that at the time you were negotiating with Madam Manivone
in the tax department of the Ministry of Finance?

6.3.2.2. The Claimant’s Argument

Mr. Bouker received a legitimate consulting mandate. By e-mail dated 21 March 2011,
he requested US $21,000 as “an advance”. His bank records do not show a withdrawal
of US $21,000 but withdrawals of three different amounts on 28 March (US $9,500
cash), 30 March (US $9,000 to his son) and 4 April (US $2,135 cash). Mr. Bouker is a

dissatisfied former employee whose testimony is not credible.
6.3.2.3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

There are inconsistencies in Mr. Bouker’s evidence and it is significant that he can
remember nothing about (or is otherwise unwilling to identify) “the Government
Person” to whom he said he handed US $21,000. There are too many loose ends to his
story. There is no evidence that Madam Manivone (the presumed recipient) or anyone
else was prosecuted. In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent’s evidence does not
establish by clear and convincing evidence or on a balance of probabilities that a

US $21,000 bribe was offered by Mr. Bouker to any Government official as alleged.

6.3.3. Third Allegation — The Claimants Paid US $500,000 in Bribes in 2012 to
(i) Shut Down the E&Y Audit of Savan Vegas and (ii) to Cause the
Government to Shut Down the Thanaleng Slot Club to the Disadvantage
of ST Holdings

On 8 July 2012, Mr. Baldwin wired Sanum’s Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Clay
Crawford, that “Savan has an extraordinary expense of $500,000 this week. I’ve tell

you about it when we speak on the phone, but please think about our cash situation.”*?

Mr. Baldwin accepts that the sum of US $500,000 was subsequently sent to Vientiane
including US $300,000 cash in a backpack delivered to Madam Sengkeo by his personal

assistant, Bruce Douglas.

6.3.3.1. The E&Y Audit

Mr. Baldwin acknowledges ordering Mr. Douglas to fly to Vientiane with US $300,000
in cash. It is established that US $300,000 was subsequently deposited in Madam
Sengkeo’s bank account. She subsequently deposited US $30,000 in her bank account
in New York.

The Respondent’s allegation is that the balance of US $270,000 was paid by Madam
Sengkeo to Government officials to stop the E&Y audit of the Savan Vegas which Mr.
Baldwin considered part of a Government move to get rid of Sanum and take over the

Claimants’ gambling assets without compensation.°!

...“Even those few Government officials who will still speak with me have admitted that we have
been the target of a deliberate campaign to strip Sanum of its investments in Laos. The objective of
these efforts appears to be to leave the successful businesses, in which we invested so much and
which we spent years developing, in the hands of our local commercial partner, the ST Group...and
the senior Lao Government officials who have intimate business and familial connections with ST.”

Madam Sengkeo has not been asked by the Claimants to repay the balance. The
US $30,000 deposit in New York was 10% of the US $300,000 transfer. Madam
Sengkeo was a “ten percenter”, and her receipt of US $30,000 indicates that bribes of
US $270,000 were paid.

132. The bribe succeeded, according to the Respondent. On 12 July 2012, Ernst & Young
(“E&Y”) was ordered by unidentified Government officials to stop work on its audit
of Savan Vegas.** The E&Y audit would have disclosed the Claimants’ illegal
activities (subsequently uncovered by a BDO audit after the Government ousted the
Claimants from the casino) including (the Government alleges) embezzlement and

money laundering.
6.3.3.1.2. The Claimant’s Argument

133. The Claimant says the US $300,000 was a “loan” to Madam Sengkeo. The New York
deposits are unrelated. Madam Sengkeo was closely involved with ST Holdings. There
had been a falling out. She thus had an “urgency” for funds when ST Holdings
malevolently cut off Madam Sengkeo’s regular source of income.® Mr. Baldwin was

a loyal friend.
6.3.3.1.3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

134. Mr. Baldwin’s explanation of the US $300,000 payment to Madam Sengkeo is not
credible. It is clear on the evidence that Mr. Baldwin and his CFO, Mr. Clay Crawford,

were concerned about the threat to Sanum’s business posed by the E&Y audit. Mr.

Letter from Ernst & Young to the Ministry of Finance, Exhibit SRE-53:
In relation to our final report, we also feel it necessary to remind the Inspection Committee that, since
we were instructed by your goodself on 10 July 2012 to cease our fieldwork at Savan Vegas Hotel &
Casino (SVC) and to refrain from receiving any additional information and/or documents from SVC
on the same day, our final report will only contain our preliminary findings and/or observations for
the work performed on documents and information received by us from SVC up till and including 10

Q. What was going on in Vientiane in July 2012 that you needed all that cash there except the
Thanaleng case was happening about 10 days later and the E&Y audit was terminated the day before.
Those are the two events that I can think of that related to Savan Vegas, what can you think of?
A. ST had cut Madame Sengkeo off from any income from their investments, because she had
helped us over him, he had cut her off from any money and she lives primarily on money from
him. She needed money to pay bills on the hotel she was building. The USD 300,000 is a loan
to her. (emphasis added)

Baldwin had every incentive to influence the Government to call off the E&Y audit in
the summer of 2012. It is simply not plausible, as the Claimants argue, that the E&Y
audit was stopped because Government officials had concluded that E&Y had failed to
find incriminating evidence. If that were true, the obvious instructions from the

Government to E&Y would have been to keep digging, not to give up and down tools.

On the other hand, the Claimants had a powerful motive to stop the audit as Mr. Baldwin
and Mr. Crawford knew (and the Government merely suspected) of the existence of
financial skeletons in the Savan Vegas books later uncovered by the BDO audit. All in
all, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants got a senior Government official to stop
the audit and that the $270,000 was paid through Madam Sengkeo (i.e. $300,000 less

10%) to that Government person or persons.

That said, the Tribunal is troubled by the fact that the Government has apparently not
identified any bribe-rakers. The order to E&Y to stop the audit came as a surprise to
E&Y and must have been issued by a senior Government source, otherwise the audit
would have continued. The Respondent does not suggest that E&Y took the bribe but
E&Y must know who gave its auditors the order to stop work. The evidentiary trail
could then have been followed up the chain of command from the Government person
who gave the order to identify the person who authorized the order, who could then have
been required to provide the Government (and subsequently the Tribunal) with an

explanation for the stop work order.

The Respondent has not offered any explanation for this gap in the evidence. In the
circumstances, while the evidence of Mr. Baldwin that Madam Sengkeo required the
funds for her personal use is deeply unsatisfactory, so too is the Government’s apparent
failure even to attempt (so far the evidence is concerned) to get to the bottom of the
matter, not only potentially to punish the wrongdoers, but to provide solid evidence that

a bribe was given and taken by Government official(s) to stop the E&Y audit.

The Tribunal concludes that it is more probable than not that Madam Sengkeo was used
as a conduit to bribe Government officials to stop the E&Y audit, but that this
conclusion is not established to the higher standard of “clear and convincing evidence”.

The Tribunal is satisfied, however, on the lesser standard of a balance of probabilities,

that Mr. Baldwin involved the Claimants in serious financial illegalities in respect of

the halt of the E&Y audit.

6.3.3.2. Payment of About $200,000 in Bribes to Shut Down the
Thanaleng Slot Club

In 2012, the Claimants were experiencing tense relations with their then Laotian
partner, ST Holdings. In part, the tensions related to a profitable slot club at Thanaleng,
which ST Holdings agreed to joint venture with Sanum. The joint venture was to
commence at a future date awaiting the expiry of an earlier arrangement ST Holdings
had contracted with a different slot machine supplier. However, when the date for the

change-over arrived, ST Holdings refused to proceed with its deal with Sanum.

Mr. Baldwin is alleged to have then paid bribes to Government officials through a
“consultant”, Mr. Anousith Thepsimuong, in an effort to shut down the Thanaleng Slot
Club as a pressure tactic to force ST Holdings to negotiate a solution rather than

continue with litigation (which the Claimants ultimately lost in the Laotian Courts).
6.3.3.2.1. The Respondent’s Argument

On 28 July 2012, during the corporate struggle over the Thanaleng Slot Club, the
Claimants attempted to obtain leverage over ST Holdings by bribing Government
Ministries to shut down the Club. The money was channelled through Mr. Anousith.
The sum of US $190,000 was deposited in Mr. Anousith’s bank account on 11 July
2012 and a cash withdrawal of US $100,000 was made the following day.°

Mr. Baldwin testified that Mr. Anousith was paid to lobby “the National Assembly” but
this explanation is not credible. The National Assembly has no executive function.
Only a Government Minister would have operational authority to issue a stop order

against the Thanaleng Slot Club.

Mr. Baldwin acknowledged that he could not explain how or why the National

Assembly would get involved in such an executive action:

°° Extract of ANZ Bank Statement for Mr. Anousith Thepsimoung, Exhibit SRE-153.

-49-

Q. You say that the National Assembly is going to suspend a licence, but did
he [the Deputy Prime Minister] ever explain or did you ever find out how the
National Assembly would actually do that?

A. No.”
6.3.3.2.2. The Claimant’s Argument

144. Mr. John Baldwin readily admits that in July 2012 he was doing what was possible to
get the Government to close the Thangaleng Slot Club®’, including by a written
submission to the country’s President. The Claimants say there is no reason to
disbelieve Mr. Baldwin’s evidence that he was told by the Deputy Prime Minister to
lobby the country’s National Assembly.

145. Mr. Baldwin denied that money was intended for a Government Minister:

Q. See, that brings us back to July and this $500,000 pot of money that we
have sitting in Vientiane in Madam Sengkeo’s bank account — her son-in-
law’s bank account. Isn’t it true that that money was there to stop the court
case from having a judgment — the money was there so you could get the slot
club shut down and negotiate with Mr Sithat?

67 Amended Transcript, 5 September 2018, at p. 9,23-25 to p. 10, 1-4.

°S Mr. Baldwin testified that he wrote to President Choummaly Sayasone requesting the Government to shut down

the Thangaleng Slot Club:
“Sanum asks that the Government suspend that the slot machine licence at the Vientiane Friendship
Bridge. We believe that a temporary suspension will encourage the parties to negotiate and come to
terms so they can work together. Once the parties have reached an agreement, formed a joint venture
that is approved by the relevant ministries, and determine that they can operate the Vientiane...Bridge
Slot Club together, the licence would be reinstated. Until then, Sanum requests your assistance in
suspending the licence and allowing time and space to work [together] towards peace with [the] ST
Group.” Correct? So, as I said, you were trying to get a space to negotiate your way out of this
trouble with ST.
A. Yes.

Amended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 7, 19-25 to p. 8, 1-11.

° In re-examination, Mr. Baldwin testified about the National Assembly as follows:
MS DEITSCH-PEREZ: You spoke with Mr Branson about the Thanaleng lobbying. Can you tell us
where you first got the idea to lobby the assembly with respect to Thanaleng?
A. Yeah. I was having breakfast with Deputy Prime Minister Somsavath — we were having oatmeal
—and he —I said I got— I have to get — make peace with Sithat somehow and I — how do we do it and
he said, you know, it’s a tough row, because, you know, she’s joined at the hip with Bounnhang —
you know, with vice-president Vorachith, Bounnhang Vorachith, and he said I — there’s not very
many people that are going to be able to help you with this, you’ ve got to make peace with Sithat and
Vorachith, so I said, “Well, who can help me do that?”, and he said, “Well, two places — the politburo
and the National Assembly”, and he said the politburo, “That’s difficult, so I would suggest that you
reach out to the National Assembly.”

Amended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 171, 3-22.

A. The money was specifically earmarked to do lobbying with the National
Assembly.

Q. Well, we just established that you have a good friend who is the fourth
most powerful person in the country. Wasn’t the money for him to shut
down the club so you could stop the court decision?

A. No.” (emphasis added)

146. The Claimants argue that there is no evidence that Mr. Anousith paid money to any
Government official. He received fees as a consultant to lobby the National Assembly
to shut down the Thanaleng Slot Club. He was entitled to spend that money as he
wished. Laos is a cash economy. Payment of large amounts of cash in respect of

legitimate transactions is not unusual.’! Cash does not signal illegality.

 

. The Tribunal’s Analysis

147. Once again, the payment to Mr. Anousith is deeply suspicious. There is no
documentation of any consultancy. There is no explanation of the work for which
almost $200,000 were paid to him and deposited in his personal bank account. The
mandate to lobby the “National Assembly” seems far-fetched. Moreover, despite the
alleged payment of bribes, the Thanaleng Slot Club was not shut down. In the
circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to find “clear and convincing evidence” that a
bribe was made or even offered through Mr. Anousith. However, on the lower

“probabilities” standard, the Tribunal concludes that it is more likely than not that a

effort to advance the Claimants’ agenda at the Thanaleng Slot Club.

6.3.4. Fourth Allegation — The Claimants Arranged for a Further $575,000
Bribe to Madam Sengkeo to Prevent Her from Testifying in These
Proceedings

In 2014, when the initial phase of these proceedings was pending, the Government
sought to have Madam Sengkeo testify. To that end, she was provided with a written
assurance of immunity dated 7 May 2014, if she provided “information and documents
related to offering of bribery to government of [sic] official(s) who were performing
accounting audit activities at Savan Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd.”””

At a pre-hearing conference on 14 May 2014, the Claimants (amongst other matters)
applied to the Tribunal to allow Mr. Baldwin to make a “personal loan” to Madam
Sengkeo of US $575,000.” Given the importance and sensitivity of Madam Sengkeo’s
evidence potentially to be given at the merits hearing, the Tribunal declined to give its

permission for a US $575,000 loan to her from Mr. Baldwin.

The initial hearing on the merits proceeded in Singapore in June 2014. Madam Sengkeo

did not attend to testify for the Government.

US $875,000 has been repaid except for US $15,000, leaving US $860,000 not

6.3.4.2. The Claimant’s Argument

152. Mr. Baldwin had a long-standing business relationship with Madam Sengkeo which,
over time, developed into personal friendship. It was perfectly normal for Madam
Sengkeo to seek a personal loan and for Mr. Baldwin to arrange it. There is no evidence
whatsoever that the loan of US $575,000 or any part thereof was intended by Mr.
Baldwin, or understood by Madam Sengkeo,

 

an inducement not to testify. Madam
Sengkeo,”’ who now lives outside Laos, was being improperly pressured by the
Government to give false evidence to support its bribery and corruption case”® and it is
therefore quite understandable that she wished to avoid being a witness. Mr. Baldwin’s
explanation of the loans to Madam Sengkeo is not rebutted and there is no evidence

inconsistent with his version of events.

6.3.4.3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

153. The US $575,000 loan, coming on top of the previous loan of US $300,000, of which
only US $15,000 were repaid bristles with “red flags”. Mr. Baldwin clearly intended
to sidestep the Tribunal’s denial of permission by arranging for the US $575,000 loan
from a third party. Given Madam Sengkeo’s central role in dealings between the
Claimants and the Government over many years, her testimony would have shed crucial
light on the legality or illegality of many of the disbursements at issue in the

Respondent’s allegations.
154. Mr. John Baldwin testified:

Q. So when Mdm Sengkeo withdrew US$80,000 in cash on July 20, the
day before you went to visit your good friend, the Deputy Prime Minister,
what do you think she was going to do with those US dollars?

A. It was Mdm Sengkeo’s money to do what she wanted. She represented to

me that she needed the loan to pay construction bills.” (emphasis added)
155. It cannot be said that the bare payment of US $875,000 to Madam Sengkeo is “clear
and convincing evidence” of bribery. There is no evidence to contradict Mr. Baldwin’s
evidence of her need for funds. There are other possible explanations for their

disbursement.

156. On the whole, however, while the Tribunal is unable to find “clear and convincing
evidence” that the money was paid to Madam Sengkeo to bribe Government Ministers,
the Tribunal is nevertheless satisfied on the lower standard of balance of probabilities
that Mr. Baldwin and Madam Sengkeo were involved in channeling funds illicitly to
Lao Government officials, and further that she was paid to secure her loyalty and to

avoid her testifying on behalf of the Government, thereby obstructing justice.

157. The coincidence of the timing of “loans” of US $875,000 (less one repayment of
US $15,000) to Madam Sengkeo and the Claimants’ urgent need for Government
intervention on its behalf at critical junctures of its business (the termination of the E&Y
audit and the attempt to shut down the Thanaleng Slot Club), together with Madam

Sengkeo’s role as the Claimants’ principal go-between with the Government, which

Mr. Baldwin describes as a corrupt Government, compels an inference of Mr.
Baldwin’s unlawful conduct and through Mr. Baldwin, the culpability and bad faith of
both LHNV and Sanum, on whose behalf he acted.

The Government’s failure to track down bribe-takers or to provide a convincing
explanation of its efforts (even if on occasion unsuccessful) to do so, weighs against
the Government’s case, although the fact that the key witness, Madam Sengkeo, herself

refused to cooperate made the Government’s task more difficult.

Possibly the Government prefers to spare itself some embarrassment by declining to

put whatever it knows about “bribe-takers” into the record of the Tribunal.

Be that as it may be, the circumstances disclosed to the Tribunal do not rise to the level

of “clear and compelling evidence” of corruption.

However, the Tribunal’s conclusion that corruption of Government officials is
established to the lower standard of “balance of probabilities” is relevant to the issue

of the Claimants’ good faith, which is dealt with below.

6.3.5. Fifth Allegation — Bribery Scheme in June 2015 to Restore Control of
Savan Vegas to the Claimants

The Respondent seized control of the Savan Vegas and gambling facilities on 15 April
2015. Its right to do so was eventually confirmed by an arbitral tribunal constituted

under the SIAC by its Award dated 29 June 2017.°°

Prior to the SIAC Award, however, the Claimants asserted a right under the 2014

on the open market prior to the 15 April 2015 deadline imposed as a term of the

Settlement with the Government. The allegedly genuine third-party offer to purchase

to do so.*3 In testimony before the SIAC tribunal in January 2017, Angus Noble

165. While unrealistic, Mr. Noble genuinely believed he could orchestrate the purchase,

which he testified was, for him, “the chance of a lifetime.”
6.3.5.3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

166. The MaxGaming offer was indeed a sham, but bribery and corruption, as opposed to

fraud and chicanery, is not established.

6.3.6. Sixth Allegation — Miscellaneous Acts of Bribery and Corruption

167. Other allegations of bribery and corruption were made:

(a) offer of a US $7 million bribe to the Prime Minister of Laos for approval of a

licence to establish a casino in the capital city of Vientiane;§”

(b) a bribe of US $80,000 to the Governor of the Province of Champasak to approve
a slot club at Chong Mek;** and

(c) bribes totalling US $106,000 to Government officials to enable the opening and

continued operation of the Paksan Slot Club.*?

There is no “clear and convincing” evidence against the Claimants in support of any of

these additional claims of bribery and corruption.

168. As the Claimants point out, the Respondent has identified only two possible
Government bribe takers, namely Mr. Bounnong (but there is no indication he has been
investigated) and Madam Manivone. The evidence is that Madam Manivone was put
under investigation only after refusing to testify for the Respondent.°” The Claimants
state that on 29 May 2014, the Respondent promised its Rejoinder would reveal the

results of its investigation. It did not.

169. The Claimants complain, rightly, that the Respondent’s failure to offer any credible
explanation for not pursuing the investigation of its own employees, or indeed even to
attempt to identify the alleged bribe-takers, weighs against the credibility of these

miscellaneous allegations.”!

170. Nevertheless, in the Tribunal’s view, none of these additional allegations is supported

by sufficient evidence to warrant further inquiry or comment.

6.4. The Claimant’s Lack of Good Faith

171. Much of the Claimant’s case rests on the allegation that it proceeded in all respects in
good faith but was thwarted at every turn by a corrupt and devious Government acting
in bad faith. On the contrary, the evidence is clear that the Claimants dealt in bad faith
with the Government from the initial signing of the Paksong Hotel and Casino PDA
calling for a US $25 million hotel and casino to the financial irregularities in the
operation of the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino. The Claimants never intended to build

a US $25 million facility in Paksong. From the Claimants’ perspective, the benefit of

2000, CLA(LH)-070, which rejected the Government's bribery defence in part for failure to show the implicated
Government official was investigated and prosecuted:
116. Although the Tribunal believes Minister Sultan’s testimony that he was not personally aware
that “Mr. Kandil was an agent to Farargy” and that when he did learn about it, “I passed that to the
ing a full-fledged igation”, it is undi that Mr. Kandil was never
in Egypt in with this R bly, because Egypt has failed to
present the Tribunal with any information about the investigation requested by Minister Sultan, the
Tribunal does not know whether an investigation was conducted and, if so, whether the investigation
was closed because the prosecutor determined that Mr. Kandil was innocent, because of lack of
evidence, or because of complicity by other government officials. Nevertheless, given the fact that
the Egyptian government was made aware of this agreement by Minister Sultan but decided (for
whatever reasons) not to prosecute Mr. Kandil, the Tribunal is reluctant to immunize Egypt from
liability in this arbitration because it now alleges that the agreement with Mr. Kandil was illegal under
Egyptian law.

the Paksong PDA was a monopoly to block other more serious investors from offering
gambling facilities in Champaska and Salavan Provinces. Having obtained the
monopoly, the Claimants attempted to force the Government’s hand in relocating the
project to what, from the Government’s perspective, was a much less attractive site.
The bad faith continued through the disputes over the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino,
which was built but operated in defiance of Sanum’s reporting obligations to the
Government (and, when the books were eventually opened, revealed significant
financial irregularities). The bad faith continued further up to its recent efforts to deter
Madam Sengkeo’s appearance to testify at the merits proceeding and the sham

MaxGaming offer to purchase Savan Vegas in April of 2015.

The principle of good faith arises in investment treaty arbitrations in various contexts.
Tribunals, of course, regularly refer to Article 31(1) of the VCLT for the rule that
treaties shall be interpreted in good faith. The obligation extends to a duty of parties to
arbitrate in good faith.°? In Phoenix v. Czech Republic, the tribunal referred to
Phoenix’s “initiation and pursuit of this arbitration” as “an abuse of the system of
international ICSID investment arbitration.”°? (The tribunal found an abuse of rights
in that case by the “claimant’s creation of a legal fiction in order to gain access to an

international arbitration procedure to which it was not entitled.)

The Tribunal listened carefully to the testimony of Mr. John Baldwin and found him to
be an argumentative witness who preferred evasion to candour. Much of his testimony

was

 

imply not credible. He proceeded in bad faith from the outset in assuring the
Government that he intended to invest US $25 million at the Paksong site, which by his

own account was likely to be highly unprofitable.

Mr. Baldwin is the directing mind of both Claimant companies. His conduct throughout

was to advance their corporate interests. His bad faith conduct is their conduct. While

the Government’s conduct was at times aggressive and inappropriate in relation to the
Settlement (as documented, for example, in the Second Material Breach Application),
nevertheless the Claimant failed to establish that the Government acted in bad faith in

relation to the investors or the investments.

175. It is well established that the bad faith conduct of the investor is relevant to the grant of

relief under an investment treaty.°>

176. To summarize, the particular acts of bad faith by Mr. Baldwin on behalf of the Claimant

of most concern to the Tribunal are:

(a) misrepresentations made to the Government to obtain Paksong Hotel and Casino
PDA on the strength of a promise to make a US $25 million investment on the

site which, in the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants never intended to pursue;

(b

likely making illegal payments to Government officials to stop the E&Y audit of

the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino;

(c

likely attempting to obstruct justice with the payment of US $875,000 to Madam
Sengkeo directed, as to US $575,000, to the obstruction of the due process of
this arbitration by paying Madam Sengkeo not to testify;

(d

attempting to mislead the Treaty Tribunals with the sham offer to purchase the

Savan Vegas from MaxGaming Consulting.”

177. As will be seen, the Claimant’s claims for expropriation fail on the facts. However,

having listened to Mr. Baldwin’s explanations over several hearings of his dealings

°S See UNCTAD Series on International Agreements III, Fair and Equitable Treatment (2012) at pp. 83-85:
Investor conduct has emerged as a relevant factor in the analysis of FET claims by arbitral tribunals. It
may be relevant in two ways. First, it may justify the measure taken against the investor by the
respondent country. Thus in Genin v. Estonia, the tribunal found that the Estonian national bank had
good reasons to revoke the operating license of the claimant's investment because the claimant had
failed to disclose relevant facts. In such cases, the adverse measure serves as a State’s reaction to, ora
sanction for the investor’s conduct...Fraud or misrepresentation on the part of an investor may
form the basis of a legitimate regulatory interference with its rights. In such cases, even the
outright termination of the investment may be justified, provided it is a proportionate response
to the investor’s conduct in light of the relevant domestic laws of the host State...in some situations,
an investor’s own conduct may be held to be a cause for the harm suffered.

% Although the MaxGaming incident occurred afer the date of Settlement, it was fully debated at the Hearing and

formed part of the corpus of the bad faith allegations.

with Laos, the Tribunal wishes to leave in no doubt its conclusion that Mr. Baldwin
and Sanum exhibited manifest bad faith in various efforts not only to manipulate the
Government to advance their gambling initiatives but, in the instance of Madam

Sengkeo, to manipulate the arbitration process itself.

THE CLAIM FOR EXPROPRIATION
7.1. Thanaleng Slot Club
71.1. Background

At its origin, the dispute underlying the Thanaleng claim is a contractual dispute
between two private parties, Sanum and ST. They had signed a Master Agreement on
30 May 2007, where they agreed “to negotiate and work towards entering into certain
joint ventures, represented by necessary agreements, which shall convey 60% of all 24
Party’s [ST] gaming businesses located in the country of Lao PDR ... This Agreement
is not intended to be a definitive agreement but only provides the Parties’ general
understandings of their relationship. The Parties agree to work together in good faith
to negotiate and finalize all necessary agreement to fully implement the concept and
terms set forth in this Agreement.”°’ The Respondent’s treatment of the Thanaleng
situation is part of the “totality of the facts” said by counsel for the Claimants to be

relevant to Sanum’s Treaty claims.°®

On 4 October 2008, Sanum and ST signed a Participation Agreement for Thanaleng
(“Participation Agreement”). Under this agreement, Sanum agreed to supply to ST

certain slot machines, on a “generated revenue sharing/participation basis.”°? This

 

agreement was meant to expire on 11 October 2011 when an existing contract of ST
with another supplier of slot machines expired. As explained by Sanum, “the expiration
of the Participation [Agreement] is only the end of percentage of profit distribution and
proportion of shareholding of each party in the business participation of the Slot Club,

which shifted from ST Group who used to receive 60% to receive 40% instead, and

°7 Master Agreement, Exhibit C(B)-1.

Sanum who used to receive 40% to receive 60%, and at the same time (after 11 October
2011) there shall change or create a joint venture company of which Sanum holds 60%

and ST Group 40%.”!°

The controversy arose because Sanum and ST disagreed on whether the Master
Agreement remained in force and was valid and created binding obligations on the
parties, despite the expiration of the Participation Agreement. Was the Participation
Agreement a temporary agreement just to cover the period of time when other slot
machine supplier contracts were in place? Once those machine supplier contract expired
on 11 October 2011, did the Master Agreement and other agreements referenced above
remain in effect and control the contractual relationship between Sanum and the ST

Group?!°!

7.1.2. The Claimants’ Argument

The Claimants argue that they were deprived of their investment by flawed court
proceedings tainted by interference by the Respondent and without payment of
compensation. The Claimants summarize the measures for which they seek relief as
follows: “Beginning with premature termination of the OEDR proceedings on orders
from the Minister of Justice, and police participation in Sanum’s eviction from the
Thanaleng Club, and ending with manifestly unreasonable judgments rendered by the
courts of Laos, Respondent directed a result in favor of ST that deprived Sanum of its
entitlement to 60% of the revenues generated by its investment in the Thanaleng Slot
Club. The entire process was marred by manifest procedural defects, as well as
producing a result that was substantially unreasonable.”

At the closing of the Hearing, the Claimants confirmed that their Thanaleng claim in

this proceeding is not based on denial of justice but on the allegation that the totality of

-63-

the Respondent’s treatment substantially deprived the Claimants of the enjoyment of

their investment without the payment of compensation.!

The Claimants insist that Sanum did have an ownership interest in Thanaleng as
established in the Master Agreement, and invested millions of dollars in Thanaleng.
The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s interpretation of the Master Agreement is
contrary to the understanding and conduct of the parties to this agreement; it was a
binding agreement that contemplated future negotiations between Sanum and a would-
be supplier of slot machines and not between Sanum and ST. The fact that the Master
Agreement contemplated additional agreements does not detract from its binding
character. The Claimants point out that when ST sought the judicial annulment of the
Master Agreement, the document was described as the “basic agreement defining rights

in order to manage the relations between both parties.”!

The Claimants dispute the relevance of the cases relied on by the Respondent because
in the instant case the Respondent consistently treated the Master Agreement as legally
binding, “[o]nly Laos — for the first time in these proceedings — has ever characterized
the Master Agreement as an agreement to agree that did not generate legally enforceable
rights.”!0>

According to the Claimants, ST refused repeatedly to accept payment in exchange for
a contractually-required exchange of rights which did not extinguish the rights of
Sanum, “but merely constituted another breach by ST of its obligations to relinquish

control of the club to Sanum.”!%°

7.1.3. The Respondent’s Argument

The Respondent submits that the decision of the Lao Courts concerns a private dispute
between ST and Sanum and there was nothing untoward in the various judicial
proceedings in Laos. According to the Respondent, the Claimant has committed abuse

of process by pursuing contradictory claims in parallel arbitrations against Laos based

on the same treaties and the same economic interests. In this respect the Respondent,

at the Hearing, recounted the timeline of the procedure:

We have in July 2012 the decision of the Lao Commercial Court.
Immediately, before they exhausted their local remedies, which they are
required to do under international law, they filed this arbitration alleging that
the Thanaleng court decision was a denial of justice and an expropriation.
Later they amended to say it’s an expropriation.

In June 2015, there was a decision by the LHNV tribunal on the first material,
the breach application. They didn’t prevail.

Three months later, they filed the SIAC arbitration against ST on the same
contracts, alleging that the Lao court proceedings had no meaning, they were
just -- how would one say it?

One would say their view of the Lao court proceedings in Singapore was that
they were a voluntary mediation. If you don’t like the result of a mediation,
you withdraw and you go to court. That’s how they’re treating the Lao court
proceeding when they go to Singapore: it didn’t matter, is it wasn’t definitive.
So, they get an ST SIAC Award in August 2016. They filed it in the Lao
courts in 2017.

Then the Lao courts refused to enforce it in August 2017. On 1 September
2017, they filed a denial of justice claim in the new ICSID arbitration. Then
in December 2017, the second material breach application was granted,
reinstating this tribunal to hear the Thanaleng case again.

So they have these conflicting — once you issued the second material breach
decision, it revived these two treaty claims that are in conflict with the treaty
claims they had filed in September 2017.'”

187. The Respondent further explained:

Sanum said in these cases that the 26 July 2012 decision of the court was
expropriation number one. They said their rights were expropriated, that’s
the claim here, and they filed the first BIT claims in August 2012.

But the second BIT arbitration says that the date of expropriation was August
2017 when the Lao courts refused to enforce the SIAC award, and that’s the
subject of the second BIT arbitration.

So you have these inconsistent claims made by the same claimant under the

same treaties, based on the same facts. We say that’s an abuse of process.‘

7.1.4. The Tribunal’s Analysis

188. The Thanaleng claim relates to a dispute between the Claimants and ST. It concerns

the Respondent only to the extent of the Respondent’s alleged interference in court

‘07 Amended Transcript, 3 September 2018, p. 143, 6-25 to p. 144, 1-17.

proceedings, and only if its actions could be characterized as a violation of international

law.

The Claimants have placed the weight of their argument on the alleged interference of
the Respondent in the Lao Commercial Court proceedings in 2012. But the dispute
resolution provision in the Master Agreement (Article 2.10)'” provides for a four-stage
mechanism. At the fourth stage, after a party to the Master Agreement has exhausted
the remedies available in the Lao Courts, it may submit the dispute to arbitration if it is
unsatisfied with the result without the need to demonstrate a breach of due process or

other violations in the conduct of the court proceedings.

The Claimants also explained that the four-step mechanism provided for in the Master
Agreement has been found to violate Lao law and, therefore, “any award rendered under
the mechanism that differed from the judgment of the Lao Courts would [not] be
enforceable in Laos (the only country where the ST’s assets are now located) as a matter

of Lao public policy.’””!!°

Sanum has exercised in full the four levels of remedies provided for in the Master
Agreement. After exhausting its recourse to the Lao Courts, Sanum initiated the SIAC
arbitration in 2015. In 2016, the SIAC tribunal awarded Sanum the $200 million it had

claimed.

The Claimants say that they have not been able to enforce the SIAC award and link the
inability to enforce it to the alleged interference of the Respondent in the Lao
Commercial Court in 2012. As explained by the Claimants at the Hearing:

The problem is, looking at the totality of the circumstances, the Lao Court of
Appeals — and that’s the highest level in an enforcement proceeding — won’t

109 “If any dispute shall arise, the Parties agree to conduct an amicable negotiation. If such dispute cannot be
settled by mediation, the Parties may submit such disputes to the Resolution of Economic Dispute Organization
or Courts of the Lao PDR according to the provision and law of Lao PDR in accordance with this Agreement. All
proceedings of the arbitration shall be conducted in Lao and English languages.

Before settlement by the arbitrator under the Rules of the Resolution of Economic Dispute Organization, the
Parties shall use all efforts to assist the dispute resolution in accordance with the laws of Lao PDR.

If one of the Parties is unsatisfied with the results of the above procedure, the Parties shall mediate and, if
necessary, arbitrate such dispute using internationally recognized mediation/arbitration company in Macao, SAR
PRC.” Master Agreement, C(B)-001.

allow enforcement of the SIAC award and so the original action that the
government took in ramming the original decision through to benefit ST and
forcing claimants to have to go to that additional stage, to have to go to the
fourth stage, that allowed ST the time to move all of its assets back into Laos
and put the claimants in a position where they would be dependent on going
to Laos to enforce the award against ST where the same thing, or worse, could
happen. So, there was a distinct consequence at the stage of the measure
relating to the Thanaleng proceeding in 2012.

Even if the claimant could then go on to the SIAC proceeding, which it did,
there was still a consequence and there was still harm caused by that action,
because being able to go to the fourth tier, that didn’t right the ship. That
didn’t enable Sanum to have a clear path to recovery. So there’s still
consequences to what the government did in 2012.”""!

The Claimants want to skip over the fact that Sanum has a valid arbitral award against a
private party in which it was awarded 200 million dollars after it exhausted the remedies
in the Lao Courts for the alleged interference of the Respondent in the Lao Commercial
Court back in 2012. The alleged inability to enforce the award is not before this Tribunal
and it has not been proven by the Claimants that “there was a distinct consequence [of
the Government’s alleged interference] at the stage of the measure relating to the
Thanaleng proceeding in 2012.”!!? There is simply no persuasive evidence that the
alleged interference of the Respondent in the proceeding of a lower court interfered with

the steps taken by the Claimants to exercise their rights under the Master Agreement and,

in particular, their recourse to SIAC arbitration.

The Claimants say their claim in the SIAC arbitration was not for the full amount of the
value lost in Thanaleng. The Claimants explained why Sanum capped its claim for

damages:

in part because ST did not appear and that raised the issue of whether or not
they were going to hide assets, such that it was fruitless to seek the full value
of Thanaleng. The full value of Thanaleng, I know we’re bifurcated so we’re
not going to talk very much about those kind of things, but the full value of
Thanaleng is more than 400 million in order to not have the fees, and in light
of the practical recognition that ST was likely hiding its assets, we capped the
SIAC claim at 200 million. So it won’t be possible to recover the full amount
from ST to cover the cost of the damage that the government caused by
directing the Thanaleng case in Laos.''*

195. The Respondent is not responsible for the decision of the Claimants to self-limit the
amount of the claim against ST. The evidence does not establish any improper

interference by the Respondent in the court proceedings.

196. In sum, the Tribunal concludes that the claim for expropriation in respect of the

Thanaleng investment lacks any merit.

7.2. Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino
7.2.1. Background

197. On 10 August 2007, a Project Development Agreement was concluded between Lao
PDR, and Sanum, the Laotian company Nouansavanh Construction Co. Ltd., and Mr.
Sittixay Xaysana for the development of the Paksong casino (“Paksong PDA”). Under
the Paksong PDA, a Laotian entity, Paksong Vegas and Casino Co. Ltd., was set up
with Lao PDR holding 20%, Sanum 60% and the ST entities 20%. The Paksong PDA
required the Company to build and operate a $25 million hotel casino and golf resort in

the Paksong district of Champasak Province.

7.2.2. Location of Paksong
198. As explained by the Claimants, the location was challenging:

“The challenges were both logistical and commercial. Logistically, Paksong’s
location meant that transportation of construction materials would be more
costly than at the Savan Vegas site, as access to the site was more difficult
and time consuming, and that other construction costs would be significantly
higher than those of Savan Vegas. Also, the concession was located on the
side of a large hill which precluded the building of simple, large buildings to
house the hotel and casino and other amenities. Commercially, since Paksong
was not located on the border with Thailand or even in a population center in
Laos that was easy to access, it lacked a readily identifiable customer base.
The challenges of attracting customers made it difficult to identify the optimal
type of facility to construct on the site.”!'*

(Respondent’s Opening Submission, Slide 96)

Mr. Baldwin testified about the problem posed by Paksong’s distance from the Thai
border:

Another challenge posed by Paksong Vegas had to do with its customer base.

Because Lao citizens generally are restricted from playing table games, the

customer base for our casinos consists largely of Thai citizens who live in

Northeastern Thailand. However, because Paksong Vegas would be located

deep in Laos’s interior, without easy access to the border, we were concerned

that it would be difficult to attract customers to the casino.
These challenges notwithstanding, Mr. John Baldwin testified that the Paksong project
package “came with very valuable benefits. Chief among these were the monopoly
gaming rights in Champasak and Salavan Provinces granted to Paksong Vegas under
the PDA.”!!¢

Due to the challenges posed by the site, on 31 March 2008, Paksong Vegas proposed
to the provincial government, inter alia, to move the entire project to the area near
Chong Mek. On 29 April 2008, the proposal was rejected by the provincial

government.

On 21 August 2008, the office of the Prime Minister advised that Paksong Vegas was
to return Paksong and pursue only the project at Khone Phapheng (where the

Government also favoured development) together with other interested parties. The

notice from the Champasak Provincial Office requested Sanum “to follow the
agreements already reached by higher authority and only do the work at Kilometer 30
in Paksong. (According to instructions from the Government Secretariat, if the
company cannot comply, then the project must be placed on hold for now).”!!7 The
notice added that “[i]t is not approved to open casino branches in Paksong and other
places, only at Khone Phapheng. The Paksong land (Kilometer 30) will be returned to

the Government.”!!*

On 23 October 2008, the Prime Minister’s Office issued a notice, purporting to strip
Paksong Vegas of its monopoly rights. The Prime Minister’s Office also reiterated that
Yingsoksay, the operator of the existing hotel and resort in the area, could look for other
foreign investors to develop Khone Phapheng; Paksong Vegas could participate in that
development if it chose to do so, but either way, according to the Prime Minister’s
Office, it no longer had the exclusive right to do so. Further, on 19 December 2008,
Champasak provincial authorities instructed Paksong Vegas to return the land
concession it had been granted so it could be used for “another purpose,” referencing

the Prime Minister’s 21 August 2008 notice.!!?

On 30 January 2009, a meeting was held in the MPI’s offices. It was attended by all
Lao agencies concerned and Paksong Vegas. The Paksong Vegas and Casino
Development Project and the Khone Phapheng Entertainment Complex Project

Development were discussed. The Tribunal will re-visit this meeting in its analysis.

On 27 April 2010, the MPI terminated the PDA because Paksong Vegas had not signed
a land concession agreement in accordance with Article 4 of the PDA, and construction
on the project had been delayed for more than two years, which affected the “social-
economic development plan of Champasak province.”!”° Termination of the PDA was

re-affirmed by the Respondent on 10 April 2012.

7.2.3. The Claimant’s Argument

The dispute concerns the termination of the Paksong PDA and the revocation of the
concomitant land concession. For the Claimant, the actions of the Respondent
constitute an expropriation under Article 4 of the BIT. The Claimant argues that the
Respondent ignores the evidence that Lao authorities had ordered Sanum to cease
construction and two years later without prior notice cancelled the PDA on grounds of

failing to develop the land.

The Claimant questions the Respondent’s defence to the expropriation claim. First,
there is no contemporaneous evidence that Sanum repudiated the PDA when it
proposed to relocate. Second, the Respondent ignores the work done by Sanum.!?!
Third, the contention that Sanum lacked necessary funds has never been raised before,
and the Respondent has not followed the PDA’s procedures to establish “financial
inability”. Fourth, cancellation to avoid the Claimant’s monopoly rights does not

absolve the Respondent from the claim of expropriation.

7.2.4. The Respondent’s Argument

The Respondent claims that Sanum was not a ready, willing and able investor for the
Paksong project. According to the Respondent, Sanum forfeited the concession
because the location was not commercially acceptable. The Respondent explains that
Paksong and Savannakhet were linked; they were part of a bargain: whoever would
develop Savannakhet, an excellent commercial site, must also develop the less
attractive Paksong. According to the Respondent, Paksong is in the Champasak
province and, in addition to Paksong, two other locations in that province are mentioned
in the record: Chong Mek and Khonephapheng. The Respondent contends that Sanum
was only interested in Chong Mek, but not in either of the other sites. The provincial
government was keen to develop the remote areas while Sanum was interested in more
profitable sites; the interests of Sanum as a commercial developer and of the provincial

government were not aligned.

"21 See slide 20 of Claimant’s Opening Argument.

209.

210.

211.

-71-

The Respondent argues that it is impossible to read into the Paksong PDA the right
claimed by Sanum to build other casinos or slot clubs. The PDA gives Sanum the
exclusive right to operate in the provinces covered by the PDA, which simply means
“no one else would be allowed to build a casino or slot club in those provinces.”!?? The
Respondent affirms that there has never been an additional casino or slot club. There
has not been expropriation of “monopoly rights”.'2> According to the Respondent, Mr.
Baldwin’s assertion that Sanum could not build at Paksong because the Government
“would no longer respect its monopoly rights” is frivolous. Mr. Baldwin refused to
develop Paksong because he did not want to lose money on a project doomed to

commercial failure.”!?4

7.2.5. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The issues to be addressed by the Tribunal may be formulated as follows: Was the act
of termination of the PDA an expropriatory measure or the exercise by the Respondent
of its right to terminate the PDA for failure of Paksong Vegas to meet its obligations?
In addition, what weight should be given to the allegation that the procedure for

termination provided for in Article 19 of the PDA was not followed?

First of all, what were the rights of Sanum in Paksong Vegas? In its Reply, the Claimant
notes that “Laos does not dispute that Claimant possessed property rights through
Paksong Vegas that could be subject to expropriation, most notably, the valuable
monopoly rights in Champasak Province acquired pursuant to the Paksong Vegas
PDA.”!?5 The Respondent did not question this understanding of the Claimant in the
Rejoinder or the Opening Statement at the Hearing. However, at the closing, the
Respondent argued that the Claimant had no cognizable property right based on the
definition of the term “Land Map” in the PDA.'?° This definition explains that the seal

of the Government Agency affixed to the land lease demonstrates “conclusively that

the right to lease that piece of land belongs to the company.”!?’ But the company as

defined in the PDA means the parties to the Paksong PDA, one of which is the Claimant.

Second, what is the extent of Paksong Vegas’s monopoly rights in Champasak
province? As confirmed by Mr. Baldwin’s testimony at the Hearing, Mr. Baldwin
wanted to develop a site at Chong Mek. He agreed that the monopoly rights were limited
to the Paksong development area and did not include Chong Mek, “unless the
government agreed to modify this. The way it’s written right now, it does not include
Chong Mek but it doesn’t say we can’t ask for modifications.”!?* Mr. Baldwin also
confirmed that he really knew that the Government policy was not to approve a move

to Chong Mek.

Third, did Paksong Vegas forfeit its rights when the Claimant informed the Lao
Government that it did not wish to pursue the project at Paksong? The Claimant has
explained that the proposal of 31 March 2008 remained subject to Government
approval. On 29 April 2018, the Government rejected the proposal and instructed
Sanum to “follow the agreements already reached by higher authority and only do the
work at Kilometer 30 in Paksong. (According to instructions from the Government
Secretariat, if the company cannot comply then the project must be placed on hold for

now).”!29

The terms of the notice rejecting the proposal affirm that at the time, the Government’s
intention was not to terminate the PDA, but to request that the existing agreements be
respected, and only if the company could not comply, to stop the project for the time
being. The Respondent has argued the Claimant’s forfeiture of the rights of Paksong
Vegas in this proceeding in 2014, six years later. If this would have been the case, it

would not have been necessary for the Government to terminate the PDA in 2010.

Was the Respondent entitled to terminate the PDA in 2010? Sanum has argued that it

had been asked to stop work at Paksong and that was the only reason why the work was

behind. However, the minutes of the meeting held on 30 January 2009 show that the
meeting chair “cited many deficiencies of the company [Paksong Vegas] in its
performance of the contract.”!°° More significantly, among the unanimous resolutions
reached at this meeting, Paksong Vegas accepted that “in the past it has not carried out
the Paksong Vegas project as scheduled in the contract and as it was presented to the
Province.”!3! According to the minutes: “The meeting agreed to have Paksong Vegas
and Casino Co., Ltd. to follow instructions in Lao Government Notice No. 1469/GS,
dated 21 August 2008 and Notice No. 1887/GS, dated 23 October 2008. The main
points of discussion were: not to approve opening branches of the Casino in Paksong
and other areas, but to allow casino operations only in Khone Phapheng Development
Project. The land in Paksong Development Project (KM30) is to be returned to the
Government. No exclusive rights are to be granted, and the agreement with Paksong

9132

Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd is to be revised.

The Tribunal observes that the Claimant admitted, at the meeting of 30 January 2009,
that “it has not carried out the Paksong Vegas project as scheduled in the contract and
as it was presented to the Province.” Mr. Baldwin also testified at the Hearing that no
contract to build a $25 million five-star hotel with a casino and nightclub was ever
signed. !33

What is the significance of the lack of notice by the Respondent to Paksong Vegas
under Article 19 of the PDA? According to Article 19, notice was required indicating
the non-performance and giving 90 days to correct it. It is undisputed that the
Respondent did not give notice to Paksong Vegas of non-performance of the obligations
under the PDA. But Paksong Vegas had not made the investment it had promised in
the PDA within the expected timeframe as admitted by Paksong Vegas. It had also
agreed at the meeting of January 30, 2009 to operate a casino in Khone Phapheng, and
“{a]s for the Paksong project, the company is happy to follow the government’s

guidance.”'*4 As recorded in the same meeting, the Government’s guidance was to

return the land to the Government.!35_ In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds there
was no need for Paksong Vegas to be further notified. The Respondent had been clear
in that the PDA would need to be revised and Sanum had agreed to revise it. The
Claimant had not complied with the terms of the PDA and could not reasonably keep
its monopoly rights indefinitely while at the same time maintaining that the
development of Paksong was a losing proposition not worth a US $25 million
investment. Mr. Baldwin confirmed at the Hearing that no contract to build a $25

million five-star hotel with a casino and nightclub was ever signed.'*°

The Tribunal finds that the Claimant lost its rights under the PDA because it breached
its terms and, by its own admission, the Paksong site could not be developed. This
Claimant’s admission contradicts its argument that work was being done and, if not
done, was due to the Government order to stop the work. The loss of Paksong was not
an expropriation, it was termination for breach of contract. The monopoly rights
cherished by Sanum had a concomitant obligation to invest, which Sanum admits it did

not fulfil.

7.3. Paksan Slot Club
7.3.1. Background

As told by Sanum and not disputed by the Respondent, the relevant facts are that “[s]oon
after Sanum agreed to partner with ST, it discovered that there was an existing slot club
in operation in the Paksan district of Bolikhamxay Province — one of the provinces in
which Savan Vegas has the exclusive right to operate. To enforce that exclusive right,
ST asked the Government of Bolikhamxay Province to shut down the club, and it did
so.”!37 The existence of the slot club led Savan Vegas to open its own club at the same

location, the Paksan Hotel.

The Ministry of Information and Culture (“MIC”) granted Savan Vegas a one-year
license to operate a slot club in the Bolikhamxay Province on 24 October 2007. The
MIC renewed the license on 26 November 2008.

After the lease of the former club expired in October 2008, Savan Vegas signed its own
lease on 25 December 2008 and refurbished the space in the Paksan Hotel formerly
occupied by the slot club. The club re-opened on 25 October 2009 and the MIC

renewed the slot license for another year on 27 October 2009.

On 18 February 2010, the Prime Minister’s Office ordered the slot club license to be
cancelled: “The authorization to open an electronic gaming club granted to Savan
Vegas Ltd. by the Information and Culture Department of Bolikhamxay Province is not
in accordance with regulations in that it exceeds the authority of that office. Therefore,
you should stop operation of electronic gaming at Paksan Hotel. Further, the company

is no longer authorized to erect an advertising billboard in Bolikhamxay Province.”!°*

The license was not renewed in 2010. On 11 March 2011, the Government ordered the
MIC and the provincial Governor to close the club within three days. The club closed
on 13 March 2011. Sanum and Savan Vegas petitioned the Prime Minister to re-open
the club. The petition was denied on 19 May 2011 and Savan Vegas was ordered to

comply with Notice No. 305.

7.3.2. The Claimant’s Argument

The Claimant contends that the Respondent’s closure of the Paksan slot club constitutes
an unlawful taking. In the Statement of Claim, the Claimant attributes the closure to
the dissatisfaction of ST with the Claimant on whether revenues of the Paksan slot club
and the concomitant tax obligations should be consolidated with those of Savan Vegas.
As told by the Claimant, “[i]n a meeting they [ST] had with Sanum in the fall of 2010,
ST demanded they be paid 30% of Paksan’s gaming revenues, regardless of what any
agreement said. If Sanum did not agree, ST would have the club shut down ... ST then

proceeded to make good on their threat. Sanum soon learned that ST had convinced

-76-

officials at the MIC to issue a notice instructing Savan Vegas to close the Paksan

club.”159

The Claimant also disputes the Respondent’s contention that most patrons were Lao
people because there is no bridge at Paksan. The Claimant points out that there is a
ferry to cross to and from Thailand. Secondly, this argument was not used to close the
club as it is evident in the minutes of the Government meeting held on 11 March 2011
where the closure was decided.'4° The minutes only refer to Notices No. 305 and
470/MCD that Savan Vegas claims not to have seen earlier. Indeed, in the case of

Notice No. 305, Savan Vegas affirms that it became aware of it in this arbitration.

The Claimant points out that, “prior to filing its Statement of Defense in this arbitration,
Laos had never asserted that the closure of Paksan was justified by non-compliance
with the Savan Vegas PDA, failure to obtain a separate Foreign Investment License, or
the MIC’s supposed lack of authority to issue slot club licenses. In fact, Savan Vegas
was never made aware of the existence of Notice No. 1957 until this arbitration.”!*!

Furthermore, the Claimant recalls that the Respondent withdrew the accusing witness

statement on Lao people being allowed to gamble at the Paksan Hotel.

The Claimant further argues that, “although Paksan’s license had expired at the time of
the club’s closure, by permitting the club to continue operating without a license and
by assuring Savan Vegas that its license was in the process of being renewed, the

Government de facto extended Sanum’s rights in the Paksan investment.”!4?

7.3.3. The Respondent’s Argument
In the Reply, the Claimant questions the merit of

Laos’s attempt to rely on a number of Government instruments that it claims
deprived the MIC of authority to issue slot club licenses. Notice No.1957,
issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on 4 November 2008, did not, as Laos
now claims, require that all slot club licenses be issued by the Prime
Minister’s Office rather than by the MIC. Critically, Notice No. 1957 is titled
‘Solution for the slot machine business issues in Khammouan Province and

Vientiane City’, and it is addressed only to the governors of those areas, as
well as the MIC, the MPI, and the Minister of Public Security. Thus, on its
face, it has no application to Bolikhamxay Province, where the Paksan slot
club was located. Moreover, Notice No. 1957 provides that ‘the Government’,
and not just the Prime Minister’s Office, has the right to issue slot club
licenses. The MIC is undoubtedly part of the Lao Government. As to Notice
No. 545, issued by the Prime Minister in March 2008, and now claimed by
Laos to ‘have barred new casinos and slot clubs’, this was issued after Paksan
received its first operating license in 2007.'%

In the Rejoinder, the Respondent affirms that a “de facto” license cannot be
expropriated “when the real one year license had expired.”'44 The Respondent admits
that it is the first time that it argues that Savan Vegas was not authorized to operate a
slot club in Paksan. The Respondent states: “‘it is the first time, but the position is

correct in law. A party operating outside the terms of its license and concession

2145

7.3.4. The Tribunal’s Analysis

A first issue to be addressed by the Tribunal is the disputed meaning of monopoly in

the PDA. Article 9 reads as follows:

The Company has been granted monopoly rights for its casino business
operation only with the condition that the Government shall not approve and
grant any other parties or entities who put up their applications for the
operation of certain casino business in the two neighboring provinces close to
the project development zone of the Company, namely Salavan and
Champasak throughout the concession period of 50 years.

However, should there have any applications submitted by any parties or
entities, all those shall be made through the consent and approval of both the
government and the authorized investors who have management rights.”"4°

The Claimant’s argument that Savan Vegas’ foreign investment license permitted
Savan Vegas to operate gambling facilities in all three provinces where it had monopoly
finds no support in the terms of the PDA. The Claimant and ST in fact recognized the

need to have a specific slot license at Paksan and applied for its renewal year after year.

On the other hand, the argument of the Respondent that the Paksan operation was illegal
under the Law on Investment Promotion may be correct in law, as affirmed by the
Respondent in the Rejoinder,'*” but of doubtful persuasiveness when the MIC had

issued the Paksan slot club a license three times during the period 2007-2009.

The Respondent has argued that the license was terminated in February 2010 and that
the Claimant had operated the Paksan slot club without a license for about a year. On
the other hand, the Claimant has affirmed that it was not aware of Notice No. 305 of
18 February 2010.'** Irrespective of whether the license was terminated by order of the
Prime Minister’s Office, it is undisputed that the Paksan slot club continued to operate
beyond the term of its license. For the Tribunal, the key fact is that the license granted
in 2009 had expired in October 2010 and had not been renewed. Monopoly rights kept
competitors out but did not entitle Savan Vegas to establish and operate other gambling
facilities unless those other facilities were specifically authorized. The Claimant has
not shown that Savan Vegas had a right to the license’s renewal or even that it attempted

to renew the license.

At the time of the Paksan slot club’s closure, the club was operating without a license
and there is no documentary evidence that the Respondent had created any legitimate
expectation in the Claimant that the license would be renewed or that it may operate de
facto as if it had a license. The Claimant’s argument about a de facto license begs the
question of why Sanum had applied for the license’s renewal in the preceding years.
The Tribunal concludes that the license expired on its own terms and had terminated

when the slot club was ordered to be closed.

7.4. Thakhet Casino and Hotel Resort
7.4.1. Background

In 2010, Sanum started negotiations with the Committee for the Laos-Thailand
Friendship Bridge III Economic Zone Development (the “SEZ” and the “SEZ

Committee”) for a land concession at the foot of a planned bridge to cross the Mekong

River. The negotiations resulted in a MOU between Sanum and the SEZ Committee
dated 20 October 2010. The MOU contemplated a land concession to Sanum of about
90 hectares in the SEZ, payment by Sanum of $900,000 to allow the provincial
government to compensate individuals occupying the land, and $400,000 to be paid
upon signature of the MOU. The MOU required Sanum to sign a land concession
within 30 days and secure all necessary approvals from the central and local

governments within one year prior to building on the concession land.

On 4 February 2011, Savan Vegas submitted a proposal for a slot club to the Governor
of the Khammouane Province and the MIC. The proposal was supported by the
Governor and, on 21 February 2011, the MIC approved the Savan Vegas’s Welcome

Center and Slot Club. Shortly thereafter, on 2 March 2011, the Prime Minister’s Office

 

directed the MIC to revoke its approval because slot club licenses may only be issued
“by the Government”, which was interpreted by the Prime Minister to mean the Prime
Minister’s Office.'49 On 29 March 2011, Sanum and Savan Vegas petitioned the Prime
Minister’s Office to grant permission to open the Welcome Center and Slot Club in the

SEZ. The petition was rejected in October 2011.

7.4.2. The Claimant’s Argument

According to the Claimant, the SEZ Committee had been negotiating with Sanum a
PDA and a land concession for the project, and by the end of 2011 the negotiations
were near completion. But then, “the Government sent Sanum a substantially revised
PDA, which removed approximately 16 hectares from the land that the SEZ Committee
had previously committed to grant Sanum in the MOU.” The Claimant affirms that the
removal of these 16 hectares compromised the feasibility of the project because they

fronted Highway 13 and the access road to the bridge.

(Source, Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slide 23, C(B)-0092) Disputed 16 hectares
colored in yellow)

According to the Claimant, the map above, which was appended to the 2010 MOU,
showed Sanum’s Highway 13 Frontage. However, the Respondent notes that Sanum
never made an application for a license or PDA to the MPI for the Thakhet
development, as required by the Law on Investment Protection. Instead, on 4 February
2011, Savan Vegas applied to the MIC for a license for a small slot club. At the time,
because of the order to close Paksan, Savan Vegas should have been aware that the
MIC had no authority to approve gambling licenses. In the application, Savan Vegas
referred to the MOU and attached the PDA, under which Savan Vegas affirmed that it
had the right to operate in three provinces. On 21 February 2011, the MIC authorized
gambling in Thakhet. On 2 March 2011, the Prime Minister revoked the authorization
and re-affirmed this decision on 7 October 2011 in view of the further request of Savan

Vegas on 29 March 2011. At the request of Sanum, the president of Sanum met with

239.

240.

-81-

relevant ministries on 25 November 2011, and again it was reiterated to Sanum that the

authorization to operate slot machines in Khammouane Province was illegal.

The Claimant in the Reply points out that the SEZ Committee was appointed by the
central Government, that the Government specifically instructed Sanum to negotiate
the PDA and land concession agreement with the SEZ Committee, and that the 30 days
to sign the land concession run as from approval by the SEZ Committee of a feasibility
study, master plan, social-economic and environmental impact study. The Claimant
contends that it submitted these documents, but negotiations of the PDA fell apart
because of the removal of the 16 key hectares. The Claimant points out the changing
reasons adduced by the Government to justify the removal of those hectares. First, the
Respondent had said that there was a holdout landowner who wanted more money;

later, it argued that the 16 hectares were never included in the concession.

The Claimant affirms that at the time it was not aware of Notice No. 305, and that, in
any case, this Notice does not deprive the MIC of its authority to issue slot licenses.
According to the Claimant, Savan Vegas reasonably believed that the MIC was the
relevant authority to which it should direct its application. This understanding was
supported by Respondent’s contemporaneous actions. For example, the Khammouane
Governor wrote to the MIC a letter of support on the province’s behalf. The MIC

approved the application on 21 February 2011.'5°

7.4.3. The Respondent’s Argument

The Respondent contends that the Claimant has not been able to rebut the Respondent’s
position that Sanum never obtained a license, a concession or a PDA from the
Respondent. The Respondent points out that in the Reply, the Claimant admits that the
parties had not reached agreement on whether the 16 hectares were included in the land
concession or the terms of the PDA: “it is patently clear as a matter of law that when

parties do not agree on material terms during the negotiations, they do not have an

'S0 Reply, para. 189,

241.

242.

243.

244,

-82-

agreement. The parties never concluded those negotiations and never signed the

agreements.”!>!

At the closing of the Hearing, the Respondent explained that the 16-hectare issue was
irrelevant because the key land was next to the bridge on the side of the river rather than
on the road frontage land as there would be a need to isolate the gambling area,

including space for customs control.

As regards the slot license, the Respondent has alleged that it was obtained through
bribes paid by Mr. Bouker to Mr. Boumong at the MIC.

7.4.4. The Tribunal’s Analysis

It was decided in the Tribunal’s ruling on the Merits of the Claimant’s Second Material
Breach Application that, in the Tribunal’s view,

the Claimant has not established a land entitlement that includes the disputed

16 hectares, and there is no undertaking by the Government in Section 22 to

use its powers of eminent domain to expropriate the existing private owners

for the financial benefit of the Claimant. Refusal to expropriate private land

for the private gain of the Claimant does not constitute evidence of ‘bad

faith.’!*
This decision was reached by the Tribunal in the context of whether the Government
breached Article 22 of the Deed of Settlement by failing to negotiate the Thakhet related
agreements in good faith. The Tribunal considers that the Claimants have also failed
to establish rights to the remainder of the land referred to in the MOU. Sanum had 365
days from the date of the Land Concession Agreement to seek all the approvals for all
investment activities described in the MOU. In turn, before the Land Concession
Agreement could be signed, Sanum needed to complete a Feasibility Study, a Master
Plan and a Socio-Economic and Environmental Impact Study for the Land Concession,
all to be approved by the Concessioner. The Land Concession Agreement required by
the MOU was never signed; it never went beyond the negotiation stage. Despite face

to face negotiations over the PDA throughout the summer and fall of 2011, Sanum and

247.

-83-

the SEZ Committee had not finalized the terms of the PDA, including the land
concession.'* In the overall picture, whether or not Sanum had obtained a licence had

no impact on the viability of its Thakhaek project.

In the view of the Tribunal it is clear from the MOU that Savan Vegas could not expand
to Thakhaek in the Kammouane Province without the “final approval from all
governmental authorities (central and local).”!*4 The MOU provides for the
eventuality that the approval is forthcoming and also in case it is not.!*> Furthermore,
the MOU subjects the exact location of the Concession Land to a future agreement:
“Once the exact location of the Concession Land has been agreed upon, the
Concessionee will confirm its acceptance of the Concession Land in writing to the

Concessioner.”!*° There was never any agreement in this respect.

The MOU shows that Savan Vegas’ monopoly rights did not encompass a right to

establish slot clubs or casinos beyond the area covered by the Savan Vegas PDA:

If the Concessionee would like to expand the casino or slot business of Savan
Vegas, which is an investment project of Sanum Investments Limited
according to the Foreign Investment License no. 09507 [not readable], dated
17 August 2007 to the Concession Land to be a branch (Welcome Center) of
Savan Vegas such expansion shall be proposed, approved and agreed in
writing from the Government first before implementing such expansion. The
Khammouane Province wilfully [sic] support the expansion of Savan Vegas
to the Land Concession according to the appropriate procedures and
regulations. '*?

As regards to the slot license, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent’s witnesses from
the MIC and the Government Secretariat Office have claimed that the license was
issued by mistake.!>* The Respondent has argued that the MIC had no authority to issue
the license because of Notice No. 1957 of the Prime Minister and says that the license
was procured by a bribe. Leaving aside the issue of the bribes allegedly paid by the

Claimants, the Tribunal observes that the license was effective for less than ten days

and that the revocation was justified on the lack of authority of the MIC to grant it. The
Tribunal appreciates that Notice No. 1957 refers to the Government and is not explicitly
limited to the Prime Minister’s office but by 2011 Sanum was fully aware that the Prime
Minister’s Office was the essential authority on the Claimants’ gambling ventures in
Laos. The Prime Minister’s Office never approved the Claimants’ gambling project in
Thakhaek. The Claimants had just finished a bruising encounter with the Government
over the Claimants’ failure to fulfill its obligations in respect of the Paksong Hotel and
Casino project. By 2011, the Claimants had entirely failed to live up to their Paksong
commitments, while pretending otherwise. The Claimants had demonstrated

themselves not to be good faith investors.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants were seeking in bad faith (even if not by bribes)
to manipulate Government officials to obtain approvals to which the Claimants were
not entitled. It is significant that the MIC licence was issued to Sanum in February
2011 by the same Minister that was ordered to cancel the Paksan license for lack of

authority one year earlier in February 2010.

Negotiations for the renewal of the Flat Tax Agreement had stalled by March 2011.
The Government was agitating for accountability in respect of its 20% interest in Savan
Vegas. The Claimant alleges that the 16-hectare parcel on Highway 13 was essential
to the success of the Thakhaek project, yet negotiations for the 16-hectare parcel never
reached agreement in the Tribunal’s view. Thus Sanum acquired no rights in Thakhaek
property. There was no Land Concession Agreement for a site on which gambling
facilities could be built. The other approvals that would have been required contingent
on the signing of the Land Concession Agreement (which never happened) became
moot. The Thakhaek project was not expropriated. The licence was revoked for good
and sufficient cause. The project itself never came into legal existence. The MOU
provided that the Claimant’s Thakhaek project could not proceed without “the final
approval of, by or from all Government authorities (central and local)” which was never
obtained. The Tribunal appreciates the chagrin of the Claimant at paying US $400,000
which, in the end, did not result in a viable project but the failure cannot be attributed

to any actionable fault on the part of the Government.

250.

The Tribunal concludes that there is insufficient evidence of bad faith on either side in
respect of Thakhek. It was simply a commercial possibility that never reached the stage

of agreement.

COSTS

The Respondent Government claims costs for the period from 23 February 2017
through 22 February 2019 in respect of lawyers’ fees in the amount of
US$ 1,161,611.48 and expenses of US$ 151,640.83, being in total US$1,313,252.31.
These fees are exclusive of and apart from the costs sought by the Government arising
out of Lao Holdings N.V. v. The Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, which was not consolidated with this case, but for the
most part heard jointly with it. (The Respondent Government claims a total of
$2,780,736.03 in respect of both the ICSID and PCA proceedings). By way of
comparison, the Claimants indicated that if successful (and even if not wholly
successful) they would be seeking $20,929,951.36 in total in respect of both the ICSID
and PCA proceedings. The Claimant’s claim, unlike the Respondent’s claim, does

include the expenses and charges of the respective Secretariats.
Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:

1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and,
if it deems appropriate, in another decision.
2. The term “costs” includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each
arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;

(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required
by the arbitral tribunal;

(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent
such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(ce) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the
arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the
amount of such costs is reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees
and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.

Article 42 of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules provides:

(1) The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful
party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such
costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable,
taking into account the circumstances of the case.

(2) The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in

any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to

another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs.
According to Article 42, the costs of the arbitration “shall in principle be borne by the
unsuccessful party or parties” but grants the Tribunal discretionary power to apportion
costs, based on what is reasonable in the circumstances of the case. While there is some
variation in tribunals’ practices, the prevailing approach of international investment
tribunals is to order costs to follow the event. The Claimants themselves have endorsed
this principle in putting forward their own claim for the “costs and expenses of this

proceeding, including attorneys’ fees”.*

According to the Claimants, the quantum of their original claims if wholly successful,

might have reached US $1 billion.

The costs claim advanced by Sanum and LHNV include US $10,109,872.71 for legal
work prior to the Settlement of 15 June 2014. The Respondent’s claim commences
post-settlement, specifically from 23 February 2017 — ice., after the date Claimant
Sanum filed its Second Material Breach Application before the PCA Tribunal. From
and after 23 February 2017, the two cases (PCA Case No. 2013-13 and ICSID Case No.
ARB(AF)/12/6) proceeded in parallel although, as mentioned, not consolidated.> Thus,
after 23 February 2017, work on all written submissions, evidentiary applications,
interim conferences and hearings as well as the Hearing were combined, then evenly
divided as between the PCA proceedings and the ICSID proceedings. In the result, the
Respondent seeks an order that the Claimant Sanum pay 50% of its legal costs,
including lawyers’ fees and expenses, incurred from 23 February 2017 through the

present.

The Claimant points out that it was successful on a number of the interlocutory matters
including a defeat of the Government’s jurisdictional challenges and establishment in

the Second Material Breach Application, that the Government had failed in two

important aspects to honour the Settlement, namely, the establishment of a new FTA to
assist in the sale of Savan Vegas, and the Government’s failure to halt existing and
potential criminal proceedings. These were important successes for the Claimants, but
in the end, they failed to establish after years of litigation any liability on the part of the
Government in respect of any of their myriad of claims of Treaty violations (as

distinguished from two breaches of the 2014 Settlement Agreement, as mentioned).

In the circumstances the Tribunal thinks it appropriate, in its discretion, to award the

Respondent Government its costs.

8.1. Expenses
8.1.1. Travel Expenses

The Respondent’s travel expenses represent travel to Singapore twice by various
witnesses and the Respondent’s lawyers and staff, for matters involving the Tribunal.
These travel expenses also include travel to Laos, Paris, and Hong Kong for matters

such as fact development, evidence gathering and document review.!°°

8.1.2. Miscellaneous Services and Expenses

The remainder of the Respondent’s expenses relate to services and expenses required
to pursue the arbitrations, some of which were incurred in-house and others by external
vendors. Such services include translation services; court reporter and transcript fees;
express delivery expenses; research; and trial preparation services in Singapore, such

as copying, binding presentations, and creating witness and evidentiary notebooks.

The Respondent’s total expenses (other than legal fees) requested in this arbitration
amount to US $151,640.83.'% This sum, taken together with legal fees of
US $1,161,611.48, produces a total cost award of US $1,313,252.31.
