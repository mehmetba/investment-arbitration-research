PROCEDURAL HISTORY

3.1 Initiation of the Arbitration and Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal

On 8 July 2011, Claimant filed an electronic version of its Request for Arbitration (the
“Request”) with the Secretary-General of ICSID. Hard copies of the Request were filed
with ICSID on 29 August 2011 complete with powers of attorney for Mr. Spyros G.
Alexandris, Mr. Nassos Felonis, Mr. Artan Hajdari, Ms. Elira Kokona, Mr. Emmanouil
Kalogerakis and Ms. Evanthia Mamidaki.

On 29 August 2011, ICSID transmitted a copy of the Request to Respondent.

On 12 September 2011, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request, asked
Respondent to identify the responsible Government authority and invited both Parties “to
inform the Centre of any agreed provisions as to the number of arbitrators and the method
of their appointment.”

On 14 September 2011, Respondent identified the State Advocate Office as the responsible
Government authority.

On 22 September 2011, Respondent proposed that the Tribunal consist of a sole arbitrator,
and on 13 October 2011, Claimant proposed a panel of three arbitrators, one to be
appointed by each Party and the president by agreement of the Parties.

On 7 November 2011, Respondent invoked Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention,
appointed Dr. Yas Banifatemi as arbitrator, and informed ICSID that the Parties agreed on
Paris as the place of arbitration and English as the language of the proceeding. ICSID
affirmed Respondent’s invocation of Article 37(2)(b) on 11 November 2011 and notified
the Parties that Dr. Banifatemi had accepted her appointment on 14 November 2011.

On 16 December 2011, Claimant appointed Mr. Steven A. Hammond as arbitrator. ICSID
notified the Parties on 29 December 2011 that Mr. Hammond had accepted his
appointment.

On 10 January 2012, Claimant invoked Articles 38 and 40(1) of the ICSID Convention,
and on 6 February 2012, ICSID informed the Parties that the Chairman of the

Administrative Council would proceed with the appointment of the President of the
Tribunal in accordance with those provisions.

On 15 February 2012, ICSID proposed Professor Dr. Rolf Knieper as President of the
Tribunal. The Parties raised no objections to the proposal. On 1 March 2012, the
Chairman of the Administrative Council appointed Dr. Knieper. Dr. Knieper accepted his
appointment, and the Secretary-General notified the Parties that the Tribunal had been
constituted that same day.

On 22 February 2012, Respondent informed ICSID and Claimant that Dr. Hamid Gharavi
of Derains & Gharavi would serve as its counsel. Power of Attorney for Dr. Gharavi was
provided on 23 February 2012.

On 20 March 2012, Claimant informed ICSID and Respondent that Dr. Richard Happ of
Luther Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft would serve as its co-counsel. Power of Attorney for Dr.
Happ was provided on 22 March 2012.

3.2 The First Session of the Tribunal

The Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 6 April 2012 in the premises of the
World Bank in Paris, France. In addition to the Tribunal and the Secretary, the following
persons attended the session:

For Claimant:

Dr. Richard Happ

Mr. Spyros G. Alexandris
Ms. Elira Kokona

Mr. Manos Kalogerakis

For Respondent:

Dr. Hamid Gharavi

Ms. Melanie van Leeuwen
Ms. Sophie von Dewall
Mr. Rory V. Wheeler

Ms. Ledina Mandia

Mr. Oltion Toro

During the session, a number of procedural issues were discussed and decided. In
particular, the Parties confirmed:

- that the place of arbitration be Paris, France,

20.

21.

22.

23.

24.

25.

26.

27.

28.

- that the language of the proceeding be English,

that the Rules of the International Bar Association (“IBA”) on the Taking of
Evidence in International Arbitration adopted on 29 May 2010 serve as guidelines,
and

- that the Tribunal had been duly constituted.

The Tribunal and the Parties also set a timetable for the proceeding and agreed that the
question of post-hearing briefs would be decided at the end of the hearing.

Minutes of the session were prepared and sent to the Parties in electronic version on 6
April 2012.

3.3 Further developments before the hearing

On 1 August 2012, Claimant asked for an extension of the time-limit for submitting its
Memorial until 10 August 2012, which was agreed by Respondent and granted by the
Tribunal.

On 10 August 2012, Claimant submitted its Memorial together with eight witness
statements, one expert report on quantum and exhibits.

On 19 November 2012, Respondent asked for an extension of the time-limit for submitting
its Counter-Memorial of two months and twenty-five days for a variety of reasons. On 3
December 2012, Claimant contested the reasons and asked that the request be rejected
except for a short extension of two weeks. On 4 December 2012, the Tribunal granted
Respondent an extension of four weeks and changed the timetable of the subsequent steps
in the proceeding accordingly.

On 4 February 2013, 11 February 2013, and 15 February 2013, the Tribunal made further
revisions to the timetable resulting from the common request of the Parties of 1 February
2014.

On 11 February 2013, Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial together with one
witness statement, one legal expert report, one expert report on damages and exhibits.

On 22 February 2013 and 12 March 2013 the Tribunal further revised the schedule based
on the common request of the Parties.

On 1 March 2013, Respondent requested the disclosure of certain documents allegedly in
Claimant’s possession. On 16 April 2013, Claimant agreed to the production of some of
the documents and rejected the production of others. On 23 April 2013, Respondent

29.

30.

31.

32.

33.

34.

35.

36.

37.

commented Claimant’s reasons for its rejection, and Claimant objected to the comments
arguing that they contradicted the agreed procedure.

On 24 April 2013, the Tribunal decided that Respondent’s comments were admissible, and
on 28 April 2013, the Tribunal ordered the production of certain documents and rejected
the disclosure of others.

On 29 April 2013, Claimant reiterated its objection, and on 30 April 2013 the Tribunal
responded, affirming its decision and the reasons for it.

On 4 July 2013, Claimant requested and Respondent and the Tribunal agreed to an
extension of two days to submit its Reply. The date for Respondent’s submission of its
Rejoinder was accordingly extended.

On 6 July 2013, Claimant submitted its Reply, which comprised a document and an annex.
By correspondence of 12 July 2013 and 15 July 2013, Respondent objected to the format
and requested that the Tribunal order it changed. Claimant responded on 15 July 2013, and
on 16 July 2013 the Tribunal ordered that the documents be merged and set a new date for
its submission.

On 24 July 2013, Claimant submitted the amended Reply.

On 13 September 2013, Respondent requested a two-month extension for the submission
of its Rejoinder. Claimant objected on 18 September 2013, and Respondent replied to the
objections on 19 September 2013.

On 20 September 2013, the Tribunal granted the extension, which it found justified in view
of the difficulties and exceptional circumstances invoked by Respondent, namely a change
of Government that made the collection of information and documents practically
impossible in the timeframe provided, and the fact that the procedural calendar would not
be affected by such extension. The Tribunal further observed that this would not raise due
process issues given that Claimant had submitted its Reply on 6 July 2013, i.e. a little less
than 5 month after Respondent’s Counter-Memorial. On 27 September 2013, Claimant
requested the Tribunal to re-consider its decision, which Respondent objected to. On 1
October 2013, the Tribunal confirmed its decision.

By letter dated 2 December 2013, Respondent requested the bifurcation of the proceeding
into a first phase on jurisdiction and merits and a potential second phase on damages and
quantum. On 16 December 2013, Claimant objected to such bifurcation. The Tribunal
rejected the bifurcation request by a decision of 20 December 2013.

On 3 December 2013, Respondent submitted its Rejoinder, together with a second
quantum expert report, a second expert legal opinion and a further expert legal opinion, a
witness statement and exhibits.

On 10 January 2014, the Parties notified the Tribunal of the identity of the witnesses and
experts whom they wished to call for examination.

On 28 January 2014, Claimant requested that Ms. Michelle George, an attorney not
directly involved in this case, be present during the examination of its witness Mr. Andreas
Tzouros at the hearing. On 3 March 2014, Claimant provided further explanations for its
request, and Respondent objected to the request.

On 25 February 2014, a pre-hearing conference was held via telephone pursuant to ICSID
Arbitration Rule 21. On 26 February 2014, minutes of the pre-hearing telephone
conference were sent to the Parties, and the Parties were notified that an audio recording of
the conference was available on the server created for the case.

On 27 February 2014, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that Mr. James Claxton
would replace Ms. Mairee Uran-Bidegain as Secretary of the Tribunal in the proceeding.
A timetable for the hearing was sent to the Parties on the same date.

On 4 March 2014, the Tribunal rejected Claimant’s request of 28 January 2014 that Ms.
Michelle George be present during Mr. Andreas Tzouros’ examination at the hearing.

On 7 March 2014, Claimant requested a change in the hearing schedule, a provision for the
timing of the Tribunal’s questioning at the hearing, and a global allocation of time at the
hearing. On 10 March 2014, Respondent opposed the requests. On 11 March 2014, the
Tribunal rejected the requests. Following Claimant’s renewal of its request for a global
allocation of time on 12 March 2014, the Tribunal rejected the request again on 14 March
2014, on the basis that the daily schedule agreed by the Parties during the pre-hearing
conference provided sufficient guidance and a fair allocation of time. The Tribunal noted
that it would provide further guidance and, if necessary, make appropriate adjustments at
the opening of each hearing day.

On 12 March 2014, Claimant requested the removal of Mr. Armer Juka from Respondent’s
team on this case and a ruling that he be disallowed from participation at the hearing. On
13 March 2014, Respondent objected to the request, which Claimant supplemented with
accompanying documentation. On 14 March 2014, following an inquiry by the Tribunal,
Respondent confirmed that Mr. Juka had had no access to confidential information of
Claimant. On this basis, the Tribunal rejected Claimant’s request the same day.

3.4 The hearing

at 66, avenue d’Iéna, 75116 Paris, France from 17 to 21 March 2014. In addition to the

3.5 Developments after the hearing

On 21 March 2014, copies of the hearing transcript were sent to the Parties, and on 25
March 2014, ICSID notified the Parties that they could access an audio recording of the
hearing.

On 4 April 2014, Respondent submitted changes to the transcript agreed by the Parties.
Respondent also identified a few changes to the transcript proposed by Claimant and
rejected by Respondent, all concerning transcription of testimony through interpretation.
On the same date, Claimant stated that its proposed changes resulted from mistakes in
interpretation that could be verified by Respondent.

On 8 April 2014, the Tribunal accepted the changes proposed by Claimant on the
understanding that they resulted from mistaken interpretation.

On 15 April 2014, Claimant requested and Respondent agreed to an extension of the
deadline for the filing of the Parties’ submissions on costs. The Tribunal confirmed the
extension on the same day.

On 22 April 2014, the Parties filed their respective submissions on costs.

The Tribunal carefully assessed the Parties’ positions and the evidence put forward by the
Parties in series of oral and written deliberations, with a last deliberation in Paris on 8 and
9 January 2015. The Tribunal’s completion of this Award was delayed because of the
failure of the Parties to timely pay the advance on funds requested on 25 November 2014.

The proceeding was closed on 4 March 2015.

THE FACTS OF THE DISPUTE

4.1 The uncontested facts

The dispute concerns allegations by Claimant that Respondent violated the Greece-Albania
BIT in its treatment of investments made by Claimant in connection with the construction
and operation of an oil container terminal on a land plot in the Durres port area and the
creation and operation of company owned and company operated petrol stations (COCOs)
in the country.

Given the profound and sometimes abrupt political, economic, social and cultural changes
in Albania, it is apparent that facts emerged, events evolved and decisions were taken on
several levels in a dense rhythm not always appropriately synchronized or documented: the
developments concerned the level of concrete and individual commercial relations with
foreign and national investors, the level of legislative reform and the level of institutional
and governance reform, the latter two being partly accompanied by international
organizations such as the World Bank. Although not always assisted by consistent
evidence or terminology, the Tribunal finds, after a careful analysis of the Parties’ written
submissions, the exhibited evidence, oral presentations by counsel, and the testimony
provided by witnesses and experts, that the following facts are uncontested.

In August 1991, the BIT was concluded.

In November 1993, Respondent implemented a new foreign investment law, superseding
an earlier law from August 1992. The law’s purpose was to attract foreign investment.

At around the same time, Respondent’s Ministry of Public Works and Transport (the
predecessor to the Durres Port Authority) published a brochure to promote investment in
the port of Durres, stating that “[a]t the port of Durrés all sorts of goods, minerals, fuels,
cements and other bulk articles are loaded and unloaded,” and noting that “[i]nvestmens
[sic] in the development of the infrastrcture [sic] of the eastern wharves [the area where
Claimant’s investment was eventually materialized] are indispensable . . . nae
Claimant’s business relations with Albania date back to the 1980s. When the regime
changed, Claimant decided to build on these relations and to invest at an early stage in a
country that had shaken off its centrally-planned economy and political regime and moved
towards a market economy and democracy.

Albania’s transition to the rule of law, democracy and a market economy was naturally
difficult and at times chaotic with governance structures being weak and developing
slowly.>

From 1991 on, Claimant explored different commercial opportunities in different locations
in the sector of its major business activities, which are centered on the transport, storage
and trade of petroleum related products.

On December 16, 1994, three years after its first site visit to the port of Durres, Claimant
submitted by fax an initial investment proposal to Mr. Artan Sevrani, seeking to renovate
the existing tank farm. Mr. Sevrani’s role and function has not been explained in this
proceeding.* There is no evidence that the Albanian authorities answered this proposal.

Claimant made a second investment proposal, on June 30, 1995, in which it identified and
presented three potential sites “suitable for erection” of a tank farm, listed in order of
preference as the port of Durres, Porto Romano, and Vlora. There is no evidence it
received an official reply.

After having “identified and presented three potential sites for the construction of tank
farms” ® Claimant came to the conclusion that the port of Durres was the most appropriate
choice. It thus made proposals to Albanian authorities to build a tank farm in the port and
rehabilitate part of the existing port infrastructure to discharge vessels. Claimant also
proposed to create COCOs in the country,’ assuming “that the necessary piece of land,
after being finally selected, shall be allocated to us by the Albanian Government at a
nominal price” ®

The proposals were based on a document which Claimant has presented as a business plan
(hereinafter the “business plan”), which foresaw the installation of the tank farm and “a
network of gas stations operating under the Jetoil sign”. The gas stations were decisive
for the viability of the project, and there is a common understanding between all financial
experts that without them “you will never have a profitable investment’, as clearly
expressed by Claimant’s witness T. Stamatelopoulos’” who was in charge of the financial
administration of Claimant's subsidiaries from 2006 to 2008.'!

During the times of the ancien régime, petroleum products were already imported to the
port of Durres. It is the most important port in the country, conveniently close to the capital
Tirana, and has an infrastructure (pipeline and jetty) and tanks of the former state-owned
petroleum company. These structures were severely run down and in a state of disrepair at
the moment of the regime change.

The port is situated close to a residential area.

Two other Greek companies applied for work authorization and have invested in
petroleum-storage facilities in the port.

”? and it is not contested that

Claimant states that it was “encouraged to invest in Albania
it was able to “obtain some support from the Republic of Albania” which Respondent states
was “purely provisional and high lever”.3 During a number of meetings with high-level
Albanian Government officials, including the Prime Minister and several Ministers,
members of Claimant’s senior management received oral assurances that the investment
was welcome. Although the exact timing of these meetings is unclear, at least one key
meeting took place in 1998 before Claimant sought approval of its investment. 4

At about the same time, Albania established contacts with international public institutions
such as the World Bank and the European Union and solicited financial and professional
assistance for the modernization and development of its public infrastructure. As part of
those discussions, Albania executed with the International Development Association
(IDA), a member of the World Bank Group, a credit agreement for an amount of 17
Million USD, dated 9 June 1998, for the financing of the “Durres Port Project”.!* The
purpose of the project and credit was to increase commercialization by modernizing the
port facilities and by establishing an autonomous port. 6

On 3 July 1998, Claimant submitted a request to the Albanian Minister of Economy and

73. The request was renewed on 10 November 1998 and extended to include a long-term lease

contract.

74. On 28 July 1998, Albania approved the IDA credit by Law No. 8383 “On the Ratification
of the Development Credit Agreement”. The law entered into force on August 10, 1998.'°

75. Part of the project financed by IDA was a study, which was carried out by the US-based
consulting company Louis Berger Inc.” The survey mandate is described in the
“Addendum to Contract No. 3068-2” between the Albanian Ministry of Transport, Project
Implementation Unit and Louis Berger, Inc. dated 17 December 1998: “The [latter]
company was retained to ‘advise the Port of Durres Authority on the rationalization of
present land use commensurate with current port operations, and to advise on land
allocation for possible future development scenarios val

76. The study resulted in a “Land Use Plan” of March 2000 also called the “Master Plan”.”?
One of the recommendations of this plan was the transformation of the port of Durres into
a container terminal and the relocation of the oil tanks to a less-populated area.”>

77. When Claimant prepared its business plan in March 1998 and submitted its requests in July
and November 1998, there was no indication that in the future the port of Durres would be
closed to the landing of petroleum products. Claimant chose the location for its
geographical, infrastructural and institutional convenience. According to clear and
uncontested answers of two senior members of Claimant’s management, they would not
have started the investment in Durres had they known at the time about plans of re-zoning
the port and would have been hesitant to invest in Albania at all.”

78. By letter dated 6 January 1999, the Directorate of Maritime Port of the Ministry of Public
Works and Transport informed the Privatization Directorate of the same Ministry that by
“Decision of the Board of Directors No. 130, dated 12.12.1998, it is approved in principle
the establishment of a center of fuel reservoirs accounting for a construction-mounting

value of 6 million USD in a surface of 14 thousand square meters in the southern side of
the existing reservoirs [...!” and asked the Privatization Directorate to proceed
accordingly.”>

79. By letter dated 6 January 1999, the Directorate of Enterprise Administration &
Privatization in the Ministry of Public Works and Transport informed the Ministry of
Public Economy and Privatization that “the Administrative Board has approved in
principle the establishment of a centre of reservoirs in the technological zone of the port”
and that it agreed to grant a lease to Claimant.”

80. During its visits to Albania, Claimant made efforts to associate with a local partner. At
least in part, these efforts were guided by the wish to rely on an Albanian partner for
contacts with the Albanian authorities and to facilitate the granting of permits.” In 1999,
Claimant entered into an association agreement with the Albanian partner “ANOIL Sh.A”,
and created the Albanian subsidiary “Mamidoil Albanian”, which was incorporated on 15
March 1999.78 Initially, Claimant held 80% and ANOIL 20% of the shares. From its
incorporation, one person from Claimant’s senior management and the owner of ANOIL,
Mr. Angjeli, acted as general director and vice general director respectively. In 2006,
Claimant bought the minority shares to become the sole shareholder in the subsidiary.

81. On 2 June 1999, a lease contract was executed between the Ministry of Public Economy
and Privatization and Claimant’s Albanian subsidiary Mamidoil Albanian, represented by
Mr. Aleksander Mamidakis. The contract covered roughly 14 thousand square meters of a
“free site” in the port of Durres for the purpose of “setting up a fuel storage center
according to the business plan attached” (Article 2). The term of the contract was 20 years,
i.e. until 1 June 2019 (Article 3), unless terminated by agreement of the Parties or “when
the lessee violates one of the liabilities provided in articles 10-15” Article 16). The lessor
was “bound to guarantee the full enjoyment of the facility” (Article 6), while the lessee was
“duty bound to use the facility, scope of such contract for the purpose and destination
foreseen in article 2” (Article 12).

° CE-13.

?° Claimant has submitted two versions of the lease contract, as CE-19 of the Request for Arbitration and CE-19a of
the Memorial, the former documenting the calculation of the rent and the latter documenting a “schedule of
investment performance”, allegedly corresponding to the “business plan attached” as mentioned in Article 2 of the
lease contract: Cl. Mem., para. 70. Respondent doubts the authenticity and the completeness of either version
because the originally attached maps are mi ig, and submits that it is completely unfamiliar with the “schedule of
investment performance”: Resp. C-Mem., para. 52, Resp. Rej., para. 67. The maps alluded to are documented in RE-
14. Claimant refutes the allegations as being “not credible” and insists that the schedule corresponds to the business
plan which is described as being attached to the contract: Cl. Rep., para. 88. During the hearing, it became apparent

Upon instruction of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, the Durres port authority
handed the site over to Claimant’s subsidiary on 1 September 1999, “free cleared and
ready for the investment of a fuel storage center”.*°
Upon reception of the letters approving the investment in principle, the execution of the
lease contract and the transfer of the site, Claimant prepared for the construction of the
tank farm and the rehabilitation of the infrastructure.

The Tribunal had some difficulties to establish the exact time-line of the construction.
While Claimant’s Request for Arbitration alleges that “approximately 85% of the Project
had been completed in November 1999”,*' Claimant’s Memorial contends that it “began
with the construction of the tank farms in February 2000”, and Claimant’s Reply
specifies that it took “‘six months from the handing over of the site (September 99) to the
signing of the main civil works contract”. During the hearing, Claimant stated that the
date indicated in the Request for Arbitration “is flatly incorrect’. In the “Timeline”
preceding its Rejoinder, Respondent submits that the construction of the tank farm had not
begun — as claimed in Claimant’s chronology — before October 1999 to be completed in
February 2001, but that, from April to October 2001, Claimant “invest{[ed] substantial
funds in the construction of additional fifth and biggest tank farm?>

The Tribunal deduces from the various submissions that it is uncontested between the
Parties that the core construction period was between March 2000 and February 2001, with
a suspension of works of about 5 months from July to December 2000. That is all the more
so since it is equally uncontested that Claimant started to discharge vessels in October
2001 and continued to do so until the ban to discharge fuel from vessels in the port of
Durres became effective in 2009.*° In total, 202 vessels were discharged during this period.
Thus, from October 2001 at the latest, the reservoirs and the discharging infrastructure
must have been operative.

On 17 November 1999, the Director of the Durres Sea Port Authority, operating under the
supervision of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport wrote a letter to “Mamidoil
Albania shpk” stating, “[d]espite our verbal notification for suspending the works for the
construction of the fuel depots close to the eastern docket of this Port, you pay no attention
to it and continue with the works. Under these circumstances, the Authority informs you

that Article 2 refers to Claimant’s business plan of 31 March 1998 as exhibited as CE-58 and that the plan was in the
files but not attached as part of the lease contract.

again to suspend the works immediately until the completion of the master plan survey for
the development of this Port, which is due to be completed in January 2000. On the
contrary, we are going to recourse to the assistance of competent authority to affect [sic]
forced suspension. 737

By letter dated 7 December 1999, Claimant’s Albanian partner and deputy general director
in Mamidoil Albanian refuted the content of this letter and insisted, “[s]o, Mr Director of
Durres Port, it should be known that this country is regulated by laws and decisions should
be abided by, including the respect for your signature and seal, which you cannot change
through verbal decisions, be it even through letters, which run counter to the laws of the
state. [...] We consider this letter as an unfair pressure, hindering the foreign investors
and the country [...]. Under these circumstances, were [sic] should be the ones to seek the
assistance of the competent authorities for you not to become an obstacle”.**

By letter dated 15 February 2000, the Director of the Durres Sea Port Authority reiterated
its warning to Mamidoil Albanian and repeated that given the first consultations with the
experts on the revision of the master plan “it seems ungrounded and irrelevant to construct
terminals and deposits of fuels at the sea port’. The letter advised not to construct before
the completion of the survey because “[iJnstalling them would be of financial
consequences to your company.”*®

In a memorandum dated 3 March 2000, addressed to the Chairman of the Council of
Ministers and copied to Mr. Aleksander Mamidakis, “Mamidoil” Albania sha, the Director
of the Durres Sea Port Authority summarized the situation. It referred to the results of the
recommendations for a new master plan for Durres according to which “no sites available
for fuel deposits shall continue to exist’, by referring to the request for “a provisional
suspension of the works in that site until the completion and approval of the master plan”,
and by informing the Chairman that construction is “being continued and the investor is
making payments, while the perspective is not safe.”

The attitude of Claimant with respect to these exchanges has evolved over the course of the
proceedings. While originally pleading that Respondent had “[s]uddenly and out of the
blue” changed its plans for the port and had informed the investors only on 13 June 2000
when most of the construction work had already been completed,"! it stated at the hearing
that it is “willing to accept the evidence suggests that those letters, at least one of them has
been received and has been replied to.” At the same time, counsel for Claimant alleged

that he had “shown those letters to our witnesses and our witnesses said, ‘Well, 14 years
ago, who knows?’. They are not in the archives”. Claimant insists that the letters were
received by Mamidoil Albanian and that “Mamidoil Albanian is not Claimant in this case;
it is Mamidoil. Whether anything which is in the sphere of a subsidiary must be imputed to

the mother company is a legal question which I am currently not prepared to answer."

Claimant’s witness Mr. Alexandros Mamidakis testified that he saw the letter sent by the
Director of the Durres Sea Port Authority on 17 November 1999 during the construction
period but that he does not recall the exact month,*> while another of Claimant’s witnesses,
Mr. Nikolaos Mamidakis, testified that he saw it after March/April 2000.*°

The World Bank endorsed the recommendations of the March 2000 Louis Berger study,
including the proposal to relocate fuel-related activities to a less populated area, in its
supervision mission aide-mémoire of 14 July 2000 where it “reiterate[d] its earlier
recommendation, that the Government ask the company to relocate its tank farm to an
unpopulated site near Durres as soon as possible, which appears quite feasible. [...]
Minister Nako told the mission that the Government and company would study this matter
over the next two to three years with a view to relocating the tank farm. The Government
will also need to identify funds to compensate the company for moving”.”
The World Bank has maintained its position through the years and maintained its policy
assistance in its implementation completion report of 24 June 2005."

The European Commission has equally endorsed the new orientation of Durres port, as
expressed in the “First Five-Year Review of Albanian National Transport Plan (ANTP)”,
established again by Louis Berger Inc. Part of the plan consisted in the “[rlemoving or
relocating the oil product tank farm and implement an environmental clean-up of the
site.” In 2008, the European Commission stated that the “condition of the present oil
jetty, along the eastern breakwater, is deplorable [...]. The construction work for a
Greenfield petroleum port at Porto Romano are in execution. A transfer of oil imports to
the new port is expected to take place around 2009-2010. In view of the condition of the
jetty in the Port of Durres, it is important that the commissioning of the new facility
proceeds without delay.”

On 13 June 2000, Respondent’s Council of Ministers approved the Land Use Plan
elaborated under the auspices of IDA, and the decision was published in the Official
Gazette.*!

Subsequent to the decision, the Minister of Public Economy and Privatization and the
Minister of Transport informed Claimant by letter dated 21 July 2000 that “it is not
foreseen that the zone in which the fuel deposits are actually located, will serve for this
purpose in the future. The plan determines the displacement of the existing deposits outside
the Durres Port and the stopping of the construction of new deposits. [...] [T]aking into
consideration the fact that based on the contractual obligations, that on your part you are
investing in the reconstruction or construction of new deposits in this zone, based on the
new requirements [...] we demand the interruption of further investments”.

As a consequence, all petroleum companies active in port of Durres had to abandon their
construction sites between July and December 2000. The instruction of the Ministries of
Public Economy and Privatization and of Transport referred explicitly to the “Plan of
Utilization of the land in Durres Port” which stipulated the closing of existing fuel deposits
and a ban on the construction of new ones in Durres.**

The ban was lifted in December 2000 after an intervention of the Greek Government,
Greece being one of the major trading partners of Albania.’ After negotiations between
high-level Albanian authorities, which included the Prime Minister and several Ministers,
and the senior management of Claimant and other Greek companies operating in Durres
port, assisted by Greek Government officials, the Albanian Council of Ministers issued
Decision No. 704, dated 21 December 2000. The decision referred to the Constitution and
the “Law on the Processing, Transporting and Trading of Petroleum, Gas and their By-
Products” and introduced the concept of a “temporary trading permit” to entities
conducting their activity in trading petroleum and their by-products in Durres (Article 1.5

On 16 February 2001, the Minister of Economy and Privatization issued a “Trade Permit”
of type “A” to Mamidoil Albanian and other subsidiaries of Greek companies “valid for a
period of 18 months after the entry into power of the Decision for the displacement of
deposits in the port of Durres, but not longer then [sic] 10 years”.© The permit referred to
Decision No. 704 and was issued on the basis of an application made by Deputy Director

General, Mr. Angjeli, in the name of Mamidoil Albanian, which itself referred to that
37

decision.
On 27 January 2011, shortly before the expiry of the trading license, Claimant approached
the National Licensing Center in order to prepare an application for its renewal. The
application was not processed. Since the reserve requirements were also not met, Claimant
“did not start a second application for a trading license,”** and the trading license expired
on 15 February 2011.

There has been some debate as to the term of the validity of the trading license. While
Claimant contests its legality based on its temporary character™ and Respondent considers
it valid, Claimant’s witness Mr. Kalfas confirmed that the 10-year restriction was “normal”
and accepted as long as renewable and that only a further 18-month restriction after a
relocation order would have been illegal. Ultimately, the Tribunal finds that the factual
issues are moot because, on the one hand, no relocation order was issued and, on the other
hand, Claimant refrained from making a further application in any event.

The legal significance of Claimant’s request for the approval of the investment of 3 July
1998, the issue of the permits and authorizations that were required from Claimant for it to
proceed with its investment, and the subsequent approval by the Ministry of Public Works
and Transport will be analyzed in due time. In any event, it is beyond doubt that the Parties
were aware that further documentation and permits were required for the construction and
operation of the tank farm. Claimant underlined their necessity when it noted that it was
prepared to get “the respective permits for the accomplishment of the works,” and for its
part Respondent referred to additional authorization by expressing its approval for the
project “in principle” in January 1999.

In addition to the trade permit, the Tribunal takes note of the following dates of events and
legislative acts requesting permits:

a) The environmental permit: In 1998, Law No. 7664 “On Environmental Protection”

dated 21 March 1993 was in force. Its objective was to protect the environment being
ial condition for providing for the develoy of the society
and the nation in general” (Article 1) and stipulated that persons engaged “in
economic and social activities that may have an impact on environment, must obtain
licenses” (Article 17) before any construction. In this context, “industrial activities”
(Article 18 c) were to be licensed by the National Agency for Environmental
Protection (Article 19). The request for a license was not submitted to specific formal

considered “an

requirements and was to be responded to within three months (Article 20).°' Law No.
7664 was abrogated and replaced by Law No. 8934 of 5 September 2002. The new
law required a periodically-renewable environmental permit for the “operation of
i llations for their utilization and technological processing and other activities”
(Article 36), issued by the Minister of Environment upon request of the interested
party (Articles 36/39). Both laws provide that in case of passivity of the competent
authority the permit is considered approved. Claimant applied for the permit on 10
May 2000 with the Regional Environmental Agency and was granted the
Environmental Permit on 31 May 2007 by the Minister of Environment “for a
temporary term, till the moment of the displacement of tanks in the final location”.
The granting of the environmental permit had been preceded by some correspondence
with and an inspection by the Ministry.“

The construction site permit and the construction permit: When Claimant made its
application on 3 July 1998, Law No. 7693 “On Urban Planning” was still in force.
According to its Article 7, the “Council of Territory Adjustment of Albania’,
established by the Council of Ministers “approved [...] construction projects
execution in which the building site is more than 0.5. hectare’. For smaller sites a
construction permit by local government was required (Article 29). In any
constellation, the application had to be made using certain forms that were attached to
the law.

On 18 November 1998, Claimant wrote to the Minister of Industry stating that
“[a]fter concluding a preliminary but substantial stage of data selection and
consideration, as well as discussions with the proper authorities in Albania, we are
now ready to submit our proposal to your Government regarding the construction
and operation of a tank farm [...]. We would highly appreciate it if you could let us
have your final views on the subject as well as on the procedure to be followed for its
implementation”. The letter was accompanied by a technical description, a detailed
design of the depot and a memorandum of the project.” Subsequent to this letter and
the request of 3 July 1998, the Albanian Government approved the project in
principle and executed the lease contract. At that time, a new Law No. 8405 “On
Urban Planning”, dated 17 September 1998, had entered into force, repealing Law

No. 7693 (Article 86). Articles 38/39 of the Law provided that before the
construction of a surface structure a formal request for a building site permit had to be
submitted to the respective urban planning offices, using a form (“Form No. 1”) as
attached to the Law, and Articles 45 to 53 of the Law provided that in addition any
person wanting to build in Albania had to request a building permit. The request had
to be addressed to the urban planning section in Durres before the beginning of the
construction and in a formal way, using a Form attached to the Law. Buildings
constructed without permits were qualified as being “illegal” (Article 76), the
decisive moment of the applicability of the law being the time of construction (Article
77). Buildings constructed without permit in approved sites are considered illegal.
The Tirana municipal territory adjustment council (TAC) “shall issue building
permits when construction meets the requirement of this law” (Articles 78/79). For
illegal buildings constructed before the entry into force of the law and constructed
without permit on land of which the builder is the owner, the authority may grant a
permit retroactively (Article 77).

While the legal frame is not in dispute, the question whether Claimant’s different
requests and applications are expressions of a request for a construction site and a
construction permit remain controversial and will be presented and considered in due
course.

The exploitation permit: According to Law No. 8402 “On Control and Regulation of
the Construction works” dated 10 September 1998, Claimant needed an exploitation
permit which was to be issued by the “section or local unit urban office” (Articles
8/13). By letters from the Ministry of Economy, the Chief of Trading and
Concessions Permit Department, and the Ministry of Industry dated 23 April 2003,
20 May 2003 and 30 March 2004” respectively, the Albanian authorities requested
that Claimant apply for it.”' While it is uncontested that such permit was not granted,
the existence of the application is in dispute: Respondent denies that an application
was made” while Claimant asserts that it was not able to produce the original
application but that contemporaneous documents evidence that it was made.”

20

f) The customs warehouse authorization: On 17 October 2006, the Customs Office
issued, upon Claimant’s request submitted on 10 October 2006, a definitive
“Authorization for the Administration of a Customs Warehouse.”

 

104. Claimant maintains that it based its decision to start the construction of the tank farm in
October 1999 on the following documents: the January 1999 inter-ministerial letter
carrying the approval in principle, the June 1999 lease contract between the Ministry of
Public Economy and Privatization and Mamidoil Albanian, the September 1999 minutes of
transfer of the site, and the February 2001 trade permit in favour of Mamidoil Albanian.
Claimant accepts that a construction site permit, a construction permit and an exploitation
permit were not obtained following the requirements of Albanian law.”>

105. There has also been some debate whether the inter-ministerial letters approving the
investment in principle and the lease contract could be considered a construction permit.
Based on the opinion of its legal expert, Prof. Dobjani, Claimant has expressed its
position.”® While Prof. Dobjani’s written analysis may be ambiguous,” the ambiguity was
lifted during his oral testimony when he stated unambiguously — in agreement with
Respondent’s legal expert — that the inter-ministerial letter was not an approval in the sense
of the Law on Urban Planning “but just a positive opinion that the land they were asking
for [...] was available for investment” and that “the lease contract is not a construction
permit, of course.””

106. During their oral testimony, both legal experts also confirmed, when asked whether
“questions relating to permits and regulations in construction activities are of importance
as opposed to being trivial”,®° that they are important because they touch on “upon safety,

health and urban questions.”*!

107. Finally, after having confirmed that no construction permits were in place, both legal
experts agreed that “[t]he construction police had full authority and full opportunities to go
and close down that construction, if the Port Authority had informed them. But they could
have been informed also by the Ministry of Public Works or the Ministry of Economy, by
informing the central construction police, because the construction police operates at the

central level and local level. So it had full powers and the full opportunities to go and close
down and stop the construction.”

The construction police did not ever exercise this right. When the construction work was
interrupted from July to December 2000, this decision was explicitly based on relocation
plans and not on the absence of permits.

For 12 years, Claimant has imported, transported and marketed oil products in Albania.
During the period from October 2001, shortly after the completion of the tank farm
construction, until June 2009, the moment when the prohibition to process ships in the port
of Durres became effective, that activity took place largely by sea transport to the port of

license until shortly before its expiry in 2011.

Durres.

During the period of operations, a number of factual events occurred, regulatory changes
were introduced and governmental decisions were taken, which affected Claimant’s
activity in different ways.

In line with European standards, Albania introduced and maintained requirements for a
security reserve of fuel for wholesalers, which increased from 30 days in 1999 to 60 days
in 2003 to 90 days in 2010.** At the same time, from 2002 onwards, Albania introduced a
minimum reserve requirement of 300 cubic meters®> for small local dealers, which would
only be applicable in practice “if the sales quantities were very small, almost unrealistic.”*©

Another problem concerned the quality of diesel to be marketed. By Decision No. 147
dated 21 March 2007, the Albanian Government fixed a progressive standard of diesel
quality to be traded on the Albanian market.*”

By Decision No. 1110 dated 30 July 2008, the Albanian Government allowed the refining
of a lower diesel quality in Albania and its marketing, again tightening the criteria
progressively between 2010 and 2012.8

period of time: H. Tr., day 1, page 56.

By Decision No. 52 dated 14 January 2009, the Albanian Government allowed the refinery
ARMO S.A. to sell its products of lower quality to wholesalers endowed with “Trade
License Type A”, and “due to its dominant position in the market [...] at the same and
transparent trading prices and conditions” (Article 3 of the Decision). The standard was
again progressively increased between 2010 and 2012.

Decision No. 52 was in force for six months. The Constitutional Court of Albania voided it
on 24 July 2009. The Court found that the Decision contradicted the Stabilization and
Association Agreement with the European Union and the Albanian Constitution because it
curtailed the economic freedom, which is not within the competence of the executive
power.””

A further problem concerned the taxation of imported fuel. Claimant has alleged that the
customs authorities taxed its imports based on the bill of lading quantities and not based on
the quantities that left its bonded warehouse in the port. Both quantities differ because of
evaporation and loss during storage, the outturn quantity being lower.

Claimant repeatedly complained about the taxation practice from 23 April 20037! and filed
a suit for reimbursement of allegedly overpaid taxes with the District Court of Durres on
13 June 2006.” The District Court accepted its jurisdiction, but this was overturned by a
decision of the Supreme Court dated 3 April 2007. Claimant appealed this decision to the
Constitutional Court.”? The Constitutional Court rejected the request on 24 December
2007." Claimant then brought the case to the European Court of Human Rights in
Strasburg on 16 June 2009, where it is pending and awaiting the Court’s examination of
admissibility.”

Although they appraise the issue in a different context and perspective in general, the
Parties concur that smuggling and adulteration of fuel has been a problem in Albania and
the region from before the start of Claimant’s operations.”°

When on 21 July 2000 Respondent ordered the interruption of construction with a view to
moving the tank farms, Claimant addressed a letter to the Albanian Government asking it
to allow the completion of the first stage of the project and the beginning of the “operation
to be on a short term basis with respect to time and concurrently to collaborate towards

reestablishing the project altogether”.°" The above-mentioned temporary trading license
explicitly took a future displacement into account.

. On 27 May 2001, Respondent issued Decision 358 on “Procedures and Conditions for
Granting Permits, for Construction and Use of Coastal Installations, for the Transport and
Storage of Oil, Gas and their By-Products”. Article 9 of the Decision granted priority in
the selection of sites in the newly-identified zones for the operation of seashore deposits in
Porto Romano and Vlora to all “[s]ubjects which are in contractual relationship with the
state for depositing in the Port of Durres”.°®

. On 26 October 2001, Claimant suspended its original business plan and decided to “freeze”
the plan to create a network of COCOs.” On 19 December 2003, the plan was definitively
abandoned and replaced by the strategy to operate through supply contracts with
independent partners.'° As expressed by Claimant’s counsel, “Claimant first suspended
and then later stopped its plans for investing a further 15 million in the chain of
cocos”.'"!

. It is against this background that a high-level working group “[o]n the displacement of the
fuel deposits from Durres Port” was established in 2003, grouping key Ministries and the
three Greek companies operating in Durres, including Claimant. The group met several
times in early 2003. Three of the meetings — of 12 February 2003, of 27 February 2003 and
of 20 March 2003 — have been documented in minutes.'°

. While during the first two meetings practical problems of relocation from Durres to other
ports were discussed, with Claimant’s representative insisting on the necessity of financial
compensation, the third meeting centered on the lack on approvals, authorizations and
permits, possibly induced by a remark of Claimant’s representative who had complained
during the second meeting that what “has main importance is the lack of authorization of
use and exploitation” of the tank farm. 103

During these meetings, the Albanian authorities stated that a number of authorizations and
approvals were missing and that the “[s]tate handled the matter with some leniency,
because of its will not to hold back your activity. [...] the Albanian authorities would be
willing to consider the possibilities to legitimize your activity, provided that an agreement
is reached on the continuation of your activity in the port of Durres, until the decision for
the relocation of the fuel storage deposits.” During the meeting, Claimant’s representative

when the investment is the best in the Balkans
By letter dated 23 April 2003, the Minister of Economy asked the Greek companies
operating in Durres, with a copy to the Greek Embassy in Tirana, to file the documentation
necessary to issue exploitation permits and construction permits. '°

By letter dated 30 March 2004, The Minister of Industry and Energy informed the Minister
of Economy that after the discussions of the Albanian-Greek commission in 2003, the
companies operating in the port of Durres had been asked to present all the documents
necessary for the certification of the tanks at their earliest convenience and that the
certification would follow immediately thereafter, but none of the Greek companies had
submitted the necessary information. 106

When Respondent communicated to Mamidoil Albanian for the first time in 1999 that it
was considering a new land use in the port of Durres and asked it to suspend the
construction of the tank farm, the alternative port of Porto Romano had no infrastructure
and had no capacity to support the landing of petroleum products from vessels. The
Government announced in 2003 that the necessary infrastructure was to be created. The
construction of the port commenced in 2004 and lasted until 2009. In July 2009, Porto
Romano was officially opened.'””

After the completion of the construction in 2001, Respondent suggested that Claimant
relocate the tank farm to Porto Romano at its own costs, in light of its previous warnings
on the change of legal framework. Claimant consistently refused this invitation, demanding
compensation for any relocation. The Tribunal also notes that, in this arbitration, Claimant
complained that it was never “ordered” to relocate, a complaint that was never made at the
time of the events and which, in any event, would not advance Claimant’s case.

On 6 October 2006, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Energy announced that “in due
time” the Government would take the necessary measures to prohibit import-export
activities of oil, gas and related products in other ports than Porto Romano and Vlora. 108

On 10 May 2007, the Albanian Government entered into a settlement agreement with
Petrolifera, a petroleum company based in Italy, and Petrolifera Italo Albanese Sh.A. in
order to terminate a dispute that Petrolifera had brought before the ICC International Court
of Arbitration. In the agreement the

On 25 July 2007, Respondent issued Decision No. 486 of the Council of Ministers ordering
the “interrupt{ion of] the activity of processing ships transporting petroleum, gas and their
by-products in the ports of Durres and Shengjin, within 18 months from entry into force of
such decision.”''°

Claimant and the other Greek operators protested, and the effective date was postponed
until 30 June 2009. As from 1 July 2009, the date when Porto Romano was officially
opened, no more vessels were allowed to unload in the port of Durres. ut

By letter dated 29 April 2008, the Albanian Minister of Economy, Trade and Energy
informed the Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs that the decision concerned only the use of
the port and the processing of ships and left both the lease contract and the trading license
intact.'! By letter dated 14 April 2010, Respondent notified Claimant that the decision to
prohibit the unloading of petroleum products by ship did “not impede the activity of
company Mamidoil Albanian sh.a. for depositing and trading naphtha sub-products in the
rented zone in the territory of Durres harbor, neither does it violate the rights of your
company to trade as provided by ‘commercial permission’ no. 52, dated 16.02.2001 given
to the company by the Ministry.” HS

By letter dated 25 January 2008, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Energy reiterated
Respondent’s offer to grant priority to the Greek companies operating in Durres for the
selection of a relocation site in Porto Romano. ''*

By letter of 22 February 2008, Claimant replied that “by virtue of the Agreement that was
signed on 2.6.1999 concerning the granted land that we already legally possess [...] our

company in principle would not object to relocate to the area designated by your
Government, this being conditioned upon the provision of all indispensable prerequisites
towards this end, namely the creation of the necessary infrastructure in order to support
the relocation”. Claimant further requested “sufficient and effective compensation for the
investment that we have already materialized”. us

By letter dated 11 March 2008, the Ministry of Economy rejected the request for
compensation arguing that Claimant was “fully aware that such processing activity in the
port [of Durres] would have been temporary”. 16

No compensation was agreed upon. The relocation did not take place. Despite the
continuing validity of the lease contract for the site in Durres port, the tank farm ceased
being used. Claimant’s Albanian subsidiary is currently acting as a sales agent for
Claimant on a very low scale. i

4.2 The contestation and/or controversial appreciation of facts

At the closure of the hearing, it became apparent that the majority of the core facts are not
disputed between the Parties. The controversy concerns mostly the factual and legal
appreciation of certain events, the evolution of the context, and decisions that either Party
has taken. The Tribunal will present and summarize the respective positions of the Parties,
necessarily recalling some uncontested facts and being aware that the legal and factual
appreciation is intertwined and might have to be taken up again later in the Award. The
Tribunal has carefully analyzed the positions. When it does not refer specifically to one or
the other fact, it has done so because it has concluded that it was either not substantiated or
not relevant for the Award.

4.2.1 Claimant’s position

Claimant asserts that it has extremely carefully planned its investment in Albania. It had an
intensive general knowledge of the country and the region since it had already established
business relations with the ancien régime in the 1980s by exporting coking coal to Albania
and petroleum products to other countries. When the regime changed, Claimant intensified
contacts with the new authorities and explored the geographical, economic and social
factors and perspectives of the emerging market economy.

Claimant concentrated its research on its core business, i.e. the transport, storage and trade
of petroleum products. All operative shareholders of the Mamidoil Jetoil companies, the
members of senior management as well as key employees for commercial, technical and
financial questions travelled to Albania to identify and specify business opportunities.

Claimant looked for the appropriate port that could be used for landing petroleum products
and their storage and compared the three ports of Durres, Porto Romano and Vlora. Durres
was the only port conveniently located and equipped with infrastructure while Porto
Romano was practically non-existent and Vlora was far away from the economic center.
No further disadvantages were detectable.

Claimant looked for local partners, not least to be well informed about all legal and
regulatory requirements for the creation of modern storage facilities and retail gas stations.
The local partner would be entrusted with the procedures to receive all necessary permits
and authorizations. This is clearly expressed in a letter from Mr. Alexandros Mamidakis to
Mr. Llazar Angjeli, the owner of the ultimate local partner, dated 15 March 2000, where he
asks for assistance for “any problems with the authorities during the execution of the
project and that we always have all the necessary permits and approvals.”| is

When Claimant bought the local subsidiary’s minority shares in 2006, it did so partly
because it was “not happy with this specific partner” and partly because it planned to be
listed on the Alternative Investment Market in London.'!”

After several years of diligent planning which included numerous discussions with the
Prime Minister, line Ministers and high technical Government officials, Claimant informed
the Government for the first time in writing in 1995 that it had chosen the port of Durres as
its first choice for the location of the tank farm and asked for the designation of a site. The
Government responded enthusiastically and endorsed the choice.

In his witness statement, Mr. Alexandros Mamidakis described the interaction as follows:

6. Based on a twenty year business plan, which we considered very reasonable, and numerous
talks with government officials, we felt confident to invest in Albania. Initially we wanted
to purchase land for our operations, but such an opportunity did not materialize.
Alternatively, we looked at leasing a site for a planned tank farm.

 

7. The authorities recommended Durres as an investment site and assured us that the market
conditions would soon improve (see meeting below with the Minister of Economy and the
Minister of Energy). The site was previously also used for fuel tanks by the formerly state-
owned petrol company. The port of Durres was our first choice as it not only offered the
necessary general infrastructure but also a pipeline for the unloading of ships that was
specifically built for the operation of tank farms. At the meetings, there was no alternative
investment site discussed.

8. One of the meetings was held with the Minister of Economy (Mr. Anastas Angjeli) and the
Minister of Energy (Mr. Bufi) in 1998. Present at the meeting was also Mr. Kalfas
(Technical Consultant for Claimant) and Mr. Nikolaos Mamidakis (Managing Director). In
this meeting, both Ministers encouraged us to apply for an approval to invest in tank farms
in the port of Durres and assured us that the market conditions would soon improve and that
the necessary licenses for the operation will be granted. At that time, I was not aware of
any relocation plans of the government. I think the relocation was not even in their heads at
that time. Had we known anything about the relocation plans, we would not have invested 8
million USD in a tank farm. The other sites did not offer the necessary infrastructure and an
investment did not seem viable there. At these meetings, we also discussed our plans to
establish an extensive retail-network. This included buying out existing petrol stations and
also setting up new stations. Both Ministers were eager to convince us to invest in Albania.
We applied to have our investment approved. After receiving the “go-ahead”, we signed a
lease agreement and about half a year later we began the construction of the oil tanks. |”

 

 

Had Claimant known at that time that plans existed to change the use of the port of Durres
fundamentally, it would not have invested without formal and official re-assurances that it
could go ahead. It is very possible that it would have desisted from investing in Albania
altogether. Rl

Further planning was effectuated which finally resulted in the business plan of 1998. The
fact that the plan is succinct and concentrated on major results and orientation is typical for
a family-run business where all partners are intimately involved in the evolution of an
investment project.

It was only after all these inquiries, research and the establishment of the business plan that
Claimant requested the approval for the investment in July 1998 and again in November
1998. A full technical and financial documentation was attached to the requests. When the
Albanian authorities approved the investment in January 1999 and when they negotiated
and concluded the lease contract in June 1999, they were therefore fully informed of the
project. In fact, both the business plan and the Investment Schedule were in the files of the
office that signed the lease contract even if those documents were not formally attached to
the contract. '??

The project as presented in 1998 was only the first step in Claimant’s overall plans: “In a
second step, Claimant planned to distribute the oil from the tank facilities to industrial
clients and consumers throughout Albania and build additional tank farms.” 123

Even after the request for the approval of the investment had been lodged, the local
subsidiary had been set up, the necessary approval had been received, the lease contract
had been concluded and the site had been transferred, the investment activity could not

begin. It took another six months of preparation of the site, selection of contractors for the
construction of the reservoirs, and further discussions with Albanian authorities before the
execution of the first phase of the investment and the construction of the reservoirs could
begin. 124

There is some uncertainty as to the scope and application of legal due diligence. While
Claimant asserts in general terms that local legal advice was sought, !° its witness Mr.
Kalfas, who was instrumental in the establishment of the project in Albania, stated when
asked why Mamidoil did not instruct a law firm with handling legal due diligence, “J don’t
see a reason for that. If you are technically capable to do so and when you are contacting
the right authorities, then I don’t see why you need a lawyer.”'?6

    

In any event, Claimant’s owners and senior management Messrs. Kyriakos, Nikolaos and
Aleksandros Mamidakis testified unanimously that during numerous meetings — as
underlined by Mr. Aleksandros Mamidakis’s statement that “/wJe had meetings in 1998,
1999, 2000 and even in 2010"'*’ — the high Government officials and political decision-
makers consistently endorsed the plan, made assurances as to the regulatory requirements
and encouraged Claimant to go ahead with the project. All of these representations were
made orally, without written confirmation, 128 and are therefore not in evidence beyond the
testimony of the witnesses.

The local partner responsible for the day-to-day business equally affirmed that no obstacles
existed and that the procedures were going forward normally. 7°

With respect to the relationship between the construction period and the emerging plans to
re-zone the port of Durres, Claimant has modified its initial position in two aspects. It no
longer contends that 85% of the construction work was completed in November 1999, i.e.
at a date when the Durres Port Authority had not yet sent a letter to Mamidoil Albanian
informing it that a new master-plan for Durres was under serious debate; nor does
Claimant contend that it had only been informed about the new plan for the port of Durres
in June 2000 when 85% of the construction work was completed.

Claimant confirms now that the Port Authority sent a letter of warning in November 1999
and that the letter was received and answered by the Deputy General Director of Mamidoil
Albanian. Claimant’s witness and General Director of Mamidoil Albanian, Mr.
Aleksandros Mamidakis, has stated that there was no need to take note of the letter since

the sender had no authority to emit any warnings and that he personally had no knowledge
of the letter and subsequent letters, despite that one was addressed to him, before sometime
in early 2000. Moreover, he also stated that Claimant reverted to the competent Albanian
authorities in order to receive re-assurances that the investment was not called into
question and that such assurances were given orally.'*° He further stated that the local
partner and his deputy general director, with whom he followed the day-to-day business
but who was more in charge of the details, had equally assured Claimant that it “should
proceed as plannea”.'*! As already stated, Claimant’s witness Mr. Nikolaos Mamidakis,
Claimant’s managing director, testified that he saw the letter at least around March/April
2000.'*

Claimant further asserts that one of the two major results of the negotiations that have
taken place with Respondent, with the assistance of the Greek Government after the
interruption of the construction in July 2000, has been the authorization to resume and
complete the construction work in December 2000. The authorization was given by the
Prime Minister who was at the same time the chairperson of the TACRA, the body in
charge of the approval of construction permits under the Law on Urban Planning. The
other major result was the issuance of the trading permit, which allowed Claimant to
operate the tank farm until February 2011 unless a prior order of relocation were to be
issued. Claimant considers that a prior termination would be illegal. 133

Claimant asserts that after all of the discussions with and the decisions of high-ranking
Albanian officials, it was entitled to believe in good faith that the possible re-zoning of the
port of Durres would neither affect the legality nor the reality of its investment there, and
that it could trust the stability of the lease contract.

Despite the government’s assurances that the investment in and operation of the port of
Durres were accepted, welcome and safe, Claimant did not rule out a possible relocation to
Porto Romano if financial compensation were paid. Claimant consistently communicated
its flexibility to the government, both in 2003 when the Albanian-Greek high level working
group met as well as in letters of 27 January 2003'* and 22 February 2008,'%° ie. after
Respondent’s decision to prohibit further landing by vessels in the port of Durres.

By rejecting any claim for compensation, Respondent violated the commitment it had
expressed vis-a-vis the World Bank in 2000 when a Minister had told the World Bank
mission that “the Government and the company would study this matter over the next two

to three years with a view to relocating the tank farm. The Government will also need to
identify funds to compensate the company for moving.”'*°
the master-plan by Louis Berger Inc., which at this time acted for the European
Commission, warned that the companies operating in Durres “[m]ight seek compensation
for the early termination of the lease.”'*7

Moreover, in 2010 a review of

Claimant alleges that Respondent’s decision to close the port of Durres for the discharge of
petroleum products beginning in 2009 was not based in public policy considerations at all
but had its only rationale in the settlement agreement with Petrolifera, wherein Respondent
had promised to close the ports of Durres and Shengjin from 31March 2009 at the latest.

. Claimant further alleges that when the decision was taken, the Albanian Government had
abandoned the master plan that had been accepted more than six years before but that was
not being put into effect. Respondent’s indifference towards environmental and safety
problems in ports close to residential areas is clearly documented by the facts that firstly,
the port of Shengjin was re-opened in clear contradiction to previous policy
announcements, and secondly, Respondent explicitly authorized Claimant to carry on its
activities of storage and transport to and from the tank farm by truck. The real purpose of
the decision, according to Claimant, was to favor Claimant’s Italo-Albanian competitor
Petrolifera by prohibiting the landing of ships. 188

. With respect to the environmental permit, the construction site permit, the construction
permit and the exploitation permit, Claimant generally asserts that it has continuously
requested that the local authorities direct Claimant to the requirements and assist with the
necessary documentation. In many meetings with the responsible Ministers, Claimant
alleges to have been told orally to go ahead with the investment and not to worry about
permits, which would automatically follow as a pure formality. When addressing technical
departments, the reaction was that nothing more was needed because “you already have the
governmental authorization”. 19

. Claimant relies on Professor Dobjani’s expert opinion and his statement that authorities
were not abreast of the procedural requirements or prerequisites of good governance and
were “hesitant to touch issues with foreign investors”. 140

Claimant finally submits that Respondent never alleged that either the construction or the
operation of the tank farm were illegal and that it never indicated that it would close the

tank farm as stipulated in the different laws on the environment and on urban planning. On
the contrary, Respondent showed a vivid interest in the operation by collecting millions of
tax revenue on the project over the years.

Specifically, as to the different permits, Claimant contends as follows:

The environmental permit: Claimant applied for it in May 2000 when the construction was
underway. It took Respondent several years until it reacted to the application for the first
time. Under these circumstances, the permit was considered granted, according to Article
20 of the Environmental Law of 1993 and Article 38 of the Environmental Law of 2002.

Out of precaution and since a written permit — or confirmation of the implicitly-granted
permit — had still not been issued, Claimant applied a second time under the new law. The
Ministry of Environment rejected the request by pointing to an Environmental Survey of
Durres Port according to which a “disturbing environmental problematic” prevailed in the
port.

The review, however, did not concern Claimant’s tank farm but the old, formerly State-
owned reservoirs that were, indeed, in a state of disrepair. In contrast to these tanks,
Claimant’s installation was constructed and maintained according to high international
safety standards. This is not only confirmed by international agencies such as Lloyd’s
Register of shipping and Industrial Services but also by the Albanian authorities
themselves, who confirmed that the tanks are basically clean and well maintained as well
as well built and sound. '!

During the time of operation, no incident was recorded except for damage to the pumping
pipeline from the pier to the deposit, which according to Claimant was misleadingly
characterized by counsel for Respondent as an “explosion”. The Albanian authorities
inspected the incident and the repair and stated that the problem had been eliminated and
that there “are no unaccomplished tasks”. 2

Claimant’s witness, Mr. Alexandros Mamidakis, testified that the tank farm was situated in
an enclosed area of the port, more than 400 to 500 meters away from residential buildings,
separated by a road and therefore not posing any safety risk. M8

According to Claimant, the excellent quality of the installation and the fulfilment of all
technical requirements have been consistent over time, and when the permit was finally
granted, it was based on exactly the same documentation that had been submitted with the
first request. According to Article 24 of the 1993 Environmental Law, the permit has a

retroactive effect. The fact that the authorities did not close down the tank farm as foreseen
in Article 24 establishes that the retroactive effect was triggered. MA

172. The construction site permit and the construction permit: Claimant does not allege that it
applied for a construction site permit. It alleges, however, that the request for the approval
of the investment of 3 July 1998 is at the same time an application for a construction
permit and that the inter-ministerial “approval in principle” of 6 January 1999 is at the
same time a construction permit.

 

173. In its Reply, Claimant equates the approval application to a construction-permit application
and the approval in principle to a construction permit. '*° When confronted with these
assertions during the hearing it replied:

We have said consistently that Claimant always thought it had applied for a construction permit,
and you will hear the witness Emmanuel Kalfas I think tomorrow, who will say that when he
was informed that what they had might not be sufficient, he went to the Urban Planning Office
and they told him, ‘You don't need a construction permit; you already have one’. [...] and given
the intricacies of Albanian law, I also briefly needed to review -- well, what we are saying is:
yes, we applied for a construction permit. If you look at this letter of November 1998 (CE-162),
it says the ‘proposal to [the] Government regarding the construction and operation of a tank
farm’, and it contains then more than ten pages of technical documentation. We say here today
that this was clearly not in the form required by law. But we ask the government at the end of
that letter: ‘We would highly appreciate it if you could let us have your final views on this
subject as well as on the procedure to be followed for its implementation.” And then we had this
in-principle approval. Now, this in-principle approval is not a formal construction permit as
such; it doesn't comply to the form as required, as foreseen by the law. But as our legal expert
Mr Dobjani has said in his opinion, it was this in-principle approval which was decisive,
because once this in-principle approval has been given, the rest is only a mere formality. That is
why we today say we ask you to look at the content and not at the form. '“°

 

174. In its closing statement, Claimant reiterated

- that Prof. Dobjani, Claimant’s expert on Albanian law had opined that “not even the
government knew exactly what the procedures for the building of a tank farm
were”,

- that its senior management was convinced that the request was treated as an
application,

- that “they did not know the permit was not applied for in time” and that they trusted
the local partner to comply with all the formalities, '*

- that until 2003, nobody had ever indicated that Claimant “might have a problem
with the construction permit, although the government, contrary to what
Respondent has said, knew or should have known long before”,'” and

that “the Prime Minister personally had negotiated the settlement after the
construction stop in 2000, and we know from the testimony of the expert witnesses
that the Prime Minister chairs TACRA. And we say now this is a matter of imputing
knowledge, and we say that the government at that time should have known whether
there is a construction permit or not; and if there is one, they should have alerted
Mamidoil.”'”

175. Claimant asserts with respect to the construction permit that the approval in principle and
the authorization by the Prime Minister to terminate the construction are to be considered
as the substantive basis for the formal construction permit which — seen in context — is no
more than a pure formality which does not impact on the legality of the tank farm.

176. In addition to the quoted documents, Claimant produced requests for a construction site
permit and construction permit using the Forms prescribed by Law No. 8405.'*! The forms
are undated but seem to be stamped by a notary in 2001. They are signed with the name of
Mr. Alexandros Mamidakis who personally, when confronted with the document, testified
that he had never seen the document and that the signatures were not his. 152

177. In his closing statement, counsel for Claimant asserted that “in Albania it is not unusual for
someone else to sign for someone” and that a possible explanation for the problem “would
be that for kind of normal matters, which are not of extreme importance, where you think
someone needs to see it, you simply sign in the name of the general director. But I am

speculating and I am not assessing evidence”. 153

178. Claimant finally asserts that Respondent granted the authorization for the customs
warehouse in the port of Durres without any problem and that such authorization depends
on a valid construction permit.'™4

179. The exploitation permit: Claimant alleges that it has applied for an exploitation permit, as
evidenced by contemporaneous correspondence with Respondent. The copy of the

application was simply not found in the files. Claimant further alleges that, despite
numerous complaints about the absence of any response, the Albanian authorities remained
completely passive and irresponsive. Since they did not in any way interfere with the
operation of the tank farm, Claimant was entitled to believe the Ministers’ assurances that
the permit was no more than a formality and would in no way hinder the exploitation of the
tank farm as a legal matter, as the permit was implied. In addition, and in any event, the
trading permit encompassed the exploitation permit. 155

With respect to other events and circumstances, which it alleges encumbered its investment
and operation, Claimant accentuates certain aspects of facts that are basically undisputed.

Concerning reserve requirements, Claimant does not complain about the gradual increases
that were in line with European standards but rather about the dramatic decrease from 3000
to 300 cubic meters, which it says created unfair market conditions because it allowed
small competitors without structured reservoirs to flood the market, particularly as they did
not have to fear any governmental control. 156

With respect to the quality of diesel that could be marketed in Albania, Claimant alleges
that Respondent reduced the requirement in favour of a local refinery that was up for
privatization. The international operators had no access to these products and were at the
same time not allowed to import the lower quality diesel. Claimant argues that the
Constitutional Court invalidated this “apparent and severe market distortion” in 2009. 7

Claimant further argues that the intention of the changes of reserve requirements and
diesel-quality standards had the purpose “to force importers out of the market’. The
measures were focused on the companies operating in Durres.'**

Concerning fuel smuggling and adulteration, Claimant’s focus is less on the fact that
Albania was notorious for such behavior but rather that Respondent did nothing to combat
it, despite many complaints and concrete proposals by Claimant and other companies to
reverse the trend and despite that mechanisms, channels and methods of smuggling were
common knowledge. Instead of improving, the situation worsened from 2003 on because
Respondent turned “a blind eye on a variety of illegal activities and practices”, leaving
Claimant unprotected. 159

With respect to the alleged “excessive and completely arbitrary tax claims”,!© Claimant

submits that Respondent has imposed excise taxes and VAT on quantities as shown on the

bill of lading and not on the actual quantities as they left the customs warehouse. Claimant

contends that, due to evaporation and other losses during transport and unloading, the

difference between the two quantities is considerable. According to Claimant, it

corresponds with international practice and an EU Directive to use the outturn quantity for

calculating the taxes. By disrespecting the international practice and European law, the

customs authorities have collected “much higher taxes than it was obliged to”.

+ 161

Claimant also brought a claim of unjust enrichment for reimbursement of the overpaid
taxes and “[d]espite the clear legal situation, the Custom Office asked the District Court to
reject Mamidoil Albanian’s claim for lack of jurisdiction arguing that they should have
first initiated an administrative request before the Customs Office according to Art.249 of
the Customs Code”.'® The district court found in favour of Claimant. The decision was
overturned by the Supreme Court and “unforeseeably deviated from established practice”,

and the latter decision was not quashed by the Constitutional Court. Claimant alleges that

both courts’ conduct amounts to a denial of justice since a new judicial review before the

Customs Authority is time barred and Claimant is deprived of judicial remedies. '® Since

2009, the matter has been pending before the European Court of Human Rights.

164

In its Memorial, Claimant has also alleged that “[t]hroughout the years of operation,

Claimant was exposed to arbitrary taxation. Even where Claimant obtained favorable

court decisions

‘or reimbursement, Respondent refused to pay. This was a common

practice in Albania”.'© Claimant has not substantiated or evidenced these allegations and
has not pursued them in its Reply.

In summary, Claimant asserts that “[d]ue to the legal uncertainty that came with the

extensive fuel smuggling, the tax evasion by competitors, the conditional Trading License

and Respondent’s unpredictable behaviour, Claimant adjusted its original business plan.

The plan to set up a network of company owned and company operated petrol

stations (COCOs) was abandoned and a more cautious, short term approach was adopted.

As a consequence, the whole operation was downsized”. ‘66 Claimant’s witness Alexandros

Mamidakis adds that Claimant took “a more cautious approach” in Albania and decided to

suspend the COCO concept “due to the suddenly adopted plans by the Albanian

4.2.2 Respondent’s position

189. Respondent alleges that Claimant invested in Albania in 1998 in the import, storage,
transport, wholesale and retail sale of petroleum products “in the aftermath of Albania’s
social, economic and financial breakdown and in the midst of the chaos it had brought” by
revisiting an older plan dating from 1995.'° Claimant sought to be operating in Albania
very early, even before normal market conditions were in place, in order to secure a
competitive advantage of market penetration and notoriety.

190. Instead to plan the investment, it decided in a span of some days:

to fast-track its establishment in the market with complete disregard for the existing laws and
regulations at the time, so as to take advantage of the chaos from which the country was
emerging (in an industry which would, by its public order nature, inevitably and imminently be
subject to further regulation), and place the Republic of Albania and its future competitors
before a fait accompli.

LJ
On 31 March 1998, the Jet Oil Group’s Northern Greece Directorate reverted to the Board of
Directors of Claimant with a mere 3-page letter, which Claimant has elevated, for the purposes
of this arbitration, to a “Business Plan.” The Northern Greece Directorate of the Jet Oil Group
sets forth in this “three pager” its assessment of Claimant's entry into Albania’s petroleum
market through the development of wholesale activities, a network of petrol stations and
associated carwash activities. Notably, it anticipated that within five years Claimant would be

 

able to secure a stable 16%-18% market share within a five year period, resulting in a profit of
approximately USD 4 million per year.

The so-called ‘Business Plan’ did not address in any way, be it directly or indirectly, the
ry to conduct the envisaged

 

governmental approvals, authorizations or permits that were nec
operations pursuant to Albanian law, let alone the specific procedures, conditions or
timeframe required to obtain the same. The “Business Plan” ignored the forthcoming inevitable
regulations in this public order sector, in a country which it knew to be in “a state of
transition,” and similarly ignored other important matters relevant to the envisaged activity,
such as the existing black market, taxation issues, alternative location options (be it Port of
Duress or one of the other possible locations it had identified earlier).'°

191. Respondent contends that it was obvious for any observer of the Albanian economic and
political development that the country would try to integrate itself into an ecologically-
oriented market economy, which necessitated profound regulatory changes and an
adaptation of its infrastructure.

According to Respondent, Claimant failed not only to take necessary future changes into
consideration but did not even bother to understand the legal requirements that were in
force during the preparation and execution of its construction.

Instead, Respondent argues that Claimant relied on vague declarations of support as well as
informal and oral assurances that are not documented in evidence, not just as a proof of a
general non-objection to the investment, but as a firm legal basis for a multi-million-dollar
construction of a tank farm in a densely populated port where some old and run-down
petroleum reservoirs were rotting.

Respondent further asserts that Claimant did not ask itself whether the communist-style use
and administration of the most important port of the country, Durres, with its apparent
deficiencies and pollution hazards would continue.

Respondent argues that the three page “business plan” cannot be considered the result of
any due diligence in general and legal due diligence in particular. Despite its utter lack of
completeness, no local legal advice was sought to learn about the regulatory requirements,
authorizations and permits, which must precede any construction and exploitation of
reservoirs for petroleum products, which is apparently an ecologically-sensitive installation
and activity.

Respondent alleges in particular that Claimant should have been aware that Albania had
received support and assistance from international development agencies such as the World
Bank (IDA) and European institutions for the modernization of its infrastructure including
road and maritime transport. The agreement with IDA, which explicitly mentioned the port
of Durres as its central target, was published in the Official Gazette!” and accessible to
any interested person and certainly any trained lawyer.

Even if Claimant had carelessly not endeavored to learn about these upcoming
developments that would have an impact on the characteristics of the port of Durres,
Claimant was definitely informed about these perspectives and plans by the letter sent by
the Durres Sea Port Authority dated 17 November 1999. The letter summarized and
repeated a previous verbal notification. Besides requesting the suspension of construction
works, the letter informed Claimant that a review was underway to establish a new master
plan for the port.

The Port Authority is part of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport and thereby part
of the governmental structure.'”! Several other warning letters followed, which reiterated

that the “perspective is not safe?!” that Claimant should suspend the construction and that

the “financial consequences” of any decision taken against these requests would have to be
: 173
borne by Claimant.

2°

Respondent has noted that two of the owners and members of senior management of
Claimant have admitted to have been informed about the letter before March /April 2000,
thus belying the initial allegation that the decision to re-zone Durres “came out of the blue”
and was not communicated to Claimant before June 2000 when the master plan and the
new orientation of the port were formally adopted.

(0. Respondent also has expressed its doubts that correspondence of such vital importance and
partly addressed to one of the co-owners of Claimant, who was at the same time general
director for Mamidoil Albanian and who followed “with our local partners part of the day-
to-day business”,'* should have gone unnoticed. It further asserts that in any event
Claimant cannot hide behind its own passivity and lack of organization. The letter must be
considered received when it reached the local office even if its individual managers
remained ignorant of it or claim that they may have neglected it because it came from a
governmental level under the Ministers. 175

The letter was received before any major construction costs on the tank farm had been
incurred.

2. While the warning letters had no immediate legal consequences, they put Claimant clearly
on notice about what would be the future orientation of the port of Durres. Importantly,
the letter by the Ministries of Public Economy and of Transport dated 21 July 2000'7° also
ordered the interruption of further investment in the port and referred to the Decision of the
Council of Ministries of 13 June 2000!” by which the new master plan for Durres that
foresaw the dislocation of all petroleum tanks had been accepted.

3. Respondent asserts that its subsequent decision to authorize the completion of construction
works in the port and the granting of a temporary trading license had come about after a
political intervention by the Greek government, Greece being a politically-important
neighbor and economically the most important trading partner of Albania, and had been the
result of political negotiations.'” It was thus a “politically-driven solution” and taken only
“to accommodate the Greek Government’ which had exerted “substantial political and

diplomatic pressure”. 9

204. The compromise was negotiated and concluded “upon the express understanding that it

was Mamidoil Albanian’s own business decision to continue its operations on this
provisional basis in the Port of Durres and that it eventually would have to relocate its
business in view of the adopted Land Use Plan.”'*°

205. Respondent asserts that it authorized the completion of the construction and granted the

temporary trading license in order to allow Claimant to develop its business and prepare
for the relocation for which it was granted a priority site in Porto Romano. It scrupulously
respected the decision and interfered in no way with Claimant’s business. '*!

206. According to Respondent, it was exclusively Claimant’s “reckless business decision’ that

finally led to the suspension and then termination of the development of COCOs, which
“single-handedly killed any possibility of developing a financially viable business” .'?
Claimant also made the business decision not to apply for a new trading license when the
temporary one expired in 2011. This can be compared to the experience of another Greek
company, “Global”, which applied for and received the license without difficulty. In sum,
Claimant was confronted with the negative consequences of its wrong decisions and

wanted to pull out of the country with a maximum of compensation. 183

207. During negotiations and efforts to find a politically-acceptable way out of the

consequences of Claimant’s disregard of the imminent reforms in the port, the issue of
Claimant’s compliance or non-compliance with regulatory requirements and permits was
not in any way addressed. The focus of the discussions was on other issues. Respondent
insists that it did not know then or when the question of compensation for moving was
discussed with the World Bank mission in July 2000'* that some of the crucial permits
were not applied for, let alone granted. 185

208. In any event, neither the approval in principle nor the lease agreement nor the trading

license did or could substitute the necessary permits and legalize the illegalities linked to
their absence. Moreover, there was no waiver of these requirements, which exist to protect
the public interest. '*°

209. Respondent asserts that it abstained from implementing the Council of Ministers’ Decision

No. 294 of 13 June 2000 approving the new Land Use Plan for Durres before the

infrastructure in Porto Romano was built. By following this consistent line of policy, it had
neither abandoned the master plan and the resulting plan of relocation from Durres, nor had
it waived its right to implement it for the sake of public interest when all the conditions
were met.'*” In fact, it is still pursuing the plan, which has been integrated into a national
transport plan established together with the European Union'** and supported by the World
Bank.'®

According to Respondent, it is public knowledge that the construction of the infrastructure
in Porto Romano was tendered in 2003, that construction started in 2004 and that the new
port for the landing of petroleum products by ship was opened in July 2009. 190

It was inevitable that once these infrastructures existed the Government would close the
port of Durres to tankers. That was announced by letter of 6 October 2006 addressed to all
companies operating in Durres!! and implemented by the Council of Ministers’ Decision
No. 486 dated 25 July 2007.'” The decision granted a delay of 18 months, which was
slightly extended to be effective as of 1 July 2009. Since that time, and in spite of requests
by the Greek operators in Durres, no more ships carrying petroleum products are allowed
into the port of Durres.

Respondent insists that the delay was granted to take into account the completion of the
construction work in Porto Romano, on the one hand to accommodate competitors by
keeping the port open as long as possible, and on the other hand by allowing them to
organize the relocation.

As far as the Greek companies including Claimant are concerned, the decision was as
conservative as possible. It firstly granted a period of 18 months for adaptation, and
secondly, rather than order relocation, it restricted the prohibition on the landing of ships,
thereby allowing the storage of petroleum products and the transport by road to and from
the reservoirs beyond 2009. This was meant to mitigate the effects for all companies
operating tank farms in Durres. 198

Respondent further insists that Claimant had accepted to relocate and that Respondent
maintained a priority site in Porto Romano for Claimant. At the same time, Claimant was
not entitled to ask for compensation since it had executed its investment in bad faith,
rushing into Durres and investing the bulk of money into the tank farm without bothering

to acquire the basic permits when it already knew that the relocation would be

necessary.

The ban of petroleum tankers from Durres was an important step in the implementation of
the master plan, which in turn responded to vital safety, environmental and public policy
concerns. Another important aspect was that the plan had already partly been respected and
accounted for when dealing with other companies that wanted to import fuel to Albania
and that were not allowed to operate from the port of Durres, in anticipation of its
imminent closure. These newcomer companies were entitled to rely on the government’s
consistent conduct and on the implementation of the master plan in accordance with its
international obligations.

Respondent explained:
Did we comply with this obligation of good faith duty to mitigate? We did, by granting that

temporary permit, and by respecting it. In 2007 it's true that a new Council of Ministers’
decision was i:

 

sued. Why? Because we have to comply with international law. We cannot take a

 

measure to say,

other ports, and keep indefinitely the port of Durres open.”'”* The competitors rightly said: You
196

You cannot go into the port of Durres”, direct all the newcomers and others to

cannot ban us to go there, and at the same time allow others to stay there forever.

The Decision to ban ships from Durres therefore did “nothing more than to partly
implement the long-standing and well-known Council of Ministers Decision No. 251 of 20
April 2001 and Decision No. 21 of the Territorial Regulatory Council of 19 October 2001
which foresaw in the relocation of the activities of processing and the storage of oil in
Porto Romano”.'*’ It was a decision that “served the overriding interests of the public at
large, was entirely foreseeable” and is not identical in scope with the settlement agreement
with Petrolifera.'°*

With respect to the environmental permit, the construction site permit, the construction
permit and the exploitation permit, Respondent asserts that none of them has been applied
for with the competent authorities, in a timely manner, in the legally prescribed form and
accompanied by the appropriate documentation. 199

Respondent also maintains that it cannot be held against it that for some time it was not
aware that Claimant was proceeding without the required permits. When it found out in

early 2003, Respondent put Claimant on notice and started to press it to submit the
necessary documentation for a possible regularization of the situation. This is evidenced by
the minutes of the meeting of the working committee of 20 March 2003 and by
correspondence between the Parties. Respondent explains that it was willing to consider
regularization in order to save Claimant’s investment.”

As to the different permits in detail, Respondent contends as follows:

The environmental permit: Respondent asserts that Claimant has not followed the clear
provisions of either Law on Environmental Protection when it applied for a permit on 10
May 2000, i.e. months after the start of its construction, with the Regional Environmental
Agency.

It further asserts that the application as evidenced did not contain the supporting
documentation that the law requires.

Respondent asserts that contrary to Articles 18 and 19 of the 1993 Law on Environmental
Protection, which stipulate that the application for a permit concerning toxic substances
must be made to the Council of Ministers before the activity starts, Claimant made the
application after the start of the construction of the tank farm and to the Regional
Environmental Agency and not to the Council of Ministers.

Respondent also contends that Articles 34 ss. of the 2002 Law on Environmental
Protection was not complied with. That provision requires that the application be made
before the beginning of an activity that is “likely to affect the environment” (Article 34),
that necessary supporting documentation be submitted, and that the proper recipient be the
Minister of the Environment.

Respondent further alleges that, contrary to Claimant’s allegations, it reacted to the
application in a timely fashion. Respondent refers to an exchange of letters where Claimant
admits in a letter dated 15 February 2001 to have understood that the “granting of
Environmental License was not approved” ."!

Moreover, a series of inspections were undertaken. An inspection conducted from 11 to 22
March 2002 found that “the new facilities are basically sound and well built” but detected
18 deficiencies, including the risk of an explosion presenting “a high risk situation to these
residents”. The report recommended the relocation of the site to a less-populated area.?”

A further study was carried out by the Durres Port Authority, which also detected
environmental problems including the “elimination of secondary pollutions of fuel

deposits, elimination of fuel leaks, internal drainage with fuel tankers, processing the
ballasts of the fuel remaining in the discharge pipeline” among others.?°

The risk of an explosion materialized in early 2003 with the “explosion of a junction of the
discharge line in the Mamidoil S.A. entity”. Even if this incident was quickly addressed and
had no major consequences, it demonstrated, together with the studies, that it was urgent to
close the port of Durres for landing and handling petroleum products.

When Respondent finally granted the temporary environmental permit on 31 May 2007, it
was “issued for a temporary term, till the moment of the displacement of tanks in the final
7204 and was meant to regularize Claimant’s position until its move to Porto
Romano. The permit did not cure the deficiencies of procedure and the related illegality of
Claimant’s activity arising from the non-respect of both laws on environmental
protection?” :

location

The construction site permit and the construction permit: Respondent asserts that Claimant
never even pretended to have applied for a construction site permit and that the documents
it considered to be applications for a construction permit are seriously flawed.

Both the Laws on Urban Planning of 1991 and of 1998 provide that a written application,
using specific forms which are attached to the laws, is mandatory for each person wanting
to construct in Albania. Both laws provide that construction site permits and construction
permits on surfaces bigger than 0.5 hectares must be approved by the TACRA, which is
chaired by the Prime Minister. Both laws equally provide that the applications must be
filed, together with the legally-specified documentation, before the beginning of any
construction activity and that the granting of the construction permit is dependent on the
previous granting of the construction site permit.

Since the construction started at the beginning of 2000, the 1998 Law was applicable.

Respondent asserts that the requests in 1998 for approval of the investment and the
conclusion of a lease contract do not under any circumstances fulfill the criteria of a valid
request for a construction permit under the law.

Respondent relies on the unequivocal statements of both Claimant’s and Respondent’s
legal experts. While Prof. Dobjani’s written analysis seems ambiguous, according to
Respondent the ambiguity was lifted by his oral testimony, which unambiguously stated
that the request for approval of the investment “is not an application formally” °° Both

experts on Albanian law have confirmed that the different applications, requests and
correspondence do not qualify as requests in the sense of the law.

Respondent submits the following further arguments for this opinion: Firstly, when the
request was formulated in 1998, no lease contract was yet in place and no site was
identified. A valid request for a construction site permit and a construction permit must
contain, as a prerequisite, the identification of a site. Secondly, the requests relied on by
Claimant were addressed to the Minister of Economy and Privatization and not to the
competent authority, the TACRA. Thirdly, the supporting documentation was at least
incomplete, if not totally absent. Fourthly, none of the forms, which are required by and
attached to both laws, were used.?°7

Respondent has analyzed the two forms that were submitted by Claimant as exhibits to its
Reply.7° It submits that although the forms are undated, it is evident from a notarial stamp
at the margin that they date from 31 August 2001, ie. many months after the completion of
the construction. It further notes that one of the forms refers to an exploitation permit and
not a construction permit, that both forms are largely incomplete, that nothing indicates
that any documents were attached, and that no evidence suggests that they were filed with
the competent authorities. According to Respondent, since not even the signature is
truthful, the forms must be disregarded.?”

Respondent further contends that the two requests for the permits as well as the permits
themselves are absent. Neither the inter-ministerial approvals in principle nor the lease
contract qualify as anything approaching a construction site permit or a construction
permit. Both legal experts unequivocally confirm this.

Respondent argues that it is wrong to assume that the Parties had reached an understanding
that the application and the permits had been established in substance if not in form.
Firstly, there are no representations to this effect by Government officials in evidence.
Secondly, when Respondent allowed the completion of the construction in 2000, it was not
aware of the lack of the permits and the illegality of the construction. Thirdly, the fact that

Respondent decided not to demolish the construction once it learned that the permits did
2

not exist was based on a “lenient good faith stance”, 10 Which also led it to grant Claimant
the possibility to fructify its investment and minimize the losses caused by its illegal
conduct. Fourthly, the fact that Claimant has received a customs warehouse certificate
cannot be interpreted as Respondent’s tacit recognition of the existence of the construction
permit because the authorization does not require that such permit be submitted.

Respondent asserts that according to both Laws on Urban Planning, Claimant’s
constructions were illegal and could not be legalized. Respondent’s conduct cannot be
interpreted as a waiver to sanction the illegality. The proposals to regularize the situation
were motivated, again, by the desire to mitigate Claimant’s damages and pave the way for
a fresh start.7!!

The exploitation permit: Respondent asserts that Claimant did not apply for an exploitation
permit to evaluate the design, implementation and testing of constructions as to their urban
planning, technical and economic conditions.”

Respondent alleges that even if it is accepted arguendo from secondary evidence that an
application was made, the same evidence proves that it was made after the start of the tank
farm’s operation and therefore was untimely.

Respondent alleges further that the documentation was certainly not submitted and in any
event would have been difficult to obtain since it includes a testing document that was not
obtained because of multiple, serious shortcomings detected during operation.

From 2003 onwards, Respondent kept reminding Claimant on different occasions that the
permit was lacking and urged it to regularize the situation by submitting a formal
application and the appropriate documentation. When Claimant finally filed an application
in May 2003, it was incomplete. Claimant failed to complete it despite requests to do so.

Consequently, no exploitation permit was ever granted, and Claimant operated the tank
farm illegally. This is all the more so, according to Respondent, since the temporary
trading permit does not substitute for the exploitation permit.7!

In sum, Respondent asserts that Claimant operated over the years without at least three
important permits, which are all crucial for economic, social, urban planning and
environmental policies. Respondent made efforts to help Claimant to regularize the
situation to allow it to conduct its business legally, but despite these initiatives, Claimant
never made valid and documented applications. Respondent therefore maintains that
Claimant has conducted its business illegally from the beginning until the end of the use of
the tank farms.?!

With respect to other events and circumstances that were identified by Claimant as factual
bases for violations of international law, Respondent contends as follows.

With respect to the reserve requirements, Respondent asserts that the measure to reduce the
security reserve from 3000 cubic meters to 300 cubic meters was intended to put into
practice the overall goal of the Government to enhance market competition. It was a
contribution to market liberalization and had a welcome effect in this sense, ensuring a
better supply of consumers.

According to Respondent, the measure was not aimed at Claimant but at market
competition in general.

Had Claimant wished to make sure that such a legitimate public policy was not pursued, it
could have negotiated to protect itself with specific assurances and stabilization clauses.7!°

On the other hand, Respondent argues that the fact that it did not force Claimant to relocate
from Durres and that it allowed Claimant to continue to operate the reservoirs means that
Claimant could have profited from its storage capacity and maintained the legal security
reserve when applying for a new trading permit in 2011. It could even have rented the
reservoirs out to other wholesalers exposed to the reserve requirements.

Respondent also notes that the reserve requirement did not prevent Claimant from applying
successfully for such new trading license.?'°

With respect to the measures changing the quality requirements for diesel, Respondent
submits that it was only in force for six months. Respondent disagrees with Claimant that
such a short-lived measure purportedly relating only to one quality of diesel could have
had an impact on Claimant’s business, diverted clients to competitors, and generally
seriously impaired its business.

Respondent further underlines that the Constitutional Court did not invalidate the measure
because it was discriminatory but rather because a constitutionally incompetent body took
the measure.”!”

With respect to fuel smuggling and adulteration, Respondent does not deny that smuggling
was a problem. However, “[w]hen Claimant came in, there was already smuggling. Every
country has smuggling. Albania was arising from chaos; this was one of the problems” 2'®
However, smuggling was apparently not the reason for Claimant’s suspension of the
creation of COCOs in 2001 because Claimant only started to complain about smuggling in

2003. Furthermore, the smuggling did not prevent Claimant from increasing its investment
in 2006 when it acquired the minority shares in Mamidoil Albanian for a high price.

Respondent also claims that it made very serious efforts to combat smuggling:

- by inviting the European Commission to deploy a Customs Assistance Mission,
which helped to restore control and develop a viable customs service,

- by entering into a bilateral “Agreement on Deployment and Naval Assistance in the
Customs Sector” with Italy, and

- by creating a nation-wide customs operation with UNCTAD to implement an
automated customs service which allowed — according to UNCTAD — for risk
management, anti-corruption measures, strong audit and monitoring functions and
established route control tools.

By a combination of these instruments, Albania argues that it has largely fulfilled its due
diligence obligations under international law and was praised by the European Union “as
the leading country in the region for its anti-smuggling activity and intelligence
development’?

With respect to the allegedly excessive tax claim, Respondent asserts firstly that the claim
is totally unsubstantiated because no documents are submitted to evidence the excise tax
and VAT calculations, to demonstrate the exact basis of calculation, to evidence the
amount of taxes allegedly imposed and allegedly paid, and to evidence the amount that was
allegedly overpaid.

Respondent alleges further that Claimant’s assertion that the Albanian tax calculation did
not correspond to international standards and contradicted a Directive of the European
Union is irrelevant for the dispute because Albania is not member of the EU and “has
broad sovereign discretion to levy taxes”.”*° In fact, the EU Customs Assistance Mission to
‘can legally use six different
methods to calculate the value of goods for custom purposes”?! It might have been a
policy reform target to calculate volume based on shore outturn quantities rather than bills
of lading, but such a reform target would not invalidate the law in force.

Albania confirmed in 2005 that the customs authorities

Respondent finally submits that the Supreme Court’s decision and the Constitutional
Court’s decision in the context of Claimant’s claim for the reimbursement of overpaid

taxes are consistent with national law. Moreover, despite these decisions, Claimant
resorted to other domestic remedies to have its claims adjudicated.”

5. JURISDICTION

5.1 The Relevant Instruments

261.

In its Request, Claimant has based its claim on the ICSID Convention and on the BIT.

262.

Nv

Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides the requirements for ICSID’s jurisdiction:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an
investment between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a
Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting
State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the
parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.

  

263. Article 10 of the BIT sets forth the requirements for a dispute between an investor and a
Contracting Party to be brought to arbitration:??

(1) Any dispute between either Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting
Party concerning investments or the expropriation or nationalization of an investment shall,
as far as possible, be settled by the disputing parties in an amicable way.

2

If such dispute cannot be settled within six months from the date either party requested
amicable settlement, the investor or the Contracting Party concerned may submit the
dispute either to the competent court of the Contracting Party, or to an international
arbitration tribunal. [...]

3) Ll

4

In case both members have become members of the Convention of 18 March 1965 on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of the Other States,
disputes between either Contracting Party and the investor of the other Contracting Party
under the first paragraph of this Article shall be submitted for settlement by conciliation or
arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.

264. It is established and undisputed between the Parties, as regards the ICSID Convention and
the BIT, that:

(i) Albania and Greece are Parties to the ICSID Convention, which is applicable
between either of them and an investor of the other State;

(ii) The Greece-Albania BIT was in force when the investment was made and therefore
applies to the present dispute;

3 CEI.

51

(iii) Claimant is a national of Greece and meets the requirements to be a protected
investor under the ICSID Convention and the BIT;

(iv) The dispute is of a legal nature; and

(v) The Parties have not reached an amicable settlement.

265. In its Memorial, Claimant has also asserted that “Respondent’s consent to ICSID
arbitration of the dispute at hand is also found in the Energy Charter Treaty”.?* Claimant
thus refers to the ECT as an additional ground on the basis of which it may bring this
arbitration, based on Respondent’s consent expressed at Article 26 of the ECT.

266. Article 26 of the ECT provides for the possibility of ICSID arbitration:

(1) Disputes between a Contracting State and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to
an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an
obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, settled amicably.

2) Ll
(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each contracting Party hereby gives its

unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation
in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

 

(4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for resolution under subparagraph
2(c)the Investor shall further provide its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to:

 

(a)(i) the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes [...] if the Contracting
Party of the Investor and the contracting Party to the dispute are both parties to the ICSID
Convention [...]

(5) The consent given in paragraph (3) together with the written consent of the Investor given
pursuant to ragraph (4) shall be d to satisfy the i for: (i) written
comment of the parties to a dispute for purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention and for
purposes of the Additional Facility Rules; [...]

267. Claimant concedes that the Request does not “explicitly mention the ECT’ but considers
this fact “irrelevant”.??> By arguing that it does not rely on the ECT to “add additional
claims” or “change the scope of claims submitted in the Request for Arbitration”, Claimant
further admits that, when it brought this arbitration, it did not rely on the ECT as a basis for
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, but that such reliance was sought only at the time it submitted
its Memorial.

268. In order to circumvent the difficulty of relying on an instrument which was not invoked at
the time the arbitration was started, Claimant has alleged that the ECT is “applicable” to

24 Cl. Mem., para. 199.
5 Cl. Mem., para. 201.

52

the present dispute “as substantive law”.?° In particular, Claimant argues that, in the

absence of a choice of law in the BIT, Article 42 of the ICSID Convention mandates that
the Tribunal apply the law of the host State and such rules of international law as may be
applicable. According to Claimant, “the rules of international law applicable to this
dispute are the BIT and the ECT. The BIT is applicable directly between Respondent and
Claimant. [...] The ECT is applicable by virtue of Art. 42 of the ICSID Convention and the
BIT.” Claimant further argues that the ECT “is part of the applicable law as the BIT
directly incorporates ins by reference to Article 11 of the BIT which provides that “[i]f
the provisions of law of either Contracting party or obligations under international law
existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to
the present Agreement contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling
investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable
than is provided for by the present Agreement, such regulation shall, to the extent that it is
more favourable, prevail over the present Agreement”.

269. In its Counter-Memorial, Respondent observed that the Request is silent on the ECT and
that it was only in its Memorial that Claimant “for the very first time raised allegations of
breaches of the EcT’? Following that, however, Respondent did not object to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis of the ECT; rather, it systematically referred to and
refuted the substance of Claimant’s allegations that Respondent breached the ECT.

270. During the hearing, the Tribunal raised this question and sought clarification from the
Parties about the difference between ‘applicable law’ and ‘basis for jurisdiction’, in view
of the impact, if any, on its jurisdiction, of Claimant’s choice to initiate the arbitration on
the basis of the BIT only and to then rely on the ECT as a further ground for the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction as the “applicable law”.?*°

271. The Tribunal notes that this question has some significance, given that the ECT contains
certain standards of protection which are absent from the BIT, such as the standard of fair
and equitable treatment, the standard of unreasonable and discriminatory measures, and the
standard of most constant protection and security.

272. In response, Claimant’s counsel, recognizing that its argument was “perhaps a_ bit
novel’,”*! noted that Respondent had not contested the application of the ECT and that
there was at least a subsequent agreement between the Parties to apply that Treaty in this

26 Cl. Mem., paras. 199, 201, 209-211.

275.

arbitration.” It further argued that nothing in the ICSID Convention prevented Claimant

from subsequently basing its claim on an additional treaty. Finally, relying on an
interpretation of Article 11 of the BIT, which it recognized is not a most-favored-nation
clause, counsel for Claimant argued that the ECT shall apply because it has “better
provisions” and because Article 11 of the BIT is “a very wide clause [which] legitimately
can apply also to procedural matters, because [...] procedural regulations — such, for
example, as the definition of applicable law in 26(8) of the ECT — form part of the
treatment, at least would accord investors a more favourable treatment or may accord
them a more favourable treatment than another treaty”?

In turn, counsel for Respondent indicated seeing “that there is an estoppel argument also
on jurisdiction that is made in regards to the scope of the application of the ECT’,
emphasizing that it had “not objected to the fact that by way of the MFN clause or other
clause, the substantive provisions of the ECT may be applicable. However, [it] never
admitted that for admissibility and jurisdictional purposes, the ECT provisions apply” 25
In the alternative, it argued that assuming the Tribunal finds “that the provisions of the
ECT apply also to jurisdiction and the question of admissibility, our second argument on
illegality based on customary international law would still appl) y” 236

The question before the Tribunal is whether, to the extent the arbitration had not been
brought on the basis of the ECT, Claimant could rely on that Treaty as the international
instrument providing for Respondent’s consent to arbitration and the standards of
protection against which the conduct of Respondent would be assessed.

The Tribunal notes that the applicability of a rule as a matter of substance is distinct from
the issue of whether an international treaty can, in a given case, be the basis for a claim and
establish a respondent State’s consent to arbitration.”*” In this respect, the Tribunal notes
that Claimant initiated its claims on the basis of the BIT, not the ECT. Nor did Claimant
ever amend its Request to refer to the ECT as a basis for its claim; to the contrary,
Claimant insisted that it did not rely on the ECT to “add additional claims” or “change the
scope of claims submitted in the Request for Arbitration’, although the Request generally
relied on “Respondent’s breach of its obligations under the BIT” rather than refer to
alleged breaches in relation to specific provisions of the Bir.?**

280.

Further, the Tribunal is not convinced that an investor can import the standards of
protection of a different treaty (here, the ECT) by simply referring to that treaty as the ‘law
applicable’ to the merits under another treaty (here, the BIT). The notion of applicable law
would, in such case, operate as a most-favoured-nation clause with regard to both
jurisdiction and merits, which it is not.

Having said that, the Tribunal is mindful that, although it objected to Claimant’s reliance
on the ECT, Respondent did not object on the basis of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction per se;
rather, it adopted a defense of its conduct on the merits in reference to the ECT standards,
contesting that the provisions of the ECT had been breached by such conduct. When asked
about this issue by the Tribunal at the hearing, Respondent indicated that it had “not
objected to the fact that by way of the MFN clause or other clause, the substantive
provisions of the ECT may be applicable” and that it “read the Article 11] clause as not
meaning anything other than the substantive laws”.?*? In other words, Respondent was not
objecting to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear the Claimant’s claims on the basis of the
ECT. Respondent did, however, make clear that it objected to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
under the ECT on the basis that Claimant’s investment had been made illegally and
therefore could not benefit from the protection of the ECT, an objection that was also
raised in relation to the BIT.

With the above in mind, to the extent the Parties both took positions as to the propriety of
the Respondent’s conduct under the ECT, for this reason alone the Tribunal will consider
the ECT when addressing the existence and legality of an investment under each of the BIT
and the ECT and Respondent’s compliance with both the BIT and the ECT.

5.2. The Investment of Claimant

5.2.1 Claimant’s position

Claimant asserts that it has made an investment in Albania by constructing a tank farm in
the port of Durres including the construction of access infrastructure and by its operation.

Claimant contends that it employed its own funds to build the tank farm, provided
management at its own costs and created Mamidoil Albanian as an operating vehicle. Once
Mamidoil Albanian was incorporated, Claimant transferred the assets that it had financed
against a controlling majority of shares to it and invested further in its stock by acquiring
the minority shares against cash in 2006.74

2H Tr, day 5, page 270.
*° Cl. Mem., para. 183; Cl. Rep., para. 207.

55

281.

243 Re

There is some uncertainty about the nature of the lease contract, which was concluded
between the Ministry of Public Economy and Mamidoil Albanian. Claimant insists that the
“investments encompass also the main assets of Mamidoil Albanian — the Lease Contract
concluded with Respondent and the tank farm?! but later specified, “[w]e do not say that
the leasing contract as such has been breached. What we say is that the investment which
is the company which operates the tank farm on the leased property has been strangled off
and indirectly expropriated’ 7242

5.2.2. Respondent’s position

282. Respondent does not contest that Claimant invested in the tank farm (Respondent claims
nearly the opposite, namely that Claimant invested too much too quickly), that it owns the
shares in Mamidoil Albanian legally and that the lease contract between Mamidoil
Albanian and Respondent was valid.*3

283. When appraising the three components — the shareholding, the lease contract concluded by
Mamidoil Albanian, and the tank farm held by Mamidoil Albanian — Respondent
concludes:

Indeed, it is by Claimant’s own admission that the tank farm formed the very basis for
entering into the Lease Agreement and the setting up of a local investment company (i.e.
Claimant’s shareholding in Mamidoil Albanian). It is therefore undeniable that the tank
farm constitutes the very core of Claimant’s purported investment and that, as a result, the
whole of the shares in Mamidoil Albanian, the Lease Agreement and the tank farm must be
regarded as a single investment, by virtue of the principle of “unity of investment.“

284. Respondent alleges, however, that the lease contract “in and of itself’? does not qualify as
an investment because it lacks the “element of contribution and risk, and moreover did not

make a contribution to the host State’s economy”.2**

5.2.3 The Determination of the Tribunal

285. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the construction of the tank farm, the setting-up
of the Albanian subsidiary that was first controlled and later wholly owned by Claimant,
the conclusion of the lease contract by the subsidiary, and the operation of the tank farm by
the subsidiary are to be considered as a unity.

The Parties agree that Claimant committed its own resources to the project in the long-term
perspective of a commercial return and that Claimant assumed a commercial risk. They
further agree that the import, transport and distribution of petroleum products were and are
of importance for the development of the Albanian economy.

Taken together, these various elements constitute an investment within the meaning of
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, Article 1 of the BIT and Article 1(6) of the ECT,
which both Parties agree to.

The Tribunal does not have to decide whether one of the items, such as the lease contract,
looked at in isolation qualifies as an investment. It is a part of a unity that the Tribunal
must appraise in its totality. In doing so, the Tribunal has no doubt that the requirement
that there be an investment under the different treaties has been met.

5.3. The Legality of the Investment and the Requirement of Good Faith

5.3.1 Preliminary remark

The legality of the investment and the good faith of Claimant are central issues in the
present dispute and have been intensively debated by the Parties. They may be
determinative for both the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and the merits of the dispute and are
intertwined.

In the context of the merits, the question centers on the investor’s perspective and on the
potential impact of the legality of its investment on this perspective. For the appreciation of
the jurisdictional dimension, the expectations of the State are determinative.

In exchange for their acceptance to enter into investment treaties and giving their consent
to the resolution of investment disputes by arbitral tribunals, States expect that such
protection would extend only to investments that have been made lawfully

In the present case, the principle of legality is specified in Article 2 of the BIT which
provides:

Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote, as far as possible, investments by investors
of the other Contracting Party and admit such investments in accordance with its legislation.

Although the text of the ECT does not contain an explicit provision relating to the legality
of investments, the Tribunal is convinced that it likewise does not protect investments
made unlawfully. The Tribunal agrees with the award in Plama v. Bulgaria, where the
tribunal held:

Unlike a number of Bilateral Investment Treaties, the ECT does not contain a provision
requiring the conformity of the Investment with a particular law. This does not mean,
however, that the protections provided for by the ECT cover all kinds of investments,
including those contrary to domestic or international law.”“°

While the principle that an investment must be made legally in order to benefit from the
protection of international law is well established and accepted by this Tribunal, the
specificities of each case impose thorough scrutiny as to its applicability in specific
circumstances. This applies to considerations of both jurisdiction and merits.

5.3.2. Claimant’s position

Claimant contends that its investment was and is legal and was made in compliance with
all necessary permits and Governmental authorizations.

It asserts that for the three core elements of its investment, “[t]he Respondent did not even
argue that the shareholding in Mamidoil Albania or the Lease Contract concluded with
Respondent were illegal investments”
With respect to the tank farm, its argument is less straightforward. Claimant has insisted
that it has applied for and received the trading permit, the customs warehouse authorization
and — albeit belatedly due to Respondent’s fault — the environmental permit. It claims to
have applied for but not received — again due to Respondent’s fault — the exploitation
permit. Claimant declares that it did not find the application for the exploitation permit in
its files but submits secondary evidence which documents that the application was made."

Claimant further asserts that the environmental permit was “regarded as approved” since
the authorities failed to act on the application within 6 months.” This is allegedly
supported by Article 20.2 of the “Law on Environmental Protection”, dated 21 January
1993? as well as Article 38 of the successor “Law on Environmental Protection”, dated 5
September 2002.75! Under this logic, since Claimant applied for the permit on 10 May
2000, the application was considered approved in November of the same year.

As to the construction site permit and the construction permit, Claimant has repeatedly
alleged that it applied for them by its request of 3 July 1998 to approve the investment and

that the ensuing approval encompassed the permit. 252 Tt has further alleged that in addition
to the application in substance, “out of precaution and also because authorities suddenly
started to asking for building permits from the local authorities on the basis of the new

laws, Claimant filed for a construction site and construction permit’. 253

 

300. On other occasions, it has submitted that it might not have applied for the construction
permit on time but that it was not aware of this fact. It has insisted that the “Central
Government had substantively approved the project. The issuance of a local construction
permit, if at all necessary, was a mere formality”. 255 The fact that it was not able to

“obtain and present a formal construction site permit and a construction permit is no
serious violation of mandatory public order” and does not amount to illegality.°°°

301. In addition, it claims having received consistent oral assurances from high Government
officials that the investment was welcome and legal and that the formal requirements
would be taken care of. According to Claimant, even the Urban Planning Office advised
that no further construction permit is needed since “you already have one”?>"

302. Claimant points to the “inspection deed” of the “State Inspectorate of Oil, Gas Inspection
and their By Products”, dated 17 January 2005.7°* It states as follows:

1. The implementation of the approved projects on whose basis the construction permission, the
exploitation permission and the trading permission, is issued: The implementation is made in
line with the projects prepared by the Greek company “Tensor” s.a. which has also made the
installation. Certification has been done by Lloyd's.

2. The implementation of the technical deeds and our technical certificate regarding the granting
of permission: There are no unaccomplished tasks. There has been only the damage of the
terminal pipeline.

303. Claimant asserts that the legality is further documented by the fact that it received the
trading permit and operated the tank farm in full knowledge of the Albanian authorities and
that it paid regular taxes. When it started the investment, it did not know that a re-zoning of
the port of Durres was under discussion. At no point in time did the authorities contest the
legality but rather they regularly confirmed its right to conduct its business. Claimant

concludes that it is obvious that Respondent itself “was convinced of the legality of the

Claimant asserts that “not every possible breach of domestic legal requirements, however
formal these might be, leads to illegality of an investment under international law. The
case law is quite clear. Mere formal failures, such as the failure to obtain a permit which

would have been granted, are not sufficient to constitute illegality”.°°!

an

Claimant relies on Tokios Tokelés v. Ukraine where the tribunal noted that “minor errors”
and “a failure to observe the bureaucratic formalities of the domestic law” would not
amount to illegality.°°? It further relies on Desert Line v. Yemen where the tribunal found
that an investment could not be declared illegal because the investor had not applied for
and not received a certificate by a low-ranking investment authority that would
undoubtedly have been issued upon request “both because of the general endorsement of
the investment at the highest level of the State, and in light of the YIL benefits by the ad hoc

a

Claimant further asserts “that only a serious violation of domestic law, such as the
illegality of the investment per se, or fraud or corruption used in the acquisition of the
investment, can lead to illegality of the investment’?

307. In this connection, Claimant relies on Hamester v. Ghana, where the tribunal concluded:

An investment will not be protected if it has been created in violation of national or international
principles of good faith; by way of corruption, fraud, or deceitful conduct; or if its creation
itself constitutes a misuse of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID
Convention. It will also not be protected if it is made in violation of the host State’s law (as
elaborated, e.g. by the tribunal in Phoenix).?°>

deemed to offer access to the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism to investments made in violation of their laws. If
a State, for example, restricts foreign investment in a sector of its economy and a foreign investor disregards such
restriction, the investment concerned cannot be protected under the ICSID/BIT system. These are illegal investments
according to the national law of the host State and cannot be protected through an ICSID arbitral process. And it is
the Tribunal’s view that this condition — the conformity of the establishment of the investment with the national laws
— is implicit even when not expressly stated in the relevant BIT. |...] The core lesson is that the purpose of the
international protection through ICSID arbitration cannot be granted to investments that are made contrary to law.

60

308. Claimant also points to the award in Quiborax v. Bolivia, where the tribunal found that the
legality requirement is limited to non-trivial violations, violations of the host State’s
investment regimes and fraud.

309. In any event, Claimant contends that “illegality is a matter of merits and not of
jurisdiction”, and the jurisdictional objection of illegality is unfounded.””

310. Claimant summarizes this strand of arguments by insisting that Respondent “has failed to
explain how the lack of or late application for permit caused substantive and serious
illegality”, that it had thoroughly discussed the project with Respondent, that it received the
Ministries’ approval for the investment, and that the “Respondent’s authorities never
during the operation of the tank farm questioned its legal validity or ordered its
demolition”?

311.

In a different vein, Claimant asserts that Respondent is barred from relying on an alleged
illegality for two related reasons.

312. Firstly, Claimant alleges that the failure to issue the necessary permits after having
approved the project and executed the lease was in itself a violation of the fair and
equitable treatment standard, which “prohibits the State to act contradictory in
administrative proceedings”. 269

313. Claimant also refers to Article 3 of the Swiss-Albanian BIT, which it claims can be
invoked through the MEN clause contained in Article 3 of the Greek-Albanian BIT. This
article provides that the Contracting States will issue all necessary authorizations to
admitted investors.”””

314. Claimant argues that Respondent was obliged to issue the permits. To the extent that it did
not, it failed to fulfil its obligations under international law. It would profit from its own

The fact that an investment is in violation of the laws of the host State can be manifest and will therefore allow the
tribunal to deny its jurisdiction. [...|Of course, the analysis of the conformity of the investment with the host State's
laws has to be performed taking into account the laws in force at the moment of the establishment of the investment.
[...] There is no doubt that the requirement of the conformity with law is important in respect of the access to the
substantive provisions on the protection of the investor under the BIT. This access can be denied through a decision
on the merits. However, if it is manifest that the investment has been performed in violation of the law, it is in line
with judicial economy not to assert jurisdiction.” Phoenix Action Lid v. Czech Republic, ICSID Case No.

315. Secondly, Claimant asserts that Respondent is estopped from invoking illegality.
316. Claimant relies on Kardassopolos v. Georgia, where the tribunal found:

In the Tribunal’s view, Respondent cannot simply avoid the legal effect of the representations
and warranties set forth in the JVA and the Concession by arguing that they are contained in
agreements which are void ab initio under Georgian law. The assurances given to Claimant
regarding the validity of the JVA and the Concession were endorsed by the Government itself,
and some of the most senior Government officials of Georgia (including, inter alia, President
Gamsakhurdia, President Shevardnadze, Prime Minister Sigua and Prime Minister Gugushvili)
were closely involved in the negotiation of the JVA and the Concession. The Tribunal also notes
that the Concession was signed and “ratified” by the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, an organ of
the Republic of Georgia.

 

The Tribunal further observes that in the years following the execution of the JVA and the
Concession by SakNavtobi and Transneft, respectively, Georgia never protested nor claimed
that these agreements were illegal under Georgian law. In light of all of the above
circumstances, the Tribunal is of the view that Respondent created a legitimate expectation for
Claimant that his investment was, indeed, made in accordance with Georgian law and, in the
event of breach, would be entitled to treaty protection. [...,]

The Tribunal is comforted in this finding by the decision of the ICSID Tribunal in the case of
Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Egypt. [...]

It is possible that under Egyptian law certain acts of Egyptian officials, including even
Presidential Decree No. 475, may be considered legally non-existent or null and void or
susceptible to invalidation. However, these acts were cloaked with the mantle of Governmental
authority and communicated as such to foreign investors who relied on them in making their
investments. Whether legal under Egyptian law or not, the acts in question were the acts of
Egyptian authorities, including the highest executive authority of the Government. These acts,
which are now alleged to have been in violation of the Egyptian municipal legal system, created
expectations protected by established principles of international law. A determination that these
acts are null and void under municipal law would not resolve the ultimate question of
liability for damages suffered by the victims who relied on the acts. If the municipal law
does, not provide a remedy, the denial of any remedy whatsoever cannot be the final answer.
|

317. In this connection, Claimant alleges:

Not only had Government ministers solicited and authorized the project and entered into the
twenty-year leasing contract, but also for years afterwards no authority, whether central or
municipal, doubted the legality of construction and operation of the tank farm. Those

authorities were aware of the tank farms, issued permits, but never challenged the legality of the
tank farm’s construction and operation.””*

Claimant refers to a World Bank mission report, which quotes a Minister as having
approved the construction of the new tank farms.” It also refers to a newspaper interview
where the newly elected Prime Minister Ilir Meta told reporters:

I would like to underscore that the Meta government is the first government that has approved a
master plan of the World Bank for the development of at least 20 years of Durres Port. Such a
thing is of huge importance not only for Albania, [...] during the Meta government no contract
has been signed with a local or foreign company for the exploitation of the territories of Durres
port. These are inherited contracts [referring to the lease contract of Claimant and the other two
Greek investors] they are legal ones, which implies that the current government, although is not
accountable for the signing, cannot avoid the legal and financial obligation arising to the
Albanian state due to non-observation.””°

Claimant finally quotes from a letter of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Energy, dated
14 April 2010, which states that the activity of Claimant “for depositing and trading
naphtha sub-products in the rented zones in the territory of Durres harbour” is not
impeded and that the trading license and lease remain intact.°”°

Claimant summarizes this strand of arguments by insisting that for 12 years Albanian
authorities never challenged the legality of its activities and, as a result, they are now
estopped from asserting illegality.

Claimant further argues that it acted at all times bona fide while Respondent acted mala
fide.

Claimant contends that it worked consistently and diligently in order to obtain all necessary
permits and authorizations. It was partly frustrated in its effort and partly assured that the
approval of the investment by the central Government included the necessary permits.
When the authorities suddenly started to ask for construction site and construction permits,
Claimant applied for them. It thus had no reason to assume that the tank farm might not
comply with legal requirements.”

As to Respondent’s re-zoning plans and the report by Louis Berger Inc., Claimant alleges
that it was not aware of the Government’s plans until the letter of 21 July 2000, when the

5.3.3. Respondent’s position

Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because neither the Greek-
Albanian BIT nor the ECT protects investments that are illegal, nor do they allow investors
to bring claims against a sovereign State when they have acted in bad faith: “Claimant’s
purported investment has never acquired any legal status under Albanian law, and cannot
now provide the basis for a claim under international law” 2”

Respondent alleges that the investment has to be appraised as a whole and cannot be
divided into purportedly legal and illegal parts such as the lease, the shares in the Albanian
subsidiary and the tank farm. The whole project presents a unity centered on the operation
of the tank farm without which the lease contract would not have made economic sense
and no subsidiary would have been created. According to Respondent, the illegality of the
tank farm infected the totality of the investment.”*°

Respondent relies on doctrine that clearly supports that “the entire operation directed at
the investment’s overall economic goal”?! has to be identified, and in this connection,
Respondent refers to case law that considers the totality of “assets” and not just single
assets in isolation.

Respondent further asserts that Claimant did not apply, timely or otherwise, for the four
required “important permits”?* — the importance being explicitly recognized in the
language used by Claimant — and that the permits were never granted.”**

Respondent contends that under Albanian law — which is not different from most other
legal systems in the world — before any construction begins, an investor must apply for a
construction site permit and a construction permit according to the “Law for Urban
Planning”, dated 17 September 1998.85 This Law was applicable to Claimant’s project

which received approval in principle in early 1999, the site being possessed by Claimant
September 1999,°86

The purpose of the Law is to enhance the “following policies [...]: the current and future
economic and social development at the national and local level, national defense,
environmental protection, preservation and implementation of urban planning,
architectural and archeological values, the protection of legitimate interests related to
private property” ?*"

Respondent has described the process of application as detailed in the law. It points to the
clear provisions on the recipient of the application, the form of the application including
the completion of forms attached to the law, the submission of accompanying documents,
and the distribution of competences between the central and local level for the issuance of
the permits.

Respondent deduces from these requirements that the request for the approval of the
investment of July 1998 does not fulfil the minimum requirements of a valid application.

It also alleges that the forms, which Claimant submitted together with its Reply, do not
fulfill these requirements because they are not dated (they carry only a date of a notarial
stamp), they are incomplete, and they are not accompanied by supporting documents. In
addition, they give rise to suspicion and doubts as to their authenticity.7**

Respondent further asserts that the competent authorities at the central and local
Government levels never examined or approved, let alone issued, the construction site and
construction permits.

Respondent points to Article 76 of the law, which provides that “[b]uildings without
permits are considered illegal” and that “no indemnity or expropriation shall be made for
illegal buildings”. The investment is therefore “illegal per se. As a consequence, its
investment is deprived of the protections offered by the BIT, the ECT and the ICSID
Convention”?

Respondent notes that Claimant has not initiated any of the exceptional proceedings to
legalize the construction as provided in Article 79 of the law”? and that it is too late for
Claimant to legalize its activities.

As to the environmental permit, its prerequisites are provided for in the “Law on
Environmental Protection”, dated 21 January 1993, whose objective is to protect the
environment and natural resources, including the “water ecosystems, atmosphere, soil
ecosystems [.. yt

Respondent asserts that according to Article 18 of the law as applicable in 1999, Claimant
was obliged to apply for the permit before the start of construction. The fact that it failed to
do so renders the construction of the tank farm illegal. The fact that it later — in 2007 —
received a temporary permit in accordance with the new law is irrelevant, first because the
permit did not pertain to the construction but only to storage and trading, and second
because it does not have retroactive effect.

Respondent summarizes its position by stating that since Article 24 of the Law provides
that activities performed without an environmental permit “shall be closed down,
prohibited or interrupted totally or partially”, Claimant’s investment is illegal and not
protected by the BIT, the ECT or the ICSID Convention.”?

As to the exploitation permit, Respondent disputes Claimant’s assertion that it applied for
the permit and that the Albanian authorities had failed to issue it.

It alleges that a first and incomplete application was submitted after the beginning of
operations of the tank farm, contrary to the requirements of the “Law on Control and
Regulation of Construction Works” dated 10 September 1998.74 Despite repeated requests
from the Ministry of Economy in 2003 and 2004 to Claimant to submit the application and
the relevant documentation, in particular the testing certificates, Claimant failed to comply
with the legal requirements.

Respondent submits that “[t]ie Government took a lenient good faith stance towards
Mamidoil Albanian but pointed out in clear and unequivocal terms that the illegal situation
could not endure”?

Respondent insists that the illegalities were never cured, notwithstanding the granting of
the trading license, since that license has no connection to the construction of the tank
farm, concerns exclusively the right to conduct a wholesale business in the port of Durres
and “did not and could not retroactively legalize the construction of the fuel tank, nor
could it or did it amount to a waiver of the other required permits and regulations” °°

2005, which did not concern the construction of the tank farm but rather the inspection of
the technical standard and security. The answers were in reply to standardized questions,
which were based on assumptions and did not imply that Claimant’s activities were
legal.?°”

Respondent asserts that the construction permits, the environmental permit and the
exploitation permit are required of any national or foreign, physical or legal, person and
that the permits serve important and serious public policy objectives in the fields of urban
planning, public health, social well-being, economic development, technical sustainability,
and nature and landscape protection. They are by no means trivial and demand respect and
compliance.

Respondent contends that Claimant’s failure to apply for and obtain the permits leads to
the consequence that the investment is neither “in accordance with its legislation”, as
explicitly required by Article 2 of the Greek-Albanian BIT, nor is it protected by the ECT,
which equally does not extend its dispute settlement mechanism to investments that are
“contrary to domestic or international law”, as affirmed by the arbitral tribunal in Plama v.
Bulgaria. 298

Respondent asserts, “independent[ly] of specific language to this effect in the applicable
treaty [...] the illegality of an investment does constitute a bar to jurisdiction. This has
been confirmed by numerous tribunals, including the tribunals in Phoenix _y. Czech
Republic, Jan Oostergetel y. Slovak Republic, Anderson vy. Costa Rica, Tokios Tokelés v.
Ukraine and Alpha Projektholding v. Ukraine”.*””

 

Respondent quotes from these decisions and awards, which use similar language to the
tribunal in Saba Fakes v. Turkey, which stated:

the BIT protection shall not apply to investments which have not been established in conformity

with Respondent’s laws and regulations [...]. If this condition is not satisfied, the BIT does

not apply. As a result, the Contracting Party cannot be deemed to have given its consent to

347. Respondent further contends that Claimant has incorrectly asserted that jurisprudence has
restricted the illegality criterion “exclusively to cases of ‘fraud’, ‘corruption’ or illegality
of the investment ‘as such 301 The awards and decisions quoted to this effect have
consistently pointed to fraud and corruption as obvious examples but not as exclusive
circumstances. *°”

348. Respondent admits that “tribunals have distinguished between serious and minor
violations of the host State’s law”, 3 such as registration as “subsidiary private enterprise”
instead of “subsidiary enterprise’ or a failure to re-register, *°> but insists that these
circumstances are radically different from the case at hand:

19304

Clearly, the minor administrative errors allegedly committed by Tokios Tokelés and Alpha
Projektholding stand in no comparison with the multiple and independent serious violations of
mandatory public order provisions under Albanian law [...] that Mamidoil Albanian,
intentionally or negligently, committed. The failure to obtain the required construction,
exploitation and environmental permits for the construction and exploitation of a petroleum
tank farm does not, under any standard, qualify as a “failure to observe the bureaucratic
formalities”** and cannot be disingenuously downplayed as trivial, as Claimant seeks to do.*°

349. Respondent further asserts that it violated neither the fair and equitable treatment standard
of the ECT nor Article 3 of the Swiss-Albanian BIT when it did not issue the relevant
permits.

350. Respondent conceded that it might otherwise be liable if it had formally authorized the

had refused to issue the permits. To support this argument, Respondent relies on MTD v.
Chile, where the tribunal found that “[t]o the extent that the application for a permit
meets the requirements of the law, then, in accordance with the BIT and Article 3(2) of
the Croatia BIT, the investor should be granted such permit’. 308

required by law. Had it done so, “the competent authorities would have assessed the

requirements set by law were satisfied”.

352. Respondent further asserts that it is not estopped from invoking the illegality of the
investment, stating that “[i]n view of the far-reaching consequences (namely: a loss of

right) estoppel only operates as a_ binding preclusion in [...] exceptional

circumstances” *\°

353. Respondent relies on Chevron v. Ecuador where the tribunal found that:

. estoppel and waiver are subject to a high threshold. Any right leads normally and
automatically to a claim for its holder. It is only in very exceptional circumstances that a holder
of a right can nevertheless not raise and enforce the resulting claim.*!!

354. Respondent contends that this threshold has not been reached in this case. It states that:

ICSID case law demonstrates that in cases where an estoppel-defense was raised by investors to
counter allegations of illegality, tribunals have consistently held that a State may be
estopped from invoking the illegality of the investment only where it is demonstrated that the
State knowingly overlooked a failure to comply with its law and furthermore endorsed an
investment which was not in compliance with its laws.

Tribunals have moreover concluded that where the investor was aware of the illegality or did

not have any legitimate reason to believe that its investment was legal, estoppel does not
312

apply.

355. Respondent alleges that in the present case:

- it did not know at the beginning that Claimant had built the tank farm without
availing itself of the necessary permits, that it never acknowledged that
Claimant’s behavior was legal, and that when it found out about the lack of
permits it clearly and unequivocally insisted that the situation be remedied,*"*

- “[t]he impugned illegalities are not attributable to Respondent, but are exclusively
the product of Claimant’s own negligence, if not its intentional disregard of
mandatory requirements under Albanian law” 314

356. Respondent finally asserts that Claimant made its investment in bad faith and that,

357.

according to international law, such an investment falls outside the jurisdiction of
international arbitral tribunals. Respondent states that it consented to the jurisdiction of
ICSID only for good faith conduct of potential investors.

315

In this connection, Respondent relies on Phoenix v. Czech Republic where the tribunal
stated:

States cannot be deemed to offer access to the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism to
investment not made in good faith. The protection of international investment arbitration cannot
be granted if such protection would run contrary to the general principles of international law,
among which the principle of good faith is of utmost importance.”"

358. Respondent accordingly concludes that:

that Claimant rushed in and made its investment without prior due diligence;

that Claimant started to construct the tank farm on the basis of an internal approval
of the investment and of a lease contract without any further documentation and
without official, written assurances by competent high Government authorities;

that Claimant recklessly disregarded warnings of an upcoming change of the Durres
port area, which was made in the public interest and backed by international
organizations;

that Claimant failed to apply for important permits that are unequivocally and
transparently requested by law in order to maintain the public, social,
environmental and economic interests of the State, although it was aware that these
permits would be necessary for the construction and operation of the tank farm to
be legal;

that Claimant ignored good faith requests by Respondent to apply for the permits
under the established procedure after the termination of the construction, which
would have allowed Respondent to find ways to cure the illegalities.*"”

5.3.4 The Determination of the Tribunal

As stated in the preliminary remarks, the Tribunal shares the widely-held opinion that
investments are protected by international law only when they are made in accordance with
the legislation of the host State. States accept arbitration and accept to waive part of their
immunity from jurisdiction to encourage and protect investments in international
conventions. In doing so, they cannot be expected to have agreed to extend that mechanism
to investments that violate their laws; likewise, it cannot be expected that States would
want illegal investments by their nationals to be protected under those international
conventions.

This principle is reiterated in Article 2 of the Greek-Albanian BIT, and likewise applies to
the substance of the protection when the relevant international instrument, such as the ECT
in this case, does not specifically refer to a requirement of legality.

The Tribunal will hereinafter address the different issues disputed by the Parties.
The first issue concerns the composition of the investment.

On one occasion, Claimant distinguished between Claimant’s shares in the Albanian
subsidiary “Mamidoil Albanian”, the lease contract executed between “Mamidoil
Albanian” and the Ministry and Privatization, as well as the construction of the tank farm
and operation of the tank farm. At the same time, Claimant has insisted that “Mamidoil
Albanian is not Claimant in this case; it is Mamidoil”?'* Claimant insists that Respondent
has not challenged the legality of either the shares or of the lease.

Respondent has argued that the composite parts of the investment form a whole and must
be considered together.

The Tribunal has considered the factual circumstances of the investment and found that, as
already stated in chapter 4.1 of this Award, the different components cannot be seen in
isolation. The sole objective of the lease was “[flor setting up a fuel storage center”
Article 2).°'° Claimant created and controlled the subsidiary again with the sole objective
to construct and operate the tank farm and conduct the import and trade of petroleum
products. It financed the construction partly by loans, which were later converted into
shares. The senior management, except for a temporary local partner, was seconded by
Claimant’s Greek headquarters.

373.

The three elements considered above form a unity. The Tribunal thus does not have to treat
the question of whether Claimant can assert rights under a lease to which it was not
formally a party. It considers the lease to be an integral part of the investment.

Likewise, the nature and fate of the investment pertaining to the construction and operation
of the tank farm extends automatically to all other components. The lease without storage
facilities makes no economic sense, and the raison d’étre of the fully-controlled and, after
2006, fully-owned subsidiary is equally bound to the construction and operation of the tank
farm.

Claimant itself agrees to such an encompassing view when it asserts: “[w]Je do not say that
the leasing contract as such has been breached. What we say is that the investment which
is the company which operates the tank farm on the leased property has been strangled off
and indirectly expropriated” °°

In sum, the Tribunal finds that the components of the investment form an inseparable
whole and that the determination of the legality of the construction and/or operation of the
tank farm would affect its totality.

Respondent has challenged the legality of the investment on two counts. It alleges first that
Claimant failed to perform any due diligence, rushed in recklessly and built the petroleum
reservoir at a moment when it was obvious that the transport sector and the seaports in
particular would soon undergo a fundamental re-structuring and re-zoning, in particular in
the densely populated port of Durres. It further alleges that in order to present Respondent
with a fait accompli, it did not bother to avail itself of fundamental permits, which it knew
were important and to be received before the construction started.

The Tribunal realizes that the two allegations aim at different dimensions of potential
illegality, the first at a violation of substantive law, and the second at a violation of
procedural rules.

The Tribunal finds that an investment can be illegal and as a consequence not protected by
investment conventions when it contravenes substantive law, in other words when it does
not comply with material norms regulating investments. Norms may prohibit certain
business activities, such as the production of drugs, or they may reserve certain sectors to
national entities or protect certain sectorial or geographical areas, for example, by making
an investment in a national park illegal.

The Tribunal agrees in this respect with Phoenix v. The Czech Republic where the tribunal
found:

If a State, for example, restricts foreign investment in a sector of its economy and a foreign
investor disregards such restriction, the investment concerned cannot be protected under the
ICSID/BIT system. These are illegal investments according to the national law of the host State
and cannot be protected through an ICSID arbitral proc

 

In the present case, the master plan for Durres provided for a prohibition on the landing of
petroleum products at the port, and Respondent alleges that Claimant, had it conducted due
diligence, should have known that this development was inevitable and that, in any event,
it was informed accordingly before it started construction.

The Tribunal rejects this argument. The decisive moment for the appreciation of the
investment’s substantive legality is when the investment is planned and made. When the
Parties executed the lease and when the site was transferred into Claimant’s possession,
neither Party anticipated the changes and restrictions on the port of Durres.

When the new master plan entered into force in June 2000 and when Respondent tried to
enforce it in July 2000 by ordering the interruption of the construction, these events could
not retroactively render the investment illegal. This is all the more so since Respondent
later explicitly authorized Claimant to terminate the tank farm and to operate it for the
totality of the term of the lease.

For these reasons, the Tribunal is convinced that the investment is not tainted by illegality
as a substantive matter and rejects the arguments to the contrary.

The second source of possible illegality concerns procedural rules. In the Tribunal’s view,
an investment can be found illegal for procedural reasons when the investor does not
respect the norms regulating the process of investment. The investment may be legal in
substance but still tainted by illegality when the investor violates procedural norms and
regulations for setting up its investment. Fraud and corruption are prominent examples of
such behavior. However, such serious contraventions of law are not alleged in this case.

The Tribunal has to determine whether Claimant has applied for a number of permits
which are necessary for the construction and operation of the tank farm and whether
Respondent has issued the respective permits. In case they were not applied for and/or not
issued, it has to determine whether the absence of any one of the permits is of a nature to
qualify the investment as illegal. If that turns out to be the case, the Tribunal has still to
determine whether Respondent is entitled to invoke illegality.

The Tribunal will examine the permits and their legal requirements one by one.

The construction site permit and the construction permit: The “Law on Urban Planning”,
dated 17 September 1998, is applicable to these permits.

There has been some debate between the Parties about whether the preceding law should
be applied. It entered into force on 29 April 1991 *°2 and was repealed through Article 86 of
the new law on 17 September 1998. The Tribunal does not see how this law could be
applicable. Both laws provide that a party that intends to build must first request a permit
for the site that it wants to use. In the present case, the Durres port authority handed the site
over to Claimant’s subsidiary on 1 September 1999, based on the lease contract dated 2
June 1999. Before these dates, no site was available. Therefore, the law of 1991, which
was repealed in 1998, cannot be applicable.

The Tribunal notes, however, that with respect to the form of applications, the new law
does not differ fundamentally from its predecessor. Both laws provide that the application
must follow certain formal requirements and be made on forms that are attached as parts of
the laws (cf. Articles 22 and 31 of the old Law; Articles 38 and 45 of the new Law).

Article 38 of the Law on Urban Planning describes in clear and unambiguous language:

Any foreign or domestic physical or juridical person who wants to construct an underground or
surface building structure must submit a request in writing, including any urban study, for the
approval of the building site and urban conditions. Requests for building sites shall be made
according to form no.1 that is attached to this law.

 

Article 39 describes in equally clear and unambiguous language to which authority the
application must be submitted. Likewise, Article 45 provides in equally clear and
unambiguous language that any party that wants to construct must apply for a construction
permit and then sets out — not different in form and substance from Article 38 — what
documentation must be attached.

Article 53 describes in clear and unambiguous language that in respect of structures above
a specified size, as defined in Article 7 of the law, the TACRA of the central Government
shall issue the permit. The tank farm enters into this category of buildings. This is not
contested between the Parties.

Any lawyer with some specialization in the field of administrative law would have been
able to give advice on these rather straightforward procedures.

Claimant chose not to employ a lawyer and not to seek advice on the application
requirements. Claimant’s witness Mr. Emmanouil Kalfas who had worked for Claimant

*3 Witness Statement of Mr. Emmanouil Kalf:

since 1971 and was its major counsel for the identification, preparation and implementation
i . 323 -
of investment in Durres*~ opined as follows:
Question: why did Mamidoil not, for example, instruct a law firm with the due diligence or the
legal and administrative requirements?

Mr. Kalfas: I don’t see the reason for that. If you are technically capable and you are contacting
the right authorities, then I don’t see why you need a lawyer.***

Question: Do you really think that it is reasonable to proceed with an investment without
knowing the legal framework required for the implementation of a project, especially a tank
farm? The licences, the permits, is that reasonable, according to you?

Mr. Kalfas: Absolutely. When we are talking about this type of investment, [...] we don’t need
a lawyer. [...] But to build the unit, the laws are there, regulations are there, I am there, and I
don’t need anybody else to guide me.*™

The Tribunal considers such an approach as unhelpful in fulfilling the obligation to comply
with the legal requirements of a host State for a foreign investment.

When Claimant submitted its request for the approval of the investment on 3 July 1998, it
stated that, “[flollowing this approval, we will continue our job for [...] getting the
respective permits for the accomplishment of the works”. 326

During that period, Claimant was aware that it needed more than the request to comply
with the Albanian legislation. In its Statement of Reply, Claimant alleged that the request
for the investment approval was at the same time the application for the construction
permit. 27 Th its opening statement at the hearing, it reiterated that it had made the
application, if not in form then in content. 328

The Tribunal rejects this argumentation. It is evident and was initially accepted by
Claimant that the request for the approval of the investment, alone or in conjunction with
the request for the lease contract, was not an application for a construction permit, neither
in content nor in form, let alone a construction site permit. Even a superficial reading of
the above-quoted articles of the Law on Urban Planning leave no doubt as to the
correctness of this finding.

Claimant submits that the Tribunal must take the special circumstances of the Albanian
administration into account. It alleges that according to its legal expert, Professor Dobjani,
“not even the government knew exactly what the procedures for the building of a tank farm

were”.*”? Claimant also states that the authorities were not helpful and did not guide it in
the accomplishments of its tasks.

To the Tribunal’s mind, this argument might be relevant to the proper issuance of the
permits. However, it is irrelevant with respect to the application. Claimant’s non-respect of
the content and the form of the applications for both permits are exclusively its own
responsibility. It also bore responsibility for complying with the legal requirement and for
coordinating with “the right authorities’ as underlined by Claimant’s consultant
Mr. Kalfas. The burden of initiating compliance with national legal requirements cannot be
shifted to Respondent.

Respondent’s legal expert, Mr. Neritan Kallfa, confirmed without hesitation that the
approval request does not represent a valid and necessary application for a construction site
permit and a construction permit.>*°

In his written opinion, Claimant’s legal expert, Professor Dobjani, did not specifically
mention the issue of application. However, he identified the central Government as the
competent body to approve the construction. The Tribunal assumes that the statement
implies that the application existed.**!

Professor Dobjani’s written opinion is ambiguous, both with respect to the application and
to the central Government’s approval. He resolved these ambiguities during the hearing.

When asked whether the “approval in principle” letter of 6 January 1999 was an approval
for the construction permit, he answered: “[n]o, if is not an approval. It is just a positive
opinion that the land they were asking for, which was under the jurisdiction of the port,
was available for investment”. He characterized the letter as meaning. “[i]n general, I
agree but we have to discuss the details”. When asked whether the lease contract is a

construction permit, he answered: “the lease contract is not a construction permit, of
ps 332

 

course’

Given these unequivocal statements of both legal experts on Albanian law and given the
Tribunal’s own reading and understanding of the Law on Urban Planning, the Tribunal
finds that Claimant did not apply for a construction site permit and/or a construction permit
when it requested the approval for the investment and executed the lease contract.

The Tribunal has further examined two application forms for permits that correspond to
two of the forms attached to the Law on Urban Planning. Claimant submitted these forms

with its Reply, alleging that it has filed them when local authorities suddenly started to ask
for building permits. Respondent has questioned the authenticity of the forms and
criticized that they were incomplete and not accompanied by adequate documentation.***

The Tribunal agrees that the forms are incomplete and not dated. One carries a notarial
stamp with the date of 31 August 2001. What troubles the Tribunal more, however, is that
the alleged signatory, Mr. Alexandros Mamidakis, who is the deputy managing director of
Mamidoil Jetoil and who was the general director of Mamidoil Albanian, declared that he
had never seen the forms before the hearing and had not signed them. When asked, “[s]o
you say these applications which were submitted by your counsel with the reply were forms
which were not filled by you and not signed by you, and you don’t know who signed that
and who filled them?” his answer was “[y]es, that’s correct” 3°

In its closing statement during the hearing, counsel for Claimant submitted: “[a]s
understand, [...] it was Tasos Mavrakis who explained it is not unusual for someone else to
sign for someone. For example, in Germany it would be legal to authorize my associate
here to sign in my name [J

The Tribunal does not know the details of Albanian law. It excludes, however, that a
signature and a document carrying such signature is valid if the alleged signatory has
neither signed the document, nor authorized a third person to sign it, nor even named a
third party for signature. The Tribunal rejects therefore the assertion that the forms are
valid applications for a construction site permit and a construction permit.

The Tribunal has to determine whether the approval in principle and the lease, together
with numerous verbal encouragements by high Government officials and politicians,
qualify as a construction site permit and a construction permit in the absence of formally
valid applications. Further, even if the documents and verbal assurances did not qualify as
permits in a formal sense, the Tribunal must decide if they would fulfil the requirement of
an approval in principle by the central Government in accordance with the Law on Urban
Planning, upon which the actual permits would not be more than a trivial formality.

Respondent’s legal expert has categorically denied such a possibility. He argued that the
approval in principle met neither the formal nor the substantive requirements of either of
the Laws on Urban Planning because the approval did not contain the legally required
information and was signed by a non-competent Government body. It was “not a blanket

authorization. At the most, it meant that Claimant could start the process of applying for
all necessary permits” *"

In his written opinion, Claimant’ s legal expert explained in general terms that the central
Government “had exclusive competence to issue the approval for construction sites such as
the leased and in principle it was the competent authority to approve the construction
permit’. The further steps were “a mere formality”.>** The expert did not give a clear
answer in his opinion to the question whether the “approval in principle” letter and the
lease qualified as such an approval. As pointed out in paragraphs 397-398 of this Award,
during his oral presentation he unequivocally stated that both documents did not qualify as
an approval under the Laws on Urban Planning.

Given the unequivocal statements of both legal experts on Albanian law and given the
Tribunal’s own reading and understanding of the Law on Urban Planning, the Tribunal
does not hesitate to find that Respondent did not issue a construction site permit and/or a
construction permit.

Does the result change given that that several high-level politicians and Government
members gave assurances? In fact, Claimant’s witnesses, members of the senior
management and members the family who own Claimant unanimously told the Tribunal
that during frequent meetings, Ministers expressed enthusiasm and assured the partners to
go ahead with the project and that missing formalities would be brought into order.
Respondent expressed doubts as to the content of these discussions.

The Tribunal does not doubt that the meetings took place, that politicians made political
declarations, encouraged the Claimant in general terms and made positive remarks on
compliance with formalities. However, all of these friendly discussions remained on the
level of verbal exchanges; none resulted in an agreed letter of intent, in any type of formal
representations or in recorded minutes of meetings. On the contrary, when Claimant made
its request for the approval of the investment, it took more than six months and at least one
reminder by Claimant until the director of the port authority finally gave his approval.
According to Claimant’s legal expert, the resulting letter did not amount to more than a
first step before discussion of the details of the project. It took another five months before
the lease was executed and another three months before the site was handed over. On these
facts, the Tribunal does not see evidence of legally relevant representations of high-ranking
and competent members of the Albanian Government.

The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that these circumstances differ widely from those
described in Desert Line v. Yemen. They are not of a nature to express legally binding

assurances and approvals, against which a final formal certificate or permit might have
been no more than a minor and trivial formality.

On the other hand, the Tribunal has to assess whether Claimant was entitled to rely on
verbal assurances and approvals, made without adherence to the formal procedure. Relying
on the World Bank’s “Doing Business 2013”, Claimant asserts that competences of
Albanian officials were conflicting and chaotic, TACRA did not meet for years, and no
building would ever be constructed if one relied on its formal approval.>”

Both legal experts contradict the World Bank’s findings. Respondent’s experts assured:

I live in Tirana, and I am saying that when it comes to infrastructure, industrial, if there are
foreign investments in that sector, the whole system works in order to make this appropriate.
And I have my own practice. We work for big groups, like in the airport, even the port, and
everything was somehow addressed in advance, addressed in particular in advance from
TACRA, So if you see the decision taken from TACRA, you see the main projects are
spotted.”

For his part, Claimant’s expert added:

 

Has the national TACRA been operational? I have seen that it has been [...]. Every two or three

months it has met.

The Tribunal has no reason not to believe these informed and concurring statements. The
fact that Albanian authorities may work recognizably slower than in other countries is no
reason to disregard their work and authorizations.

The Tribunal has also to assess whether the absence of formal construction permits was set
off by the fact that Respondent never challenged the legality of the construction, never
imposed any sanctions and never dismantled the tank farm. Claimant alleges that these
facts are an implicit acknowledgement of the investment’s legality. It adds that by acts and
words subsequent to the construction and attributable to Respondent, Respondent has
explicitly recognized and established the legality of the investment.*” In this connection, it
enumerates the following acts and statements:

- The acknowledgment of Minister Nako vis-a-vis a World Bank mission that the

Government would have to identify funds to compensate the investors in the port of

The Tribunal notes that the different allegations are not related to and do not have any
bearing on the construction permits. It does not share Claimant’s appreciation of the facts.
As to the general attitude of Respondent, it is true that it never imposed sanctions and did
not order the destruction of the tank farm as the law provided. Yet, the decision not to
impose sanctions must not be confounded with an implicit issuance of a permit.
Conversely, Respondent repeatedly requested that the situation concerning the missing
permits be regularized. Claimant reports that Respondent’s “authorities suddenly started to
asking [sic] for building permits from the local authorities”.*“* That must have been
around 2001, by which time the forms had been made available. This obligation was
further stressed during a ministerial meeting of a working group when a Government
representative stated that “for the fuel storage deposits that were built, [...] we observe that
these companies have submitted technical documentation in the project phase, which have
not been approved by the respective bodies of the local government in compliance with
Albanian law. In particular [...)’3” The fact that the construction permits are not
explicitly mentioned does not support the conclusion that Respondent considered that
obligation to have been satisfied. The Tribunal is willing to accept Respondent’s assertion
that “Respondent took a lenient good faith stance towards Mamidoil Albanian but pointed
out in clear and unequivocal terms that the illegal situation could not endure”.**°

As to the specific acts and words, the Tribunal has not found an acknowledgment to the
effect that the construction was legal despite the non-application for the construction
permits and despite the absence of these permits. In fact, both Prime Minister Meta and
Minister Nako spoke about contractual rights and made no remark on administrative legal

requirements. Both officials had taken office not long before they made the statement. The
Tribunal finds it improbable that they were aware of the technicalities as far as the
construction permits of Claimant were concerned, that they intended to say that the
investment was legal despite their absence and that their remarks substituted for their
issuance.

The Tribunal also finds that the inspection deed of January 2005 does not establish any
permit but assumes that the construction, environmental and trading “permissions” had
been issued. The deed is a demonstration of Prof. Dobjani’s findings, according to which
good governance was lacking after the pyramid crisis and, in particular, intra-governmental
cooperation did not work well. The inspector delivered a convincing professional analysis
in-and-of itself and for the stated purpose. At the same time, it was not aware of the state
proceedings that involved other departments even within the same Ministry. In the
Tribunal’s view, the deed does not substitute for or prove the existence of construction
permits.

With respect to the customs warehouse certificate, the Tribunal has studied Mamidoil
Albanian’s internal memorandum of 14 September 2001.3! It is obvious that the
construction permits do not figure among the documents required for the certificate. In the
Tribunal’s view, the certificate does not prove the existence of the permits.

With respect to the authorization to resume the construction work of December 2000 and
the issuance of the temporary trading permit, which followed Respondent’s order of July
2000 to interrupt the construction, the Tribunal understands that Respondent faced a
dilemma.

On the one hand, it was eager to implement the program of modernization of the transport
sector and the new orientation of the port of Durres, as recommended by the World Bank
and other donors and international experts. The Government considered these public policy
choices as “of very huge importance not only for Albania, but also for the development of a
great part of Southeastern Europe*”. It is in this perspective that Albania adopted the
new land use master plan for Durres in June 2000. The dates correspond with the period of
a World Bank mission. The mission had voiced concerns about the situation in the port of
Durres and strongly recommended a de-localization of the petroleum-related activities.**
The mission report preceded the order to stop the construction by one week.

On the other hand, Respondent was eager to accommodate Claimant and the other Greek
petroleum importers that were in the process of building their reservoirs in the port of

Durres. That was all the more so after the political and diplomatic interventions of the
Greek Government, Albania’s most important trade partner, which continued for several
years and which urged Albania to allow Claimant, a Greek investor, to go ahead with the
construction and later the operation of the tank farms.

The resulting negotiations between Respondent, Claimant and the Greek Government as
well as the Albanian decisions center on this dilemma and the policy issues of re-zoning
and re-localization. The problem was exacerbated by the fact that any non-Greek
newcomer in the petroleum sector would be banned from Durres.

The Tribunal is convinced that these considerations motivated the central Government to
authorize the completion of construction and to issue a temporary trading license.
Respondent did not immediately enforce the new Land Use Plan for Durres against
Claimant and the other Greek investors.

For the Greek companies, this politically-motivated arrangement had a welcome side effect
bearing on further development: While Respondent banned all other importers of
petroleum products from Durres to their competitive disadvantage, Claimant and the other
Greek companies continued to profit from the privileged situation of the port of Durres and
from its installations, which had survived the breakdown of the ancien régime.

Under these circumstances, it would have been inappropriate for Claimant to assume that
the issue of construction permits had become redundant and that it was dispensed from
pursuing the legally imposed obligation of submitting applications.

For these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the argument that the authorization to complete the
construction of the tank farm encompasses in substance and content the construction
permits. Claimant was allowed to resume the construction and benefit from the physical
and legal status as it had existed before the order to suspend the works. The status of the
lack of permits had not changed.

As for the trading permit, the Tribunal has studied the legal requirements and has not found
that its validity has as a prerequisite a construction permit.

For all these reasons, the Tribunal finds that no construction site permit or construction
permit was ever applied for or granted.

The consequence of the absence of the two permits is clearly stated in Articles 76 and 78 of
the Law on Urban Planning: “Buildings without permits are considered illegal’. Such
constructions are not entitled to any indemnity for expropriation resulting from the
implementation of urban plans.

Both legal experts on Albanian law support this conclusion, with Claimant’s legal expert
insisting that “[t]he construction police had full authority and full opportunities to go and

436.

close down that construction, if the Port Authority had informed them. [...] I don’t know, I
oy 354

can’t explain why they didn’t’.
The law states that the competent authority “makes its decision for the demolition” (Article
79), which the Tribunal understands to imply that it may also decide against demolition.
The Tribunal will determine in due course whether the decision not to demolish the tank
farm has legal significance.

Respondent’s legal expert opined in turn that the illegal construction could not be legalized
under the provisions of Article 79 of the Law of Urban Planning because the requirement
of the approved site, as stipulated in Article 78, was not fulfilled.*°° The Tribunal
understands both norms in this same sense and recalls that no construction site permit had
been issued.

The Tribunal thus concludes that the construction was illegal and not legalized.
The environmental permit: The Tribunal acknowledges that the Parties do not contest:

- The necessity of such permit, which follows from the unambiguous wording of
Article 18 of the “Law on Environmental Protection”, dated 21 January 1993,>°°
which was in force when Claimant built the tank farm.; the successor “Law on
Environmental Protection”*”’ entered into force on 5 September 2002, i.e. after the

completion of construction;

- That Claimant applied for an environmental permit on 10 May 2000, when the
construction was underway;

- That a temporary environmental permit was issued on 31 May 2007; and

- That between the first application and the issuance of the permit, Claimant filed a
second application to accommodate the new Law, that several inspections by
diverse agencies took place and that some correspondence was exchanged between
the Parties.

The Tribunal notes that Article 17 of the Law of 1993 provides that “physical or juridical
persons, who engage in economic and social activities that may have an impact on
environment, must obtain licenses [...]”. Article 18 provides that “[l]icenses shall be
provided for the following economic and social activities: [...] c) Construction of roads,
railways seaports, hydro technical plants, other industrial activities, [.

Respondent’s legal expert opined that “there can be no doubt that both the construction
and the operation of a fuel farm required, as a mandatory pre-condition, an environmental

Claimant’s legal expert has not given an opinion on the question.

The Tribunal does not follow the view of Respondent’s expert. The law mentions the
construction of roads, for example, but does not specify in a different provision that the
operation of these constructions required an additional license. The Tribunal interprets the
provision therefore as necessarily meaning that the term “construction” also encompasses
operations. A different interpretation would lead to the situation that a railway or another
industrial site might be constructed but not operated for lack of a license. The Tribunal
cannot imagine that this is what the law means to express.

Further, the Tribunal has not found a clear indication in Articles 17 to 20 that the request
for the permit must be filed before the beginning of the construction.

The Tribunal’s opinion seems to be shared by the competent Albanian authorities. Firstly,
they processed the request without complaining that it had not been made timely. There
was some controversy and correspondence on different topics but not on a late submission.
Secondly, they issued the permit for the “storage and trading fuels” but did not either
complain or impose sanctions for the absence of a different permit for construction.

Moreover, Claimant specified in its request that “it is building a facility in Durres Port?
that “will occupy a surface [...J3° > The wording clarifies that the tank farm was under
construction at the time of the request. Time passed, operations started and the competent
authorities issued the permit based on a request that was clearly submitted for both the
construction and operation phases. The authorities found that construction was completed
and a permit for that phase was moot. It apparently understood the request a well as Article
18 (c) of the Law to encompass operations.

In light of this interpretation, the Tribunal finds that Respondent applied for the
environmental permit in a timely manner and that the late issuance, which is at least partly
due to investigations and inspections, has no effect on its legality. In fact, both the old and
the new laws provide that a request, which is not acted on by the authorities within 6
months, is considered approved (Article 20 of the 1993 Law and Article 38 of the 2002
Law).

The Tribunal therefore concludes that with respect to the environmental permit, Claimant
made its investment in accordance with the Albanian legislation.

The exploitation permit: The Tribunal notes that the Parties do not contest:

- The necessity of the permit to be issued according to Article 13 of the “Law on
Control and Regulation of the Construction Works” of 10 September 1991.
However, the Parties are in disagreement as to its relevance: while Respondent
qualifies it as one of the important permits to establish the legality of an operation,
Claimant qualifies it as “a simple testing document: it simply requires that a testing
officer comes” to set up the “document which confirms that what you’ve built
accords to the technical standards”,* and

- That the permit was not issued.

The Tribunal further notes that the Parties are in dispute over the question of whether
Claimant had filed an application before September 2001 or only on 15 July 2003, after
repeated reminders by Respondent.

No application pre-dating the letter of 15 July 2003 is in evidence. Claimant explains that it
“could not retrieve the official application from its files” but its existence is proven by an
internal memorandum of the then General Manager of the subsidiary who stated, “[a]//
forms of tank meas , firefighting service, envir I branch are itted to the
urban planning of Albania” °°! The urban planning section is the correct recipient of the
application (Article 11 of the Law).

 

Respondent states that it has not received the application, which would have been untimely
362

anyway since it was not prepared before full operation of the tank farm.”
The Tribunal does not doubt that Claimant prepared its application and sent it, although it
is surprised that a copy of an important document for the regular operation of the
investment would not be kept on file.

The Tribunal also does not doubt that Respondent did not receive the application. In fact, it
has reminded Claimant several times to make applications: during a meeting of the
Working Group on relocation on 20 March 2003,*3 by letter dated 23 April 2003,7 by
letter dated 20 May 2003 36 and by an internal memorandum dated 30 March 2004.*°¢

In reaction to the letters, Claimant answered first by telefax dated 24 June 2003 stating,
“[a]lthough we followed your instructions, we regret we see the continuation of the old
familiar tactics of delay, with respect to the exploitation permits in Durres”.*®" In a letter
dated 15 July 2003, Claimant wrote, “[p]ursuant to the proceedings for being equipped
with the respective exploitation permits of the Deposits in Durres Port, at your request, we

are re-sending the study file of the fire protection scheme” °°

N

Under the factual circumstances, the Tribunal does not fully understand the reference to
“old familiar tactics of delay” because Claimant accepts that other permits for which valid
applications were made, such as the custom warehouse certificate, the temporary trading
license or the environmental permit, were correctly issued. The Tribunal rejects the
implicit accusation that Respondent refused to grant permits despite valid applications.

3. The Tribunal notes that Respondent considered Claimant’s letter of 15 July 2003 —
although incomplete — to be an application.*” Respondent complained that it was not
correctly documented, and since no further documents are in evidence it seems that
Claimant did not comply with this request. In any case, the exploitation permit was not
issued.

4. The Tribunal further notes that a number of inspections have been conducted over the
years:

- a first field inspection by Lloyd’s Register on 5 and 6 June 2001 which stipulated
that “[t]he above described tests and examinations were carried out with

satisfactory results”;>”°

- an extensive “Environmental Review for Durres Port Dredging Program and other
Activities” which led to an “Oil/Fuel Inspection and Analysis Report” which did
not solely focus on Claimant’s investment. It stated, in relation to Mamidoil’s tank
farm, that in general “the site [...] looked well maintained” but recommended
certain improvements;*”! and

- an inspection by the Albanian Ministry of Industry and Energetics State
Inspectorate on 17 January 2005, which noted that the implementation of the

security norms and conditions were “correct” and that “[t]here are no

unaccomplished tasks”. 37

The Tribunal has taken note of Claimant’s uncontested assertion “that despite these delays,
the tank farm operated with full knowledge of all authorities’.*”> The Tribunal does not
exclude that the “Jenient stance” which Respondent — in its own words*”* — took towards
the operation was also based on the informed certitude that the security norms and
technical standards had been satisfied.

This does not mean that the operation of the tank farm was legal, and it is true that from
2003 on, Respondent “pointed out in clear and unequivocal terms that the illegal situation
could not endure”.°”°

The Tribunal has studied the “Law on Control and Regulation of the Construction Works”
and agrees with the analysis of Respondent’s expert that the failure to obtain the
exploitation permit constitutes a violation of that law. Claimant did not operate the tank
farm in accordance with Albanian legislation because it had no exploitation permit.

However, the consequences of the violation are different than those set out in the Law on
Urban Planning. Firstly, the law avoids calling operation without a permit “illegal”, and
secondly, it does not explicitly authorize the authorities to stop the operation. Rather, it
enumerates sanctions consisting of different monetary fines (Article 15).

Instead of imposing fines, Respondent chose to offer that Claimant “make applications for
the missing permits, including the exploitation permit, with the competent authorities in an
attempt to cure (to the extent possible) its illegalities” *"°

In the Tribunal’s view, this suggestion implies the recognition that a late application would
cure the breach of Claimant’s obligation to apply for the permit at the start of the operation.
With this in mind, the Tribunal finds that it is not obliged to decide the dispute over the
question of whether the application was made timely.

However, this finding does not imply that Claimant was exempt from submitting an
application with supporting documentation when asked to do so. The Tribunal has found
no evidence that Claimant complied with the respective requests by the Albanian
authorities. The finding equally does not extend to the undisputed fact that no permit was
issued and that the operation did not comply with Albanian’s procedural law.

Having stated that Albanian law was violated by the construction of the tank farm without
the construction site permit and the construction permit as well as the operation of the tank

farm without the exploitation permit, the Tribunal will address Claimant’s assertion that
Respondent is barred from relying on the missing permits.

Claimant asserts that Respondent was obliged to issue the permits after having approved
the project and after having concluded the 20-year lease.

The Tribunal rejects this argument for the simple reason that Respondent’s obligation
could not have arisen before Claimant had properly applied for the permits. Only after this
time would Respondent have been in a position to examine whether all the requirements
were met which, if they had been, would have obliged Respondent to issue the permits.

As developed in this Award, the necessary applications have not been made in the proper
form and substance.

The Tribunal has to determine further whether Respondent is estopped from invoking the
illegality.

In paragraphs 408-419, the Tribunal concluded that the conduct of different Government
bodies cannot be characterized as an implied issuance of the permits.

Claimant alleges that “over the last 12 years” Respondent has consistently acknowledged
the legality of the investment. Further, it quotes a number of declarations from an ex-Prime
Minister, an ex-Minister and ministerial departments that allegedly support estoppel.
Claimant argues that in invoking illegality now, Respondent contradicts prior conduct on
which Claimant can rely in support of its argument.*””

The Tribunal shares the opinion that the principle of estoppel is embedded in international
law. It is a principle where for reasons of material justice a person is hindered from
exercising an existing right. It is apparent that such a consequence must be restricted to
exceptional circumstances. Estoppel may be found when a party demonstrates by its
conduct that it will not exercise a right and a counter-party legitimately relies on this
conduct. Mere inactivity, as opposed to an act, is not enough and is addressed by norms on
statute of limitation.

The Tribunal believes that the required exceptional circumstances are absent in the
relations between the Parties in this case.

Firstly, Claimant’s allegations that “[n]ot only had Government ministers solicited and
authorized the project and entered into the twenty-year leasing contract, for years
afterwards no authority, whether central or municipal doubted the legality of construction

and operation of the tank farm’>"* are not entirely correct. The Tribunal has seen evidence

that Claimant, but not Respondent, solicited Claimant’s investment.

It is also not the case that for years Respondent has not doubted the legality of the
investment. The Tribunal learned from Claimant itself that local authorities started to ask
for building permits in 2001,°” and beginning 2003 the central Government also started to
insist that permits were lacking and asked for efforts to regularize the situation.

Secondly, none of the declarations of the Albanian Government officials contains a
statement that confirms the legality of the construction and the operation of the tank farm.

As to the statement “[t]he Government will also need to identify funds to compensate the
company for moving”, this is part of the summary of an internal discussion between a
World Bank mission in July 2000 where the World Bank delegation made a number of
observations and recommendations that were responded to by a Minister who had taken
office shortly before.**° The Tribunal is uncertain whether the quoted recommendation is
attributable to the Minister or to the World Bank delegation. However, even if it were the
summary of a reflection of the Minister, it does not represent an acknowledgement of
legality with respect to missing construction and exploitation permits.

The statement of the ex-Prime Minister was made on 29 August 2000 in a newspaper
interview, shortly after the temporary stop of the construction and not long after he took
office. It reads: “[t]hese are inherited contract™', they are legal ones, which implies that
the current government [...] cannot avoid the legal and financial responsibility, regarding
the obligation arising to the Albanian state due do non-observation”.**= The statement
refers to the lease contracts concluded with the Greek companies. It is wrong to imply that
the interviewee wanted to express that the Government would abstain from challenging the
illegality of the construction and operation of the tank farm.

The other quotations presented by Claimant deal with the validity of the lease contract and
the temporary trading license.**°

The Tribunal is unable to interpret these statements as the basis for conduct and to qualify
them as exceptional circumstances that would hinder Respondent from exercising its right
to invoke illegality due to the absence of permits.

478. The Tribunal therefore rejects the application of the principle of estoppel to the
circumstances of the dispute.

479. In sum, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant has not built and has not started to operate
the tank farm in accordance with Albanian legislation and that Respondent is not barred
from invoking the resulting illegality.

480. The Tribunal finds, however, that this conclusion is not sufficient to bar its jurisdiction to
hear and decide the dispute based on the general assumption that States do not consent to
the arbitration of disputes relating to illegal investments. The result of such a sweeping and
undifferentiated opinion might contradict the purposes of international conventions for the
protection of investments.

481. In fact, not every type of non-compliance with national legislation bars the protection of an
investment. First, it is evident that there must be an inner link between the illegal act and
the investment itself. legal conduct of the investor will not affect the investment insofar
as it does not relate to its substance or procedural requirements but rather occurs without
any material connection to the investment.***

482. Second, tribunals have circumscribed the concept in a teleological intention in order to
restrict its application. It is in this perspective that they have stated that the illegality must
be “serious”*® or “manifest” °° and that “minor errors” and “a failure to observe the

bureaucratic formalities of the domestic law”**” will not justify the denial of jurisdiction.

483. The Tribunal agrees with the view that not every trivial, minor contravention of the law
should lead to a refusal of jurisdiction. It must strike a balance between two criteria. On the
one hand, neither Claimant nor the Tribunal may presume that the host State waives its
sovereignty and agrees to the arbitration of disputes when the investor made the investment
in violation of its substantive or procedural legislation. On the other hand, States must not
be allowed to abuse the process by scrutinizing the investment post festum with the
intention of rooting out minor or trivial illegalities as a pretext to free themselves of an
obligation. A State must act consistently with its obligations and not resist jurisdiction
because it wants to escape the consequences of its standing agreement to arbitrate.

484. Claimant has argued that Respondent hid behind alleged violations of bureaucratic
formalities and minor errors to escape jurisdiction. Respondent argues that the non-
application and non-issuance of the permits are far from being minor administrative errors.

Respondent’s legal expert Mr. Kallfa explained that the Law on Urban Planning “was
enacted for overriding reasons of public interest and public order, namely to ensure
proper regard for the State’s policies regarding social development, national defense and
environmental protection” **8

Claimant’s legal expert Prof. Dobjani developed his opinion in two steps. In his written
opinion, he described the content of the Law on Urban Planning and expressed that “the
central government (KRRTRSH) had exclusive competence to issue the approval” and once
this approval is given, the approval by the local authority KRT “was a mere formality” °°
Here he does not evaluate the circumstances of the case. He did not clearly state whether
he considered the approval in principle of 6 January 1999 and the lease contract of 2 June
1999 as approvals under the Law on Urban Planning. During his oral statement, however,
he complemented his written opinion and unequivocally opined that they were not.>”?

In addition, when asked whether he agrees “that questions relating to permits and
regulations in construction activities are of importance as opposed to being trivial” and
that the issue “touches upon safety, health and urban questions”, Prof. Dobjani answered
unequivocally, “[y]es, they are important”.**'

The Tribunal has no reason not to accept the legal experts’ opinions. Both versions of the
Law on Urban Planning spell out the social, political and economic importance of those
laws. This is unsurprising and corresponds to urban-planning laws in most countries.

For these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the argument that the non-application for and the
non-issuance of the permits were but minor administrative errors.

However, the Tribunal notes that Respondent has not drawn the consequences that
Albanian law provides. It has not ordered the demolition of the tank farm, which the Law
on Urban Planning allowed it to do, nor has it imposed any sanctions, which the Law on
Control and Regulation of the Construction Works allowed it to impose. Rather,
Respondent has consistently, and in good faith, tried to cooperate with Claimant by
repeatedly requesting and inviting it to submit the applications in the proper form and
accompanied by the necessary documentation as enumerated in the laws.

The Tribunal finds that this conduct has not cut off Claimant’s obligation to obtain the
required permits, which could not be issued without the proper application. It further holds
that Respondent is not estopped from invoking the missing applications and permits

because it consistently insisted that they were missing. Finally, the Tribunal finds that
Respondent did not acknowledge the legality of the construction and operation.

At the same time, Respondent has, by its conduct, declarations and requests, conveyed to
Claimant that it was ready to consider curing the illegalities if Claimant was willing to
regularize the files. Such cooperation between the Parties succeeded for the environmental
permits, but it did not succeed for the construction permits or the exploitation permit.
Claimant never produced valid applications for the former and stopped providing around
2003/2004 documents in support of the application for the latter, as requested by the
authorities.

Under the specific circumstances of the case, the real issue is less one of the seriousness or
triviality of the illegality but, rather, concerns finality. The Tribunal interprets
Respondent’s proposals as indications that it was ready to disregard the illegality for the
past, to suspend it for the present and to repair it for the future. It was ready to enter into a
debate about the legal framework of the investment and not repudiate it as it was.

This is exactly where the arbitral process can make a valuable contribution by ascertaining
the Parties’ positions objectively and neutrally. It is true that a State cannot be expected to
have consented to an arbitral dispute settlement mechanism for investments made in
violation of its legislation. However, it can be expected to accept the jurisdiction of an
arbitral tribunal when, in that State’s own appreciation, the illegality of the investment was
susceptible of being cured, as that State’s legalization offers show. In such circumstances,
the legal significance of the absence of permits is to be determined as a question of merits
— namely whether Respondent’s international responsibility is engaged in the face of
Claimant’s violation of Albanian law — rather than this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

For all these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction to hear the Claimant’s
claims.

MERITS

496. Claimant has asserted the following substantive claims under the BIT and under the ECT:

Albania has violated its duty not to expropriate Claimant’s investment without
compensation as required under Article 4.2 of the BIT and Article 13.1 of the ECT;

Albania has violated its duty to accord Claimant’s investment fair and equitable
treatment as implicitly required by the BIT and explicitly by Article 10.1 of the
ECT by failing to provide a stable and transparent legal framework, to respect
legitimate expectations, to abstain from exerting pressure and by denying justice to
Claimant;

Albania has violated its duty to refrain from unreasonable and discriminatory
measures as required by Article 10.1 of the ECT;

Albania has violated its duty to provide most constant protection and security as
required by Article 10.1 of the ECT.

497. Claimant has based these different claims largely on identical facts. The Tribunal believes,

however, that as each head of claim invokes a specific standard of protection, specific facts
must be shown for each claimed violation. The Tribunal will therefore examine the facts
and arguments separately for each claim.

6.1 Expropriation

498. Article 4.2 of the BIT provides:

Investments by investors of either Contracting Party shall not be expropriated, nationalized or
subjected to any other measure the effects of which would be tantamount to an expropriation
or nationalization in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for the public benefit and
against prompt, adequate and effective compensation.

499. Article 13.1 of the ECT provides:

Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other Contracting Party shall
not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to a measure or measures having effect equivalent
to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as "Expropriation") except where such
Expropriation is:

(a) for a purpose which is in the public interest;

(b) not discriminatory;

(c) carried out under due process of law; and

(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.

6.1.1 Claimant’s position

Claimant contends that Respondent did not directly expropriate its titles and rights but that
the totality of its actions and omissions “from the change of the land use plan in 2000 up to
the refusal to renew the trading license at the end of 2010 amount to an unlawful indirect
and creeping expropriation’. In other words, the aggregate effect of Respondent’s actions
was tantamount to an expropriation and had an effect equivalent to an expropriation.»

Claimant argues that the text of both the BIT and the ECT covers indirect expropriation.
Moreover, arbitral case law and literature confirm that a series of measures which, taken
individually, may not have the effect of an expropriation, may amount to an expropriation
if taken together. According to Claimant, “[i]t is the hallmark of indirect expropriation that
no rights are taken”, as it is “the hallmark of an creeping (sic) expropriation that the
investment which is affected is not taken, but deprived of any value”.*°3

With respect to the concept of indirect expropriation, Claimant relies on the award in
Tecmed v. Mexico where the tribunal found:

To establish whether the Resolution is a measure equivalent to an expropriation [...], it must
be first determined if Claimant, [...] was radically deprived of the economical use and
enjoyment of its investments, as if the rights related thereto — such as the income or benefits
related to the Landfill or to its exploitation — had ceased to exist. In other words, if due to the
actions of Respondent, the assets involved have lost their value or economic use for their
holder ...°"

Claimant further relies on the award in AES v. Hungary where the tribunal agreed with
Tecmed and argued:
For an expropriation to occur, it is necessary for the investor to be deprived, in whole of

significant part, of the property in or effective control of its investment: or for its investment to
be deprived, in whole or significant part, of its value.*?°

Other tribunals have concurred and found that an expropriation can occur although no title
is taken directly. The revocation of a free zone certificate as in Goetz v. Burundi*® or of an

505. Claimant accepts that the State is entitled to act in the public interest and enforce
regulatory measures but argues that these measures must be reasonable, proportionate and
not confiscatory, which was not the case concerning Respondent.*” It quotes Feldman v.
Mexico, where the tribunal held:

The Tribunal notes that the ways in which governmental authorities may force a company out
of business, or significantly reduce the economic benefits of its business, are many. In the
past, confiscatory taxation, denial of access to infrastructure or necessary raw materials,
imposition of unreasonable regulatory regimes, among others, have been considered to be
expropriatory actions.”

506. Claimant further contends that the assertion that the measures are effectively in the general
public interest “is irrelevant [since] [t]he purpose of a measure is less important than its
effect?! It refers to Santa Elena vy. Costa Rica where the tribunal found that “where
property is expropriated, even for environmental purposes [...] the state’s obligation to
pay compensation remains’, as laudable and beneficial as those measures may be?

507. According to Claimant, the principle is all the more applicable since Respondent used the
argument of the protection of public interest as a mere pretext, documented by the fact that
it did not live up to its own measures.‘”?

508. With respect to the concept of creeping expropriation, Claimant relies on Vivendi v.
Argentina IT where the tribunal held that:

[i]t is well-established under international law that even if a single act or omission by a
government may not constitute a violation of an international obligation, several acts taken
together can warrant finding that such obligation has been breached.*™

Claimant also relies on Siemens v. Argentina where the tribunal found:

[bly definition, creeping expropriation refers to a process, to steps that eventually have the
effect of an expropriation. If the process stops before it reaches that point, then expropriation
would not occur. This does not necessarily mean that no adverse effects would have occurred.
Obviously, each step must have an adverse effect but by itself may not be significant or
considered an illegal act. The last step in a creeping expropriation that tilts the balance is
similar to the straw that breaks the camel's back. The preceding straws may not have had a
perceptible effect but are part of the process that led to the break.*”°

Finally, Claimant argues that the process of creeping expropriation can extend over long
periods of time, such as in Santa Elena v. Costa Rica where it stretched over more than 17
years and where the tribunal found:

the period of time involved in the process may vary — from an immediate and comprehensive
taking to one that only gradually and by small steps reaches a condition in which it can be
said that the owner has truly lost all the attributes of ownership. It is clear, however, that a
measure or series of measures can still eventually amount to a taking, though the individual
steps in the process do not formally purport to amount to a taking or toa transfer of title.*%

Claimant relates the following factual allegations to its appreciation of the law.

The first measure that curtailed the profitability of its investment was the enactment of the
new Land Use Plan in June 2000, which would eventually ban petroleum products from the
port of Durres, including the unloading of vessels. Thus Claimant argues that the measure
was unreasonable vis-a-vis Claimant because it came unexpectedly and at a moment when
Claimant was still implementing its investment, in legitimate reliance on the validity of the
20-year lease contract. The contract had created a stable legal basis for its investment,
which the new Land Use Plan destroyed. Mamidoil acted in good faith when it relied on
the stability of the legal framework and constructed the tank farm. Had it known that a new
land use was in preparation, it would not have invested.”

The announcement of a relocation of the tank farm, which came with the new Land Use
Plan, had the effect that the stable legal framework did not exist any longer. Therefore, the
initial investment plan to build and operate COCOs “for which the fuel tanks had been
constructed” had to be reconsidered and then abandoned in 2001/2003.‘

The alternative to contractual gas stations was less profitable, and the lack of regulation as
well as the distortion of the fuel market “made it impossible to earn any profits’.

Nevertheless, Claimant continued to operate its investment expecting that the regulatory
409

framework would improve.
“The final blow” in a series of measures was the closing of the port of Durres for the
discharging of petroleum tankers in 2007, which took effect in 2009. This completed the
indirect and creeping expropriation, and the operation of the tank farm became “completely
uneconomical’. Furthermore, this hindered Mamidoil from refilling the reservoir and
maintaining the security reserve, which were preconditions for renewing its trading
license.*"°

Moreover, according to Claimant, the evidence of the Respondent’s conduct shows that its
claimed pursuit of public interest was but a pretext. In reality, Respondent was avoiding
the payment of contractual penalties in the Petrolifera settlement agreement, and its actions
did not amount to a legitimate measure, and even if they did, were unlawful as they were

without compensation to Claimant.“!!

In sum, the expropriation was discriminatory and lacked due process.*!

Claimant asserts that the measures left the tank farm “without any commercial value apart
from scrap value”, that the shares of the subsidiary “have been deprived of any value” and

that its brand name “suffered heavily in the Albanian market’.“3

6.1.2 Respondent’s position

Respondent disputes Claimant’s arguments and presentation of the facts. Its contentions
are as follows.

The investment in the construction of the tank farm was illegal because it was made
without the necessary permits, the construction was at no moment legalized and
Respondent has never waived the necessity of the permits. For these reasons, the
construction cannot confer any “right” to Claimant capable of expropriation.*" Respondent
summarizes its position as follows:

In sum, in the absence of any “right” or “legitimate expectation” that is able to give rise to a
claim, there simply cannot be a case for expropriation or breach of international law tout court.
As the tribunal in EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador explained, one cannot claim for

something it never had: “for there to have been an expropriation of an investment [...] the
rights affected must exist under the law which creates them.*'*

521.

The tank farm was built in full knowledge of the imminent re-zoning plans. According to
Respondent, Claimant took that risk deliberately, failed to conduct any due diligence and
suffers now the consequences of its own reckless decisions.*"°

522. The only “two valid rights, namely the right to lease a site by virtue of the Lease
Agreement and the temporary right to act as a wholesaler of petroleum subject to the
conditions of its temporary trading license [...] remain unaffected to date”.4""

523. Respondent alleges that Claimant might still exploit the tank farm. Other business
opportunities are available. It could even apply for a new trading license, as did its
competitor Global, which received — as Claimant explicitly recognized — a new trading
permit “without any problems” *'8

524. The requirement to maintain a security reserve could have been complied with in a number

of ways. Claimant could, for instance, have used the tanks exclusively for this purpose, and

it could have rented part of the space to other wholesale dealers.*!”

525. Respondent points to these and other opportunities that remained available after the closing
of port of Durres to petroleum products. If Claimant did not pursue them, it is due to its
own negligence and bad business judgment, which characterizes the investment from the
beginning. The resulting losses were thus not caused by expropriatory acts.*?°

526. Respondent summarizes its opinion on the alleged losses of Claimant’s investment as
follows:

 

In sum, the fact of the matter is that Mamidoil Albanian’s rights under the Lease Agreement, as
well as its rights under the temporary trading license, remained completely intact and
unaffected by the measures adopted by the Government. Notably, both the plot of land, as
well as the tank farm constructed thereon, albeit never approved prior or subsequent to its
construction, remain in the hands of Mamidoil Albanian today, and until its expiration on 16
February 2011, Mamidoil Albanian was entitled to conduct wholesale activities on the basis of
its temporary trading permit.

The same moreover applies to Claimant’s shares in Mamidoil Albanian. Claimant has
retained full ownership, control and use of i ares. Respondent’s measures have not affected
any of Claimant's rights as a shareholder, including its voting right and right to the payment of
dividend. To the extent Claimant claims that its shares have lost their economic value, it
must again be recalled that at the heart of this devaluation are not Respondents acts or
impugned Decision No. 486, but Claimant's fatal misconception that it could force its way into
the market to obtain a dominant market presence, even in the absence of a retail network of
COCO’s. It was thus Claimant’s own reckless business decision that condemned Mamidoil
Albanian to run a largely loss-making wholesale business. In particular, and as confirmed by
Respondent’s Quantum Expert, the operation of a wholesale business without a retail network
in the Albanian market, could in no way have been viable, even under ideal market conditions.
From the moment Claimant decided in 2001 to limit Mamidoil Albanian’s business to the
wholesale of fuel, Mamidoil Albanian’s business was doomed to economic failure.””!

   

 

 

 

Even if rights had been taken, it would not be an expropriation because it was a bona fide
exercise of regulatory power aimed at the general welfare and implementing the long-
standing and publicly-known decision to close the port of Durres for “overriding socio-
economic and public safety considerations” “7?

Respondent asserts that it is established in international law that States are not liable to pay
compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their regulatory powers,
they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner bona fide regulations that are aimed at the
general welfare.

Respondent quotes from an UNCTAD report on expropriation, which insists that “the
police powers must be understood as encompassing a State’s full regulatory dimension”
and includes “[...] implementing control regimes through licences, concessions, registers,

permits and authorizations; protecting the environment and public health; regulating the

- . o> 423
conduct of corporations; and others’ A

Respondent also relies on international arbitral jurisprudence including the partial award in
Saluka v. Czech Republic where the tribunal found:

Article 5 of the Treaty in the present case is drafted very broadly and does not contain any
exception for the exercise of regulatory power. However, in using the concept of deprivation,
Article 5 imports into the Treaty the customary international law notion that a deprivation
can be justified if it results from the exercise of regulatory actions aimed at the maintenance
of public order. In interpreting a treaty, account has to be taken of “any relevant rules of
international law applicable in the relations between the parties” — a requirement which the
International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) has held includes relevant rules of general customary
international law.*™*

It also refers to Feldman v. Mexico where the tribunal found:

At the same time, governments must be free to act in the broader public interest through
protection of the environment, new or modified tax regimes, the granting or withdrawal of
government subsidies, reductions or increases in tariff levels, imposition of zoning restrictions
and the like. Reasonable governmental regulation of this type cannot be achieved if any
business that is adversely af fected may seek compensation, and it is safe to say that customary
international law recognizes this.

 

 

Respondent alleges that the prohibition on processing tankers in the port of Durres from
2009 was the result of a consistent economic, environmental and social policy and a
“lawful necessity” which had its base and roots in the Land Use Plan enacted in 2000, in
close co-operation and under the control of international expert advice and public
international financing. The experts had warned that the transformation of the port of
Durres was “the key for economic survival”?

Being part of the implementation of its long-term transport sector strategy, and as the
modernization of the port system was necessary and in the overriding public interest, it is
“crystal clear’ that the ban of fuel vessels from Durres was not a mere pretext.*?”

Respondent accepts, consistent with Chemtura v. Canada, that a State must act “in a non-
discriminatory manner’® but contends that the prohibition on processing tankers in
Durres port concerned all companies “without making any distinction between the
nationality of the companies”. 429

Finally, Respondent asserts that even if the Tribunal found that Albania had expropriated,
such expropriation would still be lawful because it served a public purpose and was non-
discriminatory. The fact that no compensation was offered does not change the lawfulness
of the act. It could “merely provide the basis for a claim to compensation,” which is
doubtful in this case given Claimant’s bad faith investment.**°

6.1.3 The Determination of the Tribunal

At the outset, the Tribunal must identify the facts that could serve to ground a claim for
expropriation.

Claimant has essentially asserted that the following measures amounted to an indirect and
creeping expropriation:

- The regulatory changes of 2000, embedded in the new Land Use Plan, of which it
was “not aware” before it was enacted;**!

- The “initial pressure to relocate Mamidoil Albania’s newly built tank farm in
2000”;

- The Decree dated 25 July 2007 prohibiting the discharge of fuel tankers in the port
of Durres, which entered into effect in July 2009, whose public policy and welfare
justifications Claimant considers to be a pretext;**3

- The “refusal to renew the trading license at the end of 2010".4

Before determining whether these facts, individually or taken together, would amount to an
expropriation, the Tribunal will have to determine whether the facts are correctly
presented. This is all the more important since Claimant presents the same facts — in
addition to others — to assert the further claims.

The Tribunal has carefully studied the file and listened to the witnesses examined during
the hearing, and has come to the following conclusions.

With respect to the enactment of the Land Use Plan in 2000, two of Claimant’s witnesses,
both senior members of its management and members of the Mamidakis family, recall to
have taken note of warning letters in or around March/April 2000. That is two to three
months before the enactment of the plan.

Claimant has further acknowledged that on 17 November 1999, Mamidoil Albanian
received and had knowledge of a letter written by the port authority in November 1999
which called for the suspension of the construction of the tank farm until recommendations
and decisions as to the future of the port were issued. The letter refers to verbal warnings
expressed in October 1999. The general director of Mamidoil Albanian was a member of
Claimant’s senior management, and the deputy general director was the local partner and
minority shareholder. The deputy general director responded to the letter on 7 December
1999.

The Tribunal disagrees with Claimant’s contention that three members of its senior
management have personally not read the letter (and subsequent letters and memoranda to
the same effect) and were therefore not aware of its content. The letter and the information
arrived in Claimant’s sphere of business, and the deputy general director reacted to it. The

546.

receipt of the letter and the positive knowledge by the senior management of Mamidoil
Albanian are attributed to Claimant. The Albanian authorities were entitled to expect that
Claimant would take note of the contents. Supposed deficiencies of internal
communication are no excuse for a lack of knowledge.

Therefore, the Tribunal holds that Claimant was aware from October/November 1999 that
regulatory changes and a transformation for the port of Durres were imminent. It is
uncontested that at that time the construction of the tank farm had not yet begun, except for
the cleaning of the site and the building of a fence around it.

With respect to the alleged initial pressure exercised by the Albanian authorities to relocate
the tank farm, the Tribunal notes that Respondent’s order of 17 July 2000 to interrupt the
construction may have been perceived as pressure. However, the order was the starting
point to negotiations between the Parties, actively supported by the Greek government,
which resulted in the permission to complete the construction and in the issuance of a
wholesale trading license. The Tribunal does not see how the process of taking, negotiating
and revising a position can be qualified as pressure to relocate when as its result Claimant
was authorized to complete the construction and operate the tank farm in Durres for
approximately eight years.

With respect to the prohibition to discharge fuel tankers from July 2009, the Tribunal is not
convinced by Claimant’s appreciation and evidence to the effect that Respondent had
abandoned its Land Use Plan for Durres and used environmental, social and other public
policy considerations as a pretext while in reality it was only trying to escape from
penalties under a settlement agreement with its competitor Petrolifera. Claimant based this
assumption on the facts that the dates of the decree and the final prohibition coincide
roughly with the dates of the settlement agreement, that Respondent had no objection to the
operation of the tank farm until the end of the term of the lease, and that Respondent re-
opened the port of Shengjin although it had also be closed for so-called policy reasons.

The Tribunal notes that the closure of the port of Durres for petroleum vessels not only
more or less coincides with the Petrolifera settlement but also with the opening of Porto
Romano as the major port for petroleum products. The port of Durres was closed precisely
when Porto Romano opened. To the Tribunal’s mind, the parallel marks the completion of
a long process of restructuring the Albanian maritime transport sector. It had been initiated
by the IDA-credit and project and the resulting study by Louis Berger Inc. urging a new
outlook for Durres. Other international public institutions such as the European
Commission and the OPEC-Fund had contributed to the execution of the plan. One of its
components was the creation of modern infrastructure in Porto Romano. It is well
documented by reports established by these institutions that Albania had pursued this
policy over the years. It is equally documented that Respondent has repeatedly offered

102

547.

548.

549.

550.

551.

552.

preferential sites in Porto Romano to Claimant and the other companies operating in
Durres.

The process had taken longer than initially envisaged, but that comes as no surprise. It is
consistent policy to execute a plan of reorientation of petroleum-carrying vessels once the
conditions are met and the infrastructure is in place. That is what happened. Porto Romano
is now the central port for petroleum products.

It was part of the policy as formulated in the course of the Berger study that no new
investment for the operation of tank farms would be allowed in Durres. The Greek
investors had obtained exceptional authorizations after negotiations assisted by the Greek
government. During these years, the Greek companies enjoyed a privileged position over
other international competitors such as Petrolifera, which were not allowed to profit from
the existing infrastructure and advantageous location of Durres. It is understandable that
these investors tried to push Albania to apply the Land Use Plan for Durres
indiscriminately to all importers, including the Greek companies.

To the Tribunal’s mind, Respondent’s assurances in the settlement agreement reiterate
foremost its general policy objectives, which had led it to ban Petrolifera from the port of
Durres. Respondent promised to apply these objectives to all companies. That is not more
than a confirmation of the pursuit of its general policy, as announced from the first
articulation of the new Land Use Plan in discussions in various working groups and in a
further public announcement by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Energy, dated 6
October 2006.

The measure was not discriminatory against Claimant because it concerned all companies
operating in Durres, and it is not discriminatory against Greek companies as a specific
national group since the Greek companies had been the only ones allowed to operate in
Durres as an exception after the intervention by the Greek government.

The Tribunal is not fully informed as to the reasons Respondent changed its plans with
respect to the port of Shengjin. However, the policy objectives with respect to one port do
not reflect on the soundness of policy objectives for the port of Durres, which Albania and
its international partners had developed in a professional manner.

Finally, Respondent’s assurances that it would honor the 20-year lease and not prohibit the
use of the tank farm until the expiration of its term does not discredit its decision to close
the port for petroleum vessels. It is the acknowledgment of the validity of a contract, which
was executed before the change of policy and which Respondent is ready to perform to its
term despite its lack of conformity with the new transport sector policy. It is evident to the
Tribunal that Respondent would have also preferred to terminate the lease and close the
tank farm in pursuit of its general policy. The fact that it decided not to go ahead with the

103

557.

558.

435

complete implementation of this policy and to honour its contractual obligations instead
cannot be held against it.

However, the lease does not encompass a guarantee for vessels to unload petroleum
products into the tank farm. This led to the less-than-optimal temporary situation that the
implementation of the new policy for Durres had to be split into two phases, the first
concerning the use of the port facilities in a strict sense, and the second concerning the site
within the port area.

For all these reasons, the Tribunal has not seen any evidence supporting the allegation that
Respondent had abandoned its Land Use Plan for Durres and used public policy
considerations as a mere pretext.

With respect to the non-renewal of the trading license, the Tribunal notes that Claimant’s
presentation has evolved over time. Originally, it asserted that one of the measures
contributing to the process of creeping expropriation was the “refusal” to grant the
renewal.**> At a later stage, it asserted that it “did not start a second application for a
trading license” because it could no longer meet the reserve requirements.**° Claimant
accepted that it would have received the license had it applied for it.”

The Tribunal does not see how the non-application for a license by Claimant might qualify
as a measure of creeping expropriation by Respondent.

As to the alleged impossibility to maintain a security reserve, the Tribunal disagrees with
Claimant’s contention. It is evident that the tank farm was there and fully usable for
Claimant’s purpose of depositing reserves. The fact that the reservoirs could no longer be
serviced from the sea has no bearing on their storage capacity. The maintenance of the
reserve stock does not depend on the constant “possibility to refill the tanks”, as contended
by Claimant*** but on the — uncontested — right to fill them once and for all with the
quantity required for the reserve. The Tribunal does not find a causal connection between
the non-application for the new trading permit and the storage capacity of the tank farm.

In light of these findings, the Tribunal must determine whether any or a combination of the
following amount to an expropriation of Claimant’s investment:

- the enactment of the new zoning plan for the port of Durres in June 2000, which
had been announced to Claimant as imminent at the latest in November 1999;

Cl. Mem., para. 212.

- the order of a temporary suspension of construction works in July 2000 which was
lifted in December 2000 by an authorization to complete the construction and to
start operations;

the issuance of a wholesale trading license in February 2001, valid until it expired
in February 2011, after Claimant had chosen not to apply for its renewal; and/or

the prohibition to land and discharge petroleum products from vessels in the port of
Durres, decreed in July 2007 and effective from July 2009.

559. Two preliminary remarks are appropriate. Claimant asserts that the measures destroyed the

560.

561.

“necessary stable legal framework for further investment’ as well as the initial expectation
that it could operate the tank farm profitably until the expiration of the term of the lease.*”
Claimant further contends that it does not matter that the measures have not directly taken
any of its property rights because they have deprived them of all value because “without
the possibility to discharge tankers in the port the operation of the tank farm was
completely uneconomical” .“°

Firstly, the Tribunal emphasizes that there are distinct standards of protection, with distinct
requirements, under the BIT and the ECT. Damage caused by a violation of legitimate
expectations, or by arbitrary measures, or by a destabilization of the legal framework, or by
a lack of regulation and distortions of the fuel market may give rise to claims under either
of the standards of fair and equitable treatment, or the the prohibition of discriminatory
measures, or the most constant protection and security. However, they are not at the same
time per se indicative of an illegal expropriation.

In order to be capable of being considered expropriatory — even indirectly — the
consequences for the property must be substantiated in accordance with the specificities of
the claim for expropriation. The simple allegation that (the lack of) policy measures “made
it impossible to earn any profits which could be distributed to Claimant” does not suffice
to elevate the description of conduct into the sphere of a loss of the investment. This is all
the more so when, as here, Claimant did earn profit before the port of Durres was closed,**!
i.e. before the last of the alleged measures in the line of the alleged creeping expropriation
was taken. The allegation that the lack of regulation and the distortion of the fuel market
“made it impossible to earn any profits” is not supported by the evidence provided by
Claimant.

567.

Secondly, and more importantly under the circumstances of the present dispute, the BIT
and the ECT expressly provide that not only the direct taking of property rights may cause
expropriation but also measures tantamount to or having the effect equivalent to an
expropriation. In the Tribunal’s view, this language encompasses indirect expropriation,
which can be the consequence of one measure or compound measures. The Parties do not
contest this principle.

That being said, the Tribunal has to determine whether the effect of the compounded
measures amounted to an expropriation. The term “expropriation” is specific and not a
synonym for damages that can be sought for the breach of other standards such as “fair and
equitable treatment’, which require distinct conditions for a breach to be established.

In its affirmative presentation of the legal standard, Claimant relies on a number of awards,
summarized above in the “Claimant’s Position”, where international arbitral tribunals held
that measures that deprive an investor completely or in part of its property, or of its
economic enjoyment, must be qualified as an expropriation. The termination of a free zone
certificate, the revocation of a license, and unreasonable regulatory regimes are quoted as
examples.

The Tribunal has read the cited awards carefully. Although not bound by them since
binding precedent is alien to international investment arbitration, the Tribunal certainly
respects and seeks guidance from legal opinions and interpretation expressed by learned
colleagues.

The Tribunal holds that the decisive criterion for most tribunals that find expropriation is
not the fact of having incurred a damage and/or the loss of value as such, but the finding —
as stated in Santa Elena v. Costa Rica — “that the owner has truly lost all the attributes of
ownership” .*? As the tribunal in E/ Paso v. Argentina expressed in its award, which has
been upheld in annulment proceedings, “at least one of the essential components of the

property rights must have disappeared for an expropriation to have occurred”.

The concept is clearly applied in AES v. Hungary. Claimant correctly quotes the tribunal in
that case as stating that “it is necessary for the investor to be deprived, in whole of
significant part, of the property in or effective control of its investment: or for its
investment to be deprived, in whole or significant part, of its value”.““* However, the

tribunal goes on to state that “the amendment of the 2001 Electricity Act and the issuance
of the Price Decrees did not interfere with the ownership or use of Claimant’s property.
Claimant retained at all times the control of the AES Tisza I plant, thus there was no
deprivation of Claimant’s ownership or control of their investment”.** On this basis, the
tribunal held that no expropriation had taken place.

The same rationale is found in the careful analysis of Tecmed, Goetz and Middle East
Cement carried out by the tribunal in E/ Paso v. Argentina.“ It appears that in all of these
awards, emphasis was laid not only on the fact that the investment lost value and the
investor was deprived of benefits, but also that these effects resulted from a loss of one or
several attributes of ownership.

The Tribunal concurs with this opinion. In its literal translation, expropriation describes a
specific effect on property itself and not a damage inflicted to property. The effect can be a
direct taking as it can be an indirect deprivation of one or several of its essential
characteristics. These are traditionally defined by its use and enjoyment, control and
possession, and disposal and alienation. If one of these attributes is affected, the resulting
loss of value and/or benefit may lead to a claim for expropriation.

The definition of expropriation has developed over time and gone beyond the formalistic
concentration on title. It encompasses the substance of property and protects the property
even if title is not taken. However, a further extension into the sphere of damages, loss of
value and profitability, without regard to the substance and attributes of property, would
deprive the claim of its distinct nature and amalgamate it with other claims. Thus, a mere
loss of value or a loss of benefits that is connected to and caused by the dissolution of at
least one attribute of property, does not constitute indirect expropriation. The contrary
approach would not only contradict the literal meaning of the term “ex-propriation”, but
would also be inconsistent with the clear intention of State parties when they entered into
the BIT and the ECT and provided for separate standards of protection.

In sum, illegal conduct will not give rise to a claim for expropriation (though it may ground
a different claim) if the the substance and attributes of property are left intact. Conversely,
legal conduct may be expropriatory if the essence of property is touched, as set out above,
and no compensation is paid.

The Tribunal agrees therefore with the tribunal in E/ Paso v. Argentina when it held:

September 2010, para. 14.3.2.

Regulations that reduce the profitability of an investment but do not shut it down completely
and leave the investor in control will generally not qualify as indirect expropriations even
though they might give rise to liability of other standards of treatment, such as national
treatment or fair and equitable treatment.

 

In conclusion, the Tribunal, consistently with mainstream case-law, finds for an expropriation to
exist, the investor should be substantially deprived not only of the benefits, but also of the use of
its investment. A mere loss of value, which is not the result of an interference with the control
or use of the investment, is not an indirect expropriation.”

  

In applying these findings to the circumstances of the dispute, the Tribunal finds that
Respondent has not expropriated Claimant’s investment.

With the first incriminated measure — the enactment in June 2000 of the new Land Use
Plan for the port of Durres — Respondent has executed part of an overall transport sector
policy, which had been carefully prepared, with international professional and financial
assistance, to modernize the country’s infrastructure and to enforce environmental, social
and economic policy goals. Claimant was aware of this when it started to construct the tank
farm.

With the second incriminated measure — the order to suspend the construction a month
after the enactment of the new Land Use Plan and the ensuing authorization to complete it
as well as the issuance of the trading permit — Respondent has accommodated Claimant’s
request and laid the basis for a profitable operation under the circumstances, which
Claimant pursued until after the closure of the port for petroleum vessels.

The operation was so successful that Claimant decided to buy out the minority shareholder
in 2006 for a price of 1 Million USD and prepare its listing at the Alternative Investment
Market (AIM) in London.*“* When Claimant first suspended and later abandoned its plans
to create a network of COCOs in 2001 and 2003, this decision was not motivated by the
incriminated measures but “in light of the unorthodox formation of the local market in
Albania, contrary to our initial estimate, as well as the uncertain investment environment
that this creates”.“” This statement documents that at the time and until the closure of the
port of Durres, Claimant was far from thinking that the regulatory environment made it
impossible to earn any profit. It recognized difficulties, which led it to change its strategy.
This is different from a loss of any of the attributes of property.

Therefore, the Tribunal does not qualify these first measures as part of a process of
creeping expropriation but as an appropriate enactment of public policy and a subsequent

accommodation of Claimant’s interests. This view seems to be shared by Claimant’s
contemporaneous appreciation.

The third incriminated measure — the closure of the port for petroleum vessels — led,
indeed, to a loss of value of Claimant’s investment and a dramatic loss of benefits. It was,
however, not the “straw that broke the camel’s back” but part of the implementation of
Respondent’s public policy. The Tribunal is convinced that, contrary to its allegations,
Claimant was aware of this future evolution when it started to spend money on the tank
farm, that Respondent had never abandoned the policy, and that the continued motivation
for the re-orientation and re-zoning of the port of Durres was this public policy and not the
Petrolifera settlement agreement, which might have reinforced the motivation but did not
create it.

The result of the measure was not Claimant’s loss of any of the attributes of its property
over the investment. Claimant remained entitled to continue to use, possess, control, and
dispose of the property. It is not the Tribunal’s task to evaluate business opportunities but
to determine whether the dramatic losses of benefit are caused by the loss of one or all
elements which constitute the essence of property. The Tribunal holds that this is not the
case and that Respondent neither directly nor indirectly expropriated Claimant’s
investment.

The Tribunal therefore rejects the claim for expropriation.

6.2 Fair and Equitable Treatment

Article 10.1 of the ECT provides:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and
create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other
Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area.

The BIT does not explicitly provide the standard of fair and equitable treatment. Claimant
asserts that Respondent has conceded in the context of another investment treaty claim that
the standard applies irrespective of a MFN-clause and contends that this is its general
practice.**° Respondent has not expressly denied the assertion. It has answered in
substance that Claimant had no legitimate expectations”! and that no denial of justice
occurred under Article 10.1 of the ECT.

583. Based on the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal hereinafter determines whether Respondent
violated the standard of fair and equitable treatment as formulated in Article 10.1 ECT.

584. Claimant asserts that Albania:

- has failed to provide a stable and transparent legal framework;

has failed to respect legitimate expectations;
- has failed to abstain from exerting pressure; and

- has denied Claimant justice.
585. The Tribunal will follow the structure of Claimant’s presentation in its analysis.

6.2.1 The provision of a stable and transparent legal framework

 

Claimant’s position

586. In its Memorial and in its opening statement during the evidentiary hearing, Claimant
asserted that “Albania failed to provide a transparent and stable legal framework to
Mamidoil Albanian’.

587. In its development of the legal standard, Claimant relies on Tecmed v. Mexico where the
Tribunal stated:

The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity
and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know
beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the
goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its
investment and comply with such regulations [...] The foreign investor also expects the ho:
State to act consistently, ie. without arbitrarily revoking any pre-existing decisions or permi
issued by the State that were relied upon by the investor to assume its commitments as well as
to plan and launch its commercial and business activities.**”

 
 

      

 

   

588. Claimant is aware of the criticism of the Tecmed award and adds that the principle to
provide a stable and transparent legal framework and administrative process is undisputed.
This includes the necessary respect for due process, procedural propriety and the obligation

In this respect, Claimant quotes Waste Management v. Mexico, where the tribunal held:

[T]he minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct
attributable to the State and harmful to Claimant if the conduct attributable to the State and
harmful to Claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic and
exposes Claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to
an outcome which offends judicial propriety— as might be the case with a manifest failure
of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and
candour in an administrative process.**

 

590.

S

Claimant alleges that neither Respondent’s legal framework nor its administrative
application fulfilled the requirements of transparency and stability. It contends that “/e]ven
for a country in transition, the legal framework was exceptionably unstable, unclear and
contradictory” °° In particular, Respondent breached its obligation:

- When it did not inform Claimant about possible plans for the port of Durres, which
started to emerge with the conclusion of the contract with the international
consultant under the IDA credit in December 1998, i.e. before the approval of the
investment plan of 6 January 1999 and the execution of the lease contract in June
1999, and which finally led to the Land Use Plan of June 2000. “Claimant would
not have entered into the Lease Contract — through its subsidiary — had Respondent
acted openly and transparently about its future plan. No reasonable businessman

invests several million USD into a project the legal future of which is uncertain” ;°°

When it reduced the minimum storage capacity in 2002 which opened the market
for “floods of competitors” that were no longer under the obligation to invest
millions in a tank farm, and re-increased it in 2008, shortly before Claimant’s
subsidiary stopped its business;**”

- When it decided “to completely and finally shut down the port of Durres” without
ever having ordered Claimant to relocate the tank farm or specified the conditions
of relocation, although the trading permit was limited for that reason; **

When it did not specify what permits would be needed and what would be their
requirements.**?

6.2.1.2 Respondent’s position

591. Respondent refutes Claimant’s arguments and contends as follows.

592. Respondent states that “[i]f is an uncontroversial and well established principle of
international law that States are not liable to pay compensation for bona fide, non-
discriminatory measures that are taken in the interest of the general welfare”. No State can
be prevented from adjusting the body of its laws and regulations, institutions and
infrastructure to meet evolving economic, political and social conditions and necessities, as
long as the measures are not arbitrary or discriminatory.*°

593. Respondent relies on Saluka v. Czech Republic, where the tribunal held:

It is now established in international law that States are not liable to pay compensation to a
foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their regulatory powers, they adopt in a non-
discriminatory manner bona fide regulations that are aimed at the general welfare.“

594. Respondent argues that if Claimant had wanted to be protected against such changes, it
could have negotiated for and concluded stabilization clauses. It failed to do so and must
bear the consequences. This corresponds to the findings in Parkerings v. Lithuania, where
the tribunal had held, in light of the uncertainties after the collapse of the communist
system:

In 1998, at the time of the Agreement, the political environment in Lithuania was characteristic
of a country in transition from its past being part of the Soviet Union to candidate for the
European Union membership. Thus, legislative changes, far from being unpredictable, were in
fact to be regarded as likely. As any businessman would, Claimant was aware of the risk that
changes of laws would probably occur after the conclusion of the Agreement. The
circumstances surrounding the decision to invest in Lithuania were certainly not an indication
of stability of the legal environment. Therefore, in such a situation, no expectation that the
laws would remain unchanged was legitimate.

By deciding to invest notwithstanding this possible instability, Claimant took the business risk
to be faced with changes of laws possibly or even likely to be detrimental to its investment.
Claimant could (and with hindsight should) have sousit to protect its legitimate expectations
by i into the clause or some other
provision protecting it against unexpected and unweleome changes.*?

 

 

595. Respondent contends that it was obvious that profound regulatory and infrastructural
changes were imminent and unavoidable in Albania during the period of transition, not
least in the transport sector prominently including the orientation and organization of the

seaports. The changes were indispensable for the sustainable economic development of
Albania. They were crucial to overcome the country’s previous isolation, facilitate its
integration into the international market and trading system, implement sound
environmental policy, and introduce safety standards for the ports’ dilapidated
infrastructure.“

596. Claimant not only must have been aware of the imminent reorientation of the port of

Durres but was also explicitly informed along these lines before it started to implement its
investment.**

597. Respondent never made any representation that Claimant would be authorized to use the

port of Durres for discharging vessels carrying petroleum products for the totality of the
term of the lease contract but, on the contrary, informed Claimant before its investment

that this would not be the case.*®

6.2.1.3 The Determination of the Tribunal

598. Claimant has categorized possible breaches of the fair and equitable treatment standard in

four classes of cases, including the obligation to provide a stable and transparent legal
framework and administrative process, both figuring in Article 10.1 of the ECT. The
further classifications concern legitimate expectations, undue pressure and the denial of
justice.

599. The classes of cases have developed in reaction to the fact that the terms “fair” and

“equitable” are generic and vague. They offer no straightforward guidance to their
application and must be interpreted to fit the circumstances of each particular dispute. It
makes sense to classify them in this way since it seems evident that a lack of stability and
transparency of the legal framework, the frustration of legitimate expectations, the exercise
of undue pressure or a denial of justice may be considered unfair and unequitable. Still, it
is important to keep in mind that the classification does not exonerate the Tribunal from its
duty to determine whether, for instance, a given instability is at the same time unfair and
unequitable.

600. Some authors have argued that the vagueness of the terms is not an inconvenience but, on

The irony is that the substantial interpretative uncertainty inherent in the meaning of treatment
that is unfair and unreasonable may well be one of the reasons for its successful adoption.“

Be that as it may, the Tribunal agrees with the ad hoc committee in the MTD v. Chile
annulment decision that “the vagueness inherent in such treaty standards such as ‘fair and
equitable treatment’ [should not] allow international tribunals to second-guess” 4°"

Rather, the Tribunal is bound to give meaning to the vague terms using the guidance
provided in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969.
Accordingly, it will interpret the terms “in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms in their context and in light of its object and purpose”.
(Article 31.1). However, it would widen the criteria of interpretation if it found that this
approach would lead to “manifestly absurd or unreasonable” results (Article 32 (b)).

The Tribunal has looked for and found assistance in awards and decisions that the Parties
have submitted. However, this assistance is not only limited by the fact that international
arbitral tribunals are under no obligation to rely on precedents, but also by the lack of a
jurisprudence constante.

Tribunals have tried to give meaning to the terms by circumscribing them with other terms
such as ‘just’, ‘even-handed’, ‘unbiased’, ‘legitimate’, ‘idiosyncratic’, ‘a manifest failure
of natural justice in judicial proceedings’ and a disregard of ‘procedural propriety’ .“°*
Laudable as these efforts are, they add only limited precision and concretization. They seek
to refine abstract concepts, although — as correctly stated in Lemire v. Ukraine — “[t]he
evaluation of the State’s action cannot be performed in the abstract” *

It is therefore not surprising that tribunals have sought to specify the meaning by trying to
find inspiration in the purpose and objective of the treaties. One of the often-quoted
statements is the Tecmed standard as presented by Claimant in paragraph 587 and as
applied by MTD v. Chile.“ The tribunal in that case arrived at that statement in assessing
the purpose of investment protection treaties to promote and protect international
investments. It found that the purpose leads to an obligation of the States to have their

policy and conduct guided by a proactive approach to protection and promotion of the
investor and its investment.

607. As recognized by Claimant, the Tecmed and MTD approach has come under criticism. In
the MTD annulment decision, the ad-hoc Committee found:

According to Respondent, “the Tecmed programme for good governance” is extreme and does
not reflect international law. [...]The Committee can appreciate some aspects of these
criticisms. For example the TECMED Tribunal’s apparent reliance on the foreign investor's
expectations as the source of the host State’s obligations [...] is questionable. The obligations of
the host State towards foreign investors derive from the terms of the applicable investment
treaty and not from any set of expectations investors may have or claim to have. A tribunal
which sought to generate from such expectations a set of rights different from those contained in
or enforceable under the BIT might well exceed its powers, and if the difference were material
might do so manifestly.*”!

608. In Lemire v. Ukraine, the tribunal insisted that “[t]he evaluation of the State’s action

cannot be performed [...] only with a view of protecting the investors rights”.*”

609. In Saluka v. Czech Republic, the tribunal found as follows:

The protection of foreign investments is not the sole aim of the Treaty, but rather a necessary
element alongside the overall aim of encouraging foreign investment and extending and
intensifying the parties’ economic relations. That in turn calls for a balanced approach to the
interpretation of the Treaty’s substantive provisions for the protection of investments, since an
interpretation which exaggerates the protection to be accorded to foreign investments may serve
to dissuade States from admitting foreign investments and so undermine the overall aim of
extending and intensifying the parties’ mutual economic relations.

 

 

Seen in this light, the “fair and equitable treatment” standard prescribed in the Treaty should
therefore be understood to be treatment which, if not proactively stimulating the inflow of
foreign investment capital, does at least not deter foreign capital by providing disincentives to
foreign investors.*”*

610. In a first step to its assessment of the fair and equitable standard, and in light of the
controversial debate among tribunals, the Tribunal affirms that the vagueness of the terms
does not entitle tribunals to create a new standard of international law in disregard of the
terms of the applicable treaties, generic as they may be.

61

The interpretation is guided by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and starts
with the ordinary meaning of the terms of a given treaty, before a tribunal considers their
context and the object and purpose of the treaty. Generally speaking, investment treaties

aim at the stimulation of cross-border investment in order to foster economic relations
between the treaty partners and economic development in the partner countries.

The Tribunal finds it helpful to stress that the standard broadly applies to investments that
are made in the territory of the host State. The standard creates the obligation under
international law to exercise sovereign power in a way which is not atypical, surprising or
specific to the treatment of foreign investors. In fact, the policy of the modern State
encompasses a general responsibility to provide long-term physical and _ social
infrastructure such as public transport, including sustainable port facilities, in the general
interest, as well as to create and maintain public services and a judiciary that does not deny
justice.

The standard is thereby oriented to predictability of the legal system and to due process.
Modern history in general and recent Albanian economic history in particular demonstrate
that both inadequate over-regulation and under-regulation may lead to crises that hinder
economic development and the creation of common wealth.

Policy in the general interest has to take the variety of social and economic interests into
account, so that individual interests can be safely pursued. It is in this perspective that the
Tribunal subscribes to findings in arbitral awards according to which the obligations of
States under investment protection treaties cannot be appraised with only a view to the
protection of foreign investors’ rights. The fair and equitable standard brings foreign
investors into the normative sphere of rational policy in the general interest. It is not meant
to favor the investors’ interests over other economic and social interests. In fact, a one-
sided policy of favoring one social group over another may have the opposite effect than
the one intended. An exclusive focus on the protection of foreign investment would entail
the dangers, as stated by Saluka, that States would be dissuaded from protecting foreign
investment and, at the same time, access to public goods and services would be impeded.
Both may be detrimental for foreign investors in the long run.

The international legal standard of fair and equitable treatment guarantees the investors’
even-handed access to a State’s public services and infrastructure, maintained in the
general interest. Sustainability through stability and transparency are part of these services
in a broad sense.

These general findings lead the Tribunal to another criterion for the assessment of a stable
and transparent legal framework as part of the fair and equitable standard.

Economic, social, environmental and legal circumstances and problems are by their nature
dynamic and bound to constant change. It is indispensable for successful public
infrastructure and public services to exist that they are adaptable to these changes.
Accordingly, State policy must be able to evolve in order to guarantee adequate

116

infrastructure and services in time and thereby the fair and equitable treatment of
investments. The legal framework makes no exception.

618. The Tribunal is reassured of its view by findings of other arbitral tribunals. Claimant has
introduced AES v. Hungary into the proceedings where the tribunal found:

The stable conditions that the ECT mentions relate to the framework within which the
investment takes place. Nevertheless, it is not a stability clause. A legal framework is by
definition subject to change as it adapts to new circumstances day by day and a state has the
sovereign right to exercise its powers which include legislative acts.

Therefore, to determine the scope of the stable conditions that a state has to encourage and
create is a complex task given that it will always depend on the specific circumstances that
surrounds the investor’s decision to invest and the measures taken by the state in the public
interest.

In this case, however, the Tribunal observes that no specific commitments were made by
Hungary that could limit its sovereign right to change its law (such as a stability clause) or that

could legitimately have made the investor believe that no change in the law would occur.

[

 

In these circumstances, absent a specific commitment from Hungary that it would not
reintroduce administrative pricing during the term of the 2001 PPA, Claimants cannot properly
rely on an alleged breach of Hungary’s Treaty obligation to provide a stable legal environment
[...]. This is because any reasonable informed business person or investor knows that laws can
evolve in accordance with the perceived political or policy dictates of the time.**

  

619. Ina similar vein, the tribunal in Lemire v. Ukraine stated that the State’s obligation to offer
a stable and predictable legal framework must be balanced against other legally relevant
interests such “as the State’s sovereign right to pass legislation and to adopt decisions for
the protection of its public interests, especially if they do not provoke a disproportionate
impact on foreign investors”.*” In Saluka v. Czech Republic, the tribunal affirmed:

No investor may reasonably expect that the circumstances prevailing at the time the investment
is made remain totally unchanged. In order to determine whether frustration of the foreign
investor’s expectations was justified and reasonable, the host State’s legitimate right
subsequently to regulate domestic matters in the public interest must be taken into consideration
as well.”

620. The necessity of balancing is clearly expressed in legal literature:

The interpretation of fair and equitable treatment must take into account legitimate public
interests in regulating investments to achieve national objectives and the enforcement of laws.

At the same time, it must be recognized that the express purpose of IIA’s is to promote and
protect investments and that fair and equitable treatment must be read in that context.*””

621. It is in this sense that even when legislative changes seem legitimate, they must not have
the character of a continuous oscillation and unpredictability.4”*

622. Before turning to a balanced application of the standard to the circumstances of the case,
the Tribunal needs to address two more criteria, which are important for its general
assessment.

623. The first criterion concerns the question of whether the specific situation of Albania is of
relevance for the interpretation of the fair and equitable standard in general and for the
obligation to provide a stable and transparent legal framework in particular. The question
arose in Parkerings v. Lithuania where the tribunal held:

In the view of the Tribunal, Claimant [...] was without doubt aware that the business
environment [...] were not certain. In fact, it would have been foolish for a foreign investor in
Lithuania to believe, at that time, that it would proceeding on stable legal ground, as
considerable changes in the Lithuanian political regime and economy were undergoing.

5

 

[

In principle, an investor has a right to a certain stability and predictability of the legal
environment. The investor will have a right of protection of its legitimate expectations provided
it exercised due diligence and that its legitimate expectations were reasonable in light of the
circumstances. Consequently, an investor must anticipate that the circumstances could change,
and thus structure its investment to adapt to the potential changes of legal environment.

 

[1

In 1998, at the time of the Agreement, the political environment in Lithuania was characteristic
of a country in transition from its past being part of the Soviet Union to candidate for the
European Union membership. Thus, legislative changes, far from being unpredictable, were in
fact to be regarded as likely. As any businessman would, Claimant was aware of the risk that
changes of laws would probably occur after the conclusion of the Agreement. The
circumstances surrounding the decision to invest in Lithuania were certainly not an indication
of stability of the legal environment. Therefore, in such a situation, no expectation that the
laws would remain unchanged was legitimate.”

624. Legal doctrines makes a similar reflection, albeit for a different claim, taking the view that
each State has to exercise an objective minimum standard of due diligence that is linked to
the circumstances within the State in question:

In practice, tribunals will likely consider the state’s level of development and stability as
relevant circumstance in determining whether there has been due diligence. An investor
investing in an area with endemic civil strife and poor governance cannot have the same
expectation of physical security as one investing in London, New York or Tokyo.**”

The Tribunal believes that these considerations are pertinent in the present circumstances.
At the relevant time, Albania had just overcome a highly repressive and isolationist
communist regime where the rule of law, administrative procedures, and independent
judiciary had been destroyed and where environmental and social protection were
irrelevant to the process of policy making. In addition, Albania had lived through a severe
economic and financial crisis, which brought it to the brink of the complete collapse of its
State structures. To avoid a bigger catastrophe, foreign troops had to intervene. Claimant
knew the country well and had managed to establish business relations with the ancien
régime. When it decided to invest, it was aware that the country was in a dilapidated
situation, with its infrastructure run down and with its legal framework, regulation and
independent justice absent and with no stability. As Claimant has stated, “[e]ven for a
country in transition, the legal framework was exceptionably unstable, unclear and
contradictory” .*! It was obvious that the country was trying to get on its feet and build the
tule of law and democratic institutions. It had made some initial steps to provide an
infrastructure that would allow private investors, national as well as international, to pursue
structured and sustainable business activities.

The Tribunal holds that these circumstances matter. An investor may have been entitled to
rely on Albania’s efforts to live up to its obligations under international treaties, but that
investor was not entitled to believe that these effort would generate the same results of
stability as in Great Britain, USA or Japan.

This is partly the case because the governance was weak, as vividly described by
Claimant’s legal expert, Prof. Dobjani.

It is also so because Albania had to build a basic, modern infrastructure such as transport
and port facilities practically from scratch and with extremely limited resources. Albania
had to draft new laws and start to implement them. It had to build a modern State
administration, again with limited internal and financial resources. Under the
circumstances, it had to rely on international expertise and financial assistance.

Both aspects, the heritage of the past as well as the overwhelming necessities of the present
and future, must be taken in consideration when determining the obligation to provide a
stable and transparent legal framework. In fact, it would have been irrational in 1998/1999
to insist that Albania maintained the stability of its legal framework, proceedings and

general conditions as a status quo because this would have condemned the perpetuation of
an inadequate system that was still deeply entrenched in communist traditions. The
Tribunal concurs with Saluka v. Czech Republic, where the Tribunal held that
“expectations, in order to be protected, must rise to the level and reasonableness in light of
the circumstances” “**

The argument leads to another, interrelated problem. This concerns the relevance of
Claimant’s conduct prior to and during the execution of the investment and its relevance to
the establishment of the threshold for finding a violation of the FET standard, both with
respect to legitimate expectations in general and to the stability and transparency of the
legal framework in particular.

In Biwater v. Tanzania, the tribunal had held that “countervailing factors such as the
responsibility of foreign investors, both in terms of prior due diligence as well as
subsequent conduct’ must be taken into account to determine the threshold of violation.
Legitimate expectations are limited when “an investor itself takes on risks in entering a
particular investment environment” “3

In Lemire v. Ukraine, the tribunal equally insisted that it had to take “the investor’s
conduct in the host country” and in particular its “duty to perform an investigation before
effecting the investment” into consideration, not as an element for the mitigation of
damages but for the evaluation of the State’s conduct.***

In the same vein, the tribunal in MTD v. Chile, after having stated — in line with Tecmed —
that the State had an obligation of proactive protection of the investment, affirmed as
follows:

This conclusion of the Tribunal does not mean that Chile is responsible for the consequences of
unwise business decisions or for the lack of diligence of the investor. Its responsibility is
limited to the consequences of its own actions to the extent they breached the obligation to treat
Claimants fairly and equitably. The Tribunal will now address the alleged Claimants’ lack of
diligence and of prudent business judgment raised by Respondent.

 

The BITs are not an insurance against business risk and the Tribunal considers that Claimants
should bear the consequences of their own actions as experienced businessmen. Their choice of
partner, the acceptance of a land valuation based on future assumptions without protecting
themselves contractually in case the assumptions would not materialize, including the issuance

actions.

The Tribunal concurs with these findings. They reflect the specificities of the fair and
equitable standard, which protects investors against a certain conduct, namely inacceptable
and inappropriate changes of conditions and circumstances by the State. The investor is
entitled to rely on the stability and transparency of the legal framework. However, the
obligation of the State does not dispense the obligation of the investor to evaluate the
circumstances. Reliance has at its prerequisite diligent inquiry and information. The
investor has to understand the content and the context of the law and the administrative
practice. Put differently, the standard is addressed to both the State and the investor.
Fairness and equitableness cannot be established adequately without an adequate and
balanced appraisal of both parties’ conduct.

The Tribunal will now assess the facts of the case under these principles.

Claimant made its first visit to Durres and other ports of Albania in 1991. This was at a
time when the Greek-Albanian BIT had entered into force and when the Albanian
Government had started to implement a policy of welcoming foreign investment by
promulgating a new foreign investment law and by advertising investment opportunities,
notably in a brochure on the port of Durres which promoted investment.**°

From 1994, Claimant vetted initial investment proposals. One was sent by fax to Mr. Artan
Servani, a person who is not further identified,**” and another one by letter to the Minister
for Industry, Trade and Telecommunication. Both proposals referred to the ports of
Durres, Porto Romano and Vlora but indicated a preference for Durres. There was no
written response to these proposals.

488

Claimant’s witnesses testified unanimously that during their inquiries and investigations,
regular meetings were held with high-ranking political officials of the Albanian
government, including Ministers of the Economy, of Industry and of Energy as well as the
Prime Minister. They assert that during these meetings they regularly received
encouragement and support, and that Albanian partners urged them to apply for investment
approval in the port of Durres.

The course of these preliminary interactions between Claimant and Respondent were
described by Mr. Alexandros Mamidakis in his witness statement in the following terms:

6. Based on a twenty year business plan, which we considered very reasonable, and numerous
talks with government officials, we felt confident to invest in Albania. Initially we wanted to
purchase land for our operations, but such an opportunity did not materialize. Alternatively, we
looked at leasing a site for a planned tank farm.

7. The authorities recommended Durres as an investment site and assured us that the market
conditions would soon improve (see meeting below with the Minister of Economy and the
Minister of Energy). The site was previously also used for fuel tanks by the formerly state-
owned petrol company. The port of Durres was our first choice as it not only offered the
necessary general infrastructure but also a pipeline for the unloading of ships that was
specifically built for the operation of tank farms. At the meetings, there was no alternative
investment site discussed.

 

8. One of the meetings was held with the Minister of Economy (Mr. Anastas Angjeli) and the
Minister of Energy (Mr. Bufi) in 1998. Present at the meeting was also Mr. Kalfas (Technical
Consultant for Claimant) and Mr. Nikolaos Mamidakis (Managing Director). In this meeting,
both Ministers encouraged us to apply for an approval to invest in tank farms in the port of
Durres and assured us that the market conditions would soon improve and that the necessary
licenses for the operation will be granted. [...] At these meetings, we also discussed our plans
to establish an extensive retail-network. This included buying out existing petrol stations and
also setting up new stations. Both Ministers were eager to convince us to invest in Albania. We
applied to have our investment approved. After receiving the "go-ahead", we signed a lease
agreement and about half a year later we began the construction of the oil tanks.**

   

640. The Tribunal has no reason to doubt that the meetings were cordial and encouraging and

641.

that Albanian partners expressed their positive attitude to foreign investment in general and
to Claimant’s investment in particular. However, Claimant has not presented any evidence
in writing pointing to a specific commitment, no letter of intent, no agreed minutes, not
even an internal memorandum or a letter reacting positively to the investment proposals
made in 1994 and 1995.

In addition, when Claimant submitted its request to the Minister of Economy and
Privatization on 3 July 1998 to approve the investment in Durres, it again received no
answer. It took a reminder of the request some four months later, on 10 November 1998,
and additional two months until Claimant received, on 6 January 1999, a six-line approval
“in principle” signed by the Director of the Directorate of the maritime port under the
Minister of Public Works and Transport.*”° Claimant’s legal expert, Prof. Dobjani has
characterized the approval in principle as a statement meaning “why nof” or “it can be

done, we are not against iv?!

contractual undertakings. Specific representations play a central role in the creation of
legitimate expectations. Undertakings and representations made explicitly or implicitly by the
host state are the strongest basis for legitimate expectations. A reversal of assurances that have
led to legitimate expectations will violate the principle of fair and equitable treatment.**

However, assurances must be made if they are to be legally relevant. This is not a frivolous
matter as it may have important consequences. The person to whom an assurance is to be
imputed must be aware of the consequences of his or her actions, and the person who
wants to rely on it must reasonably discern the commitment. A representation, even by
conduct, must therefore amount to a clear and identifiable commitment, which is
attributable to the person who makes the representation, and which is reasonably conveyed
to the addressee. The Tribunal agrees with Continental v. Argentina and El Paso v.
Argentina, where the tribunals found that “[p]olitical statements [...] create no legal
expectations”.

In the present case, the interaction between the Parties consisted of investment proposals of
varied precision in 1994, 1995 and 1998, of which only the last proposal received a very
general positive reply, without any detailed assurance, as well as meetings evidenced by
witness statements of members of Claimant’s senior management which do not contain any
substantive commitment. In the Tribunal’s view, this does not amount to specific
representations and undertakings to assure the stability of the legal framework with
specific reference to Claimant’s investment.

Some six months after the approval in principle, on 2 June 1999, the second document on
which Claimant bases all its trust was issued, i.e. the lease agreement for a free site in the
port zone of Durres for a period of twenty years. The site was handed over to Claimant on
1 September 1999, “for the investment of a fuel storage center” "4

The Tribunal finds that the contract and the conditions of transfer of the site as documented
in the minutes are crucial and binding documents. They oblige Respondent to respect the
term of the lease and to allow the storage of petroleum products as well as their use.

Claimant has argued that:

this [the lease contract] did not only include the expectation that it could build and operate the
tank farm as planned for 20 years in the port of Durres; it of course also included the
expectation that the tank farm could be delivered by ships. You will not find any explicit
written document saying so, but tank farms are not built in ports by chance; they are built in
ports because tankers arrive at port, and Durres was explicitly selected for its pier.

The Tribunal does not share Claimant’s view. The lease contract is for a nominal monthly
rent of 83,952 LEK. It specifies the purpose of the lease as “setting up a fuel storage center
according to the business plan attached’. The business plan, in turn, does not mention the
use of port facilities for tankers. The wording and meaning of these clauses and text taken
together do not allow an interpretation that implicitly includes the right to discharge
petroleum vessels in the port. The common intention of the parties to create such an
important right and obligation for such a long period cannot be deducted on implied terms.
It would have been made explicit, as a specific and detailed right and with probable
repercussions on the calculation of the rent. For these reasons, the lease contract did not
extend to the use of the port facilities.

The fact that Respondent was under no contractual obligation to keep the port open for
Claimant’s vessels does not answer the question whether Respondent had an obligation
under the FET standard to provide stability of the port regime and use for the period of the
lease contract.

The Tribunal has pondered the Parties’ written and oral submissions. It has come to the
conclusion that at the time of the request for and approval of the construction of the tank
farm as well as the execution of the lease contract and the transfer of the site, i.e. until
September 1999, both Parties believed that “[a]t the port of Durrés all sorts of goods,
minerals, fuels, cements and other bulk articles are loaded and unloaded,”*>
continue to be so in the future.

and would

In applying its finding on undertakings, the Tribunal has found no assurances and
representations by Respondent in the sense of a continued availability of the port facilities
for petroleum tankers. There are no “decrees, licenses, and similar executive statements” to
this effect nor can any conduct by Respondent be identified that may be interpreted as a
representation. As stated, the terms of the lease contract do not allow the implication of
terms that encompass the use of the port.

However, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt that Claimant believed in 1998-early 1999
that the Government had no plans to change the policy inherited from the previous regime
and to modernize its maritime transport infrastructure for environmental protection and
economic efficiency, and that it would not close the port of Durres for petroleum vessels.

The Tribunal has also no reason to doubt that Respondent had no such plans at the time.
The Albanian Government had certainly embarked upon a transition to market structures,
modernization and improvements of the country’s infrastructure, but specific plans to
break with the past and transform the seaports of Durres, Porto Romano and other cities
were most probably not on its mind.

Various international reports and governmental statements reveal that transport
infrastructures in general and maritime transport infrastructures in particular were
dysfunctional and severely run down. Concrete solutions, recommendations for a new
orientation of public policy and the translation of these initiatives into national policies
emerged only when international experts such as Louis Berger Inc., retained in December
1998 under an IDA credit, started to conduct systematic analyses and to elaborate
comprehensive transport sector plans. The European Union provided other plans.

One such plan was the “Albanian National Transport Plan”, supported by the European
Commission, and another more-specific one was the “Land Use Plan” for the port of
Durres, which Louis Berger, Inc. presented in March 2000. The Albanian Government
discussed the latter plan both with its international partners and internally. As a result, it
rendered “Decision No. 294, dated 13 June 2000 for Approval of Plan Land Use in the Port
of Durres”.“°°

The Tribunal has no doubt that this plan has remained in force until today. Its
implementation took time, perhaps more time than expected, partly because the costly and
complex infrastructure for petroleum products in Porto Romano had to be created from
scratch. Difficulties and delays notwithstanding, Albania, with the ongoing expert support
and financial assistance of international donors, has pursued a consistent policy of transport
sector and regulatory reform including the Land Use Plan for the port of Durres. This is
evidenced, to the Tribunal’s satisfaction, in various reports and reviews established by the
Government and various international agencies such as the World Bank and the European
Commission. The reports relate at the same time that the policy change had positive
impacts for economic development and environmental protection.

The Tribunal holds that it was within the realm of Respondent’s sovereign power to adopt
the Land Use Plan for Durres, change the zoning regulations and prohibit the unloading of
petroleum cargo. The measures pursued a legitimate objective of public policy, were
carried out in a transparent way, were proportionate and not arbitrary, and did not lead to
unreasonable instability, as developed below.

At the relevant time, Claimant was aware that the country’s infrastructure was in a very
bad state and that its regulatory system was completely inadequate. Albania had to
overcome the heritage of its isolationist communist system in order to achieve a normal
economic, social and ecological development. Conscious of its weaknesses, Albania asked
international development agencies for advice and assistance to formulate a coherent
public policy for the transport sector. It received the advice, reviewed it, made it its own
evaluation and implemented policy with positive long-term results, which taken together

improved the general investment environment and the protection of investments in
Albania.

The Tribunal is not fully aware of the chronology of the Louis Berger, Inc. study and
report. After the execution of the contract, the experts started their work in early 1999 to
submit a final report and recommendations in March 2000. It seems plausible that after
having collected the necessary data, they started to draft a first set of recommendations,
which they shared informally with Albanian officials. The evidentiary record shows that
long before these recommendations were finalized, the port authorities approached
Claimant and the other investors that had an interest in Durres. They strongly advised them
to suspend their investments until the official results of the study were known and policy
measures were taken. The port authority wrote a first letter to this effect on 17 November
1999. The letter refers to prior oral notifications. The Tribunal has no reason to assume that
this statement is incorrect. The Tribunal sees this as efforts to act transparently in the
preparation of its regulatory adjustments for a modern infrastructure.

 

The Tribunal finds that Respondent has made various efforts to attenuate the consequences
of its legitimate policy choices for Claimant. When Claimant received the first warnings
about the possible transport policy and land use changes, it had not yet started to construct
the tank farm. Claimant’s statement that only “when nearly all of the money was sunk into
the bottom, government came and said, ‘Well, we are sorry, but we now have completely
different plans for Durres iT
interest, it suspended the implementation of the Land Use Plan, allowed the termination of
the construction of the tank farm and the landing, and permitted the discharging of
petroleum tankers until 2009, the date of the opening of the petroleum port in Porto
Romano. During that period, Claimant operated its tank farm profitably. At the same time,
Respondent repeatedly offered preferential treatment in offering Claimant a site in this new
port. The implementation of the Land Use Plan did not “entirely transform and alter the
legal and business environment under which the investment was decided and made”, as
was the situation found by several tribunals in the context of the Argentine crisis.°*
Respondent rather pursued the modernization of its economy and transport sector in a
gradual way. The Tribunal takes the view that, even where certain shortcomings may have
existed in Respondent’s “good governance”, as described by Professor Dobjani,
Claimant’s legal expert,” Such shortcomings do not amount to a violation of the

The Tribunal further finds that Respondent did not treat Claimant arbitrarily when adopting
the Land Use Plan in 2000 and closing the port for tankers in 2009. The measures did not
affect Claimant alone but all companies operating in Durres. It is true that these were only
Geek companies. However, this was because Greek operators had received preferential
treatment after an intervention of the Greek Government in July 2000. No other investor
had received a permission to operate in Durres after the Land Use Plan had been adopted.
The fact that only Greek investors were affected by the closure of the port in 2009 is
therefore not an expression of discrimination of one nation, but the consequence of the fact
that they had previously obtained a privileged position.

Finally, the Tribunal finds that the policy and regulatory changes were not in violation of
the obligation to provide stability of the legal framework. With respect to the elaboration,
adaption and implementation of the Land Use Plan, Respondent has not enacted a
multitude of regulations, and there has been no back and forth of ever-changing and
contradictory norms or administrative processes. Respondent has, after consultation and
reflection, decided to pursue a legitimate public policy for the port of Durres. The decision
process as well as the implementation were guided by a long-term perspective and not by
erratic considerations. Changes at the implementation stage did not change the content of
the policy or the zoning plan. They were a response to difficulties in the field and had
repercussions for that period only.

For these reasons, the Tribunal rejects Claimant’s assertion that Respondent violated its
obligation to provide a stable and transparent legal framework when (a) it changed the
Land Use Plan for the port of Durres in 2000 and (b) prohibited petroleum tankers to land
and be discharged at the port in 2009.

In its Memorial, Claimant asserted a further violation of the obligation to provide a stable
and transparent legal framework based on Respondent’s reduction of the minimum storage
capacity in 2002 from 3000 m3 to 300 m3 followed by an increase back to 3000 m? in 2008.

Claimant alleges that the reduction “did not serve any legitimate purpose” °° At the same
time, it contends that the new regulation “made it very easy for small local companies and

individuals to engage in the wholesale trade”.~°'

Respondent rejects these arguments and submits that the regulatory measures were aimed

“to enhance market competition” and not at Claimant.

Only limited evidence has been presented to the Tribunal on this issue. The Tribunal has
difficulties to understand why the measures led to wholesalers not adhering to the

minimum reserve requirement, as contended by Claimant.’ Was this the consequence of

the Government measure or simple disregard of the law? Whatever the answer might be,
and notwithstanding the scarcity of evidence, the Tribunal finds that opening the market to
small local competitors is a legitimate public policy objective.

The measure opened a niche where large traders like Claimant would not operate, and it
created opportunities of free competition. The measure might be considered experimental
and at the margin of the market. In any event, the Tribunal has no means to appraise the
overall result since Claimant has not provided any evidence to this effect. The Tribunal
recognizes, however, that the introduction of the measure was transparent and that the
measure remained in effect for five years. It seems to have been revoked in 2008 because
of European requirements, and perhaps also because the desired policy effect had not
materialized. The Tribunal does not characterize two changes in policy in the course of five
years as evidence of instability of the legal framework.

For these reasons, the Tribunal rejects Claimant’s assertion that Respondent violated its
obligation to provide a stable and transparent legal framework when it decreased the
reserve requirements in 2002 and increased them again in 2008.

In its Memorial, Claimant has asserted a further violation of the obligation to provide a
stable and transparent legal framework, namely that Respondent failed to provide
information to Claimant about the requirements for an environmental license and the
construction permits.>™

In the section of this Award concerning jurisdiction, the Tribunal dealt extensively with the
different permits and licenses at issue. It has found that the various laws were transparent
and clear, both for the procedures to follow and for the authorities to address. The Tribunal
has also expressed its view that Claimant had a duty of due diligence to inquire about the
law applicable for the permits, and it was established during the hearing that legal advice
was available in Albania. Claimant’s position that “we don’t need a lawyer” is not
acceptable.*”°

The Tribunal is aware that, during the period of Claimant’s investment, the Albanian
Government was still struggling with the consequences of the communist system and the
severe financial crisis it had gone through afterwards. That said, even assuming a
weakness of governance, this did not relieve Claimant of the obligation to pursue its own
investigation, to the contrary. It was easy to understand the requirements for the application
for the construction site permit and the construction permit under the Laws on Urban

Planning. These requirements, including the forms to be used for the applications, were
transparent and remained consistent despite the enactment of a new law in 1998. Claimant
has not tested the application of the law by Albanian authorities since it did not make
proper applications.

As to the environmental permit, the “Law on Environmental Protection” of 2002
maintained the application procedures of its predecessor law of 1993. That is well
documented by the fact that Claimant received the license, after a number of inspections
and exchanges of correspondence, based on the original application, which predated the
2002 law.

The Tribunal does not discount the imperfections of the Albanian administration and the
related lack of communication. However, these do not amount to a violation of the
requirement of a stable and transparent legal framework in the context of the issuance of
licenses and permits. This is because the legal texts were stable and transparent. In one
case, Claimant decided not to act according to the law, and in the other case, it applied for
a license according to the law and received it.

For these reasons, the Tribunal rejects Claimant’s assertion that Respondent failed to
provide a stable and transparent legal framework when it introduced the new Land Use
Plan for the port of Durres in 2000, when it changed the minimum reserve requirements in
2002 and again in 2008, when it closed the port of Durres for petroleum tankers in 2009,
and when the issue of permits arose in 1999.

6.2.2 Legitimate expectations
6.2.2.1 Claimant’s position

Claimant also asserts that Respondent violated the FET standard by failing to respect
Respondent’s legitimate expectations.

Claimant insists, based on Tecmed v. Mexico and Saluka v. Czech Republic, that the
protection of the investor’s legitimate expectations is a fundamental and dominant element
of the host State’s obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment.

Claimant presents its position as follows:

The underlying purpose of protecting an investor's legitimate expectations is to enable a
foreign investor to make rational business decisions in reliance on the legal framework as

provided by the host state, as well as on the host state’s representations and undertakings. As
has been shown above, such representations and undertakings include representations by
executive organs, in legislation, treaties, decrees, licenses, permits and contracts. An arbitrary
reversal of such undertakings amounts to a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.

 

From the above, it follows that under international law and the BIT a hos ite is not allowed to
frustrate the legitimate expectations of an investor by taking decisions and applying
procedures that would damage an investment which was made on the basis of such legitimate
expectations. If it nevertheless does so, it has to pay compensation.*”

 
   

In support of its position, Claimant quotes CME v. Czech Republic, where the tribunal
found that the State:

breached its obligation of fair and equitable treatment by evisceration of the arrangements in
reliance upon which the foreign investor was induced to invest.*"*

Claimant also cites Thunderbird v. Mexico, where the tribunal held that when

a Contracting Party’s conduct creates reasonable and justifiable expectations on the part of an
investor (or investment) to act in reliance on said conduct, such that a failure by the NAFTA.
Party to honour those expectations could cause the investor (or investment) to suffer damages.*”

Claimant contends that Respondent’s actions created a legitimate expectation on the part of
Claimant. Respondent approved the investment, as detailed in its business plan, as well as
the operation of the tank farm for 20 years in the Port of Durres. Although neither the
lease contract nor the business plan explicitly refers to filling of the reservoirs by vessels,
this was obviously part of the engagement based on the context, the wording of the lease
contract and earlier correspondence. The unloading of tankers was an integral part of the
business plan. Moreover, Claimant’s expectations were re-affirmed when Respondent
allowed the termination of the construction in December 2000.

Claimant asserts that Respondent breached its legitimate expectations, which resulted from
Respondent’s assurances on three occasions that Claimant “was entitled to use the tank
farm for 20 years as planned”. Contrary to the representations, (1) Respondent informed
Claimant in June 2000 “that it would in future no longer be allowed to operate the tank
farm in Durres port’, (2) it granted only temporary permits and (3) it prohibited the
discharge of fuel vessels beginning in 2009.5"°

6.2.2.2 Respondent’s position

Respondent refutes Claimant’s arguments and, in addition to the submissions summarized
under paragraphs 586 to 590 of this Award, makes the following contentions.

Given the political, economic and social situation in Albania and the circumstances of the
transition to an open-market system and integration into the international trade, Claimant
had no legitimate reason to expect that the use of the port of Durres would remain
unchanged for the total term of the lease contract. Claimant was only entitled to rely on the
terms of the contract. At no time has Respondent questioned the validity of the contract,
and it continues to respect its terms.

In particular, Respondent has never made any representation that Claimant would be
authorized to use the port of Durres for discharging vessels carrying petroleum products for
the totality of the term of the lease contract. On the contrary, Respondent informed
Claimant as early as autumn 1999, before the implementation of the investment, that this
would not be the case.*!!

The closing of the port for ships was not discriminatory. On the contrary, the authorization
to operate in Durres was a privilege extended to Claimant and the other Greek companies
for the first eight years of its operation. All other petroleum importers had not been
allowed to settle in Durres in anticipation of the master plan, and the closing established an
equal playing field in the execution of this plan.*!?

The closing of the port was not arbitrary because it was motivated by the concern for
protecting an overriding general interest.”

In light of the agreement brokered in 2000 by the Greek government, Claimant was entitled
to expect that it could remain in Durres until completion of the construction works in Porto
Romano, terminate the construction of the tank farm, operate the tank farm, and fill the
tanks by tankers until that time. It could further expect that the terms of the trading license
would be honored. These expectations were fully respected and honored until 2009 “to a
point that others started complaining” .°'*

Claimant has neither applied for nor received the licenses and permits which were
indispensable for the legal construction and operation of the tank farm. “Claimant never
asked the Government to waive any of the necessary authorizations and approvals [...],
acted illegally and must for this reason in and of itself be precluded from relying on any

expectations whatsoever, as illegality cannot give rise to a right, let alone a claim? 5°

Indeed, Respondent neither waived nor forfeited its right and duty to insist on these permits
prescribed by law to protect important public interests, nor did it make representations that
it would not apply the law.

In this connection, it was Claimant’s duty of due diligence to find out what permits were
516
needed.

6.2.2.3 The Determination of the Tribunal

A first issue has already been treated: The Tribunal has not found explicit representations
by Respondent assuring Claimant that it would be authorized to land and discharge tankers
in the port of Durres.

In the same vein, the Tribunal finds it to be evident that Respondent did not assure
Claimant that it would not need to comply with the legally prescribed licenses and permits.

Therefore, the Tribunal must examine Respondent’s conduct and other circumstances that
could justify the legitimacy of Claimant’s alleged expectations.

Given the timeline of Claimant’s investment, the intervention of the international donors
and consultants, and Respondent’s decision and actions, the Tribunal has first to determine
whether there was a point at which legitimate expectations could have been created.

In broad terms, the Tribunal holds that legitimate expectations can only arise at the time
the investment is made. Investors base their plans on circumstances and conditions as they
find them, and they can only rely on conditions as they exist at that period. These factors
can legitimately be taken into account when weighing the environment of the investment
decisions. Subsequent developments are speculative and to be left out of this consideration.
This extends as much to improvements in the legal and regulatory environment as to
unpredictable deteriorations in the same.

Arbitral tribunals confirm this opinion. As expressed by the tribunal in AES v. Hungary,
“This rule that legitimate expectations can only be created at the moment of the investment,
has been supported by several ICSID tribunals”.>\” Likewise, in Duke Energy v. Ecuador,
the tribunal found that “to be protected, the investor’s expectations must be legitimate and

reasonable at the time when the investor makes the investment’, '8 and in LG&E v.
Argentina, the tribunal determined that “[i]n addition to the state’s obligation to provide a
stable legal and business environment, the fair and equitable treatment analysis involves
consideration of the investor’s expectations when making its investment in reliance on the
protections to be granted by the host state”.°'° In the same vein, the Tecmed v. Mexico
tribunal assessed what fair expectation Claimant might have “/ujpon making its
investment’.*°

697. In most cases, arbitral tribunals are not preoccupied with distinguishing between the time
when the investor decides to invest and the time when it actually effects the investment.

698. In Duke Energy v. Ecuador, the tribunal first explained, “the legitimate expectations which
are protected are those on which the foreign party relied when deciding to invest” and
continues to state that it must be those at the time when the investor makes the
investment.””! In Enron v. Argentina, the tribunal found “that these expectations derived
from the conditions that were offered by the State to the investor at the time of the
investment and that such conditions were relied upon by the investor when deciding to
invest” to conclude thereafter that the decisive time was when the investment was “decided
and implemented” >> The Tecmed v. Mexico tribunal took care to specify that the
expectations existed at the time “when the agreement commenced to be performed” >? and
the AES v. Hungary tribunal found it crucial to determine when Claimant “actually began
to invest in (spend money on)” the investment.°~4

699. The Tribunal notes that the instant case is distinct from the cited matters because in those
cases the investor had decided to invest and had effectuated the investment by the time the
host State took measures in alleged violation of legitimate expectations, which allegedly
existed both at the time of decision to invest and when the investor began to spend money.

700. The present case is different insofar as the exact timing is of the essence. Claimant made its
concrete decision to invest and requested the respective approval in June and November

1998; Respondent approved the investment in January 1999; the Parties executed the lease
agreement in June 1999, with the site transferred in September 1999; the construction
works, which would cost some 8 million USD, commenced in February/March 2000, were
suspended in July 2000 with a completion rate of 80-85%, and were terminated in late
2000. In October/November 1999, Respondent informed Claimant that policy changes with
respect of the use of the port of Durres were underway and strongly advised Claimant to
suspend the works. In July 2000, Respondent ordered the termination of the works, based
on the Decision of June 2000 to change the character of the port.

Given the specificities of this particularly narrow timeline, the Tribunal has to determine
precisely whether there was a moment when legitimate expectations may have been
created and would be owed protection.

The Tribunal understands that an investment is a long process and cannot be reduced to a
specific point in time. The present case documents this statement perfectly: almost ten
years passed between Claimant’s first investigations in 1991 to the construction of the farm
in 2000. The Tribunal agrees with Schreuer and Kriebaum, who state that “/t]he
realization that an investment is often not a single right or an isolated transaction but a
combination of rights and an integrated process of transactions is important also for the
timing of the legitimate expectations upon which investment decisions rely. If the
investment cannot be reduced to a onetime event but is seen as a process, the identification
of the relevant time for the existence of legitimate expectations becomes more difficult” 25

The Tribunal has pondered the different arguments that could be used to pinpoint a precise
moment for the emergence of the expectations. It believes in general that it has to take the
objective of the standard into account. The standard has developed to protect an investor
against unpredictable, unfair and unreasonable policy measures. At the outset, this
impliedly recognizes a State’s legitimate interest and right to change conditions reasonably
for public policy purposes. Both aspects have to be balanced when establishing the right
point in time during a long and complex process from when a State is restricted in the use
of its sovereign power and the investor is protected.

While it remains difficult to arrive at an exact measurement, this reflection helps in a first
stage to eliminate certain periods. It would evidently burden the potential host State
disproportionately to protect expectations that the potential investor might have during first
brainstorming activities and early field visits, such as Claimant’s, with no precise plan in
mind. Even when a precise plan is established, it would still not be reasonable to protect
expectations related to the plan if the potential host State has not taken note of the plan and
approved it. The reason is that during this period the potential investor retains its freedom

5 RLA-2, page 273.

134

705.

706.

707.

708.

and flexibility and is able to react to policy changes without material losses, while the
potential host State has not yet expressed any commitment.

An argument can be made that once both parties have come to an agreement about the
future investment, the expectations are properly defined and created, and the State is bound
to respect them. This is certainly the case when the State has made representations as to the
stability of specific conditions. It is less evident when no such representations exist, as is
the present case. When weighing both parties’ interests, it seems obvious that the potential
investor still retains a considerable degree of flexibility and is able to desist at no or limited
costs, while the State is asked to protect an investment that has not yet materialized.

 

The situation changes dramatically when the investment is actually made. At that point in
time, the investor loses its flexibility and depends on consistent conduct of the host State,
while the State is then limited in its ability to exercise its sovereign power in a way that
deviates unreasonably from its previous conduct and changes the conditions on which the
investor was entitled to rely. In fact, the actual implementation of the investment is more
than a pure execution of a prior decision but rather is part of a continuous process and its
accomplishment.

Therefore, the Tribunal finds it difficult to fix a precise point in time within a long process
of decision-making and implementation. Rather, the evolving and gradual nature of the
process has to be taken into consideration with an objective to balance both parties’
interests. That leads to the necessity of a concrete appraisal of these interests when judging
the host State’s measures. The investor’s flexibility is reduced the more it commits funds
to implementation, and the gradual loss of flexibility increases the legitimate expectation of
stability and protection, while the State, although retaining its right and duty to pursue
public policy objectives, is obliged to respect the legitimate expectations by pursuing the
objectives consistently, coherently and predictably.

In light of these considerations, the Tribunal will determine, in the context of specific
measures, whether the approval of the investment in January 1999, the execution of the
lease contract in June 1999, the transfer of the site in September 1999 and the construction
of the tank farm in February/March 2000 created legitimate expectations. Rather than
pointing to a precise day or hour as the decisive moment when expectations may have
come into existence, the Tribunal finds that it is more appropriate to consider a period as a
whole delimited, on the one hand, by the transfer of the construction site in September
1999, and on the other hand, by the start of the construction in February/March 2000.
Claimant received the first warning notices while expectations were still not crystallized;
the issuance of the new Land Use Plan and the order to suspend the construction occurred
later and therefore fall outside this period.

The Tribunal has to determine the existence of legitimate expectations in relation to two
types of State conduct.

The first issue concerns whether Claimant was entitled to legitimately expect at any
moment between the approval of the investment in January 1999 and the construction of
the tank farm in February/March 2000 that it would be dispensed from applying for and
receiving the construction site permit, the construction permit and the exploitation permit.

Claimant’s legal expert unambiguously answered a related question during an exchange in
cross-examination:

Dr. Gharavi: Mr Dobjani, just to follow up on the question and answer exchange with Mr
Hammond, I trust you are not suggesting that tomorrow I can go to your country, build a tank
farm without the permits, and if nobody catches me and finds out that I do not have the permits
then I am okay, my operation would be legal? You're not suggesting this, correct?

Mr. Dobjani: Of course not. I don't think you should ask me that question at all in fact.*”°

In confirming its jurisdiction, the Tribunal ascertained that the complete absence of
application for the construction site permit and the construction permit and the incomplete
application for the exploitation permit as well as the absence of these permits were illegal
according to the Law on Urban Planning and the Law on Control and Regulation of the
Construction Works. It equally found, after hearing both expert witnesses on Albanian law
that the permits pertain to important economic, social and environmental objectives and
cannot be dismissed lightly.

These findings notwithstanding, the Tribunal affirmed its jurisdiction because after the
construction of the tank farm, Respondent did not draw the consequences it could have
drawn. Rather, it offered to help with the legalization of the situation after the receipt of the
necessary application from Claimant.

This conduct has no bearing on the determination of the legitimacy of Claimant’s
expectations, which may have arisen at any time between the approval of the request for
the investment and the construction of the tank farm. The conduct post-dates the totality of
the investment process. It is left out of consideration when ascertaining the expectations.

It is possible that at some point in time, Claimant started to hope that Respondent would
not insist on the permits. However, this expectation cannot have existed when it built the
tank farm in 2000. On the contrary, Claimant had announced in its request of 3 July 1998
that “[flollowing this approval, we will continue our job for [...] getting the respective

Tr., day 4, page 136.

720.

721.

permits for the accomplishment of the works? °27 Respondent did not signal that it would
waive this requirement by its behavior or in the approval letter or any other document.

Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the construction and the operation of the tank farm did
not comply with Albanian law and were illegal. In the circumstances, Claimant is not
entitled to rely on the perpetuation of its activities in illegal circumstances and cannot
claim a violation of legitimate expectations with respect to the illegal operation of the tank
farm. This finding is consistent with the Tribunal’s earlier view that it has jurisdiction to
hear the claims, given that Respondent had shown its willingness to consider a legalization
once the respective applications were made. Absent such legalization, however, Claimant
could not legitimately expect that it could continue its activities in Albania despite their
illegality.

The second issue concerns the closing of the port of Durres for petroleum vessels from
2009. The Tribunal must determine whether Claimant was entitled to rely on the continued
use of the port to fill the reservoirs until the term of the lease contract expired.

Again, the Tribunal will examine whether there is a time at which legitimate expectations
may have been created. The exact moment is crucial because, between the approval of the
investment in January 1999 and the transfer of the site in September 1999 on the one hand,
and the implementation of the investment as from February/March 2000 on the other hand,
Claimant received notices that a new Land Use Plan was under consideration and that the
port of Durres might be closed for tankers.

The Tribunal is conscious that Claimant as well as Respondent, at the time of executing the
lease and transferring the site in 1999, had proceeded on the assumption that the port
would remain open for the transport of petroleum products. Claimant relied on this
assumption, prepared the site and undertook the construction works beginning in
February/March 2000.

At the same time, Claimant had not yet started to spend the 8 million USD, the cost of the
construction of the tank farm. Claimant’s affirmation that “[n]o reasonable businessman
invests several million USD into a project the legal future of which is uncertain””® is
belied by Claimant, indeed, spending the money when it was aware that the legal future of

the port of Durres was uncertain.

When Claimant received the first requests in October/November 1999 to suspend the
works until the Government had made a final policy decision on the future of the port,
under the advice of their international consultants, it had still a great deal of flexibility and

*7 CE-15.
*8 Cl. Mem., para. 262.

137

722.

723.

724.

725.

726.

would not have suffered significant financial losses had it suspended the preparatory
works. There is no doubt that Claimant would have had to return to a planning process that
it had thought was closed. With Durres encumbered by the uncertainty of its future
orientation, it would have had to re-consider alternatives such as Vlora and Porto Romano.
It may have incurred additional time and — in the short run — lost opportunities in the
emerging Albanian economy. It is, however, not excluded that it would have profited from
the improved Albanian infrastructure in the medium and long term.

The improvement and modernization of such run-down and dysfunctional infrastructure
was at the heart of policy preoccupations and planning priorities of the Albanian
Government and their international development partners. They were legitimate and
serious. They were communicated at a time when the suspension of the investment was
still financially not too burdensome.

In the balancing of the Parties, the Tribunal believes that it has to give weight to the
legitimate interest of the Albanian Government to modernize the infrastructure in the
general interest, which ultimately encompasses all foreign investors’ interests. This is
because Albania had just emerged from a long period of communist stagnation, isolation
and post-communist crisis. Both private investment and public infrastructure were needed
at the same time, with some jostling effect.

When weighing both interests under the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that it must take
Claimant’s continued flexibility into consideration as well as Respondent’s public policy
imperatives. It is not true that — as alleged — Respondent changed its mind without warning
when most of the money was sunk. Respondent informed Claimant, warned Claimant and
reasonably requested a suspension of the works. By determining whether the construction
of the tank farm by Claimant created legitimate expectations, the Tribunal must give
meaning to these warnings.

Even if the Tribunal had found that legitimate expectations had plainly arisen when the
investment was approved, the lease contract executed and the site transferred, and the
warnings had come too late to have an impact, it would still need to determine whether the
closing of the port violated Respondent’s obligation to respect Claimant’s expectations.

Other arbitral tribunals have found that the revocation of a license or the prohibition of a
previously authorized activity or the withdrawal of an approval to invest breached the host
States’ obligation to respect the investors’ expectations. The Tecmed v. Mexico tribunal
found that the investor was entitled to rely on a license and that its revocation violated the
obligation to respect its legitimate expectations even if national law authorized the State to

* Técnica:

revoke a license.>”’ In Eureko v. Poland, the withdrawal of a consent to invest further was
equally considered such a violation.°*°
where the tribunal found that the revocation of an approval to invest frustrated legitimate
expectations.**!

The same result was reached in MTD v. Chile

The above-mentioned awards have no direct relevance for the dispute at hand. The
Tribunal notes that in all these cases the host States’ actions targeted the investment itself
and not the business environment. Transposed to the present case, the equivalent of the
revocation of a license would have been the termination of the lease contract. The Tribunal
has no doubt that Claimant had legitimate expectations that Respondent would not revoke
the contract, and indeed Albania did not revoke the Lease contract. However, this is not the
issue since the use of the port facilities is not part of the contract. The Tribunal has already
rejected Claimant’s allegation that the right to fill the reservoirs by ship was implied in the
general rights under the lease.

Claimant could have negotiated an extension of the scope of the lease to the port facilities,
or it could have requested a guarantee for their use during its term. It chose not to do so.

Moreover, as the Tribunal has already noted, Respondent did not make any representations
or gave assurances that the port’s use would remain unchanged.

Consequently, the Tribunal has to determine whether Claimant had a _ legitimate
expectation to access the port as part of the general conditions and circumstances at the
time of the investment which Respondent was bound to maintain.

As stated, the Tribunal has to balance Claimant’s expectations and the State’s right to
regulate in the public interest. It is generally accepted that there must be more on
Claimant’s side than the subjective hope that nothing will change for the worse. The
Tribunal agrees with the determination in PSEG Global that “Legitimate expectations by
definition require a promise of the administration on which Claimants rely to assert a right
that needs to be observed’. The promise may be implicit, and it encompasses the
obligation to act consistently, diligently, even-handedly and transparently. However, the
promise must exist and be identifiable under the circumstances in order to transform a
subjective hope into objective expectations.

The Tribunal finds that the Albanian policy, supported by the international donor
community and expert advice, is consistent and beneficial for investors and consumers in
the long run. It had and has the objective of leaving the communist heritage of maritime
transport infrastructure behind, rehabilitating and modernizing the port facilities of Durres
with respect to environmental protection and in view of increased passenger and
merchandise operations, and building modern petroleum-handling facilities in Porto
Romano.

The implementation of this policy, which includes the closure of the port of Durres in
2009, does not offend a sense of propriety. In a different context, the Tribunal has already
expressed its view that the fact that this decision accommodated the interests of
competitors that had been barred from Durres from the beginning does not change this
appreciation.

Even if Claimant did not expect this development to happen, it is not legitimate to insist
that the old structures be perpetuated. When balancing both Parties’ interests, Respondent’s
right to conduct a public policy of consistent modernization prevails. In any event, as
explained above, Claimant was given repeated warnings about the change in Albania’s
policy.

The Tribunal therefore finds that Claimant had no legitimate expectations that it would be
allowed to operate the tank farm in disregard of its obligation to apply for and obtain basic
and important permits and licenses; nor could Claimant legitimately rely on the possibility
of discharging petroleum vessels in the port of Durres for the total term of the lease
contract. Both aspects have to be considered together. They reinforce each other. During
the period ranging from the transfer of the site to the construction of the tank farm,
Claimant may have hoped that the new policy would not affect it and that it may operate
the tank farm without applying for and obtaining the required permits, which are
determinative to the legality of the operation. At the same time, hope must not be
confounded with legitimate expectation. When Claimant started to construct the tank farm,
it could not legitimately expect that it would be allowed firstly to operate it without the
permits and secondly to discharge tankers in Durres port when it was clear that the port
would no longer operate. Consequently, Respondent did not violate its obligation to respect
Claimant’s legitimate expectations.

6.2.3. The alleged exertion of pressure
6.2.3.1 | Claimant’s position

736. Claimant asserts that the exertion of a State’s pressure on an investor in order to achieve
the renegotiation or rescission of an investment violates the obligation to provide fair and
equitable treatment.

737.

x

Claimant relies on a number of arbitral awards where the principle was clearly
acknowledged. In LG&E v. Argentina, the tribunal held:

Argentina also has acted unfairly and inequitably in forcing the licensees to renegotiate public
service contracts, and waive the right to pursue claims against the Government, or risk
rescission of the contracts. Even though the Gas Law provided for the renegotiation of public
service Contracts, in practice there was no real renegotiation, but rather the imposition of a
process.

 

738. In similar terms, the tribunal in Vivendi v. Argentina reached the conclusion that

. while it would have been entirely proper for a new government with a different policy
perspective on privatisation to seek to renegotiate a concession agreement in a transparent non-
coercive manner, it is clearly wrong (and unfair and inequitable in terms of the BIT) to seek
to bring a concessionaire to the renegotiation table through threats of rescission ...°™*

739. Claimant contends that Respondent “prohibited the discharge of fuel tankers in Durres
port’ when it realized in 2007 that Claimant “would only agree to the relocation if it was
compensated for frustrated investments and relocation costs”. Respondent refused to offer

compensation and “used its governmental power to try and force Claimant’s tank farm out

6.2.3.2 Respondent’s position

Respondent rejects/disputes Claimant’s position. It asserts that the closing of the port of
Durres was a bona fide regulatory measure taken for the general public welfare that had
been announced since the initial adoption of the Land Use Plan for Durres in 2000.°%°

Moreover, Respondent never ordered Claimant to relocate to Porto Romano nor did it
prohibit the use of the tank farm. Therefore, according to Respondent, there was no reason
to exercise any pressure to achieve the relocation. Claimant decided not to apply for a new
trading license and thereby provoked the end of feasibility of the investment.>*”

6.2.3.3. The Determination of the Tribunal

The Tribunal does not see in what way Respondent exercised “coercion and
harassment”>** and forced Claimant to renegotiate the terms of its investment or to rescind

it.
The contradictory positions of the Parties with respect to possible compensation for the

costs of relocation of the tank farm to Porto Romano were clearly expressed from the
beginning of the relevant period and never changed.

In one of the warning communications dated 15 February 2000, i.e. at around the time the
construction started, Respondent reiterated its request to suspend the works on the
reservoirs because “[iJnstalling them would be of financial consequences to your
company”? Respondent defended this position consistently and transparently until the
last communication on the issue in 2009.

During the same period, Respondent announced that it would close the port of Durres. The
Land Use Plan of June 2000 contains this announcement, and the negotiated compromise
of December 2000 foresaw that Claimant was authorized to discharge ships in Durres until
the facilities in Porto Romano were completed. None of these documents refers to a duty of
relocation. Rather, Respondent repeatedly offered Claimant a privileged site in Porto
Romano for the eventuality that it would relocate but confirmed at the same time that it
would not force Claimant to abandon the tank farm in Durres. On the contrary, it
authorized Claimant to fill the reservoirs from the port as long as Porto Romano was not in
operation. The Tribunal considers this a fair treatment under the circumstances.

The issue of missing permits is of no relevance in the present context. The local branch of
Government raised this issue from 2001, and the central Government insisted anew on
regularizing the situation of missing permits during a meeting of a working group on
relocation in 2003. This conduct cannot be qualified as an exercise of coercion.
Respondent reminded Claimant of its legal obligation, and Claimant, as developed in the
previous section, had no legitimate expectation that the issue would be abandoned.

On the contrary, Claimant decided to spend the money for the construction of the tank farm
despite the warnings. It expressed its willingness to relocate if Respondent was ready to
compensate it for the costs of relocation. The Tribunal does not see a legal basis for such a
claim.

In the Tribunal’s view, the position of both Parties could not be clearer and more
transparent. Both Parties maintained their positions, both were conscious of the each
other’s point of view, and neither could convince the other to change its position.
Respondent did not coerce Claimant to change its mind.

The Tribunal therefore rejects Claimant’s assertion that Respondent treated it unfairly and
inequitably through the exercise of pressure to relocate the tank farm without
compensation. The Tribunal notes, in addition, that Claimant never relocated its business
in any event.

6.2.4 Denial of Justice

6.2.4.1 | Claimant’s position

Claimant asserts in its Memorial that Respondent “also committed a denial of justice” >”

In its Reply, it explains that “errors in judgments constitute a breach of the fair and
equitable treatment standard’ in terms of denial of justice if they amount to a ‘clearly
improper and discreditable’ decision or include a ‘clear and malicious misapplication of
the law’? It quotes from Mondev v. USA, which provides:

The test is not whether a particular result is surprising, but whether the shock or surprise
occasioned to an impartial tribunal leads, on reflection, to justified concerns as to the judicial
propriety of the outcome, bearing in mind on the one hand that international tribunals are not
courts of appeal, and on the other hand that [the provision on fair and equitable treatment in
treaties for the protection of investments] is intended to provide a real measure of protection.
In the end the question is whether, at an international level and having regard to generally
accepted standards of __ the administration of justice, a tribunal can conclude in
the light of all the available facts that the impugned decision was clearly improper and

discreditable, with the result that the investment has been subjected to unfair and inequitable
treatment.*?

It also refers to Pantechniki v. Albania, where the tribunal found that only errors of a
degree which no “
justice.

“competent judge could reasonably have made” constitute a denial of

Claimant explains further that it “is generally acknowledged that denial of justice requires
that the investor first exhausts local remedies as this concept refers to the incapability of

the whole host state’s judicial system to provide the foreign investor with fair and equitable

treatment” >“

Based on this analysis, Claimant develops its

position that the Supreme Court judgement [sic] is improper and discredible [sic], a judgement
[sic] which no competent judge could reasonably have ever made. Claimant’s legal expert
testifies that under Albanian law there had been two legal venues to claim reimbursement of
unjustifiedly [sic] paid taxes. The incriminated Supreme Court judgement [sic] surprisingly
changed this jurisprudence on which Claimant's subsidiary had relied. It resulted in Mamidoil
Albanian having lost all legal remedies against the unjustified taxation, being equivalent to an
expropriation of those funds.”

 

Finally, Claimant informs the Tribunal that it made an application to the European Court of
Human Rights (ECHR) in 2009, complaining about arbitrariness of and discrimination by
Albanian court decisions because “[t]he Supreme Court has decided that this case enters
within the administrative jurisdiction, so denying the applicant to receive a fair trial by a
civil tribunal” .™*° The ECHR has not yet dealt with the application and has not served it on
Albania.”

6.2.4.2 Respondent’s position

Respondent first refuted Claimant’s claim “of nothing more than a 5-line paragraph in the
Memorial” as unspecific and unsubstantiated.*“*

It later developed its position by arguing that Claimant’s assertions are unfounded because
they do not meet the generally acknowledged high standard for a successful claim for
denial of justice, which comprises two considerations: “First is the fact that the fair and
equitable treatment standard is not an invitation to tribunals to review or to second-
guess decisions made by host State courts. Second is the fact that a State’s liability for
breaching the fair and equitable treatment standard by denying justice to an investor
will only be engaged if and when all remedies within the relevant judicial system have
been exhausted”.>”

In addition to the arbitral awards cited by Claimant, Respondent relies on several other
arbitral awards in support of these two considerations.

Citing Arif v. Moldova, Respondent reiterates the warning that “international tribunals
must refrain from playing the role of ultimate appellate courts. They cannot substitute their
own application and interpretation of national law to the application by national
courts”.

Respondent insists that it is generally accepted that the threshold for denial of justice is
high and subjected to “an extreme test”.>°! This standard is only met when the incriminated
court decision is “clearly improper and discreditable” and “displays ‘a wilful disregard of
due process of law, [...] which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial
°° 552 when “the judiciary breached the standard by fundamentally unfair

proceedings and outrageously wrong, final and binding decisions” >

propriety

As to the second consideration, Respondent relies on Arif v. Moldova, where the tribunal
held that “as long as the judicial system is not tested as a whole, the fair and equitable
standard is not violated via a denial of justice [...]. The State is not responsible for the

which are capable of neutralizing such judge.

Respondent contends, in applying the standard, the decisions of the Supreme Court and the
Constitutional Court of Albania have not denied justice to Claimant. On the contrary, when
the Supreme Court overturned the decision of a first instance court that had accepted to
hear a claim for the reimbursement of allegedly overpaid tax duties, it strictly applied
Albanian law. According to Respondent, the Supreme Court correctly found that the claim
was not ripe because Claimant had failed to follow the mandatory procedures of Article
249 of the Customs Code, according to which administrative procedures necessarily
precede civil court proceedings. Respondent relies on the detailed legal expert opinion by
Mr. Viktor Gumi. Along with Mr. Gumi, Respondent rejects Claimant’s legal expert
opinion of Prof. Dr. Mariana Semini, who opined that Claimant had a choice to bring either
a civil law claim for unjust enrichment before the civil courts or a tax claim before the
administrative courts.

Respondent further contends that the Constitutional Court correctly rejected Claimant’s
claim because it found that the Supreme Court had not violated any constitutional
provision and had correctly applied the law.

Respondent finally asserts that Claimant has not exhausted national Albanian remedies. As
indicated by the Supreme Court, it is still free to follow the appropriate administrative
proceedings before bringing the claim to the courts.

6.2.4.3 The Determination of the Tribunal

The Tribunal confirms — in agreement with generally accepted jurisprudence and doctrine,
which is not contested by the Parties — that a claim for denial of justice must not be
confounded with an appeal against decisions of national judiciary. The Tribunal is not a
super-appellate court. It has no competence to muse over the question of whether the
majority of the Albanian Supreme Court was right when it overturned a decision of a first
instance court, whether the first instance court had better reasoning or whether dissenters
within the Supreme Court had the better reasoning. The Tribunal is also not a super-
constitutional court with competence to correct the Albanian Constitutional Court’s
application of the Albanian constitution. As correctly explained by Claimant, the standard
of denial of justice in international law does not protect against possibly wrong decisions

stem to provide

The Tribunal has studied the cited decision of the Supreme Court, the first instance
decision and the decision of the Constitutional Court, as well as the opinions of the legal
experts, who were not called for cross-examination during the hearing. The Tribunal
understands that Albania — like many other civil law countries — distinguishes between
civil courts and administrative courts. It further understands that in situations where a
private physical or legal person complains under public law about the conduct and
decisions of the administration, it has to address its claim first — again like in many other
civil law countries — to the administrative body and its hierarchy. In Albania — again like in
many other countries — tax law is part of the body of public law.

In the domestic proceedings, Claimant labeled its claim for the reimbursement of allegedly
overpaid tax duties as a claim for unjust enrichment under the Civil Code. The court of first
instance and the dissenting minority in the Supreme Court found that the claim was a civil
law claim. The majority of the Supreme Court found that Claimant was not free to label its
claim in this way, qualified the claim as a public law claim under the Customs Code, and
decided that the mandatory pre-trial administrative procedure contained in the Customs
Code was applicable. It went on to dismiss the claim because Claimant had not respected
this procedure. The Constitutional Court did not find a violation of the constitution based
on this series of events.

Claimant’s legal expert opined that the Supreme Court’s decision surprisingly deviated
from previous case law according to which Claimant would have had an option of bringing
the claim either before the civil court without a pre-trial administrative procedure, or
before the administrative courts. She has not provided case materials in support of this
opinion. In her view, the Supreme Court has denied Claimant justice. Respondent’s legal
expert has opined that an option exists only under specific circumstances and that these
circumstances are not met in the case at hand. He opined that the Supreme Court applied
the law correctly and produced another decision of the Supreme Court that confirms this
opinion. In his view, the Supreme Court has not denied justice and has acted in strict
application of the law.

The Tribunal deems that it is not its role to make a final judgment over the disputed
Albanian legal questions. Both legal experts have given reasoned opinions. The Supreme
Court was divided over the correct answers. Both the majority and the dissenting minority
have presented reasons for their decision and opinion. It is not the Tribunal’s role to take

sides. It has also not been given evidence to determine whether the Supreme Court
deviated from former court practice.

However, a review of the material before it and a careful reading of the Supreme Court’s
decision enabled the Tribunal to conclude that it is not clearly improper, discreditable or in
shocking disregard of Albanian law. The judgment is reasoned, understandable, coherent
and embedded in a legal system that is characterized by a division between public and
private law as well as civil and administrative procedures.

Therefore, the Tribunal rejects the claim for denial of justice.

Having dealt with all asserted sub-heads of claim under the FET standard, the Tribunal
summarizes its finding by stating that Respondent has not violated its duty to provide fair
and equitable treatment.

6.3 Unreasonable and Discriminatory Measures

The Albanian-Greek BIT does not provide for compensation against unreasonable and
discriminatory measures.

Claimant bases its claim in this respect on Article 10.1 of the ECT, which provides that:

.. no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures
their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal.

As mentioned, Respondent has not objected to Claimant’s reliance on the ECT as a basis
for its claims and has answered in substance to Claimant’s assertions. At the same time, it
has taken the view that the ECT does not protect Claimant’s investment because that
investment is illegal.>*°

Having determined that the latter question is one of merits, the Tribunal will, based on the
Parties’ positions, determine whether Respondent violated its obligation not to impair
Claimant’s investment by unreasonable and discriminatory measures as formulated in
Article 10.1 of the ECT.

6.3.1 Claimant’s position

Claimant asserts that the standard is closely connected to the FET standard and that it is
sufficient for a breach of obligation to occur when the measure is either unreasonable or
discriminatory. Measures are unreasonable when “they do not serve a rational purpose or

55° Resp. C-Mem., para. 290.

148

are disproportionate” and are discriminatory when they treat a foreign investor and (local)
competitors unequally.”

777. Claimant relies on Saluka v. Czech Republic, where the tribunal found:

The standard of ‘reasonableness’ has no different meaning in this context than in the context
of the “fair and equitable treatment” standard with which it is associated; and the same is
true with regard to the standard of ‘non-discrimination’. The standard of ‘reasonableness’
therefore requires, in this context as well, a showing that the State’s conduct bears a reasonable
relationship to some rational policy, whereas the standard of ‘non-discrimination’ requires a
rational justification of any differential treatment of a foreign investor.**

 

778. Claimant alleges a significant violation of the standard by three distinct measures.

779. Firstly, Claimant contends that Respondent taxed the import of petroleum products
unreasonably by assessing fictitious quantities in accordance with the bill of lading and not
with the accurate shore outturn quantities. The difference in quantity is between | and 2%.
This practice contradicted European law and international practice. Claimant suffered great
material losses, repeatedly complained about this illegal practice and finally brought the
dispute to Albanian courts where its valid claims were rejected.°°°

780. Secondly, Respondent acted unreasonably and discriminatorily when it closed the port of
Durres. The measure was not taken in pursuit of a rational public purpose; it was not meant
to shut down the tank farm to build a container terminal, as Respondent contends, but was
in fact aimed at favoring a local competitor and was taken to force tankers to unload in the
new oil terminal in Porto Romano.°

781. Thirdly, Respondent acted unreasonably and discriminatorily when, beginning in 2008, it
allowed local refineries and traders to sell lower quality diesel on the market than that
which international traders were allowed to sell. The measure favoured the sole local
refinery, which was in the process of privatization. The Constitutional Court invalidated
the measure because it created a monopoly to the detriment of other operators.*°!

6.3.2. Respondent’s position

782. Respondent refutes Claimant’s arguments as completely unsubstantiated, confused and
unsupported by evidence. Claimant does not elucidate what taxes were overpaid, does not
document any of the payments, evaluates the alleged damages at 1.4 million Euros at times

and at 360,000 Euros at others, and suggests at the same time that the claims have already
been “secured”.°”

783. Respondent contends further that the State has the sovereign power to decide on taxation
and is not bound either by international practice or by European Directives, since Albania
is not a member of the EU."

784. With respect to the closing of the port of Durres for ships, Respondent has consistently
asserted that it was the implementation of a long-standing policy decision that strictly
served the public interest and did not privilege any competitor.

785. With respect to the diesel quality measures, Respondent alleges that they were only in
force for 6 months until their invalidation by the Albanian Constitutional Court. Claimant
has not proven that they significantly impaired its investment in such short period.
Claimant’s allegations are unsubstantiated in liability and damage. In addition, according
to Respondent, the measure was reasonable and not discriminatory. The Constitutional
Court did not find otherwise, because the invalidation was based on the fact that only a law
could introduce the resulting restriction of economic freedom and not — as was the case — a
Decision of the Council of Ministers.°°*

6.3.3 The Determination of the Tribunal

786. The Tribunal understands that the imposition of import taxes based on fictitious amounts in
bills of lading, and not on quantities actually discharged, favours the State over the
taxpayer. It is not in line with international practice and contradicts a European Directive.
In fact, one of the tasks of the EU Customs Assistance Mission to Albania was to bring the
Albanian customs regime closer to European and international standards.

787. The Tribunal notes however that Albania is not an EU Member State and is therefore not
bound by EU law. Further, the head of the EU Mission to Albania confirmed in 2005 that
the customs authorities “can legally use six different methods to calculate the value of
goods for custom purposes” °° The fact that a tax is based on fictitious amounts is not
unusual in tax law. The practice was already in place when Claimant started investing. The
legal system might have been outdated and one-sided, oriented to favor the generation of
tax revenues. That is a problem to be addressed in the reform of tax policy. If the State
defines reasonableness of the tax law by the maximization of revenue, it is entitled to do

so. The approach does not amount to unlawfulness under international law, and the
Tribunal has no authority to replace the State’s policy rationale by its own.

The measure was also not discriminatory because it was evenly applied to all importers.
The fact that some importers tried to circumvent it by falsifying the bill of lading does not
change this conclusion.

If Claimant believes to have overpaid taxes under Albanian law, the proper remedy would
have been to bring claims under Albanian law before the administrative authorities and
courts. According to Claimant’s witness Kyriakos Mamidakis, this is, indeed, what
Claimant did. He testified that “[mJost of these cases (on extra tax and customs
obligations) have been brought to the court and decided in our favor’ > The Tribunal has
no competence to hear these claims as long as justice is not denied, and the Tribunal has
found that this was not the case.

For these reasons, the Tribunal holds that the tax measures do not amount to an
unreasonable or discriminatory measure under international law.

With respect to the closing of the port of Durres to petroleum tankers, the Tribunal has
already developed its opinion that the State’s conduct bore a reasonable relationship to
some rational policy. The rationality was not animated by plans to build a container
terminal but by the desire to implement a rational master plan for the port of Durres as part
of a general transport sector strategy. The government’s intention to re-orient tankers to
Porto Romano is not an expression of irrationality but fits into the overall rationality of that
policy. Finally, the closure did not favour a local competitor because it concerned all
importers of petroleum products.

For these reasons, the Tribunal holds that the closing of the port of Durres does not amount
to an unreasonable or discriminatory measure under international law.

With respect to the changes of the diesel quality, whose standards the Albanian
Government gradually raised, the Tribunal accepts that the measure was driven by rational
policy decisions.

While Decision No. 147, dated 21 March 2007, reduced the sulfur content of diesel to 10
mg/kg from 1 January 2011,°°’ Decision No. 1110 dated 30 July 2008 extended the period
for this obligation for diesel that was refined in Albania from “crude oil, extracted from the
sources within the Republic of Albania” and marketed in Albania, by one year, until 1
January 2012.5 Decision No. 52 dated 14 January 2009 abrogated Decision No. 1110 and

replaced most of its content specifying that only one local refinery, AMRO S.A.°° would
benefit from the temporary alleviations under certain conditions. At the same time, AMRO
was authorized to refine and market a lower diesel quality until 31 December 2009, which
other operators were not allowed to import. During that period, AMRO was privatized. The
Constitutional Court determined that the special regime for AMRO restricted free access to
markets as promised by Albania in the Stabilization and Association Agreement with the
European Union, and restricted the economic freedom of competitors, which could only be
done by law. It invalidated Decision No. 52 by a decision dated 24 July 2009.5”

The Tribunal finds the government’s policy to reduce the sulfur content in diesel gradually
to be rational and reasonable. It also accepts that the decision to distinguish temporarily
between international traders and the local trader marketing refined Albanian diesel bears
the rationality of often-practiced industrial policy. The government’s decision allowed the
refinery of national crude oil, which operated under the ancien régime, to adapt to modern
market conditions and competition. The Tribunal presumes that the Government was
motivated by the intention to save a traditional national industry and employment. Such a
policy, not unique to Albania, bears some rationality and is reasonable as long as the period
of transition is relatively short, thus ensuring that the national privilege takes the interests
of international competitors into consideration. It is noteworthy in this context that the final
conditions were established by the proper functioning of the Albanian legal system, namely
by checks and balances between the executive and the judiciary.

In the present case, the Albanian Government had decided to grant the local refinery
temporary protection from international competition for one year. By decision of the
Constitutional Court, this period was reduced to six months. The Tribunal believes that
such a period is neither extravagant nor unreasonable. Although it prejudiced all
international fuel operators for a short time, the Tribunal holds that, in the Albanian
context, such a situation does not exceed the limits of acceptability.

The measure concerned all traders that did not operate a refinery at the same time.
Similarly situated competitors were thus treated equally. The differing treatment was owed
to AMRO’s activity of refining locally extracted crude oil. The Tribunal holds that the
differentiation was rational for a short period and does not amount to discrimination under
international law.

The Tribunal therefore holds that Respondent’s measures to calculate customs on
quantities indicated in the bills of lading as provided by law, to close the port of Durres for
tankers and to temporarily privilege a local refinery by differentiating between diesel
qualities have not reached the level of unreasonableness and discrimination under

international law. Accordingly, Respondent did not violate its obligation under Article
10.1 of the ECT.

6.4 The Provision of Most Constant Protection and Security

9. The Albanian-Greek BIT does not provide for recovery against the failure to provide
protection and security.

S

. Claimant bases its claim on Article 10.1 of the ECT, which provides that “investments
shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security”.

Respondent has not objected to Claimant’s reliance on the ECT as a basis for its claims,

and has answered in substance to Claimant’s assertions. At the same time, it has taken the

view that the ECT does not protect Claimant’s investment which was made is illegal.°”!

N

Having determined that the latter question is one of merits, the Tribunal will, based on the
Parties’ positions, determine whether Respondent violated its obligation to provide the
most constant protection and security to Claimant’s investment, as formulated in Article
10.1 of the ECT.

6.4.1 Claimant’s position

a

Claimant contends that “Respondent deprived Claimant’s investment of the necessary
protection and security by failing to enforce its legal framework, especially regarding
fuel smuggling, tax evasion and fuel adulteration.”

z

It asserts that the standard extends beyond mere physical safety and security and that “the
protection required must be broader.” It relies on Vivendi v. Argentina II, where the
tribunal found:

If the parties to the BIT had intended to limit the obligation to ‘physical interferences’,
they could have done so by including words to that effect in the section. In the absence of such
words of limitation, the scope of the Article 5(1) protection should be interpreted to apply to
reach any act or measure which deprives an investor’s investment of protection and full
security, providing, in accordance with the Treaty’s specific wording, the act or measure also
constitutes unfair and inequitable treatment. Such actions or measures need not threaten physical
possession or the legally protected terms of operation of the investment.*”*

Claimant acknowledges that fuel smuggling and quality adulteration already existed when
it invested but contends that the situation worsened from 2003 since the Government was
incompetent and unwilling to make serious efforts to combat it. Formal adherence to
international organizations and institutions did not change the practice in substance.
Respondent recognized these facts in theory but nevertheless let the events occur. It is
common knowledge that officials above the ministerial level were implicated in smuggling
and adulteration and enriched themselves. They allowed local competitors to declare fuel
as being in transit, when in reality they sold it on the local market or declared lower
quantities and qualities. Both schemes were common and used to avoid taxes.

 

According to Claimant, repeated requests to improve the situation by concrete measures of
control and prohibition of certain practices, such as loading fuel from vessels to trucks,
remained unanswered, and even the EU Customs Assistance Mission endorsed the illegal
practices that gave rise to smuggling. In its 2004 Report on the Stabilization and
Association Agreement, the EU acknowledged that “smuggling and trafficking continues to
be a serious problem”.> 74

All of these actions allegedly caused serious distortion to the fuel market and led to
significant losses to honest operators like Claimant.°”>

6.4.2 Respondent’s position

Respondent refutes Claimant’s arguments on law and on fact. It insists that

[i]t is an undisputed principle under international law that the obligation to provide full
protection and security is not absolute, and does not imply a strict liability on behalf of the host
State. Indeed, a significant number of international tribunals have considered that customary
law merely requires the State to exercise due diligence under the standard of protection and
security, explicitly rejecting the application of strict liability. Importantly, the standard does
not protect foreign investments against every possible loss of value that may occur.*”°

Respondent relies on Tecmed v. Mexico, where the tribunal found that “the guarantee of
full protection and security is not absolute and does not impose strict liability upon the
State that grants it?” and on Electrabel v. Hungary, where the tribunal, referring to El
Paso v. Argentina where the tribunal held:

The case-law and commentators generally agree that this standard imposes an obligation of
vigilance and due diligence upon the government. [...] It should be emphasised that the
obligation to show “due diligence” does not mean that the State has to prevent each and every
injury. Rather, the obligation is generally understood as requiring that the State take reasonable
actions within its power to avoid injury when it is, or should be, aware that there is a risk of
injury. The precise degree of care, of what is “reasonable” or “due,” depends in part on the
circumstances. *”*

  

810. In addition, Respondent asserts that the standard concerns primarily the physical integrity
of an investment. It refers to Saluka v. Czech Republic, where the tribunal held that it is
essentially limited to cases in which “the foreign investment has been affected by civil
strife and physical violence”, and is “not meant to cover just any kind of impairment of an
investor’s investment, but to protect more specifically the physical integrity of an
investment against interference by use of force” >”

811. In applying the standard to the present case, Respondent alleges that Claimant was fully
aware that Respondent was “emerging from economic chaos and facing considerable
challenges”**° when it made its investment. Further, Claimant’s decision to suspend and
then abandon its plans to develop its own retail network was apparently not influenced by
the smuggling and related activities because it was taken in 2001, whereas Claimant started
to complain about smuggling in 2003. Finally, Claimant paid 1 million USD in 2006 to
acquire the minority participation in its Albanian subsidiary “which does not give rise to
the slightest suggestion of a business crippled because of a ‘distorted fuel market vr 581

812. Moreover, Claimant has not alleged physical harassment by State authorities or third

parties. For the purposes of the full protection and security, it is not enough to claim to

813. Respondent does not deny that smuggling and related activities were serious problems in
Albania as well as in the neighboring countries and in the region. However, it claims to
have made significant, consistent and internationally coordinated efforts to combat

smuggling and tax evasion. It points to the national Customs Code that was amended in
1999 to create an Anti-Smuggling Directorate to lead the fight against smuggling. It further
points to the “Agreement on Deployment of Naval Assistance in the Customs Sector’,
concluded with Italy, which led to the reorganization of the customs department with the
assistance of the Italian “Guardia di Financia”.**"

Respondent further requested assistance from the European Union, which deployed the
Customs Assistance Mission (CAM-A) in 1997 that helped to develop a viable and modern
customs service. CAM-A was renamed in 2006 as the EU’s “Customs and Fiscal
Assistance Office” (CAFAO). At the time it was phased out in 2008, it was internationally
acclaimed for “achieving valuable results in terms of revenue collection, prevention of
smuggling and corruption and reinforcement of the service.”>*4

Moreover, Respondent signed the “Convention of the Southeast European Law
Enforcement Center” (SELEC), where it co-chairs the “Anti-Fraud and Smuggling
Taskforce”, and created, with the assistance of UNCTAD, the national operation
ASYCUDA to combat smuggling, tax evasion and fuel adulteration.**>

Respondent contends that the various national and concerted international measures bore
fruit and were consistently praised. By 2000, CAM-A had described Albania in 2000 as
“the leading country in the region for its anti-smuggling ability and intelligence” .**° In
2006, the European Commission noted:

 

There has been significant progress in the i ini and capacity
for customs. In 2005 the Customs Administration collected 108% of target revenue. This
positive trend was confirmed in the first half of 2006. [...] Some progress can be reported as

regards the customs service’s role in fighting organised crime, drugs and smuggling. The
Customs maritime branch is being reactivated and some patrol boats have entered into service.
Cooperation between police and customs has been strengthened and several effective actions
have taken place. A joint force with the police is now operational.°*’

Likewise, in 2013 the British ambassador confirmed after a visit to Durres that he was
“impressed with what I have seen of the arrangements at Durres for port security, customs
and immigration controls” 5%

Respondent concludes that “the Republic of Albania has made all reasonable efforts to
combat smuggling and tax evasion in the Albanian market and has in any event largely

satisfied its due diligence obligation under international law”. Respondent has purportedly
protected and secured Claimant’s investments, as well as those of other importers, under
difficult circumstances and despite its limited resources. The fact that it uncovered a petrol
fraud scheme is a further demonstration of its diligence. In these circumstances, there can
be no successful claim against Respondent since the standard is not one of strict liability.>

6.4.3 The Determination of the Tribunal

The Tribunal first notes that the obligation to provide constant protection and security must
not be confounded with the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment. The
distinction between the standards in treaties such as the ECT is of relevance. It would
violate the principles of treaty interpretation under the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties to confuse the meaning of protection and security with that of a fair and equitable
treatment.

The Tribunal concludes therefore that both claims have to be examined separately. The fact
that the Tribunal rejected the FET claim does not imply the rejection of the claim for a
violation of protection and security.

The Tribunal refers to a jurisprudence constante according to which the standard of
constant protection and security does not imply strict liability but rather obliges States to
use due diligence to prevent harassment and injuries to investors. The measure of due
diligence is conditioned by the circumstances. The Tribunal further concurs with
Electrabel v. Hungary that due diligence does not oblige the State to “prevent each and
every injury”.

When applying these delimiting principles to the facts of the case, the Tribunal finds that
Respondent has not violated its duty under international law to use the due diligence that it
was able to use under the specific circumstances to protect and secure Claimant’s
investment.

The Tribunal is conscious of the fact, which Respondent does not contest, that smuggling,
fuel adulteration and tax evasion were serious problems in Albania as well as in the region
at the time when Claimant made its investment. Claimant acknowledges that it was aware
of this situation. It was part of the general business environment and investment conditions.
Claimant decided to make its investment under these conditions of insecurity. Smuggling,
fuel adulteration and tax evasion existed prior to the investment, and therefore were not
specific to Claimant’s investment. It is therefore not correct to allege that the problem
distorted the conditions of the investment after it has been made.

157

824.

826.

827.

General insecurity was also a consequence of weak government structures and institutions
at the time of the investment. Albania was confronted with the general duty to confirm
itself as a State and build efficient institutions to combat criminality in general and
smuggling, fuel adulteration and tax evasion in particular. This is all the more so since the
incriminated activities particularly prejudiced Respondent itself. In fact, the Tribunal has
some difficulty in understanding in what way tax evasion by third parties injured
Claimant’s investment at all. While Claimant might have been entitled to expect that the
general conditions of insecurity would improve over time, it was not entitled to expect that
Respondent would protect its investment against the general insecurity that was inherent to
the investment climate as opposed to specific instances of harassment.

In this regard, Claimant submits that the situation deteriorated after 2003. It has presented
the expertise of the private consultant AIOG that states that fuel smuggling and fuel
adulteration increased after 2003, though it has not presented any evidence to support this
statement. AIOG further states that the fuel market in Albania as a whole increased
considerably after 2000 and that the quantity of imported fuel increased considerably
during this period.°”° The latter statement corresponds to the statements made by both
Parties’ experts on damages. They confirm that Claimant’s sales of diesel and other
petroleum products increased considerably after 2001.°°! AIOG has not indicated in what
way the alleged increase in smuggling was related to the general increase of consumption
and imports or how it prejudiced Claimant as well as other importers, particularly as they
were able to increase their market share. The Tribunal is not fully convinced by AIOG’s
opinion.

Moreover, in addition to increasing its market share, Claimant increased the import of fuel.
It decided in 2006 to buy the minority participation for a considerable price even if the
buy-out was to clear the way for an international listing. Given these facts, the Tribunal has
difficulty in ascertaining how smuggling and related activities caused injury to Claimant.

Further, Respondent has described an impressive number of nationally and internationally
coordinated efforts to combat smuggling, fuel adulteration and tax evasion. It has provided
enough evidence to convince the Tribunal that the policy pursued with these measures was
consistent and seriously targeted. The Tribunal has read reports and statements from
international agencies and observers who attested serious efforts and improvements. In this
connection, Claimant has indicated that one of these institutions, the EU Customs
Assistance Mission, endorsed illegal practices giving rise to smuggling. The Tribunal does
not accept this insinuation as true, particularly as it is not evidenced.

Sy

In sum, the Tribunal finds that on one hand Claimant was able to operate successfully in
Albania until the closing of the port of Durres and that in 2006, Claimant had a general
appreciation of Albanian development sufficient to convince it to invest a considerable
amount into shares; on the other hand, the Albanian Government pursued a national policy
of combatting smuggling and reached out to international partners to assist it in this
objective. Given these circumstances and the related evidence, the Tribunal accepts that
Respondent made serious efforts to overcome the serious situation of smuggling, fuel
adulteration and tax evasion that existed when Claimant made its investment.

Therefore, the Tribunal recognizes Respondent’s due diligence in its general customs
policy and in its specific measures. Under the prevailing circumstances, it has not breached
its obligation under Article 10.1 of the ECT to constantly protect and secure Claimant’s
investment.

COSTS

On 22 April 2014, Claimant submitted the final statement of its costs and expenses. They
amount to 902,603.58 Euro, including fees for legal representation, expert fees and costs of
travel, translation and courier services.

On 22 April 2014, Respondent likewise submitted its final statement of costs and expenses.
They amount to 528,453.40 Euro, including fees and expenses of external and internal
counsel, expert fees and costs of travel and translation.

Each Party seeks the reimbursement of its fees and expenses as well as the reimbursement
of the advances paid to ICSID and requests the Tribunal to make an order to this effect. In
addition, Respondent asks the Tribunal to order Claimant to pay interest at a reasonable
commercial rate as from the date of the award. Neither Party has explained why it
considers it appropriate to deviate from the provisions of Articles 9 and 10 of the BIT.

Neither Party expressed a desire to comment on the other Party’s statement of costs.”

Article 61.2 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 28 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules
mandates that the Tribunal make a decision on costs. In doing so, it has wide discretion in
its determination and allocation.

At the same time, the Tribunal notes that Article 10(2), by reference to Article (9) of the
BIT, provides that each Party shall bear the costs of the arbitrator it has appointed as well
as the costs of its representation, whereas the costs related to the chairman and other costs
are to be borne in equal parts by both Parties. The Tribunal is bound to apply these

838.

provisions of the BIT which is the applicable law in the present case. It does so with
conviction because it finds that the distribution of costs resulting from the provisions is fair
and appropriate under the circumstances.

The fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the administrative fees incurred by ICSID are
the following (in USD):

Tribunal’s Fees and Expenses

Prof. Dr. Rolf Knieper — 180,383.96
Mr. Steven A. Hammond — 292,486.97
Dr. Yas Banifatemi — 146,834.79

ICSID’s Administrative Fees — 128,000
ICSID’s Expenses — 97,284.74

By application of Article 10(2) by reference to Article (9) of the BIT, Claimant is
responsible for USD 495,321.32 and Respondent is responsible for USD 349,669.14 of the
fees and expenses.

Claimant has paid costs and fees amounting to USD 649,925 whereas Respondent has paid
costs and fees amounting to USD 199,910. Respondent must therefore reimburse Claimant
the amount of USD 149,759.14, representing the amount of Respondent’s fees and
expenses paid by Claimant.
