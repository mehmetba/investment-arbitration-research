WHEREAS on 29 September 2009, the Respondent received the Notice of Arbitration;

WHEREAS in their Notice of Arbitration, the Claimants notified the Respondent of their

WHEREAS by e-mail dated 25 March 2010, the Claimants indicated that they “anticipate
filing in the very near future a request for provisional measures that is necessary to protect
the rights of the Claimants. This request is urgent and will need to be decided quickly. We
would ask that the Tribunal add this item to the Agenda for discussion and scheduling [for
the telephone conference call of 26 March 2010.]”’;

WHEREAS during the telephone conference call of 26 March 2010, the Tribunal (i)
requested that the Claimants file their Request for Interim Measures no later than 2 April
2010, (ii) scheduled a second telephone conference call with the Parties for 9 April 2010 for
the purpose of discussing a timetable for dealing with the Claimants’ Request for Interim
Measures, and (iii) scheduled a first procedural meeting to take place on 10-11 May 2010 at
the IDRC in London, the above schedule also being set out in writing in the presiding
arbitrator's e-mail of 31 March 2010;

WHEREAS by e-mail dated 1 April 2010, the Claimants submitted their Request for Interim
Measures, with instructions for accessing exhibits and legal authorities electronically;

WHEREAS by letter dated 6 April 2010, the Respondent objected to the consideration of the
Claimants’ Request for Interim Measures and requested the cancellation of the 9 April 2010
telephone conference call;

WHEREAS by letter dated 7 April 2010, the Claimants opposed the cancellation of the 9

‘The Tribunal thanks the Parties for their participation in today’s second session held by
telephone conference-call. It is appropriate for the Tribunal to issue the following order with
immediate effect, although a formal order will follow in due course, addressing other matters
discussed at the session:

A - Interim Measures:

As regards Item I of the Agenda, the Tribunal notes the Claimant’s two cumulative
applications for interim measures: (i) the first application for interim measures made by
letter dated I April 2010, as set out in Paragraph 14 (pages 6 -7) and (ii) the second
application for interim measures made by letter dated 7 April 2010, as set out in its last
paragraph (being orally confirmed by the Claimant’s Counsel during today’s session).

The Tribunal decides that the Claimant shall be heard by the Tribunal as regards both
applications at the first procedural meeting to be held in London on 10 and 11 May 2010
subject to further order, including directions as to procedure applicable before and during
that meeting (e.g., as to the former, the Respondent's written answer to such applications, in
whole or in part, and the Claimant's written reply before the meeting).

The Tribunal currently intends that such directions shall be made in the light of the
Respondent's further letter regarding the Claimant's applications (to be received by the
Tribunal as soon as practicable but no later than Friday, 16 April 2010) and any written
response thereto by the Claimant, as directed by the Tribunal. [...].’

WHEREAS by letter dated 15 April 2010, the Respondent provided further comments
regarding the Claimants’ Request for Interim Measures, including a procedural proposal for
the adjudication of the Request;

WHEREAS by letter dated 16 April 2010, the Claimants responded to the procedural
proposal put forward by the Respondent;

WHEREAS by letter dated 23 April 2010, the Respondent requested clarification from the
Tribunal on the agenda for the meeting in London on 10-11 May 2010;

WHEREAS on 27 April 2010, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order as follows:

‘I. Further to the Tribunal’s Procedural Order dated 9 April 2010, the Tribunal has
considered the Respondent's letter dated 15 April, the Claimants’ letter dated 16 April and
the Respondent's letter dated 23 April 2010.

2. The Tribunal confirms that the Claimants’ two applications for interim measures, namely:

(i) the first application for interim measures made by the Claimants’ letter dated
1 April 2010, as set out in paragraph 14 (pages 6-7), and

(ii) the second application for interim measures made by the Claimants’ letter
dated 7 April 2010 (as set out in its last paragraph),

shall be heard at the first procedural meeting to be held at the IDRC, 70 Fleet Street, London
ECY 1EV on 10 and 11 May 2010, beginning at 0930 hours on the first of these two days.

3. The Tribunal considers that the most immediate issue for this meeting lies in the
Respondent's submission that “no urgency exists here” (as set out in the Respondent's letter
dated 15 April 2010, at pages 3-4) and the Claimants’ submission to the contrary (as set out
in its letters dated I & 7 April 2010).

4. The Parties are requested to address this issue at the meeting, as well as any other related
issue. To that end, in regard to such issue(s), the Respondent is requested to submit a written
response to the Claimants’ applications by 3 May 2010, to which the Claimants are
requested to respond in writing by 7 May 2010.

5. Subject to further order, the meeting will begin with the Claimants’ oral submissions in the
morning of the first day (not to exceed 2.5 hours), to be followed by the Respondent's oral
submissions in the afternoon (not to exceed 2.5 hours). On the second day, the Claimants and
the Respondent may make oral submissions in reply (not to exceed 1.5 hours each).

6. Either at the end of the first day or in the afternoon of the second day (to be determined at
the meeting), the Tribunal will address, in further consultation with the Parties, outstanding
procedural matters, including the future procedural timetable, possibly based on different
contingencies.’

WHEREAS by e-mails dated 3 May 2010, the Respondent submitted its Response to the
Request for Interim Measures and its Summary Description of Preliminary Jurisdictional and
Admissibility Objections;

WHEREAS by e-mails dated 7 May 2010, the Claimants submitted their Reply on Interim
Measures;

WHEREAS the meeting on interim measures and procedural matters was held in London on
10-11 May 2010, as recorded in the verbatim transcripts of that meeting (in English and
Spanish);

WHEREAS the Tribunal considered the Parties’ several written and oral submissions;
THE TRIBUNAL ORDERS AS FOLLOWS:

1. Until further decision the Tribunal takes, pursuant to Article 26(1) of the UNCITRAL
Rules, the following interim measures up to and including the next procedural meeting
beginning on 22 November 2010:

(i) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered to maintain, as far as possible
the status quo and not to exacerbate the procedural and substantive disputes before
this Tribunal, including (in particular but without limiting howsoever the generality
of the foregoing) the avoidance of any public statement tending to compromise these
arbitration proceedings;

(ii) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered to refrain from any conduct
likely to impair or otherwise adversely affect, directly or indirectly, the ability of the
Tribunal to address fairly any issue raised by the Parties before this Tribunal;

(iii) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered not to exert, directly or
indirectly, any unlawful influence or pressure on the Court addressing the pending
litigation in Ecuador known as the Lago Agrio Case;

(iv) The Claimants and the Respondent are ordered to inform the Tribunal (in
writing) of the likely date for the issue by the Court of its judgment in the Lago Agrio
Case as soon as such date becomes known to any of them;

(v) The Respondent is ordered to communicate (in writing and also by any other
appropriate means) the Tribunal’s invitation to the Court in the Lago Agrio Case to
make known as a professional courtesy to the Tribunal the likely date for the issue by
the Court of its judgment in the Lago Agrio Case; and, to that end, the Respondent is
ordered to send to the Court the full text in Spanish and English of the Tribunal’s
present order; and

(vi) The Respondent is ordered to facilitate and not to discourage, by every
appropriate means, the Claimants’ engagement of legal experts, advisers and
representatives from the Ecuadorian legal profession for the purpose of these
arbitration proceedings (at the Claimants’ own expense).

2. This Order is and shall remain subject to modification in the light of any future event, upon
the Tribunal’s own motion or upon any Party's application, particularly in the light of any
new development in the Lago Agrio Case and the issue of the Court’s judgement in such

5

Case; and any of the Parties may apply to the Tribunal for such modification upon 24 hours’
written notice.

3. This Order is made strictly without prejudice to the merits of the Parties’ procedural and
b ive dis including the Ri dent’s jurisdictional and admissibility obj

and the merits of the Claimants’ claims.”

(I) THE ORDER OF 28 JANUARY 2011

WHEREAS: The Tribunal made the following procedural order dated 28 January 2011:

“WHEREAS the Tribunal received (i) the Claimants’ letter dated 12 December 2010 with
their application for a “brief order” stating the Tribunal’s determination that it has
jurisdiction over the Parties’ dispute and establishing “a schedule for the merits procedure”
(at page 13, paragraph 2, here called the “First Application”); (ii) under the Tribunal’s
order of 17 December 2010, the Respondent’s letter dated 31 December 2010 opposing the
Claimants’ First Application; (iii) the Claimants’ first letter dated 14 January 2011
responding to the Respondent’s letter dated 31 December 2010 as regards the First
Application; (iv) the Claimants’ second letter dated 14 January 2011 with their revised
application for interim measures (at pages 15-16, paragraphs (1) to (6), here called the
“Second Application” and set out as Annex A hereto); (v) the Respondent's letter dated 18
January 2011 applying for an extension of time to 21 January 2011 for its written response to
the Claimants’ first letter dated 14 January 2011 regarding the First Application and an
extension to 14 February 2011 for its written response to the Claimants’ second letter dated
14 January 2011 regarding the Second Application; (vi) the Claimants’ letter dated 19
January 2011 opposing the Respondent's application for an extension of time in regard to the
Second Application beyond 28 January 2011 and requesting an immediate and provisional
order pending the Tribunal’s determination of their Second Application; and (vii) under the
Tribunal’s order of 20 January 2011, the Respondent's letter dated 21 January

201 Iresponding to the Claimants’ first letter dated 14 January 2011 regarding the First
Application;

WHEREAS the Tribunal heard the Parties’ legal representatives at a procedural meeting
(held by telephone conference-call) on 26 January 2011, the contents of which were recorded
and shall be transcribed presently, as regards the procedure required to address both the
Claii ’ Second Application and the R dent's ition to this Second Application;

WHEREAS during this procedural meeting, the Claimants indicated that the Tribunal should
determine their Second Application urgently without any oral hearing (i.e., on the Parties’
written submissions and other materials already before the Tribunal submitted in these
arbitration proceedings); the Respondent opposed such procedure and indicated that it

requested an oral hearing preceded by an opportunity to make its written submissions

the Second Application; and the Clai indi d that if their Second
Application could not be determined by the Tribunal timeously, the Claimants requested an
immediate “temporary order” in like terms pending such determination; and

 

WHEREAS the Tribunal is continuing to deliberate and decide upon its jurisdiction to decide
the Parties’ dispute in these arbitration proceedings, following the Parties’ many oral and
written submissions on such disputed jurisdiction; and

NOTING the Claimants’ concerns as to the imminent expectation of an adverse judgment
made in the pending litigation in Ecuador known as the Lago Agrio Case, in a substantial
monetary amount, following the Lago Agrio Court’s confirmation of its autos para sentencia
on 29 December 2010;

NOTING the Claimants’ further concerns as to immediate attempts thereafter to enforce such
judgment by the Lago Agrio plaintiffs (within and without Ecuador), potentially rendering
these arbitration proceedings inefficacious and, if not thereby thwarting the Claimants’
claims against the Respondent, causing loss to the Claimants not compensatable in damages
payable by the Respondent; and

NOTING the R dent's ition to the Claii ’ Second Application on the ground
(inter alia) that the Respondent is not a party to the Lago Agrio Case; that no adverse
judgment is necessarily imminent even after the Lago Agrio Court’s autos para sentencia;
that the Claimants have indicated that they will appeal any adverse judgment of the Lago
Agrio Court; that, under Ecuadorian law, judgments entered in a domestic proceeding are
not enforceable during the pendency of a first-instance appeal until that appeal has been
decided; and that the Claimants cannot establish that a foreign court would agree to
recognize and enforce an Ecuadorian judgment that is not final and enforceable under the
laws of Ecuador;

THE TRIBUNAL NOW DECIDES:

(4) The Respondent shall submit its written submissions in response to the Claimants’
Second Application as soon as practicable but no later than 1700 hours (Netherlands time)
on Friday, 4 February 2011 (or such other date as may be ordered by the Tribunal);

(B) There shall be an oral hearing on the Claimants’ Second Application and the
Respondent's opposition thereto at the Peace Palace, The Hague, provisionally on Sunday, 6
February 2011 (or such other date as may be ordered by the Tribunal) at a time and ina
form to be decided later by the Tribunal;

(C) _ Pending such oral hearing or further order (on application by any Party or by the
Tribunal upon its own initiative), the Tribunal takes the following interim measures pursuant
to Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules:

1. The Tribunal re-confirms Paragraphs I(i) to (iv) of its Order dated 14 May 2010 (as
amended); namely:

(i) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered to maintain, as far as possible
the status quo and not to exacerbate the procedural and substantive disputes before
this Tribunal, including (in particular but without limiting howsoever the generality
of the foregoing) the avoidance of any public statement tending to compromise these
arbitration proceedings;

(ii) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered to refrain from any conduct
likely to impair or otherwise adversely affect, directly or indirectly, the ability of the
Tribunal to address fairly any issue raised by the Parties before this Tribunal;

(iii) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered not to exert, directly or
indirectly, any unlawful influence or pressure on the Court addressing the pending
litigation in Ecuador known as the Lago Agrio Case;

(iv) The Claimants and the Respondent are ordered to inform the Tribunal (in
writing) of the likely date for the issue by the Court of its judgment in the Lago Agrio
Case as soon as such date becomes known to any of them;

2. Whilst the Lago Agrio plaintiffs are not named parties to these arbitration proceedings and
the Respondent is not a named party to the Lago Agrio Case, the Tribunal records that, as a
matter of international law, a State may be responsible for the conduct of its organs,
including its judicial organs, as expressed in Chapter II of Part One of the International Law
Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility;

3. If it were established that any judgment made by an Ecuadorian court in the Lago Agrio
Case was a breach of an obligation by the Respondent owed to the Claimants as a matter of
international law, the Tribunal records that any loss arising from the enforcement of such
judgment (within and without Ecuador) may be losses for which the Respondent would be
responsible to the Claimants under international law, as expressed in Part Two of the
International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility; and

4. This order for further interim measures is made by the Tribunal strictly without prejudice
to any Party’s case as regards the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the Claimants’ First and Second
Applications, the Respondent's opposition to these First and Second Applications and any
claim or defence by any Party as to the merits of the Parties’ dispute.”

(II) THE ORDER OF 9 FEBRUARY 2011

WHEREAS: The Tribunal made the following procedural order dated 9 February 2011:

“WHEREAS, the Tribunal issued its order for interim measures on 28 January 2011,
providing (inter alia) for an oral hearing on 6 February 2011 at the Peace Palace, The
Hague, the Netherlands on the Claimants’ Second Application for Revised Interim Measures
made by letter dated 14 January 2011;

WHEREAS, by letter dated I February 2011, the Respondent declared its intention not to
make written submissions on the Claimants’ Second Application in accordance with
Paragraph A of the Tribunal’s order of 26 January 2011;

WHEREAS, by e-mail message dated I February 2011, the Respondent submitted to the
Tribunal a copy of the civil complaint filed earlier that same day by the First Claimant
(Chevron Corporation) in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York
against several named defendants comprising (inter alios) the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and their
legal representatives (but not including the Respondent) for damages and injunctive relief
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, entitled “Chevron Corporation v Steven R. Donziger, et al.” (for
convenience, here called the “RICO action”);

WHEREAS, by order dated 2 February 2011, after considering written submissions made by
the Parties dated 1 February and 2 February 2011, the Tribunal decided to maintain and
confirm the oral hearing on 6 February 2011;

WHEREAS, the Tribunal subsequently received the letter dated 2 February 2011 from the
President of the Chamber of the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios (copied to the
Parties) in response to the Tribunal’s letter dated 10 December 2010 regarding the likely
date of the first-instance judgment in the Lago Agrio Case, which date currently remains
uncertain but potentially imminent;

WHEREAS, on 3 February 2011, the First Claimant submitted an application to the US
District Court for the Southern District of New York in the RICO action for an order to show
cause why a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction should not be entered
against the defendants at a hearing fixed for 1400 hours on 8 February 2011, whereby the
defendants would be enjoined “...and any persons acting in concert with them from funding,
commencing, prosecuting, advancing in any way, or receiving benefit from, directly or
indirectly, any action or proceeding for recognition or enforcement of any judgment entered
against Chevron in [the Lago Agrio Case], or for prejudgment seizure or attachment of
assets based on any such judgment...”;

WHEREAS, on 6 February 2011, there was an oral hearing in the Small Court Room at the
Peace Palace commencing at 0945 hours and concluding at 1645 hours at which the Parties
made oral submissions to the Tribunal on the Claimants’ Second Application, recorded by
transcript and attended (for the Claimants) by Doak Bishop, Edward Kehoe, Caline
Mouawad, Isabel Fernandez de la Cuesta, Kristi Jacques, Elizabeth Silbert (all of King &
Spalding), James Crawford (of Matrix Chambers, by telephone from Australia); Hewitt Pate,
David Moyer and David Cohen (all of the First Claimant); and (for the Respondent) by
Alvaro Galindo Cardona (of the Procuraduria General del Estado), Zachary Douglas (of
Matrix Chambers), Eric Bloom and Ricardo Ugarte (both of Winston & Strawn);

WHEREAS, on 6 February 2011, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Tribunal continued,
until further order, Paragraph C of its order for interim measures of 26 January 2011; and

WHEREAS, on 8 February 2011, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the US District
Court for the Southern District of New York had granted that day the First Claimant’s
application in the RICO action for a temporary restraining order directing the defendants
“to temporarily refrain from taking any action to seek recognition or enforcement of a Lago
Agrio judgment”;

THE TRIBUNAL NOW DECIDES:

(A) As to jurisdiction, the Tribunal records that it has not yet determined the
Respondent's challenge to its jurisdiction (as recorded in the fourth preamble to its Order of
28 January 2011). Nonetheless, for the limited purpose of the present decision, the Tribunal
provisionally assumes that it has jurisdiction to decide upon the Claimants’ Second
Application for Interim Measures on the ground that the Claimants have established, to the
satisfaction of the Tribunal, a sufficient case for the existence of such jurisdiction at this
preliminary stage of these arbitration proceedings under the written arbitration agreement
invoked by the Claimants against the Respondent under the Treaty between the United States
of America and the Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal
Protection of Investment (the “BIT”), incorporating by reference the 1976 UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules (the “UNCITRAL Rules”);

(B) The Tribunal notes that: (i) Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules permits a tribunal, at
the request of a party, to take interim measures (established in the form of an order or
award) in respect of the subject-matter of the parties’ dispute; (ii) Article 32(1) of the
UNCITRAL Rules permits a tribunal to make (inter alia) an award in the form of a final,
partial or interim award; (iii) Article 32(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that any award
is final and binding on the parties, with the parties undertaking to carry out such award
without delay; and (iv) Articles VI.3(6) of the BIT provides (inter alia) that an award
rendered pursuant to Article VI.3(a)(iii) of the BIT under the UNCITRAL Rules shall be
binding on the parties to the dispute, with the Contracting Parties undertaking to carry out
without delay the provisions of any such award and to provide in its territory for its
enforcement;

10

(©)  Asto form, the Tribunal records that, whilst this decision under Article 26 of the
UNCITRAL Rules is made in the form of an order and not an interim award, given the
urgency required for such decision, the Tribunal may decide (upon its own initiative or any
Party’s request) to confirm such order at a later date in the form of an interim award under
Articles 26 and 32 of the UNCITRAL Rules, without the Tribunal hereby intending
conclusively to determine the status of this decision, one way or the other, as an award under
the 1958 New York Convention.

(D) As to the grounds for the Clai ’ Second Application, the Tribunal ludes that
the Claimants have made out a sufficient case, to the Tribunal’s satisfaction, under Article 26
of the UNCITRAL Rules, for the order made below in the discretionary exercise of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction to take interim measures in respect of the subject-matter of the
Parties’ dispute;

 

(E) Bearing in mind the Respondent’s several obligations under the BIT and international
law, including the Respondent’s obligation to carry out and provide for the enforcement of an
award on the merits of the Parties’ dispute in these arbitration proceedings (assuming this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction to make such an award), the Tribunal orders:

(i) the Respondent to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be
suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any judgment
against the First Claimant in the Lago Agrio Case; and

(ii) the Respondent's Government to inform this Tribunal, by the Respondent’s legal
representatives in these arbitration proceedings, of all measures which the Respondent has
taken for the implementation of this order for interim measures;

pending further order or award in these arbitration proceedings, including the Tribunal’s
award on jurisdiction or (assuming jurisdiction) on the merits;

(F) The Tribunal records that it is common ground between the Claimants and the
Respondent in these arbitration proceedings, as also re-confirmed by the Respondent at the
oral hearing on 6 February 2011 (page 107 of the English transcript and page 101 of the
Spanish transcript) that, under Ecuadorian law, a judgment entered in a domestic proceeding
at first instance (such as a first-instance judgment in the Lago Agrio Case) is not final,
conclusive or enforceable during the pendency of a first-level appeal until at least such time
as that appeal has been decided by the first-level appellate court;

(G) _ The Tribunal continues Paragraph C (1) to (3) of its order of 28 January 2011 (which
order is incorporated by reference herein);

(H) — The Tribunal decides further that the Claimants shall be legally responsible, jointly
and severally, to the Respondent for any costs or losses which the Respondent may suffer in
performing its obligations under this order, as may be decided by the Tribunal within these
arbitration proceedings (to the exclusion of any other jurisdiction);

11

() This order shall be immediately final and binding upon all Parties, subject only to any
subsequent variation made by the Tribunal (upon either its own initiative or any Party's
request); and

(JD) This order, as with the earlier order of 26 January 2011, is made by the Tribunal
strictly without prejudice to any Party’s case as regards the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the
Claimants’ First Application made by letter dated 12 December 2010, the Respondent's
opposition to such First Application, and to any claim or defence by any Party as to the
merits of the Parties’ dispute.”

(IV) THE ORDER OF 16 MARCH 2011

WHEREAS: The Tribunal made the following procedural order of 16 March 2011:

“I. The Tribunal here addresses the four disputed applications in these arbitration
proceedings regarding the Tribunal’s several orders for interim measures dated 14 May
2010, 28 January 2011 and 9 February 2011; namely: (i) the first application by the
Claimants made by letter dated 23 February 2011; (ii) the second application by the
Respondent made by letter dated 24 February 2011; (iii) the third application by the
Respondent made by letter dated 28 February 2011; and (iv) the fourth application by the
Claimants made by letter dated 4 March 2011.

2. First Application: As regards the first application by the Claimants for further interim
measures against the Respondent in regard to the criminal proceedings in Ecuador
concerning (inter alios) two of the Claimants’ legal representatives (Messrs Ricardo Veiga
and Rodrigo Pérez), the Tribunal refers to the Claimants’ letter dated 23 February 2011, the
Claimants’ email message dated 25 February 2011 and the Respondent's letter dated 10
March 2011.

3. Having considered the Parties’ written submissions listed in paragraph 2 above (with
attached exhibits), together with all other relevant circumstances in this case, the Tribunal
does not consider it appropriate to grant the Claimants’ application pleaded specifically at
page 21 of their letter dated 23 February 2011, beyond maintaining the Tribunal’s existing
orders for interim measures.

4. Second Application: As regards the second application made by the Respondent seeking
the revocation of the Tribunal’s order dated 9 February 2011, the Tribunal refers to Part II
of the Respondent's letter dated 24 February 2011 and the Claimants’ letter dated 4 March
2011.

5. Having considered the Parties’ written submissions listed in paragraph 4 above (with
attached exhibits), together with all other relevant circumstances in this case, the Tribunal

12

does not consider it appropriate to grant the Respondent's application or the Claimants’
counter-application, beyond maintaining its existing order for interim measures dated 9
February 2011.

6. Third Application: As regards the third application made by the Respondent in regard to
alleged violations by the Claimants of the Tribunal’s orders for interim measures and for
further interim measures, the Tribunal refers to the Respondent’s letter dated 28 February
2001 and the Claimants’ letters dated 4 and 10 March 2001.

7. Having considered the Parties’ written submissions listed in paragraph 6 above (with
attached exhibits), together with all other relevant circumstances in this case, the Tribunal
does not consider it appropriate to grant the Respondent’s application pleaded specifically at
page 3 of its letter dated 28 February 2011, beyond maintaining the Tribunal’s existing
orders for interim measures.

8. Fourth Application: As regards the fourth application made by the Claimants in regard to
alleged violations by the Respondent of the Tribunal’s order dated 9 February 2011, the
Tribunal refers to the Claimants’ letter dated 4 March 2011.

9. Having considered the written submissions listed in paragraph 8 above (with attached
exhibits), together with all other relevant circumstances in this case, the Tribunal does not
consider it appropriate to grant the Claimants’ application, beyond maintaining the
Tribunal’s existing order for interim measures dated 9 February 2011.

10. This procedural order shall not prejudice any issue as regards jurisdiction, admissibility
or merits in these proceedings; nor shall it preclude any future application by any Party for
interim measures or like relief in the event of any change in relevant circumstances.”

(V) THE PARTIES’ PRESENT APPLICATIONS

WHEREAS:

(A) By letter dated 4 January 2012, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Provincial
Court of Sucumbios had issued on 3 January 2012 a decision affirming on appeal the decision
of the first-instance court of 14 February 2011 in the Ecuadorian legal proceedings entitled
Maria Aguinda et al v Chevron Texaco Corporation (also known as the “Lago Agrio Case” or
“Lago Agrio Litigation” ) whereby the Provincial Court rejected the appeals of both Chevron

specifically (with footnotes here omitted):

“(1) Declaring that Claimants have met all of the legal requirements for interim measures
protection, including a declaration that Claimants have presented a prima facie case

on the merits, including prima facie evidence that the claims involved in the Lago

Agrio Litigation have been settled and released by the Government, that the Lago

Agrio Litigation has been tainted by fraud and/or serious due process violations, and

that the Government has violated the Treaty and international law;

(2) Declaring that Respondent has breached its obligations under the Interim Measures
Order and international law to “take all measures at its disposal” to suspend or cause
to be suspended the enforcement or recognition of the Lago Agrio Judgment within
and without Ecuador:

(a) The suspension of any certificate providing that the judgment is final or
enforceable by the Secretariats of all Ecuadorian courts;

(b) The declaration of a suspension of the Judgment’s enforceability during the
pendency of any further legal recourse from the Judgment in Ecuador,

including waiver or relief from the bond requirement, whether through an Attorney
General opinion under Article 237 of the Ecuadorian Constitution or

through other effective means by a Government official;

(c) The injunction of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, the Amazon Defense Front, and
any trust established either pursuant to the Judgment or by agreement of the
Plaintiffs or their lawyers and representatives, from seeking to recognize or
enforce the Judgment anywhere in the world, by the appropriate Government
branch or organ;

(d) The declaration, through its judges or otherwise, that Chevron is not required

14

to post a bond during any further appeals or legal recourse in Ecuador in
order to suspend the Judgment’s enforceability, or the undertaking to post a
bond or alternative form of security sufficient to relieve Chevron of any bond
that might be required by Respondent’s judicial branch in order for Chevron
to pursue further appeals in Ecuador in a manner that suspends enforcement
of the Judgment;

(3) Declaring that: (i) pending the outcome of this arbitration, the Lago Agrio Judgment
is not enforceable, within and without Ecuador, because it is inconsistent with
Ecuador’s obligations under the U.S.-Ecuador BIT and international law, including
Article II(7) of the BIT imposing a positive obligation on Ecuador to provide

effective means of enforcing rights, both substantive and due-process; and (ii) this
declaration is binding not only as a matter of international law, but also as a matter of
Ecuadorian law;

(4) Declaring that Respondent has the legal obligation to appear in any proceedings for the
enforcement or recognition of the Lago Agrio Judgment within and without Ecuador, and to
declare in any such proceedings that the Judgment is not enforceable under Ecuadorian law,
and to request that any such proceedings for enforcement or recognition be discontinued or
stayed pending the outcome of this arbitration;

(5) Declaring that, on account of the breaches stated in requests (1) and (2), any and all
attorneys’ fees, costs and other expenses incurred by Claimants in defending, or preparing to
defend against, recognition and enforcement actions related to the Lago Agrio Judgment may
be damages for which Respondent would be responsible to Claimants under international
law;

(6) Reiterating its prior declaration that, if it were established that any judgment made by an
Ecuadorian court in the Lago Agrio Case was a breach of an obligation by Respondent owed
to Claimants as a matter of international law, any loss arising from the enforcement of such
judgment (within and without Ecuador) may be losses for which Respondent would be
responsible to Claimants under international law, as expressed in Part Two of the
International Law Commission’s Articles on Stat Responsibility; and

(7) Granting any other and further relief that the Tribunal deems appropriate in the
circumstances”;

(F) By letter dated 13 January 2012, the Respondent replied to the Claimants’ said letter of 12
January 2012, disputing (inter alia) the Claimants’ application and indicating that it would
make a further reply “on or before 24 January 2012”;
