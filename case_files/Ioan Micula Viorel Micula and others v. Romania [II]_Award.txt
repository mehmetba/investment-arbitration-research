INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Agreement between the
Kingdom of Sweden and Romania on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of
Investments, which entered into force on | April 2003 (the “BIT” or “Treaty”) and the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of
Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 and which became binding on
Romania on 12 October 1975 and on Sweden on 28 January 1967 (the “ICSID

Convention”).

The individual claimants are Mr. Ioan Micula and Mr. Viorel Micula, natural persons
having the nationality of Sweden (together “individual Claimants” or “Messrs. Micula”).
The corporate claimants, all companies incorporated under the laws of Romania, are S.C.
Scandic Distilleries S.A. (“Scandic”); S.C. European Food S.A. (“European Food”); S.C.
Transilvania General Import-Export S.R.L. (“TGIE”); $.C. Starmill S.R.L. (“Starmill”);
S.C. European Drinks S.A. (“European Drinks”); S.C. Multipack S.R.L. (“Multipack”);
S.C. Rieni Drinks S.A. (“Rieni’”); S.C. Tonical Trading S.R.L. (“Tonical Trading”); S.C.
Edri Trading S.R.L. (“Edri Trading”); and S.C. West Leasing International S.R.L. (“West
Leasing”) (together the “corporate Claimants”). (Collectively, the claimants are referred to

as “Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula, and Others” or the “Claimants”).
The respondent is Romania (“Romania” or the “Respondent”).

The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

This dispute relates to the Claimants’ business activities in Romania pertaining to the
production and sale of alcoholic spirits and related activities, and to actions or omissions
by Romania said to affect these activities. The Claimants contend that Romania’s conduct
breaches the BIT, including its provisions requiring Romania to ensure fair and equitable

treatment (Article 2(3)), prohibiting the impairment of investments through unreasonable

or discriminatory measures (Article 2(3)), and to provide investments full protection and

security (Article 3(1)), as well as the BIT’s umbrella clause (Article 2(4)).

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 30 October 2014, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated that same day from the
Claimants against Romania, together with Exhibits C-1 through C-28 (the “Request”).

On 24 November 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in
accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the
registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to
proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d)
of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration

Proceedings.

In the absence of an agreement between the Parties on the method of constituting the
Tribunal, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in Article

37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.

The Tribunal is composed of Professor Donald McRae, a national of Canada and New
Zealand, President, appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council in
accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention; Mr. John Beechey CBE, a national
of the United Kingdom, appointed by the Claimants, and Professor John Crook, a national
of the United States of America, appointed by the Respondent. Mr. Beechey was appointed
on 22 January 2018, after the resignation of Dr. Michael Pryles, a national of Australia,

who was the Claimants’ initial appointee.

On 24 April 2015, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules
of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), notified the Parties that
all three initially-appointed arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the
Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Martina Polasek,

ICSID Legal Counsel, were designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. During the

' The witness statements

course of the arbitration, Ms. Polasek was replaced by Ms. Celeste Mowatt, Legal Counsel;

thereafter Ms. Mowatt was replaced by Ms. Anna Holloway, Legal Counsel.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the

Parties on 8 June 2015 by teleconference.

Following the first session, on 21 July 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1
recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decision of the
Tribunal on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. | provides, inter alia, that the applicable
Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural language

would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Paris, France.

On 18 November 2015, the Claimants submitted a request for a ten-day extension to file
their Memorial on the Merits, and on 19 November 2015, the Respondent requested leave
to respond to the request, which was granted by the Tribunal on the same day. By letter of
23 November 2015, the Respondent opposed the Claimants’ request, and asked that the
Tribunal either suspend the existing procedural timetable or grant the Claimants a three-
day extension to file their Memorial and the Respondents a three-day extension to file its

Counter-Memorial or its Rejoinder.

On 27 November 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the
procedural calendar, granting the Claimants a six-day extension to file its Memorial, and
the Respondent a six-day extension to file its Counter-Memorial, and setting a revised

procedural calendar.

On 14 December 2015, in accordance with the revised procedural calendar, the Claimants
filed a Memorial on the Merits, together with Exhibits C-1 through C-247, Legal
Authorities CL-1 through CL-83, as well as four witness statements and five expert

reports. '

  

vere:

(1) CW-1, the Witness Statement of Mr. Ioan Micula, dated 12 December 2015, together with Exhibits CW-1-A to
CW-1-C;

16. On 23 December 2015, the Claimants filed an Application for Provisional Measures (the
“December 2015 Application”), together with Exhibits C-248 through C-260 and Legal
Authorities CL-84 through CL-95. The earlier ICSID Award in Joan Micula, Viorel Micula
and others v Romania (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20) (“Micula I Award”), issued on 11
December 2013, had awarded damages to the claimants in that proceeding (some of whom.
are also the Claimants in this proceeding). On 30 March 2015, the European Commission
(“EC”) had ruled that payment by Romania of the sums due under that Award would
constitute illegal state aid and required Romania to recover any amounts already paid to
the Micula J claimants (“Final Decision on State Aid” or “EC Decision”). The Claimants’
December 2015 Application arose in light of measures taken by Romania in connection

with that EC Decision.
17. In the Application, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal issue:

(i) an Order restoring the status quo existing prior to the
Measures by instructing Romania to revoke, or suspend all
effects of, Decision 106/22.10.2015, unseal Scandic’s
production equipment, allow Scandic to resume control of
its own ethyl alcohol stock, and abstain from implementing
any new or similar measures against any of the Micula
Companies (European Food, Starmill, Multipack, European
Drinks, Rieni Drinks, Scandic Distilleries, Edri Trading,
West Leasing, Tonical Trading and Transilvania General
Import Export) or their affiliates, prior to the Tribunal’s
issuance of its final award (and that the final award itself
deal[] with the matter as appropriate at that time, such as

(2) CW-2, the Witness Statement of Mr. Viorel Micula, dated 12 December 2015;

(3) CW-3, the Witness Statement of Mr. Mircea Halbac, dated 14 December 2015, together with Exhibits CW-3-A to
CW-3-F;

(4) CW-4, the Witness Statement of Mr. Juan Gamecho, dated 12 December 2015;

The expert reports were:

(1) CER-1, the Expert Report of Brattle Group, dated 14 December 2015, together with Exhibits CER-1-001 to CER-
1-075 and CER-1-077 to CER-1-254;

(2) CER-2, the Expert Report of Compania de Anchete, with Exhibits CER-2-001- to CER-2-009;

(3) CER-3, the Expert Report of PwC, dated 8 December 2015, with Exhibits CER-3-001 to CER-3-014;

(4) CER-4, the Expert Report of CURS, dated 2 December 2015;

(5) CER-5, the Expert Report of BDO, dated 9 December 2015.

2 The claimants in the Micula I proceeding were Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula, 8.C. European Food S.A. (“European
Food”), S.C. Multipack S.R.L. (“Multipack”), and $.C. Starmill $.RL. (“Starmill”), who are also Claimants in this
proceeding.

by maintaining the Order in place until Romania has
satisfied the terms of the final award in full); and

(ii) an Order preserving the status quo by instructing Romania
to suspend all effects of its decisions to annul the
rescheduling agreements with TGIE, Rieni Drinks and
European Drinks, respectively, to withdraw or otherwise
cease and desist from pursuing the forced execution against
the assets of TGIE, Rieni Drinks and European Drinks, and
abstain from implementing any new or similar orders
against any of the Micula Companies (European Food,
Starmill, Multipack, European Drinks, Rieni Drinks,
Scandic Distilleries, Edri Trading, West Leasing, Tonical
Trading and Transilvania General Import Export) or their
affiliates, prior to the Tribunal’s issuance of its final award
(and that the final award itself deals with the matter as
appropriate at that time, such as by maintaining the Order
in place until Romania has satisfied the terms of the final
award in full); and

[...] an emergency, temporary order: (i) instructing
Romania to suspend all effects of Decision 106/22.10.2015,
immediately unseal Scandic’s production equipment and
allow Scandic to resume control of its own ethyl alcohol
stock; and (ii) prohibiting Romania from pursuing the
immediate and forced execution against TGIE’s, Rieni
Drinks’ and European Drinks’ assets, or the assets of any of
the Micula Companies [...] or their affiliates, and from
otherwise aggravating or extending the existing dispute,
until the Tribunal issues its decision on this application.

18. On 30 December 2015, both Parties filed their views on the briefing schedule in respect of
the Application, and the Respondent filed comments on the Claimants’ request for an

emergency temporary order, together with Exhibits R-001 and R-002 and Legal Authorities
RL-001 through RL-005.

19. On 1 January 2016, the Tribunal declined to issue the emergency order sought by the
Claimants and advised the Parties of the briefing schedule with regard to the December
2015 Application. The Tribunal further stated that “during the pendency of the

consideration of the [December 2015 Application], the parties shall refrain from any action

that may prejudice the position of the other party in these proceedings or otherwise

aggravate the dispute.”

On 13 January 2016, the Respondent filed observations on the Claimants’ request for
provisional measures contained in the December 2015 Application, accompanied by

Exhibits R-003 through R-030 and Legal Authorities RL-006 through RL-013.

On 25 January 2016, the Claimant filed a reply on provisional measures, together with
CER-5, the second expert report of BDO Business Advisory, dated 22 January 2016 (the
“Second BDO Expert Report”), Exhibits C-261 through C-300, and Legal Authorities CL-
96 through CL-104.

By letter of 26 January 2016, the Respondent sought an extension for the filing of its
rejoinder on provisional measures and requested that the Tribunal disregard the Second
BDO Expert Report. On 27 January 2016, following the Tribunals invitation, the Claimants

provided comments on the Respondent’s requests of 26 January 2016.

On 28 January 2016, the Tribunal granted the Respondent an additional seven days for the
filing of its rejoinder, including its comments on the admissibility of the Second BDO

Expert Report.

On 8 February 2016, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Claimants’ December 2015
Application for provisional measures, together with an expert report of Dr. Robin Cohen,
dated 8 February 2016, Exhibits R-031 through R-040, and Legal Authorities RL-014
through RL-016.

On | March 2016, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Provisional Measures (addressing
the Claimants’ December 2015 Application). The Tribunal directed the Parties to “refrain
from any action that may prejudice the position of the other party in these proceedings or
otherwise aggravate the dispute” and directed the Respondent to “notify the Tribunal in
advance of taking any measures against the Claimants that could significantly impair the
financial position of the Corporate Claimants during the course of these proceedings.” The
Claimants’ other requests for provisional measures were denied, and the Tribunal reserved

the issue of costs.

By letter of 15 April 2016, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order the Claimants
to immediately provide documentation connected with CER-4, the “CURS Report,” dated
2 December 2015. Later that same day, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to file their
comments on the Respondent’s request by 20 April 2016. In accordance with the Tribunal’s
instructions, on 20 April 2016, the Claimants provided their comments on the Respondent’s
letter, and requested that the Tribunal dismiss the requests contained therein in their

entirety.

On 25 April 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, denying the Respondent’s
request of 15 April 2016, but noting that the relevant documentation could be requested in

accordance with the procedure set out in Procedural Order No. 1.

On 23 May 2016, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits,
together with the Witness Statement of Mr. Claudiu Codrea, dated 20 May 2016, the Expert
Report of Dr. Robin Cohen, dated 23 May 2016, with Exhibits RC-1-001 to RC-1-137,
Exhibits R-041 through R-268, and Legal Authorities RL-017 through RL-075.

On 15 July 2016, the Parties submitted their requests for the production of documents to
the Tribunal. On 15 August 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, ordering the
Parties to produce documents by 29 August 2017, together with any privilege logs.

On 26 September 2017, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had entered into a
confidentiality agreement regarding the production of certain documents responsive to the
Claimants’ document production requests. On the same date, the Parties transmitted the

confidentiality agreement to the Tribunal.

On 27 September 2017, the Claimants requested that the President of the Tribunal organize

a conference call with the Parties to review the state of production of documents.

The Tribunal provided clarifications regarding its document production order during the

course of the call.

On 10 November 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that domestic stay orders

preventing the Romanian National Agency for Fiscal Administration (“ANAF”) from

pursuing enforcement proceedings in Romania against particular Claimants (proceedings

arising from the EC Decision pertaining to the Micula J Award) had been lifted, and

therefore the ANAF “intend[ed] to take enforcement actions against [those] Claimants to

35.

36.

37.

recover a total amount of RON 383,174,578.82 plus interest that the European Commission
ruled to constitute illegal State aid under European law in its Decision of 30 March 2015.”
The Respondent explained that it did “not consider that the contemplated actions
necessarily constitute measures that ‘could significantly impair the financial position of the
Corporate Claimants’, such that they must be notified in advance to the Tribunal in
accordance with its Decision on Provisional Measures of 1 March 2016. Nonetheless, out
of an abundance of caution, the Respondent wishes to inform the Tribunal in advance of

its planned enforcement measures.”

On the same date, the Claimants asked that the Tribunal allow them to comment on the
Respondent’s letter. The Claimants also requested the Tribunal to (i) order Romania to
provide evidence supporting its allegation that the stay orders have been lifted and any
other documents on which it relied, and (ii) direct Romania not to take any of the measures

indicated until further order of the Tribunal (“Claimants’ 10 November 2016 Requests”).

On 12 November 2016, the Tribunal confirmed that it would allow the Claimants to
respond to the Respondent’s letter, but deferred the Claimants’ 10 November 2017

Requests until after it received an elaboration of the Claimants’ position.

On 17 November 2016, the Claimants filed their response to the Respondent’s 10
November 2016 letter, accompanied by Exhibits C-331 to C-335. In their letter, the
Claimants argued, inter alia, that, contrary to the Respondent’s assertions, the domestic
proceedings in question were “still pending and the stays of enforcement are therefore still
in force, and will continue to be in force, until the final resolution of these proceedings.”
The Claimants requested that the Tribunal order the preservation of the status quo by
instructing Romania to cease and desist from pursuing the planned enforcement actions
and to refrain from pursuing similar measures prior to the issuance of the Tribunal’s final
award. The Claimants also requested that the Tribunal order that all Parties refrain from
any action that may prejudice the position of the other party in these proceedings or
otherwise aggravate the dispute, pending the resolution of the Application (together,

“Claimants’ 17 November 2016 Requests”).

On 21 November 2016, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to respond to the Claimants’
17 November 2016 letter and to clarify the statement in the Respondent’s letter of 10
November 2016 that the “legal challenges brought by the companies [...] have since been

rejected by the courts and the suspensions lifted.”

On 28 November 2016, the Respondent filed its observations on the Claimants’ 17
November 2016 letter, accompanied by Exhibits R-269 to R-284 and Legal Authorities
RL-76 to RL-79.

On 6 December 2016, the Claimants sought an extension of time of at least eight additional
weeks to submit their Reply. The Claimants noted that an extension would necessarily
require a change to the hearing dates and suggested that the Tribunal could first provide
the Parties with its next availabilities for the hearing, after which the Parties could “confer
and propose a new procedural timetable for the submission of Claimants’ Reply and

Romania’s Rejoinder.”

By a second letter of the same date, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal issue a
confidentiality order in anticipation of certain “Attorneys-Eyes Only” documentation they
intended to submit as evidence. The Claimants’ letter summarized the areas of agreement
already reached in inter partes correspondence, presented the Claimants’ position on one

disputed matter, and proposed text for the body of a confidentiality order by the Tribunal.

On 7 December 2016, the Claimants filed a reply to the Respondent’s observations on the
Claimants’ 17 November 2016 Requests, accompanied by CER-6, the third expert report
of BDO Business Advisory dated 7 December 2016 (“Third BDO Expert Report”),
Exhibits C-336 to C-338 and Legal Authorities CL-107 and CL-108.

On 9 Di ber 2016, the R d bmitted a letter ri ding to the Claimants’ first

 

letter of 6 December 2016, regarding the Claimants’ request for an extension.

On 12 December 2016, the Respondent submitted a letter responding to the Claimants’

second letter of 6 December 2016 concerning confidentiality.

2016 Requests, accompanied by the second Expert Report of Dr. Robin Cohen, dated 14
December 2016.

By letter of the same date, the Claimants set forth further comments regarding their

requested extension.

On 21 December 2016, the Tribunal granted a one-month extension of the deadline for the
Claimants’ Reply and a corresponding extension for the filing of the Respondent’s
Rejoinder. Noting that the extension would require the postponement of the proposed
hearing dates, the Tribunal invited the Parties to indicate their availability for a hearing

from 21 to 26 August 2017.

Also, on 21 December 2016, the Claimants provided their comments on Romania’s letter
of 12 December 2016 concerning the submission of documents and information designated
as confidential under the Confidentiality Agreement. The Respondent responded to the

Claimants’ letter on 22 December 2016.

On 21 December 2016, the Respondent submitted to the Tribunal a letter that Romania
received from the European Commission on 16 December 2016, after it had filed its 14
December 2016 submission on the Claimants’ New Application. The letter was submitted

as Exhibit R-288.

On 22 December 2016, the Claimants objected to the Respondent’s submission of the 16
December 2016 letter from the EC as Exhibit R-288, arguing that paragraph 16.3 of
Procedural Order No. | provided that exhibits were to be filed with written submissions
authorized by the Tribunal except in exceptional circumstances and with advance leave
granted by the Tribunal. In the alternative, the Claimants requested an opportunity to
respond to the document and requested the Tribunal to direct Romania to produce the
“previous correspondence” referred to in Exhibit R-288 as well as any other
correspondence exchanged between Romania and the EC concerning these matters during

the February-December 2016 timeframe.

Following the Tribunal’s invitation, the Respondent replied to the Claimants’ 22 December
2016 communication concerning Exhibit R-288 on 30 December 2016. The Respondent
objected to the Claimants’ request that Exhibit R-288 not be admitted, but it indicated that
it would be willing to provide the previous correspondence referred to in Exhibit R-288, if

it would be helpful to resolve the Claimants’ application.

On 30 December 2016, the Parties responded to ICSID’s letter of 21 December 2016
concerning the procedural calendar. They indicated that it might be possible to complete
the hearing within 6 days, but requested that the Tribunal reserve an additional one or two

days.

On 6 January 2017, the Tribunal decided to admit Exhibit R-288 into the record and invited
the Respondent to produce the “previous correspondence” referenced in that document by
13 January 2017. Each Party was to be granted an opportunity to comment on such
documents. By the same letter, the Tribunal responded to the Parties’ correspondence of
30 December 2016 concerning the procedural calendar. The Tribunal indicated that if the
Parties were not available during the proposed August 2017 dates, it would likely not be
possible to schedule a hearing until April or May of 2018. The Parties were invited to
indicate whether a hearing in August 2017 would be a possibility

Also, on 6 January 2017, the Respondent submitted a letter requesting the Tribunal’s
assistance in resolving a matter concerning the production of documents relating to
criminal proceedings (“Respondent’s 6 January 2017 Application”). The letter was
accompanied by Exhibits R-289 to R-295. The documents at issue were criminal
complaints responsive to the Claimants’ document production Request No. 9, which had
already been produced by the Respondent in accordance with Procedural Order No. 4 and
the Confidentiality Agreement signed by the Parties’ representatives on 19 and 20
September 2016. The Respondent asserted privilege with respect to all criminal complaints
relating to ongoing criminal investigations, and requested the Tribunal to order the
Claimants to destroy any copies it may hold of listed criminal complaints. On 9 January
2017, the Claimants requested that they be granted until 3 February 2017 to respond to the

Respondent’s application (i.e., one business day after the deadline for the Claimants’

Reply). On 11 January 2017, the Respondent commented on the Claimants’ requested
extension. The Tribunal subsequently declined the Claimants’ request to extend the time
for their response to the Respondent’s 6 January 2017 Application until after the filing of

the Reply. The Claimants were instead invited to submit their response by 18 January 2017.

On 11 January 2017, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 5 concerning
confidentiality. Pursuant to this order, the Parties were permitted to submit certain
documents as evidence in redacted form to remove certain personal information, provided
that non-redacted versions of those documents were transmitted to opposing counsel on an

“Attorneys Eyes Only” basis.

Also, on 11 January 2017, the Parties each responded to the Tribunal’s letter of 6 January
2017 concerning the scheduling of the hearing. While the Respondent confirmed its
availability, the Claimants stated that they were not available during the proposed August
2017 dates.

On 13 January 2017, the Respondent submitted electronically the “previous
correspondence” referenced in Exhibit R-288 as Exhibits R-296 to R-304.

On 18 January 2017, the Claimants responded to the Respondent’s 6 January 2017
Application. The Claimants confirmed that they had deleted two documents in their
possession, but otherwise objected to the request that they be required to destroy documents

produced by the Respondent on the basis of privilege, arguing that no privilege applied.

On 19 January 2017, the Claimants requested a further three-week extension of the
deadline within which to file their Reply (which was, at that time, set for 30 January 2017).

On 20 January 2017, the Claimants sought leave to submit an additional document related
to their request concerning enforcement measures. The document in question was a
judgment rendered that day by the English Commercial Court, Queen’s Bench Division,
High Court of Justice. It addressed Romania’s application to set aside or stay the

registration in the United Kingdom of the Award rendered in the Micula J arbitration.

On 20 January 2017, the Respondent commented on the Claimants’ letter of 18 January

2017 regarding Respondent’s 6 January 2017 Application.

Further to the Tribunal’s invitation, on 24 January 2017, the Respondent responded to the
Claimants’ request of 19 January 2017 for an extension of the deadline for the filing of the

Reply. The Respondent objected to any further extension.

On 26 January 2017, the Tribunal granted an additional two-week extension of the deadline
for the Claimants’ Reply and a corresponding extension of the deadline for the

Respondent’s Rejoinder.

On 27 January 2017, the Respondent also responded to the Claimants’ request of 19
January 2017 to submit into the record the 20 January 2017 judgment of the English
Commercial Court relating to the enforcement of the Micula J Award. The Respondent did
not object to the document being entered into the record. In its letter the Respondent also
requested an amendment to paragraph 16.3 of Procedural Order No 1 concerning the

submission of documents.

In view of the Parties’ agreement and following the Tribunal’s invitation, on 3 February
2017 the Claimants submitted the 20 January 2017 English High Court judgment as Exhibit
C-339.

Also, on 3 February 2017, the Claimants, by separate letter, commented on the
Respondent’s request of 27 January 2017 to amend paragraph 16.3 of PO1, objecting to
the Respondent’s request. In their letter, the Claimants also requested the opportunity to
comment by 17 February 2017 on the 20 January 2017 judgment which was filed as Exhibit
C-339. The Tribunal approved that request on 6 February 2017.

On 8 February 2017, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 6 concerning the
Respondent’s 6 January 2017 Application regarding privileged documents previously
produced to the Claimants. The Tribunal instructed the Claimants to destroy or return the
Criminal Complaints listed in Annexes A and B to the Application to the Respondent. The

order further provided that once the Respondent established that proceedings related to any

Criminal Complaints have concluded, the Respondent was to make those documents

available to the Claimants.

On 13 February 2017, at the Tribunal’s invitation, the Respondent submitted further

comments concerning its proposed amendment to paragraph 16.3 of POL.

Also, on 13 February 2017, the Claimants filed their Reply on the Merits, together with
Factual Exhibits C-340 to C-460, Legal Authorities CL-109 to CL-163, as well as two

witness statements and six expert reports.*

On 15 February 2017, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they had complied with

the instructions in Procedural Order No. 6 concerning the Criminal Complaints.

On 15 February 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 declining the
Respondent’s 27 January 2017 request to amend paragraph 16.3 of PO1. However, the
Tribunal advised the Parties of “its expectation that any request for leave to submit new
documents submitted further to paragraph 16.3 of Procedural Order No. | will focus on the
justification for the introduction of the new evidence and refrain from entering into the

substance of the matter.”

On 17 February 2017, the Claimants submitted their comments on Exhibit C-339, the
English High Court judgment of 20 January 2017.

On 22 February 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to indicate by Tuesday, | March
2017, whether they would be available for a hearing during the weeks of 23 April and 30

April 2018. By communications of 24 February 2017 and 28 February 2017, the Parties

confirmed their availability for a hearing during the proposed dates.

On 6 March 2017, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Enforcement Proceedings addressing
the Claimants’ 17 November 2016 Requests related to enforcement proceedings against

the Claimants in Romania. The Decision recorded the following orders:

1. The Tribunal reaffirms its decision of March 1, 2016, in
particular:

That the parties shall refrain from any action that may
prejudice the position of the other party in these proceedings
or otherwise aggravate the dispute; and

That the Respondent shall notify the Tribunal in advance of
taking any measures against the Claimants that could
significantly impair the financial position of the Corporate
Claimants during the course of these proceedings.

N

The Respondent shall provide the Tribunal with an update
on the enforcement actions outlined in its letter of November
10, 2016.

3. The Claimants’ other requests are denied.
4. Costs shall be reserved until later in these proceedings.

On 29 March 2017, in accordance with the Decision on Enforcement Proceedings, the
Respondent provided an update on the enforcement actions outlined in its notification to

the Tribunal of 10 November 2016.

On 5 April 2017, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 8 concerning the procedural
calendar. The Order recorded the extensions granted by the Tribunal on 26 January 2017,
confirmed that the hearing would be held during the weeks of 23 April and 30 April 2018,
and notified the Parties of other changes to the procedural calendar consequent upon the

postponed hearing dates.

On 6 April 2017, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal seeking leave to respond to the
Respondent’s update of 29 March 2017 concerning enforcement measures. The Tribunal

invited the Claimants to submit their comments by 13 April 2017.

On 12 April 2017, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal concerning documents responsive
to their document Request No. 9, produced by the Respondent on 6 April 2017. Given the
late production of the documents, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal order that
neither Party be permitted to rely on the additional documents produced by the Respondent.
The Respondent was invited by the Tribunal to respond to the Claimants’ request by 19
April 2017.

On 13 April 2017, the Claimants submitted their comments on the Respondent’s 29 March
2017 update, accompanied by Exhibits C-461 though C-463. The Claimants requested the
Tribunal to amend its Decision on Enforcement Proceedings “so as to require that any
notice under Section IV, item 2 of the Decision must (i) specify the enforcement measures
to be taken, the specific assets involved and the date and place for the execution of the

measure and, (ii) be given at least thirty (30) days in advance.”

On 19 April 2017, the Respondent replied to the Claimants’ 12 April 2017 letter requesting
that neither Party be permitted to rely on the additional documents produced by the
Respondent on 6 April 2017. The Respondent stated that “[i]f granted, the Claimants’
request would have the drastic effect of preventing the Respondent from submitting with
its Rejoinder documents the relevance and materiality of which are undisputed by the
Parties. Having failed to even request the opportunity to file a supplementary submission
on the Additional Documents which would be entirely feasible given that the current
procedural timetable provides for a hearing only in April 2018, the Claimants cannot be

heard to argue that the Additional Documents should be excluded from this arbitration.”

On 20 April 2017, the Respondent objected to the Claimants’ letter of 13 April 2017

requesting an amendment to the Decision on Enforcement Proceedings.

On 25 April 2017, the Claimants responded to the Respondent’s letter of 19 April 2017
regarding the documents produced by the Respondent on 6 April 2017.

17

83. By letter of 28 April 2017, the Tribunal decided on the Claimants’ application of 13 April
2017 seeking the modification of the Decision on Enforcement Proceedings. The Tribunal

considered that no action was required at that time. It stated that:

Having considered these matters, the Tribunal is of the view that it
need take no further action. It reminds the Parties that, as set out in
its Decision of 1 March 2016, the primary concern of the Tribunal
in considering the issue of enforcement measures is “for the
procedural integrity of the proceedings and the avoidance of any
aggravation or exacerbation of the dispute during the course of the
proceedings”.

The Tribunal also reminds the Parties of the obligation set out in
Section IV, paragraph 1 of that Decision, not to “prejudice the
position of the other party in these proceedings or otherwise
aggravate the dispute.”

The Tribunal requests the Respondent to provide a further update
on enforcement measures six months from the date of this letter. The
Tribunal expects that such an update will provide sufficient
specificity of the enforcement measures and the assets to which they
relate to allow the Tribunal to evaluate the effect, if any, of the
measures on this proceeding.

The Tribunal also reminds the Respondent that, independently of the
update on enforcement measures, it has an obligation under
paragraph 2 of the Decision of I March 2016 to “notify the Tribunal
in advance of taking any measures against the Claimants that could
significantly impair the financial position of the Corporate
Claimants during the course of these proceedings”.

84. On | May 2017, with the Tribunal’s leave, the Respondent submitted a response to the
Claimants’ letter of 25 April 2017.

85. On 2 May 2017, the Respondent submitted a further letter concerning enforcement
measures, notifying the Tribunal that “the Excise Commission may decide to revoke
European Food’s fiscal warehouse authorisation. ANAF would also be required to take
steps to recover European Food’s reinstated tax debts, however Romania will notify the

Tribunal separately in advance of any such actions.”

On 11 May 2017, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 9, which addressed the
Claimants’ request of 12 April 2017, concerning the documents produced by the
Respondent in April 2017. The Tribunal decided that it would be “premature to rule that
documents produced in April 2017 be disregarded without knowing what specific
documents are being referred to and what reliance is being placed on them.” The Tribunal
therefore instructed the Parties that, “[i]f either Party wishes to rely on documents included
in the April Document Production, it shall seek authorization from the Tribunal to do so
by 15 June 2017, indicating the purpose for which the documents would be introduced and
how they would constitute ‘rebuttal documentary evidence’ for purposes of paragraph 16.1

of Procedural Order No. 1.”

On 24 May 2017 the Respondent provided a further update concerning enforcement

measures.

On 15 June 2017, further to Procedural Order No. 9, the Respondent sought authorization

from the Tribunal to rely on certain challenged documents in its Rejoinder.

Following an invitation by the Tribunal, on 29 June 2017 the Claimants responded to the
Respondent’s 15 June 2017 letter. The Claimants maintained their objection to the
submission of these documents into the record by the Respondent. The Claimants requested
that, if the Tribunal were to grant the Respondent’s application, the Claimants be given
“leave to submit a supplemental report by FinExpert addressing Romania’s use of such

materials in its Rejoinder.”

By email the same day, the Respondent confirmed that it would not object “if the Tribunal
wished to grant the Claimants a reasonable deadline for submitting a second expert report

from FinExpert after the Rejoinder, should they feel the need to do so.”

On 7 July 2017, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 10 which granted the
Respondent’s request to submit the documents and information identified in its 15 June
2017 letter. The Tribunal also granted the Claimants the opportunity to submit a
supplemental FinExpert Report “addressing the way in which the Respondent has used
these documents in its Rejoinder” by 15 September 2017.

19

92. On 27 July 2017, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder, together with four witness statements,
three expert reports, Exhibits R-305 through R-443 (including the documents which the
Respondent was permitted to submit further to Procedural Order No. 10), and Legal
Exhibits RL-080 through RL-113.°

93. On 7 September 2017, the Claimants requested an extension until 17 November 2017 to

submit FinExpert’s supplemental report.

94. On 11 September 2017, the Respondent objected to the request, arguing that the Claimants
“are in effect not requesting an extension of time to file an expert report that complies with
PO 10, but to significantly expand upon the scope from what the Tribunal gave them

permission to submit.” (emphasis omitted)
95. On 15 September 2017, the Claimants responded to the Respondent’s objection.

96. On 22 September 2017, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 11 concerning the
Claimants’ requested extension of the deadline for the Supplemental FinExpert report and
the Parties’ subsequent correspondence, granting the Claimants until 30 October 2017 to
file the report, and the Respondent until 30 November 2017 to submit any observations

thereon.

97. On 19 October 2017, the Parties submitted a joint proposal to modify the procedural
calendar, suggesting revised dates for the pre-hearing deadlines. The Tribunal, on 25

October 2017, approved the revised deadlines and proposed that the pre-hearing

* The witnes:

organizational meeting be held by the President with the Parties by telephone conference

on | February 2018. The Parties subsequently confirmed their availability.

On 30 October 2017, the Respondent provided a six-month update concerning enforcement
measures in accordance with the Tribunal’s directions in its letter of 28 April 2017. The
update detailed enforcement measures which were to be undertaken against several of the

corporate Claimants in furtherance of the EC’s Decision on State Aid.

On 31 October 2017, the Claimants submitted the supplemental expert report of Ms.
Ramona Milea of FinExpert Consulting dated 31 October 2017.

On 6 November 2017, the Respondent objected to the FinExpert’s supplemental expert
report, arguing that it did not comply with the Tribunal’s directions because the report was
not “limited to ‘addressing the way in which the Respondent has used [the new] documents
in its Rejoinder’” as required by paragraph 7 of the Procedural Order No. 11. The
Respondent requested that the Tribunal not admit the report, fix a short period of no more
than one week for the Claimants to file a revised report that complied with the Tribunal’s
directions, and invite the Respondent to respond within one month from the date of its

filing.

On 7 November 2017, the Claimants submitted a corrected version of the supplemental
expert report of Ms. Milea dated 31 October 2017, stating that in reviewing the report, Ms.
Milea had “noticed that corrections to certain calculations had not been incorporated
resulting in some small differences in certain of the figures presented” as well as certain
typographical errors. The Claimants provided a version of the Supplemental FinExpert

Report showing the modifications in track changes.

On 14 November 2017, at the Tribunal’s invitation, the Claimants responded to the
Respondent’s application of 6 November 2017, disputing the Respondent’s interpretation
of Procedural Order No. 11. The Claimants argued that an analysis of the full set of
documents produced by the Respondent was not contrary to the Tribunal’s direction, and
noted that the Rejoinder “used the late-produced documents to criticize the conclusions

that FinExpert had reached based on a sample of the full set of documents.” The Claimants

21

therefore asked the Tribunal to reject the Respondent’s request to disregard the

Supplemental FinExpert Report.

103. On 15 November 2017, the Claimants responded to the Respondent’s update of 30 October

2017 concerning enforcement measures. The Claimants requested that the Tribunal:

(i) affirm that Romania’s Second Update does not provide
“sufficient specificity of the enforcement measures and the assets to
which they relate to allow the Tribunal to evaluate the effect, if any,
of the measures on this proceeding” which would satisfy the
requirements set forth in the Tribunal’s letter of 28 April 2017
(including, but not limited to, any measures against Multipack
and/or European Food as a result of Romania’s planned
cancellation of Multipack’s debt restructuring agreement); and

(ii) order Ri ia_to refrain from (a) cancelling Multipack’s
re lis agreement _and__(b) _initiati any enforcement
measures agai y of the Claimants before the e: of thirty
(30) days following a noti) ion fulfilling the requirements of the

Tribunal’s letter of 28 April 2017.

   

Claimants note that the current situation is very different from that
before the Tribunal at the time of its Decision on Provisional
Measures of I March 2016, in that (i) Claimants have not, and
cannot, initiate court proceedings concerning the cancellation of
Multipack’s agreement (because a decision is yet to be taken) and
(ii) Romania states that it will take action upon cancellation (cf.
paras 58-60 of the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures, 1
March 2016). Since it can take months following a decision to
cancel the rescheduling agreement to obtain a stay order in court
(against the immediate enforcement of the cancellation decision)
Romania can — absent the requested order from the Tribunal —
proceed with enforcement measures immediately upon cancellation.
Therefore, the requested order (see item (ii) above) is necessary,
and urgent, to avoid that Romania takes measures that will
significantly impair the financial position of the Corporate
Claimants during the course of these proceedings and prejudice
Claimants’ position in these proceedings.

104. On 16 November 2017, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to submit its comments to the
Claimants’ letters of 14 and 15 November 2017 by 23 November 2017. The following day,

the Respondent requested an extension of the deadline for its response to the Claimants’

22

105.

106.

107.

108.

15 November 2017 letter, on the basis that the letter contained a new request for provisional
measures. The Tribunal granted the Respondent’s request for an extension until 4

December 2017.

On 21 November 2017, the Respondent submitted its comments to the Claimants’ 14
November 2017 letter and maintained its request to have the Supplemental FinExpert
Report disregarded as contrary to the Tribunal’s previous orders and prejudicing the
Respondent’s rights of due process. Alternatively, the Respondent requested that, should
the Tribunal decide to admit the Supplemental Expert Report, the Respondent be granted

until 26 January 2018 to provide its comments.

On 22 November 2017, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal to notify it “of a violation by
Romania of the Decision on Provisional Measures that intervened after Claimants’ last
communication concerning Romania’s Second Update on Enforcement.” The Claimants

requested urgent relief concerning this violation. In particular, the Claimants requested:

That the Tribunal immediately order Romania to refrain from taking
any enforcement measures against European Food for the recovery
of RON 26,462,788.70 in additional interest on the recovery of
allegedly paid State aid in accordance with the EC Final Decision.
Given the urgent nature of this request, Claimants respectfilly
request that the Tribunal issue such a decision before 4 December
2017, i.e. the day prior to the expiry of the 15-day notice period and
the commencement of Romania's enforcement measures against
European Food. If such an order is not rendered, then Claimants
request that the Tribunal instruct Romania not to take any action
before the Tribunal has rendered its decision on these matters.

Following the Tribunal’s invitation, the Respondent responded to the Claimants’ urgent
request of 22 November 2017 on 28 November 2017. The Respondent asserted that “the
Claimants’ request relies on misrepresentations of the facts and Romanian law and is
pleaded before the wrong forum. Romania respectfully requests the Tribunal to dismiss the

Claimants’ request for urgent relief of 22 November 2017.”

Also, on 28 November 2017, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 12 concerning
the Respondent’s request of 6 November 2017 relating to the Supplemental FinExpert

Report. The Tribunal rejected the Respondent’s request to disregard the supplemental

23

109.

110.

FinExpert Report and set a deadline of 5 January 2018 for the Respondent to file its
comments on that Report. The Order also recorded the amendments to the procedural

calendar further to the Parties’ joint proposal of 19 October 2017.

Following the Tribunal’s invitation, on 30 November 2017, the Claimants submitted
comments on the Respondent’s letter of 28 November 2017. The Claimants disputed the
Respondent’s characterization of the request as being outside the scope of this proceeding.
The Claimants maintained the request in their 22 November 2017 letter, but in the
alternative, requested that the Tribunal instruct Romania not to take any action before the
Tribunal had (i) been provided with a notification sufficient to “evaluate the effect, if any,

of the measures in this proceeding” and (ii) rendered its decision on these matters.

By letter of 1 December 2017 sent by ICSID, the Tribunal decided on the Claimants’
application of 22 November 2017, as follows:

The Tribunal has reviewed the letters of the Claimants of 22
November 2017 and 30 November 2017 and the letter of the
Respondent of 28 November 2017 regarding certain enforcement
measures that the Claimants say Romania is planning to take after
5 December 2017, including seizure of bank accounts and the sale
of assets of one of the Claimants, European Foods.

The Tribunal understands the position of Romania to be that the
interest that was the subject of the ANAF summons of 20 November
2017 was interest on existing amounts for which the enforcement
measures have been identified in their notifications to the Tribunal
of 11 November 2016 and 30 October 2017 and there are no
separate plans for the enforcement of the interest amount in the
summons of 20 November 2017 from those described in these
previous notifications.

Accordingly, the Tribunal requests the Respondent to confirm by
c.o.b, Monday 4 December 2017 that enforcement of the amounts
indicated in the ANAF summons of 20 November are to take place
in accordance with the enforcement plans described in the
Respondent's notifications of 11 November 2016 and 30 October
2017 and that there will be no separate enforcement, including
seizure of ba[n]k accounts and sale of assets of European Foods,
following 5 December 2017.

If the Tribunal receives the assurances requested, it sees no need at

the present time to make the orders requested by the Claimants.
By a second letter of 1 December 2017, ICSID notified the Parties that Dr. Pryles was
resigning as an arbitrator in this proceeding; Dr. Pryles’ resignation was submitted in view

of his unavailability during the scheduled hearing dates in April and May 2018.

On 2 December 2017, the Claimants requested that Dr. Pryles “reconsider and withdraw
his resignation as a Member of the Tribunal” and further requested that the other Members
of the Tribunal “refrain from deciding whether to accept Dr. Pryles’ resignation until he

has had an opportunity to respond to this request.”

On 3 December 2017, the Respondent responded to the Claimants’ letter for 2 December
2017. It stated that it had no comments on the letter, but that it would strongly object to

any postponement of the hearing.

On 4 December 2017, the Claimants notified the Tribunal of further actions being taken by

the Respondent against the Scandic Distilleries. The Claimants’ letter stated:

Since no mention of this new attempt by Romania to put Claimants
out of business has been made in either of Romania’s previous
updates to the Tribunal, Claimants expect that Romania will comply
with the orders of this Tribunal and refrain from taking any
prejudicial action against Claimants — specifically issuing a
decision on the enforcement of excises on vinegar against Scandic
Distilleries — until it has properly notified this Tribunal.

On 4 December 2017, the Respondent responded to the Claimants’ application of 15
November 2017.

On 6 December 2017, ICSID wrote to the Parties at the request of the President of the
Tribunal concerning Dr. Pryles’ resignation. The Parties were invited to indicate whether
they would agree to a postponement of the hearing to September 2018 and for Dr. Pryles’

resignation to be withdrawn.

118.

119.

120.

121.

On 7 December 2017, in accordance with the Decision on Provisional Measures of 1 March
2016, the Respondent notified the Tribunal of further enforcement measures which it

intended to take.

On 13 December 2017, the Parties responded to ICSID’s letter of 7 December 2017
concerning Dr. Pryles’ resignation. The Claimants indicated that they would not be
available for a hearing during September 2018 and the Respondent indicated that it would

not agree to the postponement of the hearing.

Following the invitation of the President of the Tribunal, the Claimants responded to the
Respondent’s 7 December 2017 letter on 14 December 2017. The Claimants’ letter was
accompanied by the fifth expert report of BDO. The Claimants requested that the Tribunal
order Romania to refrain from “(a) cancelling Multipack’s rescheduling agreement (b)
garnishing Multipack’s bank accounts and sending letters to third party garnishees; and (c)
initiating the seizure of European Food’s assets.” The Claimants stated that “[a]bsent the
requested order from the Tribunal, Romania will proceed with enforcement measures
immediately on 18 December 2017. Therefore, the requested order is necessary and urgent”

(emphasis in original).

On 15 December 2017, the Respondent requested leave to respond to the Claimants’ letter
of 14 December 2017 requesting urgent relief.

On 18 December 2017, ICSID notified the Parties that Dr. Pryles had confirmed that no
possible alterations in the number of sitting days or the sitting hours for the April 2018
fixture could enable him to attend the hearing as scheduled. His resignation of 1 December
2017 was therefore confirmed, and ICSID’s letter confirmed that, in accordance with
ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(2), the proceeding was suspended until the vacancy resulting
from Dr. Pryles’ resignation had been filled. The letter further informed the Parties that
Professor Crook and Professor McRae had consented to the resignation of Dr. Pryles from
the Tribunal and, accordingly, the vacancy on the Tribunal was now be filled by an
appointment made in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 11. Finally, the letter

recorded that:

125.

With respect to the Claimants’ open application for an urgent order
regarding pending enforcement proceedings, while no action can be
taken on the Claimants’ request until the Tribunal is reconstituted,
Professor McRae and Professor Crook have suggested that, if the
Respondent wishes to file observations on the Claimants’ request
(as it requested to do in its December 15, 2017 letter) and the
Parties agree, it should submit those observations to the ICSID
Secretariat, to be held pending the Tribunal’s reconstitution. Should
the Respondent wish to file observations in such manner, it is invited
to seek the consent of the Claimants, and inform the Secretariat of
the agreed date by which it will file those observations. Professor
McRae and Professor Crook have also asked us to communicate that
they encourage the Parties to endeavor to retain the status quo until
after the Tribunal has been reconstituted and can rule on the
Claimants’ application.

On 22 December 2017, the Respondent filed with ICSID its observations on the Claimants’
application of 14 December 2017 regarding the enforcement measures it was pursuing in

Romania.

Following appointment of Mr. John Beechey by the Claimants, the Tribunal was

reconstituted on 22 January 2018.

On 29 January 2018, the Respondents provided a further update on the enforcement
measures, indicating that the hearing for six of the insolvency proceedings was set for 8
March 2018 and that Romania had received another letter from the European Commission

which was provided to the Tribunal.

On 5 February 2018, the Claimants filed a new request for provisional measures, arguing
that Romania had violated the Tribunal’s previous order on provisional measures. After
detailing the impact of Romania’s enforcement measures on the Claimants’ business

activities, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to order that Respondent:

(a) refrain from taking any enforcement action in relation to debts
subject to Multipack’s invalidated debt restructuring agreement; (b,
cancel the current garnishment of Multipack’s bank accounts
ordered in Romania’s letter of 23 January 2018, and refrain from
transferring any money from the accounts named therein; and (c)
refrain from any future garnishment of Multipack’s bank accounts
or any other assets in recovery of the alleged State aid debt.

On 7 February 2018, the Parties submitted joint proposed amendments to the procedural
calendar, which included hearing dates in the weeks of 21 and 28 January 2019.

In accordance with the proposed modifications to the procedural timetable, on 9 February
2018, the Respondent filed its comments on the Second Expert Report of Ramona Maria
Milea of FinExpert.

On 12 February 2018, the Tribunal notified the Parties that their proposed agreed

modifications to the procedural calendar were adopted.

On 13 February 2018, the Respondent filed its observations on the Claimants’ 5 February
2018 request for provisional measures. The Respondent’s observations provided a further
update on the status of the enforcement measures and argued that Romania had not
breached the Tribunal’s orders as claimed by the Claimants. The Respondent reiterated its
position that Romania had obligations in accordance with EU and domestic law to recoup
the State aid from the Micula J claimants and the matter was not relevant to the proceeding
in this matter. On 19 February 2018, the Respondent provided a further update on the status

of the enforcement measures.

On 2 March 2018, the Claimants filed their response to the Respondent’s update of 19
February 2018. In it, the Claimants argued that the planned enforcement measures by
Romania were without basis and would have a negative impact on the Micula Companies.
The Claimants attached an impact analysis prepared by BDO, and requested that the

Tribunal order Romania to refrain from:

(a) issuing letters to any third-party of Scandic or any company in
which Scandic is a shareholder seizing payment due from such third
parties; (b) garnishing Multipack’s bank accounts and sending
letters to third party garnishees; and (c) continuing enforcement
procedures related to seized assets of European Food and
garnishing its bank accounts.

On 15 March 2018, the Tribunal issued its Second Decision on Enforcement Proceedings.

It made the following determinations:

a. The Tribunal declines to make the orders requested by the
Claimants in their letters of February 5, 2018 and March 2, 2018;

b. The Tribunal declines to grant the relief in the terms requested by
the Respondent in its letter of December 19, 2017 and reiterated in
its letter of February 13, 2018;

c. The Tribunal reiterates its Decisions of March 1, 2016, and
March 6, 2017;

d. It is appropriate for the Tribunal to call on Romania to exercise
restraint in its enforcement measures against the Claimants and
specifically, and to the extent that it is able to do so within the limits
of its own law, to delay any eventual enforcement, so far as the
Claimants are concerned during the pendency of these proceedings;
and

e. Costs shall be reserved until later in the proceedings.

By email of 16 April 2018, the Respondent provided a further update on the status of the
enforcement measures. The Claimants filed their observations to the Respondent’s update

on 27 April 2018.

On 11 May 2018, the Respondent requested leave to file a new jurisdictional objection

based on the Achmea Decision together with Legal Authorities RL-115 to RL-118.

On 25 May 2018, the Claimants filed their Reply to the Respondent’s request of 11 May
2018.

On 5 June 2018, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 13 granting leave to the
Respondent to file submissions on the impact on these proceedings of the decision in
Achmea. In granting this request, however, the Tribunal made no decision on the question
of whether a jurisdictional objection could be raised at this stage of the proceedings. The
Tribunal noted that a decision on that matter would be taken in the light of the further

submissions of the Parties.

On | August 2018, the Respondent filed an Additional Preliminary Objection together with
Annexes Nos. | and 2, Exhibits R-446 to R-457 and Legal Authorities RL-119 to RL- 153.

On 17 September 2018, the Claimants filed their Reply to the Respondent’s Additional
Preliminary Objection together with Exhibits C-476 to C-478 and Legal Authorities CL-
182 to CL-235.

By letter of 25 September 2018, the Tribunal notified the Parties that it had “considered
the Parties’ submissions on the admissibility of Respondent’s objection and on the impact
of the Achmea Decision, and has decided to defer to the merits hearing its decision on
admissibility of Respondent’s objection and, if admissible, the merits of that objection.” In
its letter, the Tribunal also advised the Parties that it did not require any further written
submissions on these issues and that the Parties could present oral arguments during the

Hearing on the Merits scheduled for January 2019.

On 3 October 2018, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, requesting a second round of
written submissions on its Additional Preliminary Objection. The Respondent indicated
that it had approached the Claimants to seek agreement to have a second round of written
pleadings and the Claimants did not consent. In the alternative, the Respondent requested
that the Tribunal grant it leave to file new legal authorities before the hearing of oral

arguments.

By letter of 8 October 2018, the Claimant responded to the Respondent’s request of 3
October 2018, stating that a second round of written submissions on the Respondent’s
Preliminary Objection was not necessary, would negatively impact preparation for the
Hearing and would prejudice the Claimants. The Claimants did not oppose Romania’s

alternative request for leave to file new legal authorities on the matter.

Ina separate letter of same date, the Claimants requested leave to submit into the record “a
limited number of additional documents” described in Annex A to the letter. The Claimants

stated the reasons for its request to be:

(i) Romania, in connection with the filing of its Rejoinder,
introduced new expert testimony (including the expert reports of

30

142.

143.

Professors Mihdilescu and Kopczuk) and new evidence supporting
factual assertions and arguments made in the Rejoinder and Dr
Cohen's Second Report;

(ii) It has transpired that Romania, as part of the more than 100,000
pages produced in response to Claimants’ Document Requests 6-9,
erroneously has produced documents responsive to other Document
Requests; and

(iii) Documents relevant to the case did not exist at the time

Claimants filed their Reply.
The Claimants contended that the submission of these documents would not prejudice the
Respondent, as it would have an opportunity to address them at the Hearing in January

2019.

In its letter of 19 October 2018, the Respondent objected to the Claimants’ application to
submit additional documents. The Respondent argued that the scope of the request went
beyond a “limited number of additional documents” and encompassed “vast quantities of
new data, two new expert reports, several broadly defined categories of documents [...]
and several further pleadings described as ‘summary overviews’.” The Respondent

contended that the Claimants did not have any basis to submit these new documents.

Following further exchanges between the Parties, by letter of 14 November 2018, the
Tribunal granted leave to the Claimants to file limited documents: 1) documents relevant
to updating the Claimants’ damages; and 2) a short update to the Brattle Expert Report with
limited annexes. After receiving that update, and in consultation with the Parties, the
Tribunal would decide whether to grant the Respondent a chance to respond in advance of
the Hearing so that the update might be addressed during the Hearing or whether that
response should be postponed until after the Hearing, with a potential of reconvening the
hearing at a later point. The Tribunal invited the Claimants to further identify the
documents that were directly responsive to new issues raised in the Respondent’s Rejoinder

and not simply responsive to the Respondent’s rebuttal of the Claimants’ arguments.

Thereafter, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 14 concerning the organization of

the hearing on 15 November 2018.

In accordance with the Tribunal’s instructions of 14 November 2018, by letter of 16
November 2018, the Claimants identified the documents for submission into the record

that in their view met the criteria set out by the Tribunal.

32

147.

148.

149.

150.

151.

152.

On 20 November 2018, following an invitation from the Tribunal to submit brief comments
on the Claimants’ letter of 16 November 2018, the Respondent stated that none of
documents identified by the Claimants in their letter met the criteria set by the Tribunal
and requested that the Tribunal reject the Claimants’ requests to submit additional

documents.

On 21 November 2018, after reviewing the Parties’ arguments concerning the additional
documents identified in the Claimants’ letter of 16 November 2018, the Tribunal decided
to grant leave to the Claimants to submit those documents. The Tribunal reserved the right
to revisit the issue of the documents’ relevance and weight in light of the arguments to be

presented by the Parties.

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 14, on 3 December 2018, the Parties submitted
additional legal authorities: RL-154 and RL-155 submitted by the Respondent and CL-238
and CL-239 submitted by the Claimants.

On 5 December 2018, in accordance with the Tribunal’s decisions of 14 and 21 November
2018, the Claimants submitted additional documents: Exhibits C-479 through C-488 and
CER-13, CURS Updated Report.

On 10 December 2018, in accordance with the Tribunal’s decision of 14 November 2018,
the Claimants submitted CER-14, the updated Brattle Group Report with appendices CER-
14-001 to CER-14-018 (the “Updated Brattle Report”).

By letter of 17 December 2018, the Respondent submitted its comments on the procedure
for responding to the Updated Brattle Report. The Respondent asserted that the updated
report went beyond the scope of the leave granted by the Tribunal. The Respondent
indicated that its expert, Dr. Cohen, considered he would need a significant amount of time
to complete his review of the new data submitted and to provide an update, and that this
work could not take place simultaneously with preparations for the hearing. The
Respondent requested that the Tribunal decide, following the hearing, an appropriate date

for the Respondent’s response in consultation with the Parties.

153.

154.

155.

156.

157.

On 20 December 2018, at the Tribunal’s invitation, the Claimants submitted their
observations on the Respondent’s letter of 17 December 2018. The Claimants asserted that
the Updated Brattle Report fully complied with the scope of the leave granted by the
Tribunal and characterized Dr. Cohen’s estimates of the time needed to complete his
analysis as “exaggerated and unreasonable.” The Claimants requested the Tribunal to
direct submission of Dr. Cohen’s rebuttal report by 17 January 2019 at the latest, and to
provide directions clarifying the scope and length of that rebuttal report. The Claimants
also reserved their right to call Dr. Cohen for cross-examination, in the event that he was

permitted to submit his rebuttal report after the hearing.

On 21 December 2018, the Respondent filed a request to submit, as a new exhibit, the full
translation of one of the new exhibits submitted by the Claimants. The Respondent’s letter
further addressed the Claimant’s comments regarding the timing of Dr. Cohen’s response

to the Updated Brattle Report.

By letter of 21 December 2018 the Tribunal granted leave to the Respondent to submit a
full translation of the document filed by the Claimants as C-485. It further decided that any
“consideration of the time frame for and modalities of response by the Respondent to the
Updated Brattle Group Report and any issues arising out of the documents produced by the
Claimants on 5 December 2018” was to be deferred until the Hearing. The Tribunal advised

the Parties that no further communications on these matters were required at that time.

On 8 January 2019, the Respondent submitted Exhibit R-458, in accordance with the leave
granted on 21 December 2018. Respondent also requested leave to submit a small number
of additional documents. The Claimants confirmed they had no objections to this on 10
January 2019; later that same day the Tribunal confirmed they would be admitted to the
record. Respondent’s Exhibits R-459 to R-468 were duly submitted on 14 January 2019.

On 11 January 2019, the Parties, in accordance with the Tribunal’s instructions of 9
October 2018, each submitted some further legal authorities relating to the Respondent’s
Additional Preliminary Objection (CL-0240 through CL00242 and RL-0158 through RL-

0161, respectively). The Claimants also requested leave to submit a further legal authority;

158.

159.

160.

161.

that leave was granted on 15 January 2019, and the authority submitted as CL-0243 on 16
January 2019.

On 14 January 2019, the Parties submitted their respective skeleton arguments. The
Claimants’ accompanying letter submitted an updated Prayer for Relief in which the
quantum of Claimants’ total damages claim was reduced in light of the Updated Brattle

Report.

Also, on 14 January 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that its expert, Professor
Mihiilescu had been hospitalized and would be unable to travel to Paris for the hearing. It
requested the postponement of his examination. The following day, the Claimants and the

Tribunal concurred that the issue would best be discussed at the hearing.

On 18 and 29 January 2019, the Respondent filed additional Legal Authorities RL-156
through RL-163.

A hearing on the Merits was held in Paris, France, from 21 January to 1 February 2019 (the

“Hearing”). The following persons were present at the Hearing:

At the Hearing, the Respondent submitted additional Legal Authorities RL-164 and RL-
165.

Following the hearing, by letter of 5 February 2019, the Tribunal confirmed the subsequent
procedural steps as discussed with the Parties during the last day of the Hearing. The
Tribunal granted leave to the Respondent to file a third expert report from Dr. Cohen in
response to the Claimants’ Updated Brattle report and directed the Parties to agree on the
scope of that report. The Parties were advised to reserve 26 and 27 June 2019 for a possible
further hearing on quantum and were invited to advise the Tribunal whether the Claimants
wished to cross-examine Dr. Cohen regarding his third expert report and for the
Respondent to confirm whether Prof. Mihailescu would be able to appear at the June
hearing for cross-examination. Finally, the Parties were instructed to submit any

corrections to their respective quantum experts’ reports in the form of errata sheets.

On 6 February 2019, the Respondent submitted an errata sheet to Dr. Cohen’s second
expert report.

By letter of 7 February 2019, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal decide on the
Additional Preliminary Objection submitted by the Respondent on | August 2018 as a

preliminary matter, as it pertained to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction or lack thereof.

167.

168.

In a letter of 8 February 2019, the Respondent advised the Tribunal that the Parties were
unable to reach an agreement on the scope of Dr. Cohen’s third report (the “Rebuttal
Report”). The Respondent stressed that the scope of the Rebuttal Report was already
limited to responding to the latest Brattle report, and argued that limiting the scope further
was inappropriate and might prevent Dr. Cohen from responding and addressing certain
issues present in, or arising from, the Brattle report. The Respondent also discussed the
scope of the possible further hearing, noting that at the time of the January Hearing, it had
not had an opportunity to examine the latest Brattle report and, therefore, had not been in
a position to cross-examine the Claimants’ quantum expert on that report. The Respondent
argued that it would not be fair if it was deprived of an opportunity to cross-examine the
Claimants’ expert while the Claimants were allowed to cross-examine Dr. Cohen on his

Rebuttal Report.

On the same day, the Claimants submitted their observations regarding the scope of the
Rebuttal Report. The Claimants noted that the Updated Brattle Report dealt with only a
limited number of issues largely pertaining to updating calculations, so the Rebuttal Report
should be confined to a limited number of topics and not exceed 20 pages. The Claimants
listed specific topics on which Dr. Cohen should comment and requested that the Tribunal
“issue directions reflecting the limitations [...] as to the scope of the [Rebuttal Report].”
The Claimants further discussed the Respondent’s request to cross-examine the Claimants’
quantum expert on the basis of the Updated Brattle Report. The Claimants noted that the
Tribunal had not indicated that the hearing would reconvene; it had only identified a
possibility of holding a further hearing if necessary. The Claimants further argued that the
Updated Brattle Report was submitted on 10 December 2018 and the Respondent had had
six weeks before the hearing to review it. It was the Respondent’s decision not to cross-
examine Brattle on the updated report even though the Tribunal, in its Procedural Order
No. 14, had expressly directed the Parties “to come to the hearing prepared to make their
full case.” The Respondent was given a fair opportunity to cross-examine the expert, but
chose not to. The Claimants accordingly requested that the Respondent’s request for

another cross-examination be denied.

169. By letter of 12 February 2019, the Tribunal addressed the Parties’ comments regarding the
scope of the Rebuttal Report. It noted that the Claimants’ request of 8 October 2018 to
update the Brattle Report listed the scope of such update and, in granting the Claimants’
request, the Tribunal stated that the updated report should be short with limited annexes.
In the Tribunal’s view, the same limitations should be applied to the Rebuttal Report, which
should only deal with issues in the Updated Brattle Report. It should deal with earlier expert
reports only to the extent necessary to respond to the Updated Brattle Report. The Tribunal
directed that that the Rebuttal Report be short with limited annexes. On the matter of cross-
examination of the Claimants’ quantum expert, the Tribunal noted that it was reasonable
to consider that if the Respondent was not in a position to respond in writing to the Updated
Brattle Report before the Hearing, it was also not in a position to cross-examine the
Claimants’ expert on that report at the Hearing. The Tribunal, therefore, decided that each
Party had “the right to cross-examine the other’s expert on the matters contained in their

respective final reports.”

170. On 12 February 2019, the Claimants submitted their comments to the Respondent’s letter
of 7 February 2019 regarding the Additional Preliminary Objection, contending that the
Tribunal should dismiss the Objection. First, the Claimants argued that the Objection was
untimely pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 21(1) and should be dismissed for that reason.
The Claimants argued further that Romania could not unilaterally withdraw its consent to
arbitrate and, contrary to the Respondent’s assertion, that an exchange of letters between
Romania and Sweden did not “reflect a subsequent agreement on the interpretation of the
BIT within the meaning of Article 31(3)(a) of [the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties (“VCLT”)°], and that the declarations adopted by a number of EU countries
including Romania and Sweden did not constitute treaties. The Claimant further noted that
the Tribunal should deal with the Objection “in any manner it deems appropriate” and the

Claimant “would not object to the Tribunal issuing a separate decision on jurisdiction.”

171. By letter of 13 February 2019, the Tribunal notified the Parties that it would deal with both

the issues of jurisdiction and merits in its Award.

On 6 March 2019, the European Commission (the “EC”) filed an Application for Leave to
Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party, together with Annexes | to 6 (the “EC Application”).

On 7 March 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their comments to the EC

Application.

On 8 March 2019, the Parties submitted the list of their agreed and disagreed corrections
to the Hearing transcripts and asked the Tribunal to decide on corrections about which they

disagreed.

On 22 March 2019, each Party submitted its observations on the EC Application. The
Respondent supported the EC’s Application, contending that it met the requirements of
ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) as it would bring particular knowledge relevant to the impact
of the Achmea Decision on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the EC’s intervention would address
a matter within the scope of the dispute, especially in light of the Respondent’s pending
Additional Preliminary Objection, and the EC had a significant interest in the proceeding
as “guardian of the treaties.” Respondent added that the EC’s intervention would not
disrupt the proceeding. The Respondent also agreed to grant the EC access to certain case
materials to allow it to file a more focused submission. The Respondent filed additional

Legal Authorities RL-166 through RL-172 along with its observations.

The Claimants, on the other hand, objected to the EC Application, arguing that it would
“severely disrupt” the proceeding. The Claimants noted that this proceeding commenced
in 2014, and that it was “implausible” that the EC was not aware of it. Therefore, the
application to intervene was inexcusable at this late stage. The Claimants further argued
that the intervention would prejudice them and would not assist the Tribunal, as the Parties
had addressed the topic of the Achmea Decision at length in their submissions. The EC
would not present any new perspective or knowledge and had failed to demonstrate that it
had any significant interest in this dispute. The Claimants’ comments were accompanied

by additional Legal Authorities CL-244, CL-245, CL-246, and CL-489 through CL-492.

On 29 March 2019, in accordance with the Tribunal’s invitation, the Respondent submitted

its reply comments on the Claimants’ observations to the EC Application, asserting that

41

178.

179.

180.

181.

the Claimants’ arguments “lack[ed] merit.” The Respondent argued that the mere fact that
the issue of the Achmea Decision had already been briefed by the Parties did not mean that
the EC would not bring a particular knowledge relevant to the same issue. The Respondent
further stressed that the EC had a significant interest as a “guardian” of EU treaties and in
“preventing conflicts between arbitral awards and EU law.” It continued, “[t]he potential
conflict would also affect the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and the Claimants’ ability to enforce
an award.” The Respondent also argued that the intervention would not disrupt the

proceedings and would not unduly burden or unfairly prejudice the Parties.

By email of the same date, the Claimants maintained their position on the EC Application
as presented in their submission of 22 March 2019 and noted that “Romania’s observations

of the same date do not show that the Commission would present any new point.”

On 12 April 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 regarding the EC
Application. While it observed that the Application met the requirements of Rule 37(2)(b)
and (c), the Tribunal noted that the issues in respect of which the EC sought to intervene
had been fully briefed by the Parties and it was doubtful that the EC’s submission would
materially assist the Tribunal on those issues. The Tribunal further noted that the Hearing
on the merits had already taken place, and that the Tribunal had a duty to ensure that the
proceeding was not disrupted and the Parties not unduly burdened. The Tribunal also found
that the EC’s contention that it did not have knowledge of the status of the arbitration as
not a sufficient justification; the record of the proceeding showed the EC’s awareness of
this arbitration. Based on those conclusions, the Tribunal denied the EC’s Application to

intervene.

The EC was notified of the Tribunal’s decision by letter of 12 April 2019. On the same
day, the EC replied taking note of the decision. It asked the Tribunal to keep the EC’s
Application on file.

On 30 April 2019, the Respondent filed Dr. Cohen’s Rebuttal Report together with Exhibits
RC-3-001, RC-3-003, RC-3-005 through RC-3-009, RC-3-015 through RC-3-017, RC-3-
032, RC-3-040, RC-3-042, RC-3-053, RC-3-062, RC-3-063, RC-3-074, RC-3-077, RC-3-

186.

By letter of 14 May 2019, the Claimants advised the Tribunal that they did not seek to
cross-examine Dr. Cohen regarding his Rebuttal Report. However, the Claimants reserved
the right to call him for cross-examination if the Respondent decided to call the Brattle
expert for cross-examination. The Claimants also noted that the Rebuttal Report exceeded
the limited scope as set by the Tribunal. The Claimants further mentioned that the
Romanian courts had recently dismissed the insolvency proceedings upon which the
Respondent had relied in its cross-examination at the Hearing. The Claimants reiterated
their position that those proceedings were “irrelevant to the issues presented and the

insinuations advanced by Romania based on them are impertinent and unfounded.”

By letter of same date, the Respondent advised the Tribunal that Prof. Mihailescu would
not be able to travel to Paris for a hearing, but he would be able to appear for cross-
examination by a video-link if necessary. And, while he was available at the proposed
hearing dates, the Respondent could not guarantee that he would continue to be available

if any medical exigency arose.

On 16 May 2019, the Respondent notified the Tribunal that it did not seek to cross-examine
Brattle as Dr. Cohen’s Rebuttal Report sufficiently addressed the Updated Brattle Report.
It further addressed the Claimants’ argument on the scope of Dr. Cohen’s report,
contending that it did not exceed the scope as outlined in the Tribunal’s Order of 12
February 2019 and “it merely updates the analysis in the Second [Report of Dr. Cohen] in
light of the Third Brattle Report and the new data on which it relies.” The Respondent also
addressed the Claimants’ assertion regarding the Romanian insolvency proceedings, noting
that the court had not yet issued the reasons for its decision and that those proceedings were

“far from irrelevant” as contended by the Claimants.

By letter of 23 May 2019, the Tribunal took note of the Parties’ respective decisions not to
cross-examine each other’s quantum experts, but it observed that Prof. Mihailescu would
be available for cross-examination and invited the Claimants to indicate whether they

wished to proceed with that cross-examination.

On 29 May 2019, the Claimants responded to the Tribunal’s inquiry, noting that the

Respondent could not guarantee that Prof. Mihailescu would be available on the proposed

43

187.

188.

189.

hearing dates. The Claimants stated that “the time and cost for preparing and conducting a
proper video hearing [...] are not justifiable (sic) considering [...] the apparent risk [...]
that Professor Mihailescu may not be able to participate.” The Claimants, therefore,
requested that the Tribunal either strike Prof. Mihailescu’s report from the record or, in the
alternative, grant the Claimants leave to submit written comments to his report. The
Claimants further asked the Tribunal to fix the date for the submission of the Parties’

statements of costs.

On 3 June 2019, the Respondent responded to the Claimants’ letter of 29 May 2019,
arguing that the Claimants’ requests to strike Prof. Mihailescu’s report from the record or
to have leave to file yet another submission were “misguided.” The Respondent pointed
out that it was the Claimants’ choice not to call Prof. Mihailescu despite the fact that the
Respondent had made him available for examination. The Respondent further noted that
making “‘a further submission on the Mihailescu Report in lieu of cross-examination” was
misguided, because “a written submission is not a substitute for testing evidence by way

of cross-examination.”

On 7 June 2019, the Claimants responded to the Respondent’s observations. The Claimants
contended that because of the conditions and qualifications placed by the Respondent upon
his appearance, the Respondent had not, in fact, made Prof. Mihailescu available. When
considering the options available to them, the Claimants questioned whether “the time and
cost of a separate examination of Professor Mihailescu [was] justified,” given the
uncertainty as to his availability. The Claimants maintained their request to strike his expert
report from the record or, in the alternative, that they be granted leave to file a short

submission responding to that report.

On 11 June 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 16 regarding the Claimants’
requests of 29 May 2019. The Tribunal observed the Prof. Mihailescu’s inability to attend
the Hearing had arisen through no fault of his own. While Prof. Mihailescu had indicated
his willingness to appear for cross-examination, there was no guarantee that by the time
arrangements were made, he would be able to participate. In this regard, the Tribunal

agreed that it would not be appropriate for the Claimants to assume the burden of making

7 Given the conclusions reached by the Tribunal on the merits of the Claime
need to address the question of the weight to be given to Prof. Mihailes

arrangements for cross-examination that might not happen. However, the Tribunal also saw
no basis to strike the entirety of Prof. Mihailescu’s report from the record, as the Tribunal
could derive some assistance from it. The Tribunal, therefore, decided to grant the
Claimants leave to submit brief observations on Professor Mihailescu’s report “reflecting

the questions that would have been raised with Professor Mihailescu.””

On 21 June 2019, the Claimants submitted their observations upon Prof. Mihailescu’s

expert report.

On 3 July 2019, at the invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent submitted brief comments

on the Claimants’ 21 June 2019 observations.

On 30 August 2019, in accordance with the Parties’ agreed timetable, the Claimants filed
their Statement of Costs, together with Annexes | to 3 and Legal Authorities CL-246
through CL-252. On the same day, the Respondent filed its Statement of Costs together

with Annexes | and 2.

On 13 September 2019, each party filed observations upon the Statement of Costs of the

other.

The proceeding was closed on 21 February 2020.

DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR ALCOHOL SECTOR IN ROMANIA —
EARLY 1990s

Until the 1989 revolution, Romania was a communist dictatorship. At the time of the
revolution, Romania had one of the most controlled and centralised economies in Central
and Eastern Europe. Thus, after the revolution, the State faced the significant challenge of

integrating Romania’s economy into the greater world economy.*®

In the early 1990s, Romania undertook wide scale economic reform, involving, inter alia,
the privatization of the country’s alcohol industry and the modernization of the regulatory
framework, which governed it. Pursuant to Law 15/1990, State enterprises involved in the
production of food products (including alcohol) were converted into joint-stock companies.
As a consequence, at the end of 1990, twelve State-owned companies were formed, which

supplied ethyl alcohol to the entire alcohol industry in Romania.”

In 1991, Romania continued on the path of increased privatization, enacting legislation
pursuant to which, 30% of the shares of these newly formed companies were to be
transferred to five “private regional ownership funds.”!° At the same time, Romania
enacted legislation to attract capital and foreign investment, specifically Law 96/1990 and
Law 35/1991.!! Finally, also in 1991, Romania made the first significant amendment to
the post-communist legislative regime for the alcohol sector, through GD 779/1991. That
law required both domestic producers and importers to pay an ad valorem tax on goods,

calculated as a percentage of the sales price on sales to the distributor. !?

In 1993, Romania entered into the “Europe Agreement” with the EU Member States, a
formal pre-accession agreement aimed to facilitate Romania’s accession to the EU. The
Europe Agreement provided the legal framework for the accession process and relations

between Romania and the EU Member States, and was scheduled to come into force in

February 1995.'> Romania was required by the Europe Agreement, inter alia, further to

develop its legal framework in order to align its laws with those in the EU.'*

In accordance with this requirement, in July 1993 the ad valorem taxes on alcohol and
derivative products were raised from 60% to 100% of sales price and the sanctions and
penalties for non-compliance were enhanced.'> At around the same time, tax rates for other
categories and sub-categories of alcohol saw further changes.!* In 1995, preparation of a
new Government Ordinance (GO 23/1995) commenced, in order to introduce a new legal
framework for excisable products, including alcohol. The new legal regime introduced an
obligatory labelling system to enhance the administration and monitoring of the payment
and collection of excise taxes, strictly prohibited the sale of unlabelled products, and further

increased fines for violations. It entered into force in May 1998.'7

CLAIMANTS’ EARLY INVESTMENTS IN ROMANIA (1990 — 1997)

Mr. Ioan Micula registered the company TGIE in Bihor County, Romania, in October 1990.
He was joined by his brother, Mr. Viorel Micula in that enterprise. Initially, the Micula
brothers, through TGIE, engaged in importing a variety of consumer products from
Western Europe. In 1992, the Micula brothers created a joint venture, S.C Stroh
Transilvania S.R.L. (“Stroh Transilvania”), together with Austrian liqueur manufacturer,
Sebastian Stroh, to introduce the alcoholic drink “Swedish Bitter” into the Romanian

market. !*

In 1993, the Micula brothers set up an additional company, European Drinks, principally
to facilitate the production of Tetra Pack packaging for their beverage products. European

Drinks produced, inter alia, the drink “Scandic Pop Vodka.”!? Over time, the Claimants

built an extensive spirits brands portfolio, as well as a portfolio of non-alcoholic beverage
products.”° In pursuit of an integrated business model and enhanced cost-efficiency,
additional companies were created to produce intermediate industrial products for the
group’s supply chain. Thus, Tonical Trading, Reini Drinks and Edri Trading were set up
in 1994.7! In addition, in 1995 the Claimants commenced the construction of a distillery
in Draganesti in Bihor County (a major capital investment) to facilitate the production of
ethyl alcohol, further reducing overall manufacturing costs. Construction was completed

in 1997.72

DEVELOPMENT OF THE MINERAL WATER PROJECT (1997-2001)

In the mid-1990s, the Romanian Government announced its intention to develop a mineral
water spring located in the West Carpathian Mountains. It began to look for an investor to
invest in the project. In March 1997, European Drinks entered into a long-term sale and
purchase contract, commercial contract no. 16828/04.03.1997, with the Autonomous
Administration of Mineral Waters of Romania for the acquisition of mineral water from
the natural spring Izvorul Minunilor — Stana de Vale (the “Mineral Water Contract”). The
Mineral Water Contract stipulated a fixed price of ROL 10.10 per litre, although the price
was subject to “[...] change at intervals correlated with the influences of the economy,” by
written agreement of the parties in the form of addenda to the Contract. In December of
that year, Romania assigned the rights of the Autonomous Administration of Mineral
Waters under the Mineral Water Contract to the state-owned National Company of Mineral
Water (“SNAM”). Further to the Mineral Water Contract, European Drinks and other
Micula Companies constructed pressurized pipelines located within an underground tunnel

and built bottling facilities in Rieni and Draganesti. Commercial production of mineral

CHANGES TO THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK (1998-2003)

From 1998, Romania continued to develop its legislation, including legislation applicable

to the alcohol industry, to prepare for its accession into the EU.

In 1998, Romania adopted Emergency Government Ordinance (“EGO”) 82/1997, which
replaced the previous ad valorem tax system. The new tax system introduced a fixed tax
rate to be paid by alcohol producers on the quantity of produced alcohol and regulated
fiscal audits and supervision. The same year, as noted above, the new tax label system came

into effect.24

In addition, EGO 50/1998 introduced a new system for fiscal supervision to ensure
compliance with the 1998 tax regime. Producers were obliged to use specific invoices for
the production and sale of products, and the legislation introduced a mandatory requirement
that all commercial actors engaged in the sale of alcohol be authorized to do so. The system
also regulated production activities by imposing mandatory reporting obligations, requiring
the installation of “counters” to monitor each step of the distillation process, and
designating fiscal supervisors for each producer. The import and transportation of
alcoholic drinks in bulk was regulated through mandated importation licenses, use of
customs authority seals, and the recording of imported quantities in a special registry. The
production of traditional brandies (e.g., tuica) was regulated by mandating producers to
register production equipment, observe reporting obligations, and have their equipment
formally sealed and unsealed by legal regulatory authorities, who were to record such
activity in a special register. These regulations were supported by criminal sanctions for

violations.°

In 1999, the EU decided to start formal bilateral negotiations with Romania in February
2000. The process required lengthy negotiations and substantial changes in the domestic

Romanian market.”

Chapter 10 - Taxation, dated 24 July 2001, p. 10,

The increases of taxes on alcohol in 1998 led to a rise in black market activities within the
sector. To address this, in February 2000, Romania adopted GO 27/2000, which inter alia
established a minimum sales price for alcoholic drinks to facilitate identification of black
market products, and imposed sanctions for non-compliance. In October 2000, GO
27/2000 was amended and supplemented by EGO 134/2000, which banned most bulk sales
of spirits, introduced further monitoring regimes and decreased the excise tax. The
following year, EGO 117/2001 further amended the regime, introducing measures to

enhance monitoring and fiscal control.”

In October 2000, Romania adopted EGO 181/2000, which introduced a State monopoly
system requiring producers to sell to the State, which would then sell alcohol to distributers
at a price that included relevant taxes. EGO 181/200 further sanctioned any unauthorized
sale or circulation of alcohol among commercial actors. Two months later, in December

2000, Romania further reduced the applicable tax rates.?*

In 2001, Romania, in anticipation of its accession to the European Union, submitted a
Position Paper to the EU, requesting “‘a transition period of 5 years, until 31 December
2011 for the implementation of the minimum level of excise duties provided by Article 3
of Directive 92/84/EEC for the subgroup ‘alcohol and alcoholic beverages’.”° In the two

years that followed, Romania made minor tax increases.*°

In 2002, home production of alcohol, except for private use, was forbidden and all
commercial producers were brought within the registration regime. This change did not

impact the right to produce for home consumption.*!

F. FURTHER REGULATORY CHANGES (2003 AND AFTER)

213. A number of regulatory changes were commenced in 2003.

214. In mid-2003, following pressure from the EU, Romania informed the EU that it had

reviewed its position and wished to withdraw its earlier request for a five-year transitional

period (i.e., until 31 December 2011) to implement the minimum level of alcohol excise

duties applicable under EU law.** In pursuance of the objective of reaching the EU-

mandated levels for excise duties, successive increases to the excise rates were made in

July 2003, July 2004, April 2005, May 2006 and July 2006. Over this three-year period,

the excise tax rate increased by almost 700%."4 The excise rate then remained unchanged
until August 2013, when it temporarily increased before reverting to the prior rate in

January 2016.45

In addition, in December 2003, Romania enacted Law 571/2003 (the “2004 Tax Code”),
which was intended to harmonize all excise duty legislation in the framework of a single
fiscal code, including rules concerning labelling, manufacturing, taxation, control,
violations and sanctions relating to the alcohol industry. This detailed legislation, which
brought Romania’s regulatory framework into line with the EU regime, increased the
regulations applicable to Romanian alcohol producers, including through the introduction
of a new “fiscal warehouse” regime. This required all production, processing and storage
of excisable products, such as alcohol, to take place in an authorized “fiscal warehouse”
and mandated that all labelling of alcoholic products be carried out by authorized

warehouse keepers.*®

This new regime required producers to obtain fiscal warehouse authorization (or, in the
case of individual households producing beer, wine, fermented drinks or plum or fruit
brandy for sale, “individual producer permits”), and to comply with a number of ongoing
requirements with respect to the maintenance and operation of the warehouse. It also
required all producers (including household producers) to register with the Ministry of
Public Finances (“MPF”), and mandated that sales of alcohol produced in still pots could
only be made to authorized fiscal warehouse operators, effectively outlawing alcohol sales

by individual household producers (unless they had the fiscal warehouse authorization).*”

Finally, the 2004 Tax Code provided for detailed rules concerning the fiscal monitoring of
the alcohol market. It introduced stricter rules regarding the sales of alcohol in bulk,
codified pre-existing regulations on the supervision of the import and export of alcohol and

individual production of natural brandies, and established general rules concerning the

control of the alcohol sector. It also introduced a series of additional acts considered illegal

under the new regime and expanded the available penalties for infractions.**

In 2004, a number of laws were passed further regulating the alcohol industry, including
with respect to adherence to food safety, hygiene, environmental, and occupational and fire
safety laws. These laws brought Romanian regulations further in line with EC

requirements. *?

Also, in 2004, Romania codified in GO 83/2004 a full tax exemption for unlimited amounts
of plum and fruit brandy produced for personal consumption. This measure differed from
the proposed exemption Romania had sought from the EU (namely a tax rate equal to 50%
of the commercial tax rate for household production, with an annual production limit of
SOL of fruit spirits with 40% alcohol content). Subsequently, the EU, following
negotiations with Romania, approved in Council Directive 92/83/EEC the requested
exemption, which was to be in place by the time of accession, without specifying any
alcohol content percentage. In February 2005, at the EU’s behest, the rules were amended
to introduce a quantitative limit of 300L per year. In January 2007, the previously agreed
50% tax obligation was imposed on volumes of up to 50L per household per year, with
alcoholic concentration of 100% by volume — extending the excise tax regime to the
household production market for the first time. Romania acceded to the EU in 2007, and
in October 2008 a full tax exemption for household consumption for the production of no
less than 250 litres of pure alcohol was approved (coming into force in November 2009).

That exemption was wound back in April 2010.°°

Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 brought about an important change

to the excise tax regime: the implementation of the EU-wide Excise Movement Control

System (“EMCS”). The Directive was implemented into Romanian law by GEO
109/2009.5!

In 2014 and 2015, the Romanian Government worked on rewriting the 2004 Tax Code and
facilitated a public consultation process in this regard. The 2016 Fiscal Code was approved

by Law No. 227/2015, which took effect on 1 January 2016.°?

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ROMANIAN SPIRITS MARKET FROM 2004

In the period from around 2004, the recorded legal volumes of alcohol produced in
Romania dropped, as did the number of registered producers on the market.** The extent
to which recorded volumes of alcohol produced outside of the legal market increased
during this time period, and the cause for these market changes, is the subject of dispute

between the Parties, and is addressed as relevant in the Tribunal’s analysis below.

CHANGES TO THE MINERAL WATER CONTRACT

In December 2001, six months after the commercial production of water under the Mineral
Water Contract began, the Government enacted an emergency ordinance, regulated by the
Romanian Competition Office, which had the effect of imposing controls on prices of
mineral water at source. In accordance with this regime, SNAM successfully asked the
Competition Office to increase the price for mineral water at the source. In February 2002,
SNAM notified European Drinks that the price of mineral water at the source under the
Contract would increase from ROL 10.10/L to ROL 60/L. Beginning in June of that year,
European Foods repeatedly notified SNAM of its position that this price revision was in
breach of the Contract and Romanian law. Between 2002 and 2015, SNAM changed the
price on six occasions, with the latest modification being notified in October 2015. In
January 2007, European Foods signed an amendment to the Contract, which included a

new contract price. However, it did so under protest, specifying its disagreement with the

specified in the Contract, until a Romanian Court judgment upheld the position taken by
SNAM.™

OTHER EVENTS

Certain other events in Romania in the years after 2011 are alleged to have impacted several
of the Corporate Claimants. In particular, in December 2012, audits of Scandic’s
denaturation processes took place. Prior to a March 2015 decision of the High Court of
Cassation and Justice, Romania had not applied tax amnesty laws to Claimants’
investments, giving rise to additional tax liability for the Claimants. In October and
November 2015, Scandic’s fiscal warehouse license was revoked, its production facilities
were sealed and TGIE’s debt rescheduling agreements were revoked. Finally, Romania
resisted making payment in accordance with the award in the Micula v Romania I
arbitration to five of the Claimants in this arbitration, who (or which) were also party to

the earlier arbitration.*

THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF
The Claimants’ request for relief, as submitted by letter on 14 January 2019, is as follows:
Claimants respectfully request the Arbitral Tribunal to:

(i) DECLARE that Romania has breached its obligations towards
Claimants under the BIT;

(ii) ORDER Romania to pay to Claimants damages resulting from
Romania’s breaches, relating to Claimants’ spirits business, in the
amount of RON 9,082.4 million (which amount includes pre-award
interest accrued as of 30 November 2018), as follows: to Mr Ioan
Micula 40% of the amount just stated, to Mr Viorel Micula 40% of
the amount just stated and to the Corporate Claimants 20% of that
amount;

417-432.

 

55 Cl. Mem., paras. 433-446.

(iii) ORDER Romania to pay to Claimants damages resulting from
Romania’s breaches, relating to Claimants’ mineral water business,
in the amount of RON 39.4 million (which amount includes pre-
award interest accrued as of 30 November 2018), as follows: to Mr
Joan Micula 40% of the amount just stated, to Mr Viorel Micula
40% of the amount just stated and to the Corporate Claimants 20%
of that amount;

(iv) ORDER Romania to pay the expenses incurred by the Claimants
in connection with these proceedings, including professional fees
and disbursements, and to pay the fees and expenses of the Members
of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the
Centre, in accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention;

(v) ORDER Romania to pay interest on all sums awarded at a rate
of 3-month ROBOR plus 10%, compounded on a quarterly basis, as
from the date of the arbitral award until the date of full payment.

(vi) ORDER such other relief as the Tribunal may deem just and
proper.

226. The Respondent’s request for relief as set forth most recently in its Rejoinder is as follows:
[...] the Respondent respectfully asks the Tribunal to:

a) Dismiss the mineral water claim, and all the claims of Tonical
Trading, for lack of jurisdiction;

b) Dismiss all the claims of Messrs loan and Viorel Micula as
inadmissible; and

c) Dismiss the claims over which the Tribunal finds jurisdiction and
which are admissible as unfounded.

And in any event:

d) Order the Claimants to bear, jointly and severally, the
Respondent's costs of the arbitration on a full indemnity basis,
including attorney’s fees and expenses and all fees and other
expenses incurred in participating in the arbitration, including
internal costs.

227. Finally, the Respondent’s request for relief with respect to its Additional Preliminary

Objection, is as follows:
The Respondent respectfully requests that the Tribunal:

a) determine that the Respondent's additional preliminary objection
is timely and complies with Article 41 of the ICSID Arbitration
Rules; and

b) dismiss the Claimants’ claims for lack of jurisdiction under
Article 7 of the Sweden-Romania BIT or, alternatively, as
inadmissible.

Vv. JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

228. In their Memorial, the Claimants presented an affirmative case on jurisdiction. In sum,

they argued:

a. the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione personae:

. The individual Claimants, Messrs. Ioan and Viorel Micula, are “investors”
under Article 1(2) of the BIT, as Swedish citizens who revoked Romanian
citizenship prior to the date of consent and the date of the filing of the
Request for Arbitration (the “RfA”), a proposition confirmed by the Micula
J Award, which is binding and res judicata between Romania and Messrs.

Micula in this arbitration.*°

ii. The corporate Claimants are “investors” under Article 1(2) of the BIT, as
“legal entities” incorporated in Romania which are jointly owned and
controlled by Messrs. Micula, which Romania has agreed to treat as
nationals of another Contracting State for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b)
of the ICSID convention, pursuant to Article 7(3) of the BIT;

5° Cl. Mem., paras. 447-456.

b. the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione materiae under Article 7(2) of the BIT,
because the dispute concerns an investment, defined in Article 1(1) to include “any
kind of asset owned or controlled invested directly or indirectly by an investor [...]
include[ing] ... movable and immovable property[,] ... shares, debentures and
other forms of participation in companies[, and] intellectual property rights,
technical processes, trade names, know-how, good will, and other similar

rights[...].” The Claimants identify:

the shares in the corporate Claimants held by Messrs. Micula, as well as the
investments of those corporate Claimants controlled by Messrs. Micula, as

the investments of those individual Claimants;

ii. the investments made by the corporate Claimants in moveable and
immovable property, and intellectual property rights, as the investments of

the corporate Claimants;*”

c. the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione temporis over the current dispute under Article
9(1), because the BIT entered into force on 1 April 2003 and the dispute concerns
actions and measures from the period after this date, and the dispute itself arose, at

the earliest, on 5 July 2010.°8

229. The Respondent raises a number*? of objections to jurisdiction and/or admissibility:

57 Cl. Mem., paras. 460-462.

°8 Cl. Mem., paras. 463-466.

* In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent initially raised a further objection to jurisdiction — that the Claimants had
failed to establish the Tribunal’s ju ‘ion over their claims, as they have not demonstrated that the Micula Brothers
were shareholders of the EFDG Companies during the relevant period, or that they controlled the EFDG Companies.
See Resp. CM., paras. 324-326. However, the Claimants produced with their Reply “a more complete version of the
excerpts from ‘the Romanian Trade Registry ... confirm[ing] that the Individual Claimants owned the Corporate
Claimants at all relevant time” (Cl. Reply, fn. 1003, and “Excerpts from the Romanian Trade Registry for all Corporate
Claimants,” C-422). Thereafter, that objection was largely abandoned in the Rejoinder. See Resp. Rej., para. 360
(The Claimants produced with their Reply evidence that appears to show that the Micula Brothers held, directly or
a majority of the shares in each of the EFDG Companies, with the exception of S.C. Tonical Trading S.R.L.
Trading”), during the relevant periods. The Respondent therefore does not pursue the argument that the
have failed to establish the Micula Brothers’ shareholding and control of the EFDG Companies, except
with respect to Tonical Trading.” As to Tonical Trading, the Respondent argues that the excerpt from the Romanian
Trade Registry produced by the Claimants shows that “between 2002 and 2011, only approximately 40% of Tonical

a. that Article 267 and 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
(“TFEU”),© as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union (the
“CJEU”) in the case of Slovak Republic v Achmea BV (“Achmea” or the “Achmea
Decision”), preclude the Claimants from consenting to arbitration under Article
8 of the BIT and equally render no longer effective the consent of Romania to
arbitrate disputes under Article 8 (“Additional Preliminary Objection” or
“Achmea/Incompatibility with EU Law Objection”);

b. that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction with regard to the Claimants’ Mineral Water

Claim, because:

i. the dispute regarding the mineral water claim arose before the entry into
force of the Sweden-Romania BIT (“Ratione Temporis Objection to

Mineral Water Claim”);

the mineral water claim does not relate to a dispute between an investor and
Romania; rather the investor’s claim is predicated on the flawed argument
that the National Company of Mineral Water SA (SNAM) is a State entity
(“No Qualifying Dispute Objection to Mineral Water Claim”); and

iii.

that the Micula Brothers have no interest in the claims they are bringing in
this arbitration and that their claims are therefore inadmissible (“Objection

to Admissibility vis-a-vis the Micula Brothers”).

230. The Tribunal addresses these objections below. For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal

notes that, subject to its determinations as to the Respondent’s objections, it otherwise

 

Trading was owned by the Micula Brothers, while approximately 55% was owned by Original Prod SRL and General
‘ilvania Exim SRL, for which no further information is provided” (Resp. Rej., fn. 664). In view of the Tribunal’s
cision on Liability the question whether the documentary evidence establishes control by the Micula Brothers over
Trading in the period between 2002 and 2011 has become moot.

accepts the Claimants’ submissions with regard to its jurisdiction under the ICSID

Convention and the BIT.

THE ACHMEA DECISION/INCOMPATIBILITY WITH EU LAW OBJECTION (ADDITIONAL
PRELIMINARY OBJECTION)

(1) The Parties’ Positions

The Parties’ pleadings are summarized in this section and addressed in more detail as

necessary in the Tribunal’s analysis.

a. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ procedural complaints regarding its Additional

Preliminary Objection, in addition to addressing the merits of the Objection.

7) Timeliness

The Respondent argues that its objection is based on a new fact, and is therefore timely and
justified under ICSID Rule 41(1). In the Respondent’s view, the CJEU indicated its
authoritative and binding opinion on the incompatibility of intra-EU BITs with EU law for
the first time in Achmea. The relevant “fact” is that this incompatibility is no longer a matter
for debate; the institution which has been granted the power definitively to resolve any
such question by the Member States ruled that EU law provisions must prevail over intra-
EU BITs. Although the legal questions posed to the CJEU were known to Romania

previously, the definitive answer to that issue was not previously known.

Relatedly, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ contention that the Achmea Decision
cannot affect the Tribunal’s decision, since it postdates the RFA. This, the Respondent
argues, misses the point: the incompatibility of the BIT with EU law became a fact, at the
latest, when the TFEU took effect on 1 December 2009. Thus, Achmea clarified, with
retroactive effect, that the dispute resolution clauses in intra-EU BITs are incompatible

with EU law.

235.

236.

237.

The Respondent also rejects the argument that, since the questions posed to the CJEU in
Achmea were known to it at the time it filed its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent must
be deemed to have waived this jurisdictional objection when it filed its Counter-Memorial
without making the objection. In the Respondent’s view, its Additional Preliminary
Objection relates to an aspect of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction — valid consent to arbitration —
that cannot be waived or altered by the Parties’ agreement. The Respondent also
emphasises that no procedural inefficiency has arisen as a consequence of the late
jurisdictional objection. Finally, the Respondent rejects as inapposite the cases relied on
by the Claimants in which late jurisdictional objections were not considered by other

tribunals.

In the alternative, the Respondent argues, Achmea and its impact on the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction should be taken into account by the Tribunal proprio motu, in accordance with
ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2). An ICSID tribunal’s primary task, the Respondent
emphasises, is to determine whether there is consent to arbitrate. A tribunal should not
lightly decline to examine this question, when doubts as to the very existence of consent
have emerged. Since the Additional Preliminary Objection is based on a very recent
development which goes to the heart of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the Tribunal must

examine it.

(ii) Merits of the Objection

The Respondent argues that the CJEU in its decision in Achmea held that arbitration clauses
in investment treaties concluded between two EU Member States (‘‘intra-EU BITs”) were
not compatible with Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU, and that consequently, EU law
must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an intra-EU BIT pursuant to which an
investor from a Member State may bring proceedings against another Member State before

an arbitral tribunal.

® Resp. Add. Pre!
7 Resp. Add. Pre!

In the Respondent’s view, Achmea represents an authoritative interpretation of EU law that
is binding on EU Member States (including Romania and Sweden), their courts and their

nationals, including the Claimants:

Although the CJEU did not specify the practical implications of its
ruling for other investment arbitrations brought pursuant to intra
EUBITs, the holding applies erga omnes: the CJEU made clear that
Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU should be interpreted as
precluding a provision “in an international agreement concluded
between Member States”, i.e. in any intra EU BIT with a dispute
resolution clause similar to Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia
BIT.

In addition, decisions of the CJEU have retroactive effect in the sense that, once the CJEU
has ruled on a given issue, its interpretation of EU law has effect from the time that the
provisions of EU law at issue entered into force. The effect of the Achmea Decision is that,
in this case, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the Claimants’ claims under the
Sweden-Romania BIT; in the alternative, those claims are inadmissible.® In support of its
position, the Respondent points to statements by the European Commission regarding the
effect of Achmea, as well as an announcement by the Netherlands that it will terminate all

its intra-EU BITs in light of the decision.

The Respondent acknowledges that the present proceedings are governed by the ICSID
Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and not by the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules, like the Achmea proceedings. However, in its view, this difference does not affect
the applicability of the Achmea Decision here. The State’s consent to arbitrate, and thus
the basis of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, is contained in the BIT; the applicable arbitration
tules have no bearing on the existence of an agreement to arbitrate between the investor

and the host State or on the tribunal’s jurisdiction over claims under the BIT.”°

243.

The Respondent finds support for the aforementioned position in the Claimants’ Jex
societatis (which governs whether the Claimants had the capacity to sue Romania under
the Sweden-Romania BIT) and the TFEU, as interpreted by the CJEU (which governs
whether Romania had validly given consent in Article 7 of the BIT). First, under the
applicable domestic law, the Claimants lost the right to consent to arbitration under Article
7 of the BIT at the latest when the TFEU came into force on 1 December 2009. Thus,
when the Claimants initiated this arbitration and purported to give their own consent to
arbitrate in the RfA, they had no right under EU law — as incorporated into Swedish and
Romanian law — to do so. Hence there is no valid arbitration agreement between the Parties.
Second, Romania’s consent to arbitrate in the BIT also became inapplicable when the
TFEU entered into force, pursuant to Article 30(3) of the VCLT dealing with successive
treaties on the same subject matter. In this regard, Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU relate
to the same subject matter as Article 7 of the earlier BIT and must prevail over the latter.
Thus, Romania’s unilateral consent to arbitrate contained in Article 7 of the Sweden-
Romania BIT was not valid or capable of invocation and acceptance when the Claimants

purported to accept it.”!

b. Claimants’ Position

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s Additional Preliminary Objection both as a matter

of procedure and on the merits.

(i) Timeliness

The Claimants argue that Romania’s objection is barred as untimely by ICSID Arbitration
Rule 41(2). The Claimants note that the Respondent does not dispute that ICSID Rule
41(1) requires that any jurisdictional objection “shall be made as early as possible [...]
[and] no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-
memorial.” They reject the Respondent’s position that its late objection should be admitted

because it falls under the “facts [...] unknown” exception in Rule 41(1) and is exempt from

CL

  

the principle of waiver or, in the alternative, that the Tribunal should exercise its discretion

under Rule 41(2) to consider the objection because it relates to the Parties’ consent.”*

In the Claimants’ view, the additional objection remains inadmissible under Rule 41(1),
because it is not based on an unknown “fact.” The Achmea Decision is not a fact but a
legal decision, and the arguments raised there had been publicly debated for over a decade
previously. In this regard, the Claimants emphasize that the drafting history of the ICSID
Convention makes clear that the drafters understood the difference between “fact” and
“law” and used the two terms with distinction and care. Indeed, the tribunal in Gavrilovié
v Republic of Croatia, confronted with a similar argument, concluded that while “the
handing down of the [Achmea] decision is a fact [...] the decision itself is legal rather than

factual in nature: it clarifies the law in the EU.””

Even if the Achmea Decision were a fact, the Claimants argue, it is irrelevant to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction, because the latter is determined by the facts at the time of the
request for arbitration, not by any new “facf” in 2018. The jurisdiction of international
tribunals is based on the facts as of the time of the request for arbitration, and events taking
place after that date will not affect jurisdiction. Thus, to the extent that the Respondent
argues that the Achmea Decision is a “fact” that occurred in 2018, it cannot affect the

Tribunal’s jurisdiction that was established in 2014.4

In addition, the Claimants contend that the Respondent waived any objection based on the
arguments addressed in the Achmea Decision pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 26(3)
and 27 by failing to raise the objection in its Counter-Memorial, as required under Rule
41(1). In this regard, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that the Objection
relates to an aspect of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction that cannot be waived.” As noted by

Schreuer, “[A] party that has indicated its consent during the proceedings either explicitly

or by pleading on the merits of the case without objecting that consent was lacking,
defective or too narrow is precluded from raising such an objection later on.””° While this
does not apply to the objective criteria in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, namely
the existence of a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment and nationality, “the
tribunal may rely on a party’s failure to invoke the non- existence of its consent as an

indication of its consent.”””

Indeed, the Claimants emphasize, the tribunals in Antaris and
Garilovic both recently rejected, on the basis of a waiver analysis, belated Achmea-based

objections raised in those cases.”*

The Claimants also reject the Respondent’s contention that the Tribunal should exercise its
discretion under Rule 41(2) to consider the objection because it relates to the Parties’

consent. The Tribunal’s “own initiative” under Rule 41(2) is limited to the examination of
the ICSID Convention’s objective jurisdictional requirements and does not extend to
consent. The Claimants argue that other ICSID tribunals have had no difficulty dismissing
untimely jurisdictional objections while refusing to exercise their discretion under Rule
41(2), including in the context of belated Achmea-based objections. In addition, if a
tribunal were to consider any late jurisdictional objection under Arbitration Rule 41(2), the
specific deadline in Rule 41(1), as well as Rules 26 and 27 on time limits and waiver, would

become meaningless.”

(ii) Merits of the Objection

Beyond their procedural objections, the Claimants also contend that the Additional
Preliminary Objection has no basis in substance. In the Claimants’ view, the Respondent
has failed to establish how the Achmea Decision affects the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.

That jurisdiction was established by agreement of the disputing parties in 2014. It is

elemental that the jurisdiction of international tribunals depends upon the facts existing at

the time of of pre dev cannot oust a

tribunal’s jurisdiction. Moreover, the Claimants argue, the law governing jurisdiction here
is international law, notably in the form of the ICSID Convention and the Romania-Sweden
BIT. The CJEU in Achmea did not purport to apply international law. Rather, the decision
was based on principles of EU law autonomous from international law, and it is therefore

of no significance to the analysis that this Tribunal must undertake. *?

Under the governing international law, the Claimants argue, the BIT and the ICSID
Convention are treaties in force for Sweden and Romania. Pacta sunt servanda. Romania
must perform its obligations in good faith under these treaties. The Claimants consider it
“telling” that every tribunal ever to address the “so-called ‘intra-EU objection’” under

international law has rejected it.*!

The Claimants also reject the specific arguments made by Romania in support of its

objection.

First, the Claimants argue, there is no merit in the Respondent’s assertion that the
Claimants lacked the capacity or the right to consent to arbitration under the Sweden-
Romania BIT when they submitted the RfA in October 2014, because “[t]he investor’s
capacity” to consent to arbitration is determined by /ex societatis, i.e., Romanian law and
Swedish law, which in turn, incorporate EU law, including the Achmea Decision. In the
Claimants’ view, this argument is based on an erroneous approach to the notion of legal
capacity. Under the proper analysis, Claimant’s consent to arbitrate is governed by the
ICSID Convention and the BIT, and the Respondent cannot rely on its domestic law to
escape its international obligations. Finally, as a matter of EU law, there is no support for

Romania’s suggestion that the Achmea Decision has a direct effect on private parties.**

Second, the Claimants argue, there is no merit in the Respondent’s assertion that its own

consent “became inapplicable” when the TFEU took effect on 1 December 2009 because

the TFEU takes precedence over Article 7 of the earlier BIT according to Article 30(3) of
the VCLT and the TFEU renders a consent to arbitrate provided in an intra-EU BIT
“inapplicable.” Contrary to the Respondent’s arguments, the Claimants contend that this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction is governed by the ICSID convention and the BIT, and Romania
may not revoke its consent under the ICSID convention. As noted by the International
Court of Justice (“ICJ”) and by Schreuer, it is an accepted principle of international
adjudication that jurisdiction will be determined by reference to the date on which judicial
proceedings are instituted, such that events taking place after that date will not affect
jurisdiction. ICSID tribunals have consistently rejected jurisdictional challenges based on

events taking place after the registration of a claimant’s request for arbitration."

Here, the relevant date for assessing this Tribunal’s jurisdiction is 24 November 2014.
Once jurisdiction is established at that critical date, any subsequent change will not defeat
jurisdiction. The Claimants also emphasize the express provision in Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention that “[w]hen the parties have given their consent, no party may
withdraw its consent unilaterally.” It is clear, the Claimants argue, that the TFEU has not
rendered (and cannot render) the ICSID Convention invalid or “inapplicable” in the present
case. Since Romania’s consent to arbitrate was valid at the time the Claimants initiated
this arbitration, its Additional Preliminary Objection amounts to nothing more than an
attempt unilaterally to withdraw its consent, which conflicts with both the ICSID
Convention and the law of treaties, including the principle of pacta sunt servanda codified
in Article 26 of the VCLT. The law of treaties admits only a limited number of exceptions
to the fundamental obligation to perform treaties in force, none of which applies here. Even
if these prerequisites were met, under the VCLT the BIT would take precedence over the

provisions of EU law addressed in Achmea, which date from 1958.*4

Third, even if EU law were relevant to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the Claimants argue that
neither EU law, nor the CJEU’s judgment in Achmea, would support Romania’s argument
that Article 7 of the Sweden-Romania BIT is “inapplicable” under EU law. In the

Claimants’ view, the fact that a treaty may be deemed incompatible with EU law does not

automatically make that treaty inapplicable. Indeed, even after Achmea, the European
Commission has continued to pursue its infringement proceedings against five EU Member
States. Were the Respondent correct that Achmea automatically rendered these BITs
(including the BIT at issue in this case) “inapplicable,” there would be no reason for the

European Commission to continue these infringement proceedings.*°

Moreover, the CJEU’s judgment in Achmea does not hold that Article 7 of the Sweden-
Romania BIT is invalid or “inapplicable” under EU law. Instead, the CJEU reframed the
question posed to it by the German Supreme Court to avoid addressing the impact of EU
law on the application of an investor-State arbitration provision in any particular case. It is
thus clear that the CJEU did not intend to answer that question, but rather confined the
legal implications of its findings in Achmea to the Member States’ obligations under EU
law. Thus, Achmea cannot be interpreted as invalidating, or otherwise affecting the
“application” of, the dispute resolution clause in the Sweden-Romania BIT under EU

law.*6

Furthermore, even if EU law applied in this arbitration and Achmea had concerned the
validity or “application” of intra-EU BITs, Achmea would still be irrelevant. None of the
sources cited by Romania supports the notion of a general rule stipulating that judgments
of the CJEU have erga omnes effect. But in any event, any erga omnes effect of Achmea
could only extend to the courts of the EU Member States, not to individual subjects of EU
Member States and definitely not to this Arbitral Tribunal.*”

Lastly, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that Achmea would be relevant for
the present case because deciding this case on the merits necessitates the interpretation and
application of EU law. This statement is, in the Claimants’ view, “a gross

misrepresentation” of the case as pleaded by both Parties.**

In conclusion, the Claimants argue, Achmea can only be properly understood as a direction
to EU Member States that they are obliged, under EU law, to terminate or modify existing
intra-EU BITs that include dispute resolution mechanisms such as that in the Netherlands-
Slovakia BIT. The consequence of any failure to do so, however, is not that the BITs are
invalid or “inapplicable,” but merely that any non-compliant EU State may be in breach of

the TFEU — which is irrelevant for this Tribunal’s assessment of its own jurisdiction.”

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis
a. The Timing Issue

The Respondent argues that notwithstanding the fact that its preliminary objection based
on the judgment of the CJEU in Achmea has been brought at a late stage in the proceedings,
the Tribunal should hear the objection. It concerns a new ‘fact’ within the meaning of
ICSID Rule 41(1) and in any event the Tribunal should exercise its discretion to consider
the matter under Rule 41(2).°° The Claimants, by contrast, argue that the Achmea Decision
is not a new fact — the decision is a ruling of law and not a fact. Moreover, the arguments
underlying the Achmea Decision were well known before that decision was reached and
the Respondent could have based a preliminary objection on them earlier.”! It did not do

so, and the Respondent must be taken to have waived any objection on this basis.

The Tribunal considers that the objection made by the Respondent on the basis of the
Achmea Decision falls within the framework of Rule 41(1) justifying late jurisdictional
objections. A late objection may be made, according to Rule 41(1), when “the facts on
which the objection is based” are unknown to the party at the time for making an objection.
While it is true that a judgment is a legal decision and not strictly a fact, it can be, as the
Gavrilovié tribunal pointed out, both a fact and a ruling of law.” If it is only the fact that
there has been a ruling of law and nothing more, then the terms of Rule 41(1) may not have

been met. This appears to have been what influenced the tribunal in the Gavrilovi¢ case.

265.

However, what the Respondent is arguing here is that the Achmea Decision of itself
changes the factual situation that confronts the Tribunal. It means, according to the
Respondent, that the Claimants have no right to bring the claim before this Tribunal and

the Respondent has not consented to arbitration of the claim.

If the consequence claimed by the Respondent were established, it would make the Achmea
Decision not merely another or additional legal ruling. It would take away ab initio the
legal basis on which jurisdiction is determined in this case. Moreover, this would respond
to the Claimants’ argument about waiver.”> The Achmea case, the Respondent claims, is
not simply a reiteration of earlier arguments about intra-EU BITs. Instead, by focusing on
the consent of both the Claimants and the Respondent, it fundamentally changes the basis

on which jurisdiction has to be assessed.

In light of this, the Tribunal concludes that the terms of Rule 41(1) are met, and it is
appropriate for the Tribunal to consider this objection, notwithstanding that it has been
brought late in the proceedings. In these circumstances, there is no need to consider the

relevance of Rule 41(2).

b. The Substance of the Achmea Objection

The essence of the Respondent’s argument is that Achmea decided as a matter of EU law
that the effect of Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU is to preclude a provision in a bilateral
investment treaty between EU member states providing for investor-state dispute
settlement from having any effect. The result is that once the TFEU came into effect on 1
December 2009, the Claimants no longer had a right to consent to arbitration and the
Respondent’s consent to arbitration under a BIT was abrogated.’ Consequently, the

Respondent argues, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear this claim.

The denial of the Claimants’ right to consent to arbitration derives, according to the
Respondent, from the fact that EU law is automatically part of the domestic law of Sweden.

Thus, the effect of Achmea is that under Swedish law, the law of the Claimants’ nationality,

° Resp. Add. Prelim. Obj., para. 80.
°4 Resp. Add. Prelim. Obj., para. 110.

71

the Claimants have no capacity to bring this claim.°° With respect to its own consent under
Article 7 of the Sweden-Romania BIT, the Respondent argues that the TFEU is a treaty
that is later in time than the BIT. Thus, in accordance with Article 30(3) of the VCLT, the
terms of the BIT apply only to the extent that they are compatible with the terms of the
later TFEU.”° The Respondent argues that Achmea establishes that its consent to arbitration
with another EU state under the BIT is incompatible with the TFEU. Since in accordance
with VCLT Article 30(3) the later treaty governs, there is no longer any consent by the

Respondent to arbitration.°”

266. The Claimants counter that the issue of capacity to bring a claim before this Tribunal is
determined by the ICSID Convention and the BIT, not by the domestic law of Sweden.°*
While the issue whether a claimant is a legal entity entitled to pursue a claim is a matter
for the domestic law of Sweden (such as whether the claimant is a minor or whether it is
an incorporated entity), the issue whether it can bring a claim under the Convention and
the BIT has to be determined by those instruments themselves, not by the domestic law of

Sweden incorporating provisions of EU law.

267. The Tribunal will deal first with the question of the consent of the Claimants to arbitration

(Section V(A)(2)(c)) and second with the consent of the Respondent (Section V(A)(2)(d)).

c. Consent of the Claimants

268. The argument that the effect of Achmea as a matter of Swedish domestic law is to deny the
Claimants the right to bring this claim is based on the premise that capacity for the purposes
of this Tribunal is determined by reference to the domestic law of Sweden. However, the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal is based on the ICSID Convention and the Sweden-Romania
BIT.” Article 25 of the ICSID Convention defines the jurisdiction of the Centre, and hence

of this Tribunal, in terms of consent and nationality. There is no dispute as to the nationality

® See Z. Douglas, The International Law of Investment Claims (Cambridge, 2009), p. 74, Rule 6, CL-188: “The law

ICSID Convention.”

271.

of the Claimants and the Claimants have notified their consent in the form contemplated
by the Convention. There is nothing in Article 25 that subjects the ability to grant consent

to the domestic law of the state of nationality of claimants.

Of course, there are matters under Article 25 for which the domestic law of a claimant’s
state is relevant; that law determines whether a claimant is in fact a national of that state or
is a juridical person. But once these requirements are met, there is no basis for looking at
the law of the claimant state in search of some other barrier to exercising jurisdiction.
Moreover, if a party to the Convention were to change its domestic law in a way that denied
access to ICSID dispute settlement, then the question might arise whether that party was in
breach of its obligations under the Convention. But even in such an event, the domestic
law of the party would not be the basis for the determination of jurisdiction by the Tribunal,

which would still be governed by Article 25 of the Convention.

The Sweden-Romania BIT, which provides the basis for investor-state arbitration under
the ICSID Convention in this case, deals with jurisdiction in terms of investors and
investments, both of which are defined in Article 1 of the Treaty. An investor is defined in
terms of citizenship of one of the parties or in terms of legal entities formed in accordance
with the law of a contracting party that have their seats in the territory of that contracting
party. There is no dispute over these matters in this case. As in the case of the ICSID
Convention, there is nothing in the BIT that provides for any further jurisdictional
stipulation by reference to the domestic law of one of the contracting parties. Equally, as
in the case of the ICSID Convention, if one party were to change its domestic law so as to
deny access to the dispute settlement process set out in the BIT, that may constitute a breach
of obligations under the BIT, but it does not affect the jurisdiction of a tribunal established
in accordance with the BIT, which must apply the terms of the BIT and not the domestic

law of one of the parties.

As a result, the Tribunal cannot see how its jurisdiction over the Claimants under the BIT
and the ICSID Convention can be changed as a result of a change in the domestic law of
Sweden, the state of nationality of the Claimants. An amendment to either the BIT or the

ICSID Convention (or both) would be required to change the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

73

272.

273.

274.

But that has not been done in this case and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal depends on
whether the terms of the ICSID Convention and of the BIT have been complied with. In
respect of the right of the Claimants to bring this claim there is no issue of non-compliance
with the terms of the ICSID Convention or the BIT. The jurisdictional challenge in respect

of the consent of the Claimants is based solely on a change in Swedish domestic law.

Thus, even if it were correct that the effect of the Achmea Decision is to change the

10 that would not be

domestic law of Sweden, a position that the Claimants challenge,
sufficient. There would have to be a change in the ICSID Convention or the BIT to have

the effect for which the Respondent contends.

d. Consent of Romania

The Respondent argues that once the TFEU came into force, its own consent to arbitration
under the BIT was terminated. It reaches this conclusion on the basis of VCLT Article
30(3), which sets out the conditions under which a later treaty takes the place of an earlier

treaty.
The relevant provisions of Article 30 of the VCLT are as follows:
Article 30(1)

Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights
and obligations of States parties to successive treaties relating to
the same subject-matter shall be determined in accordance with the
following paragraphs.

Article 30(3)

When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later
treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in
operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the
extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later
treaty.

74

275.

276.

277.

278.

279.

The Respondent concludes that since Article 7 of the BIT dealing with dispute settlement
is incompatible with Article 267 and 344 of the TFEU, Article 7 is inapplicable, so
Romania can no longer be taken to have consented to ICSID arbitration. The Claimants
argue that the terms of Article 30(3) have not been met, because the BIT and the TFEU are
not “treaties relating to the same subject matter” within the meaning of VCLT Article 30(1)

and the relevant provisions are not incompatible.

The Respondent’s argument is on two fronts. It argues, first, that there is a general conflict
between the BIT and the TFEU, because it was the intention of the negotiators of the TFEU
to bring foreign investment within the framework of the TFEU, and, second, that there is a
specific conflict between Article 7 of the BIT, which provides for investor-state dispute
settlement, and Articles 267 and 344, which gave jurisdiction in matters of the

interpretation of the EU Treaties to the CJEU.

With respect to the general conflict between the BIT and the TFEU, the Tribunal observes
that the interpretation of international agreements is not based on a general reference to the
intention of the parties. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties deals with intention
through the interpretive rule of Article 31. In other words, the outcome of the interpretive
process will determine the intention of the parties. Thus, whether there is incompatibility
between the BIT and the TFEU has to be determined through the interpretation of the
specific provisions involved. The fact that both treaties deal with investment does not

answer the question whether one is incompatible with the other.

In the view of the Tribunal, the starting point for determining whether there is
incompatibility between the BIT and the TFEU within the meaning of VCLT Article 30(3)
is the question whether the two treaties are “successive treaties relating to the same subject
matter.” At a certain level of generality, they do relate to the same subject matter, but the

question is whether that level is specific enough to meet the requirements of Article 30(3).

The Respondent argues that the two treaties deal with the same subject matter “because

Article 7 of the Sweden-Romania BIT deals with the resolution of disputes that may

75

280.

281.

282.

involve the application of the EU Treaties.”'°' The fact that BIT arbitration may involve
the interpretation of EU law was the CJEU’s objection to investor-state arbitration in
Achmea. But Achmea was not concerned with whether BITs and the TFEU were treaties
dealing with the same subject matter within the meaning of VCLT Article 30 or with
interpretation under the VCLT at all. Rather, it was because the CJEU considered that a
tribunal established under a BIT might have to interpret EU law that it found an
inconsistency with TFEU Articles 267 and 344 giving it exclusive jurisdiction over the
interpretation of EU law. To allow BIT tribunals to interpret the EU treaties would, in the
view of the CJEU, contravene the principles of “mutual trust” and “sincere cooperation”
as well as “the preservation of the particular nature of the law established by the

5 ag 77102
Treaties.” !

While these concerns are understandable in considering the integrity of European Union
law, they do not constitute criteria for determining whether two treaties relate to the same
subject matter in the application of the principles set out in VCLT Article 30. Interpretation
in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT requires that the terms of both treaties be looked

at closely.

Article 7 of the BIT empowers the investors of one party to sue the other party and sets out
alternative processes for such claims, which in the present case is arbitration under the
ICSID Convention. The TFEU does not provide a specific process for investors in one EU
state to sue another EU state. Instead, the articles that are invoked as dealing with the same
subject matter deal with the jurisdiction of the CJEU to give preliminary rulings in the
interpretation of the EU treaties (Article 267) and the exclusive jurisdiction of the CJEU to
interpret the Treaties (Article 344).

If the BIT had set up a tribunal to interpret and apply EU law, then the treaties would be
dealing with the same subject matter and incompatibility would be established. Article 344
gives the CJEU exclusive authority to interpret the EU Treaties and if an investment

tribunal were given authority to resolve disputes under EU law then the TFEU (and,

‘01 Resp, Add. Prelim. Obj., para. 118.

284.

285.

specifically, Article 344) and BIT Article 7 would not be compatible. However, tribunals
are established under BITs to resolve disputes over the interpretation and application of the
obligations set out in the BIT in question. They are not established to resolve disputes

under EU law.

Of course, such a tribunal may well have to have regard to EU law, but this will be
incidental and will not be a question going to the core issues of the dispute. The CJIEU
recognized the contingent nature of investment tribunals referring to EU law when it said
that a claim under a BIT “may” relate to the interpretation of the EU agreement or EU law.
The Respondent has argued that EU law is in fact implicated in this case, referring to EU
Directives relating to excise tax concerning alcohol producers. However, these provisions
are invoked by the Claimants to establish the background to the measures that they claim
violate Romania’s obligations under the BIT. They are not invoked in order to have the

Tribunal make determinations of EU law.

In late submissions to the Tribunal, the Respondent provided additional documents relating
to its argument on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in respect of an intra-EU state claim.
They included Declarations by a number of EU member states on the “Legal consequences
of the judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on investment protection in the
European Union” of 15 January 2019 and on “The Enforcement of the judgment of the
Court of Justice in Achmea and on investment protection in the European Union” of 16
January 2019. The Declarations are similar in that they reiterate the finding in Achmea that
Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU preclude investor-state arbitration and they draw
consequences for member states which have to undertake certain actions. In particular,
member states undertake to inform pending investment tribunals of the legal consequences
of the Achmea Decision as set out in the declaration, which is what the Respondent has

done here.

The Respondent argued that these Declarations constituted binding subsequent agreements
between the parties to the BIT; the Claimants contested this and argued that they were no
more than political declarations. The Tribunal does not see any need to choose between

these conflicting positions. The Declarations do no more than reiterate what was concluded

77

286.

287.

288.

in the Achmea Decision. If the Achmea Decision itself did not remove jurisdiction from
this Tribunal, repeating what the decision says, whether by agreement or otherwise, can

have no greater effect than the decision itself.

In the view of the Tribunal these declarations do not affect the Tribunal’s analysis. They
indicate the state of the law within the European Union and the obligations of EU member
states in light of Achmea. They are interpretations of EU law and they do not provide
insight into the issues here — whether capacity to bring a claim under a BIT is regulated by
the BIT and the ICSID Convention or whether it is regulated by the domestic law of a
claimant’s state of nationality, and whether as a matter of international law the TFEU is a
subsequent treaty relating to the same subject matter as the BIT. Indeed, the CJEU in

Achmea did not purport to deal with any of these issues.

The Respondent further introduced into the record almost at the end of the hearing two
diplomatic notes, one from Romania to Sweden dated 18 January 2019 and the other from
Sweden to Romania dated 31 January 2019. In the former note, the Government of
Romania requested the support of the Government of Sweden to inform this Tribunal, in
accordance with the terms of the declarations of the EU states, of the legal consequences
of the Achmea Decision. In its response the Government of Sweden affirmed its
commitment to the declarations and to its obligation to inform investment tribunals of the

legal consequences of Achmea and stated:

Therefore, according to the case law of the CJEU, the provisions of
a bilateral agreement between Member states of the EU containing
an investor-state arbitration clause such as the one described in the
Achmea judgment is contrary to Union law and thus inapplicable.

The Respondent contends that this exchange of notes can constitute an agreement, !°? but
as with the Declarations, the exchange of notes cannot have the consequences contended

for. They constitute, as articulated in the Swedish note, the state of “the case law of the

CJEU.” That is precisely what was referred to above where the conclusion was reached

163 Tr, Day 9, 110:15-20.

78

that the case law of the CJEU, the Achmea Decision, cannot remove the jurisdiction of this

Tribunal.

289. In light of the above, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction based
on the CJEU’s ruling in Achmea.

B. THE PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS TO THE MINERAL WATER CLAIM
() The Parties’ Positions
a. Respondent’s Position

290. With regard to the Claimants’ Mineral Water Claim, the Respondent contends that
European Drinks challenged the invoice issued by SNAM on the basis of the new price set
by the Competition Council on 25 February 2002, and that this is the date upon which the
dispute arose. However, the BIT was signed on 29 May 2002 and entered into force on |
April 2003. The Respondent says that since Article 9(1) of the BIT expressly excludes the
application of the BIT to disputes regarding investments that arose prior to the BIT’s entry
into force, the Mineral Water Claim is outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione
temporis.'°* The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ argument that their claim relating to
price increases occurring after 2008 is not excluded by the Respondent’s temporal
objection. In the Respondent’s view, this misstates what the dispute involves — the
application of the amended pricing regime through legislation GEO 178/2001. It is
undisputed that the enactment of the new pricing regime occurred before the entry into

force of the Sweden-Romania BIT. '°5

291. In addition, the Respondent contends that the Mineral Water Claim does not relate to a

dispute between an investor and Romania. Therefore, neither the requirements of Article

104 Resp. CM., paras. 327-331. The Respondent initially argued that Claimants have failed to demonstrate that
European Drinks mineral water business qualifies as an investment within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the BIT and
Article 25 of the Convention, and that the'l Mineral Water Claim therefore stands to be dismissed on this basis
It further contended that the Claimants have failed to establish how the Mineral Water Contract is an obligation entered
into with them with regard to a qualifying investment. See Resp. CM., para. 327. The Claimants flatly rejected these
contentions in their Reply, reserving the right to revert further if the Respondent sought to pursue this init
Rejoinder. See Cl. Reply, paras. 676-682. The Respondent did not pursue these arguments in its Rejoinder. In any
event, given the Tribunal’s findings as to the Respondent’s ratione temporis objection to the Mineral Water Claim,
the Tribunal need not consider this.

25 of the ICSID Convention, nor of Article 7 of the BIT have been satisfied and the
Tribunal has no jurisdiction. The Respondent emphasizes that European Drinks’ Mineral
Water Contract was entered into with SNAM — a State-owned joint-stock company
operating under private law, with no authority to exercise governmental authority or other
public prerogatives — and that the Claimants do not invoke any obligation undertaken by
Romania itself with respect to this contract. The Respondent argues that an umbrella clause
does not create new legal obligations; it merely transforms already existing legal
obligations into treaty obligations. In other words, a claimant and the State must both be a
party to the underlying contract for the umbrella clause to have any operation.'°° In this
regard, the Respondent rejects Claimants’ reliance on the rules of attribution in attempting
to support their contention that “SNAM is Romania.” In the Respondent’s view, the rules
of attribution concern alleged breaches of international obligations of States and not the
existence of those international obligations. In any case, even if the rules of attribution were
relevant, SNAM is not, contrary to the Claimants’ contentions, empowered to exercise

governmental authority, but rather is mandated to undertake commercial activities only.'°7

b. Claimants’ Position

The Claimants argue that while the first unilateral price revision under the Mineral Water
Contract took place before the entry into force of the BIT, Romania’s ratione temporis
objection can have no application with respect to the five unilateral price changes imposed
by Romania after the entry into force of the BIT. In the Claimants’ view, disputes relating
to all subsequent price increases necessarily arose after the enactment of those price
increases and after the entry into force of the BIT.!°° The Claimants withdrew their claims
relating to price increases before the contracting parties agreed to an amendment of the
Contract in 2007. The claim for damages thus begins with the price increase in 2008,

“put[ting] a rest to Romania’s temporal objection.”!”

'© Cl, Reply, para. 686-688.

80

293. In addition, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that it cannot be held liable
for a breach of the umbrella clause, because it is not a party to the underlying Mineral
Water Contract. First, the Mineral Water Contract was initially entered into by RAMIN
(the Autonomous Administration of Mineral Waters of Romania), which is Romania;
Romania then decided to assign RAMIN’s rights to SNAM. Second, on Claimants’ case,
SNAM is Romania: SNAM is wholly owned by the Romanian State, with the Ministry of
Industry and Commerce exercising the rights and obligations related to SNAM’s shares.
SNAM exercises elements of governmental authority concerning the management of State-
owned mineral water resources, including with respect to the Mineral Water Contract. And
SNAM’s conduct at issue in this arbitration results from the exercise of this governmental
authority in relation to mineral water resources subject to the Mineral Water Contract, by
amending the existing legal regime and introducing price revisions by Romania’s
Competition Office and MPF, for non-contractual public policy reasons. Finally, the
Claimants invoke the text, object and purpose of the BIT’s umbrella clause in support of

its arguments. |!°

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

294. The Respondent argues that the claim that it had violated Article 2(4) of the BIT by
unilaterally changing the price under the Mineral Water Contract was not a matter that fell
under the Sweden-Romania BIT.!!! Article 9(1) of the BIT provides that the Agreement
does not apply “to any dispute concerning an investment which arose, or any claim

concerning an investment which was settled, before its entry into force.”

295. The alleged breach, the Respondent argues, took place no later than 25 February 2002, but
the BIT did not enter into force until 1 April 2003. According to the Respondent, the claim
thus does not fall within the Sweden-Romania BIT and therefore is outside the jurisdiction

of the Tribunal.

The Claimants argue that although the first unilateral price change took place before the
BIT came into force, the subsequent five price changes occurred after the BIT came into
force. It limits its claim to the invoices issued after 2008, thus contending that the Tribunal

has jurisdiction over this dispute. |!

However, the Respondent points out that the price changes were made pursuant to GEO
178/2001, legislation that set up a pricing regime under which invoices were sent. Thus,
the objections to invoices with the revised pricing amounts were objections to the right

asserted in GEO 178/2001, which preceded the entry into force of the BIT.

The Tribunal has concluded that it does not have jurisdiction over the Mineral Water
Contract dispute. The legislative authority provided on 25 December 2001 for the unilateral
determination of prices was implemented with an increase in prices on 25 February 2002.
At that point, the question arose whether this unilateral setting of prices constituted a breach
of the stipulation in the agreement between European Drinks and SNAM that price changes
would be agreed between the parties. Thus, that is when any breach of contract relating to
prices under the Mineral Water Contract arose and any violation of Article 2(4) of the

Sweden-Romania BIT would have occurred.

Subsequent invoices based on the same 2001 legislative authority might well have
increased the loss attributable to a breach, but they were not new disputes. Each invoice
was a manifestation of the action of the Respondent in assuming the power to set prices
unilaterally, which it had done in 2001 and 2002, more than a year before the Sweden-
Romania BIT came into force. In the terms of Article 9(1) of the BIT, the dispute arose

before the entry into force of the BIT.
Accordingly, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction in respect of the Mineral Water Claim.

In light of this decision, the Tribunal sees no need to consider the other preliminary

objections relating to the Mineral Water Claim.

THE OBJECTION TO ADMISSIBILITY VIS-A-VIS THE MICULA BROTHERS
(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent contends that the claims in this arbitration relate to the injury allegedly
incurred by the Corporate Claimants. As shareholders, the Micula Brothers have no
automatic right to, or legal interest in, the Corporate Claimants’ profits, and hence they do
not have any interest in the claims they are bringing in this arbitration, which are therefore
inadmissible.!'> In this regard the Respondent argues that the principle of separate legal
personality applicable in domestic law cannot be ignored under international law, and
therefore a bilateral investment treaty cannot have the effect of granting shareholders
substantive rights with respect to a limited company, or conferring on them a substantive

legal interest, which they do not have under municipal law.!!4

The Respondent emphasises that the admissibility of a shareholder’s claim is a different
question to whether the shareholder qualifies as an investor. Here, just as in BG v
Argentina, the Micula Brothers, as shareholders, are seeking to recover alleged lost profits
of the Corporate Claimants to which they have no right, and in which they have no legal
interest. While shareholders may be entitled to dividends, that entitlement only arises if a
company declares a dividend, which it may choose not to do, and may in fact be precluded
from doing by law or by agreements with creditors. Shareholders can bring separate claims
for reflective loss (i.e., claims for the diminution in value of their shareholdings, or for lost
dividends, as a result of the impact of the alleged breaches on the companies in which they

own shares). But the Micula Brothers have not done so here. !!>

b. Claimants’ Position

The Claimants do not directly address the Respondent’s objection in the terms of

admissibility articulated by the Respondent. However, they do address the Respondent’s

347-351, referring to BG Group v Argentina, UNCITRAL, Final Award (24 December 2007),
para. 383.

83

related contention that any damages should be awarded to the Corporate Claimants only,
because Messrs. Ioan and Viorel Micula have not proved their losses and shareholders can
be compensated only for injury sustained either through lost dividends or a decrease in the
value of their shareholdings. To that, the Claimants argue that the Micula J tribunal has
already decided that an arbitral tribunal has the power to allocate damages according to the
Claimants’ agreement regarding the allocation of damages between them, and that this
finding is res judicata between the Parties to this arbitration. They also emphasize that the
BIT here (in Article 2(2)) provides for the protection of indirect investments, and that there
are prior awards in which tribunals have awarded damages directly to the controlling

shareholders.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

305. In view of its decision on Liability below, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to
make a determination on this issue.

VI. LIABILITY

306. The Claimants claim that Romania’s conduct breaches the BIT in four respects. They allege
that Romania has:

a. breached the obligation of fair and equitable treatment, by “trampl[ing]” on
Claimants’ legitimate expectations that Romania would enforce its laws and
prevent illegal production in the liquor market, and by failing to provide a stable
legal environment and to enforce its laws against participants in the black market
(Section VI(A));

b. breached the BIT’s prohibition of impairment of investments through unreasonable
or discriminatory measures, through the same failings (Section VI(B));

c. failed to accord full legal protection to Claimants’ investments as required under

the BIT, also through the same failings (Section VI(C)); and

d. failed to observe the obligations it undertook as regards Claimants’ investments in
the mineral water business, giving rise to a breach of the umbrella clause in the

BIT.

The Tribunal addresses each claim in turn in the sections below.

FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT.
(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. Claimants’ Position

The Claimants contend that Romania has breached its obligation under Article 2(3) of the
BIT to treat Claimants’ investments fairly and equitably, by “failing to enforce its tax laws

in a consistent manner and fostering the growth of a substantial illegal spirits market.”!'7

(i) The Applicable Standard

With respect to the specific standard applicable under the BIT, the Claimants refer to the
decision in Micula v Romania 1,''® which was decided on the basis of the same Sweden-
Romania BIT at issue in the present case. In that case, the Claimants argue, Romania
agreed that the FET standard “should be interpreted in the light of the object and purpose
of the BIT as reflected in its Preamble” and it did not contest that the FET standard is “an
autonomous one, different from the international minimum standard.”!'? In the Claimants’
view, Micula v Romania J is res judicata and additionally binding on the Parties pursuant
to Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention, and the Respondent may not relitigate any

question linked to the meaning of the BIT provisions decided by the Micula v Romania I

tribunal. The Claimants cite to, inter alia, the Apotex Holdings v USA Award in support

of this position. !7°

In the Claimants’ argument, the FET standard is broad and fact-specific. In applying it,
tribunals have considerable discretion to review the “fairness” and “equity” of government
actions in light of the facts and circumstances of the case.'?! Claimants rely on the

following summary of the FET standard articulated by the LG&E tribunal:

[...] the fair and equitable standard consists of the host State’s
consistent and transparent behaviour, free of ambiguity that
involves the obligation to grant and maintain a stable and
predictable legal framework necessary to fulfill the justified
expectations of the foreign investor.

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s reliance on Waste Management II in this context.
In addition to being in conflict with the findings of the Micula I tribunal, Waste
Management II “contains a summary of measures that may amount to a breach of the
minimum standard of treatment, not the definition of the standard.” It also dealt with
alleged breaches of NAFTA (as did the other cases applying it) and is therefore not
applicable to the FET standard under the BIT here.!7°

The Claimants assert that breaches of the FET standard may be by act or by omission, and
need not be egregious.'*4 The Claimants reject the Respondent’s submission that an
omission can give rise to an FET breach only in “exceptional circumstances” — in the

Claimants’ view, there is no support for this contention, which is in conflict with

incontrovertible principles of international law and with prior awards imposing no caveats

on the application of this principle. !75

The Claimants argue that previous tribunals have held that the FET standard imposed by

FET provisions similar to Article 2(3) includes four elements. 126

First, the FET standard encompasses a duty to protect the legitimate expectations of the
investor. This, the Claimants argue, is the “dominant element” of fair and equitable
treatment. Expectations may be based on explicit or implicit undertakings or
representations by a host State, as well as by the nature of the legal framework and the
general business environment existing at the time of the investment. Specific
representations are not required, contrary to the Respondent’s assertions. Legitimate
expectations may also be based on more basic and general expectations including as to the
continuous existence of conditions that enable an investor to operate its business. With
regard to expectations based on the legal framework, the Claimants argue that this extends
to the basic premise that legislation will be consistently applied and that the host State will
“implement, monitor and enforce” its own laws. That, the Claimants say, has been
confirmed by other tribunals, including the tribunals in GAMI Investments v Mexico (a host
State must “accept liability if its officials fail to implement or implement regulations in a
discriminatory or arbitrary fashion”), M7D v Chile (a host State “has an obligation to act
coherently and apply its policies consistently”), Lemire v Ukraine (“‘a blatant disregard of
applicable [...] rules, distorting fair competition” can amount to a violation of the FET
standard), and Tecmed v Mexico.'"’ The Claimants reject the Respondent’s suggestion,
made in reliance on GAMI, that arbitral tribunals impose a high bar to qualify a State’s

failure to enforce its laws as a breach of the FET standard; in the Claimants’ view, the

Respondent’s reading of GAMI is erroneous, and its other attempts to minimize the

importance of the relevant jurisprudence is unavailing. '*

315. Second, the FET standard encompasses a duty to provide a stable, predictable and
consistent legal framework and business environment. In this regard, the Claimants point
to, inter alia, the decision of the tribunal in CMS v Argentina, holding that “a stable legal
and business environment is an essential element of fair and equitable treatment” and “fair

and equitable treatment is inseparable from stability and predictability.”!°

316. Third, the FET standard encompasses an obligation to act in good faith. Previous tribunals
have found that good faith is inherent in the FET standard, that the obligation to act in good
faith encompasses an obligation not purposefully to inflict damage upon an investment,
and that the use, by the host states, of legal instruments for purposes other than their
intended use constitutes a bad faith action. The Claimants emphasise that while bad faith
is not required to find an FET breach, “a finding of bad faith is in and of itself sufficient”
for finding an FET breach.'*°

317. Fourth, the FET standard encompasses a duty not to act arbitrarily or unreasonably, or to
discriminate against the foreign investor. In this regard, the Claimants note (relying on the
awards in CMS v Argentina and Micula v Romania J) that any measure “that might involve
arbitrariness or discrimination” or “conduct that is substantively improper, whether
because it is arbitrary, manifestly unreasonable, discriminatory or in bad faith” will violate

the FET standard. '*!

318. The Respondent, the Claimants contend, has violated all four elements of the FET standard,
in that it has failed to (i) protect Claimants’ legitimate expectations, (ii) provide a stable

and consistent legal framework and business environment, (iii) act in good faith, and (iv)

abstain from acting arbitrarily, unreasonably and discriminatorily. Their arguments in

respect of each of these elements are set forth below.

(ii) Failure to Protect Claimants’ Legitimate Expectations

The Claimants characterise as their “initial investment period” the period 1994-1998, when
they obtained financing to construct a spirits distillery and created a spirits brand,
distribution network, bottling capacity and can-filling lines. At that time, the Claimants
contend, the business environment in the spirits industry was characterized by the existence
of a “large legal [spirits production and sales] market and a level playing field.” It was not
possible for an operator to sell spirits at prices much lower than those offered by efficient
business operators, even if it evaded taxation. As a result, competition in the form of black

market activities had no material impact on legal spirits producers. '*?

In this “initial investment period,” the legal framework made the sale of untaxed spirits
illegal and the Romanian authorities “had the mandate to identify and stop untaxed spirits
sales.” Moreover, new legislation was introduced aimed at safeguarding the rights of legal

alcohol operators and facilitating fiscal control of the spirits market. !*

The Claimants assert that they made their initial investments in reliance on the legitimate
expectation that Romania would enforce its own laws and would not allow a massive influx
of illegal competition from operators able to offer extremely low prices as a result of
Romania allowing them to evade their tax obligations. The Claimants also assert that they
had a legitimate expectation that they would be able to make use of the distillery’s cost-
efficiency to compete on pricing against other operators in the market. The Claimants
would never, they contend, have invested as they did, but for these legitimate expectations
on their part.!*4 The Respondent’s argument that there is no evidence of reliance by the
Claimants on the existing market structure is, the Claimants say, unfounded, and ignores

Claimants’ witness evidence and expert evidence regarding the evolution of the market.'*°

is. 548-553.

89

322.

323.

In the period that followed, from 1998 and into the early 2000s, the Claimants assert that
their legitimate expectations were reinforced. In particular, once Romania realised that
black market activities had increased following an increase in the applicable taxes, it
implemented measures to reverse the negative development, reinforcing the expectation
that Romania would continue to enforce its tax legislation equally against all market
players and to take action to protect legal operators against black market competition.
Similarly, the introduction of additional regulatory mechanisms in the period 1998-2002,
described above,'*° gave rise to the Claimants’ continued legitimate expectation that
Romania would monitor the spirits industry and ensure compliance with tax laws, and that

regulatory control over the spirits industry would increase.'57

Last, contemporaneous
statements by Romania, including those made within the framework of Romania’s
accession negotiations with the EU, “confirm[ed] the legitimacy and reasonableness of

Claimants’ expectations that Romania would enforce its own tax laws.”!8

However, the Claimants argue, Romania frustrated these legitimate expectations and
thereby breached the FET standard, through its rapid tax increases, coupled with its failure
to collect taxes from most spirits producers and its failure to prevent substantial production
of untaxed illegal spirits, resulting in a substantial decrease of the taxed, legal spirits
market.'3? Romania’s contention that it made “reasonable and cost-efficient efforts” to
fight tax evasion, exceeding the minimum applicable threshold, is unfounded; the
Claimants take issue with the inspection evidence relied on by the Respondent, arguing
that it principally relates to inspections of legal registered producers (and not illegal black
market producers). The Claimants highlight the evidence — including expert evidence — in

support of their contentions with their Reply.'°

In their Reply, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s contention that Romania’s level of
development is critical to assessing whether or not a State’s failure to implement its laws
amounts to an FET breach. In the Claimants’ view, this cannot be reconciled with the fact
that the FET standard is an absolute standard. Moreover, Article 2(3) of the BIT does not
support the view that the host State’s level of development should be relevant to determine
whether or not a breach of FET has occurred. Nor does the case law support this

contention. '4!

The Claimants point to, inter alia, the holding of the tribunal in Arif v
Moldova that the fact that a state is not yet comparable to long-established democracies
and market economies does “not lower the standard of investment protection provided by
a BIT or excuse breaches of that standard.”'*? The Claimants also assert that the
Respondent has failed to show that its level of development is such that could excuse it

from enforcing its laws.'*7

(iii) Failure to provide a stable and consistent legal framework and business
environment
The Claimants rely on the same facts as just described in support of their contention that
Romania breached the FET standard by failing to provide a stable and consistent legal
framework and business environment for the Claimants’ investments. In this regard, they
argue that the Respondent’s failure to prevent the expansion of the spirits black market,
through the introduction of very significant tax increases while completely disregarding its
obligation to enforce taxes against all market players amounted to a failure to prevent —

indeed, it allowed the emergence of — a completely deteriorated business environment. !#4

The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s position that there could be no expectation that
Romania would not change its laws absent a stabilisation clause “misses the point,” noting

that the Claimants’ claims are based on Romania’s failure to implement its laws. For the

Claimants, the Respondent’s argument that it was the acts of third parties — for which the
Respondent is not liable — which led to the proliferation of the black market is also baseless.
The development of the black market was directly linked to Romania’s inaction in
enforcing its laws, and as argued elsewhere, there is no evidence that Romania made

significant efforts to fight the black market in the spirits sector. '*°

(iv) Failure to act in good faith

327. The Respondent, the Claimants argue, was “fully aware” that the sharp increases in excise
duties, without adequate and complementary enforcement measures, would lead to the
expansion of a spirits black market and inflict damage upon the businesses of legal
operators such as the Claimants. They point in this regard to warnings made by the
European Union and the European Institute of Romania, as well as to Romania’s own

internal documentation. '“°

328. However, the Claimants argue, the Respondent knowingly disregarded these warnings and
expressions of concern by proceeding as it did. Moreover, it was “repeatedly advised” of
the devastation its acts and omissions were inflicting on legal producers, yet it declined to
adopt any effective measures to address the problem. In this manner, the Claimants argue,
the Respondent breached it obligation to act in good faith. In doing so, the Respondent
may have been motivated by political concerns — the failure to enforce its laws cannot be

attributed to a lack of financial or administrative means. '47

329. The Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that their good faith claim is duplicative.
The Claimants’ claim based on the Respondent acting in a discriminatory or arbitrary

manner is based on acts and omissions, whereas the claim for failure to act in good faith is

based on Respondent’s state of mind.'4* In addition, the Claimants reject what they

 

characterize as the Respondent’s suggestion that the requi: of the EU di

Romania’s accession justify the development of the black market. Romania was aware
that it would have to take appropriate enforcement measures when adopting new laws in
accordance with EU requirements.'? Finally, the Claimants reject Romania’s defenses
based on traditional activities of the population, arguing that there is no legal authority to

support them.!*°

(v) Failure to abstain from acting arbitrarily, unreasonably and discriminatorily

 

330. Finally, the Claimants reference their allegations, summarized in Section B(1)a) below, in
support of their argument that the Respondent also breached the FET standard by failing
to abstain from acting arbitrarily, unreasonably and discriminatorily.'*!

b. Respondent’s Position

331. The Respondent rejects the Claimants arguments, asserting that it has, in fact, ensured that

the Claimants’ investments received fair and equitable treatment.
(i) The Applicable Standard

332. The Respondent agrees that the discussion concerning the legal standard for FET in the
Micula I Award is instructive. In the Respondent’s view, the “main thrust” of the legal
standard of fair and equitable treatment as articulated in Micula J was to emphasise that a
balanced approach to the interests of a foreign investor and the general right of States to
regulate in the public interest must be taken.'** However, the Respondent rejects the
Claimants’ suggestion that the LG&E tribunal set down any “universally applicable
‘summary’” of the standard. Rather, the applicable summary is found in Waste
Management I, expressly approved by the Micula I Award. It provides:

[T]he minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable
treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and
harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair,
unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant
to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process
leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety — as might
be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial
proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an
administrative process. In applying this standard it is relevant that
the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State
which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.'**

The Respondent also argues that the Claimants’ assertion that the FET standard may be
breached by omission is unsupported by the case on which the Claimants rely, Suez v
Argentina. In Suez, the Respondent contends, the action upon which the Claimants rely as
an ostensible omission was, in fact, not an omission. In the Respondent’s view, “[o]nly in
exceptional circumstances can an omission amount to a breach of the obligation to provide

FET."154

With respect to the specific elements identified by the Claimants, the Respondent had the

following observations.

First, although the Respondent agrees that legitimate expectations are an important factor
in the FET standard, it argues that the Claimants’ notion of legitimate expectations is too
broad and unrealistic and fails to protect States’ legitimate right to regulate. In particular,
the cases relied on by the Claimants do not support the proposition that the FET standard
protects “basic and general expectations” including the “continuous existence of conditions
that enable an investor to operate its business.” It says that that notion has in fact been
rejected by many previous tribunals; specific promises or undertakings are required.!°> The
Respondent points inter alia to PSEG v Turkey (“[l]egitimate expectations by definition

require a promise of the administration on which the Claimants rely to assert a right that

needs to be observed”), and EDF v Romania (requiring “specific promises or
representations”) in support of its position. !>¢ It also emphasises the importance of a State’s
ability to change existing legislation and adopt new laws, in reliance on AES v Hungary.'57
In response to the Claimants’ contention that “an investor is entitled to rely on the basic
premise that the host State will implement, monitor and enforce its own laws,” the
Respondent argues that the Claimants’ main legal support for their argument, GAMI v
Mexico, sets a very high standard for such a finding, requiring that there must be “an
‘outright and unjustified repudiation’ of the relevant regulations.”!** The other authorities
relied on by the Claimants can, the Respondent argues, be “dismissed swiftly as
irrelevant.”'®? Finally, the Respondent argues that the Claimants’ position in this case is a

“180° departure from the Claimants’ previous position” in Micula 1.'°°

Second, the Respondent argues that the Claimants have framed too broadly the element of
the FET standard creating an obligation to maintain a stable and consistent legal framework
and business environment. It is wrong to suggest that FET includes a stand-alone obligation
on the host State to stabilise its regulatory and legislative system, divorced from the
investor’s legitimate expectations, which can only arise from specific undertakings of the
State. Absent a contract with a stabilisation clause or another legally binding undertaking
or a clear representation (which the Claimants did not receive), States bear no substantive
obligation to ensure stability in the general sense, particularly in the context of significant

economic and/or political transition, such as the process of Romania’s accession to the EU.

The Respondent finds support for its position in Parkerings v Lithuania, Oxus v

Uzbekistan, Charanne v Spain, and Isolux v Spain.'6!

Third, the Respondent accepts that the FET standard encompasses an obligation to act in
good faith, but it characterizes the Claimants’ arguments in this regard again as articulating

an “overly broad legal standard.” !

Fourth, the Respondent also accepts that the FET standard encompasses a duty not to act
arbitrarily or unreasonably, or to discriminate against the foreign investor, noting that the
Parties agree that the two standards expressed in Article 2(3) of the Sweden-Romania BIT,
namely FET and prohibition of impairment of certain functions of the investment by

discriminatory or unreasonable measures, are closely linked.'°

The Respondent’s responses to the Claimants’ contention that it has violated all four

elements of the FET standard are set forth below.

 

(ii) Claimants’ A ions R ling Breach of Legitii E}

The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ allegations regarding breaches of legitimate
expectations, even if accepted at face value, would fail because “there is no representation,
express or implied, general or specific, regarding the enforcement of taxation in the spirits
market spirits that anyone in the Romanian government would have made to the Claimants

that would have induced them to invest in the spirits business.”!®

Further, the Respondent argues, the Claimants in any event mischaracterize the facts and
evidence. In particular, they argue that there is no evidence beyond “vague statement[s]”

of witnesses of any reliance by the Claimants upon alleged acts or representations of the

Respondent, and that evidence of the Respondent’s efforts to enforce its excise tax laws,
was not initially presented, and was, once presented, misleading.'® The Respondent also
emphasizes the inevitability of changes to taxation regulation given Romania’s EU
accession plans, rendering the idea that any official may have made representations that no
such changes were contemplated “inconceivable.” The Respondent argues that, contrary to
Claimants’ assertions, the function of a tax is to raise revenues for the state, and that the
increases in excise tax were made in part to cover increasing health costs arising from
alcohol consumption. Finally, the Claimants misrepresented the market evolution and the
actions of Romania. In particular, the Respondent asserts that, “[t]o the extent that
participants have not been willing to comply, but have attempted to avoid excise taxes due
to the State, the authorities have taken action consistently throughout the years.” Romania
provides statistics on the numbers of investigations it has undertaken and convictions it has
pursued. The Respondent says that these details repudiate the Claimants’ contention that
Romania “allowed” any party to evade its obligations. Rather, Romania took “reasonable
and cost-efficient efforts” and it is “neither economically cost-efficient nor [...] reasonable

social policy to aim at perfect enforcement of tax [...] laws.”'%

(iii) | Claimants’ Allegations Regarding Provision of a Stable Legal and Business
Framework
The Respondent argues that “[t]he Claimants’ claim for an alleged failure to provide a
stable and consistent legal framework and business environment is based on ‘the same
reasons’ as their claim for breach of their legitimate expectations. Accordingly, it adds very
little to the claim.”!©’ The Respondent emphasizes that the changes to the Romanian legal
framework were entirely legitimate and had been foreseeable since at least the early 2000s,
and, citing to Paushok v Mongolia, it asserts that “[...] no claim can arise from such steps

in the absence of a stabilisation clause prohibiting Romania from enacting new tax

The Claimants’ argument about a lack of stability in the business framework equally fails,
in the Respondent’s view. A State can only be held responsible for changes in the business
environment where those changes are due to its own actions, and the Claimants have
provided no evidence to support the notion that, to the extent that tax evasion occurred, this
was caused by Romania’s actions. To the contrary, the Respondent made “significant
efforts to fight the black market.”'® Respondent also emphasizes its view that the expert
evidence establishes that a large part of Scandic’s loss of sales was due to tax increases and

competitive pressures from other branded producers. !”°

(iv) Claimants’ Allegations Regarding Lack of Good Faith

The Respondent asserts that the Claimants’ arguments about bad faith add little to their
other arguments and constitute an unhelpful duplication of claims. In the Respondent’s
view, the Claimants are making serious allegations of bad faith “on the basis of the flimsiest
of evidence — innuendo and conjecture at best.” Measures taken by governments and
legislatures in areas such as alcohol consumption are nuanced and multifaceted and require
a balancing exercise to advance the public interest. In any event, as previously argued, the

Respondent did take measures to fight tax evasion in the alcohol sector.'7!

(vy) — Claimant’s Allegations of Unreasonable or Discriminatory Conduct

The Respondent dismisses the Claimants’ allegations of unreasonable or discriminatory
conduct as part of their FET claim for the same reasons as summarized in Section B(1)b)

below.!”

(vi) Lack of Benchmarks

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent emphasizes that the Claimants have failed to explain what
it is that Romania allegedly omitted to do (i.e., to provide any benchmark by which to

assess Romania’s conduct). In the Respondent’s view, the Claimants’ case for breach of

the FET standard is effectively an argument that Respondent’s efforts were not “enough,”
and which the Claimants seek to substantiate with “empty platitudes.” In short, the
Claimants “have failed to identify any standard or criteria that the Tribunal should apply
to determine what Romania should have done in order to comply with the FET

obligation.”!

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Claimants argue that Romania has breached its obligation under Article 2(3) of the
BIT to provide the Claimants with fair and equitable treatment in that it failed to enforce
its tax laws in a consistent manner and thereby fostered the growth of a substantial illegal

spirits market.

a. Applicable Law

The Parties make no specific submissions on the applicable law. The law relevant to this
case is found in the BIT between Sweden and Romania, the relevant provisions of the
ICSID Convention and any relevant rules of international law applicable to the
interpretation and application of the BIT as well as any rules of international law applicable

in the relationship between Sweden and Romania. !

However, a specific question about the content of the applicable law has arisen in respect
of the decision of the tribunal in Micula J. In their Reply, the Claimants argue that the
rulings in the Micula J decision regarding the applicable law are res judicata for this
Tribunal.'”> According to the Claimants, “Romania may not re-litigate [...] all the
questions linked to the meaning of the BIT provisions decided by the Micula v Romania |

tribunal.”!7

"73 Resp. Rej., paras. 446-449.

174 TCSID Convention, Article 42(1).

"5 The Claimants had also raised the question of res judicata effect of the Micula I decision in respect of jurisdiction
rationae personae (Cl. Mem., para. 455), but in view of the decision reached in this case, the Tribunal did not find it
necessary to deal with that argument.

176 Cl, Reply, para. 485.

99

350.

351.

352.

The Respondent challenges this application of the res judicata principle.'”’ It argues that
the parties to the two arbitrations are not identical in that some of the Claimants in this case
were not claimants in Micula J. The subject matter of the claims and their object are also
different. Micula J related to the effect of the withdrawal of tax incentives on, in particular,
the beer production, grain milling and packaging operations of the claimants in that case.
The present case does not concern the withdrawal of subsidies, nor is it focused on those
industries. It concerns the alleged failure of the Respondent to enforce its laws in respect
of the illegal sale of alcohol and the effect of this failure on the spirits products sold by the
Claimants. Moreover, the legal grounds for the present claims cannot be equated with
Micula I. The Respondent says that what the Claimants are trying to do is to tie it to
elements of the legal reasoning in Micula J applicable to the interpretation of the BIT,

something that is not a permissible application of the res judicata principle.

The Tribunal does not consider that the principle of res judicata has the effect in this case
that the Claimants contend. Although the parties are to some extent the same, the claims,
the conduct complained of, and the relief sought, are different in the two cases, requiring
the Tribunal to determine and apply the law in a very different context. Thus, the actual
decision of the Micula J tribunal could not have res judicata effect in respect of the facts
in this case. What the Claimants are seeking to do here is to use the res judicata principle
to restrict interpretations of the applicable law to interpretations adopted in the Micula I
award in a different setting. In other words, the scope of the reasoning to be utilized by this
Tribunal is to be fettered by the reasoning in Micula J. In the view of the Tribunal this is

not a proper invocation of the res judicata principle.

Of course, the Micula J decision, like the decisions of other investment tribunals, is relevant
and can be taken into account by this Tribunal. And, the closer other cases are to the legal
issues and factual circumstances of this case, the more persuasive the decisions in those
cases may become. But they have no more weight than that. The fact that the Parties had a
fundamentally different case before another investment tribunal does not make the

decisions of that tribunal or its reasoning res judicata.

b. The Scope of FET

Article 2(3) of the Sweden-Romania BIT provides that each party shall “at all times ensure
fair and equitable treatment of the investments by investors of the other Contracting Party.”
In general terms, the Parties do not disagree over the ambit of the obligation to provide fair
and equitable treatment, although the Claimants see the obligation as being broader in

scope than does the Respondent.

The Claimants cite the view of Dolzer and Schreuer that “the standard of FET is a broad
one, and its meaning will depend on the specific circumstances of the case at issue.”!”*
The Claimants contend, in particular, that an omission as well an act can constitute a failure
to comply with the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment. '” On the basis of the
position taken by other investment tribunals, the Claimants see four standards implicit in
the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment. These are: the protection of the
investor’s legitimate expectations; a duty to provide a stable, predictable and consistent
legal framework and business environment; an obligation to act in good faith; and a duty

not to act arbitrarily, unreasonably or to discriminate against the foreign investor. '*°

The Respondent claims that the standard of fair and equitable treatment is best summarized
in the Waste Management II decision.'*' While it agrees that a failure to fulfil the FET
obligation can result from an omission, it takes the view that this can be so only in

“exceptional circumstances.” !8?

The Respondent does not deny that a breach of any of the
standards identified by the Claimants could in principle constitute a denial of fair and

equitable treatment; it does deny that on the facts of this case, any such breach arises.

The Tribunal does not find it necessary to define in the abstract the scope of the obligation

to provide fair and equitable treatment. Instead it will look at the particular assertions of a

denial of fair and equitable treatment raised by the Claimants and consider each on its own

merits.

c. Protection of Legitimate Expectations

The Parties agree that the protection of legitimate expectations is “an important factor in
the FET standard.”!*? Indeed, the Claimants describe it as a “fundamental obligation of the
host state.”'** But they disagree about the scope of legitimate expectations and, as a

consequence, how it is to be applied in this case.

The essence of the Claimants’ case is that, when they invested in Romania, they had the
expectation that Romania would enforce its laws, in particular its laws relating to the
taxation of alcohol. They argue that “if legislation in force at the time of the investment
provides that sales of untaxed spirits are illegal, an investor is entitled to rely on the premise
that the legislation will be consistently applied in relation to the producers covered by the

tax obligation in question.”'*

The Claimants found their expectations on the state of the market when they started
operations and subsequent actions of the government up until around 2004, which, in the
Claimants’ view, evidenced an intention to enforce its tax laws. This included measures

taken in 1998 and following after increases in taxation on the production of spirits that

involved i d control to alcohol p Such measures

included a requirement that tax stamps be placed on alcohol products, the imposition of
penalties for failing to do so and requiring spirits producers to register and report to the
fiscal authorities. The Claimants claim that they saw these measures as positive
developments and that they were linked to an increase in their sales.'*° They saw the
introduction of a Tax Code in 2004 as a further indication that the Respondent would

enforce its laws.

363.

The Tribunal accepts that in appropriate cases, a breach of the obligation to provide fair
and equitable treatment can result from an omission as well as from positive action. The
Respondent argues that this can occur only in exceptional circumstances'*’ and that the
omission in this case — the alleged failures of compliance with taxation laws — was not an
omission in respect of the Claimants, but an omission in respect of third parties, the

producers of non-taxed spirits.

In the view of the Tribunal, the key question in this case is whether there was anything on
which the Claimants’ expectations could be based, so that the alleged omission or failure
of the Respondent could be treated as a basis for liability. The Parties agree that there was
no specific representation by the Respondent, although they differ on whether legitimate

expectations relied on by a party have to be based on a specific representation.

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that there does not have to be a specific
representation and that legitimate expectations can arise from a State’s acts or conduct.
However, to borrow the language used by Schreuer and Kriebaum, which the Claimants
cite with approval, what are the “general or specific assurances given by the host State” on
which the Claimants rely?'*® The acts or conduct upon which the Claimants rely are either
acts of general legislation or specific actions taken by the Respondent relating to the
enforcement of their taxation legislation — requiring tax stamps to be affixed to containers
of alcohol, requiring alcohol producers to register and report, developing a tax code. None
of these measures was specific in its application to the Claimants. These actions, together
with the general market condition at the time that the Claimants entered the market for
spirits in Romania created, the Claimants argue, an expectation that the Respondent would

continue to enforce its taxation laws relating to spirits.

What the Claimants rely on to ground their expectations at the time of investment are the

witness statements of the Micula brothers of their recollection of their expectations at that

time. And when the Claimants assert that “the Government continuously communicated
that it would not allow a massive expansion of a black spirits market at the expense of legal
operators,” '*? the support for this proposition consists of the actions taken by governments
in terms of legislation, such as the adoption of a tax code. There were no “communications”
from the government to the Claimants and no representations by government officials
subsequent to the Claimants’ investment. Moreover, there is no evidence establishing due
diligence taken by the Claimants to confirm the Micula brothers’ subjective expectations
or showing contacts with governments to provide reassurance. The representations or
assurances the Claimants invoke are inferences based not on what was said, but upon the
circumstances prevailing at the time of their investment, a belief that the market in which
they had entered would not change to their disadvantage, and the fact of subsequent

legislation relating to taxation of alcohol production and sale.

The Claimants believe that the market changed to their detriment as a result of the
Respondent’s omission in failing to satisfactorily enforce its taxation legislation. However,
the Tribunal has difficulty seeing the precision in the expectation asserted by the Claimants
that would give it some clear content to which liability could be attached. An expectation
that a state will enforce its laws is of a high degree of generality, even if it were restricted
to an expectation that a state would enforce its tax laws or taxation relating to alcohol. The
Claimants do not regard enforcement by the Respondent as adequate and assert that it was
not directed at the principal causes of the tax evasion problem. Yet they do not provide a
standard against which their expectation of adequate enforcement can be assessed, apart
from their belief that their loss of sales was attributable to a failure on the part of Romania

to enforce its tax laws and an assertion that other countries did things differently.

The evidence that the Claimants provide of the Respondent’s failure to enforce its laws
rests largely on inference derived from their allegation that black market sales had
increased to 90% of sales transactions. They argue that the statistics on enforcement
provided by the Respondent show that the State had not made any serious attempt to

enforce its taxation laws. The focus of enforcement, the Claimants argue, is monitoring

89 Cl. Mem., para. 501 (emphasis in original).

registered producers rather than concentrating on illegal producers,'°° and when illegal
production is found, the result generally is only a warning or a minimum or negligible
penalty.!°! The Claimants provide examples of the occurrence of illegal sales, such as in
markets and fairs, on roadsides and on the Internet. The Claimants also assert that Romania
could take measures to improve enforcement, such as focusing on home production and

authorizing police to enter houses to check for illegal production.

The Respondent argues that it did not fail to enforce its taxation laws. It cites the work of
the Romanian National Agency for Fiscal Administration (ANAF), the number of customs
controls over industrial production in the period 2007-2015 (a total of 157,946), the work
of the Financial Guard and the organ that replaced it, DG Anti-Fraud, and prosecutions
before the courts.'? With respect to home production, the Respondent points out the
difficulty in dealing with widely dispersed production, the social and cultural attachment
to the production of twica and palinca, the rights of homeowners and the laws regarding
entry into households. They point out, too, that over the period 2007-2015, a total of 34,796
customs controls were exercised by ANAF over individual households. !°* They also point
out that enforcement is guided in this field by the cost effectiveness of enforcement, taking
account of the dispersed individual households and the need to avoid social disorder, given

the special social and cultural importance of home production of twica and palinca.

The Tribunal agrees that there may be circumstances in which a failure to enforce laws
could amount to a denial of legitimate expectations and hence a breach of the obligation to
provide fair and equitable treatment. The GAM/ tribunal recognized that a failure to enforce
regulations could amount to a violation of NAFTA Article 1105 if it “amounted to an
‘outright and unjustified repudiation’ of the relevant regulations.”!°> The Claimants also

rely on the Zelena case where the tribunal found that there had been a “manifest, systematic

 

 

195 GAMI v. Mexico, UNCITRAL, Final Award (15 November 2004), at para. 103, CL-24.

105

and sweeping lack of application of Serbian legislation”!

relating to the treatment of
hazardous animal byproducts over a period of two years. Although in GAMI the tribunal
found no failure to provide fair and equitable treatment on the facts, in Zelena the tribunal

found that there had been a failure to meet the claimants’ legitimate expectations. '°7

368. However, the Tribunal does not consider that what the Claimants rely on to show that the
Respondent had failed to enforce its laws in this case meets the GAM/ test of an “outright
and unjustified repudiation” of its law. There is no “repudiation” of the standards set out
in the legislation. The Romanian government engages in the enforcement of its tax laws
relating to alcohol. It has a structure and personnel and investigations are carried out. Fines
are imposed and prosecutions occur. A budget of EUR 25 billion is allocated to taxation
enforcement and in a two-year period DG Anti-Fraud uncovered over EUR 2 billion in tax
evasion. !°8 Romania cannot be considered to have abandoned its authority in this field.
Thus, if the appropriate test for determining whether the Respondent has failed to enforce

its taxation laws is the GAMI test, then the Claimant’s argument must fail.

369. Equally, the Tribunal does not regard the Zelena decision as suggesting a different
conclusion in this case. In Ze/ena the claimants had engaged in significant due diligence
before deciding to invest, including meetings and correspondence with government
officials. Although the tribunal took the rather novel view that only promises or assurances

'S9 it nonetheless

that were legally binding could be the basis for legitimate expectations,
concluded that there was a “manifest, systematic and sweeping” lack of enforcement of the
relevant legislation that went beyond what the claimants could reasonably expect. Rather,
the tribunal said, what a claimant should be entitled to expect were “serious and visible
efforts at the implementation and enforcement of the relevant law.” 7°°

370. In the view of this Tribunal, Romania has engaged in “serious and visible” efforts to

enforce its taxation laws relating to alcohol. The Claimants’ argument that Romania has

373.

failed to enforce its alcohol taxation laws is really a disagreement about how Romania has
gone about enforcement. In the view of the Claimants, Romania should have gone about
enforcement differently. But this does not demonstrate that there have been no “serious
and visible” efforts at enforcement or that there has been a “manifest, systematic and
sweeping failure” to enforce the law. Thus, the Ze/ena case provides no support to the

Claimants.

In light of the above, the Tribunal does not consider that the Claimants have established
that there has been a failure by Romania to enforce its taxation laws. The Claimants clearly
feel that the Respondent could do more and they doubt the effectiveness of the measures
taken by Romania to enforce its taxation regime with respect to alcohol. However, the
Respondent has established that it has a sophisticated mechanism for the enforcement of
its laws, a strategy of ensuring that enforcement is cost-effective and a structure for
enforcement at both the household producer and industrial producer levels, involving
ANAF, Customs and DG Anti-Fraud. Illegal activities have been uncovered and fines

levied. None of this can be characterized as a failure to enforce taxation laws.

As a result, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have failed to establish that there
was a denial of their legitimate expectations on the basis of a failure by the Respondent to

enforce its taxation laws relating to alcohol.

d. Failure to Provide a Stable and Consistent Legal Framework and Business
Environment

The Claimants also argue, as an aspect of their claim to fair and equitable treatment, that
the Respondent failed to provide a stable and consistent legal framework and business
environment. As a result of a combination of increased taxes, which “incentivized” tax
avoiders,”"! and a failure to enforce its tax laws, the Claimants argue, the Respondent has
facilitated the growth of a large illegal black market, which made it impossible for legal
operators to compete. This change in the legal and business environment was in breach of

the Respondent’s obligation to maintain a stable legal environment.

201 Cl, Mem., para. 520.

107

374.

375.

376.

377.

  

The Respondent contests the Claimants’ view that it is under an obligation to maintain a
stable legal environment in the absence of a stabilisation clause. The Claimants could not
have had, the Respondent argue, the legitimate expectations they claim, because any
investor has to expect that a market will change and that legislation will change. In the
circumstances of Romania, which was going through a process of political and economic
transition and engaged in negotiations to be admitted to membership of the European
Union, changes to the legal framework involving increases in taxation were “entirely

legitimate and foreseeable.”

In the view of the Tribunal, the Claimants’ argument about a stable legal and business
environment is simply a different formulation of its argument that the Respondent had
failed to enforce its tax laws. Had the Respondent enforced its tax laws in the way that the
Claimants argue it should, then, according to the Claimants, the legal and business
environment would not have changed. However, the Tribunal has concluded that the
Claimants have not proved a failure by the Respondent to enforce its taxation laws and thus

its arguments relating to a stable legal and business environment must also fail.

e. Good Faith

The Claimants argue that Romania had not acted in good faith in failing to enforce its
taxation laws. They point out that the EU had stated during the negotiations on EU
admission that an increase in Romania’s administrative capacity to enforce taxation laws
would be necessary.”°> The Claimants also state that non-governmental organizations had
pointed this out to Romania as well.? Thus, the Claimants argue, Romania was fully
aware of the consequences of not making adequate provision for the enforcement of its

taxation laws.

The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ claim of failure to act in good faith was based

on “innuendo and conjecture, at best.”?°5 It points out that the increases in taxation between

the period 2003-2007 were required as a result of entering the EU and that the exercise of
government powers of enforcement are based on a variety of factors in the public interest

and not just the concerns of the industrial-based producers of alcohol.

The Tribunal notes that allegations of bad faith require a high standard of proof, particularly

where, as the Claimants point out, its argument is based on Romania’s 1.7208

state of min
But there is an initial hurdle. A claim that Romania acted in bad faith in failing to enforce
its tax laws requires proof that Romania has in fact failed to enforce its laws. However, the
Tribunal has already concluded that the Claimants have not shown that Romania had failed
to enforce its laws. Thus, there is no basis for a claim that Romania failed to act in good

faith in not enforcing its tax laws.

f Unreasonable or Discriminatory Conduct

This aspect of the Claimants’ argument is essentially identical to the Claimants’ additional
claim under Article 2(3) of the BIT that the Respondent has taken discriminatory and

unreasonable measures, which is addressed in the section below.

UNREASONABLE AND DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES

The Claimants argue that Respondent has taken discriminatory and unreasonable measures
in violation of Article 2(3) of the BIT.
(i) The Applicable Standard

On the Claimants’ case, an “unreasonable measure” is the same as an “arbitrary measure”
in the relevant jurisprudence; this standard of treatment protects investors against “a wilful
disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial

propriety.”?°’ A measure need not be outrageous to be unreasonable or arbitrary; rather,

tribunals have found unreasonable (i) damaging measures that had no apparent legitimate
purpose; (ii) measures based on discretion, prejudice or personal preference; and (iii)
measures taken for reasons other than those publicly given, or undertaken without engaging
in a rational decision making process.”°* The Claimants rely on the Award in AES v
Hungary, in which the tribunal found that reasonableness should be analysed on the basis
of two elements: (i) the existence of a rational policy (i.e., a policy that has a logical (good
sense) explanation and aims to address a public interest matter), and (ii) the reasonableness
of the act in question (i.e., whether there is an appropriate correlation between the State’s

public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it).

382. As for discriminatory measures, the Claimants argue that no intent to discriminate is
necessary for there to be a violation of Article 2(3). As held in LG&E v Argentina and
Siemens v Argentina, it is sufficient that the host State’s action or omission be
discriminatory in effect.?'° A measure will be discriminatory in effect “if it results in a
treatment of an investor different from that accorded to other investors in a similar or
comparable situation;” i.e., if similar cases are treated differently without reasonable
justification.7!! Moreover, in order for a measure or conduct to constitute discrimination,
it need not be specifically directed towards the disfavoured foreign investors, but could

manifest itself e.g., in the form of tax rules which indirectly favour domestic operators.7!*

Claimants, but not as concerns all — or even the majority — of other operators producing

and selling similar spirits on the Romanian market.?!>

In this regard, the Claimants argue that illegal operators are engaged in precisely the same
business as the Claimants (i.e., the production and sale of spirits in Romania), and hence it
is proper, and in accordance with the findings of the tribunal in Apotex Holdings v United
States, to compare the treatment of the Claimants with that of the illegal operators.?!4
Moreover, Romania’s failure to identify and stop illegal producers was — and still is —
discriminatory, at least in effect, in that this differential treatment has resulted in a distorted
market, creating a competitive advantage for the beneficially treated illegal operators.7!>
Finally, there is no reasonable justification for Romania’s differential treatment of the
Claimants as compared to the black market operators. In particular, there is no conceivable
public interest that could justify this discrimination (but rather, there is a clear public

interest associated with non-discriminatory enforcement of laws and regulations).”!°

In their Reply, the Claimants dispute a number of the arguments made by the Respondent

in its Counter-Memorial.

First, with respect to the Respondent’s argument that illegal home producers are not the
correct comparators for the analysis, the Claimants contend that all other producers that
sell spirits are in a comparable situation in all respects pertinent to assessing Romania’s
violations of the BIT. All spirits sales are subject to payment of an excise tax and spirits
offered for sale must be produced in a tax warehouse. While the rate of the excise tax may
differ, the same legal requirements to pay excise tax and comply with the tax warehouse
regulations apply to all producers of spirits for sale in Romania. The Claimants suggest

that the award in Grand River v USA supports the view that important weight is to be

assigned to whether there are “like legal requirements.””!’ They argue that, contrary to the
Respondent’s contentions, the relevant case law in fact confirms that all producers subject
to the same legal requirements are deemed to be in like circumstances for the purposes of

determining whether a State’s measures were discriminatory.”!*

Second, the Claimants reject the distinction drawn by the Respondent between companies
like the Claimants that operate through tax warehouses, and home producers and small
distilleries that do not. In particular, the Claimants argue that small distilleries are obliged
to hold fiscal warehouse licenses, and moreover, the fact that illegal producers do not
possess such licenses is merely evidence of the failure to enforce the laws in a non-

discriminatory manner.?!”

Third, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s contention that the criteria the Claimants have
applied are inapposite. In Apotex, the case on which the Claimants rely, contrary to the
Respondent’s suggestion, the tribunal did not have to consider whether differing legal
regimes were in themselves discriminatory. Rather, the tribunal addressed discrimination

in the enforcement of a legal regime fully analogous to that under consideration here.?”°

Finally, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that other industrial-scale
producers are treated “exactly the same.” It points in this regard to “[t]he fact that
Romania’s officials deliberately chose to allow certain producers to produce alcohol while
their licenses had been revoked” (referencing the treatment given to producer Euroavipo)
and argues that Romania turns a blind eye to 60-70% of the producers in the commercial
market that sell spirits at prices that do not even cover the cost of production and taxes.
This demonstrates that Romania does not treat industrial-scale producers of spirits

equally.??!

(iii) Unreasonable Measures

390. The Claimants also argue that the Respondent’s choice to enforce its spirits tax laws only
in relation to some spirits producers also constituted unreasonable and arbitrary measures,

impairing Claimants’ investments.

391. In the Claimants’ view, such behaviour offends every reasonable and impartial person, and
does not serve a legitimate purpose. Rather, the choice was biased and politically
motivated, and there were reasonable alternatives available. Moreover, the Respondent’s
choice was not the result of a rational decision-making process that considered the effect
of the measure on foreign investments and the balance of the interests of the State. In
support of this contention, the Claimants point to evidence that the choice has also resulted
in negative health and environmental outcomes for Romania, as well as a loss of tax
revenue. Relatedly, the Claimants assert that it would be “relatively easy” for Romania to
increase its enforcement activities.”

392. The Claimants argue that previous arbitral tribunals have examined whether the measure
alleged to be unreasonable or arbitrary was the result of a rational decision-making process.
This analysis includes the examination of the existence of a genuine public purpose and of
a reasonable relationship between the aims pursued by the State and the effectiveness of
the measures taken. They point in this regard to Saluka v Czech Republic and AES Summit
v Hungary.? They also contend that the Respondents reliance on the ELSI case and its
reference to a “reasonable correlation between the [rational] policy and the act that aims to
implement the policy” is entirely misplaced. It is simply not possible for Romania to argue
that the disputed conduct aimed to implement a rational policy, the Claimants argue,

because Romania’s conduct did the very opposite.?”4

In addition, the Claimants argue that Romania’s implementation of rules permitting
household production of alcohol at a level that significantly exceeds personal consumption
was also unreasonable within the meaning of Article 2(3) of the BIT. There was no
reasonable justification for doing this; the thresholds implemented exceeded personal
consumption by a wide margin, whereas such consumption was the only stated justification

for maintaining the household rules.??>

In this regard, the Claimants reject the
Respondent’s argument that the Claimants misunderstand the so-called “household rules”
on fruit-growers’ spirits production for personal consumption. Although the Claimants
maintain their view that these rules were arbitrary, what is relevant for the purpose of the
Claimants’ damages claim is not the “household rules” as such, but Romania’s failure to
enforce its laws in relation to illegal producers who illegally sold spirits without (i) holding
a fiscal warehouse license and (ii) paying the applicable taxes on spirits sales. In the
Claimants’ view, the record shows that significant quantities of home-produced spirits are
sold on the black market and that Romania has failed to provide evidence of any real effort
to ensure household compliance with relevant rules. Rather, Romania’s authorities

principally conducted scheduled inspections of registered producers.””°

b. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that it has not impaired the Claimants’ enjoyment of their
investments by unreasonable or discriminatory measures. In the Respondent’s view, the
Claimants’ arguments under this claim fail for the same reasons as the Claimants’ full
protection and security claim; nevertheless, the Respondent addresses both allegations

separately in their pleadings for the “sake of conceptual accuracy.”??7

(i) The Applicable Standard

With respect to the determination of whether Romania’s measures were discriminatory, the
Respondent argues that the “critical question” for the Tribunal is to determine what might

be comparable situations. The key question in this context is whether the alleged

 

71-573.
. 628-630.

 

27 Resp. Rej., para. 450.

114

comparator was subject to the same legal regime as the Claimants. In this regard, the
Respondent notes that even where two companies “operate in the same industry and are
subject to same kind of rules,” they are not necessarily in a “like situation.” Rather,
tribunals must look carefully at the circumstances in order to determine whether they are
indeed comparable. The alternative criteria proposed by the Claimants are inapposite, as
they are derived from case law where the tribunals concerned were considering whether
differing legal rules constituted in themselves discriminatory treatment — and that is not the

claim alleged here.??*

396. As regards the claim of unreasonable measures, the Respondent contends that the
Claimants’ articulation of the applicable standard sets the standard too low, and neglects
the main authority, which is the ICJ’s ruling in the ELS/ case. That case emphasizes that
“Ta]rbitrariness is [...] something opposed to the rule of law [...] a wilful disregard of due
process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety.”???

While the Parties agree that there must be a reasonable correlation between the policy and

any act that aims to implement the policy, in the Respondent’s view, given the applicable

ELSI standard, the margin of appreciation granted to the State is wide:

It is up to States to determine what policies to pursue and how. Only
in the extreme circumstance where the correlation between the two
is so remote or artificial as to “shock[], or at least surprise[], a
sense of juridical propriety” would this amount to an unreasonable
measure in breach of Article 2(3) of the Sweden-Romania BIT.?°°

(ii) Discriminatory Measures

397. The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ contention that the spirits producers that do not pay
taxes are engaged in precisely the same business as the Claimants and thus that they are in
a comparable situation. Two categories of producers in Romania are subject to a different
legal regime than that applicable to Scandic, Claimants’ primary alcohol brand, and thus

are not, by definition, in a similar situation to Scandic: home producers of fruit-based

brandy, and small distilleries that produce less than 10 hectolitres of alcohol per year.
Thus, only the industrial-scale producers of alcohol are the applicable comparators. These
producers are treated exactly the same across the board. In the Respondent’s view,
“criminals” cannot be the appropriate comparator — but even if the Tribunal were minded
to consider them as such, the Respondent has demonstrated an absence of discrimination
in the extensive measures it has taken, and is taking, to prevent and fight tax evasion in the
alcohol sector.?*!

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent first emphasized that home sales have been recognised by
the Romanian legislature as a separate market from that of large-scale producers, including
through the imposition of a much-reduced tax rate. Moreover, the two markets have
historically been subject to two different customs regimes. Second, with regard to Apotex
v USA, on which the Claimants rely as being analogous to the present case, the Respondent
emphasizes that the Claimants are advancing a claim different from that advanced in
Apotex. Third, as to Claimants’ invocation of the treatment of the producer Euroavipo, the
Respondent argues that it is “unclear what is the ‘treatment’ that Romania gave Euroavipo

and failed to give the Claimants.”?*?

(iii) | Unreasonable Measures

The Respondent also rejects the Claimants’ allegation that the measures taken by Romania
with regard to increasing spirits taxes and its manner of enforcing its rules constitute

unreasonable measures.

The Respondent argues that increasing the level of excise tax in the alcohol sector in 2002-
2007 and introducing stricter regulatory requirements was not a “choice” for Romania —
except to the extent that seeking accession to the EU was a choice. Moreover, the notion
that there was a “choice” by Romania not to enforce its laws is wrong and nonsensical. The
first and main victim of tax evasion is the State itself, and Romania has always sought to
control manufacturing and sale of alcohol and curb tax evasion. The Respondent argues

that the setting of tax rates and institutional arrangements for tax collection and

enforcement in Romania have been to some extent exercises in “trial and error,” as is to be
expected from any state undergoing as profound a transition as Romania has faced since
the 1989 revolution. In the Respondent’s view, the Claimants demonstrate a “complete
lack of understanding of the difficulties as well as unavoidable cost and policy
considerations inherent in law enforcement in this area.” The Respondent rejects the notion
that it had a policy of enforcing regulations only in relation to those operators that
voluntarily complied with the law, commenting that, “[t]o state that the existence of
criminal activity shows that there is a policy of enforcing laws only against those that abide
by the laws is nonsense.” Finally, Respondent argues that Claimants’ argument regarding
the “personal consumption” limits is misconceived, in that it fails to account for cultural
traditions of gifting in Romania, and in any event overlooks that production within these

limits is for personal use and not sale.?*>

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent first emphasised that Claimants’ criticisms of the ways
Romania acted to enforce its laws ignores the obvious question: “What should Romania
have done in order to allegedly act ‘reasonably’?” Second, it rejected the Claimants’
complaint that enforcement efforts focused on scheduled inspections of registered
producers, arguing that the Claimants manipulated the statistics and that in reality
“customs’ controls [...] target [...] shops, wholesalers, markets and in traffic rather than
registered producers.” Relatedly, the Respondent disputes the Claimants’ account of the

relevant statistics regarding the size of the black market as well as the tax-gap.7*4

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Claimants argue that the Respondent treated them in a discriminatory and
unreasonable way, both as an aspect of the failure to provide fair and equitable treatment
and as an additional violation of Article 2(3) of the Sweden-Romania BIT which provides,
in addition to fair and equitable treatment, that each party: “shall not impair the

management, enjoyment, use or disposal thereof [of investments], as well as the acquisition

of goods or services or the sale of their production through unreasonable or discriminatory

measures.”

a. Discrimination

The Claimants argue that the Respondent breached the non-discrimination requirement “by
enforcing its tax laws and regulatory requirements relating to the production of spirits as
concerns the Claimants, but not as concerns all — or even the majority — of other operators

producing and selling similar spirits on the Romanian market.””>> The Claimants also
repeat the assertion that the Respondent raised taxes without providing for enforcement of

those taxes, hence penalizing those who actually paid the taxes.

The Respondent denies that it discriminated in this way. It argues that the Claimants are
essentially complaining about the fact that taxes were raised. In essence, they want a
dispensation from paying the higher taxes,”*° an assertion that the Claimants deny. The
Respondent further argues that in making their discrimination claim, the Claimants are not
using the right comparator. They are arguing that discrimination occurred because
household producers were treated differently from industrial spirits producers, but the two

groups were not in competition.?*”

The question for the Tribunal is whether there was in fact differential treatment by the
Respondent of the Claimants compared with other producers of spirits of a kind prohibited

by the BIT.

The Claimant’s argument is that there is improper differential treatment between producers
who pay taxes and producers who do not, described by the Claimants as “illegal operators”
and “black market operators.” Into this category the Claimants place all producers of spirits
who do not pay taxes. The differential action of the Respondent in the enforcement of its

taxation of sprits has, the Claimants argue, a discriminatory effect on its sales of its

products. To make good this argument, the Claimants have to support their contention that

the Respondent has failed to enforce its taxation laws.

There are, as the Respondent points out, two quite distinct categories of spirits producers
— home producers and industrial-scale producers — and the taxation basis for each is
different. Home producers have a lower taxation rate. The Respondent argues that these
producers are not in like circumstances with the Claimants, which are industrial producers,

and thus the appropriate comparator group is other industrial producers of spirits.

In the context of the FET claim, the Tribunal concluded that the Claimants failed to
establish that there had been a “manifest, systematic and sweeping” rejection by Romania
of its enforcement laws and regulations. The Respondent engaged in “serious and visible”

enforcement of its taxation laws. Is this sufficient in the context of a discrimination claim?

The Claimants do not make a separate argument about what constitutes a failure to enforce
in the context of their discrimination claim, nor do they accept the Respondent’s contention
about there being different comparator groups. Their comparison is between those who pay
taxes and those who do not. The discrimination argument depends on a blanket conclusion,
asserted in the FET claim, that Romania has failed to enforce its laws. And that argument
is based largely on an inference drawn from the disputed facts of non-enforcement. The
Claimants’ experts argue that 90% of the spirits sold in Romania are untaxed;”* the
Respondent disputes those figures, arguing that the facts are more in line with the
assessment of their expert, who identifies the appropriate tax gap as being in the range of
55-80% which is in line with the tax gap in comparator countries such as Bulgaria and

Hungary.??

The Claimants suggest a variety of ways in which the Respondent could improve its
enforcement system, citing what has been done in Slovakia, and suggest that inaction in
enforcement by Romania reflects a deliberate choice not to enforce. The Respondent denies

that there is any basis for concluding that there exists a policy not to enforce taxation laws,

and urges that enforcement has to be considered in the particular context of Romania. The
Romanian situation, it argues, is characterized by a highly rural society, a low level of
income, a large number of small producers, and a tradition of home-based production of

plum-based spirits — twica and palinca.

The Tribunal has already concluded that the Respondent has not failed to enforce their
taxation laws, in that it has devoted substantial resources to enforcement, it has engaged in
controls over production activity in respect of both home production and industrial-scale
production, and it has prosecuted tax evaders. While the evidence before the Tribunal
undoubtedly shows that there is widespread evasion of taxes in relation to the production
of spirits in Romania, it equally shows that there is a widespread pattern of enforcement
activities against tax evaders. No doubt enforcement could be improved, but the evidence
before the Tribunal does not admit of the conclusion that there has been a failure to enforce
taxation laws against spirits producers as a group or failure to enforce against home

producers or against illicit industrial-scale producers.

To the extent that the Claimants are arguing that there has not been sufficient enforcement,
the Tribunal has not been provided with any standard by which to measure sufficiency. The
Claimants cite Slovakia, but as the Respondent’s expert has shown, Romania has its unique
characteristics, such as rurality, low income levels and a strong tradition of home-made
spirits, that affect the extent to which enforcement, which was effective in, say, Slovakia,

may be effective in the Romanian context.“

In the end, the Claimants are saying they have been discriminated against, because some
producers have avoided paying taxes on their spirits production. But that is too broad a
proposition on which to found a claim of discrimination. A finding of discrimination
depends, as with Claimants’ other arguments, on a finding that Romania has failed to
enforce its tax laws. But, as the Tribunal has concluded, the claim that there has been a
failure by Romania to enforce its laws has not been substantiated. Hence the claim that

there has been discrimination must also fail.

6. Unreasonableness

The Claimants argue that the decision of Romania to implement steep tax increases within
a short period of time without enforcing those increases against all operators was
unreasonable.”*! In stating their claim in this way, and focusing on enforcement against
“all” operators, the Claimants linked their unreasonableness claim directly to the claim of
discrimination. As a result, the claim to unreasonableness has the same difficulties as the

claim to discrimination.

Relying on AES v Hungary, the Claimants argue that to meet the test of reasonableness,
government action or inaction must be taken in pursuance of a rational policy.?4? The
Claimants list a variety of ways in which failing to enforce taxation laws could not be
regarded as a rational policy, in particular because it left unregulated a substantial volume
of spirits production with negative implications for safety and health and deprived the
government of substantial revenues that could be gained from proper tax enforcement. The
Claimants also argue that enhancing enforcement could have been done easily by Romania
given the undisguised sales of illegal spirits, the ease of enforcement in open markets and
of controlling prices by retailers.“

However, the basic premise of the Claimants’ argument on unreasonableness is that the
Respondent has failed to enforce its taxation laws or has enforced them against some
producers but not against others. But the claim that the Respondent has failed to enforce

's action in

 

its tax laws has been rejected by the Tribunal and thus the claim that Romani:

the enforcement of its taxation laws was unreasonable must also be rejected.

FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY
(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. Claimants’ Position

The Claimants argue that although the Sweden-Romania BIT does not specifically provide
for the full protection and security of investments (“FPS”) made by investors of
Contracting Parties, its Most-Favoured Nation Clause (“MFN Clause”) in Article 3(1)
allows investors to invoke a substantive standard of protection contained in another
investment protection treaty entered into by the host State with a third party. They therefore
invoke (i) Article 4(1) of the Romania-Albania BIT, which provides that “investments by
investors of either Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection and security;” and (ii)
Article 3(1) of the Romania-Iran BIT, which provides that “[iJinvestments of investors of
either Contracting Party [...] shall receive the host Contracting Party’s full legal protection

[...]-’244 On the Claimants’ case, the Respondent violated its FPS obligations.

(i) Applicable Standard

In the Claimants’ view, the FPS standard imposes a positive obligation on the host State to
protect investments and requires the host State to exercise reasonable care to achieve that
objective. The scope of the protection extends beyond just physical protection of real and
tangible property to legal protection. In this regard, the Claimants emphasize the explicit

reference to “legal protection” in the Romania-Iran BIT.?*>

In their Reply, the Claimants dispute Respondent’s contention that the interpretation of the
FPS standard that “favours limiting the clause to protection from physical interference by
third parties is to be preferred” and should be adopted by this Tribunal. That, the Claimants
argue, is an outdated standard and fails in that it (i) does not accurately describe the

standard of protection in customary international law as it has evolved into the 21‘ century,

 

s. 574-577, citing to “Agreement between the government of Romania and the government of the

Republic of Albania for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, made on 11 May 1994,” C-242, and
“Agreement between the government of Romania and the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran on the promotion
and reciprocal protection of investments, made on 26 January 2003,” C-243.

and (ii) is irreconcilable with the text, context and object and purpose of the BIT provisions

at issue. Moreover, the authorities relied on by the Respondent in support of its narrow

interpretation of the FPS standard have been superseded by subsequent awards.”"°

420. The Claimants also reject the Respondent’s contention that if the standard is not limited to
physical protection, it will be “subsumed in and conflated with the obligation to provide
FET.” In the Claimants’ view, FET and the FPS obligations are stated in many BITs as
independent concepts, reflecting the intention of the drafters to recognize them as two

separate and distinct obligations undertaken by a State — as tribunals have recognized.”4”

421. Equally, the Claimants object to the Respondent’s argument that the protection offered in
Article 3(1) of the Romania-Iran BIT “overall” is no more favourable than that offered in
Article 4(1) of the Romania-Albania BIT, so that there is no treatment granted by Article
3(1) of the Romania-Iran BIT to be imported by the use of the MFN clause. In the

Claimants’ view, this strained interpretation disregards the clear text of Article 3(1) of the

248,

Romania-Iran BIT,“” which makes clear that investments receive two separate guarantees

(“full legal protection” as well as “fair treatment not less favourable” than treatment
afforded to Romanian or other investors). Moreover, the Respondent’s interpretation of

Article 3(1) is not made in accordance with its ordinary meaning and in light of the treaty’s

object and purpose, as required by the VCLT.*"?

422. As to the content of the FPS standard, the Claimants cite a variety of holdings by prior
tribunals, to emphasize, inter alia: (i) that FPS can be undermined by legislative and
administrative action or by a failure to take reasonable preventative action (including in the

face of a threat to the investor’s ability to operate its business on a level playing field); (ii)

that FPS includes a guaranty of stability in a secure environment (including commercial
and legal); (iii) that the FPS obligations apply regardless of whether the State whose
conduct is under examination is underdeveloped; (iv) that the standard is an absolute one,
irrespective of protections being provided by the State to its own nationals; and (v) that

breach gives rise to an obligation to restore the previous situation.?*”

(ii) Failure to Accord FPS

The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s failure properly to enforce its alcohol tax laws

and prevent the growth of the illegal spirits market constitutes a failure to accord FPS.

On the Claimants’ case, the Respondent is liable both for the deficiencies in its legislation
and for deficiencies in its authorities’ performance in carrying out the State’s directives.
Romania’s actions must be compared to those of a well-administered government, and it
is not credible or acceptable that a well-administered government would allow black
market operators to take over an entire market. In this regard, the Claimants emphasize
that Romania established that it had an “adequate legal system” when acceding to the

EUs!

In considering the Respondent’s actions, the Claimants argue that Romania has failed to
exercise basic due diligence to prevent the wide-spread growth of the black market in the
spirits sector. They point in this regard to their view that the illegal spirits market has
accounted for approximately 90% of spirits consumption in Romania since 2005.7

In addition, the Claimants argue that Romania also failed to provide full legal protection
and security by enacting the distorted versions of the household rules, which further
incentivised and facilitated the proliferation of the spirits black market, and in turn affected

the Claimants’ ability to operate normally on a level playing field.?*

The Respondent, the Claimants contend, has failed to restore the previous situation. The
legal spirits market is now stuck at a level representing less than 10% of the total spirits

consumption in Romania.?*+

In their Reply, the Claimants first argue that there is no merit in Romania’s argument that
the Claimants should have “notified the State of the risk” of harm that could result from
tax evasion and the proliferation of the black market. In the Claimants’ view, such risks
are assessed by law enforcement agencies of any State and are well documented here.
Moreover, the EU specifically warned Romania of the black market risk due to the increase
of excise taxes. Finally, the record establishes that Romania fully understood that legal
producers such as the Claimants would be severely prejudiced should Romania increase
taxes but fail to enforce them, pointing in particular to express statements released by
Romania. In any event, the Claimants argue, the authorities cited by the Respondent in
support of its “notification” argument are inapposite — they concern acts of physical
violence against select individuals and their property, not economic and financial injury

caused to an entire market on account of largescale illegal activity.7>>

Second, the Claimants argue that Romania is also wrong to contend that it cannot be held
responsible for the “indirect effect of actions taken by unidentified third parties.” On any
interpretation, the FPS standard extends to protection against interference by third parties.
Moreover, the preventive and repressive measures against third parties contemplated by

the FPS standard fall within the ambit of State powers.”°°

b. Respondent’s Position
The Respondent accepts that the effect of the MFN clause in Article 3(2) of the BIT is to
incorporate “higher protection[s]” contained in the Romania-Albania and Romania-Iran

BITs. However, it disputes the existence of such higher protections, rejects the Claimants’

articulation of the applicable FPS standard, and denies that its actions gave rise to a breach

of the FPS standard.

(i) Applicable Standard

As to the scope of what is incorporated, the Respondent rejects the notion that the Romania-
Iran BIT’s reference to “full legal protection” somehow creates a higher level of protection.
In the Romania-Iran BIT, there is no self-standing FET standard. Rather, Iranian investors
are entitled to the protection that Romania’s laws provide, as well as to fair treatment to
the extent that this is granted to other investors. This overall is not treatment more
favourable than that granted by the Sweden-Romania BIT to Swedish investors and
therefore cannot be imported by the use of the MFN clause in Article 3(1) of the Sweden-

Romania BIT.?*”

As to the precise meaning of FPS, the Respondent contends that there is no “jurisprudence
constante” among investment treaty tribunals on the scope of an FPS provision. In the
Respondent’s submission, the interpretation that favours limiting the clause to protection
from physical interference by third parties, a reading which respects the original meaning
of the clause, is the more appropriate reading of the provisions the Claimants rely on. The
Respondent relies on the decisions of tribunals in Saluka v Czech Republic, PSEG v Turkey,
BG v Argentina, and Noble Ventures v Romania, in support of its position. And, if the
standard of FPS is not limited to protection from physical interference, the Respondent
argues, then “it becomes subsumed in and conflated with the obligation to provide FET”
and any consideration on this basis should be undertaken “in light of the considerations
and limitations that apply to such other concepts, in particular the legitimate expectations

of the Claimants.”?5*

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ contention that the notion that FPS

is limited to physical security is “outdated.” It argues that, even if this were the case, “the

Claimants are attempting to import protection from a treaty concluded in 1994 — at the time
when the alleged “evolution” was yet to take place. Thus, it is the “unevolved” protection
that they are entitled to, “not an alleged customary law standard that may be something
different today than what it was in 1994.” In any event, the Respondent contends, there is
no support for the notion of an evolved standard, and the case law, including Crystallex v

Venezuela, does not support this notion.?°°

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ contention that FPS requires a state to ensure a
“level playing field.” It argues that the Claimants’ contention takes the standard well
beyond its natural or intended remit, not just equating it with the FET standard, but going
beyond it. There is no obligation on a State under investment treaties or otherwise to shield
a market player from the effects of competition — or from legitimate regulatory action that

may have an uneven impact on different businesses.”

Finally, the Respondent comments that the standard of FPS protection is that of due
diligence, which requires the State to “take reasonable actions within its power” to prevent
harm. The protection that must be provided against the acts of third parties is not the same
as the protection that a State must provide against the acts of its own organs. And whether
the allegedly injured party notified the State of the risk is critical to the assessment of

whether a State has breached its duty of due diligence.”

(ii) Failure to Accord FPS

According to the Respondent, the Claimants’ claim must fail. Romania has not taken any
action against them, nor has it failed to prevent any third parties from taking action against
them, whether on the “physical” or the “legal” plane. The Claimants’ claim, arising from

indirect effects of third-party action is a stretch even on the Claimants’ own concept of

expanded “legal security.” By contrast, the cases the Claimants cite all involved action

taken by the State towards the investor directly.7

With regard to the Claimants’ allegations that Romania tolerated the widespread black
market, and thereby failed to maintain a secure legal and commercial environment, the
Respondent states that this claim fails for the same reasons as the Claimants’ FET claim.
In addition, it points out that there is no evidence that the Claimants ever notified Romania
of the risk before 2010, when the Respondent intensified its fight against tax evasion.
Moreover, the Respondent argues, even if the Tribunal accepted as applicable the standard
for which the Claimants argue, the obligation would still only be one of due diligence, and
there is no question that this standard has been met (and the burden lies with the Claimants
to establish a failure to exercise due diligence). The Respondent emphasizes that its efforts

were increased once complaints — including those from the Claimants — were received.?®

Finally, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ allegations pertaining to the rules governing
household protection of traditional spirits — these rules are reasonable in the circumstances,
and, in any event, enacting different rules for different products could never constitute a
failure to provide FPS. Also rejected are the Claimants’ complaints about Romania’s
alleged failure to restore the previous situation. In the Respondent’s submission, the
Claimants are not entitled to the entirely outdated tax rates from 2002. In addition, they
have provided no evidence of any “good old days” with regard to enforcement against tax
evasion from which the situation deteriorated. Rather, enforcement has improved over

time.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Claimants argue that an obligation to provide full protection and security, although not
specifically provided for in the Sweden-Romania BIT can be imported by the MFN

provision in Article 3(1) which provides:

Each Contracting Party shall apply to investments made in its
territory by investors of the other Contracting Party a treatment
which is no less favourable than that accorded to investments made
by its own investors or investors of third States, whichever is more
favourable to the investor.

This has the result, the Claimants argue, that provisions on FPS can be imported from the

Romania-Albania BIT and the Romania-Iran BIT.?°>

Article 4(1) of the Romania-Albania BIT provides, “investments by investors of either

Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection and security.”

Article 3(1) of the Romania-Iran BIT provides, “investments of either Contracting Party

shall [...] receive the host Contracting Party’s full legal protection.”

The Respondent does not disagree in principle with the application of the MFN provision
in Article 3(1) of the Sweden-Romania BIT to import provisions on full protection and

security, but it disagrees with the implications that the Claimants seek to draw from it.

The Claimants take the view that full protection and security is not limited to physical
protection, but covers “legal protection” as well which, in any event, is included
specifically in the Romania-Iran BIT.?°’ Such protection includes, in the view of the
Claimants, protection of an investor’s ability to “operate its business on a level playing
field.”?°* The Claimants then argue that the Respondent's failure to enforce its laws within

the spirits sector has deprived it of full security and protection.

The Respondent denies that full protection and security includes legal protection. It points
out that the wording of the Romania-Iran BIT is, in fact, a substitute for “fair and equitable

treatment” for which there is no separate provision in the BIT.°® In any event, the

Respondent argues that, regardless of the interpretation given, the standard is one of due

diligence which it has clearly met.?”°

The Tribunal accepts that the MFN provision in Article 3(1) of the Sweden-Romania BIT
can bring into the relations between the Parties an obligation of full protection and security,
noting that while the Parties agree on the incorporation of the FPS obligation under Article
4(1) of the Romania-Albania BIT, they disagree over the inclusion of the obligation under

Article 3(1) of the Romania-Iran BIT and the nature of that obligation.

However, the Tribunal does not believe that it is necessary to resolve this disagreement.
The substance of the Claimants’ argument is that the failure of the Respondent to enforce
its taxation laws has deprived it of the level playing field for the operation of its spirits
production business. Whatever view the Tribunal might take of the scope of the obligation
of full protection or security, there has to be an act or omission that has denied full
protection and security. And the Tribunal has already concluded that the claim that the

Respondent has failed to enforce its tax laws has not been substantiated.

Accordingly, the claim that there has been a violation of the obligation of full protection

and security is rejected.

The Tribunal has found no breach of Article 2(3) of the Sweden-Romania BIT, nor a breach
of the provisions relating to full protection and security under the Romania-Albania BIT
and the Romania-Iran BIT which the Claimant claimed were applicable by virtue of the
MEN provision in Article 3(1) of the Sweden-Romania BIT. The Tribunal has also found
that it has no jurisdiction to consider the Mineral Water Contract claim. Accordingly, the
Tribunal has no need to address the arguments of the Claimants on whether there has been
a breach of the umbrella clause in Article 2(4) of the Sweden-Romania BIT or questions
of causation and damages. Equally, since there are no damages to be awarded, the question

whether the Micula Brothers can bring claims in their own rights is moot.

VII. COSTS

A. CLAIMANTS’ COST SUBMISSIONS

450. The Claimants request the Tribunal to order Romania to pay:

a. the costs and expenses incurred by the Claimants in connection with these

proceedings in the following amounts:

EUR 10,355,184.07;

RON 2,422,523;

iii.

GBP 23,372; and
iv. USD 6,385.

b. the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use
of the facilities of the Centre, in accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID

Convention.?7!

451. The Claimants argue that the costs that they have incurred were reasonable and should be
compensated in full, on a “costs follow the event basis.” Further, and, in any event,
regardless of the Tribunal’s findings on the merits, the Claimants argue that Romania must

be ordered to bear the costs for:

a. its “flawed and belated jurisdictional objection relating to the CJEU’s Achmea
ruling.” The Claimants state the costs incurred in respect of this objection were in

an amount of EUR 155,520.50; and

b. the entirety of costs arising from, and associated with, the Respondent’s

“unscheduled and disruptive April 2017 document production.” The Claimants

2” Cl. Cost Sub., para. 1.

state that the costs incurred in respect of this process were in the amount of EUR
128,833.70 and RON 150,000.77

B. RESPONDENT’S COST SUBMISSIONS

452. The Respondent requests that the Tribunal order the Claimants to pay:
a. compensation to the Respondent in an amount of:
i. USD 450,000;
ii. RON 18,556,915.38; and
iii. EUR 1,737,824.73; and

b. in any event, compensation to the Respondent in an amount of RON 1,442,263.23

and EUR 42,000 in relation to the Claimants’ provisional measures applications;

c. simple interest thereon at a rate of 2.91% per year, as from the date of the Award.”
453. The Respondent argues that the general principle followed in international arbitration,
including ICSID proceedings, is that the successful party is entitled to be reimbursed the

costs it has incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings.””

Cc. THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON COSTS

454. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how
and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members
of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the
Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

459.

This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including

attorney’s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.

While both Parties argue that costs should follow the event, they also argue that there are
particular circumstances in this case that justify deviating from that principle and awarding
costs that take account of the conduct of the other party that led to delay in the proceedings.
For the Claimants, the Respondent’s late request to state an additional jurisdictional
objection and its late production of documents and a supplemental expert report increased
the length of the proceedings with a consequent increase in the Claimants’ costs. For the
Respondent, the Claimants’ several requests for provisional measures and the extensions
requested for filing its Reply, as well as its position on a confidentiality regime, all

extended the life of the case and resulted in increasing the Respondent’s costs.

The Tribunal recognizes that the circumstances cited did prolong the proceedings but does
not consider that they should result in an adverse costs award against either Party. Counsel
for both Parties were representing their clients’ interests in respect all of these matters and
were entitled to do so fully. None of the circumstances raised in any way demonstrates that
there was an abuse of process or that the proceedings were affected to the disadvantage of
either party. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds no basis for taking these matters into account

in the allocation of costs.

In considering costs, the Tribunal notes that on the principal issue of liability the
Respondent prevailed. That has to be taken into account in the allocation of costs. It also
notes that the Respondent was successful in having jurisdiction denied in the claims in
respect of the Mineral Waters Contract dispute. However, notwithstanding their opposition
to the consideration of the Respondent’s Additional Preliminary Objection, the Claimants
prevailed in defending the challenge to jurisdiction on that point. That, too, is a factor to

consider in determining costs.

In respect of the costs of the arbitration — the costs of ICSID and those of the Tribunal —
the fact that the Respondent prevailed on the substantive claims suggest that the Claimants

should bear the large part of those costs. Taking account of all of the arguments made by

133

460.

461.

462.

463.

464.

the Parties in their statements of costs, the Tribunal orders that the Claimants be responsible

for 75% of the costs of the arbitration.

In respect of the costs of each party, the Tribunal notes that the costs that a party incurs
reflect the way in which that party perceives the case and how best to serve its interests in
prosecuting or defending the case. There is no objective basis on which to determine what

the costs ought to be for each party.

Taking into account the arguments of the Parties, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants
should absorb their own costs and that they should contribute to 75% of the Respondent’s

costs and the Tribunal so orders.

The Parties agree that interest should be payable on any unpaid costs award. Accordingly,
the Tribunal sets the interest rate as proposed by the Respondent as 2.91% per annum

(simple interest) reflecting the rate applied to Romanian sovereign bonds in 2018.

The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):?7>

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses

Professor McRae $230,034.30
Mr. Pryles $69,151.10

As a result, each Party’s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 431,784.97.

(7)

the Tribunal has jurisdiction over claims brought by the Claimants notwithstanding
they are brought under an intra-EU State BIT, but it does not have jurisdiction over
the Mineral Water Contract claim, since that dispute arose before the entry into force

of the Sweden-Romania BIT;

the Claimants have failed to establish that there has been a denial of fair and equitable

treatment within the meaning of Article 2(3) of the Sweden-Romania BIT;

the Claimants have failed to establish that there has been a denial of full protection
and security, even if such an obligation is incorporated in the Sweden-Romania BIT

by virtue of the MFN provision in Article 3(1);

accordingly, the claims of the Claimants in this arbitration relating to the liability of

the Respondent are dismissed;

the Claimants shall bear 75% of the costs of the arbitration and 75% of the
Respondent’s legal fees and expenses, and shall therefore to pay the Respondent
USD 215,892.49 (corresponding to 50% of the expended portion of the Respondent’s
advances to ICSID) and USD 337,500, RON 13,917,686.54, and EUR 1,303,368.55

(corresponding to 75% of the Respondent’s legal fees and expenses);

the Claimants shall pay simple interest on the amounts specified in the subparagraph
above at a rate of 2.91% per annum, payable from the date of the Award until full

payment of the Award; and

all other requests for relief are dismissed.
