UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

IN RE APPLICATION OF REPUBLIC O1
KAZAKHSTAN FOR AN ORDER
DIRECTING DISCOVERY FROM CLYDE:
& CO. LLP PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. § i OPINION & ORDER
1782

15 Misc. 0081(SHS)

 

SIDNEY H. STEIN, U.S. District Judge.

Anatolie Stati, Gabriel Stati, Ascom Group, S.A. and Terra Raf Trans
Traiding Ltd. (“intervenors” or “Stati Group”) have moved at Part I to (1)
vacate an Order issued by Judge Kimba Wood on March 30, 2015 that
granted the Republic of Kazakhstan (“ROK”) leave to obtain discovery
from the law firm of Clyde & Co. LLP pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1782 and (2)
quash the subpoena duces tecum subsequently served on Clyde & Co. LLP
pursuant to that Order.! Because the statutory prerequisites of 28 U.S.C. §
1782 have been met and discretionary factors weigh against vacating that

Order and quashing the subpoena, intervenors’ motion is denied.

I. BACKGROUND

On December 19, 2013, an arbitral tribunal in Sweden determined that
ROK had illegally seized a liquefied petroleum gas plant (“the LPG plant”)
and issued a final arbitral award in favor of the Stati Group that valued the
LPG plant at $199 million. (Decl. of Charlene Sun dated April 10, 2015 1
3, 4.) ROK then brought an action in the Svea Court of Appeal in Sweden
seeking an order setting aside the final arbitral award. (Decl. of Matthew
Kirtland dated April 21, 2015 { 8.) In its appeal, ROK challenges the award
on several grounds, including that the valuation of the LPG plant was
improperly low. (Id. at 9.) After the appeal was filed, ROK brought a

' The Stati Group has also moved to intervene pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2).
This Court granted that motion at oral argument on April 28, 2015.

petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1782 in the Southern District of New York.
In that petition, ROK sought documents from Clyde & Co. LLP, counsel to
Vitol/Vitol FSU B.V. and Arkham SA, which are parties in three other
arbitration proceedings where the valuation of the same LPG plant was
allegedly at issue. (Kirtland Decl. 11-13, 17.) ROK asserts on
information and belief that in those three arbitrations, the Stati Group had
provided a lower estimate of the value of the plant than it did in the
Swedish arbitration and that this information is relevant to ROK’s appeal
in Sweden. (Id 113; Decl. of Hans Bagner dated April 21, 2015 113.) The
Stati Group, intervening as of right in this proceeding, now moves to
vacate Judge Wood’s Order permitting discovery pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §
1782 and to quash the subpoena duces tecum served on Clyde & Co. LLP
pursuant to that Order.

At the April 28, 2015 oral argument before this Court sitting in Part I,
Clyde & Co. LLP stated that it did not oppose producing the requested

documents.
II. Discussion

A. ROK’s Petition Meets the Statutory Requirements of Section
1782

28 U.S.C. § 1782 governs under what conditions U.S. courts may
provide assistance to foreign and international tribunals and litigants
before those tribunals. The statute “affords access to discovery of evidence
in the United States for use in foreign proceedings.” In re Edelman, 295 F.3d
171, 175 (2d Cir. 2002). 28 U.S.C. § 1782 provides, in pertinent part, that,

“{t]he district court of the district in which a person resides or is found

may order him to... produce a document...for use in a proceeding in a

foreign or international tribunal...The order may be made pursuant to

a ... request made, by a foreign or international tribunal or upon the

application of any interested person...To the extent that the order does

not prescribe otherwise,... the document... [shall be] produced, in
accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”

Case 1:15-mc-00081-P1 Document 21 Filed 06/22/15 Page 3 of 9

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has identified three
requirements in section 1782 as follows,

“(1) that the person from whom discovery is sought reside (or be

found) in the district of the district court to which the application is

made, (2) that the discovery be for use in a proceeding before a foreign
tribunal, and (3) that the application be made by a foreign or
international tribunal or ‘any interested person.’ ”
Edelman, 295 F.3d at 175-76 (citing In re Esses, 101 F.3d 873, 875 (2d Cir.
1996) (per curiam)).

Each of these requirements has been met here. The Stati Group urges
that the first requirement—that the person from whom discovery is sought
must be found in the Southern District of New York—has not been
satisfied because ROK’s petition seeks discovery from “Clyde & Co. LLP,”
which is an entity headquartered in London, England, and the subpoena
was served on Clyde & Co. US LLP in New York, which is “a separate
entity.” (Mem. in Support of Motion to Vacate and Quash at 8, Dkt. No. 8.)

It is not disputed, however, that the two entities “operate as a single
law firm” and all the New York-based partners in Clyde & Co. US LLP are
also partners in Clyde & Co. LLP. (See Letter from Clyde & Co. LLP dated
April 9, 2015 94, attached as Ex. 4 to Sun Decl.) Clyde & Co. LLP’s
partners’ daily practice of law in this jurisdiction gives it the requisite
“systematic and continuous” presence to be “found” here for purposes of
section 1782. See In re Godfrey, 526 F. Supp. 2d 417, 422 (S.D.N.Y. 2007).

The Stati Group also contends that ROK’s petition does not satisfy the
third requirement —the application be made by an interested person—
because, it claims, a sovereign state is not an “interested person” pursuant
to section 1782. Several courts have found that a sovereign is not a
“person” who can be ordered to produce documents pursuant to section
1782, but those cases do not address whether a sovereign can use section
1782 to obtain discovery. See e.g., Al Fayed v. Cent. Intelligence Agency, 229
F.3d 272 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Thai-Lao Lignite (Thailand) Co., Ltd. v. Government
of Lao People’s Democratic Republic, No. 11-cv-4363, 2012 WL 966042

Case 1:15-mc-00081-P1 Document 21 Filed 06/22/15 Page 4 of 9

(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 20, 2012); McKevitt v. Mueller, 689 F. Supp. 2d 661, 668 n.1
(S.D.N.Y. 2010). In fact, in Al Fayed v. C.LA., 229 F.3d 272, 273 (D.C. Cir.
2000), the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit emphasized
this distinction. See id. (“interpreting the use of ‘person’ in § 1782 (as used
to define those subject to discovery, not those seeking discovery) to
exclude the sovereign”) (emphasis in the original); see also id. at 274 (noting
that “[n]Jo court has yet resolved whether the ‘person[s]’ subject to subpoena
in § 1782 include the federal government”) (alternation in
original)(emphasis added).

There is a “longstanding interpretive presumption that ‘person’
does not include [a] sovereign.” Vermont Agency of Natural Res. v. United
States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 780 (2000). However, the presumption is
not a “hard and fast rule of exclusion.” Id. at 781 (internal quotation marks
omitted). “The purpose, the subject matter, the context, the legislative
history, and the executive interpretation of the statute are aids to
construction which may indicate an intent, by the use of the term [person],
to bring state or nation within the scope of the law.” United States v. Cooper
Corp., 312 U.S. 600, 605 (1941).

In In re Ecuador, No. C-10-80225 2010 WL 4973492 (N.D. Cal Dec. 1,
2010), the court expressly held that sovereign states are “interested
person(s)” that can use section 1782 to obtain discovery. Id. at *1, *3. In
arriving at this conclusion, Judge Edward Chen undertook a thorough
discussion of the factors set forth in Cooper. He explained that section
1782's predecessor statutes explicitly permitted foreign states to request
judicial assistance and that the 1964 amendment that added the “interested
person” provision to section 1782 was intended to broaden rather than
narrow “the scope of those who could seek judicial assistance.” 2010 WL
4973492 at *3 (citing 1964 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at 3789). The
court also noted that courts frequently construe the word “person” not to
include a sovereign in order to avoid subjecting a sovereign to liability and
implicating concerns of sovereign immunity, none of which are at issue
here. 2010 WL 4973492 at *4.

Case 1:15-mc-00081-P1 Document 21 Filed 06/22/15 Page 5 of 9

Finally, Judge Chen found that the underlying policy of section
1782 supports allowing a sovereign to utilize the statute. One of the twin
aims of the statute is to encourage reciprocity by foreign governments. See
Schmitz v. Bernstein Liebhard & Lifshitz, LLP, 376 F.3d 79, 84 (2d Cir. 2004).
To deny foreign governments the ability to utilize this statute “is hardly
conducive to encouraging cooperation and reciprocal treatment of the
United States in the international arena.” 2010 WL 4973492 at *6. Indeed, in
the past, the Stati Group has on several occasions sought and obtained
section 1782 subpoenas for financial information concerning ROK to be
used in foreign proceedings. (See Kirtland Decl. 114). In this case,
therefore, the desire to avoid “an asymmetrical result prejudicial to foreign
governments” in order to encourage reciprocity by foreign governments
when the proverbial ball is in a foreign court is particularly apt. 2010 WL
4973492 at *6.

This Court therefore rejects the Stati Group’s contention that a
sovereign may not use section 1782 to seek discovery because it is not an
“interested person.”

The Stati Group concedes that the second requirement—that the
discovery be for use in a foreign proceeding— is met. Thus, ROK’s petition
meets the three statutory requirements of section 1782.

B. The Intel Discretionary Factors Weigh Against Granting the
Intervenors’ Motion

“Once the statutory requirements are met, a district court is free to
grant discovery in its discretion.” Schmitz, 376 F.3d at 83-84 (internal
quotations and alterations omitted). “[D]istrict courts must exercise their
discretion under § 1782 in light of the twin aims of the statute: providing
efficient means of assistance to participants in international litigation in
our federal courts and encouraging foreign countries by example to
provide similar means of assistance to our courts,” Id. at 84 (internal

quotation marks omitted).

Case 1:15-mc-00081-P1 Document 21 Filed 06/22/15 Page 6 of 9

The U.S. Supreme Court has provided guidance in the form of several
factors that “bear consideration” in ruling on a section 1782 request. See
Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., 542 U.S. 241, 264 (2004). These
factors are: (1) whether “the person from whom discovery is sought is
[not] a participant in the foreign proceeding,” which militates in favor of
granting the request; (2) “the nature of the foreign tribunal, the character
of the proceedings underway abroad, and the receptivity of the foreign
government or the court or agency abroad to U.S. federal-court judicial
assistance,” (3) “whether the § 1782(a) request conceals an attempt to
circumvent foreign proof-gathering restrictions or other policies of a
foreign country or the United States;” and (4) whether the request is
“unduly intrusive or burdensome.” Id. at 264-65.

The first factor— “whether the person from whom discovery is sought
is a participant in the foreign proceeding” — weighs in favor of ROK’s
petition and against granting the intervenors’ motion. The discovery
sought here from Clyde & Co. LLP concerns its clients, Vitol/Vitol FSU
B.V. and Arkham SA. None of these entities are parties to the foreign
action at issue.

The second factor—the nature of the tribunal, character of the
proceedings underway abroad, and the receptivity of the foreign
government to judicial assistance—and the third factor—whether the
request is an attempt to circumvent foreign proof-gathering restrictions—
also weigh in favor of the petition and against granting the intervenors’
motion. The Stati Group contends that the requested documents are
irrelevant to the Swedish proceedings because Swedish appellate review
will be limited to procedural and jurisdictional review and will not
evaluate the award’s substantive correctness. (Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to
Vacate and Quash at 11-12). In response, ROK claims that these documents
may reveal that the arbitral committee relied on falsified evidence and the
award could be therefore invalidated as manifestly incompatible with
Swedish public policy. (Mem. in Opposition to the Motion to Vacate and
Quash at 17-18). Both parties have submitted expert declarations in

Case 1:15-mc-00081-P1 Document 21 Filed 06/22/15 Page 7 of 9

support of their positions. (See Decl. of Bo Nilsson dated April 8, 2015;
Bagner Decl.)

This Court need not ascertain which party has the correct view of
Swedish law. The Second Circuit has discouraged district courts in the
context of section 1782 from “try[ing] to glean the accepted practices and
attitudes of other nations from what are likely to be conflicting and,
perhaps, biased interpretations of foreign law.” Euromepa S.A. v. R.
Esmerian, Inc., 51 F.3d 1095, 1099 (2d Cir. 1995). To require a district court
to determine such issues would involve it in a “speculative foray[ ] into
legal territories unfamiliar to federal judges.” Id. This sort of foray “would
result in an unduly expensive and time-consuming fight about foreign
law, undermining the twin aims of the statute.” In re Application for an
Order Permitting Metallgesellschaft AG to take Discovery, 121 F.3d 77, 80 (2d
Cir. 1997)(internal citation and quotation marks omitted).

Relatedly, the Stati Group has argued that the documents sought
are within the reach of the Swedish court because Ascom, one of the
members of the Stati Group and a party to one of the three arbitrations
from which ROK seeks documents, has access to “most” of the documents
requested and is subject to Swedish jurisdiction. (See Nilsson Decl. {111.)
ROK’s failure to request these documents from the Swedish tribunal,
according to the Stati Group, indicates that the Swedish tribunal would be
unlikely to compel the production of these materials and demonstrates
that ROK’s discovery request is an attempt to circumvent foreign
discovery restrictions.

There is no requirement that the party seeking discovery pursuant
to section 1782 must first request discovery from the foreign tribunal. See
Application of Malev Hungarian Airlines, 964 F.2d 97, 100 (2d Cir.
1992)(overturning the district court’s denial of section 1782 discovery
where the district court imposed a “quasi-exhaustion requirement”).
Additionally, the Second Circuit has expressly rejected a “foreign
discoverability requirement” when analyzing the Intel factors. Euromepa,
S.A. v. R. Esmerian, Inc., 154 F.3d 24, 28 (2d Cir. 1998)(“[T]he district court

Case 1:15-mc-00081-P1 Document 21 Filed 06/22/15 Page 8 of 9

need not satisfy itself that the discovery sought in the petition is of
information that would be discoverable under the laws of the foreign
jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending.”)

“A district court's inquiry into the discoverability of requested
materials should consider only authoritative proof that a foreign tribunal
would reject evidence obtained with the aid of section 1782.” Euromepa, 51
F.3d at 1099 (emphasis added)(stating also that “[w]e do not believe that
an extensive examination of foreign law regarding the existence and extent
of discovery in the forum country is desirable.”) Authoritative proof is
language in a forum country’s “judicial, executive or legislative
declarations” that “specifically address the use of evidence gathered under
foreign procedures.” Id. at 1100. No party here has presented such proof.

A receptivity inquiry here, similarly does not weigh in favor of
granting the intervenors’ motion. In Schmitz v. Bernstein Liebhard & Lifshitz,
LLP., 376 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2004), the Second Circuit found that this Court
properly denied an application for section 1782 discovery where the
German Ministry of Justice had asked it to deny the petition on the basis
that granting discovery would jeopardize “the ongoing German criminal
investigation” and “German sovereign rights.” Id. at 82, 84. This Court
found that granting discovery in the face of opposition from the foreign
tribunal would undermine the spirit and purpose of the statute by
discouraging foreign tribunals from “heeding similar sovereignty concerns
posited by our governmental authorities to foreign courts.” See In re
Schmitz, 259 F.Supp.2d 294, 298 (S.D.N.Y. 2003), aff'd 376 F.3d at 79. No
such concerns have been raised in this case.

The fourth and final factor—whether the request is overly intrusive
or burdensome—is not at issue here since neither the Stati Group nor
Clyde & Co. LLP have objected to the scope of ROK’s requests. (See
Kirtland Decl. 21).

Considering (1) the asymmetrical result prejudicial to a foreign
government that would result were this Court to find that ROK is not an
“interested person,” (2) the possibility that the requested documents could

 

Case 1:15-mc-00081-P1 Document 21 Filed 06/22/15 Page 9 of 9

reveal that the arbitral award was contrary to Swedish public policy, and
(3) the absence of authoritative proof that the Swedish tribunal would
reject this evidence, this Court concludes that denying the Stati Group’s
motion to vacate the March 30 section 1782 Order and quash the subpoena
issued pursuant to that Order promotes section 1782's aims. Indeed,
granting the motion could in fact discourage future assistance to the courts
of the United States.

III. CONCLUSION

Because the statutory prerequisites have been met and the
discretionary factors weigh in ROK’s favor, the Stati Group’s motion to (1)
vacate the March 30, 2015 Order permitting discovery pursuant to 28
U.S.C. § 1782 and (2) quash the subpoena to Clyde & Co. LLP is denied.
