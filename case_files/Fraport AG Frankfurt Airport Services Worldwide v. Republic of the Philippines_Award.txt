INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the “Agreement between
the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of the Philippines on the Promotion
and Reciprocal Protection of Investments” dated April 18, 1997 and in force since
February 1, 2000 (the “BIT” or “Treaty’), and the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into

force on October 14, 1966 (the “ICSID Convention’).

Claimant is Fraport AG Frankfurt Services Worldwide (“Fraport” or “Claimant’”), a
company incorporated in Germany. Fraport was formerly known as Flughafen Frankfurt

Main AG (“FAG”).

Respondent is the Republic of the Philippines (“The Philippines,” the “Government,” or

“Respondent”).

Claimant and Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The

Parties’ respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

OVERVIEW OF THE CASE AND PARTIES’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

The Tribunal has been charged with the daunting task of deciding a dispute which has
already been submitted to a first ICSID Tribunal, to an ICSID ad hoc Committee and
which has been the subject of a related ICC arbitration and numerous Philippine

proceedings.

This dispute centers around the invalidation of a concession to build and operate a new
international terminal (“Terminal 3”) at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila

further to the first airport privatization in Asia.!

' Cl. PHB2, para. 75.

Claimant, Fraport, is a direct and indirect investor in the concession project company,

known as the Philippines International Air Terminals Co., Inc. (“PIATCO”).

In July 1997, pursuant to a concession agreement, PIATCO was awarded, under President
Fidel V. Ramos, the Terminal 3 Concession under the Philippines’ Built-Operate-Transfer
law. In 1999, Fraport, an experienced airport operator, became an investor in PIATCO and

a “cascade” of other Philippine companies that had ownership interests in PIATCO.

Between 2001 and 2002, the relationship between PIATCO and Respondent soured for
disputed reasons, including disagreements over the renegotiation of the terms of the

concession agreement, as it will be explained in Section IV below.

In November 2002, as construction of Terminal 3 neared completion according to Fraport,
President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo announced that the Philippine Government had
determined that the concession contracts were legally invalid and would not be honored.
On May 5, 2003, the Philippine Supreme Court declared the Terminal 3 concession to be
void ab initio because the consortium behind PIATCO allegedly did not meet the financial
qualification requirements to have been awarded the concession originally, among other

reasons.

Pursuant to expropriation procedures in domestic Philippine law, a court transferred
possession of Terminal 3 to the Philippine Government in December 2004, which began
operating the Terminal in 2008. Domestic court proceedings to determine the amount of

compensation due PIATCO are still ongoing.

Fraport initiated a first ICSID case which was registered in October 2003 (ICSID Case No.
ARB/03/25) (“ICSID 1”). A Tribunal composed of Messrs. L. Yves Fortier (President),
Bernardo M. Cremades and W. Michael Reisman rendered an award on August 16, 2007
(the “ICSID 1 Award”) dismissing the case on jurisdiction, with a dissent from Dr.
Cremades. An application for annulment was lodged by Fraport and an ad hoc Committee
composed of Messrs. Peter Tomka (President), Dominique Hascher and Campbell
McLachlan rendered a decision annulling the ICSID 1 Award on December 23, 2010 (the
“ICSID Annulment Decision’).

PIATCO also initiated an ICC arbitration against Respondent in 2003, pursuant to an
arbitration clause in an amended concession agreement. On July 22, 2010, the ICC
Tribunal composed of Messrs. Michael Pryles (President), Florenz D. Regalado and V. V.
Veeder rendered a partial award dismissing PIATCO’s claims as inadmissible and

rejecting all the counterclaims presented by Respondent.

In this new arbitration proceeding, Fraport claims that it was subject to an uncompensated
and unlawful expropriation of its investment in PIATCO, along with other BIT violations

arising out of the same series of events.

The Philippines argues that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction under the BIT to hear
Fraport’s claims because Fraport’s investment violated Philippine law, and more
particularly nationality restrictions applicable to the Concession (also known as the Anti-
Dummy Law (the “ADL”)). It further argues that Fraport’s claims are inadmissible both
because of such violations, as well as corruption in obtaining and carrying out the
Concession. The Philippines admits the expropriation of Terminal 3, but argues that the
expropriation was lawful and that compensation has been paid and will continue to be paid.
It further denies any other violation of the BIT. The Philippines also counterclaims for
costs associated with the Terminal 3 Concession and amounts related to Fraport’s alleged

corruption.

Fraport responds that the Philippines’ jurisdictional and admissibility objections have no
legal basis and, moreover, are factually incorrect and unsupported. Fraport also contends
that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the Philippines’ counterclaims, which are,
nevertheless, meritless. Fraport claims that the Philippines destroyed its investment and
unlawfully expropriated by not providing prompt and adequate compensation and failed to
accord Fraport and its investment fair and equitable treatment. The Philippines is also said
to have subjected Fraport and its investments to arbitrary and discriminatory treatment and
to have violated the umbrella clause of the BIT in breaching the express terms of the

concession agreements.

Fraport’s request for relief is as follows:

Fraport requests that the Arbitral Tribunal in this case issue an award:

(a) Accepting jurisdiction of Fraport’s claims and rejecting the Philippines
objection to jurisdiction;

(b) Denying jurisdiction to the counterclaims of the Philippines;

(c) Declaring that the Philippines breached its obligations under the Germany-
Philippines BIT, Philippines laws and regulations and international law;

(d) Ordering the Philippines to pay Fraport damages with respect to all injury
caused to Fraport as a result of the Philippines’ breaches, in an amount to be
determined;

(e) Ordering the Philippines to reimburse Fraport for the costs of this
arbitration, including its legal fees and expenses, the fees and expenses of the
Tribunal and the fees of the Centre;

(f) Ordering the Philippines to pay pre-award and post-award interest at rates
to be determined; and

(g) Ordering such other relief as the Tribunal deems just and proper.”
18. The Philippines’ request for relief is as follows:

For all the reasons set forth above and in its prior submissions, Respondent
respectfully requests that the Tribunal (1) dismiss Claimant’s claims in their
entirety for lack of jurisdiction, inadmissibility, or on the merits; (2) enter a
decision in favor of Respondent in respect of all of its counterclaims; and
(3) order Claimant to bear all costs and expenses incurred by Respondent in
defending against Claimant’s claims.

19. The Tribunal will now recall the procedural history of this case and will proceed to set

forward the facts and the Parties’ positions, before examining its jurisdiction.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On March 30, 2011, ICSID received a request for arbitration of the same date submitted by
Fraport against the Republic of the Philippines, accompanied by exhibits CE-1 through
CE-23 and legal authority CA-1 (the “Request’).

On April 27, 2011, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In
the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to
constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the
Centre’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration

Proceedings.

By letters of May 12 and 26, 2011, the Parties agreed to constitute the Arbitral Tribunal in
accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention and that the Tribunal would
consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party, the third arbitrator and

President of the Tribunal to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.

The Tribunal is composed of Professor Piero Bernardini, a national of Italy, President,
appointed by agreement of the Parties on January 30, 2012; Mr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, a
national of Bulgaria, appointed by Claimant on June 23, 2011; and Professor Albert Jan

van den Berg, a national of the Netherlands, appointed by Respondent on July 27, 2011.

On February 7, 2012, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID
Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”) notified the
Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was
therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Eloise Obadia, ICSID Legal
Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. She was later replaced by

Ms. Aurélia Antonietti, ICSID Legal Counsel.

The Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on April 3, 2012, at the World Bank’s
office in Washington, D.C. The Parties confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had

been validly appointed. It was agreed inter alia that the applicable Arbitration Rules

26.

27.

28.

29.

would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural language would be
English and that the place of proceeding would be Washington, D.C. The decisions of the
Tribunal and the agreement of the Parties were embodied in the Minutes of the First
Session signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal and circulated to the

Parties on April 17, 2012.

At the Session, it was decided that, considering the factual background of this case, it was
appropriate to address issues of jurisdiction and liability in a first phase, followed by a

second phase on issues relating to quantum, if needed.*

At the Session, it was also decided that the Tribunal would first examine threshold
procedural matters (the “Preliminary Phase’) raised by Respondent on March 28 and 29,
2012, and that a schedule for further procedures would be fixed once the Tribunal would

have decided on the aforementioned matters.

By letter dated April 4, 2012, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit observations on
two points relating to the Preliminary Phase matters as specified during the First Session,”
namely whether and to what extent findings of fact and conclusions of law of the ICSID 1
Award were binding, and whether and to what extent the evidentiary record of the ICSID 1
proceedings and the ICC related proceedings were to be incorporated into these

proceedings.

In accordance with the schedule set forth by the Tribunal, the Parties submitted their
respective observations. Respondent’s submission dated April 18, 2012, was accompanied
by exhibits RE-1 through RE-102, legal authorities RL-1 through RL-75, Annexes A
through D (Legal Opinion of Professor Dr. Rudolf Dolzer dated April 18, 2012 (Annex A),
and Legal Opinion of Professor Christoph Schreuer dated April 12, 2012 (Annex B)),
while Claimant’s submission dated May 2, 2012, was accompanied by exhibits CE-24
through CE-35, legal authorities CA-2 through CA-42, and by a Declaration of Professor
Andreas F. Lowenfeld dated May 1, 2012.

+ Minutes of the First Session, para. 13.3.

> Minutes of the First Session, paras. 13.1.1 and 13.1.2.

30. On May 17, 2012, having considered the Parties’ respective submissions, the Tribunal
issued Procedural Order No. | whereby (i) it found that the ICSID 1 Award had been
annulled in its entirety by the ad hoc Committee, (ii) it denied Respondent’s requests to
consider certain determinations of the ICSID 1 Tribunal and the ICC Tribunal binding on
the Parties, and (iii) it admitted the records of the ICSID 1 proceedings and the ICC
proceedings into the present record.® The Tribunal also fixed a schedule for further

procedures, including a date for a hearing.

31. On August 17, 2012, Claimant filed its Memorial on Liability (“Mem.”), accompanied by
exhibits CE-36 through CE-150, legal authorities CA-43 through CA-104, and the

following supporting documents:

Witness Statements:

2)”).

© Documents from the record of ICSID | that are referred to in this arbitration are designated “ICSID-document
number” pursuant to a Master Index agreed upon by the Parties, and those from the ICC record, “ICC-document
number.” For ease of reference and to the extent possible, the Tribunal will refer in this Award to the exhibit
numbers used in the Parties’ Core Bundle prepared for the September 2013 Hearing, “CBII-document number.”

’ The Parties have not adopted a common naming guide for the witness statements and expert reports. The names
indicated in quote under each memorial in this section are the one used by each party. Statements previously filed
in ICSID 1 have also been referred to and provided by the Parties. Claimant has not used consistent abbreviations
throughout its pleadings and has provided the ICSID | statements and reports electronically. Respondent has
used consistent abbreviations and provided ICSID 1 or ICC statements and reports under RE#. As a
consequence, the Tribunal has adopted its own naming guide which indicates which statements and reports were
filed in these proceedings as ICSID 2, by contrast to some statements, opinions and reports filed in ICSID 1.
Witness statements and expert reports from the record of ICSID | that are referred to in this arbitration are named
“last name of witness/expert/name of organization (ICSID 1),” and those introduced in this arbitration, “last name
of witness/expert/name of organization (ICSID 2).”

On August 5, 2013, and in accordance with paragraph 15.9 of the Minutes of the First
Session, each Party exchanged a list of witnesses and experts it wished to cross-examine at
the hearing. Claimant’s and Respondent’s lists of witnesses and experts were submitted to

the ICSID Secretariat on August 12, 2014 and August 14, 2014 respectively.

Pursuant to paragraph 15.9 of the Minutes of the First Session, each Party could request the
Tribunal to be allowed to designate up to 3 of its own witnesses or experts for direct
testimony, indicating the scope and questions of the direct testimony, regardless of whether

such individual has been called for cross-examination by the other Party. By letter of

Al.

42.

43.

August 12, 2013, Fraport requested to hear Messrs. Peter Henkel, Mike Jackson (URS) and
Dietrich Stiller. By letter of August 13, 2013, Respondent requested to hear Messrs.
Norbert Lésch and Venner Mendoza. Respondent also requested to call two rebuttal
experts for direct testimony (to rebut new analysis by Claimant in its Sur-Rejoinder),
namely Messrs. Mark Pieth and Brent Kaczmarek. Claimant objected to this last request

on August 15, 2013, and Respondent answered on August 16, 2013.

By letter of August 19, 2013, the Tribunal extended until August 26, 2013, the deadline
provided under paragraph 15.9 of the Minutes of the First Session to determine the
witnesses and experts who were to appear at the hearing. By the same letter, the Parties

were invited to submit simultaneous Skeleton Submissions by September 3, 2013.

On August 20, 2013, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the
Parties by telephone conference to discuss the forthcoming hearing and its logistics. The
decisions of the Tribunal and the agreement of the Parties were embodied in the Minutes of
the Pre-Hearing Organizational Meeting signed by the President and the Secretary of the

Tribunal and circulated to the Parties on August 22, 2013.°

Following several rounds of Parties’ correspondence on each other’s designation of
witnesses and experts who were to be made available at the hearing and the scope of the
direct testimony, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 on September 2, 2013, by
which it determined the list of witnesses and experts to be made available for cross-
examination and direct examination at the hearing. The Tribunal allowed the Parties’
requests to call Messrs. Peter Henkel, Mike Jackson (URS), Dietrich Stiller, Norbert Lésch
and Venner Mendoza for direct testimony, listing the scope and questions of their direct
testimonies. The Tribunal allowed the direct supplemental testimony of Messrs. Mark
Pieth and Brent Kaczmarek on the condition that a written rebuttal be submitted a week
before the hearing, and upon the condition that their direct examination remain within the

scope of their reports and subject to Claimant’s right to cross-examine them.

° See also letter from the Secretary to the Parties, Aug. 30, 2013.

Further to disagreements between the Parties on September 5 and 6, 2013 as to the
availability of some witnesses and experts and their rolling order, as well as Respondent’s
request to use video-conference for the cross-examination of some its witnesses, the
Tribunal ordered the Parties on September 6, 2013, to confer and endeavor to agree on the
schedule by September 9, 2013, and denied any examination by video at that late stage,
except for Ms. De Lima and Mr. De Ocampo, for whom Claimant had not objected
provided that Respondent paid for the costs of Claimant’s counsel to travel to Manila and

attend the examination in the video-conference room.

Following the submission of Claimant’s Sur-Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the Parties filed

several requests to admit new documents into the record:

- By letter of August 16, 2013, Respondent requested leave to submit 27 new
documents to rebut new evidence and new arguments alleged asserted by
Claimant in its Sur-Rejoinder. By letter of August 21, 2013, Claimant
objected to Respondent’s request. By letter of August 23, 2013, the Tribunal
granted Respondent leave to submit the said new documents, namely
exhibits RE-2045 through RE-2071, submitted on August 31, 2013, subject

to Claimant’s opportunity to submit documents in response.

- By letter of August 29, 2013, Claimant requested leave to admit into the
record (and produced) 5 newly received letters from Credit Suisse and BNP
Paribas, regarding the ownership of bank accounts by Messrs. Endler and
Struck, that were proposed to stand in lieu of Messrs. Endler and Struck’s
cross-examinations. Respondent objected to that suggestion on September
1, 2013. In its Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal admitted in the record
Claimant’s letters (exhibit CE-372), and confirmed that the witnesses were

to be heard at the hearing.

- By letter of August 29, 2013, Respondent requested leave to introduce 5 new
documents containing updates on related Philippine proceedings, which
Claimant commented by email of September 1, 2013. By cover letter of

September 2, 2013, to Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal partially granted

46.

47.

48.

Respondent’s request. Respondent submitted into the record exhibits
RE-2072 through RE-2075 on September 3, 2013, and exhibits RE-2076 and
RE-2077 on September 4, 2013.

- Claimant submitted exhibits CE-307 through CE-333 on September 6, 2013
responsive to (i) the documents that Respondent introduced further to its
letter of August 29, 2013, and (ii) the 27 new documents submitted by
Respondent on August 31, 2013.

On September 3, 2013, the Parties filed their respective Skeleton Submissions (“CI/R.
Skeleton”).

On September 9, 2013, Respondent submitted written rebuttal reports of Messrs. Brent
Kaczmarek and Mark Pieth, as provided by the Tribunal’s letter of August 30, 2013, and
Procedural Order No. 3. Respondent’s submission was accompanied by Respondent’s

exhibits RE-2078 through RE-2093.

Claimant objected to these reports on September 10, 2013, and reiterated its request that
the direct testimony of those experts be rejected, which prompted a series of exchange of
letters between the Parties. Intensive correspondence was also exchanged between the
Parties regarding the schedule of the hearing. By letter of September 12, 2013, the
Tribunal rejected Claimant’s request of September 10, 2013, and allowed Messrs. Pieth
and Kaczmarek’s testimony. The Tribunal also settled the sequence of the Parties’
presentations, fixed dates for the examination of some witnesses, and took note of
Respondent’s decision not to call Messrs. Lésch and Villaraza. Given that Mr. Lésch had
not been called by Claimant for cross-examination, the Tribunal indicated that it would
evaluate Mr. Lésch’s statements submitted in this proceeding and the testimony given in
the previous ICSID and the ICC proceedings and would assign to that testimony such
evidentiary weight as it deems appropriate under the circumstances. By contrast,
Mr. Villaraza had been called by Claimant for cross-examination and Respondent did not
provide justified reasons for its request to hear him by video-conference. The Tribunal
decided therefore to disregard his testimony in accordance with paragraph 15.10 of the

Minutes of the First Session.

49.

50.

By letter of September 15, 2013, Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to
introduce into the record 30 new documents. Pursuant to the Parties’ agreement and the
Tribunal’s leave granted on the first day of the hearing, Respondent submitted exhibits

RE-2094 through RE-2123 into the record on September 17, 2013.

A hearing on jurisdiction, liability and counterclaims took place in Washington, D.C. from
September 16 through 26, 2013 (the “Hearing”). In addition to the Members of the
Tribunal, the Secretary of the Tribunal, and ICSID paralegal, Ms. Angela Ting, present at

On September 27, 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 providing the
subsequent procedural steps, including a schedule for the Parties to submit the slides used
during the Hearing (with “limited and only necessary (marked-up) corrections to their

slides”'°

permitted), for the revisions to the Hearing transcripts, for post-hearing briefs and
submissions on costs. Specific steps were taken for the production of documents expressly
relied upon during direct and cross examinations, which had not been exchanged between
the Parties and were not yet part of the record, as well as for documents exchanged
between the Parties in view of direct and cross examinations but not expressly relied upon
during those examinations and which were to be introduced into the record only upon
leave granted by the Tribunal to be requested within 2 weeks after the finalization of the
transcripts. In addition, the Parties were requested to submit together with their post-
hearing briefs a list of “every question submitted to the Tribunal” within the meaning of
Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention. For each question, reference was to be given to
the relevant part of the written and oral pleadings as well as exhibits and witness

statements and experts’ reports.

On October 4, 2013, the Parties submitted the electronic version of their respective slides

used during the Hearing.

By letters dated October 11, 2013, Respondent alleged that Claimant made modifications
to its slides in violation of paragraph 2(a) of the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 4.
Claimant presented similar allegations by letter dated October 12, 2013, in which it also
commented on Respondent’s allegations. On October 14, 2013, Respondent provided its
response to Claimant’s letter of October 12, 2013, to which Claimant replied by letter
dated October 15, 2013. By email of the same date, Respondent reiterated its position

against Claimant’s assertions.

59.

Having considered the Parties’ respective positions, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order
No. 5 on October 24, 2013, by which it decided to retain the slides as submitted by each
Party, (i) keeping in mind the Parties’ respective observations on record, (ii) taking into
account that the Tribunal had at its disposal the original hard copy of the slides provided
by the Parties at the Hearing, also on record, and (iii) having regard to the forthcoming
post-hearing briefs in which each Party were allowed to comment on the alleged additions

by the other Party in its slides.

By email dated November 26, 2013, Respondent informed the Centre that the Parties were
still conferring on the proposed revisions to the Hearing transcripts in the hopes of
reaching an agreement. On November 27, 2013, Claimant submitted on behalf of both
Parties a joint errata sheet identifying the proposed revisions to the Hearing transcripts on
which the Parties agreed and disagreed. The Parties submitted later that day their
respective reasoning for their objections to the disputed proposed revisions to the Hearing

transcripts.

By letter dated December 4, 2013, Claimant requested leave from the Tribunal to introduce
into the record letters from IBIS Capital LP, Credit Suisse S.A. and BNP Paribas
responding to a release letter by Mr. Struck, the production of which had not been objected
to by Respondent during the Hearing. On December 5, 2013, Claimant submitted these

letters into the record (exhibit CE-373) further to the Tribunal’s decision granting leave.

By letter dated December 8, 2013, Respondent submitted on behalf of both Parties an
updated version of the Hearing transcripts reflecting the Parties’ proposed revisions, along
with a corrected joint errata sheet identifying the Parties’ proposed revisions to the Hearing
transcripts. By letter dated December 11, 2013, Respondent submitted on behalf of both

Parties a further corrected joint errata sheet.

On December 16, 2013, finalized Hearing transcripts incorporating the Parties’ proposed
revisions on which the Parties agreed, and the Tribunal’s decision on the Parties’ disputed

proposed revisions, were circulated to the Parties.

Further to the finalization of the Hearing transcripts, the Tribunal determined that the
starting date for the remaining schedule set forth in the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 4
would be January 2, 2014, having considered the Parties’ respective response of December

16, 2013 to the Secretary.

As scheduled, the Parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs on March 3, 2014 (“CL/R.
PHB1”), and simultaneous reply post-hearing briefs on April 2, 2014 (“CI./R. PHB2”).

The Parties filed simultaneous submissions on costs on May 2, 2014, and simultaneous

reply submissions on costs on May 19, 2014.

Following the completion of the Hearing, the Parties also filed several requests to admit

new documents into the record:

- By letters of January 17, 2014, the Parties respectively requested leave from
the Tribunal to introduce into the record additional documents in accordance
with paragraph 4 of Procedural Order No. 4. In its letter, Respondent further
requested leave from the Tribunal to introduce into the record “copies of
brief, motions, and decisions filed from October onward in the Philippine

just compensation proceedings.” |!

As directed by the Tribunal, Claimant
filed its observations on Respondent’s further request by letter dated January
22, 2014. By letter dated January 24, 2014, Respondent submitted
unsolicited comments. By letter of the same date, the Tribunal granted the
Parties leave to introduce the additional documents into the record, namely
Claimant’s exhibits CE-334 through CE-373 and legal authorities CA-180
and CA-181, and Respondent’s exhibits RE-2123 through RE-2139,
respectively submitted by the Parties on January 17, 2013, and denied

Respondent’s further request.

- By letter of February 13, 2014, Respondent requested leave from the

Tribunal to introduce into the record (i) documents relating to the

' Respondent's letter, Jan. 17, 2014.

States, (ii) a cover letter attached to the Draft Memorandum from Clifford
Chance to Fraport dated September 6, 2006 (CBII-309) and (iii) the ICSID
Brown Book. By letter dated February 17, 2014, the Tribunal granted the
Respondent’s leave to introduce into the record these documents, namely

Respondent’s exhibits RE-2140 and RE-2141 and legal authority RL-508.

By letter of March 12, 2014, Claimant requested leave from the Tribunal to
introduce into the record three documents relating to new developments in
the Philippine court. By letters dated March 17, 2014, Respondent
submitted its observations, including its request to be permitted to introduce
into the record its own additional documents were the Tribunal to grant
Claimant’s request. As directed by the Tribunal, Respondent provided
further observations by letter dated March 19, 2014. By letter dated March
20, 2014, the Tribunal decided to grant the Parties leave to submit their

Henry Go (G.R. No. 168539). On April 21, 2014, Claimant provided its
observations. On April 22, 2014, the Tribunal decided to grant Respondent
leave to introduce into the record the aforementioned decision, namely

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The Tribunal needs to set out the factual matrix of this case as it arises from the evidence,
written and oral, presented by the Parties and to review the history of Fraport’s investment
in the Terminal 3 Project. To do so, it will adopt a chronological timeline when possible,
taking into consideration that the Parties are in disagreement over important facts. To the
extent relevant or useful, some facts will be discussed in more detail in the Tribunal’s

analysis of the disputed issues.

A. The NAIA Terminal 3 Project and the Concession Agreements

In the early 1990s, the Philippine Government under President Fidel V. Ramos decided to
establish a new international passenger terminal (“Terminal 3”) at Ninoy Aquino
International Airport (“NAIA”), using procedures provided in the 1994 Philippines’ Built-
Operate-Transfer (“BOT”) law. R

NAIA Terminal 1 had been built in 1981 and handled domestic flights of carriers other
than the Philippines Airlines (“PAL”). Terminal 2 had opened in 1999 and was devoted to

” CBII-12, 1994 BOT law.

domestic flights and PAL’s domestic and international flights. The new Terminal 3 was
supposed to exclusively handle international flights, while Terminals 1 and 2 would be

closed to international flights from the date Terminal 3 was to enter into service.

The successful bidder was to have the sole and exclusive responsibility to finance,
construct, manage and operate Terminal 3, and was supposed to transfer the Terminal to
the Government at the end of a concession period of 25 years. The successful bidder was

to generate revenue from public and non-public revenues in line with airport practices.

The 1994 BOT law allowed “unsolicited” proposals from private entities (i.e., not solicited
by the Government), provided that such proposals could only be accepted if they did not
create financial exposure for the Government. 'S Under the BOT law, unsolicited proposals
must meet financial, technical, and legal prequalification requirements. Prior to final
approval of an unsolicited proposal, the Government must solicit competing proposals
from other bidders to complete the Project at a lower price, although the original proposer
was given the right to match any competing bid within 30 days (also known as the “Swiss

Challenge’). 4

The pre-bidding and bidding process was overseen by the Pre-qualification, Bids and
Awards Committee (“PBAC”), an agency of the Department of Transportation and
Communications (“DOTC”), in charge of applying the 1994 Implementing Rules and
Regulations! (“IRR”) of the BOT law. The approval of the Project was of the jurisdiction
of the National Economic Development Authority (“NEDA”), chaired by the President of
the Philippines, and its Investment Coordination Committee (“ICC”), run by the ICC

Cabinet Committee (“ICC-CC”) chaired by the Secretary of Finance.

71. For unsolicited proposals, Section 11.4 of the IRR provides that an unsolicited proposal
“shall be submitted to the ICC '® only upon official endorsement by the Head of the
concerned Agency [...]. ICC shall approve the project scope in accordance with the
guidelines” attached as Annex B to the IRR. Regarding the contract approval for
unsolicited proposals, Section 12.1 of the IRR provides that the contract shall be approved
by the Head of the concerned Agency subject to various conditions, one of which being
“clearance from the ICC on a no-objection basis pursuant to section 9.2.” Section 9.2 of

the IRR entitled “ICC clearance” provides:

SECTION 9.2 ICC Clearance. - In case of projects involving substantial
government undertakings as defined under the ICC guidelines hereto attached
as Annex B, the concerned Agency/LGU shall, prior to the approval of the
Notice of Awards, submit the draft contract to the ICC for clearance on a no-
objection basis, specifically on the extent of the final government undertaking
to be provided to the project, if any, within seven (7) calendar days from the
date the decision to award the contract is made. If the draft contract includes
government undertakings within the scope of an earlier ICC approval, then the
submission will only be for the information of the ICC. However, should it
include additional provisions or provisions different from the original scope of
government undertakings, then the draft contract will have to be reviewed by
the ICC. In which case, the ICC shall act on the final draft contract within
fifteen (15) working days upon submission of complete documentation.
Unless otherwise previously notified in writing by the ICC, failure to act
within this prescribed period shall mean that the concerned Agency/LGU may
proceed with contract award. The concerned Head of Agency/LGU shall
approve the Notice of Award within seven (7) calendar days from the date the
clearance by the ICC on a no-objection basis for the contract has been
received. The Notice of Award shall then be issued within seven (7) calendar
days from the approval thereof.

Annex B of the IRR is entitled “ICC Guidelines for the Review of Projects Proposed to be

Financed under the Various Private Sector Investment (PSI) Schemes.”

72. The Parties disagree as to the specific approval process to be followed for a concession

contract. For Claimant, after approval of the project by PBAC, it was bided out with a

'© ICC being defined as “the Investment Coordination Committee of the National Economic Development
Authority (NEDA) Board,” 1994 IRR, Section 1.3(k) (CBII-13).

draft contract. The ICC clearance of the draft contract is on a no objections basis’ and it
suffices to constitute the approval of the contract since contracts and drafts contracts are of
the sole responsibility of the ICC under Section 9.2 of the 1994 IRR. For Respondent,
once the ICC clearance is secured, the project needs to be elevated to the NEDA Board for
approval with the issuance of a NEDA Board resolution pursuant to Section IV.1.d of
Annex B-2 to the IRR.'* Any condition reflected in such a resolution must be the basis for
loans negotiations, the compliance of which is monitored and reported to the ICC. ° In any
event, Respondent argues, if the contract includes additional provisions or provisions
different from the original in a range of 10% of costs increase, then the draft contract has to

be reviewed by the Icc.”

73. As it will be explained below, the Parties disagree as to whether certain key agreements in

this case have been actually approved.”!

Technical Board and Cabinet Committee for clearance. [...] Once an ICC clearance has been secured, the
project is elevated to the NEDA Board for approval, with the issuance of a NEDA Board Resolution. Exception
to this, however, include projects involving foreign borrowings below the prescribed cut-off level as well as
program/policy and sector loans incurred strictly for BOP/budgetary support which would no longer undergo ICC
review. Rather, these projects can be referred directly to the NEDA Board for approval as may be endorsed by
the ICC Secretariat, copy furnished ICC for notation/monitoring purposes.”

The Tribunal notes that under Section 2, definition (d) BOT of the BOT law, the approval of the President of the
Philippines seems needed, see CBII-12. It further notes that the approval of the President of the Philippines was
deemed not to be necessary for the concession agreement in this case by the ICC-Technical Working Group (see
CBII-39, Summary of ICC-TWG review discussions, items 3 and 18) subject to clarification in the NEDA Board
Resolution.

Bank, property, brewery and tobacco enterprises. He then owned PAL and MacroAsia, a concessionaire which

Filipino-Chinese businessmen (all known as the “Taipans”) — made an “unsolicited” BOT

proposal to establish and operate the new international terminal at NAIA.?>

75. In September 1995, AEDC made a revised BOT proposal for both Terminal 3 and the
planned Clark International Airport (outside of Manila), which was approved under certain
conditions by the NEDA Board in February 13, 1996.4 The DOTC then solicited

competing proposals, as required by the BOT law.?°

76. On September 3, 1996, the PAIRCARGO Consortium (consisting of 3 Philippine
companies: PAIRCARGO,”° Philippines Airport and Ground Services, Inc. (“PAGS”), and
Security Bank, a Philippine commercial bank) applied to PBAC to be exempted from
minimum equity requirements; this request was denied. Nevertheless, the PAIRCARGO
consortium was allowed to show that the consortium members — rather than the entity that

would be incorporated to undertake the Terminal 3 Project, i.e, PIATCO — had the
required capital.””

77. On September 19, 1996, the PAIRCARGO Consortium put forward a bid for the Terminal
3 Project”® that, according to Fraport, would include significantly higher payments to the

Government than the AEDC bid would.” The PAIRCARGO Consortium was prequalified

controls much of the ground handling, catering and other operations at NAIA, and which was said to loose
substantial revenues if it did not dominate the airside services at Terminal 3 (Cl. PHB1, paras. 70-71). Mr. Tan
also allegedly controlled MASO with Ricky Delgado (the MIA-NAIA Association of Service Operators)
incorporated in mid-2001, which is said to have engaged in aggressive campaigns against Fraport and PIATCO
(Cl. Skeleton, p. 13; Cl. PHB1, para. 72).

knowledge of his involvement at the time of its investment (R. PHB2, para. 69). In addition, Respondent

by PBAC to bid for the Project on September 26, 1996. *° In October 1996, PBAC
declared that the technical proposal was complying with the technical requirements of the
Bid,*! and complying with the Bid Documents for the purpose of matching the price

challenge.” AEDC had 30 days to match the price challenge.

According to Fraport,*? and this does not seem to be disputed, the Taipans never submitted
a bid to match the PAIRCARGO’s bid. AEDC objected however that the PAIRCARGO
Consortium’s bid did not have sufficient capital to meet the pre-qualification requirement,
and that by law only 15% of the net worth of Security Bank, rather than 100%, should be
counted towards the PAIRCARGO Consortium’s minimum equity. 34 AEDC also

requested a copy of the proposal. PBAC rejected the challenge.*°

On February 17, 1997, PIATCO was incorporated by PAIRCARGO, PAGS, and SB
Capital Investment Corp. (the last of which is authorized to act on behalf of Security
Bank), but not by Security Bank itself.°° PIATCO’s original president was Cheng Yong,
later replaced by Henry T. Go.

The circumstances surrounding the finalization of the Concession Agreement are highly
disputed among the Parties together with the question of whether the Concession

Agreement was approved by the appropriate body.

fraud, with exorbitant payments by PIATCO for no legitimate purpose (R. PHB1, paras. 66-74) and through
financial and technical misrepresentations (R. PHB1, paras. 107-118). Respondent also submits that Security
Bank and PIATCO had direct connection to President Estrada (R. PHB2, para. 54).

and would finance the Project alongside other lenders (R. PHB2, para. 67).

81. On April 15, 1997, the ICC Technical Working Group met to review the final draft
concession agreement and “recommend[ed] the notation of the BOT contract subject to

DOTC’s consideration of points” attached in a separate summary document.*”

82. On April 16, 1997, the NEDA Deputy Director General/Technical Board Chairman, Dante
Calans, wrote to the 9 members of the ICC “for [their] decision on the final draft project
agreement.” Attaching the draft contract and the ICC Technical Working Group summary,
he wrote “[t]o facilitate the ICC processing of the project, we would appreciate receiving

the accomplished ad referendum*® signature sheet” by April 16, 1997.”

83. The ICC Minutes dated April 17, 1997, indicate as follows under the heading “VI Other
Matters,” “NAIA Terminal 3 International Passenger Terminal BOT Project”:

The ICC conducted an ad referendum to facilitate the approval, on a no
objections basis, of the BIT agreement between DOTC and PIATCO. The ad
referendum was able to gather four signatures - OP, CCAP, BSP and NEDA.
Ad referendum approval requires six signatures.

Action taken:

The ICC noted the BOT agreement.”

84. The Parties are in agreement that the Project of Terminal 3, at the time upon AEDC’s
proposal, was approved by a NEDA Board resolution on February 13, 1996. However
they disagree as whether a subsequent NEDA Board resolution was needed for the actual

award of the Concession Agreement.

ICC Members for decision on the final draft project agreement, Apr. 16, 1997 (emphasis added). For Claimant,
the word “notation” used by the Technical Working Group is no different than the word “approval” (Hr. Tr. Day
5, 1069).

85. Fraport submits that the ICC did approve the agreement,"! while Respondent submits that
it was not approved but merely noted.” This specific point was argued by both Parties at
the Hearing (day 3 and 5) in response to the Tribunal’s questions. A similar discussion

arose between the Parties regarding the approval of the ARCA (see infra).

86. AEDC was denied in May 1997 a preliminary injunction against the DOTC for awarding
the Project to PIATCO.** A Memorandum from the Chief Legal Counsel to the President

+! Mem., para. 167, referring to a letter from NEDA to DOTC of July 6, 1999 (CBII-84), whereby it is mentioned
that “the ICC-NEDA likewise approved the BOT contract.” Fraport relies on NEDA Board Resolution No. 2
from 1996 (CBII-16) which indicates that the project was “unanimously approved” on Feb. 13, 1996. Fraport
questions the requirement for 6 signatures under the IRR, highlighting that it was a no-objections basis process
and that it is not a legal requirement but a tradition (Cl. PHB1, para. 25). Fraport is anyhow relying on the 2002
statement by former NEDA Director Canlas before the Blue Ribbon Committee (ICSID-272-CM4761) which
indicated having collected 4 signatures and received 3 more subsequently (Trade & Industry, Agriculture and
Energy), not reflected in the Apr. 1997 ICC Minutes. CBII-39 shows 7 signatures. In addition, Fraport relies on
Acting Secretary of Justice Gutierrez’s Nov. 28, 2002, Memorandum to Secretary Rémulo stating that the
concession agreement was approved (CBII-338) and to her testimony in the first ICSID arbitration (ICSID 1, Hr.
Tr. 1908.15). In any event, Fraport refers to a Memorandum from President Estrada of Feb. 12, 1999 (CBII-60)
mentioning that the Government “has committed to the fulfilment of all its obligation under the Concession
Agreement dated July 12, 1997 (as amended and restated on Nov. 26, 1998).” Claimant further points out that the
ARCA supplanted the Concession Agreement and that “any issue of approval, therefore, would have been cured
with the approval of the ARCA” (CL. Slide 19, Hr. Day 3).

See also Cl. Slides, Hr. Day 3 and 5, Sept. 18 and 20, 2013; Hr. Tr. Day 5, 1057-1078.

 

*” C-Mem., para. 129, indicating at fn. 261 “The ICC Secretariat by tradition requires that in instances when
action must be performed in the absence of physical presence, any voting by ad referendum must produce at least
a minimum of votes representing a quorum, i.e., fifty percent (50%) of the members of the ICC Cabinet
Committee, plus one, which means six votes, De Ocampo (ICSID) (RE-116) J 33.” For Respondent, the BOT
agreement was noted because it only had received 4 signatures. According to Respondent, as indicated in CBII-
39, PIATCO’s Bid security was to expire on Apr. 19, 1997, and the ICC-NEDA Committee was asked to expedite
its review. Respondent relies on Secretary De Ocampo statement (RE-116, para. 25) according to whom the
NEDA Board’s approval of Feb. 13, 1996 (CBII-16) was subject to inter alia the condition that the Terminal 3
and Clark airport be simultaneously developed (which Claimant objects to as the Clark development was not to
occur before a certain passenger level for 3 years) (Hr. Tr. Day 7, 1737, CBII-17-Bid documents), as well as other
conditions. According to Secretary De Ocampo, no other additional signatures were received during his service
as Chair of the NEDA-ICC until early 1998 (CBH-311, ICC Hr. Tr. Mar. 9, 2009, 1082-1083). Respondent
argues that there were only 4 signatures until 2002 and 3 faxed undated and illegible signatures as of Jan. 2003
(ICSID-01226) and that Canlas claimed for the first time before the Blue Ribbon Committee in Dec. 2002 that the
additional signatures existed and that he was contradicted by NEDA and its then Deputy Director General,
Mr. Lotilla. Respondent also uses statements made before the Blue Ribbon Committee to submit that the original
Concession Agreement had only be noted, and not approved. In any event, Respondent submits that there was no
NEDA Board resolution approving the Concession Agreement.

Ramos advised on July 10, 1997, to proceed without delay in implementing the awarding

of the Project to PLATCO.*

Mid-July 1997, the DOTC issued the official Notice of Award in favor of PIATCO.** On
July 12, 1997, the Terminal 3 Concession Agreement “6 was, signed by PIATCO, the
Secretary of the DOTC, and the head of the Manila airport authority (“MIAA”).

The Concession Agreement provided that PLATCO was to finance, construct, and operate
the Terminal 3 for 25 years. Terminal 3 was to be the only international terminal at NAIA
and duty free operations were to be located there, which Fraport insists was a key aspect of

the Terminal 3 Project.*”
On July 14, 1997, PIATCO Shareholders entered into a Shareholders’ Agreement.**

MIAA issued on July 14, 1997, PIATCO with a Notice to Commence Work for the

Project.”
In June 1998, President Joseph Estrada succeeded President Ramos.

AEDC’s challenge: As previously mentioned, between April 1997 and April 1999, AEDC
sued the DOTC over the PIATCO Concession, re-asserting inter alia that PLATCO was not

financially prequalified.

On the same day that the Concession Agreement, on July 12, 1997, an agreement between
the Philippines, MIAA and PIATCO was entered into to consider AEDC’s civil case and

giving PIATCO the opportunity to terminate the Concession Agreement if the civil case

was unfavorably resolved by June 30, 1998.°° On May 20, 1998, this agreement was
modified to give additional time until June 30, 1999, to the Philippines “to reach a

resolution of the Civil Case or to sufficiently defend its position therein.”*!

According to Claimant, the Government defended the suit, arguing that the standards for
financial prequalification had been applied correctly. 2 Ultimately, AEDC and the

Solicitor General requested a joint motion to dismiss granted in April 1999.3

The ARCA: On November 26, 1998, the Amended and Restated Concession Agreement
(the “ARCA”) was signed by PIATCO and the head of DOTC/MIAA.** The ARCA
clarified certain commitments and obligations at the request of foreign lenders, which
required some changes prior to committing, and included a warranty on the part of the
Philippines as to the legality and validity of the ARCA and the procedures under which it

was entered into.”

Section 4.04(c) of the ARCA gave the external project financiers (the “Senior Lenders,”
i.e. a consortium made of Kreditanstalt fiir Wiederaufbau (KfW), the Asian Development
Bank, and the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation) the option — in case of
default by PIATCO — to designate a qualified nominee to operate the Terminal or to
transfer it. Failing to find a nominee within certain time period, the Terminal was to be

transferred to the Government upon payment of a “termination payment” to PIATCO.

97. The Parties disagree as to whether the ARCA was properly approved and as to whether

Section 4.04(c) contains a Government guarantee, in breach of the IRR.

98. On February 12, 1999, President Estrada issued a memorandum to Government agencies
“affirming the government’s commitment to extend full assistance” to the Terminal 3
Project, acknowledging the Philippines’s obligations under the Concession Agreement and

the ARCA and ordering the agencies to provide full cooperation to complete the Project.*”

°° For Claimant, the ARCA and its supplements are merely a revision of the 1997 agreement and were negotiated
contracts under the IRR which could be freely modified by the parties (ICSID-1058, Sison II (ICSID 1), paras.
65-66). Claimant submits that the ARCA was approved on June 25, 1999, by the NEDA ICC-CC (CBII-78). The
only item subject to approval and monitoring was the credit agreement between PIATCO and the Senior Lenders,
and this is “not a ‘conditional approval’ but an approval that incorporates a future requirement” (Slide 16, Hr.
Day 3; Cl. PHB1, para. 29). On Aug. 19, 1999, the NEDA Board approved the ARCA (CBII-89), referred to in a
2002 Climaco Memorandum (CBII-317, p. 3). The ARCA approval was confirmed by NEDA itself in
subsequent letter dated July 6, 1999, prior to Fraport’s first equity investment (CBII-84). Canlas testified before
the Senate Committee of Transportation and Communication in May 2002 that the ARCA had been approved by
the NEDA Board (ICSID-1186, CRM1135). In addition, Fraport relies on Acting Secretary of Justice Gutierrez’s
Nov. 28, 2002, Memorandum to Secretary Rémulo stating that the ARCA was approved by the ICC (CBII-338)
(see Cl. Slides, Hr. Day 3 and 5 on Tribunal Questions, Sept. 18 and 20, 2013). Claimant also objects to
Respondent's qualification of Section 4.04(c)(vi) of the ARCA that it contained a direct Government guarantee,
while it only contains a provision permitting the Philippines to purchase the Terminal/the assets if there is a
project failure and that the lenders were to be in charge and as confirmed by the Central Bank (Hr. Tr. Day 7,
1740-1749, 1760-1764).

 

 

For Respondent, the ARCA was not consistent with the bidding documents and violated the BOT law as pointed
out by the ICC Technical Working Group and contained more than 80 substantive changes. Nevertheless, the
ARCA was elevated to the ICC Committee where the discussion was limited to Section 4.04(c)(vi) regarding a
direct agreement between the concessionaire and the Senior Lenders (i.e., a USD 440 million Senior Loan
Agreement between PIATCO and the Senior Lenders) and a possible termination payment to be made to the
concessionaire by the Philippines. It follows that the ARCA contained a direct Government guarantee and was
only conditionally approved on June 25 and Aug. 19, 1999 by NEDA-ICC (ICC Minutes - CBII-78; NEDA
Board resolution No. 9 - CBII-89) as the credit agreement between the concessionaire and the Senior Lenders
remained subject to the approval and monitoring by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (“BSP”), to ensure that the
buy-out would only be optional and the termination payment limited (C-Mem., paras. 136-137). According to
Respondent, to comply with the NEDA-ICC conditions, PLATCO submitted an application for approval and
registration of the Senior Loan to the BSP on May 11, 2001 (ICSID-513), which the BSP approved subject to
conditions in July 2001 (ICSID-510). PIATCO failed in June 2001 to submit the complete Government direct
agreement required for the Senior Loan and never received the BSP’s approval (RE-471). More importantly, the
ARCA missed key certifications from the Secretary of Justice and of Finance (R. PHB1, para. 23). (See R.
Slides, Hr. Day 3 and 5 on Tribunal Questions, Sept. 18 and 20, 2013. See C-Mem., paras. 130-139; Rej., para.
169.)

99. On June 25, 1999, the NEDA-ICC approved the ARCA* with the condition that the
Philippine Central Bank reviewed, monitored, and approved the credit agreement between

the Senior Lenders and PIATCO. This was reiterated on August 19, 1999.%°

10

S

Some of the agencies represented on the ICC considered that the ARCA included a direct
governmental guarantee in its Section 4.04(c)(vi). However, the Central Bank’s view —
that the ARCA provided the Government with an optional right to buy-out the Terminal 3

Project in the case of default by PIATCO — prevailed.

10

. In March 2000, after six committee hearings, a review by the House Committee on
Transportation and Communications founds that the award of the Terminal 3 Concession
to PIATCO was “proper and valid,” and the ARCA did not contain a direct governmental

guarantee or other unlawful clauses.°!

On September 20, 2000, an investigation by the Philippine Office of the Ombudsman, in
response to a petition from Mr. Estrella against the former Secretary of the DOTC,
Mr. Rivera, and others, found no probable cause to indict the former DOTC Secretary or
PIATCO’s President for entering into a contract disadvantageous to the Government,

finding it on the contrary advantageous, or violations of the anti-graft laws.”

this provision as a direct guarantee. [...] The BSP’s views the ‘step-in-rights” provision as a buy-out
arrangement.” [...]The meeting clarified that a buyout will constitute a guarantee if the buyout price is more than
the actual price of the asset in question, For the subject project, DOTC clarified that the pricing structure of the
buy-out provision of the contract shall not be construed as a guarantee inasmuch as the claim on the asset would
be based on market value.” Action taken: “The ICC approved the BOT Contract for the project with the

ding that the credit between the ire and the senior lenders shall be subject to the
approval and monitoring by the BSP.”

103. Early 2000, PIATCO selected the Japanese firm Takenaka as the Engineering,
Procurement and Construction (“EPC”) contractor for the Terminal 3 Project. In June
2000, Takenaka began construction on the Terminal 3 Project to be completed in 30
months. According to Fraport, the EPC contractor was paid by PIATCO and Fraport in
total more than US $266.7 million.

Three Supplements to the ARCA were later executed. The Parties also disagree as to the

approval of the ARCA Supplements and as to their validity.

e The First Supplement dated August 27, 1999, concerned inter alia an
extension of time for the Philippines to deliver clean possession of the
Project site and the deletion of an access tunnel between Terminal 2 and 3.86

e The Second Supplement dated September 4, 2000, concerned subterranean
structures and transferred responsibility for clearing the Project site from the
Government to PIATCO.”

e The Third Supplement was executed on June 22, 2001, regarded the
construction of a surface access road connecting Terminals 2 and 3.

5 For Claimant, there was no need for approval of the Supplements as the Second and Third ones were
clarification provisions and that the First Supplement only deviated to one of the monetary compensation due to
the Government but was advantageous (ICSID-1161, ROP-2-00111/00112). See Slides, Hr. Day 5.

none of the received proper app relies on the Minutes
of the Icc Techical Board of Oct. 16, 2001 (RE-507) in which the Board requested the DOTC and MIAA to
submit a letter informing the ICC why the 3 Supplemental Agreements had been executed neither with
justification nor prior ICC approval and explained that this would have bearing on the Monetary Board approval
of the project. According to Secretary Climaco, Fraport was well aware of that fact (RE-109, para. 10). (See
Slides, Hr. Day 5. See C-Mem., paras. 140-145.)

was to defraud the Philippines and to obtain kickbacks benefiting Pantaleon Alvarez and the Chengs by inflating
invoices for the subterranean work done by Wintrack Builders (“Windtrack”), whose owner was Pantaleon
Alvarez, at the time member of the Congress (C-Mem., para. 142). Respondent argues that it was obtained
unlawfully resorting to Mr. Liongson to obtain it by fraud and corrupt payments (C-Mem., paras. 353-355).

e On October 16, 2001, the Third ARCA Supplement was presented to the
ICC for approval. The ICC deferred action pending an explanation from
the DOTC and MIAA as to why the previous ARCA supplements had not
been presented for its approval.”

e A Fourth Supplement was drafted in March 2001, to reflect changes
international banks requested as pre-conditions for the drawdown of long-
term financing and modifying inter alia the Government’s obligations
regarding attendant liabilities, force majeure, incremental and consequential
costs, and other “special obligations,” but was not executed”!

B. Fraport’s Investment in the Terminal 3 Project

. Claimant contends that it had invested by September 2003 more than US $420 million” in

Terminal 3, becoming the principal source of funding for the Terminal 3 Project; this is not
in dispute. Claimant submits that it made equity investment pro rata in PIATCO starting
in 1999 and ending in 2002-2003 and in a cascade of Philippine companies that have
ownership interests in PIATCO. It claims that it is a 30% non-controlling shareholder of
PIATCO and does not hold a controlling share in any of the cascade companies, a

statement that the Respondent disputes.

In 1998, Fraport was retained by PIATCO as a consultant for its technical expertise. In
1999, PIATCO decided to seek Fraport’s financing due to concerns by foreign lenders over

providing long-term project financing.

. In January 1999, PIATCO, seeking Fraport’s investment, proposed a “master concession

concept,” involving a shareholder agreement that would give Fraport full executive and

” According to Fraport, the total amount of its investment to take into account additional payments for the period
of September 2003 to July 2012 is US $510 million (Sur-Rej., fn. 1). See PwC I (ICSID 2), para. 20. Respondent
contends that Fraport has failed to establish that 93% of its payments had a legitimate purpose (“theory of the
proper use”), and that US $123 million of soft costs are red flags of corruption and fraud (R. PHB1, para. 65).

. Fraport and PIATCO’s other shareholders entered into a series of shareholder agreements
starting in 1999.7 As part of the agreements entered into in July 1999, the company

view to enter into an operations and maintenance agreement with PIATCO, and through

which PTI would have become the facility operator of Terminal 3.80

that (i) Section 4.04(c)(vi) of the ARCA contained a direct Government guarantee of PIATCO’s debts and
liabilities, (ii) the NEDA had not approved the Concession Agreement or the ARCA, (iii) that the changes to the
Concession Agreement were unlawful and grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the Government, and (iv)
there was serious doubt over the legal authority of the DOTC to enter into the Concession Agreement and ARCA.

39. Fraport’s indirect investment in PIATCO by means of interests in cascade
companies allowed Fraport to make equity investments required by its
agreements with its fellow project participants all of which comply with
Philippine laws requiring control of public utilities by Philippine nationals.
The following is an overview of Fraport’s acquisition of its direct and
indirect interests in PLATCO:

(a) Under four agreements dated July 6, 1999 (the “1999 Share Purchase
Agreements and Share Subscription Agreements”), Fraport acquired 25%
of PIATCO, 40% of PTI and 40% of PTH, and PTI acquired 11% of
PIATCO.

(b) Fraport’s shareholdings were increased pursuant to two agreements
dated May 5, 2000 (the “2000 Share Purchase Agreements”). Under these
two agreements Fraport acquired an additional 5% of PIATCO, and PTI
acquired another 24% of PIATCO.

(c) In 2001, Fraport acquired a 40% stake in PAGS. PAGS holds a 10%
direct shareholding in PIATCO. PAGS also has 12.6% indirect
shareholding in PIATCO as a result of PAGS’s 60% shareholding in PTH
and PTH’s 60% shareholding in PTI, which owns 35% of PIATCO. This
results in Fraport having an additional 9.04% indirect interest in PIATCO.

4

S

Accordingly, Fraport owns directly 30% of PIATCO; Fraport owns
indirectly through its direct investment in PTI 14% of PIATCO; Fraport
owns indirectly through its direct investment in PTH 8.4% of PIATCO, and
Fraport owns indirectly through its direct investment in PAGS 9.04% of
PIATCO. The result is Fraport’s 61.44% direct and indirect ownership in
PIATCO.*!

113. One of the 1999 agreements at stake is the so-called “Pooling Agreement.”*?

Collectively,
the parties to this agreement owned a 51% stake in PIATCO. Article 2 of the Pooling
Agreement provided that Fraport, PTI, PAIRCARGO, and PAGS - and their nominees on
PIATCO’s board — were to vote together as a block, with common positions to be
determined through discussion. If such discussions did not lead to unanimity, Section 2.02
provided that the parties were to consult FAG/Fraport on issues within its area of expertise
(i.e., terminal operations and management) and that the “Shareholders shall thereafter act
upon the recommendations of FAG.” Section 2.05, in contrast, required the parties “to
adopt and vote strictly in accordance with the position taken by PAGS” when its business
operations — ground services (e.g., baggage handling, catering, refueling) — are affected

and, likewise, to “adopt and vote strictly in accordance with” the positions of PAGS or

PAIRCARGO in their respective areas of operations (i.e., airline services for PAGS and

cargo services for PAIRCARGO).

Fraport claims that the Pooling Agreement was only in effect until August 23, 2001, when
it was amended by another agreement.™* Whether the Pooling Agreement complied with

local Anti-Dummy Law is debated between the Parties.

. Under a Memorandum of Agreement dated July 7, 1999,85 Fraport was to lead in obtaining
international financing for the Project, becoming the “finance arranger.” Fraport secured a
Senior Loan Agreement on July 27, 2001, subject to condition precedents, as explained

below.*°

Fraport proceeded to provide loans to the Chengs, the main shareholders of PAGS as of
July 6, 1999*” and appointed Fraport’s officials to serve in PIATCO and PTI’s boards.

The Parties disagree as to the extent and the legality of such appointments.
. In January 2001, President Arroyo replaced President Estrada.

In January-June 2001, Fraport (with PIATCO allegedly on the brink of insolvency as a
result of having not obtained the necessary external financing while needing to pay
Takenaka on the EPC Contract) provided a further US $409 million in loans and loan
guarantees and further pledges of equity contributions. Fraport begun making payments on

the guarantees to Takenaka in August 2001.

terrorist attacks, which had a significant negative effect on PAL’s business.

12

S

In June 2001, PIATCO (and Fraport according to the Respondent) retained Mr. Alberto
Liongson as a “marketing and government relations” consultant to assist in obtaining
crucial government agreements that would enable PLATCO to make use of the conditional
Senior Loan Agreement (which would be executed the following month). The Liongson’s
contract provided for payments of US $200,000 up front, US $200,000 per month, and a
total of US $1.8 million in milestone payments upon obtaining each agreement. The
Parties are at odds as to the effects and legality of such consultancy; each Party claiming
that it had been the victim of corruption for Respondent or of a kickback scheme for

Claimant.”

12

. As indicated above, on July 27, 2001, Fraport and the Senior Lenders executed an
agreement establishing a US $440 million financing facility for the Terminal 3 Project,

with availability of the funds subject to a number of conditions precedent, including:

¢ Approval of the Project, the ARCA, and the three ARCA Supplements by
the ICC;

¢ Confirmation of the DOTC’s authority to enter into agreements such as the

ARCA on behalf of the Philippine Government;

¢ Legal opinions from the Philippine DOJ and SEC as to the legality of the
ARCA and its Supplements and PIATCO’s shareholding structure,

respectively; and

¢ Approval of a direct agreement between the Government and Senior

122. On August 23, 2001, Fraport and other shareholders amended the 1999 Pooling Agreement
to remove Fraport’s right to make recommendations to the other PLATCO shareholders.”!
According to Fraport, some of the 1999 agreements between Fraport and PIATCO’s other
shareholders were amended in August 2001° to take into account the Senior Lenders’

suggestions in order to secure the loan and to receive the satisfaction notice under the

escrow arrangements with the Lenders.” For Respondent, this amendment was made

because it desperately needed long term financing.

** According to Fraport, at that time, the Terminal was more than 50% complete. Claimant submits that Secretary
Climaco had no expertise in airport or infrastructure projects. Her appointment followed a campaign against
Fraport. Claimant contends that she was connected to key players in the project, being the managing partner of
the accounting firm Sycip Gorres Velayo & Co., the firm acting for Lucio Tan and AEDC during the bidding
process. She also served on PAL board of directors and was named to the board of the Philippines National
Bank, Lucio Tan’s asset. Her legal advisor was Ms. Cinthya Nuval-Ambrosio who was the associate in charge of
AEDC matters at the law firm of Villaraza & Cruz. (Mr. Villaraza was also President Arroyo’s personal lawyer.
Claimant also claims that Mr. Villaraza made an extortion attempt in 2002 (Mem., para. 215).) Claimant also
alleges that Climaco resigned few days after President Arroyo declared the contract null in 2002 and was then
engaged as Lucio Tan’s consultant. Fraport claims that she held discussions with Fraport, and refused to speak to
PIATCO. Claimant also contends that she entered into suspicious cash transactions. Claimant points out to
“evidence of cronyism and government abuse” (Cl. PHB2, paras. 79-87). Respondent disputes this (C-Mem.,
paras. 636-640 and R. PHBI, para. 136). The Tribunal notes that Secretary Climaco was not made available for
cross-examination.

eight months of negotiations. Climaco insisted on changes to the Terminal 3 concession

agreements.

The Parties disagree about the reasons for the negotiations with Climaco. Respondent
alleges that Fraport was seeking assistance from the Government to obtain approvals
necessary to begin drawing upon the Senior Loan Facility, given the Project’s financial
straits. °° Claimant alleges that Climaco was directed to seek renegotiation of the
Concession to make it more favorable to well-connected business interests associated with

PAL and that she wanted the Chengs out.””

. A second review by the House Committee on Transportation and Communications found
in December 2001 that the Terminal 3 Concession was awarded properly and the

Concession Agreement, as amended, was valid.°®

In January 2002, Climaco proposed a Fifth ARCA Supplement to bring the ARCA in line
with the original Bid documents and eliminate the alleged governmental guarantee and

other legal infirmities.”

In March 2002, the Ombudsman rejected a petition from a Graft Investigation Officer,
Edgard Navales, alleging corruption on the part of DOTC Secretary Alvarez and others in

awarding the Terminal 3 Concession to PIATCO. 100

In April 2002, in the face of growing financial concerns with the Terminal 3 Project,
Fraport replaced its representatives in Manila, especially replacing Mr. Bernd Struck by

Mr. Peter Engel as chairman of PIATCO.

August 2002, Fraport and Respondent nearly reached an agreement for the Philippines to

buy-out the Terminal 3 Concession. ‘01 Claimant argues that Climaco abandoned her own
plan after it became public and the press criticized it as evidence of bad governance and

2

self-dealing. to Respondent argues that the agreement fell apart because the Chengs

insisted on an unreasonably high price for the buy-out.

In September 2002, with relations between Fraport and the Chengs having deteriorated (for
disputed reasons), Fraport attempted but failed to restructure PIATCO. 04 Fraport decided

to not provide further bridge financing for PIATCO. 105

D. Nullification of the Terminal 3 Concession

. The Senate Blue Ribbon Committee held hearings as of the end of August 2002 further to

a petition filed in 2001 by a number of Senators calling for the investigation of the Project.

The Committee issued a report on December 10, 2002.

In parallel, representatives of MASO, employees of MIAA and Members of Congress!
filed petitions at the Supreme Court for a writ of prohibition to keep the Philippines from
enforcing the concession agreements and allowing Terminal 3 to come into service. (Three
of these petitions Agan, Baterina and Lopez would be consolidated into the Agan case

against PLATCO.)

In response to these petitions, on September 9, 2002, President Arroyo established an inter-
agency Cabinet Review Committee to formulate the Government’s position vis-a-vis the
Terminal 3 Concession. The committee, in turn, established a Technical Working Group

to review the commercial and legal issues with the Terminal 3 Concession. tor

The Technical Working Group issued an initial report on September 25, 2002, to which
Climaco objected on the basis that it “presumed” the validity of the ARCA." The
Technical Working Group thus recommended that the DOJ, the SEC, and the Office of
Government Corporate Counsel (“OGCC”) formulated the official Government position on

the legality of the Terminal 3 Concession.”

. On September 26, 2002, Secretary Climaco submitted a memorandum to the Senate Blue

Ribbon Committee expressing the view that the Terminal 3 concession contracts were

110
The

“intrinsically void” and that a declaration of nullity should be obtained.
memorandum also detailed lack of government planning in awarding the Terminal 3
Concession and financial repercussions to the Government for failing to achieve
renegotiation and argued that PIATCO lacked the necessary financial qualification at the
time it was awarded the Concession. Climaco also recommended that President Arroyo

seek to nullify the Terminal 3 Concession.

On September 30, 2002, in response to a separate request from the MIAA as to whether the
1997 Agreement, the ARCA and the three Supplements were valid, the OGCC issued a
report upholding the validity of the concession agreements, but stating that the onerous
provisions, if any, should be negotiated/re-negotiated.'!! The OGCC further stated that the
Government could not seek to nullify the agreements, as it had already accepted benefits

derived from them.'!?

On November 7, 2002, under a newly appointed Corporate Counsel, the OGCC argued to
the Supreme Court that the original Concession Agreement be declared valid and binding
but that the ARCA and its Supplements were void insofar as they deviated from the

provisions of the original Concession Agreement.''°

On November 11, 2002, the newly appointed Philippine Solicitor General, Alfredo
Benipayo, filed a brief before the Supreme Court in another case against PLATCO seeking

to reinstate the terms of the original Concession Agreement and Bid documents. ''®

. On November 18, 2002, the Philippine Solicitor General, in a further filing argued that all

of the concession agreements were void because the deviations from the Bid documents
were not publicly bid in accordance with the BOT law, as well the existence of a direct

government guarantee in the ARCA. i

On November 28, 2002, the DOJ, under the freshly appointed Secretary Merceditas
Gutierrez,'!® issued an official position that the Terminal 3 Concession was void because
the deviations from the original Bid documents, combined with the failure to allow AEDC

to match the terms of PIATCO’s bid, unlawfully placed PIATCO in a more favorable

Supplements were further void because they contained additional deviations from the Bid

documents.

143. On November 29, 2002, a month before Terminal 3 was scheduled to enter into
commercial operations, |” President Arroyo announced that the Terminal 3 concession
agreements were null and void and would not be honored. 121 President Arroyo also
promised compensation for the funds expended in constructing Terminal 3 until that point
and further directed the DOJ and the Presidential Anti-Graft Commission (“PAGC’”) to

investigate and prosecute any criminal violations associated with the Concession.
144. On the same day, Takenaka, the EPC contractor, stopped working on Terminal 3.

145. On December 9, 2002, the Solicitor General filed a supplemental brief before the Supreme
Court, arguing that the award of the Terminal 3 Concession was void because the
PAIRCARGO Consortium did not meet the financial qualifications at the time of the

award. '??

146. On December 10, 2002, the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee issued its final report, 73
concluding that (1) the Terminal 3 Concession Agreement was intrinsically void because
six required signatures from ICC members were not obtained, (2) the concession
agreements were void because of deviations from the Bid documents, (3) the concession
agreements contained onerous provisions that were contrary to public policy and the BOT
law, (4) improper payments had been made to Liongson, (5) the Concession provided for a
prohibited direct Government guarantee, and (6) the condition of the Terminal raised

serious security concerns.

154. On May 5, 2003, the Philippine Supreme Court issued the Agan decision, ~~ declaring

Terminal 3 Concession null and void ab initio on the following grounds:

e The PAIRCARGO Consortium lacked the initial financial qualifications
and PBAC had erred in calculating the basis for the consortium’s financial

prequalification.

e Post-award modifications to the 1997 Concession Agreement provided
financial advantages to PIATCO that were not available during the
bidding process and required the government to provide a “form of
security” for loans to PIATCO. Therefore, the Agreement was void as

contrary to public policy.

e The ARCA provided for a direct guarantee by the Government, in the

event of PLATCO’s default, which was prohibited by the BOT law.

e A provision requiring that the Government pay compensation to PIATCO
if it temporary took over the terminal in a time of war hampered the
Government’s exercise of its police powers and contravened the

Philippine Constitution.

e The provisions in the 1997 Concession Agreement and the ARCA

granting PIATCO exclusive rights to control service provider concessions

at Terminal 3 and requiring the Government to terminate existing NAIA

service provider contracts were impermissible.

. According to Fraport, at the time of the Agan decision, Terminal 3 was more than 90%

complete, '*? which is disputed by Respondent.

On June 25, 2003, President Arroyo established a Cabinet Oversight Committee on
Terminal 3 to find a final and comprehensive solution. No agreement was found and the

Committee was dissolved in March 2004.4

In September 2003, Fraport initiated the first ICSID arbitration under the BIT.

E. Further 2003/2004 Proceedings

In October 2003, the Philippine National Bureau of Investigation begun criminal
investigations into ADL violations by Fraport officials, on the basis of evidence of
Fraport’s shareholdings in PIATCO and the cascade companies contained in Fraport’s
ICSID submissions, as opposed to the “interference” grounds for the violation alleged in

this arbitration.

From October 2003 to September 2004, private civil and criminal libel complaints were
filed against Fraport executives and its Philippine counsel by President Arroyo’s personal
lawyer, Arthur Villaraza, and Secretary Climaco, based on statements from Fraport’s

ICSID first request for arbitration that were published in Philippine newspapers. 135

In December 2003, German law enforcement searched Fraport’s offices in Frankfurt in
connection with an ongoing German criminal investigation regarding bribery and

corruption in the Terminal 3 Project. (No charges were ever filed in Germany.) The

Philippines Solicitor General and chief arbitration counsel made a mutual legal assistance

request of Germany for evidence of corruption. 186

. In August 2004, a German prosecutor requested that the Philippines provided details of the

alleged offender, acts, and criminal violations in support of its legal assistance request. '*”

On September 16, 2004, upon AEDC’s request, the Ombusdman for Luzon recommended
to indict numerous current or former Government officials, including Pantaleon Alvarez,
together with PIATCO and Fraport officials and Alfonson Liongson with respect to the

Terminal 3 Project. 188

F. The Government’s Taking of NAIA Terminal 3

. On January and February 2004, PLATCO was denied its motions for reconsideration of the

Agan Decision. 189

In May 2004, President Arroyo was elected for her second term (she stepped down in

2010).

On December 21, 2004, with PIATCO and the Philippines failing to reach a settlement
over the ownership of Terminal 3 (and Fraport, as a minority shareholder, unable to settle
separately), '“° the Philippine Solicitor General applied for and received an ex parte court
order — a Writ of Possession — authorizing the expropriation (i.e., exercise of eminent

domain) of Terminal 3. Mal

On the same day, the Philippine armed forces took control of Terminal 3.

By orders of January 4 and 7, 2005, the Regional Trial Court (aka, the expropriation court)
ordered the payment of the proffered value of US $62 million to PIATCO and appointed,
pursuant to statutory procedures, an independent board of commissioners to conduct a

valuation of the expropriated property. ed

Under Philippine law, following an order of expropriation, the expropriation court
determines the amount of compensation due, under the Philippine law standard of
“replacement value.” The procedure in such cases involves up-front payment of “proffered
value” with subsequent judicial determination within 60 days as to whether additional “just

compensation” is owed. 48

On January 13, 2005, Respondent filed criminal charges against governmental, PIATCO,
and Fraport officials involved in the Terminal 3 concession award and subsequent

supplemental agreements. 4

In September 2005, the Philippines resubmitted its request for legal assistance to the
German prosecutor, on the basis of the rights it would have as a victim of the corruption

charged in January 2005. 145

. On December 13, 2005, a German prosecutor granted the Philippines access to seized files

the documents. “8

173. On December 19, 2005, upon the Philippines’ appeal of the expropriation court’s order of
January 2005 regarding the amount of proffered value, the Supreme Court held the Writ of
Possession in abeyance until the Philippines paid the amount determined by the Supreme

Court to be appropriate as proffered value. na

On September 11, 2006, further to the Supreme Court decision of December 2005, the

~

In December 2006, the DOJ rejected a recommendation to charge various Fraport officials
and its international counsel with ADL violations, concluding that the “Grandfather Rule”
no longer applied and that the Agan decision made the ADL inapplicable to Fraport and
PIATCO.'*

179. On March 15, 2007, the DOJ reversed position and decided to file criminal charges for
violations of the ADL against Fraport officials and outside counsel, include Fraport’s
official, Peter Henkel, Dietrich Stiller, Hans Arthur Vogel, Sanim Aydin, and PIATCO’s
Cheng Yong. 1s4

180. On August 16, 2007, the first ICSID Tribunal issues its Award in favor of Respondent.'*°
The Tribunal declared that it had no jurisdiction ratione materiae because “Fraport

knowingly and intentionally circumvented the ADL by means of secret shareholders

agreements” '°° and “Fraport’s ostensible purchase of shares in the Terminal 3 Project,

which concealed a different type of unlawful investment, is not an ‘investment’” made in

accordance with Philippines law.'°’ Dr. Bernardo Cremades dissented, stating in short that
Fraport’s shareholdings constituted an investment under the BIT, that whether there was a
breach of the ADL was an issue for the merits and that Respondent had not demonstrated

in any event a violation by PIATCO of the ADL, nor by Fraport as an accomplice.'**

. On November 2007, the criminal respondents (i.e., Fraport officials and counsel)

petitioned the DOJ Secretary for review of the ADL charges of March 2007. The petitions

remained pending until January 201 11°

On January 8, 2008, Fraport’s application for the annulment of the ICSID Award was

registered.

. Since mid-2008, according to Fraport, the Philippines started to operate the Terminal 3.

. In January 2009, the DOJ officially resolved to file libel charges against Fraport’s local

rae 160
arbitration counsel.

In August 2009, the Philippines admitted to the ad hoc annulment Committee that “all

[criminal] investigations had been completed.” tel

On July 22, 2010, the ICC Tribunal dismissed PIATCO’s claims as inadmissible, given
PIATCO’s violations of the Philippine ADL.'® According to Fraport, the Philippines
misled the ICC tribunal into believing that its involvement in PIATCO violated the
ADL! &

On December 23, 2010, the ICSID 1 Award was annulled in its entirety by the ad hoc
Committee.“ The Committee found that the ICSID 1 Tribunal had seriously departed
from a fundamental rule of procedure, prejudicing Fraport.'° The ICSID 1 Tribunal was
found not to have interrupted its deliberations, closing the proceedings and refusing to

On May 23, 2011, the expropriation court found that the compensation owed to PIATCO

As of November 2014, to the knowledge of the Tribunal, also on the basis of the record,
there had been no convictions or indictments of Government officials for having accepted
bribes. Nor have there been any firm conviction for ADL violations or corruption in the
Philippines, nor convictions in Germany. Except for the pending-suspended ADL charges
and the case against Henry Go, all criminal investigations relating to Terminal 3 have been

dismissed in the Philippines.

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

The Tribunal will now provide a summary of the Parties’ positions, starting with
Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility, followed by Fraport’s claims and
Respondent’s counterclaims. To the extent relevant or useful, additional arguments will be

discussed in the Tribunal’s analysis below.

V.I RESPONDENT’S OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and to the admissibility of Fraport’s
claims because it argues that Fraport is in violation of Philippine law, based on Fraport’s
alleged ADL violations, Fraport’s alleged corruption, and failure to sufficiently

substantiate the ultimate use of its claimed investment in the Terminal 3.

A. Respondent’s Basis for its Objections to Jurisdiction and Inadmissibility

«

. According to Respondent, the BIT does not apply to investments made in violation of
Philippine law. Article 1(1) of the BIT defines “investment” as “any kind of asset accepted
in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State [...].”
Thus, Fraport must demonstrate that it has “‘an investment” that complied with Philippines
Jaw and regulations. '88 This is a legality requirement, which is supported by the remainder
of the BIT and its Protocol.'*” Not only Fraport’s investment was illegal for the alleged
reasons that the Tribunal will examine below, but it was not “accepted” by the

Philippines. '!°°

©

Even without taking the terms of Article 1(1) of the BIT into account, for Respondent, all

191

BITs contain a tacit jurisdictional requirement of legality ~" and the Tribunal has no

jurisdiction over disputes involving investment made in violation of host State law. '?

o

. In addition, Respondent argues that “regardless of whether Fraport’s unlawful investment

»» 193

is considered to satisfy the BIT’s definition of an investment, its claims are

inadmissible on the basis of the doctrine of clean hands and the requirement of good faith,
relying mainly on Bin Cheng and World Duty Free v. Kenya, because Fraport invested in

violation of Philippine law and international public policy, and that its investment was

illegal.'*

de facto continuous one,’ but rather that Article 1(1) was designed as an admittance

clause, as supported by the travaux préparatoires.'°°

. Fraport further argues that the concept of admissibility based on clean hands does not

apply here as Respondent has not shown corruption and “should not be able to use its own
illegal acts of extortion and corruption in order to take operational Terminal without
compensation.”!”” It considers that the allegations of corruption have nothing to do with
Fraport’s investment, or the legality of such investment, either in time or facts, pointing out
for instance that the acquisition of shares has never been illegal. 198 Respondent replies that

there is no temporal limitation for the doctrine of admissibility. 199

In any event, Fraport also counter-argues that all its discrete and multiple investments are
entitled to the protection of the Bir.° Respondent dismisses this theory based on the
“unity of investment” doctrine and argues that corruption taints the entirety of an

investment.?”!

B. Fraport Knowingly Based its Investment on a Concession that had been
Illegally Obtained and that was Invalid under Philippine Law

. According to Respondent, the clean hands doctrine applies to render inadmissible claims

relating to an investment that was procured through fraudulent misrepresentations. 202
PIATCO made material misrepresentations regarding its financial capacity and technical
qualifications to PBAC. PAIRCARGO misrepresented its proposed annual guaranteed

payments. Fraport is said to have joined in with this fraudulent conduct because it knew

before it made its own investment that PIATCO has secured the Terminal 3 Concession

under false pretenses.”

. Fraport also knew that the concessions agreements were in violation of the BOT law,

including an unlawful direct Government guarantee in Section 4.04(c)(iv) of the ARCA,
the lack of NEDA’s approval of the Concession Agreement or the ARCA, and were
missing critical approvals of the DOTC and the Minister of Finance that could not be

legally obtained.”

Fraport denies those allegations and claims that it had every reason to believe that
PIATCO achieved the award and concession agreements through legitimate means, which

in any event turns to be the case.?5

C. Fraport Violated the Anti-Dummy Law

Respondent alleges that Fraport’s investment in PIATCO violated the 1936 ADL, as
Fraport deliberately assisted, aided and/or abetted in the “planning” of an ADL violation,
which deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction over Fraport’s claims and renders such claims

: «ct py a 206
inadmissible.

1. The Philippine Anti-Dummy Law

The Philippine Constitution restricts operation of a public utility (which the Parties agree
includes Terminal 3) to Philippine citizens or corporations established under Philippine
law at least 60% of whose capital is owned by Philippine citizens. The ADL, designed to
prevent circumvention of such nationality requirements, prohibits in Section 2-A
“interven[tion] in the management, operation, administration, or control” of, inter alia,

public utilities by persons who do not meet the nationality requirements.

219. According to Respondent, Section 2-A of the ADL imposes two general restrictions: (i) it

221

22

S

prohibits Philippine entities from allowing an unqualified person to intervene into the
management, operation, or control of a public utility, and (ii) it prohibits any person,
including foreigners, from knowingly aiding, assisting or abetting in the planning,

consummation, or perpetration of an ADL violation.”””

Respondent submits that the fact that there was no finding of an ADL violation in local
proceedings is irrelevant because the DOJ investigations are focused on different facts and

«208
claims.

For Respondent, “[t]he DOJ proceeding is focused on Fraport’s violation of the
60/40 Philippine nationality requirement and the method to calculate a corporation’s
nationality. In contrast, the claims in this arbitration are focused on Fraport’s intervention
into the management, operation, administration or control of public utility corporations in

circumvention of those Philippine nationality requirements.””””

. Fraport considers that the ADL is an (old) criminal law (hence subject to strict

construction)*! applied inconsistently by Philippines agencies with little judicial guidance
on what it proscribes.7!! Tt contends that at the time of its investment, the control test was
to apply in determining the nationality and not the computation of equity interest (so called
Grandfather Rule) as claimed by Respondent.” It points out that any violation can be

cured,” ~ and dismisses any wrongdoing.

2. Fraport’s Alleged ADL Violations
Respondent argues that Fraport violated the ADL in five ways,”!4 relying on expert legal
opinions from Dean Concepcion and former Chief Justice Puno. Fraport allegedly violated
the ADL by:

(i) having a right of recommendation under the Pooling Agreement;

(ii) being the Financial Arranger in the Project;

(iii) placing non-Filipino officials in management roles at PLATCO and PTI;

(iv) having a veto power over PTI’s corporate decisions; and

(v) having a right to appoint PLIATCO board members in excess of limitations.7!

. Fraport, relying on expert legal opinions from former Justice Melo, former Secretary of

Justice Tuquero, and Dean Pangalangan (jointly), and former Justice Vitug, argues that it
has always complied with the applicable legal regulations, and that Fraport did not aid or
abet in any ADL violation, failing for Respondent to have identified the principal offender
and for the violation to be consummated.*'® It claims to have amended in 2001 the
contractual arrangements curing any potential violation, leading Respondent to admit in
the first arbitration that it resulted in a “lawful Shareholder Structure.”?!” It further points
out that ADL investigations have commenced in 2003, further to Fraport’s first request for

arbitration.

224. Fraport also makes the following cross-cutting responses to Respondent’s charges:

e The nationality requirement apply to the “operation of a public utility” (rather
than the pre-operation construction phase), so that Fraport could not have

Section 2-A of the ADL does not apply to shareholder conduct.?!?

e  Fraport never controlled PIATCO, the Chengs did???

D. Fraport’s Corruption and Unlawful Conduct Render its Claims Inadmissible

. Respondent submits that Fraport was involved in or aware of corruption and fraud in

implementing the Terminal 3 Project, which makes Fraport’s claims inadmissible.”!

. According to Respondent, the Tribunal may rely on recognized “red-flags” and
presumption in assessing Respondent’s prima facie evidence of corruption. 22
Respondent’s evidence is sufficient to prove the corruption and Fraport was unable to offer
rebuttal evidence.” Fraport replies that Respondent has failed to meet the high burden of

Pu ae “ ” « - «ag 224
proof, i.e. “clear and convincing evidence,” that corruption allegations require.

In particular, Respondent alleges that Fraport participated in bribing various Philippine
officials — mainly via Alfonso Liongson and a kickback scheme involving politically-
connected subcontractors — to obtain various government approvals (e.g., amendments to

the Concession Agreement) necessary to the Project.

1. The Four “Liongson Schemes” to Procure Government Approvals

. Respondent alleges that PLATCO (with Fraport’s involvement) paid more than US $10.6
million to the Chengs — the Philippine family that owned the controlling share of PLATCO

. According to Respondent, these payments were used to secure various Government

approvals related to the Terminal 3 Concession. Specifically:

e US $2.6 million in payments were made to the Chengs and Top Victory’s
accounts within 23 days of DOTC’s approval of the Second Supplement to
ARCA. The Second Supplement added demolition of below-ground
structures to PIATCO’s responsibilities, thus allegedly allowing it to enter
into a kickback scheme with a subcontractor, Wintrack (described infra).>"

¢ US $2.3 million in payments were made to the Chengs over the four months
surrounding the approval by DOTC Secretary Pantaleon Alvarez (who
allegedly had close connections to the Chengs) of PIATCO’s request to relax
the required 70:30 debt-equity financing ratio for to the Terminal 3
Concession. This approval was required to continue to fund the construction
of Terminal 3, as PIATCO’s Philippine shareholders could not or would not
increase their equity investment and Fraport was not legally allowed to do
so.

¢ US $4.9 million in payments were made to the Chengs and Top Victory in the
weeks prior to and after DOTC’s approval of PTI as the contractor-operator of
Terminal 3 and of the Third Supplement to the ARCA. The Third Supplement
changed the terms of the agreement with respect to the construction of a road,
which allegedly provided the opportunity for further corruption.””?

argue that the nature of these payments, the structure of PLATCO’s contract with Liongson,
Liongson’s lack of qualifications to perform the public relations services for which he was

9231 are

purportedly hired, and an allegedly extraordinarily high level of Project “soft costs
indicative of bribery, which should shift the burden of proof to Fraport to show that

PIATCO did not procure these government approvals through bribery.”

2. The EPC Contract Schedule 7 Kickback Scheme

. Under Schedule 7 of the EPC Contract between PIATCO and Takenaka, PIATCO’s

preferred subcontractors were provided the opportunity to match the lowest bid for a
subcontract, in which case the contractor was required to use PIATCO’s preferred

233
subcontractor.

Respondent explains that this provides the opportunity for inferior
subcontractors to obtain subcontracts through corruption, as was the case with a GE
subsidiary, which was found (according to charges filed by the US SEC) to have bribed a

Philippine government official to obtain a subcontract for explosive detection devices.?™

. According to Respondent, subcontractors would underprice the works to be performed and

kick back the difference between the cost and the amount budgeted under the EPC to
PIATCO, which then used those funds to bribe Philippine officials.” Respondent claims

that Fraport can be held responsible for these schemes because two members of the four-

Fraport.”**

3. Improper Receipt of Funds by Fraport Officials

Respondent also alleges that three Fraport officials improperly received money in the

course of the Terminal 3 Concession, which they deposited into offshore accounts.”

4. Fraport’s Responses

. Fraport rejects Respondent’s allegations, arguing that Respondent’s corruption claims are

not credible or relevant and unsupported by evidence. In particular, Fraport makes the

following overarching points:

e Respondent has not produced any evidence of bribery, relying solely on the
inferences of its experts.“” Fraport strongly objects to Respondent’s expert

witness Juval Aviv, calling him a “complete fraud.”*4!

e Moreover, Respondent has not shown how allegedly corrupt officials were
responsible for the five Government approvals that it specifically alleges were
procured through bribery, given the number of other officials involved;
ignores the other 33 Government approvals that PIATCO received; and has

“wild inconsistencies” in the timing between the allegedly corrupt payments
and the approvals allegedly procured thereby, including a number made after
President Arroyo’s announcement that the Philippines would not honor the
Concession Agreement.”

e The Philippines has not indicted or convicted a single Government official for
receiving bribes in connection with the Terminal 3 concession, nor are there
any ongoing investigations.” The only indictment of Fraport officials (but
not the Government officials involved) was in 2005 for signing the Third
Supplement to the ARCA which was alleged to have been illegally
advantageous to PIATCO.”* Moreover, every investigation into corruption
with respect to the Terminal 3 Concession has been dismissed.”

e Respondent has not alleged any corruption with respect to the award of the
Terminal 3 Concession or Fraport’s making of its investment.”*°

e Many of the witnesses relied upon by Respondent for its allegations have
previously contradicted their statements or claimed no knowledge or any

e The Wintrack contract was made more than 3 years after the award of the
Project. Everyone involved in the Wintrack contract was exonerated.”

contractors, but only allowed Schedule 7 sub-contractors to be considered in

5. Respondent’s Argument Relating to Fraport’s Ultimate Use of the Funds Put

in the Project
Finally, in relation to bribery, fraud and corruption, Respondent argues that Fraport has not
sufficiently substantiated the ultimate use of its claimed investment in the Terminal 3

Project, which also includes questionable payments and unexplained uses of funds.**?

Respondent submits that Fraport failed to produce evidence that demonstrates “the ultimate
4

use” of its investment, indicating further fraud and corruption. 35 According to
Respondent, Fraport cannot prove it spent US $565 million on the Project and cannot
evidence their use in the Project. In other words, according to Respondent, Fraport failed
to establish any “legitimate purpose” for 93% of its payments.” Soft costs in an amount

d,°°° as well as payment of US $4

of US $123 million would be another indicator of frau
million to Datacenta, a consultant, for a contract of an unknown nature, 257 Which
Respondent claims to be a sham for payments to President Estrada and the Zamoras

family.?° 8

. Fraport considers that its investments have translated into an indirect economic interest in

the concession agreements and the Terminal.

As for the outgoing payments, they are detailed in PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) five

reports spanning both arbitrations. As of July 2012, Fraport’s financial contributions

amount to US $510,639,079 excluding interest. According to Fraport, Respondent does
not dispute that Fraport made the payments that make up these contributions, such as
payment to Takenaka (US $192 million from Fraport?? and US $83 million from
PIATCO). 7 Indeed, Respondent’s own expert Mr. Silverstone confirmed the same
amount of Fraport’s nearly US $400 million in outgoing payments as PwC.?°!

Fraport contends that the “ultimate use” concept is a creation of the Philippines, is
unsupported in the legal literature, and is fundamentally flawed. It argues that (i) Fraport’s
documentation is consistent with its role in the Project as a minority shareholder, lender
and guarantor, but Fraport is not the Project company (PIATCO) or the construction
company (Takenaka) and therefore cannot be expected to have in its possession
documentation for every single expense those companies have incurred, (ii) the ultimate
use of 88% (or US $369.4 million) of Fraport’s investment has been conclusively
established: US $266.7 was paid to the EPC contractors (as the value of the EPC Contract
was US $323 million) as documented by Interim Payment Certificates, (iii) Respondent

262

was an active participant in the construction process. As to soft costs, they typically

range from a low of 20% to a high of 43% 73

. According to Claimant, the size of Fraport’s financial contributions, although substantial,

has no bearing on whether Fraport has a legal or proven investment. Respondent insisted
on a bifurcated arbitration and the precise value of the Terminal should be an issue for the

quantum phase, not the jurisdiction and merits phase.?™

V.IT_ SUMMARY OF FRAPORT’S CLAIMS AND RELIEFS

Fraport considers that the Arroyo’s administration destroyed its investment in the Terminal
3 Project. More specifically, it claims that the Arroyo administration, with the action of
Secretary Climaco, sought to remove the key fundamentals of the Project (Terminal 3 was
to handle exclusively all international flights and all duty free operations at NAIA), to
favor President Arroyo’s “cronies,” and more specifically Lucio Tan, through PAL and
MASO that were to suffer financially from such an exclusivity. Failing to renegotiate the
concession agreements, the Administration declared the Concession null and void, a
decision endorsed by the Supreme Court. Since, it is argued that Respondent has failed to

pay compensation.

. Fraport claims that the Philippines has (i) unlawfully expropriated its investment in

violation of Article 4(2) of the BIT on expropriation, (ii) failed to accord Fraport and its
investment fair and equitable treatment under Article 2(1) of the BIT, (iii) subjected
Fraport and its investments to arbitrary treatment in violation of Article 2(2) of the BIT,
(iv) subjected Fraport and its investments to discriminatory treatment in violation of
Article 2(2) of the BIT, (v) failed to afford Fraport full protection and security in violation
of Article 4(1) of the BIT, and (vi) breached Article 3(5) of the BIT—the umbrella

clause—in breaching the express terms of the concession agreements.

A. Fraport’s Claims for Expropriation

1. The Alleged Acts of Expropriation

. Fraport alleges that Respondent expropriated its investment in the Terminal 3 Project (i.e.,

its economic interest in the concession agreements, in the Terminal 3 building and its loans
and shares),”°> in violation of Article 4(2) of the BIT, through the cumulative effects of

following actions:

e President Arroyo’s declaration that the Terminal 3 Concession would not be
honored;

Cl. PHB1, para. 222.

74

e The DOJ’s declaration that the 1997 Concession Agreement and the ARCA
were void;

e The “coercion” applied to Fraport by Secretary Climaco and others to
renegotiate the concession agreements;

e Respondent’s alleged refusal to perform duties under the concession
agreements necessary to bring Terminal 3 into commercial operation, such as
installing immigration and customs facilities and requiring PAL and other
carriers to move their international operations to Terminal 3;

e The Supreme Court’s Agan decision nullifying the Terminal 3 concession; and

e The taking of physical possession of Terminal 3 by Philippine armed
forces.

245. Respondent acknowledges that its taking physical possession of Terminal 3 in December
2004 was an expropriation, but argues that none of the prior actions constituted an
expropriation and that it did not expropriate either the concession agreements, which were
legally declared null and void, or Fraport’s investment in PIATCO”” which it retains as

shareholder and creditor.”°*

2. Respondent’s Defense of the Invalidation of the Terminal 3 Concession
Agreements

24

an

The central portion of Respondent’s substantive defense is its arguments that (i) its
executive branch and judiciary properly determined that the Terminal 3 concession
agreements were null and void ab initio, and (ii) Fraport was aware of these legal risks

when it invested.

As noted above, the Government determined that the Terminal 3 Concession was void due

e deviations from the original Bid documents, combined with the failure to
allow AEDC to match the terms of PIATCO’s bid, placed PIATCO in a more
favorable position than other project bidders, in contravention of the BOT
law:2

e the PAIRCARGO Consortium did not meet the financial qualifications at the
time the Concession was awarded.

248. In the Agan decision, the Supreme Court additionally relied on the following grounds in

finding the Terminal 3 concession to be void:

e Post-award modifications to the 1997 Concession Agreement provided
financial advantages to PIATCO that were not available during the bidding
process and required the Government to provide a “form of security” for loans
to PIATCO. Therefore, the Agreement was void as contrary to public policy.

e The ARCA provided for a direct guarantee by the Government, in the event of
PIATCO’s default, which was prohibited by the BOT law.

249. Respondent, relying on a legal opinion from former Associate Justice Vincente
Mendoza,””’ argues that the Agan decision (and the related conclusions by the DOJ), were
proper applications of Philippine law. Consequently, because the Concession was null and

void ab initio — that is, as a legal matter, never existed — it could not be expropriated.7”!

250. Furthermore, Respondent argues that Fraport knew or should have known of the existence

of the grounds for invalidating the Concession at the time it invested:

e Respondent claims that Fraport knew that PIATCO had “misrepresented its
qualifications” and “was not financially qualified.”

e Respondent argues that Fraport should have been aware that the 1997
Concession Agreement and the ARCA both contained an illegal Government

the original Bid documents.

guarantee in the event PIATCO defaults on its payments to the creditors
financing the Terminal 3 Project.7”

251. In response, Fraport takes issue with the reasoning in Agan, both as to the grounds for
invalidating the Concession and as to the remedy of declaring the Concession void ab
initio, relying on legal opinions from Professor Merlin Magallona. 273 According to

Professor Magallona:

e Negotiated contracts based on unsolicited BOT proposals (as is the case here)
and amendments thereto are not required to conform to public bidding
requirements.”

e The determination of whether the PAIRCARGO Consortium met the financial
pre-qualification requirements to bid on the Concession is within the

discretion of PBAC, which had already found that it did.?”>

e The BOT law does not prohibit certain Government guarantees; regardless,
the concession agreements do not carry such guarantees.””°

25

N

. According to Fraport, as confirmed by Professor Odoni, the terms of the Concession
Agreement, ARCA and the 3 Supplements were in line with modern airport practices and
did not place unwarranted or excessive burden on the Government.””” None of the
Governmental officials had considered that the ARCA was disadvantageous to the

Government at the time of the execution or afterwards.

25

ow

. Fraport also argues that it did not have knowledge of the alleged BOT violations that
served as grounds for voiding the Concession,” and, moreover, it relied on multiple,

repeated Government assurances of the legality of its investment and other expressions of

The other main issues of contention between the Parties related to the expropriation claims

are set out below.

3. Failure to Pay Compensation

Fraport asserts that Respondent’s failure to provide compensation for the physical taking
of the Terminal is not in accordance with the BIT, as much as for the amount than for the
delay in paying. Fraport was entitled to prompt compensation, the determination and the
payment of which were to be made at the time of the taking. In addition, through the MFN
clause in the BIT, it was entitled to “prompt, adequate and effective” compensation as

included in the Danish BIT, “without due delay.”*5!

Fraport complains that it has only received a “small fraction” of the compensation to which

it is due, US $29 million to date.

In the event of a government taking, Philippine law provides for initial payment of the
“proffered value” of the expropriated property. If the owner contests the amount of
compensation, a court is supposed to determine the additional amount due, if any, within

60 days.

Fraport argues that the Philippines made significant efforts to avoid payment of the
proffered value, refusing first to apply the correct law Act No. 8974 until the Supreme

Court ruled in the Gingoyon decision’ in December 2005 that Republic Act No. 8974

Rep. Act No. 8974 in several respects. Still, at least, the 4 January 2005 Order correctly reformed the most basic
premise of the case that Rep. Act No. 8974 governs the expropriation proceedings” (p. 55).

was the correct law to apply. That decision further directed the expropriation court to

determine just compensation within 60 days of the decision, i.e., by March 17, 2006.

The Philippines are said to have only made a proffered value payment of US $53 million to
PIATCO in September 2006 (US $29 million of which was transferred to Fraport) — 21
months after the acknowledged expropriation — after the ICC Tribunal threatened to require

Respondent to return Terminal 3 to PIATCO in August 2006.73

Fraport also argues that Respondent has repeatedly and successfully sought to delay the
proceedings in the expropriation court to determine the amount of compensation due."**
Despite findings by an independent board of commissioners appointed by the expropriation
court that the replacement cost of Terminal 3 was approximately US $376 million
(excluding interest at 12%), the expropriation court unreasonably determined the value to
be US $175 million (with no interest due), yet ultimately awarded compensation of only

US $149 million in May 2011.85

Moreover, Respondent has continued to contest the amount and conditions of the payment

of compensation to PIATCO,”*°

the Philippines placed US $116 million in an escrow
account in October 2011, which Fraport refers to as “shell game”**’ because the holding
banks are owned by Respondent and that the escrow agreements require approval of 3
conditions from Respondent’s executive branch before any money is released. The latest
decision ordering payment of US $300 million in August 2013 and confirmed in October

2013 will not be paid, as there is no final judgment of the Supreme Court yet.88

In any event, Fraport submits that the court unvalued the costs by excluding large parts of

the facility, such as the shopping facilities, excluding other facilities and improvement by

PIATCO and Takenaka, deducting costs for alleged deterioration and depreciation, not
including interest." The compensation model is also flawed as it is premised on a

“replacement cost,”

and fails to take into account (i) the investments made by Fraport
and other participants in the construction, and (ii) the right acquired by PLIATCO under the

: : 2
Concession to operate the Terminal and generate revenues.””!

. Fraport further argues that the compensation required under Philippine law — which the

Supreme Court has established in this case means payment of “replacement cost” — does
not meet the BIT standard for compensation, requiring at the minimum the fair market

value for the asset expropriated.”

Respondent responds that Fraport’s interests in PLATCO have not been deprived of all
their value.”? It has made the proffered value as required by Philippine law, which is
consistent with the requirements of international law, and that it maintains its commitment
to pay compensation as required by its courts. 24 Moreover, Respondent argues that
PIATCO and others — but not it — are responsible for the delays in the expropriation

proceedings, as set out at length in Annex E to its Counter-Memorial.””°

4. Public Purpose

. Fraport also argues that the expropriation was not for a public purpose; rather it was

motivated by President Arroyo’s alleged interest in developing a different international
airport (Clark; later, Diosdado Macapagal International Airport (“DMIA”)) in her home
province that she had named after her father (the development of which was restricted per

the Terminal 3 Concession Agreement), the effects of the Concession on allegedly favored

financial considerations.”°°

For Respondent, Clark was a non-issue. Respondent argues that Fraport’s investment in
the Terminal 3 Project was a commercial failure, in particular that Takenaka ceased
construction of Terminal 3 in November 2002 because of past-due invoices from PIATCO,

rather than President Arroyo’s decision not to honor the Concession.”*”

While commercial failure was not given as a reason for either the November 2002 decision
not to honor the Concession or the May 2003 Agan decision declaring the Concession
agreement null and void, Respondent argues (assuming the physical terminal was the only
asset expropriated) that the public purpose of the expropriation was to obtain a needed

298

terminal that PLATCO was unable to complete~”, and was carried with due process.”

B. Unfair and Inequitable Treatment

Fraport alleges that Respondent has subjected Fraport’s investments to unfair and
inequitable treatment in violation of Article 2(1) of the BIT through (1) contravention of
Fraport’s legitimate expectations, (2) acting in bad faith, (3) denial of justice, and (4)

acting without transparency.*°°

Respondent, as a general matter, argue that an investor who acts corruptly, in violation of
host State law, and fails to honor its obligations is not protected by the FET standard.*"' It

further contends that Fraport “chose an incompetent local partner with a bad reputation that

was engaged in corruption and that it made a series of bad business decision based on

faulty assumptions.

1. Legitimate Expectations

270. Fraport argues that Respondent contravened its legitimate expectations by “abruptly and
unjustifiably” reversing its long-standing support for Fraport’s investment in the Terminal
3 Project*™* and voiding the Concession when the Terminal was 98% complete.*°° Fraport
submits that its investment was sound and followed an extensive financial (with KPMG)

and legal (with QT) due diligence.**°

271. Among the bases that Fraport identifies for its expectation that the Government welcomed
the investment and would “honor its commitments” and continue to support the Terminal 3

Project are:

e Representations by Philippine authorities that the requirements of the
original bid process — including financial prequalification — had been duly
observed;?"”

e The warranty of validity contained in the ARCA;** and
e Memoranda of support from President Ramos and President Estrada.*”

272. Respondent responds that Fraport’s expectations were not legitimate because it knew the

10

Concession Agreement was legally defective.*'° Moreover, the ARCA warranty was

invalid because of deficiencies in the process for approving it and because it was declared

void ab initio and, thus, like the rest of the ARCA never existed as a legal matter.
Furthermore, Fraport could not rely on PBAC’s representations because they were made to
a third party, and not to its benefit, and, regardless, were made with allegedly-corrupt
official Pantaleon Alvarez’s involvement. Nor could it rely on the presidential
memoranda, which were directed at the Terminal 3 Project in general, rather than
PIATCO’s Concession or Fraport’s investment, and pre-dated knowledge of Fraport’s

alleged wrongdoing. aul

2. Bad Faith

. Fraport argues that Respondent has acted in bad faith by means of “coercion and

harassment” of Fraport’s officials and counsel, including:

e Fabricating charges of corruption against individuals associated with
Fraport, when no Philippine official has been charged;

e Reviving of baseless ADL charges after many years’ delay, in response to
the annulment of the ICSID 1 Award in order to manufacture a defense for
this arbitration;

e Persecuting Fraport’s local arbitration counsel with charges based on
statements made during the ICSID 1 arbitration;

e Attempting to coerce Fraport into renegotiating the terms of its investment,
demanding to oust the Chengs, and pretending to negotiate with Fraport in
good faith, via Secretary Climaco, while planning to seek the nullification of
the Concession;

e Misusing police and prosecutorial resources to harass Fraport and
manufacture a defense for this arbitration, rather that bona fide criminal

investigations;

e Failing to pay compensation due for the expropriation of Terminal 3;

3! C-Mem., paras. 933-935; R. PHB1, paras. 127-132.

83

e Mischaracterizing the failure of its requests of Germany for mutual legal
assistance to the ICSID | Tribunal, suggesting that Fraport was at fault and
had something to hide.*!

e And generally, “misusing its sovereign power by prosecuting Fraport’s
employees and international counsel for the express purpose of gaining an
advantage in the arbitration as well as Philippine counsel,”>!3

274. Fraport also claims that Respondent through Secretary Climaco treated Fraport unfairly

and inequitably.*'*
275. Respondent responds that:

e Its inability to achieve corruption convictions does not indicate that the
charges were fabricated and, in particular, it was hampered from using the
evidence available to it by confidentiality agreements from the first ICSID
proceedings and the ICC arbitration.

e The timing of ADL charges was dictated by private complainants and,
regardless, Fraport violated the ADL.

e The libel complaints were filed by private parties, whose actions cannot be
attributed to Respondent.

e Respondent did not mislead German authorities in its requests for mutual
legal assistance and, therefore, property characterized these requests to the
ICSID 1 Tribunal.

e  Fraport has not shown that Climaco was planning to seek nullification of the
concession, nor that it was bullied into terminating its investment, which it
lost because of its own illegality.

e Respondent has never denied its obligation to pay compensation due, once
properly determined.*!>

3. Denial of Justice

276. Fraport argues that the Supreme Court’s decision in Agan constitutes a procedural and
substantive denial of justice. It alleges that the proceedings suffered from the following

procedural infirmities:

e The Court had no basis for its exercise of jurisdiction. According to Fraport,
Section 2 of Rule 65 of the Philippine Rules of Court, relied upon by the
Agan petitioners, provides for the court to prohibit further proceedings,
which was not actually the relief sought (or ordered).

e Petitioners’ allegations rested upon issues of fact, whereas Rules 65 may
only be invoked to decide issues of law or grave abuses of discretion related
to the lack of jurisdiction.

e The Supreme Court decided, improperly and without any legal basis, that it
had original jurisdiction over the matter due to “extraordinary
circumstances,” when the validity of contracts are normally issues to be
addressed at the trial court level.

e The Supreme Court improperly decided to waive requirements of standing,
despite recognizing that the petitioners lacked standing to bring a case,

e President Arroyo publicly announced the decision not to honor the Terminal
3 Concession 10 days before oral arguments, thus improperly exerting
political pressure on the judiciary.*!°

277. Fraport further alleges that the Agan decision is substantively unjust for the following

reasons:

e The Court improperly reversed the DOTC Prequalification, Bids, and Award
Committee’s earlier determination that PLATCO was qualified to be awarded
the Terminal 3 Concession without extending it any deference, discussing
the factual circumstances considered, or articulating a standard of judicial
review to PBAC’s fact finding or application of the law to those facts, which
is inconsistent with the requirements of Philippine law.

e The Court failed to consider the doctrine of estoppel as applied to Fraport
and PIATCO’s reliance on the assurances of Philippine officials.”

S

N

Fraport further claims that failure to remit compensation for expropriation after nearly 11

years constitute a denial of justice.

Respondent responds both that Fraport’s allegations fail to rise to the level of denial of
justice and, regardless, the Agan proceedings and decision was proper, relying on Justice

se oninion 3
Mendoza’s opinion. 18

4. Lack of Transparency

Fraport argues that Respondent has failed to act transparently in withdrawing its support
for the Terminal 3 Project for improper and idiosyncratic reasons,*!” as well as by shifting
its legal positions on the validity of the concession agreements in a manner that Fraport

could not have predicted.*””

. Respondent responds that its withdrawal of support was due to the various legitimate

grounds that formed the basis for the DOJ’s position and the Agan decision. Similarly,
Fraport should have known of the Government’s interest in developing Clark
Airport/DMIA, which was referenced in the original Bid documents, and improperly

- . . 321
excluded the from Terminal 3 concession agreements.

C. Impairment by Arbitrary and Discriminatory Measures

Fraport alleges that Respondent’s reversal of support for the Terminal 3 Concession and
the changes of position in regard to the validity of the concession agreements,” followed
by the Agan decision also constituted impairment through arbitrary measures in breach of

Article 2(2) of the BIT.*? Fraport further alleges that the Government’s reversal of

support — motivated in part by a preference for local interests, including PAL and MASO —
and the digression from established procedural rules in Agan constituted impairment by

rs 324
discriminatory measures.

. It also alleges persecution and harassment by Respondent since the filing of the 2003 first

ICSID request for arbitration.*?°

Respondent argues that the complained of acts were proper — and, therefore, not arbitrary
or discriminatory, but grounded in law**° — for the same reasons discussed elsewhere.
Likewise, Fraport has also not shown that it was discriminated against because of its status

Fo naion j 327
as a foreign investor.

D. Failure to Afford Full Protection and Security

Fraport argues that Respondent had the objective obligation to afford full protection and
security under Article 4(1) of the BIT, and not to invoke its own legislation to detract from
such an obligation.*” Interference of the Executive with the Judiciary violates a State’s
obligation. Such an obligation applies to non-physical harm, such as economic and legal

protection, and to harm caused by the State itself.

For Respondent, to the extent that full protection and security would differ from FET, it
only applies to physical harm caused by a third party or to failure to provide legal
protection through domestic courts.” In this case, none of the acts complained of are due
to any alleged failure by Respondent to exercise due diligence to protect Fraport’s
investment against harm caused by a third party (domestic proceedings having been

initiated by private parties). It further contends that Fraport does not complain that the

Philippine judicial system was not available’, and while it could have, it declined to

participate in the Agan and the expropriation proceedings.

E. Breach of Umbrella Clause

Fraport further alleges that Respondent breached its obligation to honor the Terminal 3
concession agreements with PIATCO, which Fraport is entitled to see respected (as a
shareholder of PIATCO and based on its interest in the concession agreements) through the
umbrella clause under Article 3(5) of the BIT,** and should be estopped from denying the

validity of the agreements. **

Respondent argues that Fraport may not invoke the umbrella clause, as it was not a party to
the contracts at issue. Moreover, as a result of the Agan decision, there was no valid

contract for Respondent to observe.**4

As to estoppel, Respondent argues that it does not apply under either Philippine or

+ . 33:
international law. ***

Regardless, Respondent argues that it did not induce Fraport’s
investment and that any reliance on governmental representations were not reasonable,
because Fraport’s due diligence did or should have put it on notice of the legal problems

with the Terminal 3 Concession.**°

Respondent makes twelve separate counterclaims against Fraport,**” many premised on the
theory that the inability of Terminal 3 to become operational by the end of 2002 is
attributable to Fraport (or PLATCO):

Counterclaims Nos. 1 through 3 involve various costs associated with
completing or remediating aspects of Terminal 3 in accordance with the
original Bid documents.

Counterclaim No. 4 is for lease payments and real-estate taxes for the land
where Terminal 3 is located incurred by Respondent for which PIATCO
would have been responsible upon the Terminal becoming operational.

Counterclaim No. 5 is for the tax benefits that Fraport received from
Terminal 3’s Special Economic Zone status, which was intended to benefit
only “legitimate investment.”

Counterclaim No. 6 is for all costs associated with administering PIATCO’s
bid and the Concession, including costs associated with challenges to
PIATCO’s pre-qualification.

Counterclaims Nos. 7 and 8 are for lost revenue and other “economic and
social opportunities” caused by the failure of the Terminal to become
operational as of January 1999.

e Counterclaims No. 9 through 11 are for set-offs against any Award rendered
in favor of Fraport by (i) the amounts owed to Respondent under the above
counterclaims, (ii) the amount of bribes paid by Fraport, any fines or
penalties imposed by Philippine courts against Fraport, and the amount of
Fraport’s “ill-gotten gains,” and (iii) the amount of compensation awarded to
PIATCO by the Philippine expropriation court.

e Counterclaim No. 12 is a request for costs and legal expenses.

Respondent argues that the Parties consented to arbitrate the counterclaims under Article 9
of the BIT which refers to “all kinds of divergencies [...] concerning an investment,”*“°
and that that the close factual connection between the original claim and the counterclaims
make them arising directly out of the subject matter of the dispute for the purpose of

Arbitration Rule 40(1).*"!

Fraport, in response, argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over these counterclaims,
as it did not consent to arbitrate those counterclaims under the BIT which only extends to

directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, and arise only under Philippine law and
not the BIT.* It further considers that it is not the proper party against whom to bring the
counterclaims, that certain of the counterclaims are not properly counterclaims, that
Respondent is re-litigating claims it lost in the ICC arbitration against PIATCO, and that

all of the counterclaims fail on the merits.*“

JURISDICTION

A. Governing Law and Burden of Proof

. Having duly considered the Parties’ position regarding “governing law” and “burden of

proof”

the following principles shall be applied by the Tribunal in order to determine
whether it has jurisdiction, considering that only jurisdiction ratione materiae, not the one

ratione personae or ratione temporis, is in dispute.

In this case, there is no disagreement between the Parties with respect to the nationality of
the investor, or that, as a general matter, the BIT contains Respondent’s consent to the
submission of disputes over “investments” to ICSID arbitration. Respondent, however,
objects that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the dispute because Fraport allegedly acted

unlawfully in making and implementing its investment.

The notion of “investment” is central to the determination of jurisdiction ratione materiae.

Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly
out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent
subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that
State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the
dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have
given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.

In the absence of any definition of “investment” under the ICSID Convention, the BIT and
international law, as the law governing the BIT, assume relevance to establish jurisdiction

ratione materiae.
The BIT refers to “investment” in Article 1 (Definition of Terms) as follows:

For the purpose of this Agreement:

1. [T]he term “investment” shall mean any kind of asset accepted in
accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting
State, and more particularly, though not exclusively:

(a) movable and immovable property as well as other rights in rem, such as
mortgages, liens, ledges, usufructs and similar rights;

(b) shares of stocks and debentures of companies or interest in the property of
such companies;

(c) claims to money utilized for the purpose of creating an economic value or to

any performance having an economic value;

intellectual property rights, in particular copyrights, patents, utility-model

patents, registered designs, trade-marks, trade-names, trade and business

secrets, technical processes, know-how, and goodwill;

(e) business concessions conferred by law or under contact, including concessions
to search for, extracts or exploit natural resources;

(a

any alteration of the form in which assets are invested shall not affect their classification as
an investment [...].

In addition, the Tribunal shall apply provisions of Philippine law to the extent the latter
establishes conditions that are relevant for determining its jurisdiction, whether or not the

BIT makes reference to such provisions.

. Regarding burden of proof, in accordance with the well-established rule of onus probandi

incumbit actori, the burden of proof rests upon the party that is asserting affirmatively a
claim or defense.“ Thus, with respect to its objections to jurisdiction, Respondent bears
the burden of proving the validity of such objections. The Tribunal accepts that if
Respondent adduces evidence sufficient to present a prima facie case, Claimant must

347

produce rebuttal evidence,’ although Respondent retains the ultimate burden to prove its

jurisdictional objections.

B. The “Investment” under the BIT
1. The Parties’ Positions

1.1 Respondent’s Position

The essence of Respondent’s jurisdictional objections is that the BIT contains an explicit
or implicit requirement that the investor comply with the laws and regulations of the host
State with respect to its investment and that Fraport failed to do so. The BIT is limited in
its application to investments accepted in accordance with host State law. Since
Claimant’s investment was made in violation of the Philippine ADL and because its
investment was in an enterprise that had been awarded concession agreements in violation
of the Philippine BOT law, its investment falls outside of the BIT’s protection also as a

result of Fraport’s corruption and fraud.*8

. In essence, Respondent contends that Claimant’s investment was not “accepted” in

accordance with the laws of the Philippines under Article 1(1) of the BIT. Article 1(1)
defines an “investment” as “any kind of asset accepted in accordance with the respective
laws and regulations of either Contracting State [...].”. Therefore, according to Respondent
in order to benefit from the BIT’s protection Claimant must demonstrate that its investment

complied with Philippines law and regulations.**”

. According to Respondent, a legality restriction is provided by other provisions of the

Bir.*° Thus, with regard to “Promotion and Acceptance” of investments, Article 2(1)
provides that “[e]ach Contracting State shall promote as far as possible investments in its
territory [...] and admit such investments in accordance with its Constitution, laws and
regulations as referred to in Article 1 paragraph 1. [...]” Likewise, Article 3(3) provides
that each Contracting State shall apply the most favored nation treatment regarding

investments “which are made in accordance with the legislation of that Contracting State.”

an

specifically, as in Article 5(1) requiring the host State to guarantee free transfer of payment
regarding investments “which have been duly registered by its appropriate government
agencies if so required.” Additional references to legality requirements are contained in
the Protocol to the BIT, which “forms an integral part” of the BIT,*"! while other Articles
of the Protocol refer to registration requirements, which reference would be redundant if

Article 1(1) only referred to a registration regime as suggested by Claimant.**?

. According to Respondent, even if the BIT did not expressly require that investments

comply with host State law to qualify for treaty protection, the Tribunal should decline
jurisdiction on account of illegality of the investment. It refers to the legal opinion of
Professor Dolzer, who observes that the fundamental aim of the ICSID Convention “is to

353 so that “unlawful investment

promote the rule of law in the area of foreign investment
will not be enforced by an international tribunal even if the relevant BIT contains no clause
on domestic conformity.”**4 The same view is expressed by Professor Schreuer,**> another

legal expert for Respondent.

. In Respondent’s view, other tribunals have confirmed that claims based on illegal

investments cannot be protected even in the absence of a specific clause of the relevant
treaty requiring compliance with host State’s law. Reference is made by Respondent to
Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic, holding that “States cannot be deemed to offer access to
the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism to investments made in violation of their law,”
and to Hamester v. Ghana holding the same with reference to Phoenix. 356 Fraport’s

reference to EDF International and others v. Argentina is wrong since this case stands for

oS

the opposite proposition by holding that “the requirement of not having engaged in a

serious violation of the legal regime is a tacit condition inherent in every BIT [...77"

. Fraport’s argument that Article 1(1) does not create a legality requirement as it contains the
word “accepted” rather than “made”** is flawed as it assumes that an investment “made”
in violation of host State law can nevertheless be “accepted in accordance with the
respective laws and regulations” of that State.*°° Contrary to Fraport’s view that the object
and purpose of the BIT is “enshrined in its preamble,” having therefore regard to the

360

promotion of investment with no new barriers to BIT protection,”” the promotion of

investment in such object and purpose must consider the entirety of the BIT provisions.**!

In conclusion, since according to Respondent Article 1(1) requires covered investments to
comply with host State law, the Tribunal should decline jurisdiction over Claimant’s
claims because “Fraport’s investment was a violation of the Philippine Anti-Dummy Law
and was an investment in an enterprise that obtained its concession in violation of the

Philippine law.”*°?

1.2. Claimant’s Position

. According to Claimant, contrary to Respondent’s afterthought argument contrived to evade
its compensation obligations, the investments made by it meet at all times the requirements
of the BIT, are legal under Philippine law and were accepted, indeed encouraged, by the

Philippine Government.*

. According to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the

“VCLT”), to which both Germany and the Philippines are parties, Article 1(1) of the BIT

must be interpreted “in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to

the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.”°4

The ordinary meaning of the term “accepted,” when modified by “in accordance with the
respective laws and regulations,” means permission to the Philippines to put in place laws
and regulations to regulate its acceptance of assets as investments.** This meaning is
consistent with the object and purpose of the BIT, which is the encouragement and
protection of investments, as made clear by the Preamble.* It is also consistent with the
context of the BIT, which provides for specific narrow reservation in the Protocol that did

not apply to Claimant’s investment.”

. Other articles of the BIT confirm that Ad Article 1(1) is concerned only with the admission

of investments, such as Article 2(1) which was included at the instigation of the German
Government to reflect that all investments that have been admitted are protected
investments.** Likewise, Article 5(a) of the Protocol expressly envisages an acceptance
and registration regime by providing that “it is understood that duly registered investments
are assets of any kind as defined in Article 1, admitted in accordance with Article 2(1) and

reported to competent governmental agencies at the time the investment was made.”°°

An acceptance regime is provided by other treaties concluded by the Philippines using the

same wording of Article 1 of the BIT, such as the Italy-Philippines BiT.*”

By contrast,
other treaties concluded by the Philippines expressly provide for the requirement of

compliance with Philippine law as a condition to jurisdiction.*”!

Also the travaux préparatoires, considered by Respondent to be “often unreliable,”>””

confirm that the treaty language of Article 1(1) was meant to be an admittance
requirement, not a legality requirement, as shown by the exchange of Notes Verbale (sic)

between the two Governments in the course of 1995.°7°

Respondent’s attempt to read into the BIT a legality requirement that is not there has been
rejected by other tribunals, for example, in EDF International and others v. Argentina
where the tribunal agreed with the claimant that where a BIT does not explicitly provide
that an investment must be made “in accordance with the laws” of the host State no

legality clause may be read into the treaty for purpose of admission of an investment.*4

. Neither of the cases referred to by Respondent dealt with provisions similar to or relevant

for an interpretation of the meaning of Article 1(1) of the BIT.*”5

. According to Claimant, the only possible requirement that may be imposed on an investor

for purposes of jurisdiction is that its investment “is reported to competent governmental

agencies” at the time it is made, as provided by Ad Article 5(a) of the BIT Protocol.>”°

Article 3(3) of the BIT imposes on the investors rather than the Contracting State an
obligation of conformity with the host State’s legislation of investments made by them as a
condition for an investor to be eligible for MFN treatment. According to Claimant, this
position is instructive for two reasons. First, because it confirms the conscious use of the
word “accepted” instead of “made” in Article 1(1), which is instrumental to its
interpretation. Second, since the legality of the investment is required for the MFN

protection this means that in any other respects protection of the treaty is granted if the

investment is acceptes Article 8 of the BIT provides confirming context when

requiring conformity with host State’s legislation only for BIT protection of “investments
made prior to its entry into force.”>78

In conclusion, Claimant contends that an investment will not receive the BIT protection
under Article 1(1) either if it was not accepted by the host State or if the State’s acceptance
was not in accordance with its “respective laws and regulations.” This is not the case in
the present dispute considering that Claimant’s investments “were accepted by the highest

levels of the Philippine Government”*”

and that such acceptance was in accordance with
all relevant laws and regulations, considering that Respondent does not impose specific
admittance or registration requirements on investments in shares or in the form of loans or

guarantees.”**?

2. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The overview of the Parties’ position regarding the issue of jurisdiction conducted so far,
although not meant to be exhaustive of the respective arguments, is sufficient to evidence
their fundamental disagreement on the scope of Article 1(1) of the BIT and the

consequence for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

. According to Claimant, Article 1(1) was intended by both parties to the Treaty to be an

admittance clause, with the consequence that since its investments had complied with any
registration or admission requirement under the laws and regulations of the Philippines, the

Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the case.**!

According to Respondent, Article 1(1) is a
legality requirement, with the consequence that since Claimant’s investment were made in
violations of the host State’s law the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae should

such violation be established.

321. Turning to Article 1(1) of the BIT, which is at the core of the Parties’ disagreement, the

32!

32)

32:

N

o

&

Tribunal’s analysis must be conducted applying the rules for treaty interpretation under the

VCLT. According to Article 31(1) of the VCLT

A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light
of its object and purpose.

Article 1(1) of the BIT provides, in relevant part, that “the term ‘investment’ shall mean
any kind of asset accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either

Contracting State [...]”

. Regarding the “ordinary meaning” of the term “accepted” in Article 1(1), the Tribunal

concurs with Respondent’s reference to the meaning of the term according to the Oxford
Dictionary as “satisfactory,” “acceptable” and “generally recognized as correct or
valid.”?*? However, any forms of acceptance, to be valid, must be “in accordance with the
laws and regulations” of the host State and this supports the interpretation of Article 1(1)
favoring the requirement that investments, to be accepted, must comply with the host
State’s law. In other words, the reading of the whole sentence in Article 1(1) legitimates
the interpretation that is not the act of acceptance that has to conform to the host State’s

law but that the investment to be accepted must comply with such law.

. Regarding the “context,” other provisions of the BIT confirm the legality requirement for

an investment to be accorded the BIT protection. Thus, Article 2(1) provides that each
Contracting State, in addition to promoting investments in its territory, shall admit them
“in accordance with its Constitution, laws and regulations, as referred to in Article 1

paragraph 1.” Once again, to admit investments in accordance with the Constitution, laws

Particularly in the case, like the present one, where the host State has no specific rules governing the
acceptance (in the sense of admission) of foreign investments.

and regulations may only be interpreted to mean that investments, to be admitted to the

BIT protection, must conform to the host State’s law.?**

. Reference to investments “made in accordance with” or “consistent with” the host State’s

legislation is made by Article 3(3) and Article 8 of the BIT, respectively to grant MFN
treatment to investment and to extend the BIT protection also to investments made prior to
the BIT entry into force. Requiring compliance with host State’s law only limited to these
two situations may be hardly reconciled with the repeated references in the BIT to the host
State’s law, pointing rather to a general requirement of compliance with such law for an

investment to be accorded the BIT protection.

As mentioned by Respondent, investment registration is expressly required by the BIT in
certain cases. This is the case of Article 5(1) for the “guarantee of free transfer of
payments in connection with investments.” This is also the case of Ad Article 5(a) of the
Protocol defining, which are duly registered investments for the Philippines. In the
Tribunal’s view, nothing would have prevented the Contracting States from using the same

language in Article 1(1), had they intended that provision to be an admittance clause.

The Tribunal also refers to the Philippines’ Instrument of Ratification to the BIT, which
the Tribunal considers both States to have accepted “as an instrument related to the treaty”
in the Protocol of Exchange of the Instruments of Ratifications of the BIT, and which
therefore constitutes part of the “context” under Article 31(2)(b) of the VCLT. With
relative clarity, that Instrument of Ratification states that the “Agreement shall be in areas
allowed by and in accordance with the Constitution, laws and regulations of each of the

Contracting Parties.”**

. Investment treaty cases confirm that such treaties do not afford protection to illegal

investments either based on clauses of the treaties, as in the present case according to the

above analysis, or, absent an express provision in the treaty, based on rules of international

54 Considering also that a State’s Constitution does not normally regulates the process of admission of
investments in its territory, as it is the case of the Philippine Constitution (CBII-6).

law, such as the “clean hands” doctrine*** or doctrines to the same effect.*®” One of the
first cases having ruled on this issue, Inceysa v. El Salvador, has held that “because
Inceysa’s investment was made in a manner that was clearly illegal, it is not included in the
scope of consent expressed by Spain and the Republic of El Salvador in the BIT and,
consequently, the disputes arising from it are not subject to the jurisdiction of the

Centre.”**

. Cognizant that the good faith interpretation of a treaty encompasses the principle of effet
utile, however, the Tribunal does not regard it as appropriate to treat the term “accepted” as
surplusage. Rather, recalling that the ordinary meaning of the term “accepted” includes

“received,” the Tribunal considers that “accepted” refers to the point in time when the

under the ICSID/BIT system. These are illegal investments according to the national law of the host Stat and
cannot be protected through an ICSID arbitral process. And it is the Tribunal’s view that this condition — the
conformity of the establishment of the investment with the national laws — is implicit even when not expressly
stated in the relevant BIT”;

 

Hamester, Award, paras. 123-124: “An investment will not be protected if it has been created in violation of
national or international principles of good faith; by way of corruption, fraud, or deceitful conduct; or if its
creation itself constitutes a misuse of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID
Convention. It will also not be protected if it is made in violation of the host State’s law (as elaborated, e.g. by
the tribunal in Phoenix). These are general principles that exist independently of specific language to this effect
in the Treaty”; and

investment is received in the host State, or, in other words, at the time the investment is

made.

This understanding is supported by the use of the term “‘zugelassen sind” in the German
text of Article 1(1).**? As Claimant explained, “zugelassen sind” is the passive participle
of the verb “zulassen,” meaning “to “accept” or “to admit.”?°° Thus, the German text is, at
the very least, consistent with the Tribunal’s view that Article 1(1) refers to the admission
of the investment, a well-known concept in international investment law. Indeed, the
English text of the BIT also does not clearly differentiate between acceptance and
admission. While Article 2 of the BIT is entitled “Promotion and Acceptance,” the text of
Article 2(1) refers instead to the “promot[ion]” and “admi[ssion]” of investments. In the
German version of Article 2, the references to both “[a]cceptance” and “admi[ssion]” use

forms of the verb “‘zulassen,” the same term used for “accepted” in Article 1(1).

. For these reasons, the Tribunal disagrees with Claimant’s contentions that the phrase

“accepted in accordance with the [host State’s] laws and regulations,” as used in Article
1(1), simply contemplates a potential regime for regulation of the admission of foreign
investment. Rather, the Tribunal finds that the use of this phrase limits the scope of
“investment” in the BIT to investments that were lawful under (i.e., “in accordance with”)

the host State’s laws and regulation at the time the investments were made.

The Tribunal is also of the view that, even absent the sort of explicit legality requirement
that exists here, it would be still be appropriate to consider the legality of the investment.
As other tribunals have recognized, there is an increasingly well-established international
principle which makes international legal remedies unavailable with respect to illegal

investments, at least when such illegality goes to the essence of the investment.*”!

in the case of conflict, the English text prevails.

102

333. In light of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal concludes that Article 1(1) of the BIT
requires that an investment comply with the laws of the host State at the time it is made in
order to be accorded protection under the BIT. The Tribunal’s assessment of Respondent’s

jurisdictional objections will therefore focus on the time of entry of Claimant’s investment.

. Based on the foregoing conclusion regarding the requirement of legality of investments to
found the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae, the Tribunal shall now proceed to
analyze the Parties’ arguments regarding Respondent’s jurisdictional objections. Before

doing so, the following issues have to be determined, namely

(a) which of Claimant’s “investments” are to be considered for jurisdictional
purposes;

(b) which are Respondent’s jurisdictional objections.
335. Regarding issue (a), according to Claimant’s most recent submission on the subject

Fraport’s investments in the NAIA 1PT 3 Project span a period of several
years, from 1999 and ending in 2002-2203. A report prepared by
PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PWC”) and submitted with the Memorial set forth
the investment made by Fraport per years. Fraport made several types of
investments, as defined under Article 1 of the BIT. The BIT states that
investments include “shares of stock and debentures of companies or interest
in the property of such companies”. Fraport’s investments include (1) equity
investments in PIATCO and in a “cascade” of Philippine companies that have
ownership interests in PIATCO; (2) loans to PIATCO and the cascade
companies; (3) payments to Takenaka and the Project lenders specifically for
the construction of the Terminal (resulting, inter alia, in subrogation rights);
and (4) services rendered. Fraport’s investments also include Fraport’s

protection, a agi 4 l’encontre du droit” (translated in Schreuer-Kriebaum-Binder I (ICSID 2), fn. 81 as “The
condition of not committing a grave violation of the legal order is a tacit condition of any BIT, because in any
event it is incomprehensible that a State would offer the benefit of protection through investment arbitration if the
investor, in order to obtain such protection, has acted contrary to the law”).

interest both in the concession and the Terminal building itself, as these
constitute “interest in the property” of PIATCO.*

The list of investments indicated by Claimant being not disputed by Respondent, the

Tribunal shall consider that Claimant’s investments are so identified.

336. Regarding issue (b), based on Respondent’s most recent submission on the subject, three

objections are raised regarding jurisdiction and admissibility by reason of Fraport’s

393

violation of Philippine law in the making and/or implementation of its investment:

 

(i) Fraport violated the Anti-Dummy Law 304 (hereinafter “Jurisdictional
Objection 1”);

(ii) Fraport engaged in Corruption and Fraud 395

Objection 2”);

(hereinafter “Jurisdictional

(iii) Fraport knew of PIATCO’s Misrepresentations to obtain the Concession
Award*”° (hereinafter “Jurisdictional Objection 3”).

337. At the jurisdictional level, the Tribunal’s analysis shall be limited to those of Respondent’s
objections that relate to the period of time until when Fraport made initially its investments

as identified above, i.e. “the equity investments in PIATCO and in a ‘cascade’ of

worded its questions within the meaning of Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention regarding jurisdiction and
admissibility as follows:

Question | Does the BIT require a covered investor to comply with host State law in making, acquiring, or
implementing its investment? Does the ICSID Convention apply to disputes arising directly out
of an investment made, acquired, or implemented unlawfully?

Question 2. Did Fraport violate Philippine Nationality laws and/or the Anti-Dummy Law in making,
acquiring, or implementing its investment in the Philippines?

Question 3. Did Fraport make, acquire, or implement its investment by participating in corrupt and/or
fraudulent schemes?

Question 4 Was Fraport’s investment made, acquired, or implemented in reliance on a concession that was
obtained by its local partner through fraudulent misrepresentations?

Question 5 Does this ICSID Tribunal have jurisdiction over Fraport’s claims?

Question 6 Are Fraport’s claims inadmissible?

Claimant’ s questions to the Tribunal within the same meaning are set out in C. PHB1, Chapter IX.

Philippine companies that have ownership interests in PIATCO”*”” as well as those of
Fraport’s other investments that are contemporaneous with said equity investment*”® or
that derive indirectly from the initial “equity investment in PIATCO” 5 (all these
investments being hereinafter collectively referred to as “Initial Investment’). Due to the
contemporaneity and interdependence of the individual investments, the Initial Investment

is to be considered as a unit, despite its different components.

. In the Tribunal’s view, the essence of Fraport’s investment was its interest in the Terminal

3 Concession. Indeed, the objective of Fraport’s Initial Investment in mid-1999 was to
gain an interest in the Terminal 3 Concession initially and, later, to keep the Terminal 3
Project afloat. With its initial equity investments, Fraport obtained a bundle of rights in the
Terminal 3 Concession (including in PIATCO, the concession company) which cannot be
disentangled from each other. Fraport’s subsequent investments were all dependent upon
and ancillary to these initial rights, which remained materially unchanged as a result of the

Jater-in-time loans, payments, and so forth.

2. Jurisdictional Objection 1: Fraport Violated the Anti-Dummy Law

2.1 Introduction to the Anti-Dummy Law

The Philippine Constitution restricts operation of a public utility (which the Parties agree
includes Terminal 3) to Philippine citizens or corporations established under Philippine
law of which at least 60% of whose capital is owned by Philippine citizens. Specifically,

Article XII, Section 11 provides that:

No franchise, certificate, or any other form of authorization for the operation
of a public utility shall be granted except to citizens of the Philippines or to
corporations or associations organized under the laws of the Philippines at
least sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such citizens. [...] The
participation of foreign investors in the governing body of any public utility

enterprise shall be limited to their proportionate share in its capital, and all the
executive and managing officers of such corporation or association must be
citizens of the Philippines.*°

The Anti-Dummy Law*”! was originally enacted in 1936 and subsequently amended on
multiple occasions. Formally titled “An Act to Punish Acts of Evasion of the Laws on the
Nationalization of Certain Rights Franchises or Privileges,” the ADL is designed to
prevent circumvention of the constitutional and statutory nationality restrictions. Section 1
of the ADL establishes penalties for the violation of such nationality restrictions. Section 2

prohibits falsely simulating compliance with the minimum capital stock requirements.

2.2 The Parties’ Arguments

a) Respondent’s Position

. According to Respondent, on July 6, 1999, Fraport made its investment in a manner that

violated the ADL and the Philippine Constitution by acquiring shares in PIATCO and the
“cascade companies” while simultaneously establishing binding arrangements designed to
ensure that Fraport could intervene in the management, operation, administration and
control of PIATCO and PTI. This, through a series of contemporary agreements, including
the Pooling Agreement and other agreements with PIATCO’s other shareholders and an
interest-free Loan Agreement with PAGS, one of PIATCO’s shareholders. This, despite
warning by the Philippine law firm of Quisumbing Torres (“QT”) as early as January 1999
that “in view of the Anti-Dummy Law and provisions of the Philippine Constitution
arrangements, other than mere equity investments between FAG [i.e., Fraport] and the

Company [i.e., PLATCO], must be considered carefully.”4

Fraport’s top executives were fully aware that the manner in which Fraport was structuring
its investment violated the ADL, as shown by a “Final Holding Report” of February 26,

1999, shared with its Supervisory Board. The Report detailed a plan to execute a series of

4 CBII-6, 1987 Constitution of the Philippines.
“°" CBII-4, Commonwealth Act No. 108, Oct. 30, 1936.

agreements through which Fraport would have financial and operating control over the
Terminal 3 Project, noting the availability of the Philippine shareholders of PIATCO to
accept Fraport’s advice as “binding” while admitting that this arrangement “cannot be

enforced legally because of local laws.”

34)

oO

. Despite knowing that its investment structure violated the Constitution and the ADL,
Fraport proceeded to implement this unlawful scheme since the only way to ensure that the
Project would be profitable was to secretly secure its management control.“ At least

secret nature of the arrangements with the other shareholders of PLATCO, Respondent
could not know whether Fraport’s investment was consistent with Philippine law until

most of the 1999 agreements were produced few weeks before the oral hearing in ICSID
1,49

344. The provisions of the Constitution and the ADL on nationality restrictions regarding public
utility projects, like NAIA Terminal 3 Project, “are of great national significance as an
expression of fundamental national economic and policy goals.“ The Constitutional
nationality restrictions provide that (a) a foreign entity may not own more than 40% of a
corporation authorized to operate a public utility, (b) a foreign investor may participate in
the governing body of a public utility up to its proportionate share in capital and (c) all
executive and managing officers of the corporation authorized to operate a public utility

must be Philippine citizens.*°°

34

an

. Section 2-A of the ADL contains two sets of prohibitions, one applicable only to
Philippine entities and the other to “any person,” including non-Philippine entities. The

former entities that control a business reserved to corporations that are 60% owned by

Philippine citizens are prohibited permitting or allowing an unqualified person from
intervening “in the management operation, administration or control of the right or
franchise” held by the corporation. The non-Philippine entities are prohibited “from
intervening in the management, operation, administration, or control of a public utility”
and any such person “who knowingly aids, assists, or abets in the planning, consummation
or perpetration of any of the prohibited acts listed above is subject to criminal and civil

sanctions.“

. The most significant of the 1999 shareholders agreements showing how Fraport intervened

in PIATCO and PTI in violation of the ADL is the Pooling Agreement by which control
over the Terminal 3 operations, maintenance and management was achieved by Fraport
through a block voting arrangement providing that in case of failure to reach unanimity the
shareholders were required to “act upon the recommendation of FAG” [i.e., Fraport] in

matters related to “the implementation of the O&M Agreement,” “the operation,

maintenance and management of the Terminal” and “the conduct of commercial operations
within the Terminal Complex in the ordinary course of business.’*!°

Claimant’s reading of the reference in the Pooling Agreement that the other shareholders
“shall thereafter act upon the recommendation of FAG” as non-binding"! is not credible,
considering the mandatory character of the world “shall,” as confirmed by the Philippine

412

Supreme Court.” All the evidence shows that Fraport fully intended to control the votes

of 51% of PIATCO by requiring Philippine shareholders to follow its binding vote, this

being the only reasonable understanding of the effect of the Pooling Agreement.*"

Fraport’s Internal communications after signing the Pooling Agreement, including an

email from Dr. Stiller to Fraport in October 2000, indicate Fraport’s knowledge that

So

according to QT “the pooling of voting rights of certain shareholders [...] is incompatible

with the anti-dummy law.4"4

. According to Dean Concepcion, the language of the Pooling Agreement requiring 51% of

the share capital to vote as a block and upon Fraport’s recommendations and stating that
nominees or representatives who do not comply with the Pooling Agreement are
immediately replaced shows that “PIATCO [...] permitted Fraport to intervene in its
management, administration and control and that Fraport did so in violation of Section 2-

415
A.

. Both the ICC Tribunal and the ICSID | Tribunal reached the same conclusion.*"° Relying

on a QT’s letter of June 14, 1999, produced for the first time in this arbitration, Fraport
argues that the language of Article 2.02(2)(a) of the Pooling Agreement was suggested by
the local counsel. However, in October 2000 and on May 30, 2001, QT communicated

7

exactly the contrary. 417 The other agreements of July 1999 reinforce Fraport’s

management and control of PLATCO in violation of Section 2-A of the ADL.“

. According to one of the agreements of July 7, 1999, the Memorandum of Agreement with

FAG, PTI and PIATCO, Fraport was given the lead role in obtaining international
financing for the Project. According to the First Addendum to the PIATCO’s
Shareholders’ Agreement of July 6, 1999, this role was confirmed with “the exclusive
authority to determine the financial arrangements for the Project,” including nomination of

the company’s financial advisers.*"°

Fraport thus was not merely a financial adviser or consultant but had a central role in the
management, administration and control of PIATCO.”° This role as Finance Arranger
was consistently recognized to Fraport by the other shareholders and PIATCO’s President,

Cheng Yong.

. In addition to its role as finance arranger, Fraport infused further equity, loans and

guarantees to finance the entire Project. The first loan was made to the Chengs on July 6,
1999 to permit them to increase the share subscription by lending US $6.655.000 interest
free, to be repaid out of dividends generated by the Project and secured by the shares in
PIATCO.*! Fraport provided PIATCO with over US $50 million in loans, guaranteed
another US$ 165 million in loans and provided over US $120 million in guarantees to the

EPC contractors.“

Several legal opinions by QT and others confirmed that Fraport’s role as Financial
Arranger would violate the ADL. As indicated by Dean Concepcion, one of the indicators
of dummyship is the fact that the foreign shareholder provides practically all the funds for

the investment in a Philippine public utility with a local partner.“

As mentioned by Dean
Concepcion, “the pervasive financial control over Terminal 3 Project that was willingly
ceded to Fraport by PIATCO and the cascade companies shows that PIATCO and Fraport
planned and executed a dummy relationship in violation of Section 2-A of the Anti-

Dummy Law.”"4

Fraport was aware as early as 1999 that the Philippine Constitution required that all
executives and managing officers of a public utility corporation or association must be
Philippines and that the ADL prohibits all interventions into management, operation,
administration and control of a public utility, except for technical personnel as authorized

by the Secretary of Justice.

356. Fraport argues that its role as financial arranger was later “clarified” by a Special
Shareholders Meeting Resolution in June 2001 noting that Fraport’s role was to make
recommendations to PIATCO regarding financing.*?° Even if so, ADL violations cannot
in any case be cured. As noted by a DOJ Opinion, an ADL violation exists where a
foreign national provides “practically all the funding” for a project, as it occurred in the

present case,"6

. Pursuant to July 6, 1999 Shareholders Agreement (the “PTI Shareholders Agreement”)
Fraport and PTH became shareholders of a newly created company, PTI, which would
serve as the Contractor-Operator for the Terminal 3 Project. Fraport would have actual
control over the operation and management of the Terminal through PTI. The PTI
Shareholders Agreement ensured that Fraport would have ultimate decision-making

authority in relation to Terminal-operations, a role that was relinquished by PIATCO.*?”

35

oe

The PTI Shareholders Agreement gave Fraport the authority to designate PTI Chairman
and its Director in charge of finance, administration and commercial operation, the
agreement permitting the Director of Finance to sign checks on behalf of PTI. In addition,
Fraport placed foreign officials into key management positions. As noted by the minute of
the PIATCO Board meeting of July 8, 1999, one of Fraport’s representatives was
appointed as Director for Terminal Operations, Building Management & Personnel
Affairs, another as Director of Finance, Administration and Commercial Operations.
Messrs. Struck, Bauchspiess and Vogel had authority to sign banking documents on behalf

of PIATCO.**8

Fraport’s claim that PIATCO’s status as a company registered under the Philippine
Economic Zone Authority (“PEZA”) law exempted PIATCO and PTI from the ADL

prohibition of employment of foreign nationals is mistaken. The PEZA law cannot

derogate to the Constitution and its implementing regulations require compliance with

nationality restrictions and the ADL.*”?

The PTI Shareholders Agreement provides that virtually all corporate decisions required a
75% vote of PTI’s shareholders, granting therefore a veto power to Fraport. This was, in
addition to the requirement that at least one director nominated by Fraport was necessary to
approve a corporate act of PTI.**° All these arrangements as to PTI were held by lenders’
counsel to be a violation of the ADL, requiring amendment of the supermajority provision.
Violation of the ADL was confirmed also by Dean Concepcion: “Fraport planned and
obtained ability to control PTI as terminal operator, and thereby violated the Anti-Dummy

Law.”3!

. Under the Constitution, “the participation of foreign investors in the governing body of any

public utility enterprise shall be limited to their proportionate share in its capital.” The
ADL provides substantially the same.**? The allowable participation by a foreign minority
shareholding is based on the actual shareholders. As holder of a 25% share participation in
PIATCO, Fraport was entitled to appoint two directors to the PIATCO’s Board and one of
PTI’s designated directors to the same Board through its share participation to PTI. In
May 2001, the number of PIATCO’s directors was increased from eleven to thirteen and
their allocation changed pursuant to the Second Addendum to PIATCO’s Shareholders
Agreement. Having increased its shareholding to 30%, Fraport could nominate four
directors plus two thanks to its participation to PTI. The total of six was equal to 46,15%
of PIATCO’s Board, meaning that foreign investors controlled a majority of PLATCO’s

Board, seven out thirteen, since also Nissho Iwai was entitled to appoint one director. This

Fraport’s contention that its representation on the PIATCO’s Board has always been

PTI and contradicts the requirement under the Pooling Agreement that PTI’s directors vote

. It is not true that, as stated by Claimant, there cannot be a violation of Section 2-A of the

ADL absent “an actual act of intervention in the management, administration, operation or
control of a public utility that a Philippine national intentionally permitted.” According to

Dean Concepcion, this argument “is plainly contrary to the language of Section Arts

Claimant’s argument that the language of Section 2-A does not prohibit conduct by
shareholders, fails to consider that Section 2-A “prohibits any person, i.e. including any
non-Philippine citizen, from intervening in the management, operation, administration or
control of a public utility” and that violations of the ADL “are not restricted to the means

A”*®? Also Claimant’s

of alien control that are specifically mentioned in Section 2-
argument that it is not possible for a minority shareholder to intervene in the management,
operation, administration or control of a public utility fails to consider that even where the
equity ownership complies with the 40% limit on foreign shareholding the latter may enter

into arrangements in violation of the ADL.*°

counsel in structuring its investment and that it cured the ADL violations by amending the
disputed shareholders agreement two years later, when most of its investments was
made, “' does not absolve it of liability for ADL violations. As explained by Dean
Concepcion, under Philippine law there is no good faith defense to an ADL violation and

the latter cannot be cured by subsequent action. ”?

Respondent asserts that an ADL violation arose at the moment that Fraport planned and
executed the Pooling Agreement even if Fraport did not exercise its right of control under
Section 2.02. As concluded by a DOJ Opinion, it is sufficient that a minority foreign
shareholder places itself in a position to intervene in the management, operation,
administration or control of an entity subject to nationality restrictions.“ Further, the
planning of a violation of the ADL is prohibited by Section 2-A, as indicated by the

language of that provision referring to “planning.”*4

. Regarding PTI, Fraport’s argument that the ADL does not apply to PTI since the latter is

only a future operator is mistaken since the prohibition of the ADL apply from the time
a corporation applies for the right to operate a public utility which, in the case of PTI,
occurred when it applied to become contractor—operator for the Terminal 3 Project.

Fraport was advised by QT that PTI was subject to the ADL.“*°

Any alleged advice of local counsel did not immunize Fraport from the ADL violations,
contrary to Claimant’s contention that its “extensive communications with lawyers
demonstrate its efforts to comply with the ADL and that the Pooling Agreement was

drafted in consultation with QT.” Good faith is not a defense to any ADL violations

since they are mala prohibita and do not require proof of malicious intent.“ Fraport’s
selective disclosure of requested documents and the incomplete nature of the record cast
serious doubts on Fraport’s claims that it followed advice from local counsel. Further, QT
has rejected any suggestion that it drafted the Pooling Agreement, reconfirming in July
2001 that the Pooling Agreement had “Anti-Dummy implications and may be void under

Philippine law.”*””

b) —_Claimant’s Position

Fraport’s acquisition of shares in PIATCO, PTI, PTH and PAGS was made in accordance
with the foreign ownership restrictions under the Philippine Constitution which require that
at least 60% of the capital of corporations engaged in the operation of a public utility be
owned by Philippine nationals.*° At all relevant times Philippine nationals owned at least
60% of the shares in PIATCO, Fraport owning initially, in 1999, 25% and later on, since
2000, 30% of the shares in PIATCO.*”! As set forth in the Joint Legal Opinion of Justices
Melo, Tuquero and Dean Pangalangan, PIATCO’s shareholder structure was in full

compliance with Philippine law.*?

Being also a minority shareholder of the “cascade companies” that own shares in PIATCO,
Fraport has economic participation in PIATCO greater than 40%. This however is not in
violation of Philippine law since under the Control Test a public utility corporation is
considered to be of Philippine nationality if its shares are at least 60% owned by Philippine

453

nationals,” all cascade companies in which Fraport had a minority interest counting as

Philippine nationals.

of the ICSID 1 Tribunal held Fraport’s investments to have been made in violation of the
ADL based on a 1999 Shareholders Agreement, particularly Section 2.02 of the Pooling
Agreement, although neither member of such majority was an expert in Philippine law,

citing only one DOJ Opinion not even part of the record.***

To find a violation of Section 2-A of the ADL there must be an actual act of intervention in
the management, administration, operation or control of a public utility that a Philippine

455

national intentionally permitted.“ There is no evidence of such intervention. “Placing

itself in a position to intervene,” as stated by Dean Concepcion, **° is an impermissible

extension of the requirement of actual intervention.**”

Under Article 2.02 of the Pooling Agreement, Fraport had the right to make
recommendations to PIATCO’s other shareholders but recommendations are not
obligatory, being only an “advice” or an “exhortation.” Also the phrase “shall act upon”
does not require the other shareholders to accept Fraport’s recommendation but only “to
take an action, to do something as opposed to not doing anything.”*** The language of this
provision of the Pooling Agreement was drafted in consultation with the local counsel

agreement be illegal, such as a violation of the ADL under Philippine law, the directors

should refrain from implementing it to avoid their responsibility.*°!

. The statutory requirement is that the intervention in violation of the ADL is committed by

a non-qualifying national, as “an employee, officer or laborer,” this being the express
language of the ADL. The term “shareholder” is nowhere mentioned in the provisions of
the ADL. Fraport could not have violated the ADL in its capacity as a shareholder. The
majority of the ICSID 1 Tribunal was not authorized to extend the application of a criminal
Jaw in violation of the principle of nullum crimen sine lege. Under Philippine law
shareholders agreements are not binding on the Board of Directors, which is why the law
incriminates an intervention by an “officer, employee or laborer,’ not by a

“shareholder.”“

The Pooling Agreement was entered into on July 6, 1999, simultaneously with Fraport’s
initial acquisition of shares in PIATCO and the cascade companies. It was replaced by an
August 23, 2001 Amended and Restated Pooling Agreement which would have governed
PIATCO shareholders’ relations during the operative stage had the Government allowed

Court’s decision in the Gamboa Resolution, the amendment cures any prior violations, if

any existed, if changes are made prior to the beginning of an investigation.“

None of Fraport’s signatories of the original 1999 Shareholders Agreements were ever
charged of any ADL violation. Individuals who entered the scene after said Agreements
had been revised in a manner that Respondent concedes made them compliant with the
ADL were included as respondents in proceedings that have been pending for almost 10

years.“ None of the lenders’ counsel opinions referred to by Respondent was produced

by it. It is not surprising that such opinions differed from those of Fraport’s counsel since

is known that lenders take conservative approaches on legal and business issues.“

Respondent’s allegation that Fraport had management and control of the Terminal 3
Project in reliance on a contractual arrangement based on snippets of language is
misplaced. As admitted by Respondent itself and witness statements. Fraport never
exercised such control. Section 2-A of the ADL prohibits a foreigner to “intervene in the
management, operation, administration or control” of a public utility while it is not
prohibited to the foreigner to have some theoretical ability to intervene. Fraport never
intervened and Respondent has repeatedly admitted that Fraport was not in control of
PIATCO. Such control was exercised by the Chengs, not by Fraport,*” as confirmed by

one of Respondent’s witnesses, Mr. Losch.*%

. There could not have been any control by Fraport during the operations of the NAIA

Terminal 3 since due to Respondent’s actions PLATCO was not allowed to operate the
Terminal.’ There could be no malicious intent and no “planning” of a violation of the

law when the person is soliciting and following advice provided by counsel.*”°

Fraport’s role as Finance Arranger was within the permissible scope of Philippine law
since it was to assist PIATCO in dealing with potential lenders and had nothing to do with
the management, operation, administration or control of a corporation. Truly, Fraport
provided substantial funds to the Terminal 3 Project but it did not exclusively bankroll the
Project, the BOT law stating “the project proponents may obtain financing from foreign

sources.”“”! Messrs. Vogel and Struck acting as co-signatory to PIATCO bank accounts

jointly with the Chengs is not a management of bank accounts and is permitted by

Philippine law.*”

. Contrary to what asserted by Respondent, the interest free loan did not provide Claimant

with the right to vote the mortgaged shares.‘7? Fraport’s exclusive authority under the First
Addendum was clarified in the Special Shareholders’ Resolution of June 15, 2011,
determining that Fraport’s role consisted only in “making recommendation with respect to

the financing of the Project.” Any possible violation was therefore cured.*4

Also the role of Fraport’s employees and representatives to PLACO’s Board was consistent
with Philippine law and common practice. By definition the position of all directors is
non-executive and non-managerial. The position of Director of Finance in PIATCO is not
equivalent to the Chief Financial Officer.*”° No foreigners were appointed for the years
1999-2003 as corporate officers of PIATCO and if done it was done under the PEZA

law.*76

. Respondent’s assertion that under the PTI Shareholders Agreement Fraport planned and

got the ability to control PTI as Terminal operator, thereby violating the ADL, is untenable
since the contract with PIATCO (the Operations & Maintenance Agreement, i.e., “O&M

Agreement”*”

) never entered into force and the Terminal never experienced an in-service
date. PTI should not be subject to nationality requirements before it assumed the status of

facility operator.*78

Fraport’s representation on the PIATCO’s Board has always been in proportion to its

shareholding, as confirmed by the Joint Legal Opinion of Justices Melo, Tuquero and Dean

shareholding in PTI do not count since the control test applies.*”

. The ADL violation is alleged only in this arbitration and is not supported by the facts and
the Philippine jurisprudence. It is an invention for purpose of this dispute, as confirmed by
the fact that both the Philippine Supreme Court’s nullification of the Concession
Agreement and the taking over of Terminal 3 had nothing to do with the alleged ADL

we 480
violation.

. The theory on which the alleged violations are based, i.e. intervention under Section 2-A of
the ADL, has never been pursued domestically. The reason that is given is that the DOJ
prosecutors never had access to the same documents that Fraport was forced to produce in
this arbitration. This is not true since the two agreements on which the ICSID | Tribunal
and the ICC Tribunal respectively dismissed Fraport’s and PIATCO’s claims have been

known to Respondent for years and the annulled award has been published.**!

Claimant further notes that the ADL is a law of 1936, implemented in connection with
Article XII of the Constitution. It has been interpreted often inconsistently by numerous
SEC and DOJ Opinions predating the BOT law and the 1991 Foreign Investment Act that

govern foreign participation to the Philippine economy. **?

2.3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

As already mentioned, ***

at the jurisdictional level the Tribunal’s analysis shall be limited
to examine whether there was a violation of the ADL at the time of Fraport’s Initial

Investment. As it has emerged from the review of the Parties’ position, there are multiple

independent grounds relied upon by Respondent to establish ADL violations and a number

of different defenses put forward by Claimant to deny that any such violations occurred.

389. In essence, the analysis shall have to examine whether Section 2-A of the ADL***

(i) applied to PIATCO or PTI, as applicable prior to Terminal 3 becoming
operational;

(ii) applies to shareholder conduct;

(iii) prohibits planning of a prohibited act;

(iv) requires knowledge of the violation;

(v) allows for the curing of any violation;

(vi) provides for a “good faith” defense regarding any violation.

Each of the above questions shall be examined in turn, based on the provisions of

Philippine law that are relevant for the determination of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in light

of Objection 1.‘

484 The text of Section 2-A reads, in relevant part, as follows:

The relevant provisions of Philippine law have been referred to in the Introduction to Anti-Dummy Law.
supra, paras. 339-340.

The examination of the above questions shall be mostly conducted on the basis of the

legal opinions filed by each Party in support of the respective position. It bears noting that the first of such
opinions was filed by Claimant with the Memorial in reply to the parts of the annulled Award dealing with the

ADL violations.

This has brought about an inversion in the sequence of legal opinions, those on behalf of

Respondent replying to those filed by Claimant, not vice-versa as the burden of proof lying upon Respondent

121

a) Interpretation of the ADL

(i) | Whether the ADL Applied Prior to the Operation of Terminal 3

390. According to Claimant, the ADL is not applicable to the Terminal 3 Project because the
“construction and operation of a public utility are two distinct concepts that are subject to

different rule.” “*°

Only the operation of a public utility is subject to constitutional
nationality restrictions “because what constitutes a public utility activity is their use to
serve the public.”“*” Section 2-A only prohibits the intervention of a non-qualified third
party “in the management operation, administration or control of a nationalized activity
when the relevant right, franchise, privilege, property or business is actually enjoyed or
exercised as the word “enjoyment” in Section 2-A does not contemplate mere possession

but requires actual use of the restricted right, franchise, property or business. ***

39 489

. According to Claimant, under a BOT scheme” the mere act of building an infrastructure

does not convert the project into a public utility so that the private contractor does not need
a public utility franchise for that purpose. A franchise would be necessary only for the

operation of the facilities “because what constitutes a public utility activity is their use to

+» 490

serve the public. Only the operation of the facilities “would bring the private

contractor within the ambit of the constitutional nationality restrictions.”"”!

Still according to Claimant, PLATCO never engaged in the business of operating a public

utility. It was only engaged in the construction of Terminal 3, which “is not an

change in the rules governing burden of proof, as indicated in the text (supra, para. 299).

undertaking that subjects the corporation to the Anti-Dummy Law.”"? Although PIATCO
had the right to engage in the business of operating Terminal 3, a public utility, “it did not
use its right, franchise, privilege, property or right to actually engage in the business for

lack of operations.”*°°

. Respondent’s assertion that under the Shareholders Agreement of July 9, 1999, Fraport

“planned and obtained the ability to control PTI as terminal operator, and thereby violated
the Anti-Dummy Law" is in Claimant’s view untenable under Philippine law. PTI’s
role of facility operator under the BOT law was based on the O&M Agreement with
PIATCO that never entered into force, so that PTI never became terminal operator, the in-

service date for the Terminal having intervened after it was expropriated by Respondent.*”°

Respondent relies on the opinions of its legal experts, the former Chief Justice of the
Philippine Supreme Court, Reynato Puno, and Dean Danilo Concepcion, who both confirm
that “Fraport intervened in the management, operation, administration or control of

PIATCO and PTI, public utility enterprises under Philippine law.”

. This conclusion is based on the Pooling Agreement under which the Philippine

shareholders of PIATCO agreed to be bound by Fraport’s “recommendations” regarding
the implementation of the O&M Agreement, the operation, maintenance and management
of the Terminal complex, and the conduct of commercial operations within the Terminal

complex in the ordinary course of business.*°”

This conclusion equally applies to PTI, in view of the veto power and other forms of

negative control obtained by Fraport over PTI’s major corporate decisions.“

. According to Respondent’s legal expert Dean Concepcion, a potential operator of a public

utility is required to comply with nationality restrictions and the ADL at the moment it
applies for the right to operate, as held by a case cited in the Joint Legal Opinion of
Justices Melo, Tuquero and Dean Pangalangan, People v. Quasha, where the Supreme
Court declared that “the moment for determining whether a corporation is entitled to
operate as a public utility is when it applies for a franchise, certificate or any other form of
authorization for that purpose [...] and at that moment, the corporation must show that it
has complied not only with the requirement of the Constitution as to the nationality of its
capital [7

PTI was subject to the ADL from the time it applied with the DOTC as early as June 18,
1999 seeking approval of its designation as facility operator of the new Terminal 3. The
application was accepted on a non-objection basis by the DOTC on July 6, 1999,
“provided that it complies with pertinent Philippine laws and the bidding guidelines for the
NAIA IPT3 project.”> Thus, according to Respondent’s legal expert, “PTI was already
subject to nationality restrictions and the Anti-Dummy Law prior to Fraport’s acts of

: we 99501
intervention into PTI.

Even assuming that Terminal 3 would not be considered a public utility, and thus subject
to constitutional nationality restrictions, Section 2-A of the ADL also applies to rights,
franchises, privileges, property, and or businesses which are subject to statutory nationality

restrictions. As Justice Puno points out, Section 2(b) of the BOT law establishes

nationality requirements for project proponents, such as PIATCO. 5 PIATCO. was
accordingly subject to nationality restrictions beginning no later than the time it was
awarded the concession. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that PIATCO held, at the time
of Claimant’s Initial Investment, “a right [...] [or] privilege, [...] the exercise or enjoyment
of which is expressly reserved by [...] the laws to citizens of the Philippines [...]” and was

> In the

thus subject to the ADL’s prohibition on intervention by foreign citizens. 50:
Tribunal’s view, the fact that Section 2(a) of the BOT law expressly authorizes the use of
foreign financing and a foreign contractor in the construction phase of a BOT project
confirms that statutory nationality restrictions are otherwise applicable during the
construction phase, not simply that the law distinguishes between the construction and

operations phases of a BOT project.

It follows from this conclusion that PLATCO was, in implementing the Terminal 3 BOT
Project, actually enjoying and exercising its rights as a project proponent under the BOT
law. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that intervention in the management, control, or
administration of PIATCO by an unqualified person or entity would be prohibited by

Section 2-A of the ADL, even under Claimant’s view of the term “enjoyment.”

(ii) Shareholder Conduct under the ADL

. It is one of Claimant’s defenses under Section 2-A that in order to find a violation of the

ADL the type of act that a Philippine national intentionally must permit is the intervention
by a non-qualifying national as an employee, officer or laborer in the “management,
operation, administration or control of PIATCO.” Without such intervention, “there

cannot be a violation of the law.”°*

*” Puno (ICSID 2), paras. 41-44. Section 2(b) reads, in relevant part: “[IJn case of an infrastructure or

development facility whose operation requires a public utility franchise, the

roponent must be Filipino or, if a

 

corporation, must be duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and owned up to at least sixty
percent (60%) by Filipinos.”

503

In light of the Tribunal’s decision below not to address Respondent’s allegations vis-a-vis PTI, it is
unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider whether the ADL applied to PTI before its appointment as Terminal
operator became effective.

. Claimant relies on its legal experts’ opinion according to which Section 2-A does not
extend to shareholder’s conduct since only three categories of persons are identified in said
Section by referring to intervention by an “officer, employee or laborer,” while “[t]he term

‘shareholder’ is nowhere mentioned in Section 2-A.”>”

a

. Still according to Claimant, there is no reason for the ADL to apply to foreign shareholders
since by virtue of their minority status “they are already prevented from intervening in the
management, operation, administration or control of the public utility, unless they are

shown to be officers, employees and laborers.”°°°

404. In Claimant’s view, the scope of a statute may not be enlarged by interpreting it to apply to
situations or persons not provided by the text, this being especially true with penal laws
which are to be strictly construed.°"” Dean Concepcion relies on the Luzon decision for the
proposition that the judiciary may go beyond the words to give effect to the policy or
purpose of the statute. This is not tenable since that decision does not address
shareholders’ conduct as such and has been superseded by the 1973 Constitution and the

1975 amendment of the ADL.*°*

405. Thus, based on the principle of restrictive interpretation of penal laws, contrary to Dean
Concepcion’s contention the ADL cannot apply to Fraport since “[s]hareholder conduct is
not within the prohibition of intervention or participation in the management, operation,

administration or control, provided in the Anti-Dummy Law.”°?

Respondent relies on the expert opinions of Dean Concepcion and Justice Puno to refute
Claimant’s contention that the ADL does not apply to shareholder conduct. The ADL is

designed to prevent evasion of nationality restrictions by a foreign minority shareholder

through means by which it may intervene in the management, operation, administration or
control over a Philippine public utility. These means include the employment of aliens in
various positions to dominate the operations through management, technical and other
operating assistance and the provision of substantial amount of funding, as addressed by

DOJ Opinions.*!°

Respondent notes that the legislative purpose behind Section 2-A was to close all
loopholes permitting evasion of the Constitutional nationality restrictions and the
diminishment of effective Philippine control over national public utilities. Since this may
happen also as a result of a minority shareholder conduct, the argument that there is no
reason to apply Section 2-A to foreign minority shareholders is inconsistent with the

language, purpose and interpretation of the ADL.*!!

. According to Respondent’s expert, the argument as set forth in the Joint Legal Opinion of
Justices Melo, Tuquero and Dean Pangalangan that the power of the board of directors to
control a corporation prevents a minority shareholder from intervening in the management,
administration, operation or control of the corporation fails to consider that shareholders
may make binding agreements addressing the manner by which they exercise their voting

rights through directors appointed by them.>!?

As contended by Respondent’s expert, some of the agreements in this case expressly
provided that their provisions prevailed over the Articles of Incorporation and the By-laws
of the Company while permitting Fraport to nominate more than its proportionate share of
directors of PIATCO. Accordingly, the assertion that an agreement among shareholders

cf > p : 3
can never affect a board’s control of a company is wrong.”!

It is not necessary for the Tribunal to decide whether it is necessary to utilize a “restrictive

interpretation” or whether it is proper or permitted under Philippine and international law

to interpret the ADL in light of its purported purpose “to plug any loophole or close any
avenue that an unscrupulous alien may resort to flout the law or defeat its purpose.” This
is because the Tribunal considers that the language of the ADL is unambiguous on its face
that it applies to intervention by “any person.” The inclusion of the clause, “whether as an
officer, employee, or laborer,” appears to be an illustrative list of the diverse persons to
whom this prohibition applies (that is, in this instance “whether” is used to mean “for

example” or “‘including”).

. The Tribunal’s reading is consistent with the Supreme Court’s recognition in Luzon

Stevedoring v. Anti-Dummy Board that the ADL can be violated by minority shareholders.
While the Tribunal recognizes that the Philippines appears to have liberalized its policy
towards foreign investors subsequent to the 1972 Luzon decision, the Tribunal has been
provided with only one other Philippine legal authority that addresses this issue, a 1984
DOJ Opinion*"* which also advised that intervention by a minority shareholder would

violate the ADL.

For these reasons, the Tribunal considers that the ADL applies to intervention by “all”
unqualified persons, including minority shareholders, and that the reference to “officers,
employees and laborers” is non-exhaustive list of the categories of “persons” whose

conduct may be in violation of the ADL.

(iii) Whether the ADL Prohibits Planning a Prohibited Act without More

. According to Claimant’s experts, there would be no violation of the ADL “in case of an

attempted or frustrated violation thereof.”>!° Philippine law does not impose liability “on
the basis of intentions,” as they may be reflected by shareholder agreements granting rights
to minority shareholders to give them a broad protection. However, “whether these rights

are exercised is a separate issue.”°!°

actually committed, as asserted in Dean Concepcion and Justice Puno’s opinions, does not

S17

constitute per se such violation. Placing itself in a position to intervene in the

management, operation, administration or control of an entity subject to nationality
restrictions when none of the prohibited acts are executed does not violate the ADL.*'8

Mere planning is not a punishable offense, assuming arguendo that the Pooling Agreement

amounted to a “planning,” the contrary view expressed by Dean Concepcion being

contrary to the liberal construction of criminal statutes in favor of accused.>””

Always according to Claimant’s experts, even assuming that mere planning constitute an

ADL violation, there is no evidence that Fraport “knowingly,” “consciously, intelligently,

willfully or intentionally” engaged in such violation since it relied on the legal advice of its
Philippine counsel when it concluded arrangements concerning Terminal 3° The plain
reading of Section 2-A shows that there is a violation only when the prohibited acts “are

7 52!

consummate All acts prohibited by Section 2-A, as enumerated therein, are

“consummated acts.”°”

Accepting Dean Concepcion’s opinion would lead to an absurd situation whereby one who
“plans” to commit the offense is punished by the same penalty as the one who actually
committed the offense while the ADL provides only a single penalty. Assuming arguendo
that Fraport violated the ADL by merely planning or entering into the Pooling Agreement,
Claimant’s experts assert that any supposed violation was cured when the Pooling

Agreement was amended in 2001.93

417. On the opposite side, both Dean Concepcion and Justice Puno, Respondent’s legal experts,
express the view that Section 2-A of the ADL “prohibits even the planning of a violation
of the law,” pointing to the language of this provision when providing punishment for
“Tajny person who knowingly aids, assists or abets in the planning, consummation or

perpetration of any of the acts hereinabove enumerated.”°"4

418. In the present case, according to Dean Concepcion, Fraport not only planned to violate the
ADL, it negotiated and executed agreements that enabled it to unlawfully intervene in

Opinion, a minority foreign shareholder could violate the ADL by “placing itself in a

PIATCO and PTI, as known to its highest corporate levels.

position to intervene in the management, operation, administration or control of an entity

subject to nationality restrictions.”°”°

419. Dean Concepcion adds that so long as Fraport intended to execute shareholder agreements
with full knowledge of their terms, it is irrelevant whether it believed it was in fact
violating the ADL, such violations being illegal even in the absence of a malicious intent

when offenses are penalized by special laws, such as the ADL.”

420. The Tribunal believes it sufficient to refer to the plain wording of Section 2-A to consider
that “planning” may constitute per se a violation of the ADL. The relevant passage of the

law is as follows:

[A]ny person who knowingly aids, assists, or abets in the planning,
consummation or perpetration of any of the acts herein above enumerated
shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than five nor more than fifteen
years and by a fine [...] (emphasis added).

42

. The structure of this provision clearly contemplates liability for aiding, assisting, or

abetting in each of three separate types of activities: planning, consummation and

*4 Concepcion II (ICSID 2), para. 9 (emphasis in the text). Likewise, Puno asserts that “[iJt is worthy to note that

perpetration. In the Tribunal’s view, nothing in the wording of the statute, or in prior
judicial interpretations, indicates that liability for involvement in “planning” to allow a
prohibited act of intervention is dependent on the “consummation” or “perpetration” of the
object of such planning. The interpretation adopted by the Tribunal, contrary to
Claimant’s arguments, would not create criminal liability for “attempted dummyship,” but
simply gives effect to the statutory language prohibiting completed acts of aiding,

assisting, and abetting in the planning of prohibited conduct.

528

As shown by the analysis of Fraport’s contractual arrangements, planning” was

achieved by Fraport:

- in the case of PIATCO, by executing with the Philippine shareholders the
Pooling Agreement of July 6, 1999 granting Fraport the power to intervene
in the management, administration, operation and control of the Terminal,
and

- in the case of PTI, by the PTI Shareholders Agreement of even date
ensuring Fraport a power of control regarding PTI’s future role as
contractor-operator of the Terminal.

administration or control of PIATCO and PTI is a violation of the ADL from the time of
the planning.” The relevant time was the date of execution of the Pooling Agreement and
the PTI Shareholders Agreement, therefore contemporaneous with the making of Fraport’s

Initial Investment.

(iv) Whether a Violation Requires “Knowledge”

Claimant argues that it could not have violated the ADL because it sought the advice of
local counsel in drafting the Pooling Agreement.>*” In particular, Claimant argues that

such efforts to comply with the ADL mean that it could not have “knowingly” violated the

ADL.*?! However, as explained below, the Tribunal finds that the requirement under
Section 2-A of the ADL to have “knowingly” engaged in a prohibited act does not mean
that a person must know that an act is prohibited to commit a violation—that is, it does not

require intent to violate the law.

As explained in Dean Concepcion’s opinion, Philippine criminal law contains a class of
criminal prohibitions, known as special laws, which have been enacted outside of the
Revised Penal Code to serve public policy or regulatory purposes. The violation of special
laws does not require malicious intent, or mens rea. Rather, in the words of a leading
treatise, “it is sufficient that the offender has the intent to perpetrate the act prohibited by
the special law. Intent to commit the crime and intent to perpetrate the act must be
distinguished. A person may not have consciously intended to commit a crime; but he did
intend to commit an act, and that act is, by the very nature of things, the crime itself.”>>*
Such “intent to perpetrate the act” means only that that act was done freely and

consciously.>*

Claimant’s legal experts argue that special laws do not necessarily eliminate the
requirement of mens rea, but that the intent required for a violation is a question of

statutory construction.*

As neither Party points to a decision of a Philippine court on the issue, the Tribunal must
construe the language of Section 2-A of the ADL itself, which prohibits “knowingly
aid[ing], assist[ing], or abet[ting] in the planning, consummation or perpetration” of certain
specified acts. The Tribunal considers this language to require that a person freely and
consciously engages in an act which aids, assists, or abets in the planning or carrying out
any of the specified acts, not that the person must have knowledge that what is being

planned or carried out is prohibited by the ADL. Accordingly, it would be sufficient in

order to establish liability that a person freely and consciously engaged in an act which
constituted aiding, assisting or abetting the planning or carrying out of a prohibited act. As
made manifest by the Tribunal’s analysis also of the other ADL violations, including
“planning,” it may be concluded that Claimant freely and consciously engaged in such an

act.

(v) Whether a Violation Can Be Cured

The Tribunal recalls Claimant’s position that even assuming arguendo that the Pooling
Agreement violated the ADL, this agreement was amended in 2001 to eliminate Fraport’s
right of recommendation, thereby curing any violation that had existed. Because the issue
before the Tribunal is the legality of Fraport’s investment at the time it was made, the
Tribunal considers that the 2001 amendment to the Pooling Agreement would be relevant
as a defense to Respondent’s jurisdictional objection only if, under Philippine law, such an

amendment would retroactively eliminate any illegality that had existed.

Whether a violation of host State law at the time an investment is made can be cured after
the fact—thus avoiding the consequences under the BIT—should be determined by
reference to the law of the host State. If the law of the host State allows an investor to take
subsequent action to cure the violation and thereby avoid liability, a tribunal must also take
this fact into account when assessing compliance with the law. However, in this instance,
the Tribunal does not consider that, under Philippine law, a violation of the ADL may be

cured.

Claimant’s argument that Philippine law allows it to cure an ADL violation prior to any
enforcement proceedings relies on the explanation of the Supreme Court in Gamboa that
“public utilities that fail to comply with the nationality requirement under Section 11,
Article XII [of the Constitution] and the [Foreign Investment Act] can cure their
deficiencies prior to the start of the administrative case or investigation.”**> However, as
Dean Concepcion points out, Gamboa involved a regulatory enforcement regime whereby

the opportunity to cure was provided for in the underlying statute, which is not the case

Rep., para. 160 (quoting Gamboa et al. v. Teves et al., G.R. No. 176579, p. 47 (CE-178)).

133

43

with the ADL.**° Nor are Gamboa or the cases cited therein inconsistent with Supreme
Court’s earlier holding in Avengoza that cessation of an ADL violation does not preclude
criminal liability for the prior illegality.°*” As Claimant has not offered another basis in
Philippine law for its asserted right to cure an ADL violation, the Tribunal finds that
Claimant would not have been allowed under Philippine law to cure an ADL violation by

amending the offending agreement.

(vi) Good Faith as a Defense

. Prior to making the Initial Investment Fraport had been advised by its Philippine Counsel,

QT, regarding limitations imposed by the Philippine Constitution and the ADL to a foreign
investor in the exercise of management or financial control over a public utility such as
Terminal 3. Already in a Preliminary Due Diligence Report transmitted on January 11,
1999, QT had called Fraport’s attention to such limitations by summarizing the relevant

legal provisions as follows:

The operation and ownership of a public utility is reserved by the Philippine
Constitution to Filipino citizen or to domestic corporations owned at least
60% by Filipinos. This means that foreign nationals can only own a
maximum of 40% of the capital of a public utility. The operations of the
Company generally fall within the term “public utility’. Thus, the direct
equity investment of FAG together with the equity in the Company presently
held by foreign nationals cannot exceed 40% of the outstanding capital stock
of the Company. At present, the Company is owned 75% by Philippine
nationals and 25% by foreign nationals.

The Anti-Dummy Law prohibits foreign nationals from, among others,
intervening in the management, operation, administration or control of a
company engaged in a partially nationalized activity (e.g. a public utility)
except as technical personnel with specific authority from the Secretary of the
Department of Justice. Further the Philippine Constitution provides that all
executive and management positions in a public utility must be occupied by
Filipino citizens. However, foreign nationals are entitled to such number of
directors in the board of a public utility in proportion to their actual and
allowable equity in the Company. In view of the Anti-Dummy Law and the

°36 Concepcion II (ICSID 2), paras. 31-34.
37 Thid., paras. 24-25, 35-38.

134

provision of the Philippine Constitution, arrangements other than mere equity

investments between FAG and the Company, must be considered carefully.”

432. One month after QT had delivered its Report, Fraport received from PIATCO a Master

43,

4B

o

-

Concession Concept Brief contemplating the relinquishment by PIATCO to Fraport of full
executive and management control over the Terminal 3 Project and indicating how this

would have been achieved:

A shareholders agreement will have to secure the actual control by FAG as
may be allowed by Philippine laws. Actual control refers to full executive and
management control by FAG.”

The reference made by PIATCO to actual control being ceded to FAG “as may be allowed
by Philippine laws” was a reminder of the restrictions imposed by Philippine nationality
laws. The reference to what “may be allowed by Philippine laws” was totally inconsistent

with the ADL prohibiting a foreign investor to intervene in the management, operation,

administration or control of a public utility.

. Despite QT’s warning, Fraport proceeded to implement the shareholding structure

contemplated by the Master Concession Concept Brief, as reflected by the Final Report
submitted on February 26, 1999 to its Supervisory Board.’ The Final Report confirmed
that Fraport would obtain and exercise management and control over the Terminal 3

Project, seeking the Board’s approval to invest in PIATCO.

It is worth reproducing the key passage of the Report since what stated therein reflects the
manner by which Fraport’s Initial Investment was to be structured so as to secure

management and control over the Project.

Under Philippine law, the share of non-Philippine capital in PLATCO may not
exceed 40% [....] Within PIATCO, all shareholders will enter into a

Shareholder Agreement that will also define the management appointments,
voting rights and provisions for the acquisition and sale of shares. Another
Shareholder Agreement between FAG, PAGS, Paircargo and PTI makes sure
that the above-mentioned parties will hold a majority of 51% in PIATCO. It
also establishes that FAG will be consulted in matters that represent its core
competencies (retailing, terminal operation). PAGS and Paircargo are willing
to accept the professional advice of FAG in abovementioned decisions as
binding, which, however, cannot be enforced legally because of local laws. In
order to reinforce this declaration of intent, the idea is for GlobeGround and
FAG to conclude an additional agreement under German law making the
provisions of the Shareholder Agreement binding on the mandate holders.
After the afore-mentioned transactions, PLATCO will have only a passive role,
while the main activities will be controlled by PTI as concessionaire for
operations and center management.

Two aspects of the above quoted part of the Final Report are worth noting. First, reference
to the acceptance by PIATCO’s Philippine Shareholders of FAG’s “professional advice” as
“binding” in matters of its competence is consistent with what was subsequently provided
by the Pooling Agreement regarding the acceptance of Fraport’s recommendations by the
other shareholders.” Second, recognition that the transfer to FAG of management and
control of the Terminal operations “cannot be enforced legally because of local laws,”
coupled with the plan to “reinforce this declaration of intent” by concluding an additional
agreement governed by German law to guarantee the binding nature of the provisions of
the Shareholder Agreement,™? clearly evidences the full awareness of all parties, including
Fraport and its Supervisory Board, of the illegality under Philippine law of the proposed
transfer of control over the Project to Fraport, with PIATCO retaining only a “passive

role.”

The condition under Section 2-A whereby the intervention in the management, operation,
administration or control of a public utility is made “knowingly” by the foreign investor

was satisfied beyond any possible doubt.

This additional agreement “does not exist” according to one of Claimant's witnesses, Mrs. Déerte Ochs (Ochs

(ICSID 2), para. 15). Obviously, what matters is that it was contemplated for the stated purpose.

7. The illegality of Fraport’s Initial Investment for violation of the ADL is clearly established
based on the unequivocal evidence provided by Respondent. It remains to be examined
whether Fraport may invoke as a defense, as it has claimed, the extensive communications
with its local counsel. According to Claimant, this would show the efforts it made to
understand and comply with ADL, a law as to which inconsistent and contradictory
opinions had been issued by the Philippine enforcement agencies.“ Fraport adds that in
particular the Pooling Agreement was drafted in consultation with the Philippine counsel
QT, so that there could be no planning of a violation of the ADL’s prohibition to intervene

in the management, operation, administration or control of a public utility.

~

There is no clear evidence that the Pooling Agreement, in the text finally adopted, was
drafted in consultation with QT. By letter of June 14, 1999, to PAGS, copied to
Mr. Archer and Mrs. Ochs of Fraport, referring to Article 2.02(2)(a) of FAG-
PAIRCARGO-PAGS-PTI Shareholders Agreement, the Pooling Agreement, QT suggested
to amend it by adding at the beginning the words “Jn view of FAG’s unparalleled and
proven expertise in international airport terminal operations, which the Shareholders
expressly acknowledge” and at the end the words “The Shareholders shall act upon the
recommendations of FAG.” “6 QT’s advice regarding this provision is confirmed by

Mrs. Ochs’ written statement of August 9, 2012, enclosed with Claimant’s Memorial.

©

In a letter of four days later, June 18, 1999, however, QT advised FAG, in the person of the
same Mrs. Ochs, that they “are still of the opinion that a voting agreement which gives
FAG control of the vote of a total of 51% of the outstanding capital stock of PIATCO

would be violative of the Anti-Dummy Law,

Strange enough, Mrs. Ochs, although the destinee of QT’s letter of June 18, 1999, does not
refer to it in her Witness Statement. In the presence of two conflicting legal opinions,
signed by the same lawyers on behalf of QT the Tribunal shall assume that the later in time
replaced the previous one so that Fraport should have relied on the June 18, 1999 advice,
the latter having been delivered sufficiently in advance of the date on which the Pooling

Agreement was executed to be implemented.

The Tribunal does not need to examine Respondent’s reply that the ADL is a special law,
violations of which are “mala prohibita,” are unlawful from the moment of commission
and do not require proof of malicious intent.’ The evidence in the file, particularly the
Final Report submitted to Fraport’s Supervisory Board, clearly shows that Fraport was
fully aware at the time of its Initial Investment of the illegality under the ADL of any
contractual arrangements permitting it to intervene in the management, operation,

administration or control of a public utility such as Terminal 3.550

. There is therefore no room for “good faith,” “absence of intent” or a similar defense by

Fraport. Fraport’s interest in entering into the Project was so great that the decision was
made to approve the proposed transaction despite the risk resulting from the failure to
comply with the Philippine Constitution and the ADL. A risk that had been well-
understood since March 1999 by a member of Fraport’s Supervisory Board, Mr. Werner
Schmidt, who had warned the Board that “the summary of the agreements contains the
statement that a decisive voting right of FAG would violate the anti-dummy law of the
Philippines. Consequently, FAG cannot legally enforce its intended leadership in this

consortium. This, however, is the most important prerequisite for the entire transaction.”*!

b) Assessment of Fraport’s Alleged ADL Violation
Having determined that the ADL was applicable to PIATCO prior to Terminal 3 becoming
operational; that shareholder conduct may violate the ADL; that involvement in the
planning of an act prohibited by the ADL, without more, is sufficient to give rise to
criminal liability; that liability does not require knowledge that an action violated the ADL;
and that a violation cannot be cured by cessation of the offending act, the Tribunal now
turns to the specific violations alleged by Respondent. To recall, to establish the type of
violation of Section 2-A of the ADL alleged by Respondent, the following elements must

be shown:

(i) A person or entity possess a right to engage in an activity subject to
nationality restrictions;

(ii) Such person or entity permit—or engage in planning to permit—an
unqualified person to intervene in the management, operation,
administration, or control of that nationalized activity; and

(iii) A person aids, assists, or abets in the planning or carrying out of such an
intervention.

. In this case, the Tribunal has already found that PIATCO possessed a right to engage in an

activity subject to nationality restrictions—namely, function as a project proponent for a
public utility under the BOT law. Because it is argued that Fraport (or its officials) were
both the person(s) who were unlawfully permitted (or planned to be permitted) to intervene
and the person(s) who aided, assisted, or abetted in planning or carrying out such
intervention, the decisive issue for both the second and third elements is whether a

prohibited intervention was planned or carried out.

Having carefully reviewed the Parties’ position as summarized above*™ and as shall be
further detailed, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that by executing a series of
agreements with PIATCO’s Philippine shareholders concurrently with its Initial
Investment, Fraport ensured itself a power of intervention in the management, operation,

administration and control of PIATCO and PTI in violation of the ADL. The analysis shall

be based essentially on the Pooling Agreement regarding PIATCO and PTI and on the PTI
Shareholders Agreement regarding PTI.

. The Pooling Agreement? is the most important of the series of agreements entered into by

Fraport with the Philippine shareholders of PLATCO at the time of its Initial Investment.
As recorded by the Fourth Whereas Clause, the parties to the Pooling Agreement (therein
referred to as “the Shareholders”) at the time owned an aggregate of fifty-one percent
(51%) of the capital stock of PIATCO, Fraport (at the time called “FAG”) owning 25% of
that capital. The most significant provisions of the Pooling Agreement for the present

analysis are Articles 1.05, 2.01, 2.02 and 2.06.

Article 1.05 provides that throughout the life of the Pooling Agreement “the Shareholders
shall maintain their respective percentages of ownership of capital stock” and “shall not
sell any of their shares of stock, or permit the dilution of their percentage of ownership

[...] without the prior written consent of all the Shareholders.”

They key provisions at issue are contained in Articles 2.01 and 2.02. Article 2.01 commits
the Shareholders and their nominees to PLATCO’s Board of Directors to vote as a single

block, as follows:

2.01 Without prejudice to Article 2.05,°°4 the Shareholders, through their
representatives at any stockholders’ meeting of the Corporation and through
their nominee directors at any meeting of the Corporation’s board of directors,
shall, at all times, vote as a block and have a common vote on every matter for
which their vote is required or permitted to be taken by law or by the Articles
of Incorporation or By-laws of the Corporation.

448. Article 2.02 sets out the process for determining the Shareholders’ joint position,

beginning with by meeting in advance of any votes with the objective of achieving

unanimity. If the Shareholders cannot reach agreement, Article 2.02(2) provides that:

58 CBII-80/RE-34, FAG-PAICARGO-PAGS-PTI Shareholders’ Agreement, July 6, 1999.

°4 Under Article 2.05 the Shareholders confirm that “where the operations and maintenance of the Terminal
Complex, in general, are involved [...] Article 2.02 shall apply.”

140

449. The Pooling Agreement thus provides for two approaches to disagreements among the

Within a reasonable time prior to the date set for a stockholders’ or board

all the possible consequences of an affirmative and of a negative vote, with a
view to arriving at a unanimous vote. The position of each Shareholder during
the preliminary meeting shall be given equal weight (i.e., FAG, PAIRCARGO,
PAGS and PTI shall have one vote each).

In case the Shareholders are unable to reach a common position,

The Shareholders shall consult FAG and FAG may make recommendations in
relation to any of the following matters (which matters fall within FAG’s area of
expertise and competence):

the implementation of the O&M Agreement, as executed;

the operation, maintenance and management of the Terminal Complex;

the conduct of commercial operations within the Terminal Complex in the
ordinary course of business.

The Shareholders shall thereafter act upon the recommendations of FAG.

unless the Shareholders thereafter agree to postpone any action on the matter, the
issue shall be submitted for resolution by three (3) arbitrators appointed under and
acting pursuant to the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of
Commerce. Arbitration shall be for the purpose of determining the course of action
most favorable to the interests of the Shareholders and most consistent with Article
1.

Shareholders: If the operations and management of the terminal complex is implicated,

Fraport is allowed to make “recommendations” and the other shareholders “shall thereafter

. Under Article 2.06 the shareholders took the further engagement to make sure that their
respective nominees in the board of directors and representatives in all stockholders
meeting be present at all respective meetings, be fully informed of the terms of the

Agreement and of the vote reached by the Shareholders’ vote strictly in accordance with

the Shareholders’ decisions and are immediately replaced should they not comply with the

Agreement.

. By the combination of the above provisions the parties to the Pooling Agreement

established a block voting arrangement for its entire duration, ensuring at the same time
that their respective nominees in the board of directors and representatives in the
shareholders’ meetings vote in conformity with the decisions previously reached by the
shareholders under sanction of being replaced in case of non-compliance. It is now to be
examined to what extent the described voting and other arrangements ensured Fraport’s
management, operation, administration and control over Terminal 3 operations in violation

of the ADL.

Articles 1.05, 2.01, 2.02(1) and 2.06 have raised no controversy between the Parties nor do
they raise questions from the Tribunal in view of their unequivocal language and purpose.
This is not the case of Article 2.02(2)(a) which, after providing that the Shareholders shall
consult FAG in case of inability to reach a common position in the preliminary meeting
held under Article 2.02(1), concludes by stating that “FAG may make recommendations”
in relation to certain enumerated matters and that “the Shareholders shall thereafter act

upon the recommendations of FAG.”

The Parties’ position regarding the interpretation of the last sentences of Article
20.02(2)(a) has been mentioned before 555 and shall not be repeated here. While
“recommendation” stands for “something that is recommended, such as a course of
action,”*°° having as such no binding force on the destinee, the expression “act upon”

means “to regulate one’s behavior in accordance’ so that the destinee of the

The matters covered by Fraport’s recommendations under Article 2.02(2)(a) of the Pooling

Agreement related to critical aspects of the Terminal 3 Project:

(i) The implementation of the O&M [i.
Agreement, as executed;

Operation and Maintenance]

 

(ii) The operation, maintenance and management of the Terminal Complex;
(iii) The conduct of commercial operations within the Terminal Complex in the

management, operation, administration or control” of a nationalized activity in violation of

Section 2-A of the ADL.

an

. That the above is the correct reading of the last sentence of Article 2.02(2)(a) is confirmed
by the evidence in the file showing clearly that the intent was to give Fraport actual control
over the Terminal 3 Project in view of PIATCO’s lack of experience in operating airport
terminals. The Master Concession Concept Brief of January 19, 1999, contemplated that
“[a] shareholders agreement will have to secure the actual control by FAG as may be
allowed by Philippine laws. Actual control refers to full executive management control by

°58 This was also the conclusion of the Tribunal in ICSID 1 Award (CBII-409), paras. 351, 398: “Even if the
shareholders do not agree, Fraport’s view is controlling with respect to the matters itemized in Article 2.02(2). In
short, for those items, Fraport secures managerial control in violation of the ADL [...] Fraport concluded that the
only plausible way for its equity investment to prove profitable was to arrange secretly for management and
control on the project in a way which the investor knew were not in accordance with the law of the Philippine.
This was accomplished by Article 2.02 of the FAG-Paircargo- PAGS-PTI Shareholders’ Agreement of July 6,
1999 which allowed Fraport (or FAG as it was then known) to have a casting and controlling vote over matters
which fell within its areas of expertise and competence.” Likewise, according to the ICC Tribunal in Philippine
International Air Terminals Co., Inc. v. The Government of the Republic of the Philippines (ICC Case No.
12610/TE/MW/AVH/JEM/MLK), Partial Award, July 22, 2010 (CBII-414), para. 538: “The words of the
concluding part of Article 2.02(2)(a) are perfectly clear. There is a requirement that ‘the shareholders shall
thereafter act upon the recommendations of FAG.’ It is, in the Tribunal’s opinion, undoubtedly the intention of
the parties as expressed in the Pooling Agreement that in relation to the three matters mentioned in Article
2.02(2)(a) the position of Fraport will prevail in the event the parties are not unanimous.”

FAG.” As previously noted, the inconsistency between this last statement and the
prudent reference to what “may be allowed by Philippine laws” is manifest, Philippine law

on the matter not allowing Fraport any measure of control.

45

an

Claimant refers to the different language of Article 2.05 providing that in case of lack of
unanimity regarding matters falling within PAGS’s or PAIRCARGO’s competence the
Shareholders undertake to vote strictly in accordance with the position taken respectively
by PAGS or PAIRCARGO to infer that there is no similar undertaking regarding Fraport’s
recommendations. The Tribunal notes that this provision confirms the binding nature of
Fraport’s recommendation right. In general, this provision unambiguously directs the
Shareholders to vote in accordance with the position of PAGS or PAIRCARGO,
respectively, when an issue directly affects the business operations of either at the terminal.
However, Article 2.05 is deemed not to apply when the operations and maintenance of the
terminal complex is at issue, in which case Article 2.02 applies. Yet, this exception would
be meaningless unless Fraport’s recommendation was binding, as there would be little
reason for Fraport to recommend how PAGS and PAIRCARGO vote when their own

business operations were implicated, unless they were bound by that recommendation.*”!

45

n

Evidence on the record suggesting that the Shareholders considered Fraport’s
recommendations to be binding confirms the Tribunal’s finding. For example, in a letter to
Cheng Yong dated July 6, 2001, Mr. Bernd Struck of Fraport referred to the proposed

revisions to the Pooling Agreement as “waiv[ing] the binding nature of its

recommendation rights.”>°

*6! The Tribunal does not find much probative value in the difference between the language used in Article
2.02(2)(a) and Article 2.05 to describe different parties’ rights to decide the common position of the Shareholders,
as it could just as likely indicate artful drafting as a substantive difference.

RE-1485, Letter from Bernd Struck to Cheng Yong, July 6, 2001. Other evidence on the record, despite pre-
dating the conclusion of the Pooling Agreement, suggests that Fraport’s recommendation right was intended to be

144

Fraport’s Supervisory Board was in agreement that control of the Project was required. A
resolution of March 1999 mentions Fraport’s opportunity to “assume the leadership in the
PIATCO’s consortium” by becoming “responsible for the planning, building and operation
of the new terminal.”* The Resolution followed a Final Holding Report that had been
submitted to the Supervisory Board which clearly shows that the highest level of Fraport’s
decision-making authority had been made aware that the control of a Philippine public
utility by a foreign minority shareholder was contrary to Philippine law™™ but that it had

accepted to run the related risk.

The foregoing analysis is sufficient to conclude for the ADL violation by Fraport at the
time of its Initial Investment. Other grounds of violation may be added. An additional one
is the role given to Fraport as Financial Arranger for the Terminal 3 Project. The First
Addendum to the PIATCO Shareholders Agreement dated July 6, 1999, in addition to
conferring to Fraport this role specifies that Fraport “shall have exclusive authority to
determine the financial arrangements for the project... including the nomination of the

Company’s financial advisers [...].” The role was therefore not just to act as a financial
advisor but to take decisions binding on the Company regarding all financial aspects of the
Project in lieu of PIATCO’s Board of Directors, thus adding another essential
“intervention in the management, operations, administrations or control” of PIATCO, in

violation of Section 2-A of the ADL.

No ADL violation is to be found regarding Fraport’s appointment of directors in
PIATCO’s Board of Directors in excess of its proportionate share participation, as alleged
by Respondent. At the time of its Initial Investment, in fact, no directors had been

appointed by Fraport in PIATCO’s Board.

in PIATCO and PTI. In a PIATCO’s Board meeting of July 8, 1999, Mr. Hans-Arthur
Vogel, a German national, was entrusted with financial matters as PLATCO’S and PTI’s
Director of Finance. The minutes of that Board meeting note that Fraport’s Stephan
Bauchspiess, also a German national, was appointed as PIATCO’s Director for Terminal
Operations, Building Managements & Personnel Affairs having authority, together with

Hans-Arthur Vogel, to sign banking documents on behalf of PIATCO.*®

These appointments were in contravention of the Philippine Constitution and the ADL.
The Constitution provides in Article XIII, para. 11, that “all the executive and managing
officers of a corporation or association must be citizens of the Philippines.” Section 2-A of
the ADL prohibits all interventions in the “management, operation, administration or
control” of a public utility, “except for technical personnel whose employment has been
authorized by the Secretary of Justice.’ DOJ Opinions confirm that this prohibition
applies to aliens in any position at a public utility. As stated by the Supreme Court, the
purpose of this prohibition is to prevent a minority shareholder’s exercise of control

through the employment of aliens.

. Fraport’s appointment of persons in various positions in PIATCO and PTI was neither

authorized by the Secretary of Justice nor fell under the PEZA law. The latter could not
derogate from the provision of the Constitution preventing foreign nationals from holding
executive and managing officers position in Philippine public utilities. 567 These
appointments placed even more Fraport in the position to intervene in the management,
operation, administration and control of PLATCO and PTI, in violation of Section 2-A of

the ADL.

A further violation of Section 2-A results from arrangements agreed under the PTI
Shareholders’ Agreement of July 6, 1999.°° Pursuant to this Agreement, Fraport and PTH
became shareholders of a newly formed company, PTI, created to enter into the O&M
Agreement with PIATCO for the operation and maintenance of the Terminal Complex and
to serve as contractor-operator under said agreement. 56° Under the PTI Shareholders
Agreement, Fraport was granted authority to designate PTI’s Chairman and the director in
charge of finance, administration and commercial operations, permitting Fraport-appointed

570

directors to sign checks on behalf of PTI.”’” More than that, the Agreement gave Fraport

ultimate decision-making power in relation to Terminal 3 operations, as stated by the last

Whereas Clause:

“WHEREAS, PTH Inc. acknowledges the unparalleled and proven expertise
of FAG international airport terminal operations and undertakes to respect
FAG’s decision or position in relation to the performance of the contractor-
operator’s obligations under the O&M Agreement.”

. It is to be recalled in this connection that the implementation of the O&M Agreement was

one of the three matters on which Fraport had ultimate control through binding

' Ultimate control over PTI’s role as

recommendations under the Pooling Agreement.”
contractor-operator of the Terminal 3 was accordingly granted to Fraport, PLATCO
relinquishing to the latter the control over the Terminal operations. This is a further
confirmation of Fraport’s “intervention in the management, operation, administration or

control” of a Philippine public utility, in contravention to Section 2-A of the ADL.

A Supervisory Board’s resolution dated March 12, 1999, approved the acquisition of a

arguments and the evidence on the record, the Tribunal finds that Fraport violated the ADL
when making its Initial Investment, the latter being consequently excluded as investment
protected by the BIT because of its illegality. The illegality of the investment at the time it
is made goes to the root of the host State’s offer of arbitration under the treaty. As it has
been held, “States cannot be deemed to offer access to the ICSID dispute settlement

mechanism to investments made in violation of their own law. ST

Lack of jurisdiction is
founded in this case on the absence of consent to arbitration by the State for failure to

satisfy an essential condition of its offer of this method of dispute settlement.

The Tribunal therefore considers that there is no legal dispute arising out of, or a
divergence concerning, an “investment” and, moreover, that Respondent has not consented
to the arbitration of Claimant’s claims with respect to its investment. Accordingly, the
Tribunal holds that it lacks jurisdiction over Claimant’s claims pursuant Article 25(1) of
the ICSID Convention and Article 9 of the BIT. It also follows that the Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction over Respondent’s counterclaims in view of their necessary connection with
the subject matter of the dispute pursuant to Article 46 of the ICSID Convention.*”* The
Tribunal notes that the request of an award of costs cannot properly be considered a
counterclaim. Therefore, the dismissal of the counterclaims does not affect the Tribunal’s

discretion to allocate costs.

3. Jurisdictional Objection 2: There is no Jurisdiction and all of Fraport’s

Claims are Inadmissible as a Result of Fraport’s Corruption and Fraud
Also in this case the analysis shall be limited to examine whether the facts on which
Jurisdictional Objection 2 is founded intervened at the time of Fraport’s Initial Investment.
Specifically, the Tribunal shall review Respondent’s submissions and underlying evidence
to determine whether, as alleged by Respondent, Fraport was aware of and actively

engaged in corruption and fraud when making its Initial Investment.

jurisdiction over these proceedings” (C-Mem., para. 1171).

470. The reading of Respondent’s submissions on the subject reveals that the alleged
“corruption and fraud” relate to a phase of the implementation of the NAIA Terminal

Project after the time of Fraport’s Initial Investment.

47

. According to Respondent’s first submission, Fraport and PIATCO engaged in a range of

illicit activities which included:

- Hiring a “consultant” to bribe officials to issue the Government approvals
that PIATCO needed in order to begin drawing down its long-term loans;

- Engaging in an elaborate kickback scheme of overbilling the Government,
which permitted PIATCO’s management and allies to profit from sub-
standard work; and

- Laundering funds allegedly paid as project expenses in order to conceal their
actual destinations and uses.°”*

472. The only part of this Chapter of the Counter-Memorial dealing with facts predating
Fraport’s Initial Investment is the alleged awareness by Fraport of a US $4 million
payment made by PIATCO to Datacenta to an offshore bank account in Hong-Kong*”®
pursuant to a consultancy Agreement signed by PIATCO sometime in 1997.57” The
allegation is that Fraport was aware of this payment which was included in PIATCO’s

2,578

project costs of February 7, 200: as to which however neither Fraport nor PLATCO

have produced evidence proving the propriety of the contract and related payment.°”

relating to the Terminal 3 Project. All such activities, assuming they had actually been put

in place, intervened after the time of Fraport’s Initial Investment.**!

#

A drastic change in Respondent’s contention regarding Fraport’s alleged engagement in
corruption and fraud is to be found in its Post-Hearing Submission in reply to Fraport’s
defense that “the allegations of corruption and wrongdoing almost exclusively involve
alleged events years after Fraport’s equity investment in July 1999 and do not relate to the
pre-investment stage.”** To reply to this somewhat new argument, Respondent asserts

583 ce:

that, contrary to the position in the arbitration case relied upon by Claimant, ‘in this

case, by contrast, the corruption and fraud directly relate to the making and implementation

of Claimant’s investments.”***

47

an

. By drawing a distinction between the “making” and the “implementation” by Fraport of its
investment, Respondent attempts to overcome the absence of proof, as alleged by
Claimant, regarding Fraport being engaged in corruption and fraud also at the time of its
Initial Investment. Respondent first contends that the prima facie evidence it has presented
in support of its allegation shifts the burden of proof onto the Claimant,** to then assert
that in case of payments to Government officials direct evidence is not required,
circumstantial evidence being sufficient, the latter consisting of “indicia” or “red flags” in

the case of corruption. °°

be August 22, 1997.°°” The assumptions made by Respondent in this regard may be

summarized as follows:

- The payments made to Datacenta, an entity without experience, were made
for unspecified services and were exorbitant, which is indicative of
corruption;***

- “The evidence thus reflects that the basis for awarding the concession was a
corrupt bait-and-switch involving Security Bank which was connected to
President Estrada and the Zamoras, and the PLIATCO made corrupt payments
to these officials through sham consulting payments to Datacenta among
other companies,” PLATCO’s Concession being “thus unlawful”;>*?

- Regardless of what Fraport knew of PIATCO’s corruption, its investment is
unlawful and not protected by the Bir.”

-  Fraport knew before it invested that PIATCO “was not transparent enough,”
KPMG Due Diligence Report dated January 20, 1999, having informed
Fraport of the payment of US $6.5 million to Datacenta and that
“PIATCO’s books and records contained some major accounts that need to
be adjusted to maintain consistency and propriety of financing statement
presentation.”**!

All other factual circumstances relied upon by Respondent relate to a period of time
subsequent to Fraport’s Initial Investment.

Claimant replies that despite all power and resources to investigate its allegations of
corruption, Respondent has been unable to proffer direct evidence of corruption. As held
by other investment treaty tribunals, evidence of corruption must be clear and

convincing.*”” In its view, it is unreasonable to contend that it is the allegedly corrupt

party that has to prove its innocence, having on its part amply met its burden of production
by filing 100.000 plus pages of documents, including documents seized by the German
prosecutor, in response to 21 requests granted by the Tribunal relating to corruption
allegations. Further, testimony was produced by it, confirming the contemporaneous
documentary evidence that Fraport understood that PIATCO, as customary in the industry,

was hiring a consultant.°>

. With specific reference to Respondent’s allegation that it invested in a corrupt enterprise,

Fraport notes how extraordinary is this statement, made in the absence of any evidence and
based on events pre-dating its investment. The 1997 Agreement between Datacenta and
PIATCO, relied upon by Respondent for its allegations of corruption, has nothing to do

with its investment, having been signed more than two years before.°™*

The Tribunal holds that considering the difficulty to prove corruption by direct evidence,
the same may be circumstantial. However, in view of the consequences of corruption on
the investor’s ability to claim the BIT protection, evidence must be clear and convincing so
as to reasonably make-believe that the facts, as alleged, have occurred. Having reviewed
the Parties’ positions and the available evidence related to the period prior to Fraport’s
Initial Investment, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that Respondent has failed to

provide clear and convincing evidence regarding corruption and fraud by Fraport.

The assumptions made regarding in particular the Datacenta Agreement 5° are not

supported by evidence. There is a leap in the logic in alleging Fraport’s corruption
regarding events having taken place much before the time it made the Initial Investment or
regarding payments to Datacenta made by PIATCO after the Concession had been

obtained and still ongoing in March-June 1999°° as “being the basis for awarding the

for these transaction, the end use of these funds, or exactly how much was paid to Datacenta” (ibid., para. 55).

Even assuming that Fraport knew of payment to Datacenta through
PIATCO’s project costs of February 7, 2002, this document is over two and a-half years
after Fraport’s Initial Investment. There is no basis in conflating PIATCO with Fraport
and asserting that even if Fraport did not know of PIATCO’s corruption, assuming such
corruption is proven (which is not regarding the concession award), its investment “is

unlawful and not protected by the Bir.

. The analysis conducted above permits the Tribunal to conclude that Jurisdictional

Objection 2 is to be dismissed, as it is hereby dismissed, due to Respondent’s failure to
provide clear and convincing evidence that Fraport was aware of and engaged in

corruption and fraud regarding Terminal 3 Project when it made its Initial Investment.

4. Jurisdictional Objection 3: Fraport Knew of PLATCO’s Misrepresentations
to Obtain the Concession Award

4.1 Respondent’s Position

. According to Respondent, PIATCO made material misrepresentations regarding its

identity and financial qualifications and obtained the concession by deceit. Neither at the
time of the bid nor after PLATCO was incorporated did PAIRCARGO & Associates,
PAGS and Security Bank meet the 30% minimum amount of equity required to undertake
the Terminal 3 Project.°” When PIATCO was incorporated on February 17, 1997, for the
purpose of constructing and operating Terminal 3, Security Bank was not among the
shareholders. On July 9, 1997, the DOTC, relying on these false misrepresentations,
issued a “Notice of Award” in favor of PLATCO.°”

°°7R. PHBL, para. 69.

*°8 Thid. Respondent’s assertion is based on the award in Alasdair Ross Anderson et al. v. Republic of Costa Rica
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/3) of May 19, 2010 (RL-109), para. 52, which, in the passage quoted by
Respondent, does not refer to the lack of knowledge of corruption as non-exempting from liability but rather to
the fact that the BIT requirement that investments must be “in accordance with the [...] law” has no regard to

“knowledge of the law” or “intention to follow the law” (which, the Tribunal notes,

is an application of the old

 

maxim according to which “ignorantia legis non excusat”).

explained that PLATCO did not meet the 30% equity requirement of PhP 3.9 billion, its
equity being deficient by PhP 2.1. Billion also because of depreciation of the Peso relative
to the U.S. dollar, the currency of the Concession. The lack of sufficient project equity
was raised also by the legal due diligence conducted for Fraport at the time by QT. Due to
PIATCO’s inability to provide the necessary equity, Fraport had to carry the project’s

equity by funding equity subscription.°!

PAIRCARGO & Associates also materially misrepresented in the financial proposal the
availability of loan facilities while no loan was ever available to PIATCO from any bank.
The lack of PIATCO’s creditworthiness was reported to Fraport in KPMG report and put
to Fraport’s Supervisory Board in January 1999 by one of its members, Mr. Werner

Schmidt, as a situation that “increases the risks of the project.”°°

Being aware of its lack of financial qualifications, PAIRCARGO wrote to PBAC on
September 10, 1996, requesting permission for each member of the Consortium to commit
to infuse the required capital to meet the minimum amount of equity. PBAC replied by
allowing that the total financial capability of all members of the Consortium be established

by the respective audited financial statements.

. According to Respondent, PBAC’s administrative decision, whatever its genesis, was

unlawful since it altered the terms of the Bid and violated the BOT law considering also
that Security Bank was no longer part of the Consortium when the latter had won the
award. Also the Agan court found that the PAIRCARGO & Associates’ pre-qualification
was unlawful because not complying with the net worth restrictions imposed by the

General Banking Act.o4

and the proposed annual guaranteed payment to the Government was based on
unrealistically high assumed figures. °° PAIRCARGO & Associates were awarded the
Concession contrary to the BOT law since the sole basis for choosing among the bids
presented was the annual guaranteed payment, which was in contradiction with the BOT

Jaw criterion for selecting the winner.°°

In sum, according to Respondent, PAIRCARGO & Associates was awarded the
Concession contrary to the BOT law and other Philippine law, based on misrepresentations
of the real identity due to Security Bank’s withdrawal, its financial ability and the ability to
manage and operate an international terminal. Fraport was informed by KPMG due

diligence report and Fraport’s Supervisory Board by Mr. Schmidt.°”

. According to Respondent, Fraport was aware at the time it made its investments that

PIATCO had misrepresented its qualifications to be a Terminal 3 concessionaire and that
both lenders and Fraport’s consultants questioned the legality of the concession award to
PIATCO. In spite of such awareness of PIATCO’s fraud, Fraport chose to proceed by

investing in PIATCO and extending to it unsecured bridge loans.°

The lenders’ concerns about PIATCO led them to impose conditions on their loans of
which Fraport became aware before investing in PIATCO, including assumption by
Fraport of full executive management and control of the Project and of the necessary
financing. The evidence shows that Fraport entered the Project and made its investment
aware of PIATCO’s misrepresentations to obtain the Concession and yet decided to cover

them up by investing in PIATCO.*!”

project debts which was known to Fraport°!! but which was expressly prohibited for

unsolicited proposal by the BOT law. °!?

The presence of this guarantee renders the
Concession Agreement invalid, as confirmed by the Philippine Supreme Court which by
the Agan decision concluded that the inclusion of such a guarantee in an unsolicited

proposal “is fatal to the proposal [...] and renders the entire contact void.”°3

. In addition, Respondent contends that the Concession Agreement was not approved by the

ICC, but merely noted,°"* and that it contained changes with respect to the draft agreement
attached to the Bid documents that were grossly disadvantageous to the Government.*!°

. In conclusion, according to Respondent, Fraport cannot claim the BIT protection since it

made its investments unlawfully having knowingly invested in an enterprise that obtained
its concession unlawfully. Since its investment was thus not accepted in accordance with

Philippine law, the BIT does not provide a basis for jurisdiction in this case.°'®

4.2 Claimant’s Position

Claimant asserts that it reasonably relied on assurances and other actions by the Philippine
Government repeatedly approving the Project. According to Respondent, it should have
instead understood the concession to be “invalid” even through the Government itself

always acted as if it were a fully legal and binding agreement.°!”

. As shown by Claimant, Respondent had “an unbroken 6-year history of administrative,

executive, legislative and judicial support at the time” it decided to invest, the termination

of the concession over three years thereafter being unexpected.°"*

It is by reason of the lack of financial ability and technical expertise of PIATCO’s
shareholders, the Chengs, that made the involvement of an experienced and financially
strong partner like Fraport an opportunity for the Project.°!” The risk Fraport assumed in
making its investment was part of the business risk and is no defense under the BIT to

Respondent's liability for expropriating the investment.”

According to Claimant, the changes to the original Bid Documents and the original
Concession Agreement criticized by Respondent were reasonable and in many cases

favorable to Respondent.”!

Respondent’s assertion that Claimant was aware when it invested in PIATCO that the
Concession and the ARCA contained a direct governmental guarantee is not supported by
contemporaneous documents. QT’s preliminary due diligence report does not raise this
issue despite referring to the ARCA provision mentioned by Respondent. Whether that
provision resulted in a governmental guarantee in breach of the BOT law is a matter of
contractual interpretation and construction of the law. Respondent’s Central Bank

a - 622
confirmed the absence of a Government guarantee.

Respondent’s assertion that the concession agreements were not properly approved
because the internal bureaucratic process had not been completed is contradicted by the
fact that they were consistently implemented, such as by Respondent’s accepting

concession payments from PIATCO. It was Respondent’s responsibility to secure the

the Supreme Court’s decision in Agan being a misapplication of

To argue that the Concession was not properly awarded to PLATCO, Respondent focuses
on narrow and technical issues, such as how the net worth of a proponent should be
accounted, an issue which was determined by PBAC in the absence of rules in the BOT
law. Fraport was entitled to rely on the record that the PAIRCARGO Consortium had
been properly pre-qualified, as confirmed by multiple agencies and officials. PIATCO’s
projected costs and revenues were not misleading, the passenger traffic forecast being
realistic as shown by the 2011 handling of 11.8 million of passengers despite an unfinished

Terminal.°°°

. There is plenty of evidence that the award of the Concession to PLATCO was endorsed at

the highest level of the administration, even while AEDC pursued the court challenge,
including by a memorandum to President Ramos of the Chief Presidential Legal

Counsel.”

. According to Claimant, Respondent should be estopped from denying the validity of the

concession agreements since it not only guaranteed their legality but actively endorsed
such legality until Terminal 3 was virtually finished. The three elements of estoppel under
international law are present in this case: (i) a statement of fact which is clear and
unambiguous; (ii) the statement is voluntary, unconditional and authorized; (iii) there was

an

period of time culminating with Fraport’s Initial Investment, facts that have intervened

subsequently having no bearing for purposes of jurisdiction.°”

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that Respondent’s contention that the Concession®” was

not properly awarded to PIATCO assumes that the alleged irregularities, even illegalities,
in the process leading to the granting of the Concession concerned solely the
PAIRCARGO Consortium, later on its successor PLATCO, while Respondent was not
accountable having no power to prevent the same. The other assumption by Respondent is
that Fraport was aware of such irregularities or even illegalities when it made its Initial

Investment. Both assumptions do not withstand scrutiny, as it shall be shown hereafter.

One of Respondent’s contentions is that the PAIRCARGO Consortium falsely
misrepresented its financial and technical qualifications, deceiving PBAC in qualifying and
eventually awarding the Concession, and that PIATCO had misrepresented its

tee te : oo. 63l
qualifications to be the Terminal 3 concessionaire.

It is not the purpose of the present analysis to establish whether Respondent is right in
alleging that the Concession was obtained by deceit by reason of these misrepresentations
but only whether and to what extent Fraport was aware of such misrepresentations,
assuming they are true, when it made its Initial Investment. It is on record that the Pre-
qualification Bids and Awards Committee (“PBAC”), the Philippine competent authority,
pre-qualified the PAIRCARGO Consortium on September 26, 1996°* and that only more

© This explains why the Tribunal’s analysis does not consider various Respondent’s arguments and related
evidence.

9 The Concession was granted under a Concession Agreement signed on July 12, 1997 between the Government
and PIATCO, amended on November 1998 by the Amended and Restated Concession Agreement (“ARCA”).
See supra para. 95.

°! Respondent evidently conflates the PAIRCARGO Consortium with PIATCO, the latter having been
incorporated by the former to be then granted the Concession.

632

Respondent asserts that “PBAC prequalified unlawfully Paircargo & Associated” mentioning that “there is
substantive evidence that PBAC members, Pantaleon Alvarez and Wilfredo Trinidad, were corrupted” (C-Mem.,
para. 66). The fact remains that, as mentioned by Respondent, only with the Supreme Court's decision in Agan v.

159

508.

than seven years later, on January 21, 2004, the pre-qualification was found unlawful by
the Philippine Supreme Court. Thus, based on the record of this proceeding what Fraport
knew at the time of its Initial Investment was that the PAIRCARGO Consortium, i.e.
PIATCO, had been pre-qualified and that such pre-qualification had not been challenged

by any competent Philippine authority.

PIATCO’s lack of financial and technical qualifications to construct and operate the
Terminal 3 was known and had been the main worry of prospective lenders to the Project.
Fraport had been made aware of the lack of PLATCO’s financial qualifications, this being
the main reason for its proposed involvement in the Terminal 3 Project. Fraport had been
so informed by KPMG due diligence report on PIATCO of January 20, 1999 (“KPMG

633

Report”). Having noted the shortfall in required equity contribution and the

insufficiency of cash balance for 1999, the KPMG Report mentions “the possible outcome
of prospective investor’s entity to the Company thereby bringing in fresh funds.” 4
Despite the indicated shortfall and some reservations regarding revenue projections (that
“may be overstated”), the KPMG Report’s overall assessment is that the “[p]roject appears
to be an attractive investment considering that the financial projections by themselves

appear reasonable.”°*

A Preliminary Due Diligence Report on PIATCO dated December 29, 1998, was
transmitted to Fraport by QT on January 11, 1999 (“QT Report”). °%° The QT Report
describes in detail the regulatory environment of the proposed acquisition by Fraport of an
interest in PIATCO (defined as the “Company’) as holder of a “public utility” in the
Philippines, including the Foreign Investment Act of 1991, as amended, and the Anti-

Dummy Law.

PIATCO the pre-qualification of Paircargo & Associates was found “unlawful because it did not take into account
the restrictions imposed by the General Banking Act” (ibid., para. 68).

509. The Preliminary Executive Summary of QT Report indicates issues of concern, among

51

which, Fraport’s attention is specifically called to the ADL,“” to the status of approval of
the Concession Agreement and the ARCA 638 and the financial exposure of a new
shareholder.°° No mention is made in the QT Report of issues raised by Respondent
regarding the Concession having been obtained by misrepresentations. Whether or not this
was due to these issues not being part of the “Disclosure Material” (as defined therein) on
which the QT Report is based is irrelevant, what matters being that no knowledge of the

issues in question may be imputed to Fraport by reason of the QT Report.

Respondent indicates as a further reason of illegality the presence in Section 4.04(c)(iv) of
the Concession Agreement and the ARCA of a direct Government guarantee in violation of

the BOT law in the case of unsolicited BOT projects.

Whether Fraport was aware of the
clause in the Concession Agreement and the ARCA regarding the alleged Government
guarantee or of the 1998 communications between PIATCO and its potential lenders

allegedly relating to Section 4.04%! remains unproven.

. According to Respondent, the lenders’ correspondence in late 1998 and early 1999 would

have raised “concerns about the provisions in the Concession Agreement and Section
4.04(c) of the ARCA.” Fraport would have been aware of the content of such
correspondence since during that period “it was meeting and discussing almost every
aspect of the project with lenders and PIATCO.”*? More particularly, Fraport’s awareness
would be based on a memorandum raising the problem that “‘a direct buy-out between the
GRP and the Senior Lenders might constitute a direct guarantee” would have been shared

also with Fraport’s bankers, KfW and that, as mentioned in a letter of May 7, 1999, from

7 Supra, para. 431.

earlier (supra, para. 498).

© As mentioned by Claimant, the Philippine Central Bank confirmed in a letter to PIATCO of Aug. 2, 2001 that
Section 4.04 does not constitute a Government guarantee (Rep., para. 106). See supra, fn. 56.

PIATCO to the ADB, “FAG is currently discussing with KfW regarding the finance
plan.” Despite Respondent’s efforts to a link together these various passages, there is no
clear evidence that Fraport was aware of the problem of a direct Government guarantee at
the time of its Initial Investment. The QT Report does not raise concerns regarding the

Government guarantee allegedly provided by the Concession Agreement and the ARCA.

Sl

Respondent further contends that Fraport was aware that the 1997 Concession Agreement
had not been approved by the ICC “but merely noted,” that the ARCA had been
conditionally approved and that the DOTC signers may not have had authority to sign the

agreements.“

513. At the time of its Initial Investment, Fraport was aware that the process of approval of the

ARCA was still under way. As mentioned by the QT Report,

The Company and the GRP has [sic] executed an Amendment and Restated
Concession Agreement. However, we understand that the ICC/NEDA has not
yet approved this Amended and Restated Concession Agreement. The BOT
Law requires that unsolicited proposals shall be submitted to the ICC upon
official endorsement by the head of the concerned agency. The ICC shall
approve the project scope in accordance with the guidelines of the BOT Law.
Although the Original Concession Agreement has been submitted to and noted
by the ICC/NEDA, the Amended and Restated Concession has not been
approved by the ICC/NEDA. However, we understand that the Amended and
Restated Concession Agreement has already been endorsed by the
DOTC/MIAA to the ICC/NEDA. The Company should pursue the
application for approval of the Amended and Restated Concession Agreement
with the ICC/NEDA.“*°

514. The NEDA Board approved the ARCA by Resolution of August 19, 1999, mentioning that

such approval “is with the understanding that the credit agreement between the

concessionaire and the senior lenders shall be subject to the approval and monitoring of the

Bangko Sentral un Philiponas” [i.e., the Philippine Central Bank].%°

. Regarding authority to sign the Concession Agreement, the QT Report advised Fraport as

follows:

Although the authority of the DOTC Secretary to sign the Concession
Agreement on behalf of the GRP may be presumed, to avoid issue it is
advisable to obtain a certification signed by the President of the Republic of
the Philippines attesting to the authority of the signatories to the Concession
Agreement to sign the Concession Agreement on behalf of the GRP.”

It is not the scope of this analysis to go through the intricacies of the Philippine
administrative process of approval of Government agreements such as the Concession
Agreement or the ARCA. This, particularly in view of the thoroughly divergent opinions
on the subject expressed by experts of both Parties. What matters for purposes of the
present analysis is that, at the time of its Initial Investment, Fraport was aware that the
approval process was ongoing and that nothing led to believe that there would have been

problems in completing the process.

The following remarks are meant to be dispositive of the issues raised by Respondent in
Jurisdictional Objection 3. Respondent supported the Terminal 3 Project from the very
beginning, as shown by President Ramos Memorandum in October 1997 to various
Departments and Authorities directing the Project to be “fast tracked.” 8 President
Estrada confirmed the Philippine Government commitment “to the fulfilment of all its
obligations under the Concession Agreement dated July 12, 1997 (as amended and restated
on November 26, 1998) with the Philippine International Air Terminal Co.,” directing all
pertinent Government agencies and officers to engage their full cooperation “in ensuring

into completion of the said project within the timetable set.” In the Philippine press

Respondent praised Fraport’s participation in the project as a partner “known the world

over for efficiency in airport management.”°”

. For over five years, until November 2002,°°! Respondent supported the Project without
raising any objections to the validity of the Concessions Agreement, rather encouraging

Fraport to continue investing in the Project. 652

Many Government Officials’ actions
confirmed or approved during the same period the legality of the award of the concession
to PIATCO and the related contracts. In reliance on the Government’s support of the
Project, Fraport invested in the Project in July 1999 and continued to invest thereafter. On
its side, the Government showed to consider the Concession valid by accepting payment of

the annual contribution provided thereunder.

. In light of the above analysis and after careful review of the Parties’ arguments and the
related evidence, the Tribunal concludes that Jurisdictional Objection 3 is to be dismissed
for lack of evidence of Fraport’s knowledge at the time of its Initial Investment of

Respondent’s alleged misrepresentations by PIATCO to obtain the Concession.
COSTS

A. The Parties’ Positions

The Parties filed simultaneous submissions on costs on May 2, 2014, and simultaneous

reply submissions on costs on May 19, 2014.

. In its submission on costs, Claimant argued that Respondent should be held accountable in
bearing the total arbitration costs incurred by Claimant, including legal fees and expenses,
in the total amount of EU 5.028.962,32, US $12,386,291.80 and GBP 148,309.62.

Claimant made its claim on the basis of (i) Respondent’s insertion of preliminary phase

submission in the proceeding; (ii) abuse of evidence exchange by Respondent through the
request to Claimant to produce more than 110.000 pages and the submission of a great
number of witness statements and facts exhibits; (iii) Respondent’s ad hominem and
baseless attacks on Fraport; (iv) Respondent’s generation of immense record to obfuscate

the legally relevant facts; and (iv) the injection of irrelevant issues by Respondent.

In its submission on costs, Respondent requested that Claimant bear all costs incurred by
Respondent in this arbitration proceeding, which includes a total of US $11,908,679.26 of
legal fees, and a total of US $3,254,138.68 of costs and expenses (through April 2, 2014)
including fees of Respondent’s experts and consultants (US $1,740,153.22). 654
Respondent made its claim on the basis of (i) the reasonability of its request for costs; (ii)
the alleged illegality engaged by Fraport; and (iii) the exacerbation of its costs as a result of

Fraport’s procedural misconduct.

. In its reply submission on costs, Claimant opposed Respondent’s request for costs and

rebutted Respondent's basis for its request.

In its reply submission on costs, Respondent requested that the Tribunal reject Claimant’s
application for cost, and further updated its arbitration costs incurred with a total of US
$11,910,321.79 of legal fees, and a total of US $3,465,667.34 of costs and expenses
including an updated amount of fees of Respondent’s experts and consultants (US

$1,740,204.70).

B. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal has the power to order costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention,

which provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with
the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees
and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of

the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the
award.

It is recognized that in awarding costs the Tribunal enjoys broad discretion, subject to the
exercise of discretion being explained, as required by Article 48(3) providing that “[t]he
award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons

upon which it is based.”®°

6. The Tribunal notes that while the traditional position in investment arbitration has been
that the parties bear their own legal costs and share equally the costs of the arbitration,
there have been a number of cases which have departed from this principle and have
awarded costs on a “loser pays” basis. The Tribunal finds that, in the circumstances of this
particular arbitration, the application of the “loser pays” principle is appropriate to a certain
extent. The Tribunal does not believe that either Party’s procedural conduct should be an
additional basis for awarding costs, the complexity of the case and the sensitivity of many
of the issues involved explaining the extraordinary amount of the evidence produced, part

of which had already been filed in the prior ICSID and ICC cases.

7. The outcome of the case has been in Respondent’s favor, the Tribunal having accepted one
of the three jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent, resulting in the lack of
jurisdiction over Claimant’s claims. The Tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction regarding
Claimant’s claims has determined the lack of jurisdiction also regarding Respondent’s
counterclaims due to the latter’s connection with the subject matter of the dispute.
However, dealing with Respondent’s counterclaims has not required significant

developments and production of evidence by either Party.

~

In view of the outcome of the case, the Tribunal considers appropriate that Claimant
reimburse Respondent for part of the latter’s fees and costs in the amount of US $5 million.
The Tribunal additionally considers appropriate that each Party shall bear in full all other
legal fees and costs it has incurred and equally share the fees and expenses of the Tribunal

and the costs of the ICSID Secretariat.

of the Tribunal.
2. Claimant shall pay Respondent US $5 million as part of the latter’s fees and costs.

3. Each Party shall bear in full all other legal fees and costs it has incurred and equally

share the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the ICSID Secretariat.

as the account is finalized.

°57 On December 1, 2014, the Hearing related expenses (US $149,942) and other expenses were estimated to
amount to US $164,000. This amount includes estimated charges (courier, printing and copying) in respect of the
dispatch of this Award. The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments
advanced to ICSID.
