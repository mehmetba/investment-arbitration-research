PETITION FOR

v.
THE REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA,

Defendant.

eS SSeS SH HHL

Petitioner Blue Ridge Investments, L.L.C. (“Blue Ridge”), through its attorneys, Crowell
& Moring LLP, hereby alleges, with knowledge as to its own acts and upon information and
belief as to the acts of others, as follows:

Introduction

1. This is an action to confirm an arbitration award pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a
and Article 54 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and
Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID Convention”), and to enter judgment thereon. The
arbitration award (the “Award”) was rendered in favor of CMS Gas Transmission Company
(“CMS” or “the Company”) against the Republic of Argentina (“Argentina”) on May 12, 2005,
following an arbitration conducted in Washington, D.C. under the rules of the International
Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”). Blue Ridge is the successor in
interest to CMS, having notified Argentina of the purchase and assignment on June 5, 2008.

Jurisdiction and Venue

2. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330 and

22 U.S.C. § 1650a.

3. Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(d).

Parties

4. Petitioner Blue Ridge is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, and
is the purchaser and assignee of the Award rendered in favor of CMS.

5. Respondent is Argentina.

The Award

6. On July 26, 2001, CMS filed a Request for Arbitration with ICSID against
Argentina. The subject matter of the arbitration dealt with the suspension by Argentina of a
tariff adjustment formula for gas transportation applicable to an enterprise in which CMS had an
investment.

7. On May 12, 2005, in the matter of CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The
Argentine Republic, the ICSID tribunal issued a final award in CMS’s favor in the amount of
$133.2 million. The tribunal found that Argentina breached its obligations to CMS, as a U.S.-
protected investor in Argentina, under the bilateral investment treaty between the U.S. and
Argentina and the ICSID Convention.

8. On September 8, 2005, Argentina filed with the Secretary-General of ICSID an
application requesting annulment of the Award. On September 25, 2007, the ad-hoc ICSID
Annulment Committee confirmed Argentina’s obligation to pay CMS $133.2 million plus
interest in compensation, holding that “payment by Argentina of the sum awarded is again
obligatory.”

9. Accordingly, Argentina has no further legal recourse to avoid paying $133.2
million, plus interest, to Blue Ridge, as successor in interest to CMS.

10. Argentina itself has recognized its obligation to pay. The current Procurador del

Tesoro de la Nacion, Mr. Osvaldo Ceas Guglielmino, provided, on behalf of Argentina:

 

Case 1:10-cv-00153-PGG Document 1 Filed 01/08/2010 .Page 3 of 4

an undertaking to CMS Gas Transmission Company that, in accordance with its

obligations under the ICSID Convention, it will recognize the award rendered by

the Arbitral Tribunal as binding and will enforce the pecuniary obligations

imposed by that award within its territories, in the event that annulment is not

granted,

11. The ICSID Convention is clear in stating that any ICSID award not annulled in
ICSID annulment proceedings — such as the Award in this case — is final and binding. Each
ICSID member owes an obligation to all other member states to comply with a final ICSID
award.

12. Despite this indisputable obligation, Argentina has attempted to raise a number of
arguments in an effort to avoid payment of the Award. Most recently, Argentina has taken the
position that Blue Ridge must enforce the Award in the local courts of Argentina, even though
the ICSID system is specifically designed to avoid reliance on local courts to enforce an award.
Blue Ridge believes that, by doing so, Argentina hopes to use local courts to review the final
ICSID award and, at the very least, delay payment by several years.

13. In short, Argentina has exhausted all legal avenues to resist Blue Ridge’s claim
and its obligation to comply with the Award, and is in breach of its obligations under the U.S.-
Argentina bilateral investment treaty and the ICSID Convention.

Cause of Action

14. Blue Ridge repeats and realleges the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 to 13
as if fully set forth herein.

15. The United States and Argentina are signatories to the ICSID Convention.

Awards issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention are subject to automatic recognition and

enforcement in the United States under 22 U.S.C. § 1650a.

16. An arbitration award under the ICSID Convention has been issued in CMS’s
favor and assigned properly to Blue Ridge.

17. Accordingly, Blue Ridge is entitled to an order confirming such arbitral award
pursuant to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention and 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, and entering judgment
thereon in the amount of $133.2 million, plus interest.

Prayer for Relief

WHEREFORE, Blue Ridge respectfully asks the Court to enter judgment:

(a) Confirming the May 12, 2005 Award of the ICSID arbitration tribunal in
favor of CMS against Argentina, pursuant to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention and 22 U.S.C.
§ 1650a;

(b) | Awarding Blue Ridge, as successor in interest to CMS, the sum of $133.2
million, plus interest from the date of May 12, 2005;

(c) Awarding Blue Ridge its costs in this action, including reasonable
attorneys’ fees and disbursements;

(d) Granting such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and
proper.
