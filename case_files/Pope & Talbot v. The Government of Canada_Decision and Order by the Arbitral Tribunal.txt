DECISION AND ORDER BY THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL
Ta
NAETA UNCITRAL INVESTOR-STATE CLAIM
Pope & Talbot, Inc. and Government of Canad

1. On Pebruary 22, 2002, the Investor advised the Tribunal that, on February 6, 2002,
Canada gave notice of its invention to disclose various documents that had been
previously submitted to the Tribunal. Canada gave notice pursuant to Procedural
Order on Confidentiality No. §, thereby acknowlodging that the documents in question
were subject to that Order. Canada said it was acting in response to a request under its
Access to Information Act {“ATIA”},' which it contended required disclosure unless the
docuzuents fall within an exemption to the Act, which Canada denies. Canada further
stated thac it intended tn release the documents 30 days after its notification (March 8,
2002}, presumably in compliance with paragraph 5 of Order No. 5. (Canada forwarded
copies of the d in to the , wad the f ded those
documents to the Tribunal with the hard copy of its faxed letter of February 22.)

2. By way of relief, the Investor requested the Tribunal to “make a declaration clarifying, if

 

necessary,” Order No. 5, and to “urge...Canada not to release protected documents.”
The Investor stated that, with the March 8, 2002 deadline, time was of the essence.
3. Canade waited until February 28, 2002 to answer the Investor's request. That answer
recounts the requisements of Order No, 5 and asserts that it permits disclosure under
domestic Canadian law. Further, Canada asserts that neither the Order nor the
UNCITRAL Rules (under which this arbitration is being conducted) “could purport to

affect or modify stanutorily mandated disclosure requirements.” Canada relies expreasly
on paragraph 5 of Order No. 5 and on Notes of Interpretation issued by the NAPTA
Free Trade Commission, 23 well as three rulings by other Chapter 11 tribunals. Finally,
Canada contests the Investor's suggestion that any cxemption under the ATIA would
apply to the documents in question.

4. Canada’s submission does not dispute that the Investor has provided the Tribunal with
copies of the documents in question. The Tribunal therefore proceeds on the basis that
those documents represent the universe it had been asked to consider. The Tribunal
notes that, in one important respect, Canada’s description (in its February 6, 2002
notification} of the documents as “certain documents submitted to the Pope & Talbot

 

 

Tribal,” is not fully In fact, the di include of t
which are not submissions at all.

DISCUSSION SND RULING

5. Asticle 105 of NAFTA requires Canada to ensure that all necessary measures are taken
t0 give effect to the p: of the A Article 1120 provides that a di

investor may submit its claim to arbitration under, inter alia, the UNCITRAL Rules,
and, further, provides that “The applicable arbitration rules shall govern the arbitration
carept to the extent modified by this Section.” There has been no suggestion that the
cited Section has modified the UNCITRAL Rules in sny way material to this
discussion.

6. The UNCITRAL Rules provide in Article 15{1) that the tribunal may conduct the

 

bitration in such as it id ‘iate, provid. d the parties are treated
with equality. Article 25(4) of the Rules provides, inter alia: “Hearings shall be held iz7
camera unless the parties agree otherwise.” The parties here have noe agreed otherwise.

7. Following these precepes and, importantly, ac the request of both parties, the Tribunal
made Procedural Order No, 5 on December 17, 1999, The parties had been unable to
reach complete agreement on # confidentiality order and each party submitted variants
to a common draft. In these respects, it was left to the Tribunal to resolve those
differences.

9. Procedural Order No. § was first modified on April 2, 2000 in relation to its paragraphs
10 and 21 so that Caneda might make certain confidential information evuilable to
cextain persons. That modification was made upon the condition that the infonnation
would remain confidential within that sdditiona] class of persons and was to be used for
a limited purpose. Specifically, those edditional persons would be required vo execute a
confidentiality agreement in the terms specified in the Order.

10, On July 31, 2001, the NAFTA Free Trade Commission iseued an interpretation of
Chapter 31 which inchided the following language:

A, Access to documents

1. Nothing in the NAFTA imposes @ geueral duty of confidentiality on tha

(iii) Information which the Party must withhold purmuant to the relevant
arbitral rules, as applied.

11, Based wpon its submissions, Canada accepts that the documents in question are to be
treated pursuant to paragraph 5 of Order No. 5, That is the plain intention of the
Order, since those documeats largely fall under paragraph 2 of the Order, which
expressly requizes such treatment. The question taised by Canada’s actions in this
matter is whether the ATIA makes the remainder of Order No. § inapplicable, once the
80 day (naw 60 day} notice procedures have been followed.*

law. In the course of negptisting the terms of Order No. 5, Canada did propose an
express provision that would have made it “without prejudice to the rights, duties and
obligations of Cansda under its laws " " * including the Access to Information Act.*
The Tribunal rejected that proposal. For this reason, the Tribunal rejects Canada’s
contention that the Order expressly recognizes disclosure under the ATIA.

To the exrent that Canade claims that Order No. 5 implicitly recognizes disclosuze
putsuant to domestic law, the Tribunal points out that the Order plainly contemplates
thar disputes over release of documents will be determined by the Tribunal, not that a
party may release documents absent approval. Canada has not sought such approval.
Canada makes reference to the Interpretation of the NAFTA Free Trade Commission
pet out above, arguing that nothing in Chapter 11 imposes a general duty of
confidentiality. This is true, but the remainder of the Interpretation shows that the
NAFTA Parties fully recognized that there may well be specific requirements of
confidentiality that invre im the Chapter }1 process. Of course, Order No. 5 is such a
specific requirement. It was not a product of a general requirement of confidentiality
but of an agreement between the parties, adopted by the Tribunal, regarding appropriate
treacment of submissions and other documents,’

 

s

Canada’s fax to the Tribunal, Nov. 18, 1999.
While Canada would have preferred that pre-h da and

motions to the Tribunal not be included in the Order, the reason ft gave for thac preference wes
that the dectsion of thelr treatment was “premature and turns on the contents of the
document.” See Canada’s letter to the Tribunal dated Nov. 19, 1999. In other words,
Canada’s f ized that those di could, in it chose
not to enumerate, properly be considered as confidential The Tsbunal’s decision to issue a

sive order that would avoid document-by-document rulings did no violence to

comprehen:
Canada’s views in this respect.

The Tribunal observes that the Interpretation applies only to documents “submitted to,
or issued by, a Chapter Eleven tribunal.” Certain of the material that Cansda proposes
to make public are not either, but are transcripts of the hearings. To the same point,
the Inerpretation recognizes that the erbitral rules referred to in Article 1120{2) may
set forth specific exceptions that may preclude disclosure. As noted, the UNCITRAL

 

Rules do contain « specific provisi izing in camera hearings, unless the parties
agree otherwise. That exception would surely cover transcripts of those hearings.
The ion also requi i. “9 infr ton the [NAFTA] Party must

 

withhold pursuant to the relevant esbitral rules, a8 applied.” Article 15 of the
UNCITRAL Rules gives a tribunal authority to “conduct the arbitration in such manner
as {t considers appropriate,” making Order No. 5 a plain application of those Rules and
chus within the language of the Interpretation.’ Finally, the Interpretation was issued
some seven months ago, and Canada has never suggested that it requires amendment
of or, indeed, has any bearing on Order No, 5."

For these reasons, the Tribunal rejects Canada’s suggestion that the Interpretation.
requires disclosure under the ATIA. Indeed, the Tribunal views as the beter argument
that the Interpretation recognizes the validity of Order No. 5 as binding on Canada.
At bottom, Canada argues thar, under the ATIA, any citizen or permanent resident of
Canada, simply by Gling e writren request, must be given access to information

 

e

Article 15 of the UNCITRAL Rules aleo requires that the parcies be “created with

equality,” thereby raising questions ebout an interpretation that would remove onfy the
NAFTA disputing party but not the investor from confidentiality restraints. In yiew of its
other determinatio:

otherwise provected by Order No. 5.° If that interprecasion of the Act is correct, the
Tribunal finds it difficult to understand how Canada could have accepted in good faith
the undertakings in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Order No. 5 (muck of which was contained
in Canada’s own proposed order} and, indeed, of NAFTA itself. As 2 Party ® NAFTA,
Cunada pledged to foilow the UNCITRAL Rules where, as here, they have been properly
invoked in a Chapter 11 arbitration. As noved, those rules require m1 camera bearings.
Yet Canada now seems to be saying that thac undertaking may be disregarded in the
face of a request for hearing transcripts under the ATIA and that that step may be taken
without even making a submission to the Tribunal. This Tribunal has no expertise to
interpret the ATIA, but it can state that making these documents public will not only
violate Order No. 5 but NAFTA itself,
Canada bas drawn the Tribunal’s attention to three decisions of other Chapter 11
tribunals that, it claims support its views. The first ruling, in Mondev Intemational,
Led. and United States, concerned release under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act’
of submissions by the United States to the tribunal and certain letters it wrote to the
claimant's counsel and the tribunal. The Mandev tribunal makes no seference to
confidentiality order in that case, 56 the Tribunal assumes there was none, Thus, the
tion for decision was whether the ICSID (Additional Facility) Rules, under which
that ion p ded, required non disci The tribunal found no such

 

provision in those rules, which only call for whet amounts to in camera bearings - 10

the disputing parties. Thus, the tribunal in Mondev had no occasion to address the
issues presented here,

The Tribunal is not sure why Canada would zely on the eribunzl’s milings in Loewen
and United States. Those decisions involve release of minutes and audio recordings of a
hearing The tribunel ruled thet the ICSID (AF} Rules regarding non disclosure of
hearing minutes applied to parties, not fuse the tribunal, and that those rules prohibited
publication of hearing minutes, @ full record of the hearing and any order made by the
tribunal. It was only after reaching that ination that the tribunal ot d, as
dicta, that ite dectsion could not alter statutory imposed obligations regarding
disclosure. To the Tribunal, the Loewen decisions are perfectly cansistent with the

The tribuaal did find that discloaure by the claimant of specific time limits apparently
discaseed in the hearing was a technical violation of the ICSID (AF) Rules, but not
serlous enough to warrant a protective order. Thus, Metaiciad, like Mondev, simply
does not raise the issues presented here.

Any reports, submissions, i 1 da, d ion papers,
research papers, analyses, studies, opinions or ary other information prepared
by Canada, the United States and/or Mexico from October 1, 1996 to present
roncerning [various aspects of NAFTA Chapter 11). [Emphasis added.]
The request was dated December 6, 2000, mare than 15 months ago.
Insofar as the ial ded to be disclosed by Canada inchides parts of hearing
transcripts (Items 8, 9, and 10 of Appendix One hereto and a separate copy of pages
536, 537, 539 and 541), they cannot reasonably be said to be “prepared by” Canada or

the other NAFTA Parties. Since those documents were not requested under the ATLA,

 

theiy disclosure could not be justified by the requirements of that statute. Canada’s
failure promptly to apprise the Tribunal of the request has thus urinecessarily placed it
tn peril of violating its obligations under Order No. 5.
The Tribunal also notes that, to the extent Canada hae urged time iimitattons imposed
by the ATIA as justification for {ts actions in this matter, the deadline fixed for
disclosure under that act was Novernber 19, 2001. After that date, Canadas was
accordingly deemed under the ATIA to have refused to comply with its disclosure
obligations. Catiada has also asserted that it had no discretion to extend the time limit.
The Tribunal observes that, when it first notified the Investor on February 6, 2002 of
its intent to disclose, Canada was already in breach of the time limit with purportedly
no discretion after November 19, 2001 to delay further. Yet it relied on paragraph 5 of
Procedura] Order No. 5 nevertheless to extend that period. The Tribunal finds tt
difficult to sec why Canada did not rely on the further request by the Tribunal to extend
the period again.
For these reasons, the Tribunal declares as follows:
1. The documents referred to in Appendix One hereto are confidential documents
failing within paragxaphe | and 2 of the Procedural Order on Confidentialiry No.
