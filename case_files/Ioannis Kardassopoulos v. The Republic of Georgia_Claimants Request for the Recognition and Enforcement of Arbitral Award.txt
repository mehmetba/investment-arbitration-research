Plaintiffs IOANNIS KARDASSOPOULOS and RON FUCHS (collectively “Plaintiffs”),
by their attorneys Blank Rome LLP, complaining of the above-named Defendant THE
REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA (“Georgia” or Defendant”), allege upon information and belief as
follows:

1, This is an action for the recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award
issued by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”), 1818H
Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20433 on March 3, 2010 in favor of Plaintiffs and against
Defendant (the “Award”).

PARTIES AND JURISDICTION

2. Plaintiff Ioannis Kardassopoulos (“Kardassopoulos”) is a citizen of

Greece.

3. Plaintiff Ron Fuchs (“Fuchs”) is a citizen of Israel.

900200.00001/22076264v.1

4, Defendant is a foreign state.

5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action to recognize and
enforce the Award pursuant to the “Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Act of
1966”, 17 U.S.T. 1270, 575 U.N.T.S. 159 (“Convention”) and 22 U.S.C. § 1650a (a) and (b).

6. The Court has personal jurisdiction over Georgia pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §
1330(a).

7. Plaintiffs will serve Georgia with a copy of the summons and verified
complaint, and such other required documents, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1608.

THE UNDERLYING DISPUTE

8. After achieving independence from the Soviet Union in April, 1991,
Georgia sought investments to develop a transit corridor to transport oil and gas from Azerbaijan
to the Black Sea, known as the “Western Route.”

9. In furtherance of that goal, Georgia’s state-owned oil company,
SakNavtobi, entered into a joint venture Agreement dated March 3, 1992 (“Joint Venture”) with
Tramex International Inc., a company jointly owned by Plaintiffs. The Joint Venture provided
for, among other things, “the sole and exclusive right of first refusal in the Republic of Georgia
to participate or implement any other Oil and Gas related projects in the Republic of Georgia.”
Joint Venture Agreement, § 3.6. The Joint Venture further provided: “All property owned,
leased or used by the Joint Venture is not subject to expropriation, confiscation or
nationalization.” Id., { 12.1

10. On February 20, 1996, Georgia cancelled “all rights (given earlier by the

Georgian government to any of the parties)” and expropriated the entire Joint Venture.

900200.00001/22076264v.1

THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS
11. After years of negotiating potential payments to Plaintiffs as a result of
Georgia’s expropriation, Plaintiffs submitted separate requests for arbitration to the ICSID. On
September 14, 2007 ICSID confirmed that both arbitration proceedings would run concurrently
and be heard together.

12. ICSID issued the Award which awarded:

(a) Kardassopoulos and Fuchs $15.1 million each;

(b) _ Interest on the principal sums awarded from February 20, 1996 to
February 28, 2010 in the amount of $30,024,736.83 each for a total sum
payable to each $45,124,736.83;

(c) Interest on the principal sums at the rate of LIBOR in effect at the date of
issuance of the Award plus four percent (4%), compounded semi-annually
from the date of issuance of the Award at the six-month term LIBOR rate
for U.S. dollar deposits published by the Wall Street Journal, plus four
percent (4%), and such interest rate reset semi-annually to the current six-
month LIBOR rate in effect each January 1 and July 1 until such time as
the Award is satisfied in full;

(d) Costs of the ICSID arbitration in the total sum of $7,942,297.

13. Following the issuance of the Award, Georgia filed successive

applications to annul and/or revise the Award and obtained a provisional stay in January, 2011,
conditioned on Georgia posting an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee (“Guarantee”)
in the amount of $50 million. On June 7, 2011, after Georgia wrote to confirm that it would not

post the Guarantee, ICSID by decision dated June 7, 2011 terminated the stay.

900200.00001/22076264v.1

COUNT I
FOR RECOGNITION OF THE AWARD

14. Plaintiffs repeat paragraphs 1 through 13 as if set forth in full here.
15. The United States, where the Award was issued, Israel and Greece, the
countries of which Plaintiffs are citizens, and Georgia are all signatories of the Convention.
16. 22 U.S.C. § 1650a governs “Arbitration awards under the Convention”
and provides:
An award of an arbitral tribunal rendered to chapter IV of the
[C]onvention shall create a right arising under a treaty of the
United States. The pecuniary obligations imposed by such an
award shall be enforced and shall be given the same full faith and
credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court of general
jurisdiction of one of the several States. The Federal Arbitration
Act (9 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) shall not apply to enforcement of awards
rendered pursuant to the [C]onvention.
17. Plaintiffs seek recognition and enforcement of the Award as a money judgment of
this Court.
18. France, The Netherlands, and The United Kingdom are also signatories to the

Convention, and have recognized the Award as a judgment pursuant to Article 54 thereof.

900200.0000 1/22076264v.1

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request the following relief: (1) An order recognizing the

Award as a judgment of this Court in the amounts set forth therein; (2) costs incurred in this

f-

and
