Re: Abaclat and others y. Argentine Republic

(ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5)

Dear Mesdames and Sirs,

On September 15, 2011, the Argentine Republic, Respondent in the above case,
submitted a Request for the Disqualification of President Pierre Tercier and arbitrator

Albert Jan van den Berg (the Request).

The Request was submitted pursuant to Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID
Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Pursuant to Article 57, a party
may propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on account of any fact indicating a
manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1).

Pursuant to Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9, it
falls upon the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council to decide the Request.

2 December 21, 2011

By letter of October 28, 2011, the parties were informed of my decision to seek a
recommendation on the Request from the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of
Arbitration at The Hague. By same letter, the parties were reminded that this request was
exceptional, that it should not be construed as a basis for any future similar request, and
that the final decision on the Request would remain with the Chairman of the ICSID
Administrative Council.

The parties have been given a full opportunity to present their positions on this
matter and the Centre provided the Permanent Court of Arbitration with copies of all
communications submitted by the parties following the filing of the Request and of the
explanations furnished by the arbitrators whose disqualification is proposed.

The recommendation from the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of
Arbitration was received by ICSID on December 19, 2011. A copy of the
recommendation is attached,

I have carefully considered the Request, in light of the parties’ written arguments,
the arbitrators’ explanations, and the recommendation from the Secretary-General of the
Permanent Court of Arbitration. Based on the materials submitted, I have reached the
conclusion that the Argentine Republic’s Request for the Disqualification of President
Pierre Tercier and arbitrator Albert Jan van den Berg of September 15, 2011 does not
meet the standard set forth in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention for the disqualification
of an arbitrator.

Accordingly the Argentine Republic’s Request for the Disqualification of
President Pierre Tercier and arbitrator Albert Jan van den Berg is hereby rejected.

Sincerely yours,

(

istrative Council
