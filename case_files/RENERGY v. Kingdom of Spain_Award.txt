The present dispute was submitted by the Claimant to the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty
(“ECT”) and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of Other States (“ICSID Convention”).

The dispute relates to the regulatory framework for renewable energy production in Spain,
in particular certain measures that the legislative and executive branches of the Respondent
and its autonomous community Castile and Leén took between February 2012 and October
2014 (“Disputed Measures”). The Claimant submits that the Disputed Measures violated
the ECT and caused significant harm to its investment in certain wind farms and
concentrated solar power (“CSP”) plants.

In view of the many other arbitrations concerning some or all of the Disputed Measures,
the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that the factual submissions, legal arguments and
evidence before the respective tribunals were different in each case. Such differences can
result in different outcomes. The Tribunal bases its decision exclusively on the record of
this arbitration.

Moreover, the Tribunal wishes to stress that its use of one Party’s terminology does not in
any way reflect the Tribunal’s understanding of a particular issue. Similarly, the order in
which references are presented is not a reflection of a source’s value in the eyes of the
Tribunal, and the references do not purport to include all relevant sources from the
extensive record in this arbitration.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Registration and constitution of the Tribunal

On 25 July 2014, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 22 July 2014 from the
Claimant against the Respondent (“Request”).

On 1 August 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. The
Secretary-General invited the Parties to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible
in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of
Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

On 3 October 2014, the Parties informed the Centre of their agreement as to the number of

arbitrators and the method for the Tribunal’s constitution. Pursuant to this agreement, the
Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third,
presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.

On 9 October 2014, following appointment by the Claimant, Professor Christoph Schreuer,
a national of Austria, accepted his appointment as co-arbitrator.

On 9 November 2014, following appointment by the Respondent, Professor Philippe Sands
QC, a national of Great Britain and France accepted his appointment as co-arbitrator.

On 13 February 2015, following the agreement of the Parties, Judge Bruno Simma, a
national of Austria and Germany, accepted his appointment as President of the Tribunal.

On 13 February 2015, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID
Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (“ICSID Arbitration Rules”), notified the
Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and the Tribunal was
therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Anneliese Fleckestein,' ICSID
Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

First Session

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the
Parties on 29 April 2015, by teleconference.

During the first session, the President of the Tribunal proposed that Mr. Heiner Kahlert, an
attorney with Martens Rechtsanwilte in Munich, be appointed as his assistant. By letters
of 29 May 2015, the Parties confirmed their agreement with the appointment of
Mr. Kahlert.

Following the first session, on 1 June 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1
recording the agreements of the Parties on procedural matters and the decisions of the
Tribunal. Procedural Order No. | provides, inter alia, that the applicable ICSID Arbitration
Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural language would be
English and Spanish, and that the place of proceeding would be Washington D.C., U.S.A.
Procedural Order No. 1 also set out the agreed procedural calendar to this arbitration,
included as Annex A to that order.

The European Commission’s First Application to Intervene

Prior to the Tribunal’s constitution, on 14 November 2014, the European Commission
(“EC”) filed an application for leave to intervene as a non-disputing party pursuant to
ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2).

' On 20 March 2015, ICSID notified the Tribunal and the Parties that Ms. Luisa Fernanda Torres, ICSID Legal
Counsel, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal temporarily while Ms. Anneliese Fleckenstein was on maternity

leave.

23

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal —once constituted— invited both
Parties to file observations on the application. On 30 June 2015, both Parties submitted
their observations.

On 10 July 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2. The Tribunal found the
Application premature. In the Tribunal’s view:

The jurisdictional question specified in the Application has not been raised by either Party thus
far. In fact, the Respondent has not raised any objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to date,
neither based on the argument outlined in the Application nor on any other ground. Therefore,
the matter on which the Applicant seeks to file a written submission is not currently a matter
within the scope of the dispute.”

Accordingly, the Tribunal dismissed the EC’s application, without prejudice to any future
application.

The Parties’ First Round of Written Submissions

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, on 25 September 2015, the Claimant filed a
Memorial on the Merits (“MoM”). The pleading was accompanied by the witness
statements of Mr. José Alberto Cefia Lazaro, dated 18 September 2015 (“CWS-AC”),
Mr. Gerardo David G6émez-Sainz Garcia, dated 22 September 2015 (“CWS-DG”),
Mr. José Manuel Ramos Pérez-Polo, dated 16 September 2015 (“CWS-JMR”), and
Dr. Luis Crespo Rodriguez, dated 31 July 2015 (“CWS-LC”). The pleading was further
accompanied by the Brattle Group’s (“Brattle”) regulatory expert report prepared by Dr.
José Antonio Garcia and Mr. Carlos Lapuerta, dated 23 September 2015 (“BRR I’) and
Brattle’s quantum expert report prepared by Mr. Carlos Lapuerta, Mr. Richard Caldwell
and Dr. José Antonio Garcia, dated 23 September 2015 (“BQR I’).

By letter of 27 October 2015, the Respondent notified the Tribunal of its intention to raise
preliminary objections together with a request for bifurcation. On 3 December 2015, the
Respondent filed its Memorial of Preliminary Objections and Request for Bifurcation
(“MoPO”).

On 21 December 2015, the Claimant filed a request with the Tribunal to call upon the
Respondent to disclose and produce the award on jurisdiction in PV Investors v. Kingdom
of Spain Following an invitation by the Tribunal to comment, the Respondent filed its
comments on 30 December 2015. On 4 January 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order
No. 3, by which it dismissed the Claimant’s request for the Respondent to produce the
award on jurisdiction in PV Investors v. Kingdom of Spain.

On 12 January 2016, the Claimant filed its Observations on the Request for Bifurcation.

On 4 February 2016, the Claimant filed a copy of the award in Charanne v. Spain,* together
with a letter commenting on this award. By letter of 5 February 2016, the Respondent
replied to the Claimant’s letter.

On 12 February 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4. The Tribunal dismissed
the Respondent’s request for Bbifurcation and joined the Respondent’s jurisdictional
objections to the merits phase of the proceeding.

On 12 May 2016, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits (“CMoM”).
The pleading was accompanied by the witness statement of Mr. Carlos Montoya dated
11 May 2016 (“RWS-CMR”) and the expert report of Accuracy dated 12 May 2016
(“Accuracy I’).

The European Commission’s Second Application to Intervene

Meanwhile, on 15 December 2015, the EC filed a second application for leave to intervene
as a non-disputing party pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2).

By letter of 23 December 2015, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their observations
on the EC’s application.

On 2 February 2016, the Parties submitted their observations. The Respondent requested
that the Tribunal “[g]rant the Commission’s intervention as a non-disputing party in this
proceedings [sic]; allowing it to submit the statements it considers necessary (under
Tribunal’s discretion); to have access to all documents needed to comply with its mission
and to intervene in the Hearing”. The Claimant requested that the Tribunal “[deny] the
Commission’s Re-Application in full” or, in the alternative, that the EC could file the
amicus curiae brief on a set of conditions, such as a limit to the number of written
submissions as well as evidence submitted within the scope of the EC’s amicus curiae
briefs in other ECT cases. Additionally, the Claimant objected to the EC having access to
the file or participating in the hearing. The Claimant also urged the Tribunal to order the
EC to post a security for cost in an amount of no less than USD 300,000.00.

On 16 February 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 granting leave to the EC
to submit one written submission as a non-disputing party, limited to the question whether
the Tribunal should deny jurisdiction based on the fact that the dispute at hand concerns an
ECT claim against the Respondent by a legal entity incorporated in Luxembourg. The EC
were to bear its own costs for such intervention, and it was not granted access to the case
file.

On 11 November 2016, the EC filed an amicus curiae brief pursuant to ICSID Arbitration
Rule 37(2) (“EC’s First Amicus Curiae Brief”).

The Parties’ Second Round of Written Submissions

On 9 January 2017, the Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (“CMoJ”) and
its Reply on the Merits (“RoM”). The pleading was accompanied by the second witness
statements of Mr. José Alberto Cefia Lazaro, dated 27 December 2016 (“CWS-AC2”),

Kindelan dated 22 February 2017 (“Casanova Report”).

On 24 March 2017, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (“RjoJ”).

The Sale of the Claimants’ Investments and Postponement of the 2017 Hearing

On 14 November 2017, the President held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the
Parties by telephone conference. The Hearing was to be held the week of 18-22 December
2017.

As agreed in the pre-hearing organizational meeting, on 30 November 2017, each Party
filed a request for the Tribunal to admit new documents into the record in preparation for
the hearing.

On 4 December 2017, the Tribunal granted leave to the Parties to submit the documents
included in their respective requests of 27 November 2017, including a decision of the EC
on the procedure State Aid SA.40348 (“EC State Aid Decision”).*

On 5 December 2017, the Claimant advised that “a sale of Iberedlica Solar Olivenza, S.L.
and Ibereélica Solar Moron, S.L. is likely to happen on the third week of December.
Renergy S.ar.l. (the Claimant) is an indirect shareholder of these two companies as it owns
50% of Ibereolica Solar S.L., which in turn holds approximately 36% of shares in Olivenza
and 35% in Morén.” The Claimant added in its letter that regardless of any corporate
restructuring, the Claimant would reserve and keep its rights over the claims brought in
this arbitration. Through a letter on the same day, the Respondent objected to the
Claimant’s characterization of this transaction, arguing that such a disclosure two weeks
before the hearing had consequences with regard to the calculation of damages, as well as
aspects of substantive protections in the dispute. Therefore, the Respondent asked the
Tribunal to suspend the hearing.

On 6 December 2017, following both Parties’ letters of 5 December 2016, the Tribunal
invited the Parties to indicate whether they would be willing to agree on a three-day hearing
limited to jurisdiction and responsibility, with one on quantum to follow later, if necessary.

On 7 December 2017, the Respondent submitted a letter to the Tribunal, objecting to a

7 BQR-126.
State aid decision SA.40348 of 10 November 2017 (RL-0116).

hearing on responsibility because of the effects that a potential sale may have on both
responsibility and quantum issues. On the same day, the Claimant submitted a letter to the
Tribunal, proposing a postponement of the hearing for a maximum of 12 to 14 weeks.

On 7 December 2017, the Tribunal warned the Parties that, considering the Tribunal
members’ availability, postponing the hearing would mean a deferral up until the second
half of 2018 and invited the Parties to indicate their views about it.

The Respondent submitted a letter on 8 December 2017, claiming that its right of defense
requires that the hearing be suspended, regardless of whether that means postponing it until
the second half of 2018. On the same day, the Claimant submitted a letter to the Tribunal
maintaining that splitting the hearing would give rise to other procedural issues that might
require a repetition of the hearing and increase the costs and time. Therefore, the Claimant
also asked the Tribunal to postpone the hearing.

On 11 December 2017, the Tribunal communicated to the Parties that it had decided to
postpone the hearing.

The European Commission’s Third Application to Intervene

On 16 May 2018, the EC filed a communication proposing to update its EC’s First Amicus
Curiae Brief, in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union
(“CJEU”) of 6 March 2018 in Slovak Republic v. Achmea B.V., Case C-284/16 (“Achmea
Judgment”).?

On 31 May 2018, each Party filed its observations on the EC’s application pursuant to
ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2). The Claimant objected to the EC’s participation whereas the
Respondent agreed to it, adding that any such update would provide “specific expert
knowledge to the Tribunal on a basic matter which is within the scope of the present
proceeding.”

On 7 June 2018, the Tribunal granted the EC’s application and on 22 June 2018, the EC
filed its updated amicus curiae brief (“EC’s Second Amicus Curiae Brief”).

On 14 June 2018, the Parties and the Tribunal were informed that henceforth Mr. Francisco
Grob, ICSID Legal Counsel, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

On 11 July 2018, the Respondent submitted its responses to the Claimant’s objections to
produce certain documents regarding the sale of Claimant’s plants in Spain, which the
Tribunal decided on 2 August 2018.

On 16 July 2018, the Claimant filed its comments on the EC’s Second Amicus Curiae Brief
(“CC on EC’s Comments on Achmea Judgment”). On the same day, the Respondent
filed its own comments (“RC on EC’s Comments on Achmea Judgment”).

Hearing

On 17 July 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 concerning the organization
of the hearing, which was to take place from 26 to 29 November 2018.

On 22 October 2018, the Claimant requested leave to introduce two memoranda prepared
by their experts, Brattle, concerning Renergy’s “CSP assets transaction price and potential
conclusions with regard to damages valuation” and “the corporate restructuring of
Renergy’s wind assets valuation and potential conclusions with regard to damages
valuation”.

On 23 October 2018, the Claimant requested permission from the Tribunal to amend BQR
II in relation to some errors found in table 4 thereof.

As agreed by the Parties, on 25 October 2018, each submitted a request for the Tribunal to
admit new documents into the record in preparation for the hearing.

By a letter dated 30 October 2018, the Respondent addressed the Claimant’s request of 22
and 23 October. The Respondent agreed to let the Claimant’s correct the errors found in
table 4 of BQR II, but asked the Tribunal “[t]o reject Claimant's request to introduce the
Brattle ’s memoranda or alternatively if they are allowed to introduce them, to provide
Accuracy with exactly the same documents and information that have been provided to
Brattle to draft the memoranda and increases the time allocated for Accuracy’s
presentation and Respondent’s cross-examination of Brattle’s experts at the hearing in
order to properly assess Brattle ’s memoranda.”

On 31 October 2018, the Claimant responded the Respondent’s 30 October letter. By
another communication sent the same day, the Claimant stated that it had no comments
with regard to the inclusion of the new documents set out by the Respondent in its request
dated 25 October 2018.

On 5 November 2018, the Respondent submitted its observations on the Claimant’s 25
October request to include new documents into the record.

By a letter dated 9 November 2018, the Tribunal decided to permit the Claimant to make
the proposed corrections to BQR II as per the Claimant’s request of 23 October 2018 and
its communication of 31 October 2018. It also allowed the Claimant to file the two
memoranda prepared by Brattle and offered by the Claimant in its request of 22 October
2018. The Respondent was invited to file two expert memoranda in response thereto.
Furthermore, the Tribunal granted in part the Claimant’s request of 25 October 2018 for
the introduction of new documents and granted in its entirety the Respondent’s request of
25 October 2018.

A hearing on jurisdiction, responsibility and quantum was held in Madrid from 26-29

Post-hearing Procedures

On 19 December 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13, posing certain
questions to the Parties pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 19.

On 25 January 2019, the Respondent filed a request for leave to file the “Declaration of
the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, of 15 January 2015 on the
legal consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on Investment
Protection in the European Union” (“22 Member States Declaration’”)!° as an additional
legal authority.

Following the Tribunal’s order, on 1 February 2019, both Parties filed simultaneous post-
hearing briefs with answers to the questions posed by the Tribunal (“C-PHB” and “R-
PHB”, respectively).

On 4 February 2019, the Claimant filed observations on the Respondent’s request of
25 January 2019.

On 19 February 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to introduce into the record and to
comment on the 22 Member States Declaration, the “Declaration of the Representatives of
the Governments of the Member States on the Enforcement, of 16 January 2019 of the
Judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on Investment Protection in the European
Union” (“Five Member States Declaration’)! and the “Declaration of the Representative
of the Government of Hungary, of 16 January 2019 on the legal consequences of the
judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on investment protection in the European
Union”'? (collectively “EU Member States Declarations”).

On 4 March 2019, the Parties submitted their comments on the EU Member States
Declarations (“CC on Declarations of EU Members States” and “RC on Declarations
of EU Members States”, respectively).

On 8 April 2019, the Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on the
admissibility of a new legal authority, namely the Decision on Responsibility and on the
Principles of Quantum rendered in RREEF v. Spain.'?

On 15 April 2019, the Claimant filed its observations on the Respondent’s request, urging
the Tribunal to deny Spain’s application on the basis that the request: (i) is “an eleventh —
hour attempt to reopen the debates’; (ii) “goes against the principle of procedural economy
and efficiency that the Tribunal has at all times tried to protect’; and (iii) “fails to meet the
substantive requirements under Section 16(3) of Procedural Order No. 1”.

ll

76 On 23 April 2019 the Tribunal communicated to the Parties that the Respondent’s request
to include the above-mentioned new legal authority was granted. The Tribunal also noted
the Claimant’s assertion that three related additional decisions which were not in the record
had surfaced, namely Foresight/Greentech v. Spain,'* Cube v. Spain (Decision on
Jurisdiction, Liability and Partial Decision on Quantum)! and NextEra v. Spain (Decision
on Jurisdiction, Liability and Quantum Principles)'®; as such, it invited the Parties to file
those decisions into the record and submit their views in relation thereto.

77 Following exchanges between the Parties on issues of confidentiality and the lack of
consent from the Claimant on that decision, on 10 May 2019, the Tribunal decided to allow
the withdrawal of the NextEra v. Spain decision from the record.

78 On 26 November 2019, the Respondent filed another request for the Tribunal to decide on
the admissibility of a new legal authority, namely the Eskosol v. Italy decision.'”

79 On 2 December 2019, the Claimant filed its observations to the Respondent’s request of
26 November 2019 as well as a new request for the Tribunal to decide on the admissibility
of new evidence. More specifically, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal grant leave
to introduce into the record Royal Decree-Law 17/2019 of 22 November 2019 along with
certain statements released by Spanish authorities after the approval of this Decree, as well
as a number of new arbitral decisions on the Respondent’s regulatory framework for
renewable energy production.

80 Upon the Tribunal’s invitation, on 8 January 2020, the Respondent filed its response to the
Claimant’s observations and request of 2 December 2019, identifying additional arbitral
decisions on the same subject-matter that it requested to be admitted to the record.

81 On 23 January 2020, the Claimant filed its response to the Respondent’s last observations
as well as a request for the Tribunal to decide on the admissibility of a new document,

respective requests and inviting them to submit any comments they may have on those new
documents. The Claimant filed its comments on 14 February 2020 (“CC on ECT
Decisions”). After the Tribunal had granted an extension of the applicable deadline, the
Respondent filed its comments on 19 February 2020.

On 5 March 2020, the Respondent filed a new request for the Tribunal to decide on the
admissibility of a new document, namely the Final Award in PV Investors v. Spain.'? The
Claimant submitted its observation on the Respondent’s request on 9 March 2020,
following which the Tribunal decided on 12 March 2020 to grant the Respondent’s request.

On 13 March 2020, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), the EC filed a letter titled
“Legal Developments in case ARB/14/18” (“EC Submission on State Aid”), informing
the Tribunal of the EC State Aid Decision and of the EC’s views on the relevance thereof
to this arbitration.

On 19 March 2020, the Tribunal invited the EC to submit additional clarifications. The
Tribunal sought explanations regarding the timing of EC Submission on State Aid, in light
of the fact that the EC State Aid Decision was rendered on 10 November 2017, thus, more
than two years before the EC Submission on State Aid and the EC’s Second Amicus Curiae
Brief of 22 June 2018.

On 26 March 2020, the EC filed its responses to the Tribunal’s request for clarification,
stating that when it requested permission to supplement its brief on intra-EU objection in
April 2018, the EC had not also requested to file observations on the State aid objection.
Noting its oversight, the Commission added that it deemed it preferable to inform the
arbitral Tribunal of the legal consequences of the EC State Aid Decision, despite its belated
submission.

On 23 April 2020, following the Tribunal’s invitation of 8 April 2020, both Parties filed
their respective comments on the EC Submission on State Aid as well as on the treatment
of the State aid issue in BayWa v. Spain (“CC on BayWa” and “RC on BayWa”,
respectively).° According to the Claimant, the EC bypassed express procedural rules and
requested that the Tribunal strike the EC Submission on State Aid out of the case record.
The Respondent submitted that the EC Submission on State Aid would be of assistance to
both the Parties and the Tribunal on essential issues on the interface between the ECT and
the EU State aid legal framework, which are issues at stake in the present proceeding;
therefore, it requested that the Tribunal grant leave to admit the EC Submission on State
Aid into the record.

On 30 April 2020, the Clamant wrote to the Tribunal to “[complain] about some

misrepresentations that the Respondent made” in its submission of 23 April 2020.

On 4 May 2020, the Respondent replied that it was “surprised by this unsolicited
Claimant's letter that implies an unfair attempt of censorship” and asked the Tribunal to
dismiss Claimant’s request or, alternatively, to grant Spain leave to respond.

On 6 May 2020, the Tribunal decided to disregard the Claimant’s 30 April letter and it
reminded the Parties to refrain from making unsolicited submissions. The Tribunal
observed that the Claimant’s letter responded to the Respondent’s comments on the BayWa
v. Spain decision by referring to the arguments that the Claimant has made and developed
at length in this arbitration. The Tribunal did not call for this response, nor did the Claimant
ask for permission before sending it.

On 17 June 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14 requesting the Parties to
submit additional calculations from Brattle respectively Accuracy (jointly “Experts”). The
Tribunal requested that the Experts calculate the “actual”, the “but-for” and an “alternative
but-for” discounted cash flow from 1 January 2013 until the end of the lifetime of each
CSP plant and wind farm subject to this arbitration, based on the assumptions set out in the
Annex of that Order, as well as the Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”) at a project level
expressed both as pre-tax and post-tax numbers.

On 23 June 2020, the Respondent sought leave from the Tribunal to submit into the record
the Annulment Decision rendered in the Eiser v. Spain case.”! The Claimant responded on
29 June 2020 that it did not have any objections. The Respondent subsequently submitted
a copy of the decision into the record.

On 5 August 2020, the Parties submitted a joint financial model agreed upon by the Experts
in response to Procedural Order No. 14, together with a separate memorandum from each
Expert setting out joint and diverging views of the Experts.

On 8 September 2020, the Tribunal sent various questions to the Experts in relation to their
financial model and memoranda. In response to those questions, the Respondent filed a
memorandum by Accuracy on 21 September 2020, while the Claimant filed a
memorandum by Brattle the following day.

On 7 October 2020, the Claimant filed a further memorandum by Brattle (dated 6 October
2020) in response to the Tribunal’s questions of 8 September 2020.

On 8 October 2020, the Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to grant leave to
Accuracy to respond to Brattle’s latest memorandum. On the same day, the Claimant

submitted its comments to the Respondent’s request.

On 9 October 2020, the Respondent sought leave from the Tribunal to submit into the

Dissenting Opinion of Mr. David R. Haigh Q.C., issued in Cavalum v. Spain.”

On 19 October 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15, dismissing the
Respondent’s request of 8 October 2020, and inviting the Claimant to submit its comments
on the Respondent’s request of 9 October 2020. In addition, having considered the
submissions by the Experts in response to Procedural Order No. 14 and the Tribunal’s
questions of 8 September 2020, the Tribunal posed certain follow-up questions in relation
to the IRRs in the Expert’s joint financial model.

On 26 October 2020, the Claimant filed its observations on the Respondent’s request of
9 October 2020.

On 30 October 2020, the Tribunal decided to grant the Respondent’s request and admit into
the record the Cavalum v. Spain decision and dissenting opinion.

On 9 November 2020, the Parties filed a joint memorandum signed by the Experts and an
amended joint financial model elaborated by the Experts providing a corrected version of
the summary tables reporting the IRRs for the standard installation assigned to the Lubian
wind farm subject to this arbitration.

On 18 November 2020, the Tribunal sent a list of additional questions to the Parties. The
Tribunal requested that the Experts provide an alternative version of the joint financial
model that relied on a different production forecast for the wind farms subject to this
arbitration. The Experts were also asked to confirm certain effective tax rates.

On 18 December 2020, both Parties filed an alternative financial model and joint
memorandum prepared by the Experts based on the Tribunal’s instructions of 15 December
2020. On the same day, the Claimant filed a request for leave to include into the record a
version of the aforementioned joint memorandum that incorporated certain references by
Brattle to the 1989 Renewable Energy Plan and to financial models underlying the target
returns under the “Plan de Energias Renovables en Espaiia 2005-2010” (“PER 2005”).?>

On 23 December 2020, following the Tribunal’s instructions of 15 December 2020, the
Respondent filed its comments on the Claimant’s request of 18 December 2020.

On 6 January 2021, the Tribunal decided to dismiss the Claimant’s request of 18 December
2020, stating that the Claimant did not establish any exceptional circumstances within the
meaning of Section 16.3 of Procedural Order No. | to admit the additional references into
the record and that, in any event, the Claimant could have submitted those documents
together with BQR I.

On 14 April 2021, the Respondent submitted a new request for leave to submit into the

observation to the Respondent’s request the following day.

On 19 April 2021, the Tribunal decided on the Respondent’s request of 14 April 2021 by
granting leave for the Respondent to submit the two decisions into the record. At the same
time, in view of the Experts’ previous submissions, the Tribunal requested the Parties to
file an updated joint financial model by their Experts, with modified alternative but-for
scenarios. More specifically, the Tribunal requested that the Experts reduce the amount of
LNG use to 15,000 thermal MWh p.a. for each of the CSP plants subject to this arbitration,
effective from 15 October 2014, and cap, as of 21 June 2014, the post-tax IRRs at 7% for
the wind farms and at 8% for CSP plants subject to this arbitration.

On 21 May 2021, the Parties filed an updated joint financial model and a joint
memorandum, both elaborated and signed by the Experts.

On 27 May 2021, in view of certain disagreements by the Experts in the latest joint
memorandum, the Tribunal requested the Parties to have their Experts provide further
clarifications and an updated joint financial model.

On 2 June 2021, following the Tribunal’s decision, the Respondent submitted into the
record the FREIF v. Spain and Eurus v. Spain decisions.

On 4 June 2021, the Parties filed an updated joint memorandum prepared by the Experts
on the Tribunal’s understanding of the joint financial model updated as of 21 May 2021.

On 7 June 2021, noting disagreements of the Experts on the interpretation of certain results
in the Joint Memorandum, the Tribunal requested the Parties to submit an updated joint
financial model that reports the exact amounts of the relevant cash-flows.

Following the Tribunal’s request, on 14 June 2021, the Parties and the Experts filed an
updated joint financial model (“Joint Model”) prepared by the Experts to reflect the
damages figures rounded up or down to the next cent under each combination of toggles.

On 10 September 2021, the Respondent sought leave from the Tribunal to submit into the

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

This section provides a non-exhaustive summary only of those facts presented by the
Parties that the Tribunal deems helpful to explain its reasoning; however, the Tribunal
wishes to emphasize that it has carefully considered all facts relied upon by the Parties,
even to the extent that they are not specifically mentioned herein. Additional facts may be
set out in the framework of the legal discussion that follows in section V. of this Award.

The Claimant’s Investment
The Wind Farms

For the purpose of holding investments of Mr. Gerardo David Gémez-Sainz Garcia (“Mr.
G6émez”) in the renewable energy sector in Spain, the Spanish limited liability company
Inversiones Dagosa S.L.U. (“Dagosa”) was incorporated in 1997.27 In 1999, Mr. Gémez
and a partner decided to start promoting wind farms at the Spanish communities of
Hedroso-Aciberos (this wind farm is hereinafter referred to as “Hedroso”), Padornelo (this
wind farm is hereinafter referred to as “Padornelo”) and Lubidn (this wind farm is
hereinafter referred to as “Lubian”, which is divided into the two phases “Lubian 1” and
“Lubian 2”) (jointly “Wind Farms”). In this context, the Spanish limited liability
company Iberedélica S.L. (“Iberedlica”) was incorporated, which, in turn, incorporated on
22 March 2000 as its subsidiaries three Spanish limited liability companies, each of which
was to hold one of the Wind Farms: Iberedlica Hedroso-Aciberos S.A.U., Ibereélica
Padornelo S.A.U. and Iberedlica Lubin S.A.U. (jointly “Wind SPVs”).”8

Financing agreements with lending banks were concluded by Iberedlica Hedroso-Aciberos
S.A.U. and Iberedélica Padornelo S.A.U. on 17 July 2003 (both amended on 23 November
2005 to increase the loan) and by Iberedlica Lubian S.A.U. on 23 July 2004 (amended on
28 July 2006 for the same purpose).”?

In December 2003, Dagosa was purchased by Condeu Ltd. (“Condew”), a limited liability
company incorporated by Mr. Gémez under the laws of England and Wales.

On 6 November 2007, the Claimant acquired from Mr. Gémez 100% shareholding interest
in Condeu for a price of EUR 72 million.” At that time, Condeu was still holding 100%
shareholding interest in Dagosa, which in turn was holding a 50% stake in Iberedlica.*!
Accordingly, as a result of this transaction, the Claimant held a 50% indirect shareholding
interest in the Wind SPVs, mediated through Condeu, Dagosa and Iberedlica.

On 10 September 2009, the Claimant acquired from Condeu as a dividend in kind 100% of
interest in Dagosa, valued at approximately EUR 5.43 million. By means of this
transaction, Condeu was removed from the ownership chain between the Claimant and the
Wind SPVs. However, the Claimant’s indirect stake in the Wind SPVs remained
unchanged, i.e. at 50%.

On 20 December 2011, the share capital of Dagosa was increased by its sole shareholder,
the Claimant, by EUR 4.6 million, with an issue premium for the relevant shares of
EUR 5 million in total.

On 23 December 2015, Iberedlica Lubidn S.A.U. agreed with its lenders to restructure its
debt, inter alia by increasing the credit amount, the period of repayment and the interest
rate, by obliging Iberedlica Lubian S.A.U. to immediately allocate 50% of any “cash
excess” to the repayment of the debt, and by prohibiting any distribution of dividends to
shareholders of Iberedlica Lubién S.A.U. until certain financial rations were satisfied.”

On 21 December 2017, Dagosa (still fully owned by the Claimant) transferred to Condeu
(still fully owned by Mr. Gémez) its 50% equity interest in Iberedlica, including its shares
in the three Wind SPVs, for a price of EUR 9 million. This corresponds to the respective
audited accounts of Iberedlica. However, the Claimant retained all of its rights over any
ECT claims and actions.*?

The CSP Plants

On 21 November 2007, the Claimant purchased from Dagosa a 33.33% shareholding
interest in Iberedlica Solar S.L. (“Ibereélica Solar”), a limited liability company
incorporated under Spanish law, for an amount of EUR 1 million.**

On 1 July 2008, Ibereslica incorporated two Spanish limited liability companies as its
subsidiaries, namely Iberedlica Solar Moré6n S.L. and Iberedlica Solar Olivenza S.L. (“CSP
SPVs” and, together with the Wind SPVs, “SPVs”). The former was intended to own a
CSP plant at the Spanish community of Moron de la Frontera (this CSP plant is hereinafter
referred to as “Mor6n”), while the latter was intended to own a CSP plant at the Spanish

community of Olivenza (this CSP plant is hereinafter referred to as “Olivenza”; Olivenza
and Morén are hereinafter referred to collectively as the “CSP Plants”).*°

On 17 September 2008, the Claimant acquired a further 7.69% of shareholding interest in
Ibereélica Solar by means of a capital increase in the amount of EUR 7.7 million.*°

As a result of capital increases at the level of the CSP SPVs on 5 March 2009, 2 April 2009,
14 July 2010 and 19 May 2011, the Claimant held an indirect shareholding of 17% in each
of the CSP SPVs.*”

On 14 July 2010 and 19 May 2011, respectively, the CSP SPVs concluded contracts on
engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”), operation and maintenance
(“O&M”) and financing.**

On 26 May 2011, the Claimant purchased from Mr. Gémez and a third party (unrelated to
this arbitration) another 8.98% of shareholding interest in Iberedlica Solar for a price of
EUR 1.5 million. As a result, the Claimant held 50% of shareholding interest in Iberedlica
Solar from that date onwards.

On 28 July 2011, 21 December 2012 and 16 December 2013, Iberedlica Solar’s
shareholding interest in the CSP SPVs changed due to a partial sale of its shares to a third
party (unrelated to this arbitration) and two subsequent capital increases at the level of the
CSP SPVs. As a result, the Claimant eventually held an indirect shareholding interest in
the CSP SPVs of 17.92%.

On 7 April 2016 and 15 November 2016, respectively, the CSP SPVs agreed with the
lenders to a restructuring of their debts, involving inter alia a prolongation of the duration
of the financing agreement, a restructuring of fees, more stringent financial ratios and
restrictions on the distribution of dividends to shareholders.*

On 22 March 2018, Iberedlica Solar sold its shareholding interests in the CSP SPVs to a
third party (unrelated to this arbitration), but retained all of its rights over any ECT claims
and actions. The purchase price was EUR 11,108,812.20 for Ibereolica Solar Morén S.L.
and EUR 9,802,179.21 for Ibereolica Solar Olivenza S.L., plus a potential additional
deferred payment of EUR 2,421,055.24 for Ibereolica Solar Morén S.L. and EUR

Relevant State Agents

The Respondent’s Ministry in charge of energy matters (“Ministry of Energy”)*' is
responsible for the government’s policies on electricity and regulation of energy matters.
It is divided into Secretariats, one of which is the Secretariat of Energy presided over by
the State Secretary of Energy.”

Subordinated to the Secretariat of Energy is the Institute for Diversification and Saving of
Energy (known by the Spanish acronym “IDAE”). It contributes to the definition of the
energy policy, advises on technical and economic issues and prepares national renewable
energy plans. It also liaises with the industry. The President of IDAE is the State Secretary
for Energy.**

“Invest in Spain”, in turn, is a public agency dependent on the Ministry of Economy and
Competitiveness, which promotes foreign investments in Spain.**

Finally, the National Energy Commission (known by the Spanish acronym “CNE”),
subsequently integrated into the National Markets and Competition Commission
(“CNMC”), is tasked inter alia to monitor and control the adequate functioning of the
electrical sector, as well as to advise the government and issue non-binding reports.*>

Basic Features of the Spanish Legal System

The Spanish legal system is characterized by a hierarchical structure, with the Spanish
Constitution of 1978 forming the highest level. The next level comprises not only Acts of
Parliament (each a “Law”) but also Royal Decree Laws (each a “RDL”) adopted by the
Council of Ministers (an administrative body that comprises the President, the Prime
Minister and individual Ministers). RDLs are intended to respond to emergency situations
and have immediate effect but require subsequent parliamentary ratification. The next level
of hierarchy is formed by Royal Decrees (each a “RD”), which are executive acts
promulgated by Ministries in the exercise of regulatory powers provided for in Laws or
RDL. Such RDs, in turn, are implemented on the next hierarchical level by Ministerial
Orders (each a “MO”) promulgated by one or more Ministries and, on the lowest
hierarchical level, by Resolutions (issued by the relevant body within the competent
administration). Finally, Supreme Court case law complements the Spanish normative
regime.*°

140 Moreover, as a Member State of the European Union (“EU Member State”), the
Respondent is bound by EU regulations (which are directly applicable in EU Member
States), directives and decisions.”

141 In accordance with the principle of legal hierarchy enshrined in the Spanish Constitution,"
no normative act may be contrary to any normative act on a higher level of hierarchy. If a
court seeks to rest its judgment on a Law, but considers that such Law may be contrary to
the Constitution, it must put this question to the Spanish Constitutional Court, which may
declare the Law unconstitutional and, thus, null and void.*? By contrast, if a court considers
any normative act beneath the rank of a Law to infringe upon a normative act of a higher
hierarchical level, the court must refrain from applying the lower-level normative act,*°
which in such case is null and void de iure due to the principle of hierarchy.*!

D. The Regulatory Framework prior to the Disputed Measures
1. Law 54/1997

142 On 27 November 1997, the Respondent adopted Law 54/1997. This piece of legislation
marked the beginning of the (partial) liberalization of the Spanish energy market.**

143 In line with its stated objective of (among others) promoting renewable energy
production,°? Law 54/1997 set specific targets on the production of renewable energy in
Spain, in particular that 12% of energy consumption should be from renewables by 2010,
which reflected the targets previously set by the European Union.™ In order to create an
environment in which the set targets could be achieved, Law 54/1997 introduced two
separate regimes for the production of electric power in Spain: the so-called “Ordinary
Regime” and “Special Regime”. To qualify for either regime, facilities were required to
enrol in an administrative registry (known by the Spanish acronym “RAIPRE”).>

144 The Ordinary Regime applied mainly to electric power production facilities using non-
renewable energy sources. They were required to sell their electricity output in the
wholesale electricity market at the market price (so-called “Pool Price”).

145 By contrast, the Special Regime applied to qualifying electricity generators using
renewable energy sources such as wind power or CSP, provided that the installed capacity

electricity delivered into the grid was not limited to the Pool Price. Instead, “where
applicable, a premium shall be determined by the Government [...], in accordance with
the provisions of article 30.4” *" While said Article 30(4) Law 54/1997 provided that this
premium was “to be developed by implementing regulations”, it did specify that the

determination of premiums will take account of the voltage level of the delivery of energy to the
network, the effective contribution to the improvement of the environment, the primary energy
savings and energy efficiency, the production of economically justifiable useful heat and the
investment costs incurred, in order to achieve reasonable rates of profitability with reference to
the cost of the money on the capital markets.** (emphasis added)

  

  

RD 2818/1998

On 23 December 1998, the Respondent adopted RD 2818/1998, which specified the
premium payable to Special Regime producers and, as such, acted as “implementing
regulation” within the meaning of Article 30(4) Law 54/1997. This is the Royal Decree
under which the Wind Farms were constructed, commissioned and admitted to the Special
Regime.”

Broadly speaking, RD 2818/1998 classified renewable energy producers into various
groups, mainly based on the technologies used,” and specified the applicable premium that
the producers in the respective categories were entitled to receive on top of the Pool Price
for each kWh supplied to the grid.°! For some of the categories (including wind farms, but
not CSP plants), the respective producers were granted the alternative option of receiving
a fixed regulated tariff (“Regulated Tariff”), instead of receiving the Pool Price plus the
applicable premium.®? Both remuneration options, however, were only available for
producers with an installed capacity not exceeding 50 MW.

Premiums and tariffs were to be updated each year by the Ministry of Energy, taking into
account the variation in the average sales price for electricity.“ In addition, premiums were
to be revised every four years considering the evolution of electricity market price, the

installations’ demand coverage and the effect on the management of the Spanish Electricity
System (“SES”) as a whole.®>

In addition, RD 2818/1998 provided for a supplement or penalty, depending on the
circumstances, for reactive energy. This is a financial bonus or penalty applied to revenue
from the sale of energy for maintaining, or failing to maintain, certain power factors
required for the well-functioning of the SES. This supplement/penalty applied under
RD 2818/1998 and subsequent RDs irrespective of the selected remuneration scheme.

Finally, RD 2818/1998 expressly allowed CSP Plants to use fuel ("Back-up Fuel”) “to
maintain the temperature of their heat accumulator during periods where their electrical
generation is interrupted.”

The PER 2000

In accordance with Law 54/1997,%" the Respondent approved in December 1999 a “Plan
de Fomento de las Energias Renovables en Espafia 2000-2010” (“PER 2000”)®, which
was prepared by IDAE and set out the government’s policy for attaining the renewable
energy target of 12% by the year 2010.

The PER 2000 explained the methodology used as follows:

Taking as a baseline the proposed energy targets, the financing requirements have been
determined for each technology according to its profitability, defining a range of standard
projects for the calculation model.

These standard projects have been characterised by technical parameters relating to their size,
equivalent operating hours, unit costs, periods of implementation, lifespan, operating and
maintenance costs and sale prices per final unit of energy. Similarly, some financing
assumptions have been applied, as well as a series of measures or financial aid. (bold original)

RD 436/2004

On 12 March 2004, the Respondent enacted RD 436/2004, which repealed RD 281 8/19987!
and, as per its preamble, served to ensure that the renewable energy targets set by Law
54/1997 and the PER 2000 were achieved.”

While maintaining many aspects of the feed-in remuneration mechanism provided for by
RD 2818/1998, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to highlight the following two changes
regarding the remuneration parameters:

(i) Instead of obtaining the Regulated Tariff, renewable energy producers still had the
alternative option of selling their net output freely on the market and receiving a
subsidy on top of the Pool Price. However, the subsidy now consisted not only of a
premium, but also of an additional incentive for participating in the market.’

(ii) The Regulated Tariff, the premium, the incentive and the reactive energy
supplement/penalty were all expressed as fixed percentages of the reference
electricity tariff (known by the Spanish acronym “TMR”).”*

Moreover, Article 40(1) RD 436/2004 contemplated revisions to the Regulated Tariff,
premiums and incentives every four years starting from 2006.

In addition, Article 40(3) RD 436/2004, the meaning of which is heavily disputed between
the Parties, provided as follows:

 

 
  

premiums, incentives and supplements resulting from any of the revisions provided
section shall apply solely to the facilities that commence operations subsequent to the
date of the entry into force referred to in the section [apartado] above and shall not be effective
retroactively on any previous tariffs and premiums.”5

 

Also, RD 436/2004 provided as follows regarding the use of Back-up Fuel by CSP plants:

Tribunal considers that nothing turns on the different translations].

In these installations, equipment may be used which uses a fuel to maintain the temperature of
the hot transmission fluid to compensate the lack of solar irradiation which may affect the
expected delivery of energy. Electricity production from the aforementioned fuel, annually, must
be less than 12% of total electricity production if the facility sells its energy [under the Regulated
Tariff]. The aforementioned percentage may reach 15% if the facility sells its energy [under the
Pool Price plus Premium and Incentive option].”°

 

159 Finally, installations subject to RD 2818/1998 that had already obtained final registration
in the RAIPRE were granted a transitional period during which they could choose between
remaining subject to RD 2818/1998 for a limited time or switching to RD 436/2004
immediately.”

160 While RD 436/2004 was in force, the Wind Farms were granted final commissioning
certificates, chose the option to sell their energy on the market in exchange for the Pool
Price plus premium and incentive, obtained final registration in RAIPRE and started
operating (with the exception of Lubidn 2, which obtained final registration and started
operating only after RD 661/2007 had entered into force).’*

5. The PER 2005
161 On 26 August 2005, the Respondent approved the PER 2005.

162 The PER 2005 observed that only 28.4% of the renewable energy target set for 2010 had
been achieved thus far. While noting that at the end of 2004, wind energy had already
reached 91% of the capacity set for 2010,”? the PER 2005 found that solar energy had been
“developing notably below the rhythm necessary to achieve the final objectives.”*°
However, the PER 2005 concluded that, in order to achieve the targets for 2010, no change
was required to the remuneration regime as regards CSP*! and wind energy*. Instead, one
of the changes proposed was a more ambitious target for wind energy for 2010.*°

163 Calculations on the costs of achieving the set targets were, as in the PER 2000, predicated
upon “fechnical-economic parameters” for “standard projects”,** including an IRR
estimated “around 7% on equity (before any financing) and after tax”.*° At the same time,
the plan estimated that around 77% of the investment in renewables would likely be debt-

December 2005 Supreme Court Judgment

On 15 December 2005, the Spanish Supreme Court decided on an appeal brought by an
association of renewable energy producers against RD 436/2004.*’ The association
essentially argued that RD 436/2004 brought about adverse changes (as compared to
RD 2818/1998) that affected existing installations. The Spanish Supreme Court dismissed
the appeal and noted in particular that

[gliven the normative rank of this Royal Decree [RD 2818/1998], nothing prevents another norm
of the same hierarchical rank from modifying it.$*

Moreover, the Spanish Supreme Court found that:

      

is no legal obstacle that exists to prevent the Government, in the exercise of the regulatory
powers and of the broad entitlements it has in a strongly regulated issue such as electricity, from
modifying a specific system of remuneration remaining within the framework established by
[Law 54/1997].8°

 

RDL 7/2006

On 23 June 2006, the Respondent passed RDL 7/2006. Among others, RDL 7/2006
provided that until a new remuneration regime was put in place, future revisions of the
TMR would not affect the remuneration for renewable energy technologies including CSP
and wind power.” In other words, the remuneration level was temporarily frozen. The
background to this change was that the TMR-linkage introduced by RD 436/2004 had
resulted in very significant increases of the remuneration paid by the Respondent to
renewable energy producers.”!

October 2006 Supreme Court Judgment

On 25 October 2006, the Spanish Supreme Court issued a judgment on a challenge against
a RD that is not at issue in this arbitration. According to the plaintiff in that case, that RD
changed the system for calculating premiums under RD 436/2004. The Supreme Court
dismissed the appeal and found as follows:

86 For wind and CSP technologies, see PER 2005, Section 4.5 [as per the Respondent's translation on p. 126, 135 of
the PDF; not included in the Claimant's translation].

87 As a matter of course, the Tribunal assumes that this decision, as well as all other decisions of the Spanish Supreme
Court referred to in this Award, were made public on or shortly after the date of the decision.

Until it is replaced by another, [Article 30 of Law 54/1997] allows the respective companies to

Companies that freely decide to enter a market such as electricity generation under the special
regime, knowing that is largely dependent on the setting of economic incentives by public
authorities, are or should be aware that they may be modified within legal guidelines, by those
same authorities. One of the ‘reg s’ to which they submit and which they must take
into account, is precisely the variation of parameters for premiums or incentives, something
which the [Law 54/1997] limits, as previously discussed, but does not preclude.22 (emphasis
added)

 

   

    

9. RD 661/2007 and March 2007 Supreme Court Judgment

168 — The initial draft of what would become RD 661/2007 was released on 28 November 2006.
The press release accompanying the draft stated:

As far as profitability is concerned, the new regulation guarantees a return of 7% for wind [...]
installations opting for the regulated tariff, and a return of between 5% and 9% if they participate
in the electric energy generation market.

In the case of technologies requiring a boost because of their limited development, such as [...]
solar thermal, profitability is increased to 8% for the regulated tariff option and between 7 and
11% when participating in the market.”

169 On 14 February 2007, the CNE issued a report on this draft. It noted that feed-in
remuneration is an essential regulatory instrument to reach the renewable energy targets
set by the government. It also pointed out the importance of legal stability for investors and
recommended that any future revisions to the remunerative regime follow the example of
Article 40(3) RD 436/2004 and not affect existing installations.** At the same time, the
CNE noted:

As shown both in the scientific doctrine case law [...] the principles of legal certainty and
protection of legitimate expectations cannot be [...] used as instruments to petrify current Law
at any moment. [...] it does not mean that legislation nt or immune to reform. [...] Thus
the principles only require that regulatory innovation-especially if sudden, unpredictable or
unexpected-be carried out with certain guarantees and caution (sufficient transition periods for
adaption and, where applicable, compensatory measures) that cushion, moderate and minimise
as s possible the defrauding of expectations generated by the previous regulations.”>

    

  

170 On 20 March 2007, the Spanish Supreme Court issued a judgment concerning an
amendment to RD 436/2004 with regard to the methodology for updating premiums.®° The
plaintiff claimed, among others, that the amendment reduced by 22.6% the premium value

in force the previous year, undermining legitimate expectations in view of the fact that they
had invested in reliance of legal conditions remaining stable. The Supreme Court rejected
the appeal, quoting extensively from its 25 October 2006 judgment.

171. On 21 March 2007, the Ministry of Energy prepared a report on the proposed new
regulation. According to the report, which the Claimant argues was an internal document
only released “now”?’:

The regulated tariff has been calculated in order to ensure a return of between 7% and 8%
depending on the technology. Bonuses have been calculated following the same criteria as in
Royal Decree 436/2004, that is, the bonus is calculated as the difference between the regulated
tariff and the average market price set for these technologies. [...]

3.2.2. Solar Thermoelectic Sector

 

]

The regulated tariff value proposed provides an 8 % return (IRR in local currency, with own
capital, after tax and after 25 years).

For the market option, a bonus is proposed that ensures an IRR per project of 9.5 % for the
standard case after 25 years, with a 7.6 % minimum and 11% maximum in the limits of the
band.** (bold original, underline added)

172. On 29 March 2007, the Respondent’s Chief State Attorney issued a report on the draft of
RD 661/2007, noting in inter alia that:

To argue for a subjective right to the premium in the future on the same terms currently
established by RD 436/2002 [sic] would be to claim a subjective right to an incentive based
merely on the fact that it had been offered in previous years, irrespective of any change to the
legal framework. The only thing that the Government is under obligation to do is to establish a
reasonable return.””

 

173, On 25 May 2007, the Respondent enacted RD 661/2007, which replaced RD 436/2004
(subject to an optional transitory period, see {178 infra). RD 661/2007 is the RD under
which the CSP Plants were constructed, commissioned and started operating.!°°

174 The preamble of RD 661/2007 states as follows:

(v)

Instead of receiving a Regulated Tariff, producers could still sell the energy on the
market for the Pool Price and receive from the Respondent a premium, but no longer
an additional incentive for participating in the free market (“Pool Price Plus
Premium” option). Both the Regulated Tariff and the premium were set in
numerical terms (euros per kWh), i.e. disassociated from the TMR.'?

 

In relation to the Pool Price Plus Premium option, RD 661/2007 introduced cap and
floor limits to the remuneration payable per KWh.!°

After a certain number of years of operation, renewable energy producers were set
to receive lower levels of Regulated Tariff or premium, respectively, until the end
of their lifetime.!*

RD 661/2007 maintained the reactive energy supplement/penalty'”

and the right to

The values of the Regulated Tariff, premiums, cap and floor limits were to be
updated on a quarterly basis as a function of certain fuel price indices and the
Spanish consumer price index (“CPI”) for the same period.!©”

176 In addition, Article 44(3) RD 661/2007, the meaning of which is heavily disputed between
the Parties, provided as follows:

During 2010, in view of the results of the monitoring reports on the degree of compliance with
the [PER 2005], and of the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy in Spain (E4), together with
such new targets as may be included in the subsequent Renewable Energies Plan for the period
2011-2020, there will be a revision of the tariffs, premiums, supplements and lower and upper
limits defined in this Royal Decree, considering the costs associated with each of these
technologies, the degree of participation of the Special Regime in covering the demand and its
impact upon the technical and economic management of the system, always guaranteeing
reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in the capital markets. Thereafter,
every four years, a new revision shall be performed, maintaining the same criteria as previously.

under RD 436/2004.!

178 Finally, RD 661/2007 included a transitional provision which granted renewable energy
facilities commissioned before 1 January 2008 the possibility to (1) switch to the
remuneration regime of RD 661/2007 as of the date of its entry into force; or (2) apply the

179 On 25 May 2007, i.e. the day on which RD 661/2007 was enacted, the Respondent’s
government issued a press release which stated, inter alia:

The Government assigns priority to profitability and stability in the new Royal Decree on
renewable energy and cogeneration.

Ll

The purpose of this Royal Decree is to improve the remuneration of those less mature
technologies, such as [...] thermosolar, so as to be able to meet the objectives of the [PER 2005]

[ol

[...] The government’s commitment to [renewable] energy technologies has been the reason
why in the new regulation stability in time is sought allowing business owners to plan in the
medium and long term, as well as a sufficient and reasonable return which, like the stability,
makes the investment and engagement in this activity attractive. [...]

 

 

In 2010 the tariffs and premiums established in the proposal will be reviewed in the light of the
aims established in the [PER 2005] and the Energy Saving and Efficiency Strategy [...], and in
accordance with the new targets to be included in the next Renewable Energies Plan for the
2011-2020 period.

Any revisions of tariffs to be carried out in the future shall not affect the facilities already in
operation. This guarantee provides legal certainty for the producer, providing stability for the
sector and promoting its development.

The new regulation guarantees an average return of 7% for wind [...] installations opting to cede
their production to distributors, and a return of between 5% and 9% if they participate in the
electricity market.

For other technologies which require a boost due to their limited development, as with [...]
thermoelectric solar power, the profitability increases to 8% with the transfer of production to
distributors and between 7% and 11% if they participate in the market.

October 2007 Supreme Court Judgment

On 9 October 2007, the Spanish Supreme Court issued a decision on an amendment to
RD 436/2004 by a subsequent RD. Drawing upon its October 2006 and March 2007
judgments, and following the approach taken in those earlier judgments, the court held that
renewable energy producers do not have an intangible right but merely an expectation to
be paid the premium.!!*

RDL 6/2009

RDL 6/2009 of 30 April 2009 adopted new measures for the energy sector. Its preamble
reads, in relevant part, as follows:

detrimental to the security and capacity of financing the investments that are necessary to supply
electricity at the levels of quality and security demanded by the Spanish people.!!

RDL 6/2009 introduced the so-called “Remuneration Pre-Allocation Register” to control
and eventually limit the growth of renewable energy capacity in Spain.'!® In order to be
entitled to the economic regime established in RD 661/2007, facilities were required to get
registered in the Remuneration Pre-Allocation Register and, within 36 months of the
notification of such registration, to become registered in the RAIPRE and to start selling
energy.!'7 Registration in the Remuneration Pre-Allocation Register was only effected if
the facility concerned met a number of requirements.'!* Also, registration was only
possible as long as the target capacity for the technology in question had not yet been
exceeded based on facilities already registered in the Remuneration Pre-Allocation

Register.'!? The CSP Plants were registered in the Remuneration Pre-Allocation Register
on 11 December 2009,!2°

Moreover, RDL 6/2009 provided for a transitional regime in relation to facilities that met
the requirements for registration in the Remuneration Pre-Allocation Register already at
the time of entry into force of RDL 6/2009. If such facilities applied to be registered in the
Remuneration Pre-Allocation Register within 30 days of entry into force of RDL 6/2009,
they would be registered irrespective of whether the relevant target capacity had already
been exceeded.'*! However, if the relevant capacity target was exceeded, the Respondent
was given the power to impose annual restrictions on the entry into operation of pre-
registered installations if the economic or technical sustainability of the SES so required.!7?
This power was exercised through the Council of Minister’s Resolution of 13 November
2009, referred to in {184 infra.

Council of Ministers Resolution of 13 November 2009

On 13 November 2009, the Council of Ministers issued a resolution concerning renewable
energy facilities subject to RDL 6/2009. In view of the applications to the Remuneration
Pre-Allocation Register exceeding the previously set capacities for CSP plants and wind,
the Council of Ministers decided to accept additional capacity based on two technical
reports, which concluded that this was technically and economically feasible, although new
capacity should be limited to certain amounts given the difficulties involved in balancing
generation and demand.!*> However, in order not to compromise the technical and
economic security of the electrical system, the entry into operation of CSP plants and wind
farms was staggered.'*4 That said, according to the resolution, overall benefits of additional
renewable installations “greatly exceed the costs and justify the support for renewable
energy of the regulatory framework”!

December 2009 Supreme Court Judgments

On 3 December 2009, the Spanish Supreme Court issued a decision on a challenge against
RD 661/2007. Among others, the plaintiffs in that case contended that RD 661/2007
breached their legitimate expectations under Spanish law by disregarding the prohibition
against retroactivity set out in Article 40(3) RD 436/2004. The Supreme Court dismissed
the complaint and held that such “setting in stone or freezing of the remuneration system”
did not follow from Law 54/1997, which affords the Government “a degree of discretion

to determine the energy yields offered”.'?® In dismissing the claim, the Supreme Court
quoted from, and relied upon the approach taken by, its December 2005 judgment.

186 On 9 December 2009, the Supreme Court issued another decision on a challenge against
essentially the same amendment at issue in its October 2007 judgment. The Supreme Court
dismissed the challenge and noted:

[...] [the plaintiff] does not pay enough attention to the case law of this Chamber referred to with
regard to the principles of legitimate expectation and non-retroactivity applied to the successive
incentives’ regimes for electricity generation. This involves the considerations set out in our
decision dated October 25, 2006 and repeated in that issued on March 20, 2007, inter alia, about
the legal situation of the owners of electrical energy production installations under a special
scheme to whom it is not possible to acknowledge for the future an ‘unmodifiable right’ to the
maintenance unchanged of the remuneration framework approved by the holder of the regulatory
authority provided that the stipulations of the Law on the Electricity Sector are respected in
terms of the reasonable return on investments.'?”

14. The 2010 Agreements with the Wind and CSP Sectors and RD 1614/2010

187 From late April to early July 2010, officials from the Ministry of Energy discussed various
aspects of a proposed regulation with representatives of trade associations from the
renewable energy sector, including the wind energy association Asociacién Empresarial
Eolica (“AEE”) and Protermosolar, the latter representing the thermosolar industry. In
particular, those discussions related to the limitation of hours subject to feed-in
remuneration, premium values, transitional periods and the scope of future revisions.'?

188 On 2 July 2010, the Secretary of Energy sent by email to AEE the “Jatest version” of a
document entitled “Agreement with the Wind Sector” (“2010 Wind Agreement”), which
read as follows:

The [Ministry of Energy] has reached an agreement with the wind sector whereby it undertakes
to promote the following actions:

1. Temporary and extraordinary 35% reduction of the reference premium currently in force for
wind installations subjected to Royal Decree 661/2007, applicable from the entry into force of
the new Royal Decree and until 12/31/2012, notwithstanding the annual updates of the reference
premium in accordance with Royal Decree 661/2007. The regime established in First
Transitional Provision remain unchanged until 12/31/2012 and thereafter shall be subject to the
provisions of Royal Decree 661/2007, with annual updates.

 

 

2. Amendment of Art. 44.3 of Royal Decree 661/2007 stating that future revisions of the
premiums should not affect existing facilities, in precisely the same manner as currently
established for regulated tariffs and upper and lower limits, nor those installations, upon
approval of the revision, that were already registered into the Remuneration Pre-allocation
Register established by Royal Decree-Law 6/2009, of April 30.

3. For those years in which the average production values of the sector as a whole exceed the
provisions of PER2005-2010 (2,350 hrs), the hours of each plant exceeding 2,589 hrs (2,345
+10%) shall be remunerated at the pool price.

 

LJ

 

7. In order to maintain sustained growth in the industry and meet the 2020 targets for wind
energy, in determining the new remuneration framework applicable from 2013, the Government
will ensure reasonable rates of return benchmarked against the cost of money in the capital
market.

The legislative text resulting from this agreement shall be disclosed to the industry prior to the
processing thereof.!°

189 Likewise on 2 July 2010, Protermosolar sent by email to the Director General for Energy
Policy and Mining the “final version” of a document entitled “Agreement with the
Thermosolar Sector” (“2010 CSP Agreement” and, together with the 2010 Wind
Agreement, the “2010 Agreements”), which reads as follows:

The [Ministry of Energy] has reached an agreement with the thermosolar sector whereby they
undertake to promote the following actions:

1. Temporary and exceptional suppression of the market + premium option for one year for all
of the plants that are listed in the pre-registry, as of the entry into force of the Royal Decree or,
for those plants that shall enter into operation at a later date, during their first year of operation.

LJ

 

2. Solid commitment to delay the entry into operation of several of the listed plants, as per the
attached list.

3. Amendment of Article 44.3 of Royal Decree 661/2007, establishing that the future revisions
of premiums shall not affect existing facilities, in exactly the same way as the provisions
currently in place for regulated tariffs, and the upper and lower limits, nor those that at the time
of approving the review would be already listed in the Remuneration Pre-allocation Registry,
created by Royal Decree-Law 6/2009, of April 30, nor those that were definitively registered at
the Register of Production Facilities under the Special Regime (REPE as per its acronym in
Spanish) before May 6, 2009.

 

4. The number of equivalent operational hours at nominal, annual capacity, with a right to the
remuneration currently foreseen in Royal Decree 661/2007, during the operation of the facility,
shall under no circumstances be lower than: [...]

This number of hours shall not [be] subject to future revision for facilities listed at the
Remuneration Pre-allocation Registry or within the Register of Production Facilities under the
Special Regime before May 6. Operating hours that exceed the aforesaid limits shall be
remunerated at market price.

5. The terms of this Agreement, as far as legally relevant, shall be reflected in the resolutions
pertaining to each facility.

Ll

The legal instrument embodying this agreement shall be shared with the industry before the
approval process thereof is commenced.”"*

By return email of 2 July 2010, the Director General for Energy Policy and Mining replied
that “I have already seen it with the Secretary of State and it has our ok”.'*!

On 2 July 2010 the Respondent issued a press release announcing that “agreements” had
been found between the Ministry of Energy and the wind and thermosolar sectors, and
summarizing the main contents of the 2010 Agreements.'** Similar statements were
published on 2 July 2010 by Protermosolar and on 9 July 2010 by AEE.'*

On 15 July 2010, a first draft of what became RD 1614/2010 was disclosed to AEE and
Protermosolar.'*4 Both AEE and Protermosolar suggested specific changes to this draft by

communications sent on 20 and 21 July, respectively.'*°

193. A new draft followed on 30 July 2010, which was circulated for observations along with a

first explanatory report of the same date.'*°

194 On30 August 2010, AEE filed formal observations on this new draft before the CNE. Inter

alia, they stated:

The proposed modification of the remuneration regime of the reactive energy, if approved,
would have a level of retroactivity such that, according to the Jurisprudence of the Constitutional
Court, it may be considered of a ‘minimum degree’ as it only has an impact on the economic
effects that in a future would be produced although the basic situation or relation has arisen in
accordance with the previous one. It is true that the Supreme Court has declared, in relation to
this type of retroactive modification, that it is not an ‘unchangeable right’ that the economic
regime remains unaltered [...] thus recognizing a relatively broad margin to the ‘ius variandi’ of
the Administration in a regulated sector involving general interests. Meanwhile, [...] the
jurisprudence has established limits [...] with regard to the retroactive modification of this
remuneration framework, in particular ‘that the requirements of the Law on the Electrical Sector
are observed with regard to the reasonable return of investments’ [...]

 

 

AEE maintains in view of the above that any revision of the remuneration regime established in
Royal Decree 661/2007 must, necessarily guarantee the reasonable return of the investments and

131 ©0251. On 8 July, the Director General for Energy Policy and Mining sent to Protermosolar another document
identical to the one sent to the 2010 CSP Agreement, but this time with the Ministry of Energy’s logo on top of the

document, see C-0252.

moreover meet the criteria established in this Royal Decree (which have not been modified) and
to those higher principles of legal certainty and proportionality.'*”

195 On4 November 2010, the Ministry of Energy issued a regulatory impact report on the draft
of RD 1614/2010. It stated, in relevant part:

[The fact that installed power objectives for CSP and wind technologies as set out in the PER
2005 have been reached or exceeded] has also caused problems that need to be addressed before
they pose an irreversible threat to the economic and technical sustainability of the system. [...]

This Royal Decree provides a series of austerity measures to contribute to transferring to society
the gain from the proper evolution of these technologies in terms of competitiveness in relative
costs, reducing the deficit of the power system, while safeguarding the legal security of
investments and the principle of reasonable profitability. [...]

 

The remuneration values of Royal Decree 661/2007 were calculated in order to obtain
reasonable profitability rates [...]

Subsequently, during actual system operation, it was shown that [...] the remuneration obtained
exceeds that which is considered reasonable.

[...] as compensation for the reduction in remuneration for the first year [related to CSP
facilities], the wording of Article 44 of Royal Decree 661/2007 is amended, thereby
guaranteeing the installations in operation, and those pre-allocated, that the value of the
regulated and maximum tariffs, as well as the value of the bonus, will stay the same over time.

[...] as compensation for the reduction in remuneration for the given period [related to wind
farms], the wording of Article 44 of Royal Decree 661/2007 is amended, thereby guaranteeing
the installations in operation, and those pre-allocated, that the value of the regulated and
maximum tariffs, as well as the value of the bonus, will stay the same over time.'**

196 On 3 December 2010, the Respondent’s Council of Ministers announced the approval of
RD 1614/2010 through a press release that reads as follows in relevant part:

“The new regulations, which were agreed with both sectors last July, have the main objectives
of obtaining savings to benefit consumers and to make the objectives of promotion of renewable
energies compatible with those of limiting electricity production costs to guarantee the
sustainability of the electricity system.

   
 

The regulation also involves reinforcement of the visibility and stability of the regulation of
these technologies in the future, and guarantees the present premiums and tariffs of Royal Decree
661/2007 as of 2013 for facilities in operation and for those included on the pre-register.'°°

 

 

197. The Respondent subsequently promulgated RD 1614/2010 on 8 December 2010.
According to its Preamble,

'57 AAE, Observations before the CNE of 30 August 2010 (R-0166), p. 6f. of the PDF (footnotes omitted).

the support system [...] must be adapted, safeguarding the legal security of the investments and
the principle of reasonable return [...].!

RD 1614/2010 introduced a limit to the hours of annual operation for which CSP plants
and wind farms could obtain remuneration under the Special Regime.'*! It was provided
that such limit “shall not be revisable during their operational life” for all facilities that
were registered in RAIPRE, or were pre-registered in the Remuneration Pre-allocation
Register and managed to obtain RAIPRE registration within 36 months of their pre-
registration.'4?

In addition, the Regulated Tariff was made compulsory for CSP plants during their first
year of operation (or, for CSP plants already in operation, the first year after entry into
force of RD 1614/2010), ie. CSP plants could not opt for the Pool Price Plus Premium
option for that year.'#3

Moreover, all wind farms that had opted, under the First Transitory Provision of RD
661/2007, to remain under the Pool Price regime of RD 436/2004 (as did the Wind
Farms)'+, would be subject to the following remuneration regime as from | January 2013:
In principle, the Special Regime tariffs and premiums under RD 661/2007 would apply,
but instead of the higher values for 2013 that would otherwise have applied, the
remuneration would be based on the values determined for 2010.45 Those values would
be updated according to the coefficients that would have been applicable to them under
Article 44(1) RD 661/2007.'4°

Furthermore, Articles 4 and 5(3) RD 1614/2010 provided as follows:

 
 

For thermosolar technology facilities under [RD 661/2007], the revisions of tariffs, premiums
and lower and upper limits, to which Article 44.3 of said Royal Decree refers, shall not affect
those facilities finally registered in [RAIPRE] as of May, 7 2009, nor to those facilities pre-
registered on the remuneration pre-allocation Register [...] and that complied with the obligation
[to obtain final RAIPRE registration within 36 months of notification of the pre-registration].”"*7

 

 

 

Without prejudice to that set forth in this royal decree, for wind power technology faciliti
governed under [RD 661/2007], the reviews of the tariffs, bonuses and lower and upper limits
referred to in Article 44.3 of the aforementioned royal decree will not affect the facilities finally
registered in [RAIPRE] as of May 7, 2009, or those which had been registered in the

Waiver Letters and Waiver Acceptance Resolutions

On 21 October 2010, i.e. still before RD 1614/2010 was adopted, the secretary to the
Director General for Energy Policy and Mining sent an email to Protermosolar as follows:

As indicated by Mr. Antonio Hernandez, General Director for Energy Policy and Mining, I
hereby attach the waiver acceptance resolution forms and notice of remuneration conditions to
be passed, for each one of the facilities, on request of their owners."

Attached to said email were draft templates for letters to be sent by the Ministry of Energy
to owners of CSP plants once the owners had sent letters to the Ministry of Energy waiving
their right to enter into operation before a certain date (“Waiver Letters”).

Further exchanges and a meeting between the Ministry of Energy and Protermosolar on the
text of the two documents followed.'*° On 23 November 2010, Protermosolar circulated
amongst its members

the text that we have agreed with the Ministry in relation to the fulfilment of the undertaking by
each plant to notify of the new start date for delivery with premium or equivalent premium
rights, as was agreed on July 2 and was kept by the Ministry in the text sent to the Council of
State.!5!

In late November and early December 2010, the Ministry of Energy sent to all CSP
producers the respective (customized) Waiver Letters to be signed by them, and informed
Protermosolar that RD 1614/2010 would not be approved before all CSP producers had
sent the signed Waiver Letters to the Ministry.'** The CSP SPVs sent their Waiver Letters
on 30 November.'>? On 28 December 2010, the Ministry of Energy sent resolutions
(“Waiver Acceptance Resolutions”) to the CSP SPVs, accepting their waivers and stating,
in addition, as follows:

Communicates that, at present, under the provisions of paragraph | of the fifth transitional
provision of Royal Decree-Law 6/2009, of April 30, the remuneration applicable to the facility
is made up of the tariffs, premiums, upper and lower limits and supplements established by

206 In this arbitration, the legal regime as described in this section D. was labelled “Regulatory
Framework No. I” by the Claimant, and is referred to hereinafter as “RF1”.

E. The Disputed Measures
1. Regional Act 1/2012!°5

207 On 28 February 2012, the Respondent’s autonomous community Castile and Leon adopted
Regional Act 1/2012 (“Regional Act 1/2012”), entering into force on 1 March 2012.!°°

208 This legislation introduced a measure referred to as a “tax on the environmental effects
caused by [...] wind farms” (“TEE”).'°’ The “taxable event” is the “generation of visual
and environmental impacts by wind farms”.'** The number of turbines existing at the
relevant wind park forms the “taxable base”'*? and the amount payable is to be calculated
for each turbine separately based on its power.'® The operator and, if not identical, the
owner of the relevant installation are jointly liable for payment of the TEE.'°! The revenue
from the TEE will be used for the “financing of the region’s expenditure programmes on
industrial energy efficiency” |

2. Regional Act 9/2012

209 On 21 December 2012, Castile and Le6én passed Regional Act 9/2012 (“Regional Act
9/2012”), which created a regional fund to finance a regional surcharge to the electricity
tolls of Law 54/1997,'® and provided that the revenue collected through the TEE was
allocated to the said fund.'*

3. Law 15/2012

210 On 27 December 2012, the Respondent adopted Law 15/2012, which introduced two
notable changes to the regulatory framework.

211 First, Law 15/2012 restricted the use of Back-up Fuel as follows:

'55 Later repealed and replaced with a restated text by Regional Law Decree 1/2013, see MoM, 652.

163 Said surcharge was introduced, on a national level, by RDL 20/2012 (C-0395/R-0092), Article 38, which modified
Law 54/1997 (C-0060/R-0003), Article 17(4).

The electric energy attributable to the use of fuel in a generation facility that uses one of the non-
consumable renewable energies as its primary energy shall not be object of the feed-in
remuneration regime [...].

 

For these purposes, by order of the [Ministry of Energy], the methodology for the calculation of
the electric power that can be attributed to the fuels used shall be published.!°*

212 Until MO IET/1882/2014 set out the methodology referenced in the above quote (see
section 11. infra), the Respondent continued paying feed-in remuneration for energy
produced through Back-up Fuel as per the previous regulation, subject however to later
settlement if overpayments had occurred.'©°

213 Secondly, Law 15/2012 introduced a 7% “tax on the value of electric power generation"

(known by the Spanish acronym “TWPEE”), which applied to both conventional and

imbalance and environmental concerns.'® Moreover, Law 15/2012 provides that an
amount equal the estimated TVPEE revenue shall be allocated to finance the costs of the

SES.

4, RDL 2/2013

214 On 1 February 2013, RDL 2/2013 was promulgated, effective as of 1 January 2013. It
introduced two notable changes to the regulatory framework.

215 First, it effectively abolished the Pool Price Plus Premium option!” by changing the
premium to 0 EUR/kWh'”! and by providing that facilities choosing the Pool Price Plus
Premium option beyond 2 February 2013 could not subsequently choose the Regulated
Tariff.!”

216 Secondly, RDL 2/2013 altered the mechanism for updating tariffs, premiums and
remaining elements of remuneration. While the update was previously linked to the CPI,
the Respondent substituted a different index, the “Consumer Price Index at a constant tax
rate”, which, among others, excluded energy products.'7?

MO IET/221/2013

On 14 February 2013, MO IET/221/2013 entered into force and set new values, applicable
as of 1 January 2013, for the Regulated Tariff in respect of both wind farms and CSP plants.
This entailed a reducation of the Regulated Tariff compared to the levels applicable in
2012.1"

The amendments to RFI as described in sections 1. to 5. created a modified regulatory
framework that the Claimant labelled “Regulatory Framework No. 2”. It is referred to
hereinafter as “RF2”.

RDL 9/2013

On 12 July 2013, the Respondent adopted RDL 9/2013, which came into force on 14 July
2013. It amended Article 34 Law 54/1997, i.e. the provision that had created the Special
Regime, and repealed RD 661/2007 altogether.'”> In particular, the amendment to
Article 34(3) Law 54/1997 set the groundwork for a new remunerative regime for
renewable energy producers by providing for:

specific remuneration composed by a term per unit of installed capacity which covers, where
applicable, the investment costs for a standard facility that cannot be recovered through the sale
of energy and a term to the operation which covers, if applicable, the difference between the
operating costs and the revenues from this standard facility participating in the market.

 

To calculate said specific remuneration for a standard facility throughout its regulatory useful
life and based on the activity performed by an efficient and well-managed company, the
following will be taken into account:

a)

The standard revenues from the sale of energy generated valued at the production
market price.

b) The standard operating costs.

c) The standard value of the initial investment.

 

This remuneration regime will not exceed the minimum level necessary to cover the costs which
allow the facilities to compete on equal footing with the other technologies on the market and
which allow a reasonable profitability to be obtained with reference to the standard facility
applicable in each case. [...]

This reasonable profitability will be based on the average yield in the secondary market of ten-
year government bonds applying the appropriate spread, before taxes.!7°

"74 See MoM, {{241, 646; Appendix 4 to MO IET/3586/2011 (C-0089); Appendix 3 to MO IET/221/2013 (C-0374).
"5 RDL 9/2013 (C-0398/R-0094), Article 1 (Second) and Sole Repealing Provision (2)(a).
"76 Law 54/1997, Article 30(4), as revised by RDL 9/2013 (C-0398/R-0094), Article 1 (Second) [as per the Claimant’s

the dent’s is identical in sut ].

41

220 Moreover, in relation to facilities which, upon entry into force of RDL 9/2013, were entitled
to remuneration under the Special Regime, RDL 9/2013 provided that:

a profitability before taxes is established based on the average yield over the last ten years in the
secondary market of ten-year government bonds, increased by 300 basis points, all of the
foregoing without prejudice to the review envisaged in [Article 30(4) Law 54/1997].!77

 

221 ‘In addition, RDL 9/2013 abolished the supplement for reactive energy but maintained the
related penalty.'7*

222 ~=Furthermore, RDL 9/2013 provided that the government would approve a RD “regulating
the legal and economic regime” for renewable energy production facilities, which would
“adapt to the criteria envisaged in” the revised Article 30(4) Law 54/1997.'” Pending such
RD, remuneration would be paid to Special Regime facilities “as a payment on account”
pursuant to the previous economic regime, subject to “regularization” in six settlements
once the new regime entered into force.'*°

223 Asaconsequence, from July 2013 to May 2014, renewable energy producers were paid on
an interim basis in accordance with the previous economic regime, because it took until
June 2014 for RD 413/2014 and MO IET/1045/2014 to set out the details of the new
economic regime.

224 Finally, a so-called “Register of the specific remuneration scheme” (known by the Spanish
acronym “RRRE”) was established and registration of the respective facility in the RRRE
was made a pre-condition to receiving feed-in remuneration.'*!

7. Law 24/2013

225 On 26 December 2013, the Respondent adopted Law 24/2013, which superseded Law
54/1997 and restated the principles of remuneration that had been set out in RDL 9/2013
already, including the rate of profitability for the first regulatory period.!*?

In addition, Law 24/2013 required renewable energy producers to finance a tariff imbalance
up to a limit of 2% for a given financial year (and 5% in terms of accumulated

imbalance).!*°

RD 413/2014

On 16 July 2013, the Respondent submitted a first draft of RD 413/2014 to the CNE for
“urgent mandatory reporting”.'** Following a meeting on 4 September 2013, the CNE
issued a report criticizing a number of aspects of the draft, and stating that the short time
frame did not allow for an effective participation of the CNE and other relevant agencies
in the law-making process.'** In the last week of November 2013, the Respondent
terminated the procedure before the CNE and, on 26 November 2013, submitted a new
draft of RD 413/2014 to the newly created CNMC, which was seen to be closer to the
government’s position.!*°

On 6 June 2014, the Respondent adopted RD 413/2014, which entered into force on 11 June
2014 and set out in more detail the economic regime as introduced by RDL 9/2013 and
restated by Law 24/2013.

Specifically, RD 413/2014 introduced the remuneration parameters “return on investment”
(“RInv”)!®’ and “return on operation” (“ROp”)'®* along with the respective formulas for
their calculation. RInv is a fixed remuneration per unit of installed power, while the ROp
is a fixed remuneration per unit of energy sold. Taken together, RInv and ROp form the
so-called “Specific Remuneration” that Special Regime facilities are entitled to, in
addition to the Pool Price.

In addition, RD 413/2014 introduced the concept of a so-called “Regulatory Lifespan”,
which differs in length depending on the type of facility concerned, and after the expiry of
which period no Specific Remuneration will be paid to the relevant facility.'*” However,
payment of RInv may cease even before the end of the Regulatory Lifespan if the
investment costs for the respective standard facility have already been recovered earlier.!°°

RD 413/2014 also introduced three new thresholds for annual operating hours: First, the
so-called “Maximum Operating Hours”, above which no ROp would be paid.!?!
Secondly, facilities were required each year to reach the so-called “Operating Threshold”,

Thirdly, if a facility exceeded the Operating Threshold but remained below the “minimum
equivalent operating hours” (“Minimum Operating Hours”), the Specific Remuneration
would be reduced proportionally for that year.!°*

232 Moreover, RD 413/2014 provided that if the use of Back-up Fuel exceeds 12% of the
overall energy generation of a given year, no Specific Remuneration will be paid at all for
the relevant year. If this threshold is crossed twice, the facilities’ registration in the RRE
will be cancelled and a fine may be imposed.'**

233 -Finally, RD 413/2014 provided that those facilities that had been receiving feed-in
remuneration until the entry into force of RDL 9/2013 would automatically be registered
in the RRRE on the date set forth in a MO yet to be adopted (which was eventually
promulgated a year later, see section 10. infra).'°°

9. MO IET/1045/2014

234 On 23 July 2013, the Respondent launched a tender process seeking external advice mainly
in the form of reports assessing and establishing the investment and operation costs
standards of facilities operating under the Special Regime. On 20 September 2013, the
Minister of Energy confirmed that Boston Consulting Group (“BCG”) and Roland Berger
were the winners of the tender process and would issue their reports (the “Consultant
Reports”) by the end of November 2013.'°°

235 By a letter dated 31 January 2014, the first draft of MO IET/1045/2014 was released and
submitted to the CNMC.'*’ The Respondent refused to meet requests from members of
parliament that the Consultant Reports be made public. As it turned out later, the Consult
Reports did not yet exist at that time.

236 On3and 4 February 2014, respectively, during a meeting of joint committees of IDAE and
BCG on the one hand, and IDAE and Roland Berger on the other hand, IDAE received
from both companies “the first draft of the final document’.'> Subsequently, IDAE
communicated to Roland Berger (by letter of 24 February 2014)!” and BCG (by letter of
21 March 2014)? that it did not accept the submitted drafts as final reports because they

report, provided that IDAE furnished its updated financial models to Roland Berger.””! By
a letter of 9 April 2014, BCG responded to IDAE’s requests and accepted some, but not all
of them.?

On 16 June 2014, the Respondent promulgated MO IET/1045/2014,7°? which entered into
force on 21 June 2014 and defined different standard facilities, for each of which it set the
relevant values for calculating the applicable remuneration under RD 413/2014. In
particular, this includes RInv, ROp, the Regulatory Lifespan, the Maximum Operating
Hours, the Operating Threshold and the Minimum Operating Hours. For the CSP Plants,
the Regulatory Lifespan was set at 25 years, with the Maximum Operating Hours being
2,040 per year. For the Wind Farms, the Regulatory Lifespan was set at 20 years, and the
ROp was set at 0.

In Appendix II to MO IET/1045/2014, the rate of reasonable profitability was set at 7.398%
pre-tax, being 300 basis points above the average yield in the secondary market for ten-
year state bonds.”

Between 9 July 2014 and 5 August 2014, IDAE and Roland Berger exchanged several
letters on additional amendments requested by IDAE to Roland Berger’s Consultant
Report.2° On 30 September?” and 31 October””’ 2014, IDAE received revised versions of

11. MO IET/1882/2014

241 On 14 October 2014, the Respondent promulgated MO IET/1882/2014, which introduced
a formula for computing the amount of electricity produced attributable to the use of Back-
up Fuel.?!? It also determined the amount of energy production attributable to the use of
Back-up Fuel that was considered necessary for technical reasons and would therefore
benefit from Specific Remuneration.?'* Moreover, MO IET/1882/2014 provided that its
methodology applied as of 1 January 2013 and that any Specific Remuneration paid after
that date for energy attributable to the use of Back-up Fuel needed to be repaid to the extent
that it exceeded the remuneration owed under the new methodology.”!*

242 The amendments to RF2 described in sections 6. to 11. was labelled “Regulatory
Framework No. 3” by the Claimant, and is referred to hereinafter as “RF3”.

F. The Spanish Electricity System (SES) and the Financial and Economic Crisis

243 The SES is operated as a closed economic structure. Its income originates exclusively from
consumers, who pay not only the market price of the energy consumed but also tolls and
charges that are meant to cover the costs of those aspects of the SES that are still regulated,
including notably the subsidies paid to producers of renewable energy.”!> When the income
of the SES is insufficient to cover its costs, a so-called “Tariff Deficit” arises.?'©

244 Each year from 2000 to 2013, the SES produced a Tariff Deficit, before first seeing a
surplus in 2014. The following chart indicates the yearly deficit/surplus and the

As the income of the SES is directly linked to the Spanish energy demand, which in turn is
dependent on the strength of the economy, it is important to note that the global financial
crisis, which started in 2007, entailed a severe economic crisis in Spain from 2008 to 2014.
In particular, after slowing down its growth in 2008, the Spanish GDP decreased in 2009,
remained stable in 2010 and then decreased again in 2011, 2012 and 2013. At the same
time, from 2007 to 2013, the unemployment rate increased from 8.3% in 2007 to 26.1% in
2013.”

In the context of this financial and economic crisis, the Spanish energy demand evolved as
follows:?!°

Due to the merely slight increase in energy consumption in 2008 and the decrease in the
years thereafter, the demand fell increasingly below the forecast of the Spanish regulator
that underlay the Respondent’s Renewable Energy Plans.””° This gap between the forecast
and the actual evolvement of energy demand in Spain is depicted in the following chart”!:

the current situation is unsustainable. The introduction of regulatory measures [...] is called for
with immediate effect in the short term, in order to eliminate the deficit of the system [...]7*

 

On 20 July 2012, in the framework of the EU providing financial assistance to the
Respondent to overcome the economic crisis, the Respondent committed to

address the electricity tariff deficit in a comprehensive way 225

It appears to be undisputed between the Parties that the Disputed Measures have helped
reduce the accumulated Tariff Deficit, and are a main reason why the SES appears to
converge towards financial sustainability, as reflected also in the assessment of the
Disputed Measures by leading rating agencies in 2014, 2015 and 2016.??°

  

The State Aid Decision of the European Commission

On 10 November 2017, the EC issued the EC State Aid Decision on the compliance of RF3
with the EU’s rules on State aid (“EU State Aid Rules”).””” The EC State Aid Decision
reads, in relevant part, as follows:

(157) The investors argue, both before investor-State arbitration tribunals and in their
submissions to the Commission, that by modifying the support scheme with regard to existing
installations, Spain has violated the general principles of Union law of legal certainty and
legitimate expectations.

 

(158) In the very specific situation of the present case, where a Member State grants Staid aid
to investors, without respecting the notification and stand-still obligation of Article 108(3)
TFEU, legitimate expectations with regards to those State aid payments are excluded. That is
because according to the case-law of the Court of Justice, a recipient of State aid cannot, in
principle, have legitimate expectations in the lawfulness of aid that has not been notified to the
Commission. [footnote omitted]

   

LJ

 

  
 

 

(164) In any event, there is also on substance no violation of the [ECT’s] fair and equitable
treatment provisions. As explained above [in paragraphs 157 and 158], in the specific situation
of the present case Spain has not violated the principles of legal certainty and legitimate
expectations under Union law. In an intra-EU situation, Union law is part of the applicable law,
as it constitutes international law applicable between the parties to the dispute. As a result, based
on the principle of interpretation in conformity, the principle of fair and equitable treatment
cannot have a broader scope than the Union law notions of legal certainty and legitimate
expectations in the context of a State aid scheme. In an extra-EU situation, the fair and equitable
treatment pro n of the ECT pected since no investor could have, as a matter of fact, a

that a measure that does not violate domestic provisions on legitimate expectation generally does
not violate the fair and equitable treatment provision.

(165) The Commission recalls that any compensation which an Arbitral Tribunal were to grant
to an investor on the basis that Spain has modified the premium economic scheme by the notified
scheme [...] would be notifiable State aid pursuant to Article 108(3) TFEU and be subject to the
standstill obligation.

 

 

(166) Finally, the Commission recalls that this Decision is part of Union law, and as such also
binding on Arbitral Tribunals, where they apply Union law. The exclusive forum for challenging
its validity are the European Courts.

THE PARTIES’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

The Claimant’s request for relief, as submitted at the hearing, is as follows:??8
“i, DECLARING that the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear all claims submitted by
RENERGY under the Energy Charter Treaty and, consequently, rejecting each of the

preliminary objections that the Respondent raised against the jurisdiction of the Arbitral
Tribunal.

 

ii. DECLARING that the Respondent’s actions and omissions with respect to the Claimant’s
Investment amount to breaches of the Respondent’s obligations under Part III of the Energy
Charter Treaty, as well as under the applicable rules and principles of international law.

iii. ORDERING the Respondent to pay to RENERGY compensation in the amount of
EUR 151” million.

iv. ORDERING Respondent to pay the entire costs of the arbitration and all legal costs and other
expenses incurred by RENERGY.

 

vy. ORDERING Respondent to pay to RENERGY pre and post award interest accrued on all
amounts claimed, compounded, until full payment thereof, at the rates specified by RENERGY.

vi. DECLARING that the Arbitral Tribunal’s Award is made net of all taxes and/or
withholdings, and ORDERING Spain to indemnify Claimants [sic] for any tax liability or
withholding that may be imposed in relation to the compensation awarded in the Tribunal’s
Award.

vii. ORDERING any such further relief as the Arbitral Tribunal may deem appropriate.”

The above request is identical in substance to the request contained in the Claimant’s Reply
on the Merits.7*? While the latter contained also a request for a declaration that the
Respondent may not impose any tax on the Claimant arising from the award, the Tribunal
considers that the substance of this request did no go beyond the (maintained) request for

a declaration that any award be made net of taxes.

(“C-OS"), slides 288f. (italics original).

229 As becomes clear from C-PHB, 232, this includes EUR 10 million as pre-award interest up to November 2018.

230 RoM, 1542.

50

255 Similarly, while in its post-hearing brief the Claimant re-stated the above request for relief
with partially different wording and without requesting a declaration as to the net nature of
any award or an order for indemnification for any tax liability, the Tribunal does not
consider that this was intended to withdraw these previous requests. Instead, the post-
hearing brief expressly requests “an Award as indicating [sic] in the previous submissions
by the Claimant”, followed by a footnote referring to the request for relief submitted in the
Claimant’s opening statement at the hearing.”*! Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the
foregoing requests regarding taxes have been maintained by the Claimant.

256 The Respondent, in turn, requests the Tribunal to:232
“a) Declare that it lacks jurisdiction to hear the Claimant’s claims.

b) Subsidiarily, dismiss all the Claimants claims regarding the merits of the case, as the
Kingdom of Spain has not in any way failed to comply with the ECT;

 

c) Subsidiarily, dismiss all the Claimant’s claims for compensation as it is not entitled to
compensation; and

 

d) Order that the Claimant pays all costs and expenses arising from this arbitration, including
administrative expenses of the ICSID and the fees of the Arbitrator well as the fees of the
legal representation of the Kingdom of Spain, its experts and advi: ind any other costs or
expenses that may have incurred, all of which include a reasonable interest rate from the date
these costs are incurred until the date of their actual payment.”

 

 

Vv. JURISDICTION

257 — The Tribunal will deal in turn with each of the six jurisdictional objections maintained by
the Respondent, as amended and re-labelled by the Respondent during the arbitration.

A. Objection A
1. The Achmea and Komstroy Judgments

258 The Respondent’s Objection A, which is hereinafter also referred to as the “Intra-EU
Objection”, relics heavily on the Achmea Judgment.** The Tribunal has found the
following parts of the Achmea Judgment relevant for its analysis:

“31 By its first and second questions, which should be taken together, the referring court
essentially asks whether Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a
provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of
the BIT, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute
concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member
State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.

  

231 C-PHB, 232.
232 R-PHB, 218, These requests are identical in substance to the ones in CMoM, {1273 and RjoM, 41757.
233 Achmea Judgment (CL-0278/RL-0135).

Sl

32 In order to answer those questions, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law of
the Court, an international agreement cannot affect the allocation of powers fixed by the Treaties
or, consequently, the autonomy of the EU legal system, observance of which is ensured by the
Court. That principle is enshrined in particular in Article 344 TFEU, under which the Member
States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the
Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for in the Treaties [reference
omitted].

33 Also according to settled case-law of the Court, the autonomy of EU law with respect both
to the law of the Member States and to international law is justified by the essential
characteristics of the EU and its law, relating in particular to the constitutional structure of the
EU and the very nature of that law. EU law is characterised by the fact that it stems from an
independent source of law, the Treaties, by its primacy over the laws of the Member States, and
by the direct effect of a whole series of provisions which are applicable to their nationals and to
the Member States themselves. Those characteristics have given rise to a structured network of
principles, rules and mutually interdependent legal relations binding the EU and its Member
States reciprocally and binding its Member States to each other [reference omitted].

 

 

34 EU law is thus based on the fundamental premiss that each Member State shares with all the
other Member States, and recognises that they share with it, a set of common values on which
the EU is founded, as stated in Article 2 TEU. That premiss implies and justifies the existence
of mutual trust between the Member States that those values will be recognised, and therefore
that the law of the EU that implements them will be respected. It is precisely in that context that
the Member States are obliged, by reason inter alia of the principle of sincere cooperation set
out in the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) TEU, to ensure in their respective territories the
application of and respect for EU law, and to take for those purposes any appropriate measure,
whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligation: sing out of the Treaties
or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the EU [reference omitted].

     

 

 

 

 

35 In order to ensure that the specific characteristics and the autonomy of the EU legal order are
preserved, the Treaties have established a judicial system intended to ensure consistency and
uniformity in the interpretation of EU law [reference omitted].

     

36 In that context, in accordance with Article 19 TEU, it is for the national courts and tribunals
and the Court of Justice to ensure the full application of EU law in all Member States and to
ensure judicial of the rights of individuals under that law omitted].

 

37 In particular, the judicial system as thus conceived has as its keystone the preliminary ruling
procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, which, by setting up a dialogue between one court
and another, specifically between the Court of Justice and the courts and tribunals of the Member
States, has the object of securing uniform interpretation of EU law, thereby serving to ensure its
consistency, its full effect and its autonomy as well as, ultimately, the particular nature of the
law established by the Treaties [reference omitted].

 

  

 

38 The first and second questions referred for a preliminary ruling must be answered in the light
of those considerations.

39 It must be ascertained, first, whether the disputes which the arbitral tribunal mentioned in
Article 8 of the BIT is called on to resolve are liable to relate to the interpretation or application
of EU law.

40 Even if, as Achmea in particular contends, that tribunal, despite the very broad wording of
Article 8(1) of the BIT, is called on to rule only on possible infringements of the BIT, the fact
remains that in order to do so it must, in accordance with Article 8(6) of the BIT, take account
in particular of the law in force of the contracting party concerned and other relevant agreements
between the contracting parties.

 

52

41 Given the nature and characteristics of EU law mentioned in paragraph 33 above, that law
must be regarded both as forming part of the law in force in every Member State and as deriving
from an international agreement between the Member States.

 

42 It follows that on that twofold basis the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 of the BIT
may be called on to interpret or indeed to apply EU law, particularly the provisions concerning
the fundamental freedoms, including freedom of establishment and free movement of capital.

 

43 It must therefore be ascertained, secondly, whether an arbitral tribunal such as that referred
to in Article 8 of the BIT is situated within the judicial system of the EU, and in particular
whether it can be regarded as a court or tribunal of a Member State within the meaning of Article
267 TFEU. The consequence of a tribunal set up by Member States being situated within the EU
judicial system is that its decisions are subject to mechanis capable of ensuring the full
effectiveness of the rules of the EU [reference omitted].

 

     

44 In the case in which judgment was given on 12 June 2014, Ascendi Beiras Litoral e Alta,
Auto Estradas das Beiras Litoral e Alta (C-377/13, EU:C:2014:1754), the Court derived the
status of ‘court or tribunal of a Member State’ of the tribunal in question from the fact that the
tribunal as a whole was part of the system of judicial resolution of tax disputes provided for by
the Portuguese constitution itself [reference omitted].

45 In the case in the main proceedings, the arbitral tribunal is not part of the judicial system of
the Netherlands or Slovakia. Indeed, it is precisely the exceptional nature of the tribunal’s
jurisdiction compared with that of the courts of those two Member States that is one of the
principal reasons for the existence of Article 8 of the BIT.

46 That characteristi
in any event be cla
267 TFEU.

 

of the arbitral tribunal at issue in the main proceedings means that it cannot
fied as a court or tribunal ‘of a Member State’ within the meaning of Article

 

47 The Court has indeed held that there is no good reason why a court common to a number of
Member States, such as the Benelux Court of Justice, should not be able to submit questions to
the Court for a preliminary ruling in the same way as the courts or tribunals of any one of the
Member States [references omitted].

48 However, the arbitral tribunal at issue in the main proceedings is not such a court common
to anumber of Member States, comparable to the Benelux Court of Justice. Whereas the Benelux
Court has the task of ensuring that the legal rules common to the three Benelux States are applied
uniformly, and the procedure before it is a step in the proceedings before the national courts
leading to definitive interpretations of common Benelux legal rules, the arbitral tribunal at issue
in the main proceedings does not have any such links with the judicial systems of the Member
States [reference omitted].

49 It follows that a tribunal such as that referred to in Article 8 of the BIT cannot be regarded as
a ‘court or tribunal of a Member State’ within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU, and is not
therefore entitled to make a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling.

50 In those circumstances, it remains to be ascertained, thirdly, whether an arbitral award made
by such a tribunal is, in accordance with Article 19 TEU in particular, subject to review by a
court of a Member State, ensuring that the questions of EU law which the tribunal may have to
address can be submitted to the Court by means of a reference for a preliminary ruling.

51 It should be noted that under Article 8(7) of the BIT the decision of the arbitral tribunal

provided for in that article is final. Moreover, pursuant to Article 8(5) of the BIT, the arbitral
tribunal is to determine its own procedure applying the UNCITRAL arbitration rules and, in

53

particular, is itself to choose its seat and consequently the law applicable to the procedure
governing judicial review of the validity of the award by which it puts an end to the dispute
before it.

 

52 In the present case, the arbitral tribunal applied to by Achmea chose to sit in Frankfurt am
Main, which made German law applicable to the procedure governing judicial review of the
validity of the arbitral award made by the tribunal on 7 December 2012. It was thus that choice
which enabled the Slovak Republic, as a party to the dispute, to seek judicial review of the
arbitral award, in accordance with German law, by bringing proceedings to that end before the
competent German court.

 

53 However, such judicial review can be exercised by that court only to the extent that national
law permits. Moreover, Paragraph 1059(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure provides only for
limited review, concerning in particular the validity of the arbitration agreement under the
applicable law and the consistency with public policy of the recognition or enforcement of the
arbitral award.

54 It is true that, in relation to commercial arbitration, the Court has held that the requirements
of efficient arbitration proceedings justify the review of arbitral awards by the courts of the
Member States being limited in scope, provided that the fundamental provisions of EU law can
be examined in the course of that review and, if necessary, be the subject of a reference to the
Court for a preliminary ruling [references omitted].

55 However, arbitration proceedings such as those referred to in Article 8 of the BIT are different
from commercial arbitration proceedings. While the latter originate in the freely expressed
wishes of the parties, the former derive from a treaty by which Member States agree to remove
from the jurisdiction of their own courts, and hence from the system of judicial remedies which
the second subparagraph of Article 19(1) TEU requires them to establish in the fields covered
by EU law [reference omitted], disputes which may concern the application or interpretation of
EU law. In those the ‘ions set out in the h relating
to commercial arbitration cannot be applied to arbitration proceedings such as those referred to
in Article 8 of the BIT.

 

56 Consequently, having regard to all the characteristics of the arbitral tribunal mentioned in
Article 8 of the BIT and set out in paragraphs 39 to 55 above, it must be considered that, by
concluding the BIT, the Member States parties to it established a mechanism for settling disputes
between an investor and a Member State which could prevent those disputes from being resolved
in a manner that ensures the full effectiveness of EU law, even though they might concern the
interpretation or application of that law.

57 It is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an international agreement providing
tablishment of a court responsible for the interpretation of its provisions and whose

s are binding on the institutions, including the Court of Justice, is not in principle
incompatible with EU law. The competence of the EU in the field of international relations and
its capacity to conclude international agreements necessarily entail the power to submit to the
decisions of a court which is created or designated by such agreements as regards the
interpretation and application of their provisions, provided that the autonomy of the EU and its
legal order is respected [reference omitted].

  

58 In the present case, however, apart from the fact that the disputes falling within the
jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 of the BIT may relate to the
interpretation both of that agreement and of EU law, the possibility of submitting those disputes.
to a body which is not part of the judicial system of the EU is provided for by an agreement
which was concluded not by the EU but by Member States. Article 8 of the BIT is such as to
call into question not only the principle of mutual trust between the Member States but also the
preservation of the particular nature of the law established by the Treaties, ensured by the

54

preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, and is not therefore compatible
with the principle of sincere cooperation referred to in paragraph 34 above.

59 In those circumstances, Article 8 of the BIT has an adverse effect on the autonomy of EU
law.

60 Consequently, the answer to Questions | and 2 is that Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be
interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member
States, such as Article 8 of the BIT, under which an investor from one of those Member States
may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring
proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that
Member State has undertaken to accept.

[.]
62 [..]

 

On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international
agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on
encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the
Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under which an investor from one
of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other
Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal
whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.”

 

 

  

 

259 Moreover, the Tribunal has found the following paragraphs of the Komstroy Judgment

relevant to its analysis:**4

“47 It is in the light of the foregoing considerations that the question whether a dispute between.
a Member State and an investor of another Member State concerning an investment made by the
latter in the first Member State may be subject to arbitration proceedings under Article 26(2)(c)
ECT must be examined.

 

48 To that end, in the first place, it should be noted that, in accordance with Article 26(6) ECT,
the arbitral tribunal provided for in paragraph 4 of that article is to rule on the issues in dispute
in accordance with the ECT and with the applicable rules and principles of international law.

 

49 As stated in paragraph 23 of this judgment, the ECT itself is an act of EU law.

50 It follows that an arbitral tribunal such as that referred to in Article 26(6) ECT is required to
interpret, and even apply, EU law.

51 It must therefore be ascertained, in the second place, whether such an arbitral tribunal is
situated within the judicial system of the European Union, and in particular whether it can be
regarded as a court or tribunal of a Member State within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU. The
consequence of a tribunal set up by Member States being situated within the EU judicial system
is that its decisions are subject to mechanisms capable of ensuring the full effectiveness of the
rules of the European Union (judgment of 6 March 2018, Achmea, C-284/16, EU:C:2018:158,
paragraph 43 and the case-law cited).

    

24 Komstroy Judgment (RL-0173).

55

52 In the precisely same way as the arbitral tribunal at issue in the case giving rise to the
judgment of 6 March 2018, Achmea (C-284/16, EU:C:2018:158, paragraph 45), an ad hoc
arbitral tribunal, such as that referred to in Article 26(6) ECT, does not constitute a component
of the judicial system of a Member State, in this case the French Republic. Indeed it is precisely
the exceptional nature of that court’s jurisdiction, by comparison with that of the courts of the
contracting parties to the ECT, which is one of the main reasons for the existence of
Article 26(2)(c) and (4) of that treaty. That is all the more so given that, if the arbitral tribunal
concerned were one of the courts of a Contracting Party to that treaty, it would be included
amongst the courts referred to in Article 26(2)(a) ECT and thus Article 26(2)(c) ECT would lose
any effectiveness.

  

 

 

 

 

53 That characteristic of such an arbitral tribunal means that it cannot, in any event, be classified
as a court or tribunal ‘of a Member State’ within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU, and is not
therefore entitled to make a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling (see, by analogy,
judgment of 6 March 2018, Achmea, C-284/16, EU:C:2018:158, paragraphs 46 and 49).

  

 

54 In those circumstances, it remains to be ascertained, in the third place, whether an arbitral
award made by such a tribunal is, in accordance with Article 19 TEU in particular, subject to
review by a court of a Member State and whether that review is capable of ensuring full
compliance with EU law guaranteeing that questions of EU law which the tribunal may have to
ry, be submitted to the Court by means of a reference for a preliminary

  

55 To that end, it should be noted that, under Article 26(8) ECT, arbitral awards are final and
binding on the parties to the dispute concerned. In addition, by application of Article 26(4) ECT,
a dispute, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, may be brought before an ad hoc
arbitration tribunal on the basis of the Uncitral arbitration rules, with that arbitral tribunal
determining its own procedural rules in accordance with those arbitration rules.

 

 

 

 

56 In the present case, as has been recalled in paragraph 32 of the present judgment, the parties
i i i hose, in accordance with Article 26(4)(b) ECT,
to submit that dispute to an ad hoc arbitration tribunal, established on the bi of the Uncitral
arbitration rules, and thus accepted, in accordance with those arbitration rules, that the seat of
the arbitration tribunal should be established in Paris, which made French law applicable to the
proceedings before the referring court, whose purpose was the judicial review of the arbitration
award made by that tribunal.

 

    

57 However, such judicial review can be carried out by the referring court only in so far as the
domestic law of its Member State so permits. Article 1520 of the Code of Civil Procedure
provides only for limited review concerning, in particular, the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.

58 It is true that, in relation to commercial arbitration, the Court has held that the requirements
of efficient arbitration proceedings justify the review of arbitral awards by the courts of the
Member States being limited in scope, provided that the fundamental provisions of EU law can
be examined in the course of that review and they can, if necessary, be the subject of a reference
to the Court for a preliminary ruling (judgment of 6 March 2018, Achmea, C-284/16,
EU:C:2018:158, paragraph 54 and the case-law cited).

59 However, arbitration proceedings such as those referred to in Article 26 ECT are different
from commercial arbitration proceedings. While the latter originate in the freely expr
wishes of the parties concerned, the former derives from a treaty whereby, in accordance with
Article 26(3)(a) ECT, Member States agree to remove from the jurisdiction of their own courts
and, hence, from the system of judicial remedies which the second subparagraph of Article 19(1)
TEU requires them to establish in the fields covered by EU law (see, to that effect, judgment of
27 February 2018, Associagaio Sindical dos Juizes Portugueses, C-64/16, EU:C:2018:117,
paragraph 34), disputes which may concern the application or interpretation of that law. In those

 

 

 

56

the i ions set out in the di relating to ial
arbitration do not apply to arbitration proceedings such as those referred to in Article 26(2(c)
ECT (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 March 2018, Achmea, C-284/16, EU:C:2018:158,

paragraph 55).

60 Having regard to all the characteristics of the arbitral tribunal set out in paragraphs 48 to 59
of the present judgment, it must be considered that, if the provisions of Article 26 ECT allowing
such a tribunal to be entrusted with the resolution of a dispute were to apply as between an
investor of one Member State and another Member State, it would mean that, by concluding the
ECT, the European Union and the Member States which are parties to it established a mechanism.
for settling such a dispute that could exclude the possibility that that dispute, notwithstanding
the fact that it concerns the interpretation or application of EU law, would be resolved in a
manner that guarantees the full effectiveness of that law (see, by analogy, judgment of 6 March
2018, Achmea, C-284/16, EU:C:2018:158, paragraph 56).

 

61 It is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an international agreement providing
for the establishment of a court responsible for the interpretation of its provisions and whose
decisions are binding on the EU institutions, including the Court of Justice of the European
Union, is not in principle incompatible with EU law. The competence of the European Union in
the field of international relations and its capacity to conclude international agreements
sions of a court which is created or designated
by such agreements as regards the interpretation and application of their provisions, provided
that the autonomy of the European Union and its legal order is respected (judgment of 6 March
2018, Achmea, C-284/16, EU:C:2018:158, paragraph 57 and the case-law cited).

 

 

62 However, the exercise of the European Union’s competence in international matters cannot
extend to permitting, in an international agreement, a provision according to which a dispute
between an investor of one Member State and another Member State concerning EU law may
be removed from the judicial system of the European Union such that the full effectiveness of
that law is not guaranteed.

 

s the Court held in the case giving rise to the judgment of 6 March
2018, Achmea mC 284/16, EU:C:2018:158, paragraph 58) and as the Advocate General observed
in essence in point 83 of his Opinion, call into question the preservation of the autonomy and of
the particular nature of the law established by the Treaties, ensured in particular by the
preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU.

64 It should be noted in that regard that, despite the multilateral nature of the international
agreement of which it forms part, a provision such as Article 26 ECT is intended, in reality, to
govern bilateral relations between two of the Contracting Parties, in an analogous way to the
provision of the bilateral investment treaty at issue in the case giving rise to the judgment of
6 March 2018, Achmea (C-284/16, EU:C:2018:158, paragraph 58).

  
 

65 It follows that, although the ECT may require Member States to comply with the arbitral
mechanisms for which it provides in their relations with investors from third States who are also
Contracting Parties to that treaty as regards investments made by the latter in those Member
States, preservation of the autonomy and of the particular nature of EU law precludes the same
obligations under the ECT from being imposed on Member States as between themselves.

66 In the light of the foregoing, it must be concluded that Article 26(2)(c) ECT must be

interpreted as not being applicable to disputes between a Member State and an investor of
another Member State concerning an investment made by the latter in the first Member State.”

2. The Respondent’s Principal Arguments
a. EU Member States as the Same Contracting Party vis-a-vis Each Other

260 According to the Respondent, Article 26(1) ECT deals with disputes arising between a
contracting party to the ECT (“Contracting Party”) and an Investor of another
Contracting Party concerning Investments of the latter in the Area of the former. The
Respondent argues that in light of the object and purpose of the ECT, and the legal
framework and cooperation it establishes, in particular its Part III, it is evident that the EU
Member States have fully transferred the intra-EU competences dealt with and applied in
the ECT to the EU, which is also a Contracting Party to the ECT. As a consequence, EU
Member States are not “another Contracting Party” and another “Area” to each other under
the ECT and EU Member States could not have agreed on, and could not be bound by,
something the necessary competence for which they had already transferred to the EU.
Within the EU, the ECT and the EU share the same purpose, and the EU is the competent
Contracting Party to the ECT for such matters.’*> According to the Respondent, it would
have been nonsensical for EU Member States to enter into an agreement to cover an area
between them which had already been comprehensively, and better, covered for years by
EU law — however, in the Respondent’s view, this is what it would mean to interpret the
ECT as applicable intra-EU.?*°

261 According to the Respondent, Article 1(3) ECT (as well as Articles 1(2) ECT and 36(7)
ECT) have expressly contemplated the transfer of competence to “Regional Economic
Integration Organisations” (“REIOs”) as it has taken place from EU Member States to the
EU in matters covered by the ECT.?*’ Quoting Electrabel v. Hungary, the Respondent
submits that

the possible interference with a foreign investment through the implementation by an EU
Member State of a legally binding decision of the European Commission was and remains
inherent in the framework of the ECT itself.°*

 

262 Therefore, according to the Respondent, intra-EU disputes are excluded from the scope of
the ECT.?

b. Applicability of EU Law

263 The Respondent submits that, as confirmed by the Komstroy Judgment, Article 26(6) ECT
requires that (i) the dispute be settled in accordance with the ECT and other principles and
tules of international law, that (ii) EU law is international law and that, thus, (iii) the
Tribunal must apply EU law.”“° The Respondent adds that EU law must also be taken into
account as a relevant rule of international law applicable in the relations between the Parties
in the sense of Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
(“VCLT”)."' In addition, according to the Respondent, the primacy of EU law also makes
it the applicable law to resolve the present dispute.“

264 The Respondent adds that, in its view, EU law is also applicable in the Tribunal’s ex officio
analysis of its jurisdiction. 47

c Primacy of EU Law

265 According to the Respondent, EU law must be applied as interpreted by the CJEU,*“ and
any potential conflict arising between the ECT and EU law must thus be resolved in favour
of EU law by the principle of autonomy and primacy of EU law (see below),”° which is
expressly recognised by Article 25 ECT?“ and also forms part of customary international
law and the Treaty of Lisbon.?4”

266 The Respondent argues that the Tribunal should interpret the ECT as an act of the EU
and, thus, in harmony with EU law.2? In its submissions on the Komstroy Judgment, the
Respondent adds that according to the judgment, the ECT, as an act of the EU, forms part
of EU law.?*° Therefore, according to the Respondent, with the CJEU being the supreme
interpreter of EU law, its interpretation of the ECT is binding on the Tribunal.”*!

267 The Respondent submits that the primacy of the EU law was known to the Contracting
Parties that were also EU Member States when they entered into the ECT, such as the
Respondent and Luxembourg. These States thus knew that EU law had primacy over the

ECT when entering into the ECT, and their whole participation in the ECT must be seen in
that light.?>?

Inapplicability of Article 26 ECT to Intra-EU Cases

According to the Respondent, Articles 267 and 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union?** (“TFEU”) prescribe that EU law cannot be subject to any dispute
resolution outside the EU judicial system.?* In the view of the Respondent, this was
confirmed in the Achmea and Komstroy Judgments.”°°

The Respondent submits that, with that in mind, the EU and the EU Member States, as
Contracting Parties to the ECT, could never have intended to adopt rules incompatible with
their obligations under the the TFEU and the Treaty on European Union?® (“TEU”,
together with the TFEU the “EU Treaties”). As such, Article 26 ECT was never, and could
never have been, meant by the EU Member States as an intra-EU arbitration clause. The
Respondent adds that this interpretation is also confirmed by the 22 Member States
Declaration (see section i. infra).?°’

The Respondent submits that, in addition, the dispute at hand concerns essential elements
of EU law (EU State Aid Rules and competition law as well as all four fundamental
freedoms), and that a decision on such topics falls within the sole competence of the CJEU,
not an ICSID tribunal which is not part of the EU hierarchy.?°*

Primacy of EU Law as a Conflict Rule and Lex Posterior to Article 26 ECT

According to the Respondent, if the Tribunal nevertheless deemed that a conflict existed
between the provisions of the ECT and EU law, such a conflict would have to be resolved
by public international law. The Respondent submits that as a result of a public
international law analysis, the Tribunal would have to give precedence to the specific rules
for the resolution of conflicts which are provided by EU law.?? In the view of the
Respondent, the principle of primacy of EU law is not only an interpretative criterion, but
a special conflict rule, which takes precedence over the general rules of conflict as reflected
in Article 30(3) to (5) VCLT.7°°

The Respondent further submits that the principle of primacy of EU law also constitutes a
lex posterior to the ECT because it was codified in the Treaty of Lisbon, after the

conclusion of the ECT.”°! According to the Respondent, the EU Treaties do not only share,
but also exceed the object and purpose of the ECT, and as such are later treaties on the
same subject-matter in the sense of Articles 30 and 59 VCLT.?

In reference to Article 16 ECT, and regarding the question of which regime is more
favourable to investors, the Respondent submits that Article 26 ECT does not establish an
order of preference between the different dispute settlement mechanisms it provides for,
i.e. the Article does not prefer the dispute resolution by national courts over arbitration and
vice versa. Therefore, according to the Respondent, Article 26 ECT does not establish that
arbitration would be more favourable to an investor than dispute settlement by a national
court.°”

The Achmea Judgment

Turning to the Achmea Judgment, the Respondent submits that in that judgment the CIEU
does not limit itself to BITs.”°

The Respondent further notes that in the Achmea Judgment the CJEU established two
conditions that would necessitate the invalidation of an intra~-EU arbitration clause.
Specifically, an invalidation is necessary (i) in case the dispute that a tribunal is called to
resolve relates to the interpretation or application of EU law and (ii) in case the CJEU is
impeded from exercising its powers, e.g. through the preliminary ruling procedure. Since,
according to the Respondent, both conditions are met, i.e. EU law must be applied and is
relevant (see {270 infra), and the CJEU cannot be seized of the matter, it must follow that
the Achmea Judgment applies to the arbitration clause in this case and that said clause must
therefore be invalidated.?°>

The Respondent recalls that EU law must be applied as interpreted by the CJEU.2

The Komstroy Judgment

Turning to the Komstroy Judgment, the Respondent submits that the CJEU declared that
intra-EU investment arbitration under the ECT is not possible and confirmed the

Respondent’s earlier arguments in this case and its earlier interpretation of the Achmea
Judgment.”

In the view of the Respondent, the Komstroy Judgment underlines that with the Treaty of
Lisbon, the EU acquired exclusive competences in the field of foreign direct investment.”

The Respondent submits that when dealing with intra-EU investment arbitration, the
Komstroy Judgment exactly follows the reasoning of the Achmea Judgment, as the
Respondent had outlined it before (see above). The Respondent points out that the
judgment concludes that intra-EU investment arbitration is prohibited and not compatible
with the EU Treaties — independent of whether the bilateral obligation to arbitrate exists
within a BIT, or between two parties to a multilateral agreement, such as the ECT.

According to the Respondent, in the Komstroy Judgment, the CJEU recalled that because
the ECT is an act adopted by the EU institutions, its provisions are part of the EU’s legal
framework, and therefore, the CJEU is competent to decide preliminary questions on its
interpretation.?”” However, the Respondent argues that if the ECT thus forms part of EU
law and EU law is to be exclusively interpreted by the CJEU, which, in the Komstroy
Judgment, decided that intra-EU investment arbitration under the ECT is not possible, then
the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.?”! According to the Respondent, a citizen of an EU Member
State cannot rely on an arbitration agreement and an offer to arbitrate on which its Member
State, as a consequence of a judgment of its highest court, the CJEU, could not rely

272
anymore.

Lack of a Disconnection Clause

The Respondent submits that the lack of an explicit disconnection clause in the ECT is
irrelevant because EU law takes primacy in any case.?”* According to the Respondent, this
conclusion is supported by the views of the EC, as expressed, for example, in its comments
on the necessity for a disconnection clause in the Convention on jurisdiction and the
recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters of 21 December
2007 (the “Lugano Convention”).”” It is further supported by many international treaties
from which intra-EU relations are “disconnected” even though no disconnection clause has
been included in them.””>

The EU Member States Declarations

According to the Respondent, the 22 Member States Declaration establishes that
arbitrations under the ECT between an investor from an EU Member State and another EU
Member State are incompatible with EU law. ?’° The Respondent regards the 22 Member
States Declaration as a demonstration of the will of “the States that signed the ECT” as to

how Article 26 ECT should be interpreted in relation to EU law,2”” and a reflection of a
subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the authentic interpretation of the
treaty in the sense of Article 31(3)(a) VCLT.2* According to the Respondent, the
22 Member States Declaration, in any case, represents subsequent practice in the sense of
Article 31(3)(b) VCLT.2”

283 The Respondent adds that the Five Member States Declaration is silent on the applicability
of the Achmea Judgment on cases under the ECT because, instead of arguing a point, it
only expresses a preference to await a judgment of the CJEU on the subject. This in turn
shows, according to the Respondent, that in the view of those five EU Member States, the
CJEU is the supreme interpreter on the issue of applicability of EU law to the ECT.”* In
the view of the Respondent, the Five Member States Declaration does not jeopardise the
interpretation of the 22 Member States Declaration as a reflection of a subsequent
agreement regarding the interpretation of a treaty, because Article 31(3)(a) VCLT (i)
contemplates that such an agreement is not made between all parties to a treaty, and (ii)
has, in the past, been interpreted in a very “non-formalistic” way.?*!

284 The Respondent argues that it is the common ground of all three EU Member States
Declarations that they acknowledge the principle of autonomy and primacy of EU law, and
acknowledge that EU law offers a comprehensive and effective legal framework to intra-
EU investors.7*

3. The Claimant’s Principal Arguments
a. Intra-EU Effect of the ECT

285 According to the Claimant, Article 26 ECT has intra-EU effect according to the plain
meaning of the Article (read in conjunction with Article 1 ECT)*** and as supported by
case law.?** In particular, the Claimant argues that the term “Area” in Article 26 ECT
cannot form a hurdle to jurisdiction in this case as it can only refer to the territory of the
respective EU Member State in question, not to the territory of the entire EU.7*> The

Claimant adds that the Respondent’s reading of Article 26 ECT would have required a
disconnection clause in the ECT.”*°

286 The Claimant points out that the travaux préparatoires of the ECT confirm the applicability
of the ECT to intra-EU disputes.”*’ The Claimant submits that during the negotiation of the
ECT a disconnection clause was suggested by the EU, but not accepted by the other
signatory States, as was highlighted also in Blusun vs. Italy.?°° The Claimant notes that
eventually a very specific exception with respect to the Svalbard Treaty”*? was negotiated
into the ECT, while no exception with regard to intra-EU relations was included in its final
text. According to the Claimant, the fact that a minor exception was included, but a major
exception, such as the intra-EU exception, was rejected and did not make it into the final
version of the Treaty, also stands in the way of implying the intra-EU exception into the
terms of the ECT.’ In that regard, the Claimant argues that contrary to how the
Respondent relies on and interprets the Lugano Convention, that convention further
illustrates that the EU consistently followed the practice of introducing disconnection
clauses when it considered that intra-EU relations should be governed by EU law rather
than the respective international treaty.2?! Moreover, in the Claimant’s view, the EC had
endorsed the application of the ECT to intra-EU disputes in its statements in the case
Electrabel v. Hungary.”

287 According to the Claimant, the ECT is a mixed agreement which needed to be signed by
the EU and the EU Member States because of their shared competence in energy matters
(Article 4(2)(i) TFEU).% The Claimant argues, however, that this circumstance has no
effect on the possibility of intra-EU disputes under the ECT." Nor, according to the
Claimant, does the definition of REIO in Article 1(3) ECT or the granting of voting rights
to the EU under Article 36(7) ECT have any such effect.?°>

b. Validity and Binding Effect of the ECT between Luxembourg and Spain

288 The Claimant submits that Luxembourg and the Respondent had the competence to enter
into the ECT and to allow the settlement of intra-EU disputes under it.2°° The Claimant
points out that (i) the ECT has not been amended, that (ii) even if attempts to that effect

not been followed, nor begun, and that (iii) the ECT has not been suspended in the sense
of Article 58 VCLT.?”

c Inapplicability of EU Law to a Decision on Jurisdiction

289 According to the Claimant, EU law is, as confirmed by case law, irrelevant for the question
of jurisdiction in this case, because that question is exclusively governed by Articles 25
and 26 of the ICSID Convention together with Article 26(1) to (5) of the ECT.7*

290 The Claimant furthermore argues that because EU law is not applicable between all
Contracting Parties to the ECT, it can also not be applicable in an ECT case between EU
Member States.”°? In the view of the Claimant, the interpretation of the ECT should be
coherent between all its Contracting Parties, including the Contracting Parties that are not
EU Member States, and that requirement of coherence prohibits the application of EU law
between only some Contracting Parties.*°°

291 The Claimant submits that the current case is not an EU State aid case and that the
applicable law to resolve the merits of the dispute is the ECT.*°! However, the Claimant
adds that, even if the question whether or not the incentives that Spain granted to renewable
companies were compliant with the EU State Aid Rules, the fundamental freedoms, or
competition law of the EU did play a role in the merits of this dispute, those questions
would have nothing to do with the Tribunal’s determination of its jurisdiction. *°

d. Irrelevance of the Primacy of EU Law

292 The Claimant submits that the Respondent only relies on the primacy of EU law to avoid
the analysis of the jurisdictional provisions of the ECT.* However, according to the
Claimant, that attempt must fail as EU law has no primacy over the ECT and as the ECT,
together with the ICSID Convention, form the Tribunal’s sole “Constitution” as outlined,
for example, in the RREEF v. Spain case.*™ If the European Commission is the guardian
of the EU Treaties, the Claimant submits, then “this Arbitral Tribunal is the guardian of

the ECT and the ICSID Convention”>° EU law, according to the Claimant, cannot and
does not modify the ECT provisions.*°°

The Claimant further argues that in particular ICSID Tribunals constituted under the ECT
are not within the European Legal Order as they only rely on the ICSID Convention and
the ECT and, according to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, their awards could also not
be annulled for being contrary to the EU legal order.*””

Resolution of a Conflict of Laws

Based on the above, the Claimant’s main position is that there is no inconsistency,
incompatibility, or conflict between the ECT and the EU Treaties.*” Investor-State
arbitration in intra-EU disputes under the ECT, according to the Claimant, does not
contravene EU law.*”

However, even if there were any such conflict, the Claimant argues that, as case law shows,
neither Article 344 TFEU, nor the Achmea Judgment (see below), can be invoked to justify
the Intra-EU Objection.?!°

The Claimant argues that, equally, Article 25 ECT, on which the Respondent relies to
establish supremacy of EU law, merely avoids extension of preferential treatment granted
by EU law to third parties, and is thus neither a conflict rule nor does it establish supremacy
of EU law over the provisions of the ECT.*!!

The Claimant submits that the applicable conflict rule is Article 16 ECT, which provides
that in the case of a conflict, the more favourable rule for the investor prevails.*!? As EU
law does not provide an investor with the right to file a claim before an independent tribunal
outside the forum state, according to the Claimant, the ECT offers the more favourable rule
for the investor, and thus prevails.*!

As regards potential arguments of /ex posterior or an implied termination by a later treaty,

the Claimant submits that the EU Treaties and the ECT do not have the same subject-

As regards Article 31(3)(c) VCLT, the Claimant submits that it is merely “a tool of

Irrelevance of the Achmea Judgment

The Claimant argues that the Achmea Judgment is irrelevant in the present case for various
reasons.

First, according to the Claimant, the Achmea Judgment is irrelevant because it relates only
to bilateral investment treaties and is silent on multilateral treaties such as the ECT and the
ICSID Convention.*'® In particular, the Claimant stresses that the BIT with which the
Achmea Judgment dealt required the application of internal law to the merits of a case, not
just the application of international law, as is the case with the ECT.*'”

Secondly, according to the Claimant, even if the Achmea Judgment expressly referred to
multilateral treaties such as the ECT and the ICSID Convention, which it did not, the
Judgment cannot supersede, or alter, the EU’s and the EU Member States’ international
obligations under Articles 25 and 53-55 of the ICSID Convention.*!* The Claimant adds
that, given also Article 216 TFEU, the EU and its institutions, including the CJEU, must
abide by the international obligations of the EU and thus no interpretation of EU law could
allow the EU to breach the ECT.3!

Thirdly, the Claimant notes that the Achmea Judgment expressly recognizes the EU’s
power to conclude international agreements that provide for a court responsible for the
interpretation of such treaties.*”° In that regard, the Claimant underlines that in the case at
hand, there is no risk that the autonomy of EU law would be undermined, in particular,
because no EU law act applies directly to the merits of the case, and no conflict between
the ECT and EU law exists (as confirmed by other tribunals).*?!

Fourthly, the Claimant argues that, as the Tribunal is seised in an international law context,
for the Tribunal the Achmea Judgment is but an internal court decision of a Contracting
Party to the ECT. >? The Claimant recalls that Article 27 VCLT prevents all States from

Fifthly, the Claimant submits that the EU, itself or through its courts, cannot unilaterally
amend the ECT, as this would violate the ECT’s provisions on amendments.**+ The
Claimant notes that the Achmea Judgment does not comply with any of the requirements
of Art. 58 VCLT for the suspension of a treaty and that suspension would also not be the
effect intended by the CJEU for its judgments.*?>

Sixthly, the Claimant submits that the Achmea Judgment cannot retroactively invalidate
the Respondent’s unconditional consent to arbitration given long before the date of the
Achmea Judgment.*”°

The Claimant concludes that the Achmea Judgement “does not reach” the ECT, does not
bind an ICSID tribunal constituted under the ECT, does not invalidate ECT provisions, and
could not retroactively invalidate the Respondent’s consent to arbitration.*?’

Case Law before and after the Achmea Judgment

According to the Claimant, already in 2018, close to twenty arbitral awards had
unanimously confirmed their jurisdiction in intra-EU cases under Article 26 ECT, and the
rejection of the Intra-EU Objection forms one of the rare cases of uniform jurisprudence
constante in investment arbitration.>”

Irrelevance of the Komstroy Judgment

The Claimant submits that the Komstroy Judgment is as irrelevant to the present case as
the Achmea Judgment, not least, because its dispositive part, i.e. the part of the judgment
that is binding on the court that posed the preliminary questions, only deals with the
definition of “Investment” under the ECT.*”? According to the Claimant, the CJEU’s
considerations on Article 26 of the ECT in the Komstroy Judgment are obiter dicta. They
may require future action of EU Member States, but do not require any action by investors
or tribunals in ongoing arbitrations under the ECT, which is a treaty that has neither been
amended nor, in view of Articles 27, 42, 46, and 47 ECT, properly been denounced by the
EU and its Member States, including the Respondent.?*°

The Komstroy Judgment is further irrelevant, the Claimant argues, because, while the
CJEU adopts an approach based on EU law, restricted to EU law, and limited to the
perspective of one of the many Contracting Parties to the ECT, the Tribunal must apply the
provisions of the ECT and the ICSID Convention. Unlike the CJEU, as an internal judge
of a Contracting Party to the ECT, an ECT tribunal is the competent authority to develop

an authoritative interpretation of the ECT.**! The Claimant repeats that it is evident that
under the provisions of the ECT and the ICSID Convention the Tribunal has jurisdiction.>*?

311 The Claimant adds that much like the Achmea Judgment, the Komstroy Judgment can in
any case not retroactively invalidate the Respondent’s unconditional consent to arbitration
given long before the date of the Achmea and Komstroy Judgments.>**

312 Furthermore, the Claimant points out that, while the CJEU appears to have deemed the seat
of an arbitration very relevant for its Achmea and Komstroy Judgments (Frankfurt and
Paris, respectively, in those cases), the present arbitration is not seated in the Eu.**4
According to the Claimant, the closed system of ICSID arbitration and enforcement
prevents the creation of a link to the EU and EU law in the present case. The Claimant
submits that the ICSID system is specifically designed to be isolated from the effects of
local interpretations.**°

313 Finally, the Claimant questions the correctness of the CJEU’s analysis in the Komstroy
Judgment, in view of the case law of ECT tribunals and given that, in its references to the
applicable law, the arbitration agreement that was relevant for the Achmea Judgment differs
considerably from Article 26(6) ECT.**°

i. The EU Member States Declarations

314 According to the Claimant, the EU Member States Declarations are of a political nature
and show strong differences of opinion within the EU about the applicability of the Achmea
judgment to the ECT.**’ The Claimant underlines that the Respondent and Luxembourg
signed different declarations.***

315 The Claimant argues that the 22 Member States Declaration cannot modify the content and
scope of the ECT, because in order to do so, the mechanisms set out in the ECT itself and
in general international law would have to be followed.” In that regard, the Claimant notes
that Article 46 ECT expressly prohibits reservations to the ECT, and that the amendment
procedure set out in Article 42 ECT has not been commenced.*? The Claimant further
argues that the 22 Member States Declaration does not constitute an agreement on the
interpretation of the ECT within the meaning of Article 31(3)(a) VCLT, nor subsequent
practice regarding its interpretation in the sense of Article 31(3)(b).*!

316 Finally, the Claimant submits that, even if the 22 Member States Declaration did amend
the ECT in any way, this would come too late for this arbitration, as according to Article
25(1) ICSID Convention, Spain cannot unilaterally withdraw its consent to arbitration after
it has given its consent, as it did, at the time of the Request on 22 July 2014.*#

j. Propriety of Issuing an Award

317 The Claimant submits that the Tribunal should assert its jurisdiction in order “not to violate
fundamental rights of the investors” because if eventually the CJEU or a national court
would rule in favour of compatibility of the ECT with intra-EU arbitration, but the Tribunal
would have declined jurisdiction, irreparable harm to the Claimant would have been caused
and its right to an effective remedy and fair trial would have been violated. The Claimant
notes that under Article 52 ICSID Convention, an ICSID award cannot be annulled for
being contrary to the EU legal order.*4?

4, The European Commission’s Submission

318 The EC submits that pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) VCLT and in line with, e.g., Electrabel
v. Hungary and Charanne v. Spain (but contra RREEF v. Spain), the Tribunal should
interpret Article 26 ECT in conformity with international law rules, among which EU
law.*“4 The EC further submits that it cannot be assumed lightly that the Respondent
entered into the ECT with the intention to accept obligations that are contrary to EU law.*4
The EC submits that, therefore, also in light of the Achmea Judgment, the Tribunal must
conclude that intra-EU disputes are not covered by the consent to arbitrate under Article
26 ECT.*6

319 According to the EC, this interpretation is confirmed by the wording of the ECT, in
particular by the provisions that envisage and deal with REIOs, such as Articles 1(2), 1(3),
1(10) and 36(7) ECT, and according to which, in the EC’s view, the territories of all EU
Member States that are Contracting Parties to the ECT fall under one and the same “Area”
in the sense of the ECT.**” According to the EC, this interpretation is further confirmed by
the practice of the EU Member States never to enter into inter se obligations in the
framework of multilateral treaties.*** The EC submits that the EU had negotiated the ECT
and that individual EU Member States had only become Contracting Parties to the ECT
because at the time of the conclusion of the ECT it was considered that EU Member States
would retain some competences relevant for the ECT. The EC adds that said competences
were, however, not retained and that it was never assumed that such competences would
regard the protection of investments.” According to the EC, the ECT is an external, not

an internal, energy policy project of the EU, not envisaged for EU-internal policy or
disputes and as such it falls under the exclusive external competence of the EU.*°® The EC
recalls its position that under EU law the Claimant enjoys “complete, strong and effective
protection of their investment”.**' According to the EC, the general principle of EU law of
mutual trust requires EU Member States to accord trust to their respective legal systems
and judicial institutions.**?

320 The EC argues that the lack of a disconnection clause is of no consequence for the
interpretation of Article 26 in the case of intra-EU disputes, in particular also because the
EU itself is a Contracting Party to the ECT.**

321 The EC submits that the ECT forms part of EU law because the EU is a Contracting Party
to it*4 The EC cites the principle set out in the CJEU’s judgment in the Western Sahara
case that provisions of international agreements entered into by the EU need to be in full
compliance with EU law.*°> The EC submits that, as it also follows from the Achmea
Judgment, intra-EU investment arbitration is precluded by the principle of autonomy of
EU law (Articles 19, 267 and 344 TFEU).3%°

322 The EC further submits that if the Tribunal deems it impossible to interpret Article 26 ECT
as excluding intra-EU investment disputes, the Tribunal would need to conduct a conflict
of laws analysis with the result that Article 26 ECT must not be applied in such disputes.>*”
According to the EC, the Tribunal could come to that result either based on (i) the primacy
of EU law and an a contrario reading of Article 351(1) TFEU or (ii) by considering the
suppression of inter se obligations of EU Member States under the ECT as an amendment
to a treaty by a later treaty only between certain parties thereto in the sense of Article
41(1)(b) VCLT, or by treating said suppression as /ex posterior in the sense of Article
30(4)(a) of the Vienna Convention.*** According to the EC, Article 16 ECT does not
change that result because it is a rule of interpretation, not of conflict. Furthermore, even
if it were a conflict rule, it would have been superseded by the later special conflict rule of
“primacy” and Article 351 TFEU a contrario. In any case, according to the EC, it is in the
EU Member States’ sovereign freedom to undo Article 16 ECT.*°

323 Finally, the EC submits that if the Tribunal has any doubts about those arguments, then it
should refer its questions to the CJEU by using a juge d’appui?

The EC further warns that if the Tribunal granted the Claimant a compensation, such an
award would effectively amount to an authorisation by the Tribunal of potentially unlawful
Spanish State aid to the Claimant. Doing so would ignore the EC’s exclusive competence
under EU law to authorise State aid.*°!

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal notes that the Intra-EU Objection in its current form in essence consists of
the following two-step argument:

(i) _ first, the Tribunal must apply EU law, and,

(ii) secondly, the consequence of applying EU law is that Article 26 ECT does not
apply in this dispute and did not apply at the time of the Request.

The Tribunal will deal with both parts of the argument in turn.

The Tribunal will then deal with the Respondent’s other line of argument on the Intra-EU
Objection, which the Respondent had emphasized more strongly before the Achmea
Judgment was rendered. In that line of argument, the Respondent had submitted that

(i) the Respondent’s and Luxembourg’s competences to deal with the issues
regulated under the ECT between each other have been fully absorbed in the single
membership of the EU in the ECT, and that,

(ii) as such, an arbitration between the Respondent and an investor from Luxembourg
is not, and cannot have been agreed to be, an arbitration between different
Contracting Parties in different “Areas” in the sense of the ECT.

Finally, the Tribunal will analyse whether, in light of potential issues with the enforcement
of an award, considerations of propriety and the Tribunal’s judicial function have, or should
have, an impact on its jurisdiction.

Applicability of EU Law and Consequences Thereof

Applicability of EU Law

(1) _ Possibility to Apply EU Law

As stated above, the Tribunal must first clarify whether (and, if so, to what extent), from
the perspective of an investment tribunal established on the basis of the ECT, EU law forms

part of the law to be applied by the tribunal.

The relevant parts of Article 26 ECT state in this regard:

361 EC’s Second Amicus Curiae Brief, {]135-141.

72

“(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating
to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an
obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period
of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement,
the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:

(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute;

(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or

(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.

 

(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its
unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation
in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

   

Ll

(6) A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance
with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.”

331 As regards the question of what is the law applicable to decisions on jurisdiction and,
consequently, whether, from the perspective of an investment tribunal established on the
basis of the ECT, EU law forms part of the applicable law, two interpretations of Article
26 ECT have been put forward.

332 The first approach, which is supported by the Respondent, relies on Article 26(6) ECT,
according to which a tribunal “shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this
Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law”. In case Article 26(6) ECT
applies to questions of jurisdiction, such rules and principles of international law would
also include EU law, including judgments of the CJEU,* inasmuch as it is based on
international treaties concluded between the EU Member States, i.e. the TEU as well as the
TFEU.*® In this regard, it deserves mention that the Achmea Judgment expressly
characterizes EU law as “deriving from an international agreement between the Member
States’ and that in the Komstroy Judgment, the CJEU concludes that because “the ECT

334

itself is an act of EU law”, “an arbitral tribunal such as that referred to in Article 26(6)
ECT is required to interpret, and even apply, EU law.”?°

The opposite view insists that, with respect to applicable law, a distinction must be made
between decisions on jurisdiction and decisions on the merits of a dispute. Accordingly,
the reference in Article 26(6) ECT to “the issues in dispute” only covers the decision on
the merits whereas the law applicable to decisions on jurisdiction is to be derived from
Article 26 ECT as a whole. Pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) ECT, dispute resolution by means
of investment arbitration is to be conducted “in accordance with the following paragraphs
of this Article”, notably paragraphs (4) and (5) in case of submission of the dispute to
ICSID.

In the context of the interpretation of the ICSID Convention, a similar controversy exists
in relation to Articles 25 and 42 of the Convention. According to Article 42(1) ICSID
Convention, “[t]he Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as
may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply
the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of
laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.” Some arbitral tribunals
have relied on this provision in deciding questions of jurisdiction and have thus also applied
other “rules of international law” Other tribunals have rejected this approach and stated
that the reference to “decid[ing] a dispute” in Article 42(1) ICSID Convention only covers
the decision on the merits, whereas questions of jurisdiction are to be decided exclusively

74

on the basis of Article 25 ICSID Convention as well as of the treaty provisions containing
the offer to consent to arbitration.°” The second view appears to be the prevailing one.**

335 The views on this issue adopted by arbitral tribunals deciding on ECT-based intra-EU
claims have been inconsistent. On the one hand, the Vattenfall v. Germany tribunal
confirmed the view that “the law applicable to the assessment of its jurisdiction is the ECT,
in particular Article 26 thereof, in conjunction with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention” >
On the other hand, other tribunals have not taken issue with applying Article 26(6) ECT in
regard to jurisdictional objections.*”

In the Tribunal’s view, much is to be said in favour of reading “issues in dispute” in Article
26(6) ECT only as issues concerning alleged breaches of the protections of Part III
(“Investment Promotion and Protection’), as does the tribunal in Vattenfall v. Germany”!
However, the Intra-EU Objection itself shows that jurisdiction can also be an issue in
dispute, and it is indeed when the conditions and criteria for jurisdiction have to be tested,
and met, that a tribunal may have to look further than just the instrument under which it is
constituted, and that it may require the guidance of a provision on the law to be applied.

Nevertheless, the debate is of limited relevance here, and the issue does not need to be
decided by the Tribunal, since both arguments miss the point.

This is because, first, no matter how one interprets Article 26(6) ECT, an analysis of its
own jurisdiction by a tribunal impanelled under the ECT would never take place in a
vacuum but rather in the international law setting into which the ECT was embedded from
its creation onwards. Hence, if a rule of international law existed that was relevant and
applicable, even though it was not mentioned in the ECT, it would likely be, and would
likely have to be, applied notwithstanding the respective interpretation of Article 26(6)
ECT (this idea is also expressed in Articles 31(2)(b) and 31(3)(c) VCLT, see below).
Similarly, if there were a successive, valid and binding, formal treaty that abolished parts
of the ECT, the Tribunal could not pretend that such a treaty did not exist.

Secondly, in the Tribunal’s view, Article 26(6) ECT is the wrong point of entry for an
argument of incompatibility. Article 26(6) ECT, as most governing law provisions, is not
a conflict rule (contrary to what the Claimant submits). The Article embodies a hierarchy
which starts, logically, with “this Treaty”, i.e. the ECT. The applicable rules and principles
of international law are then mentioned to allow a tribunal to supplement the Treaty where
necessary, not to contradict it. Thus, where the ECT is clear, Article 26(6) ECT does not
open a door to introduce a contradictory meaning through applicable rules and principles
of international law.

In addition, there exists a clear conflict rule in Article 16 ECT that shields the relevant Parts
Ill and V of the ECT from a conflict and would also stand in the way of interpreting
“applicable rules and principles” in a way that would render the clear text of the ECT
inapplicable (see below), especially when such allegedly “applicable rules and principles”
lack clarity and specificity.

In principle, Article 26(6) ECT may thus allow the Tribunal to apply rules of EU law in
this dispute where it deems it necessary, potentially even in its decision on jurisdiction. In
practice, however, no such application has been found to be necessary and the Tribunal
will elaborate on that conclusion below.

However, prior to that, the Tribunal wishes to take the opportunity of its analysis of Article
26(6) ECT to also refute the argument that because (principles of) EU law may play a role
in the analysis of the merits of this case and because the merits of the case (or indeed the
Tribunal’s Award in this case) might affect matters of EU law within the exclusive

31 Vattenfall v. Germany, 113-121.

346

jurisdiction of the CJEU or the EC, this Tribunal should decline jurisdiction. In the
Tribunal’s view, this argument fails. First, the Tribunal is not convinced that its decision
on the merits will have to touch upon such matters, not least because as an ECT tribunal,
the Tribunal will focus on violations of the ECT. Secondly, as shown above, Article 26(6)
ECT explicitly allows, or even mandates, the Tribunal not to desist from taking into
consideration other applicable rules of international law where it deems it necessary.

(2) No Need to Apply EU Law

The Tribunal has seen no need to also resort to EU law in the determination of its
jurisdiction for two reasons:

(i) First, on the basis of its text alone, the regime of Article 26 ECT and Article 25
ICSID Convention, i.e. the arbitration clause underlying this arbitration, is clear,
specific, and self-sufficient.

(ii) Secondly, the conditions for jurisdiction included in those two Articles have been
met as set out in the Claimant’s Memorial on the Merits: There is a dispute
between the Parties. The Respondent is a Contracting Party to the ECT in the sense
of Article 1(2) ECT. The Claimant is a national of another Contracting Party to
the ECT. The Claimant is an Investor in the sense of Article 1(7) ECT. The
investments of the Claimant are, in their entirety or in part, Investments in the
sense of Article 1(6) ECT and the dispute relates to them. The investments lie in
the Area of the Respondent in the sense of Article 1(10) ECT. The Claimant
alleges violations by the Respondent of Part III of the ECT. The Claimant has
made an attempt for amicable settlement and more than three months have elapsed
between this attempt and the Request. There is no evidence that the dispute was
submitted to the courts of the Respondent or that any other applicable, previously
agreed dispute settlement procedure was applied, and, finally, the Claimant has
provided ICSID with its written consent to arbitration?”

In addition, no other reasons were presented, or are imaginable, that could raise suspicion
in the mind of the Tribunal that the regime of Article 26 ECT and Article 25 ICSID
Convention was insufficient, invalid, or in any need of supplementation at any relevant
point in time.

In that regard, the Tribunal notes that no subsequent agreement exists regarding the
interpretation of Article 26 ECT that would cast Article 26 ECT’s clarity, sufficiency, or
validity into doubt, nor does any subsequent practice to that effect exist.

The Tribunal furthermore notes that, as the Claimant rightly points out, the Respondent and
Luxembourg had the competence to enter into the ECT in its current form and neither State
has made any reservations to the ECT, nor could they have. Contrary to some arguments
of the Respondent, Articles 26 ECT and 25 ICSID Convention have neither been
suspended, in the sense of Article 58 VCLT, nor amended within the framework and in

322 See MoM, {{H1104 1-1089.

77

347

348

349

350

351

352

353

accordance with the procedures set out in the ECT, nor by any other procedure either
between the Respondent and Luxembourg or between all, or at least some, of the parties to
both Treaties.

In that regard, the Tribunal, finally, also notes that the political declarations on the
interpretation of the Achmea Judgment that Luxembourg and the Respondent have signed,
differed as to the effect they attach to the Achmea Judgment vis-a-vis intra-EU investment
arbitration under the ECT, with Luxembourg declining to express a view regarding the
compatibility of the intra-EU application of the ECT with EU law.*”

With a view to the arguments of amendment, suspension, or regarding the alleged effects
of the EU Member States Declarations, the Tribunal further adds and recalls that even if
suspension or amendment was the argued effect of either the EU Member States
Declarations or the Achmea and Komstroy Judgments, any such effect would come too late
in this case to affect or invalidate the consent perfected by the Parties at the relevant time,
i.e. the date of the Request.

Therefore, the Tribunal, when analysing and determining its jurisdiction, does not see a
reason to doubt the validity, clarity, and sufficiency of Articles 26 ECT and 25 ICSID
Convention and thus does not see a reason to look further than the unambiguous arbitration
clause under which it is constituted.

The Tribunal therefore finds that, while it may apply EU law where it deems it applicable
and necessary, as outlined above, the application and analysis of EU law is not required for
the Tribunal’s determination of its jurisdiction in the case before it. The Respondent’s main
argument on the Intra-EU Objection thus fails on its basic premise: i.e. that the Tribunal
must apply EU law when determining its jurisdiction.

Nevertheless, for completeness’ sake, the Tribunal will now turn to the second prong of the
Respondent’s argument and consider what the Tribunal would have to do if it had to
consider and apply EU law also in its decision on its jurisdiction.

Consequences of Applying EU Law

To that end, the Tribunal finds it helpful to, first, take this opportunity to explain its
understanding of EU law as expressed in the Achmea and Komstroy Judgments, followed,
secondly, by an analysis of whether there are any relevant points of contact between the
EU legal order and the ECT legal order, and, finally, by a discussion of how the Tribunal
would deal with a conflict between applicable rules of both orders if such a conflict arose.

It is not for this Tribunal to determine with certainty what the CJEU meant where its
findings are not entirely clear, or to seek to determine the EU-internal consequences of the

373 See the 22 Member States Declaration (C-0851) and the Five Member States Declaration (C-0852), p. 3. The

Tribunal is of course aware that, in view of the content of the Five Member States Declaration, thi

intra-EU investment arbitration under the ECT.

78

CJEU’s findings. Nevertheless, the Tribunal in the course of these proceedings had to
establish its reading of the Achmea Judgment in order to properly resolve the Intra-EU
Objection.

354 — In doing so, the Tribunal came to the following conclusion:

355 Given that, under the ECT, EU Member States undertake to accept the jurisdiction of an
arbitral tribunal in the case of claims by individuals from other EU Member States, and
given that that arbitral tribunal

(i) is not a court in the sense of the EU Treaties,
(ii) cannot request a preliminary ruling from the CJEU and
(iii) its decisions are removed from review by national courts of the EU,

the Tribunal found it appropriate to base its analysis on the assumption that the Achmea
Judgment means that, from an EU-internal point of view, the arbitration clause of the ECT
is incompatible with the “principle of sincere cooperation” embodied in Article 4(3)
TEU,*” and, as a consequence, Articles 267 and 344 TFEU “preclude” the clause. In the
Tribunal’s view, the Komstroy Judgment, which appears to structure its argument exactly
along these lines, confirms this interpretation.

356 In the Tribunal’s view, the Achmea and Komstroy Judgments thus mean that from an
internal EU law perspective, EU Member States should not have entered into the ECT in
its current form and may even mean that EU Member States should try to amend their
obligations thereunder (an interpretation of the necessary process that also finds an
expression in the existence and content of the EU Member States Declarations). However,
it is doubtful to this Tribunal whether, in such a scenario, the Achmea or Komstroy
Judgment, from an internal EU law perspective, could mean that the obligations of EU
Member States under the ECT are void, invalidated, or could not have been validly entered
into, as the Respondent seems to argue. It is furthermore uncertain whether the CJEU
assumes that its judgments do have, or could have, such an effect. 315

357 Therefore, it is not apparent whether EU law, as interpreted by the Achmea and Komstroy
Judgments, from an EU-internal point of view, has the legal consequences for an ECT
Tribunal that the Respondent attributes to it.

374 Achmea Judgment, {58 in conjunction with 434.

575 Interestingly, the EC has summarised the situation for arbitration clauses in intra-EU bilateral investment treaties
as follows jowever, those provisions in bilateral investment treaties are not part of Union law. Hence the Court of
Justice lacks the power to annul them. National courts and tribunals have to leave those provisions unapplied (general
principle of primacy of Union law). They remain nevertheless, formally part of the national legal order and the
international legal order. Member States, as a matter of Union law, have an obligation to immediately terminate them,
in order to ensure legal certainty.” EC’s Second Amicus Curiae Brief, 427; see also EC’s First Amicus Curiae Brief,
q168f., 81-84, 96-117, where the EC seems to argue mostly in terms of a potential violation of EU law by an intra-EU
offer to arbitrate under the ECT rather than in terms of inapplicability.

363

In any case, even assuming that those judgments, from an EU-law perspective, did purport
to directly void or rewrite a clause in an international agreement of one of its Member
States, the question that is relevant for this Tribunal is not one of EU-internal law. The
question that is relevant for this Tribunal is whether, from the viewpoint of the ECT, i.e.
the perspective that matters to this Tribunal, in a decision on jurisdiction under the ECT,
there are points of contact with EU law through which the EU-internal reading of the law
and the ECT could become relevant to this ECT Tribunal.

The Tribunal has found no such points of contact relevant to its decision on jurisdiction.
The ECT, which prohibits reservations and provides for a closed system of withdrawal and
amendments (see above) is, as a matter of principle, ignorant of, and unaffected by,
judgments and evolving legal interpretations in another legal order such as the EU, as well
as in national legal orders, no matter how forcefully those orders argue their applicability.
Furthermore, any potential breach of internal or EU law committed by entering into the
ECT could not have been sufficiently evident at the time of the conclusion of the ECT to
call into question the EU Member States’ consent to Article 26 ECT in its current form or
to be relevant in any other form, not least in light of the ECT’s travaux préparatoires and
the lack of a disconnection clause in the ECT (see below).>”°

Therefore, from the perspective of international law, the Achmea and Komstroy Judgments
cannot mean that the obligations of EU Member States under the ECT are void, invalidated,
or could not have been validly entered into, even if performing them would violate EU law.
In addition, from that same perspective, a judgment of the CJEU cannot direct a tribunal
impanelled under the ECT to “/eave unapplied” the arbitration clause under which it is
constituted.

In light of the above, from the perspective of this Tribunal, independent of whatever the
CJEU intended to cover with the Achmea and Komstroy Judgments, there can thus be no
direct conflict of laws (i.e. a situation in which the Tribunal has to choose between two
contradicting applicable rules) between EU law and the ECT as regards Article 26 ECT,
unless the Tribunal were to apply EU law to its decision on jurisdiction and considered
itself subject to EU law. However, as the Tribunal has determined above, it will not and
does not have to apply EU law to that decision and it is not subject to EU law.

Nevertheless, for completeness’ sake, the Tribunal will now entertain the hypothetical
scenario of how to resolve a conflict of applicable provisions of the ECT and EU law in
case there was a conflict. The Tribunal’s findings on this hypothetical scenario reflect the
view of the majority, with Arbitrator Sands not finding it necessary to address the
hypothetical.

Resolution of a Conflict of Laws

In the hypothetical case of a conflict between provisions of the ECT and EU law relevant
to this Tribunal and this case, the Tribunal could either seek to interpret one treaty in

376 See also the argument on the EC’s submission in the Electrabel v. Hungary case, CMoJ, (18 If.

80

harmony with the provisions of the other, as is demanded by the Respondent and supported
by the submissions of the EC and the Komstroy Judgment, or, if that was impossible, the
Tribunal would have to identify and apply the applicable conflict rule.

364 The Tribunal will therefore turn to these two options now, starting with the possibility of
harmonious interpretation.

(1) Harmonious Interpretation

365 Unlike the Respondent, the EC, and the CJEU, the Tribunal is not convinced that an alleged
conflict between EU law and Article 26 ECT can be resolved by harmonious interpretation.
In the view of the Tribunal, Article 26 ECT is too clear and self-sufficient in its meaning
to require, or even allow for, further non-textual interpretation. The position of EU law on
the other hand, while having become substantially clearer due to the Komstroy Judgment,
can still not be determined exactly and is subject to ongoing developments.

366 It is generally accepted that the ECT, and notably its Article 26, must be interpreted in
accordance with Articles 31 to 33 VCLT.°”’ The general rule of interpretation in Article
31(1) VCLT is that “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms in their context and in the light of its object and
purpose”.

367 Throughout the proceedings, the Claimant has consistently opposed the argument that the
proper and harmonious interpretation of Article 26 ECT (together with other provisions of
the ECT or stand-alone) would lead to the exclusion of intra-EU claims from ECT dispute
settlement, since plainly no such restriction exists in the language of the ECT. In a similar
vein, numerous arbitral tribunals have unanimously stated that such a carve-out or
disconnection clause with regard to intra-EU claims could not be implicit, but would have
to be express and clear.?”8

368 The Tribunal endorses this position. Prior to the conclusion of the ECT, the EU had been
aware of, and had actually used express disconnection clauses as a means to ensure that
provisions of a mixed agreement would not apply between EU Member States.*”?
Furthermore, as opposed to the intra-EU scenario on which the ECT is silent, the ECT
explicitly limits its application in certain specific situations, notably with respect to the
Svalbard Treaty**° as well as in Article 28 ECT. Moreover, the EU had proposed the

prevail to the extent of the conflict, without prejudice to the positions of the Contracting Parties in respect of the
Svalbard Treaty. In the event of such conflict or a dispute as to whether there is such conflict or as to its extent, Article

insertion of a disconnection clause during the negotiations of the ECT, but the clause was
ultimately dropped from the draft treaty.**!

In addition, the Tribunal is not convinced that Article 31(3)(c) VCLT — according to which
“any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties”
shall be taken into account, together with the context — can be relied upon to “carve out”
intra-EU claims from the scope of Article 26 ECT, as suggested by the Respondent as well
as the EC. Article 31(3)(c) VCLT is not to be applied in isolation, but as an integral part of
the general rule of interpretation enshrined in Article 31(1) VCLT. The Tribunal agrees
that the role of this provision in the exercise of treaty interpretation cannot be to introduce
external elements into a treaty with the effect of rewriting the treaty altogether.**”

As has been shown before, neither the ordinary meaning of the terms used by the ECT, nor
the systematic analysis of its provisions, offer a basis for the Tribunal to conclude that the
ECT is to be construed as removing intra-EU claims from ECT dispute settlement.
Assigning to Article 31(3)(c) VCLT the role of completely reversing this assessment in the
name of “harmonious” treaty interpretation or “systemic integration” would put too much
burden on this provision which calls on the Tribunal to “take into account” relevant
provisions of international law together with the other factors referred to in Article 31(1)
VCLT, and not to substitute the former for the latter.

Moreover, inasmuch as the Respondent contends that the 22 Member States Declaration
reflects a subsequent agreement regarding the interpretation of the ECT within the meaning
of Article 31(3)(a) VCLT and, subsidiarily, that it constitutes, for the purposes of Article
31(3)(b) VCLT, subsequent practice in the application of the ECT establishing agreement
of the Parties regarding its interpretation, the Tribunal has similar reservations, not least in
view of the fact that the Respondent and Luxembourg have signed different declarations
(see above). To be sure, the 22 Member States Declaration as well as the two further
declarations were adopted by the remaining EU Member States, may have some
interpretative value, especially after the Komstroy Judgment, which appears to have
significantly reduced the differences between the Five Member States Declaration and the
22 Member States Declaration. Yet, being non-binding instruments and not reflecting a
consensus of all EU Member States — let alone, and more importantly, all ECT Contracting
Parties — the EU Member States Declarations cannot change the clear terms of the ECT or
guide the Tribunal in seeking a harmonious interpretation.

Finally, while having entertained the possibility of a harmonious interpretation for the sake
of argument, the Tribunal expresses its serious doubts that even if it came to a situation
where a harmonious interpretation might be an option, the Tribunal, as a Tribunal under
the ECT, would be obliged to seek an interpretation of the ECT harmonious with EU law
and not, if at all, the other way round. This, not least, in light of the ECT’s Article 16,

16 and Part V of the Energy Charter Treaty shall not apply.” See PV Investors v. Spain I, 183; Eiser v. Spain, 4187;
Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v. Kingdom of Spain, \CSID Case No. ARB/14/1, Award, 16 May 2018 (CL-
0280) (“Masdar v. Spain”), 4311; Vattenfall v. Germany, 204; Greentech v. Italy, 1343.

375

376

377

which expressly prohibits interpretations that would deviate from, or undermine, certain
core provisions and protections of the ECT, including the right to dispute resolution (as
discussed below).

The Tribunal therefore concludes that, if there were a conflict between EU law and
provisions of the ECT, in particular its Article 26 ECT, a harmonious interpretation, even
if allowed and desirable, would not function and thus could not be applied.

(2) Potential Conflict Rules

The Tribunal will now turn to the identification and application of potential conflict rules.
It will start with Article 16 ECT, which it deems the relevant and applicable norm, and will
then deal with, and dismiss, other potential norms on which the Respondent has sought to
rely.

(a) Article 16 ECT

Article 16 ECT, titled “Relation to Other Agreements”, prescribes that if two Contracting
Parties to the ECT have entered into a prior, or enter into a subsequent, international
agreement that concerns the subject matter of Part II] ECT (“Investment Promotion and
Protection”) or Part V ECT (“Dispute Settlement’), “nothing” in the terms of the other
agreement “shall be construed to derogate from any provision of Part III or V of {the ECT]
or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under [the ECT], where any
such provision is more favourable to the Investor or Investment.”

In view of its terms, e.g. the reference to “construe”, Article 16 ECT may at first sight
appear to represent a rule of interpretation rather than a conflict rule. The Claimant, and
also many arbitral tribunals,°*? however, have considered Article 16 ECT to work as a
conflict rule governing a situation where provisions of two treaties are not compatible with
each other. After careful analysis, the present Tribunal shares this view. The Tribunal is of
the opinion that Article 16 ECT’s clear wording in absolute terms (e.g. using terms such as
“nothing”) shows that it was intended as an insurmountable protection of certain core
principles and rights within the ECT in case of a conflict with any other agreement.

Article 16 ECT’s protections apply in this case if

(i) the EU Treaties are prior or subsequent international agreements that “concern”
Part III ECT or Part V ECT,

(ii) provisions of the EU Treaties (as interpreted by the Achmea and Komstroy
Judgment) aim to derogate from provisions of Part III of V of the ECT, or from
any right to dispute resolution, and

383 See Vattenfall v. Germany, {{217, 223, 229; Greentech v. Italy, 4341.

83

(iii) the provisions which might otherwise be subject to derogation are more favourable
to the Investor or the Investment than those in the derogating treaty.

378 Regarding the first and second condition, the Tribunal notes that it would seem that the EU
Treaties, in the interpretation given to them by the Respondent and the Komstroy Judgment,
“concern” the subject matter of Part III and in any case Part V of the ECT. It would further
seem that, according to that interpretation, the EU Treaties in fact aim to derogate from at
least Part V of the ECT, in particular from Article 26 ECT, and the right to dispute
resolution contained therein. The above-mentioned first and second condition are therefore
met.

379 The Tribunal furthermore notes that, based on its wording, Article 16 ECT operates
irrespectively of the question of timing, as it applies to both prior and subsequent
international agreements relating to Part III (“Investment Promotion and Protection”) or
Part V (“Dispute Settlement”) of the ECT. Accordingly, the issue of whether the ECT is
the earlier or the later legal instrument vis-a-vis the EU Treaties, which is of relevance with
respect to Article 30 VCLT (see below), does not affect the application of the /ex specialis
of Article 16 ECT.

380 In light of the above, the effect of Article 16 ECT essentially depends on the fulfilment of
the third condition, i.e. whether the substantive and procedural guarantees of either Part
III/V ECT or of EU law are more favourable to EU investors and investments. The Parties
have taken conflicting positions on this question: On the one hand, the Respondent argues
that EU law creates a more comprehensive and better system of intra-EU protection of
investments than the ECT. On the other hand, the Claimant contends that as EU law does
not provide an investor with the right to file a claim before an independent tribunal outside
the forum state, the ECT offers the more favourable rule for the investor.

381 Arbitral practice on the subject*** has affirmed that Article 26 ECT is at least in some
aspects more favourable to investors and investments than EU law, thus preventing a
reading of Article 16 ECT that would restrict EU investors’ rights to dispute resolution
under the ECT.**° In particular, the Masdar v. Spain tribunal has found that

“Article 16 ECT affords di to the more fi investor: ion provisions of
Article 26 ECT of which Claimant has availed itself over any conflicting provision of the EU
treaties. They are more favourable, not least, because they obviate the need to bring the claim in
the Spanish courts and Respondent cannot derogate from Article 26, pursuant to which it has
given unconditional consent to arbitration.”>°°

 

384 See Plama Consortium Lid. v. Republic of Bulgaria, \CSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction,
8 February 2005 (CL-0179/RL-0025), 141; Eiser v. Spain, [202; Masdar v. Spain, 332; Vattenfall v. Germany,
4194; Greentech v. Italy, $9340F.

385 See RREEF v. Spain I, {§{75, 87; Vattenfall v. Germany, 4196: “[...] Article 16 [ECT] confirms beyond doubt that
Respondent’s proposed reading of the provisions of the ECT is untenable. In light of this provision it is not possible
to ‘read into’ Article 26 [ECT] an interpretation whereby certain investors would be depri irri

resolution, whether against an EU Member State or otherwise.”; see further ibid., (229: “[...] Article 16 [ECT] poses
an insurmountable obstacle to Respondent’s argument that EU law prevails over the ECT”.

84

382

383

384

385

386

387

The Tribunal embraces this statement and thus concludes that at least some of the
provisions of Part III and Part V of the ECT are more favourable to investors and
investments with respect to ECT intra-EU claims. As a consequence, from the perspective
of the ECT which the Tribunal must primarily apply, the provisions of the ECT, notably
its Article 26, prevail over those of EU law. That this potential collision of norms may have
to be handled differently from the point of view of EU law, does not change this
assessment.

If the Tribunal thus had to resolve a conflict of laws regarding its jurisdiction, Article 16
ECT would decide that conflict in favour of Article 26 ECT. In light thereof, the
Respondent’s main argument regarding its Intra-EU Objection, even if it reached the stage
of a conflict of laws analysis, would have to fail.

Having so concluded, the Tribunal will now turn to alternative arguments raised by the
Respondent as to how EU law could prevail over the provisions of the ECT.

(b) Article 30 and 59 VCLT

According to the Respondent, the EU Treaties, in the form of the Treaty of Lisbon, which
is of a later date than the date of conclusion of the ECT, not only share but also exceed the
object and purpose of the ECT and as such are later treaties on the same subject-matter in
the sense of Articles 30 and 59 VCLT. That means, according to the Respondent, that they
supersede the ECT as leges posteriores in the sense of Article 30 VCLT or even have the
character of an implied termination or suspension by conclusion of a later treaty in the
sense of Article 59 VCLT.

(i) Article 30 VCLT

The first provision for the Tribunal to consider in this regard is Article 30 VWCLT which
deals with the “Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter” and
to which the Parties have also referred in their submissions.

According to Article 30(3) VCLT, in case of successive treaties relating to the same
subject-matter, “[w]hen all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later
treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59,
the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of
the later treaty”. Pursuant to Article 30(4) VCLT, the rule that the later treaty prevails (lex
posterior derogat legi priori) also governs situations where the parties to the earlier and
later treaties do not coincide, but its effect is then limited to the States which are parties to
both treaties. This is the relevant scenario in the present context, as the relationship of the
ECT on the one hand and the EU Treaties on the other is under scrutiny.

85

388

389

390

391

392

393

However, in order for Article 30 VCLT to apply, the treaties in question must regulate the
“same subject-matter”. As far as the ECT and the EU Treaties are concerned, according to
numerous arbitral tribunals, this requirement is not met.387

In addition, with respect to the concept of “successive treaties”, there are different views
as to whether the ECT or the EU Treaties qualify as the earlier or later treaties within the
meaning of Article 30 VCLT. The ECT was adopted in 1994 and entered into force in
1998. While it is true that Articles 267 and 344 TFEU, which are the critical provisions of
EU law from the point of view of the Achmea and the Komstroy Judgment, form part of
the TFEU which was introduced by the 2007 Treaty of Lisbon (which entered into force in
2009), these provisions have existed in substantively similar form since the 1957 Treaty of
Rome establishing the European Economic Community (Articles 177 and 219 EEC
Treaty), in force since 1 January 1958288

The Tribunal need not take a stand on these questions. The VCLT, which embodies general
rules on treaty interpretation in its Article 30(2), specifically makes way for special
agreements, i.e. leges speciales, to deviate from the general norms set out therein.
According to Article 30(2) VCLT, “[w]hen a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it
is not to be considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of
that other treaty prevail”.

As highlighted and discussed above, Article 16 ECT is lex specialis vis-a-vis Article 30
VCLT. Therefore, even if the EU Treaties and the ECT were “successive treaties relating
to the same subject-matter”, an issue which, in light of the above, does not need to be
decided by the Tribunal, the Tribunal would still never reach Article 30(3) VCLT in its
analysis.

Therefore, the Tribunal finds that even if the EU Treaties were leges posteriores to the
ECT, and even if they prohibited intra-EU investor-State arbitration, Article 16 ECT, as
lex specialis, would trump the considerations of posteriority. Thus, absent any explicit
amendments thereto, in determining the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, the relevant
provisions of the ECT prevail over any of the implied or explicit provisions of the EU
Treaties.

(ii) Article 59 VCLT
The second provision to consider for the Tribunal in this regard is Article 59 VCLT which

deals with the “termination or suspension of a treaty implied by conclusion of a later
treaty”.

387 See Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic, (159-166; Electrabel v. Hungary II, 14.176; Vattenfall v. Germany, 11194,

The Tribunal can be quick in dismissing any arguments based on this Article. Even
independent of the above analysis of the role of Article 16 ECT and Article 30 VCLT, the
Tribunal cannot help but notice that no proper argument has been made, among other
things, why (i) the Tribunal should apply Article 59 VCLT by analogy even though not all
Contracting Parties to the ECT are EU Member States, and (ii) why it should do so only
with a view to Article 26 ECT, and only with a view to certain Contracting Parties among
each other, even though the Article seems to deal with termination or suspension of treaties
as a whole. It has also not been presented as probable, let alone been established as fact,
that the relevant Contracting Parties to the ECT indeed intend, or intended at any point in
time, to terminate or suspend the ECT in part or in full, and intended that such a termination
or suspension should not take place through the proper channels set out in the ECT itself.

Therefore, the Tribunal is not convinced that Article 59 VCLT has any bearing on the
situation at hand, nor that it would have the effect that the Respondent seems to imply and
hope it to have.

(c) Primacy of EU Law
The Tribunal then turns to the Respondent’s main “conflict of laws” argument.

According to the Respondent, the principle of primacy of EU law is not only an
interpretative criterion, but also a special conflict rule, which takes precedence over the
general rules of conflict as reflected in Article 30(3) to (5) VCLT. In addition, according
to the Respondent, the principle of primacy of EU law is also lex posterior to the ECT
because it was codified in the Treaty of Lisbon, after the conclusion of the ECT.

The Tribunal cannot follow this argument for several reasons. Even independent of an
answer to the question whether the principle of primacy of EU law is lex posterior to the
ECT even though it existed before the ECT (with the Respondent itself relating it back to
the Van Gend and Loos Judgment),**” the Tribunal is not necessarily convinced, and did
not hear sufficient argument to the effect, that the principle was ever intended to have a
reach, or could have a reach, broader than the resolution of conflicts between EU law and
the law of EU Member States. Indeed, the Tribunal cannot help but note that the very
declaration, which according to the Respondent has codified the principle of supremacy,
states:

“17. Declaration concerning primacy

The Conference recalls that, in accordance with well settled case law of the Court of Justice of
the European Union, the Treaties and the law adopted by the Union on the basis of the Treaties

38 E.g. RC on BayWa, 167; CJEU, Judgment of 5 February 1963 in Van Gend & Loos v. Nederlandse administratie
der belastingen, Case C-26/62 (RL-0161).

399

400

401

402

have primacy over the law of Member States, under the conditions laid down by the said case
wo

The text of this “codifying” declaration is thus focussed on establishing supremacy of EU
law over the law of EU Member States. This is a far cry from establishing supremacy over
the obligations in another treaty belonging to another international legal order. This holds
true with special force in view of the fact that the EU itself is a party to the ECT and that
both the Respondent and the European Commission took the view that, from an internal
EU perspective, the ECT forms part of EU law — in other words, on the Respondent’s own
case, as supported by the European Commission, any collision between the EU Treaties
and the ECT would be a conflict between different instruments of EU law, not between EU
law and the law of EU Member States. The Tribunal is thus not convinced that the principle
of primacy is the kind of conflict rule that the Respondent has argued it to be.

In that regard, the Tribunal notes, that contrary to what the Respondent has argued, Article
25 ECT does not express any form of primacy of EU law within the ECT. Article 25 ECT
is a standard provision that allows for two-speed integration by exempting “Economic
Integration Agreements” from most-favoured-nation obligations. It has nothing to do with
the alleged primacy of EU law and nothing to do with Article 26 ECT.

Regarding the applicability of the principle of primacy, the Tribunal is furthermore not
convinced of any arguments that the ECT forms part of EU law because the EU is a
Contracting Party to it, to the extent that this argument is intended to mean that the simple
fact of the EU being a Contracting Party to the ECT would import the ECT into the
hierarchy of EU law on a level below the EU Treaties. As a matter of course, once the EU
entered into the ECT, its obligations thereunder are obligations of the EU and to that extent
form part of EU law. However, the Tribunal notes that this view is just the EU-internal
view on its ECT obligations. From an international law perspective, i.e. the perspective of
the ECT, with its Contracting Parties from all over the world, the EU status as Contracting
Party does nothing to the position of the ECT in the hierarchy of norms between different
international treaties and regimes.

That being said, even if the principle of primacy were the rule of conflict that the
Respondent desired it to be, and even if it was /ex posterior, for this Tribunal impanelled
under the ECT it would still stand in competition with the very clear and specific terms of
the ECT conflict rule of Article 16 ECT, as discussed above. In that competition between
different treaties and international legal orders, this Tribunal, being an ECT Tribunal,
would then have to give precedence to Article 16 ECT, which in its clear terms protects
certain provisions and principles of the ECT even from later treaties. This would ever so
much more have to be the conclusion because while, on the one hand, Article 16 ECT
embodies a clear and specific, written, agreement on this particular subject, the principle
of supremacy, on the other hand, could at best be considered a vague catch-all provision,

which would have to be interpreted as having been implied (rather than expressly agreed)
into the ECT by only some of the Contracting Parties.

Therefore, the Tribunal sees no reason why the principle of primacy under EU law should
change its conclusion regarding the meaning of Article 16 ECT as it has stated it above.

The Respondent and Luxembourg as “other Contracting Parties” vis-a-vis Each
Other

The Tribunal then turns to a line of argument regarding the Intra-EU Objection on which
the Respondent had placed more emphasis before the Achmea Judgment was rendered.

According to the Respondent, within the EU, the objects and subjects that the ECT deals
with and aims to achieve fall under the sole competence of the EU. The EU Member States
had transferred those competences to the EU already before entering into the ECT.
According to the Respondent, that has two consequences:

(i) First, for ECT-related issues and conflicts within the EU, all EU Member States
must be deemed to be one Contracting Party consisting of one single “Area” as
reflected in the status of the EU as Contracting Party, and the many Articles of the
ECT that contain provisions for REIOs.

(ii) Secondly, the EU Member States could not have agreed to intra-EU dispute
resolution under the ECT because at the time of the conclusion of the ECT they
did not have the competence to commit to such dispute resolution as that
competence had already been transferred to the EU.

The Tribunal cannot follow either prong of this argument.

As regards the first prong, the Tribunal notes that it is correct that the ECT does provide
for the membership of international organisations and the text of the ECT is structured in
that way. However, nothing in Articles 26(1), 1(2), 1(3), 1(10), or 36(7) ECT can lead the
Tribunal to interpret these provisions in a way other than following the clear meaning of
their text: these Articles, in short, show that a REIO can be a Contracting Party to the ECT.
Tf there is a conflict between an Investor and a Contracting Party that is a REIO, the Area
in the sense of Article 26(1) ECT is the totality of the Areas of the member states of that
REIO, and if there is a conflict between an Investor and a State that is a Contracting Party,
as is the case here, the Area in the sense of Article 26(1) ECT is the Area of that State. This
part of the Respondent’s argument thus fails.

As regards the second prong of the argument, the Tribunal finds it equally unconvincing.
Without needing to delve too deeply into the matter, the basic premise of the argument, i.e.
that EU Member States had transferred all intra-EU competence on matters of energy as
regulated in the ECT to the EU seems doubtful to the Tribunal, not least in light of the
wording of Article 4(2)(i) TFEU, as the Claimant rightly points out.

89

409

410

411

412

413

414

The Tribunal has furthermore not heard any convincing argument on the question of how,
even if the two States had already transferred their competences on energy policy and
dispute resolution, as the Respondent argues, this circumstance would lead to anything but
an internal conflict of obligations under different treaties as discussed and resolved above.

Finally, the Respondent’s argument cannot succeed in light of the travaux préparatoires of
the ECT and, in particular, the EU’s failed attempt to include a disconnection clause into
the ECT — an aspect of the case which has been discussed in detail by the Parties and above
in this Award. The EU had deemed a disconnection clause necessary to avoid an intra-EU
effect of (certain parts of) the ECT, but such a clause was not included into the final draft
of the ECT.

Therefore, the Respondent’s other line of argument on the Intra-EU Objection must equally
fail.

Propriety of Issuing an Award

The Claimant has also submitted that pending further decisions of the CJEU on the exact
meaning of the Achmea Judgment and further political developments, the Tribunal should
assert its jurisdiction in order “not to violate fundamental rights of the investors”, and in
order not to deny it the right to an effective remedy. In addition, the Claimant has pointed
out that any award by this Tribunal as an award of an ICSID Tribunal would not be subject
to annulment for violation of the EU legal order.

The Tribunal notes that while neither the ICSID Convention nor the ECT contain a rule
analogous to Article 42 of the ICC Rules**', according to which arbitral tribunals “shall
make every effort to make sure that the award is enforceable at law”, the question may be
asked in the present context whether serious problems to be expected in the enforceability
of the award rendered should prompt an arbitral tribunal to refrain from exercising its
jurisdiction in order to preserve the integrity of the arbitral function.*”

In this regard, the Tribunal notes the argument of the Micula v. Romania tribunal which
found that

 

“it is not desirable to embark on predictions as to the possible conduct of various persons and
authorities after the Award has been rendered, especially but not exclusively when it comes to
enforcement matters. It is thus inappropriate for the Tribunal to base its decisions in this case on
matters of EU law that may come to apply after the Award has been rendered. It will thus not
address the Parties’ and the Commission’s arguments on enforceability of the Award [...]. That
being said, he Tribunal notes that Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention [...] apply in any
event to this Award.

This was confirmed by the Eskosol v. Italy tribunal which found:

“(T]he Tribunal rejects Italy’s contention that any award it may render (in either Party’s favour)
necessarily would be unenforceable. [...] In these circumstances, a tribunal finding that it has
jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the ECT should not decline to exercise that
jurisdiction, simply because there are certain scenarios under which one or the other Party might
face challenges in enforcement in certain jurisdictions, based on their national laws and/or their
other treaty obligations. The Tribunal has a duty to exercise the jurisdiction it has found to exist,
and will proceed to do so with respect to the issues remaining in this case.”3°

 

The Tribunal agrees. While it may be expected that questions of enforceability will arise
before EU Member States’ domestic courts, and while the answers to such questions by
EU domestic courts could appear uncertain in light of the above, the Tribunal feels duty-
bound to issue an Award on the merits, to the extent that it has jurisdiction on the claims
submitted to it. In the view of the Tribunal, Articles 53 and 54 ICSID Convention deal with
post-award issues conclusively and sufficiently safeguard the enforceability of an award.

Accordingly, the Tribunal sees no reason to refrain from exercising its jurisdiction.
Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s Intra-EU Objection.
Objection B

The Respondent’s Principal Arguments

The Respondent’s jurisdictional objection B has undergone some permutations. The
Respondent’s Reply on Preliminary Objections (“RoPO”), of 24 February 2017, partly
withdraws Preliminary Objection A in the Respondent’s Memorial on Preliminary
Objections (“MoPO”), but re-establishes parts of Preliminary Objections A and E as
Preliminary Objection B.** In its revised form, Preliminary Objection B addresses the
Tribunal’s power to hear the Claimant’s claim in relation to certain assets, namely
“returns”, “rights conferred by law or contract’, and “interests”. According to the
Respondent, the only damage that the Claimant can claim is the loss of value of its indirect
participation in the capital of the SPVs caused by the Disputed Measures. This would not
include a percentage of the future dividends allegedly lost, since there exists a group of
companies between the Claimant and the SPVs which would affect the flow-through of the
yields produced by these plants.*°°

For the Respondent, the Claimant’s investment consisted exclusively of the indirect interest
in the capital and subordinated loans of the holding companies of the Wind Farms and CSP
Plants.*°’ The Respondent submits that the Claimant neither owned nor directly or

426

indirectly controlled the Wind Farms or CSP Plants, their returns, their rights or their
contracts. The Claimant merely owned equity stakes in the SPVs, which in turn own the
plants, their returns and other rights. Therefore, the Claimant cannot directly claim the
damage suffered by the SPVs.*°*

The Respondent relies on ST-AD v. Bulgaria,*”? Postova banka v. Hellenic Republic,”
RREEF vy. Spain, and Nykomb v. Latvia‘®! for the proposition that an investor has no
enforceable right over the assets of a company in which it owns shares, and that a tribunal’s
jurisdiction extends only to the loss of value of the shares or participation in the capital.4°?

The Respondent also relies on Article 25 ICSID Convention, which provides for
jurisdiction over legal disputes “arising directly out of an investment”. Therefore,
jurisdiction would be restricted to matters that directly affect the Claimant’s investment,
that is, its indirect participation in the capital and in the loans of the SPVs.*°

The Respondent submits that Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention and Article 26(7) ECT
provide a separate remedy that allows companies controlled by the foreign shareholder to
claim their own damages directly. In the Respondent’s view, this would derive from the
principle of non-recognition of the locus standi of the shareholder to claim for losses of the
company, which is also established in customary international law and in advanced national
systems of mercantile law.*°*

The Respondent stresses that the exact delimitation of the investment will directly impact
upon the umbrella clause under ECT Article 10(1) in fine, upon the question of
expropriation, and upon the calculation of damages.*°>

At the Hearing, the Respondent pointed out that, with its percentage of indirect
participation in the SPVs never exceeding 50%, the Claimant neither owned nor directly
or indirectly controlled the plants, their returns, or their contracts.4°°

The Claimant’s Principal Arguments
The Claimant maintains that its investment includes not just its shareholding and

subordinated debt interests, but also other interests, such as returns, in the SPVs. In
accordance with the definition of “Jnvestment” in Article 1 ECT, Claimant’s investment

included “the plants”, “interests”, “rights and contracts” and “returns”. The Claimant
points out that the CSP Plants and Wind Farms are the essential assets of the SPVs. Returns
are covered by the definition of “Jnvestment” in ECT Article 1(6)(e) and 1(9). Rights and
contracts are also covered by ECT Articles 1(6) and 10(1), last sentence.*” In support, the
Claimant relies on Jsolux v. Spain.4°®

The Claimant dismisses the case authorities upon which the Respondent relies: ST-AD v.
Bulgaria and Postova Banka v. Hellenic Republic are not ECT cases but were decided
under differently worded BITs. Nykomb v. Latvia and RREEF v. Spain do not support
Respondent’s position.*°? The Claimant points out that RREEF v. Spain actually supports
its position!

The Claimant confirms that it is entitled to claim for the entire damage suffered by the
SPVs that own and operate the CSP Plants and the Wind Farms.*!!

At the Hearing, the Claimant relied on the Awards in Antin v. Spain, RREEF v. Spain, and
Eiser v. Spain. The Claimant maintained that it had an interest in the plants, in their
expected returns and in the rights conferred by law upon the plants. Therefore, it can claim
for its share in the decrease in value resulting from Spain’s measures affecting said
interests. The Claimant pointed out that this “jurisdictional objection” is moot since both
Experts calculated damages based on the Claimant’s stake in the CSP Plants and the Wind
Farms.*!?

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Parties are agreed that shareholders have standing, in principle, to pursue claims arising
from adverse action against the company in which they hold shares. Where they disagree
is the nature of the shareholders’ rights. The Respondent insists that a shareholder is limited
to the diminution of share value. The Claimant argues that shareholders can claim also for
damage suffered by the company.

The Tribunal must proceed from the wording of the ECT. Its definition of the term
“Investment” in Article 1(6) starts with a general reference to “every kind of asset, owned
or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor”. Therefore, indirect ownership of assets
is no obstacle to a claim. The most obvious form of indirect ownership is through
shareholding in a company that owns the assets directly.

Article 1(6) ECT offers a non-exhaustive list of assets that the investor may own or control
directly or indirectly. Apart from shareholding (Article 1(6)(b)), these assets include

“(a) tangible and intangible, and movable and immovable, property, and any property rights such
as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges;”

433 This would cover the CSP Plants and the Wind Farms and rights derived from them. These
rights may be owned or controlled directly or indirectly, i.e. through shareholding.

434 In addition, the ECT’s definition includes

“(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract having an economic value
and associated with an Investment;

LJ

 

(c) Returns;

(f) any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licences and permits granted
pursuant to law to undertake any Economic Activity in the Energy Sector.”
435 This would cover the “returns”, “rights conferred by law or contract”, and “interests” that
are contested between the Parties. These assets, too, may be owned or controlled directly
or indirectly, i.e. through shareholding.

436 In addition to its definition of “/nvestment”, the ECT contains an explicit provision on
reflective losses, albeit restricted to expropriation. Its Article 13(3) provides:

“For the avoidance of doubt, Expropriation shall include situations where a Contracting Party
expropriates the assets of a company or enterprise in its Area in which an Investor of any other
Contracting Party has an Investment, including through the ownership of shares.”

 

437 Therefore, under the ECT, at least as far as an expropriation is concerned, a shareholder
may pursue claims arising from damage it suffers it as a consequence of damage inflicted
upon a company in which it owns shares.

438 It follows that an analysis of the ECT’s text militates in favour of a shareholder’s right to
pursue claims for reflective losses.

439 Tribunal practice beyond the ECT offers a mixed picture. Some tribunals have expressed
the view that the rights of indirect investors do not go beyond what could be derived from
their shareholding.*!? In Postovd banka v. Hellenic Republic, the Tribunal said:

“a shareholder of a company incorporated in the host State may assert claims based on measures
taken against such company’s assets that impair the value of the claimant’s shares. However,

such claimant has no standing to pursue claims directly over the assets of the local company, as
it has no legal right to such assets.”*!+

Other tribunals have held that shareholders may claim also for adverse action affecting the
company’s economic position.*!> In Continental Casualty v. Argentina, the Tribunal relied
on a definition of “investment” in the Argentina-US BIT that included “a company or
shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof.” The
Tribunal summarized these rights in the following terms:

the treaty protection is not limited to the free enjoyment of the shares, that is the exercise of the
rights inherent to the position as a shareholder, specifically a controlling or sole shareholder. It
also extends to the standards of protection spelled out in the BIT with regard to the operation of
the local company that represents the investment.*'®

 

Similarly, in Arif v. Moldova the Tribunal said:

“the Tribunal finds that shareholder protection is not restricted to ownership in the shares, it
extends to the assets of the company.”*!7

In the present case, the Tribunal does not need to take a definitive position on the nature
and extent of shareholder rights in general. The Respondent does not contest the Claimant’s
ius standi in its capacity as shareholder, in principle. The difference between the Parties on
this point concerns not the existence of shareholder rights, but their nature and extent. It is,
therefore, not a matter of jurisdiction, but a question of how the claims are to be
characterized and computed. This is a matter the Tribunal addresses below in its decision
on quantum.

The Respondent relies on Article 25 ICSID Convention, which provides for the jurisdiction
of a tribunal over a “Jegal dispute arising directly out of an investment”. This requirement
of directness refers to the relationship of the dispute to the investment. It does not refer to
the character of the investment and does not exclude disputes that arise out of investments
that were made, or are held, indirectly.*'

Respondent’s reliance on Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention and on Article 26(7) ECT
does not further its argument. These provisions foresee that the parties may agree to give
standing to a locally registered company because of foreign control. This mechanism does
not derive from the principle of non-recognition of locus standi of the shareholder, as

suggested by the Respondent. Rather, it is designed to overcome the negative nationality
requirement that would otherwise exclude a locally registered company from access to
ICSID arbitration.

It follows that Jurisdictional Objection B must be dismissed.
Objection C
The Respondent’s Principal Arguments

Insofar as the Claimant’s claims under Article 10(1) ECT relate to the TVPEE and TEE,
the Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction arguing that its consent to arbitration
pursuant to Article 26 ECT is limited to alleged breaches of an obligation under Part III of
the ECT.*!? The Respondent notes that according to Article 21(1) ECT, Article 10(1) ECT
does not create any obligations with respect to taxation measures (subject to certain
exceptions not applicable here).4”° The Respondent contends that both the TVPEE and TEE
are in fact taxation measures and are therefore not encompassed by the Respondent’s
consent to arbitration.47!

In characterizing the TVPEE and TEE as taxation measures, the Respondent relies on
Article 21(7) ECT, which defines taxation measures as including “any provision relating
to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof”.

The Respondent argues that the TVPEE forms part of the domestic law of the Respondent,
i.e. the “Contracting Party”,*”? while the TEE forms part of the domestic law of a “political
subdivision” of Respondent, namely its autonomous community of Castile and Leén.4?°

As to the other requirement mentioned in Article 21(7) ECT, i.e. whether the TVPEE and
the TEE are “relating to taxes”, the Respondent submits that this question is governed by
Spanish law, mainly because Article 21(7)(a)(i) ECT refers to the domestic law of the
Contracting Party.*74 As to the TVPEE’s character as a tax under Spanish law, the
Respondent invokes Article 1 Law 15/2012, which explicitly characterizes the TVPEE as
a “tax of direct [...] nature”. In addition, the Respondent refers to MO HAP/703/2013,
which introduced a tax form to be used for the self-assessment of the TVPEE. Moreover,
the Respondent asserts that the Spanish Constitutional Court ratified the taxation nature of
the TVPEE and that the Spanish High Court approved the legality of the aforementioned
MO.*° With respect to the TEE, the Respondent refers to Article 50 of Royal Decree

Respondent submits that the taxation nature was confirmed by the Superior Court of Justice
of Castile and Leén when it ruled that Order HAC/184/2012 introducing the applicable tax
form was legal.*?*

450 The Respondent further submits that even if the legal nature of the TVPEE and the TEE
were governed by international law, they would still qualify as taxes. In this regard, the
Respondent refers in particular to EnCana v. Ecuador, whereby a tax is introduced by law
and creates a liability for classes of persons to pay money to the State for public
purposes.*”? The Respondent contends that the TVPEE and the TEE meet these criteria. In
particular, the Respondent submits that the public purpose is to create income to be
included in the general budget of the Spanish State or of Castile and Le6n, respectively.*”°
Moreover, the Respondent asserts that the EC confirmed the tax nature of the TVPEE,*?!
while the Court of Justice of the European Union confirmed that a measure materially
identical to the TEE (imposed in another autonomous community of the Respondent)
constituted a direct tax.4*?

451 In addition, the Respondent submits that its position on the taxation nature of the TVPEE
was shared by the tribunal in Jsolux v. Spain.

452 The Respondent opposes the Claimant’s view that one must further assess whether the
TVPEE and TEE are bona fide taxation measures. The Respondent argues that such a test
was only applied in Yukos v. Russia, which award however was quashed and, in any event,
was based on extraordinary circumstances not present in the instant case, namely actions
taken under the guise of taxation to destroy a company or eliminate a political opponent.*™4
Moreover, the Respondent submits that the Claimant’s assessment of the economic effects
of the TVPEE and the TEE is irrelevant, given that in EnCana v. Ecuador it was held that
what counts is the legal operation, not the economic effect of the measures in question.4*>
In addition, the Respondent contends that both the TVPEE and the TEE are bona fide
taxation measures anyway.” In particular, the fact that an amount equivalent to that levied
through the TVPEE is used to finance the costs of the SES does not call into question that
the TVPEE is levied to finance public expenses, given the public interest in a sustainable

electricity system.**’ Furthermore, the Respondent maintains that the TVPEE does not
discriminate against renewable energy producers: First, it applies to renewable and
conventional energy producers alike.**® Secondly, while only conventional energy
producers are able to pass the TVPEE on to consumers, the TVPEE is one of the costs that
are remunerated to renewable producers through the Specific Remuneration, thus
neutralizing the economic effect of this tax,**? in addition to its being tax-deductible for
the purposes of Spanish corporate tax.*#°

Furthermore, the Respondent argues that the Claimant cannot invoke most favoured nation
(“MFN’”) treatment via the clawback provision of Article 21(3) ECT. The Respondent
refers to the Energy Charter Secretariat’s “Reader's Guide” to the ECT (“ECT Reader’s
Guide”), according to twhich the clawback is limited to indirect taxes, and asserts that
neither the TVPEE nor the TEE are indirect taxes. Instead, the Respondent contends that
the TVPEE is a tax on income, noting in particular that under the definition of Article
21(7)(b) ECT, it is irrelevant whether it is the gross or net income that is being taxed.” As
to the TEE, the Respondent asserts that it is a tax on capital because the taxable event is
the ownership of a wind turbine and, thus, the ownership of capital.

Finally, the Respondent submits that even if Article 21(3) ECT were applicable, this would
still not afford MFN treatment to Claimant in respect of the TVPEE and the TEE. In the
Respondent’s view, this follows from Article 21(3)(a) ECT, which excludes MFN
treatment related to any obligations “with respect to advantages accorded by a Contracting
Party pursuant to the tax provisions of any [...] agreement [...] described in subparagraph
(7)(a)(ii)”. In turn, Article 21(7)(a)(ii) ECT refers to any international agreement to which
Respondent is bound. The Respondent contends that the BITs that the Claimant seeks to
invoke through the MEN clause are international agreements within the meaning of Article
21(7)(a)Gi) ECT and, therefore, fall under the exclusion of Article 21(3)(a) ECT.

The Claimant’s Principal Arguments
The Claimant argues that the TVPEE and TEE are not in fact bona fide taxation measures,
but rather a cut on remuneration introduced under the guise of taxation, and therefore do

not fall within the scope of the taxation carve-out provided for in Article 21(1) ECT.

Specifically, the Claimant submits that according to Spanish general taxation legislation, a
tax aims at yielding revenue to finance public expenses, and is levied on transactions, acts

or events that evidence taxpayers’ economic capacity.4 According to Claimant, neither of
these two essential features of a tax is present for the TVPEE or the TEE.

As to the TVPEE, the Claimant asserts that the purpose of this measure is not to finance
public expenses, but to impose on producers of electricity the obligation to reduce the tariff
imbalance in the SES, which is to be distinguished from the State itself.“47 Moreover, the
Claimant argues that the TVPEE does not charge economic capacity, but rather the amount
of electricity produced, without any regard to profits or losses stemming from this
activity.“° In addition, the Claimant contends that the TVPEE does not serve the
environmental purpose for which it was allegedly introduced, inter alia because it charges
all electricity producers in the same way, irrespective of the impact that each technology
has on the environment; instead, according to Claimant, contemporary statements by the
Minister of Energy confirm that the TVPEE has the same effect as a retroactive cut in the
remuneration that renewable energy producers were previously entitled to.4”7 Moreover,
the Claimant asserts that the TVPEE discriminates against renewable energy producers
because, contrary to producers of conventional energy, they cannot pass this extra cost on
to consumers because of the mandatory Regulated Tariff applicable as of 1 January 2013;
according to the Claimant, the Respondent has failed to demonstrate that the TVPEE is
compensated for as part of the Specific Remuneration, in particular because the
remuneration is calculated not based on the actual costs of each facility, but rather based
on hypothetical costs of standard facilities.*#*

Also, the Claimant argues that contrary to the Respondent’s suggestion, neither the EC nor
the Spanish Constitutional Court ratified the nature of the TVPEE as a tax.” In particular,
the Spanish Constitutional Court merely rejected a constitutional challenge against the
TVPEE based on narrow grounds invoked by the applicant in that case, while at the same
time the Spanish Constitutional Court did in fact raise doubts as to the compatibility of the
TVPEE with the Spanish Constitution on other grounds, namely that the TVPEE is levied
on gross revenues and that it is disconnected from its alleged environmental purpose.*”

With respect to the TEE, the Claimant argues that its purpose is likewise not of an
environmental nature, as claimed by the government of Castile and Leon. Rather, it is
meant to provide further income to the SES, meaning that also the TEE does not finance
public expenses.**! The Claimant contends that the TEE is thus nothing but a retroactive
cut in the remuneration to wind farms.*°

Moreover, the Claimant submits that even if the TVPEE and TEE were bona fide taxation
measures, the Tribunal would still have jurisdiction over them because they would fall

under the clawback provided for in Article 21(3) ECT, which obliges the Respondent to
afford MFN treatment under Article 10(7) ECT in relation to taxes “other than those on
income or on capital”. Via certain BITs to which the Respondent is a party, the MFN
treatment allows the Claimant to invoke, in respect of the TVPEE and TEE, the very
standards that it relies on under Article 10(1) ECT.*?

461 Contrary to the Respondent’s argument, the Claimant contends that for the purposes of
Article 21(3) ECT, the distinction between direct or indirect taxes is irrelevant, and that the
ECT Reader’s Guide does not exclude direct taxes from falling under Article 21(3) ECT.4*

462 The Claimant submits that the TVPEE is not a tax on income because it is levied on gross
revenues, while according to the OECD taxes on income are charged on net income.**’ Per
the Claimant, this position of the OECD is highly relevant because the definition in Article
21(7)(b) ECT mirrors the definition of “taxes on income and on capital” in the OECD
Model Tax Convention.**° Moreover, the Claimant notes that the Respondent’s double
taxation treaties cover taxes levied on gross revenues only in case of entities without a
taxable presence in Spain, while the TVPEE is levied on gross revenues of entities that do
have a taxable presence in Spain.*°”

463 Likewise, the Claimant asserts that the TEE is not a tax on capital because it is levied on
the mere ownership of a wind farm and is calculated based on the installed capacity,
regardless to the owner’s capital, income, or the market value of the wind farm.*°8
Furthermore, according to the Claimant, the TEE is different from any of the examples of
taxes on income or capital that are mentioned in Article 21(7)(b) ECT.*?

464 Moreover, the Claimant opposes the Respondent’s argument that Article 21(7)(a)(ii) ECT
results in the inapplicability of the clawback provision of Article 21(3) ECT. The Claimant
contends that Article 21(7)(a)(ii) ECT excludes MEN treatment only for “tax provisions”
in international treaties. However, none of the BITs relied on by Claimant includes any
such tax provisions.4°

465 Finally, the Claimant submits that /solux v. Spain does not support the Respondent’s
position. First, solux v. Spain accepted that Article 21(1) ECT applies only to bona fide
taxation measures and that this requires, in particular, that the purpose is to raise revenue

for the State. Contrary to the claimant in Jsolux v. Spain, the Claimant asserts that it has
established that the TVPEE does not pursue the objective of raising revenue for public
purposes. Secondly, as the claimant in that case did not invoke MFN treatment via Article
21(3) ECT, Isolux v. Spain did not make any finding in this regard.*°!

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

466 = Article 21 ECT reads, in relevant part, as follows:

“(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or
impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. [...]
[..]
(3) Article 10(2) and (7) shall apply to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties other than
those on income or on capital, except that such provisions shall not apply to:

(a) impose most favoured nation obligations with respect to advantages accorded by a

Contracting Party pursuant to the tax provisions of any convention, agreement or
arrangement described in subparagraph (7)(a)(ii) [...]

Ll
(5) (a) Article 13 shall apply to taxes. [...]

[..]
(7) For the purposes of this Article:
(a) The term “Taxation Measure” includes:
(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a
political subdivision thereof [...]; and
(ii) any provision relating to taxes of [...] any other international agreement or
arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound.
(b) There shall be regarded as taxes on income or on capital all taxes imposed on total
income, on total capital or on elements of income or of capital, including taxes on gains from
the alienation of property, taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts, or substantially similar
taxes, taxes on the total amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises, as well as taxes on
capital appreciation.”

467 Asapreliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent’s Objection C is limited to
the Claimant’s assertion of a breach of Article 10(1) ECT, while it does not apply to the
alleged breach of Article 13 ECT.*™ This is consistent with Article 21(5) ECT, which
makes clear that Article 13 ECT does apply to taxation measures.

468 Accordingly, it is for the Tribunal to determine whether the tax carve-out in Article 21(1)
ECT deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction over the asserted breach of Article 10(1) ECT as
regards the TVPEE and TEE. This presupposes that (i) the TVPEE and TEE are “Taxation
Measures” within the meaning of Article 21(1) ECT, (ii) neither of the two measures is
removed from the scope of the tax carve-out based on an abuse of rights and (iii) the claw-

back of Article 21(3) ECT does not, in conjunction with Article 10(7) ECT and other
Spanish BITs, bring the TVPEE and TEE back under protections in those BITs that are
corresponding to Article 10(1) ECT. Each of these three requirements will be dealt with in
turn in subsections a. to c. infra.

TVPEE and TEE as “Taxation Measures”

The definition of the term “Taxation Measures” in Article 21(7)(a)(i) ECT has two
elements. First, the measure in question must be a provision of the domestic law of the
Contracting Party or a political subdivision thereof. Secondly, such provision must relate
to taxes.

The Tribunal has no doubt that the first element of the definition is met for both the TVPEE
and the TEE. The legislation introducing the TVPEE (Articles 1-11 of Law 15/2012)
consist of provisions of the domestic law of the Respondent, i.e. the Contracting Party.
Similarly, the legislation introducing the TEE (Articles 19-25 of Regional Act 1/2012)
consist of provisions of the domestic law of Castile and Leén, which is a political
subdivision of the Respondent. While the Claimant raises doubts as to the constitutionality
of the TVPEE, it does not specifically argue that the relevant provisions of domestic law
are a legal nullity. Even if such argument had been made, the Tribunal does not see itself
in a position to make such finding based on the record before it.4% In particular, the
Tribunal notes that the Spanish Constitutional Court rejected a constitutional challenge
against the TVPEE.** While it is true that in a subsequent judgment, the Court “raise[d]
the question of unconstitutionality”,*® this question was left undecided. Such obiter dictum
is not sufficient for the Tribunal to be satisfied that the TVPEE does in fact violate the
Spanish Constitution. Much less is it sufficient for the Tribunal to find that the relevant
provision of domestic law is null and void (so that the TVPEE is no longer based on a
provision of domestic law), given that laws passed by Spanish parliament are valid, from
a Spanish law perspective, unless and until declared unconstitutional by the Spanish
Constitutional Court, which has not happened.

 

With respect to the second element of the definition in Article 21(7)(a)(i) ECT, the Parties
disagree as to how the Tribunal should ascertain whether the provisions of domestic law
introducing the TVPEE and the TEE are related to taxes. The Tribunal finds that it can

leave this question undecided because both the TVPEE and the TEE qualify as taxes under
any of the standards advanced by the Parties.*”

472 From the perspective of Spanish law, the Tribunal finds that the TVPEE and the TEE do
have all necessary characteristics of a tax.

473 First, the legislation introducing these measures explicitly refers to them as taxes and
provides for tax forms to be filled out in relation thereto. In and of itself, this is a strong
indication that the TVPEE and TEE are in fact taxes under Spanish law — irrespective of
the fact that framing a measure as a tax under domestic law could be an abuse of rights
under international law, which is a different question and will be dealt with in section b.
infra.

474 — Secondly, the Spanish Constitutional Court dismissed a constitutional challenge against the
TVPEE, while the Spanish High Court approved the legality of the Ministerial Order
introducing the respective tax form and the Superior Court of Justice of Castile and Leon
dismissed a challenge against a tax form relating to the TEE. In doing so, none of these
Spanish courts raised any doubts as to the tax nature of the TVPEE or TEE, respectively.
Quite the contrary, considering that the Spanish Constitutional Court specifically referred
to the TVPEE as a “tax”.46

475 Thirdly, as per both Parties’ submission on Spanish general taxation legislation, a tax in
Spain is characterized by two elements, namely aiming at yielding revenue to finance
public expenses and being levied on transactions, acts or events that evidence taxpayers’
economic capacity. Contrary to Claimant’s position, the Tribunal has no doubt that these
two elements are in fact met in case of the TVPEE and TEE.*” Both measures clearly aim
at yielding revenue to finance public expenses, irrespective of whether these expenses are
incurred by the SES or in the protection of the environment. Also, as they are tied to the
amount of electricity transmitted into the grid (TVPEE) or to the capacity to produce
energy (TEE), both measures undoubtedly are levied as a function of the economic capacity

461 The taxation nature of the TVPEE has been confirmed also in Isolux v. Spain, 722; Eiser v. Spain, 4266;

of energy producers.*”° After all, the more electricity is or can (due to capacity) be sold,
the more income is or can be generated.

476 _ If one instead treats the question of whether the TVPEE and TEE are taxes as a question of
international law, the Tribunal comes to the same result. In this regard, the Tribunal
endorses the test developed in EnCana vy. Ecuador and employed by numerous other
tribunals, i.e. whether the measure at stake is imposed by law and creates a liability for
classes of persons to pay money to the State for public purposes.*”! There is no doubt in
the Tribunal’s mind that all requirements of this test are met. First, as per above, both the
TVPEE and the TEE were imposed by law. Secondly, they create a liability for all energy
producers (i.e. a class of persons) to pay money to the State (the Respondent or its
subdivision Castile and Leén). Thirdly, this is done for a public purpose (whether it be the
protection of the environment or the financing of the electricity deficit, see on this issue
481 infra).

b. Abuse of rights

477 — The Tribunal agrees with Antin v. Spain that

if a measure bears the hallmarks of a tax under the applicable domestic law and under the general
approach taken by international law, it is very likely that the measure will be excluded by
operation of ECT Article 21. However, in exceptional circumstances a measure that bears such
hallmarks could not benefit from the taxation exclusion if a claimant is able to demonstrate a
lack of good faith on the part of the respondent.*””

 

478 In other words, the tax carve-out of Article 21(1) ECT applies only to bona fide taxation
measures*”? and therefore does not apply if the respondent State commits an abuse of rights

by framing the measure at stake as a tax.4”4

479 However, in line with well-settled jurisprudence on this issue, the Tribunal finds that there
is a presumption that the TVPEE or TEE were enacted as bona fide taxation measures and
that it is for the Claimant to disprove this presumption.‘”° In the words of Isolux v. Spain,
this requires the Claimant to establish that the TVPEE and TEE were “not enacted with the
purpose of raising revenue for the State but with a different purpose” *”° This is a very high

taxable amount is the “economic value” of the energy produced, see its Judgment of 14 June 2016, Case 2554/2014

bar.47” It requires the Claimant to prove “extraordinary or “exceptiona
circumstances that evidence an “extreme purpose”**® or “egregious abuse of tax power”**',
such as a pattern of behaviour aimed at destroying the investor**? or at least the investment.
This very stringent requirement is due to the fact that States have a wide latitude in
imposing and enforcing taxation laws, and that it is not for the Tribunal to substitute the
Respondent’s policy choices with its own political propositions on how to micromanage

the Respondent’s tax policy.**°

480 For the following reasons, and on the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal finds that
the Claimant did not succeed in crossing this high evidentiary threshold.***

481 First, while the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that there are some question marks as to
whether the stated objective of the TVPEE and the TEE, namely to protect the
environment, could in fact be achieved by these taxes given the way they are designed,**>
this does not of itself suffice to constitute an abuse of rights. As a starting point, the
Tribunal does not find it impossible that an indirect environmental purpose can in fact be
attained, in particular because the amounts raised via the TVPEE and the TEE**® help
covering the costs of the SES, of which subsidies to renewable energy producers form a
significant part.**” Moreover, even if the TVPEE and TEE did not serve any environmental
purpose and their real objective was the one asserted by the Claimant, namely to finance
the Tariff Deficit, this would not help the Claimant’s case. After all, financing the SES is
undoubtedly a public purpose, which is therefore open to tax financing, without this
evidencing any mala fide intentions on the part of Respondent.*** Also, the Tribunal notes

adverse environmental effects). Contrary to what the Claimant seems to suggest,** the
Tribunal agrees with 9REN v. Spain that this is

the normal function of a budget, and there is nothing inherently improper or unusual in making
a budget appropriation in support of the electricity system.*””

482 Secondly, it is irrelevant whether the same economic effect could have been achieved by a
cut on remuneration.*”! As per Encana v. Ecuador, an economic analysis of a measure
should not displace a finding that a measure is a tax as a matter of law.*”* Moreover, even
if the TVPEE and TEE have the commercial effect of reducing the Claimant’s revenue,
that is the effect of virtually any tax and cannot be a proper factual basis for the inference
that the Respondent acted mala fide.”

483 Thirdly, for the same reason, the Tribunal does not consider that mala fides is evidenced
by the Minister of Energy openly acknowledging this fact, i.e. that the commercial effect
of the TVPEE is functionally equivalent to a tariff cut.4°* Also, should the Claimant’s
suggestion be that the Respondent was aware that a tariff cut would not have been
permissible under the ECT, and chose for this reason to achieve the same result by
introducing the TVPEE,””> the Minister of Energy’s statements do not lend any support to
such theory. To begin with, the Minister of Energy making such statements in public is
hardly consistent with there being a motive to dissimulate.‘° In addition, such theory
presupposes that RFI could not be altered, that the Respondent so knew and that it therefore
knowingly framed a tariff cut as a tax in order to circumvent Article 10(1) ECT. In this
regard, the Tribunal notes and agrees with Masdar v. Spain that:

that proposition itself presupposes that the dispute between the Parties as to the nature of the
commitments made by Respondent is not a good faith dispute and that Respondent’s conduct is
tainted with bad faith. That is not a leap that the Tribunal is prepared to make.*””

484 Fourthly, neither the TVPEE nor the TEE aim specifically at the Claimant or even at foreign
investors in general.4°8 Also, contrary to the Claimant’s assertion, the TVPEE does not
seem to discriminate against renewable energy producers because it is levied also on
conventional producers. While renewable energy producers may not be able to pass on the
tax to consumers since the Pool Price Plus Premium option was abolished, the Tribunal
accepts that TVPEE is an operating cost taken into account in the Specific Remuneration*””

and a deductible expense for corporate tax purposes. This suggests that the impact of the
TVPEE is either neutralized entirely or, in case of discrepancies between Respondent’s
operating assumptions for standard facilities and the operation of actual facilities,» at least
significantly diminished.*”! Even if the TVPEE or TEE had a greater effect on renewable
energy producers, this would not change their character as a bona fide tax because, as held
in Cube v. Spain, there is

no reason why producers of renewable energy should not be treated as a distinct class for the
purposes of taxation, just as they were treated as members of a distinct class for the purposes of
the Special Regime and its attendant benefits.*

   

Finally, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that the TVPEE and TEE are not in any way
comparable to the extreme cases that the tribunals in Yukos v. Russia or RosInvest v. Russia
found they were faced with, namely State measures aimed at destroying investments or
investors under the guise of taxation.>*

Claw-back of Article 21(3) ECT

Given that the TVPEE and TEE therefore fall under the tax carve-out of Article 21(1) ECT,
the Tribunal could assume jurisdiction over these measures (other than in relation to
Article 13 ECT) only if the claw-back of Article 21(3) ECT applied and referred the
Tribunal, via the MEN treatment of Article 10(7), to other investment treaties through
which Spain accorded protection to foreign investors also in respect of taxation measures.

To begin with, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the BIT provisions it relies on do
not fall under the exclusionary provision of Article 21(3)(a) ECT because, contrary to the
Respondent’s argument, those BIT provisions are not “tax provisions” as required by
Article 21(3)(a) ECT. Rather, they are provisions that guarantee fair and equitable
treatment, respect of obligations entered into by Spain (umbrella clauses), full protection
and security as well as non-impairment.>

However, the plain wording of Article 21(3) ECT makes clear that the claw-back requires
that the TVPEE and TEE are taxes “other than [...] on income or on capital”. As it is the
Claimant who seeks to invoke Article 21(3) ECT, the burden is on the Claimant to establish
that this requirement is met. On the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal is not
satisfied that the Claimant has discharged this burden.

500 Cf, BRR II, 9263-265; see, however, also Brattle’s Memorandum dated 5 August 2020, §39 (“The Remuneration
under the New Regulatory Regime included explicit compensation for the 7% TVPEE, which effectively ‘Neutralized”
the impact of the 7% TVPEE.”)

In relation to the TVPEE, the Claimant argues that it is not a tax on income because it is
levied on gross revenue rather than on profit. The Tribunal is not convinced by this
argument. Pursuant to the definition in Article 21(7)(b) ECT:

There shall be regarded as taxes on income or on capital all taxes imposed on total income, on
total capital or on elements of income or of capital, including taxes on gains from alienation of
property, taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts, or substantially similar taxes, taxes on the total

   

 

amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises, as well as taxes on capital appreciation.”

 

Based on this definition, the Tribunal agrees with NextEra v. Spain that “[t]here is no basis
for assuming that the reference to income in Article 21(3) of the ECT was a reference to
net income”.* Instead, the Tribunal has no hesitation in finding that the TVPEE is a tax
on (total) income.*°°

Contrary to the Claimant’s view, this is not changed by the fact that the OECD Model Tax
Convention of 1992 contains a definition of “taxes on income and on capital” that is similar
to Article 21(7)(b) ECT, and that the OECD Factbook of 2014 describes taxes on income
as being levied on net income.*” First, Article 21(7)(b) ECT is even broader than the
OECD Model Tax Convention because it covers also “substantially similar taxes”.
Secondly, the Tribunal is not convinced that the OECD Factbook purports to give a general
and exhaustive definition of “taxes on income”; instead, the sentence referred to by the
Claimant merely seems to explain which types of taxes the OECD Factbook included in a
statistic provided therein. Thirdly, while it may well be true that taxes on income are
typically levied on net income, this does not mean that taxes levied on gross income are
not taxes on income; in fact, the Tribunal finds it difficult to see any other category of taxes
into which taxes on gross income could otherwise fall.

The Tribunal also fails to see how this analysis could be changed by the fact that the
Respondent’s double taxation treaties cover taxes levied on gross revenues only with
respect to entities without a taxable presence in Spain (while the TVPEE applies only to
entities with a taxable presence in Spain). If at all, this disproves the Claimant’s argument
that taxes on income are always levied on net income.

Finally, the Tribunal also agrees with 9REN v. Spain that:

there is nothing objectionable to a tax on revenue rather than profit. Multinational corporations
can structure themselves to allocate profits to different jurisdictions to suit their corporate
purposes, which may not align with the legitimate interest of the host country.*°*

Turning to the TEE, the Tribunal finds that it is a tax on capital because, as noted by the
Respondent, the taxable event is ownership of capital, namely of a wind turbine. While the
Claimant correctly points out that the tax base is the relevant facility’s capacity rather than

505 NextEra v. Spain, 1383.

498

the amount invested into, the market value of, or the revenue generated by the relevant
facility, the Tribunal does not find that this calls into question the TEE’s nature as a tax on
capital. Given the wide latitude of States to design their tax laws, the Tribunal finds nothing
objectionable to the Respondent using a facility’s capacity as a proxy for the value of the
taxpayer’s capital. After all, the capacity of a wind turbine determines the amount of energy
it can produce, which in turn reflects its ability to generate revenue and, thus, directly
impacts its market value. While other factors such as location or technical design of the
turbine etc. will also play a role for the market value, the Tribunal does not consider that
the Respondent deciding not to take such other factors into account for the tax base makes
the TEE a tax other than on capital.

Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the claw-back of Article 21(3) ECT does not apply
and that, therefore, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over alleged breaches of the ECT (other
than its Article 13) to the extent they rest on the TVPEE and TEE. It follows that the
Tribunal upholds Objection C. As a result thereof, when referring on the merits to the
Disputed Measures in the context of Article 10(1) ECT, this reference excludes the TVPEE
and the TEE.

Objection D

In its Memorial on Preliminary Objections, the Respondent raised as “Objection G” the
objection that the claim brought under Article 13 ECT against the TVPEE and TEE was
inadmissible because the time limit provided for in Article 21(5)(b) ECT had not yet
expired. Although the Respondent re-named this objection “Objection D” in its Reply on
Preliminary Objections, it stated at the same time that this claim “has become admissible”
due to the time limit having expired in the meantime.*” Therefore, the Tribunal finds that
the Respondent has effectively abandoned this objection and that it is thus not necessary
for the Tribunal to make any ruling on it.

Objection E
The Respondent’s Principal Arguments

In the Respondent’s view, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the Claimant’s claim
for a tax gross-up, which is based on the Claimant’s assertion that any amount awarded to
the Claimant by this Tribunal would allegedly attract taxes in Luxembourg.

The Respondent submits that Article 21(1) ECT establishes a “Tax Gross-Up carve-out”
by providing that the ECT does not create any rights or obligations with respect to taxation
measures of the Contracting Parties. As Luxembourg is a Contracting Party, the
Respondent argues that the ECT creates no obligation of the Respondent to compensate
the Claimant for losses it may incur as a result of Luxembourg taxes.*!?

50 MoPO, 1476-480; RoPO, 493 10-313.

109

499 In addition, the Respondent contends that holding it liable for taxation measures of
Luxembourg would be contrary to Article 2 of the International Law Commission’s
Articles on Responsibility of States (the “ILC Articles”*''), which requires conduct
attributable to the State that is to be held liable.*!? In support of this argument, the
Respondent refers to Rusoro v. Venezuela, which found as follows:

In its Memorial and Reply, Rusoro sought indemnity in respect of any double taxation of the
Award that may in Canada (or elsewhere), to the extent this liability would not have arisen
had Venezuela observed its international commitments under the Treaty. This claim seems to
have been abandoned in Rusoro’s Post Hearing Brief. In any case, the claim lacks merit. Any
tax liability arising under Canadian tax laws (or from any other fiscal regime, other than the
Venezuelan), does not qualify as consequential loss arising from Venezuela’s breach of the
Treaty and does not engage Venezuela’s liability.5"3

 

 

 

  

500 Finally, the Respondent invokes the “Monetary Gold” principle recognised by the
International Court of Justice. In the Respondent’s view, this principle should lead the
Tribunal not to assume jurisdiction over the tax gross-up claim for two reasons. First, the
Tribunal would otherwise need to pronounce itself on the authority of Luxembourg to
subject the arbitral award to taxation, without taking into account that pursuant to Article
21(1) ECT, Luxembourg did not give its consent to arbitrate tax-related matters under the
ECT. Secondly, Luxembourg was not invited to participate in this proceeding to defend its
tax authority.>!

2. The Claimant’s Principal Arguments

501 The Claimant argues that the Respondent should be estopped from raising this objection
because it failed to raise it in at least one other ICSID case where a tax gross-up was
requested.>!>

502 Moreover, the Claimant asserts that its claim for tax gross-up is not aimed at challenging
any taxation measure, but rather intends to give effect to the principle of full reparation
enshrined in international law. According to the Claimant, this principle is not affected by
the tax carve-out in Article 21(1) ECT.*!®

508

In addition, the Claimant submits that several arbitral tribunals, in particular Siemens v.
Argentina and Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela, have issued awards in which the amount
of damages is calculated net of taxes.*!7

Furthermore, the Claimant contends that the “Monetary Gold” principle does not apply
because the Tribunal would merely need to pronounce itself on whether any potential taxes
that an award could attract in Luxembourg need to be borne by the Respondent, as opposed
to the Claimant. As the Claimant would never have to face such taxes had it not been for
the Respondent’s wrongful acts, it is fair that the Respondent is the one who bears those
expenses.>!®

Finally, the Claimant argues that the Respondent is confusing the concepts of an
internationally wrongful act and its consequences. It is the wrongful act (the Disputed
Measures), not its consequences (hypothetical taxes imposed in Luxembourg), that must
be attributable to a State to hold it liable under international law. In accordance with the
principle of full reparation, the consequences of the wrongful act must be fully
compensated by the State to which the act is attributable.

The Tribunal’s Analysis

In the Tribunal’s view, by stating that the ECT does not, in principle, create any rights or
obligations in respect of taxation measures, Article 21(1) ECT merely provides that, subject
to certain exceptions not relevant here, an investor cannot claim a breach of the ECT in
relation to taxation measures.

Based on this understanding, the Tribunal finds that Claimant’s claim for a tax gross-up
does not fall within the scope of this tax carve-out in Article 21(1) ECT. This is because
the claim for tax gross-up is not in fact based on the assertion that a Contracting Party’s
tax laws violate the ECT. Rather, the claim rests on the allegation that the Disputed
Measures are in breach of the ECT. Except for the TVPEE and TEE, none of the Disputed
Measures are taxation measures. Luxembourg’s tax laws enter the picture solely on the
level of quantum, namely as a fact that, according to Claimant, has an impact on the amount
that needs to be awarded to it so that it is fully compensated for Respondent’s alleged
breaches of the ECT.>!

For the same reason, ILC Article 2 does not prevent the Tribunal from assuming
jurisdiction over the tax gross-up claim. Apart from it being doubtful whether this argument
goes to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction rather than the merits, it is the alleged wrongful act (i.e.
the Disputed Measures) that must be attributable to the State to be held liable. Whether or

not taxes levied by the investor’s home State qualify as consequential losses is a matter of
quantum and will be addressed in that context.°”°

Likewise, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent’s argument that the “Monetary
Gold” principle should lead it to deny jurisdiction over the tax gross-up claim. Contrary to
the Respondent’s suggestion, deciding on this claim will not require the Tribunal to
pronounce itself on the legality or propriety of Luxembourg’s taxation measures that may
apply to any amount awarded by the Tribunal. Therefore, the Tribunal also fails to see why
Luxembourg, which will not be affected by the Tribunal’s award, should have been invited
to submit its position in this regard.

Consequently, the Tribunal finds that neither Article 21(1) nor any other provision of the
ECT or any principle of international law prevent the Tribunal from assuming jurisdiction
over the Claimant’s claim for tax gross-up.

Objection F*?!
The Respondent’s Principal Arguments

The Respondent argues that the Claimant does not have an investment for purposes of

Article 1(6) ECT or Article 25 ICSID Convention. Under both treaties, according to the

Respondent, the investment would have to be an investment in the “objective or ordinary
99 522

sense”.

In the Respondent’s view, under the ECT the existence of an investment in an objective
sense would require the contribution of economic resources and the assumption of a risk.
The essence of the ordinary meaning of “investment” involves an active behaviour, i.e. an
action that consists of making a cash contribution with a view to obtaining a profit.°* If
the Claimant has not made economic contributions and has not assumed the risks inherent
to the investment, it has not made an investment in an objective sense according to the
Respondent.>**4

The Respondent points out that, for purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, an
investment includes four elements, namely, a substantial contribution of funds, a certain
duration, the assumption of risk and a contribution to the host State’s development.*?>

520 See section VIILC.5 infra.

521 This objection was initially named “Objection A” by the Respondent. However, it w:

 

s later withdrawn (subsequent

to which the Respondent re-labelled the old “Objection C” into “Objection A”) and was finally revived, without any
denomination, in reply to Procedural Order No. 13. For ease of reference, the Tribunal refers to this objection as
“Objection F”.

According to the Respondent, this means that for an investment to exist, both the ECT and
the ICSID Convention require at least a contribution of funds, a certain duration and the
assumption of a risk.°?°

It is the Respondent’s position that the Claimant has not made any investment under either
treaty because it has not contributed any funds or assumed the risks inherent to an
investment. Rather, the contribution of funds and the assumption of risk are attributable
exclusively to Mr. Gémez, who decided to transfer his assets to a shell company in
Luxembourg, namely the Claimant.>”’

In addition, the Respondent states that the Claimant’s alleged investment must be restricted
to its indirect stake in the capital of and the loans to the SPVs. It does not extend to the
profitability or other assets of these Plants.*7*

Moreover, the Respondent posits that the Claimant does not indirectly own stakes in the
capital or in the participating credit of the Wind Farms and CSP Plants because Article 1(6)
ECT requires that assets be owned or controlled directly or indirectly by “an Investor”. By
using the singular for “/Jnvestor”, the ECT indicates that there can only be one investor that
indirectly owns the investment. Only the final element in the chain of ownership counts.
The Claimant is a mere link in the chain of ownership which binds the assets to their final
and true owner, Mr. Gomez. Therefore, the Claimant does not indirectly own the assets in
question.>?

Similarly, the Respondent contends that the only person who controls the alleged
investment is Mr. Gomez, while the Claimant does not exercise de facto or de jure
control.

Furthermore, the Respondent claims that the Claimant is not an “Jnvestor” under the terms
of the ECT. Article 1(7)(a)(ii) speaks of “a company or other organisation”. Under the
definition in the dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish language, under EU law as
well as under Luxembourg law, a company would be an organization that provides goods
or services. An entity that merely holds shares in other companies is not a company.>*! This
interpretation is supported by Article 17 ECT, denying the advantages of the ECT in the
absence of substantial business activities. Article 17 does not use the term “company or
other organisation” but the expression “legal entity”. The Claimant does not have any
material or human resources of its own, is not engaged in any economic activity and lacks
a physical presence. Therefore, it is not a company or other organization in the sense of
Article 1(7)(a)(ii) ECT and, consequently, is not an “/nvestor” for purposes of Article 1(7)
ECT 52

For the Respondent it follows that the Claimant does not have an “Jnvestment” under the
ECT because it has not engaged in any investment activity in an objective or ordinary
sense, it does not own or control, directly or indirectly, the assets, nor is it an “Jnvestor”
under Article 1(7).>°

In its Reply on Preliminary Objections, the Respondent made the following statement:

in view of the documentation in the proceeding and the disparity of arbitration criteria as regards
the concept of investment, in this Reply on Jurisdiction the Kingdom of Spain partially
withdraws from Preliminary Objection A of the Memorial on Preliminary Objections regarding
the lack of investment. [...] Preliminary Objection A of the Memorial of Preliminary Objections
remains, however, in respect of the determination of the assets comprising the investment of the
Claimant.>*

The Respondent merged what remained of Objection A with Objection E, renumbered as
Objection B (dealt with in section B. supra).

After the Hearing, in Procedural Order No. 13 of 19 December 2018, the Tribunal directed
the following question No. 3 to the Parties:

What precisely were the transactions whereby Renergy acquired the investments under dispute?
Who owned or controlled the seller and the purchaser? What is the relevance, if any, of the
Award in KT Asia v. Kazakhstan (17 October 2013), especially paragraphs 199-206, to this
case?” (italics original)

The Respondent’s Answer to the Tribunal’s Post-Hearing Question No. 3*** revives aspects
of its original Preliminary Objection A. The Respondent points out that the Tribunal must
verify its jurisdiction ex officio and that the burden to prove jurisdiction lies on the
Claimant.**°

The Respondent insists that the Claimant must establish that it has made an investment
protected under the ECT and the ICSID Convention. It insists on an objective definition of
investment which comprises a contribution of resources, duration and risk.>°7

In the Respondent’s view, the Claimant has not made any contribution or allocation of
resources. Mr. G6mez and not the Claimant is the real investor, the latter being a mere shell
company without any kind of activity.**

The Wind Farms were commissioned and became operational in 2004 and 2007. At that
time, the Claimant did not exist. It was only subsequently that the ultimate ownership of
the Wind Farms was assigned to the Claimant. Mr. Gomez incorporated the Claimant on

Mr. Gomez owns 100% of its share capital.>*?

The Respondent points out that the Claimant is a mere shell company without tangible or
intangible assets except for the financial assets in the Spanish subsidiaries. It lacks ordinary
revenue due to sales or revenues and has no employees. There is no evidence of payment
by the Claimant for the acquisition of the corporate shares and loans.*“?

The Respondent presents a similar analysis of the Claimant’s acquisition of the CSP
investment. There is no evidence that the Claimant invested any amount for the acquisition
of the stakes or loans. The alleged investment was a mere transfer of assets without any
contribution of funds made by the Claimant. Mr. Gémez is not only the ultimate owner but
also the party that has contributed the funds. In all relevant share transfers he represented
both Parties.~!

The Respondent relies on KT Asia v. Kazakhstan, where the Tribunal found that in the
absence of a payment the investor had made no contribution with respect to its alleged
investment. It would follow that the investment of the Claimant is in reality the investment
of Mr. Gémez, who decided to transfer his assets to a shell company. Various transactions
were made for the purchase, sale and assignment of assets with investees of Mr. Gomez.
without the Claimant ever having to make an effective contribution of funds. The
Claimant’s funds stem from Mr. Gomez, who funds the group companies by means of
participating loans. The loans acquired by the Claimant were assigned by Mr. Gémez or
other group companies.*4”

It follows for the Respondent that the Claimant has not made an investment and that the
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae to hear the present dispute.**

The Claimant’s Principal Arguments

The Claimant points out that the Respondent conflates two separate issues: jurisdiction
ratione materiae and jurisdiction ratione personae. It proceeds to address these two issues
separately.>#

The Claimant rejects the notion of an investment in the “ordinary and objective sense” and
dismisses the need to look at the “final link of the chain of ownership”. These concepts
have no place in Article 1(6) ECT and Article 25(1) ICSID Convention.*5

The Claimant sets out in some detail that it made and continues to hold an investment in
the renewable sector in Spain by indirectly holding shares. With regard to the Wind

subsector it indirectly owns the Wind Farms. With regard to the CSP subsector it indirectly
owns the CSP Plants.*4°

535 The Claimant points out that it made and continues to hold an investment under Article
1(6) ECT by holding “shares, stock, or other forms of equity participation in a company
or business enterprise”. Article 1(6) makes no mention of an investment in “an objective
and ordinary sense” nor does it require the assumption of risk or the contribution of
monetary funds or resources. The only requirement is that the investment be owned or
controlled by the investor. Therefore, the Wind Farms and the CSP Plants qualify as an
investment protected by the ECT.*4”

536 Relying on previous cases that address the interpretation of Article 1(6) ECT,** the
Claimant states that the Respondent’s construction of the term “Jnvestment” under the ECT
amounts to an inadmissible attempt to add requirements that are not present in Article
1(6) 5

537. The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s assertion that under Article 1(6) ECT only the
ultimate owner can claim indirect ownership of an investment. The consequence of this
theory would be that investments held by companies would never be protected by the ECT
because the ultimate owners of the investment are the shareholders. The ECT does not
restrict protection to the beneficial or ultimate owner.>°°

538 In addition, it is the Claimant’s position that it also made and continues to hold an
investment under Article 25(1) ICSID Convention. It rejects the Respondent’s attempt to
present the criteria for the existence of an investment listed in Salini v. Morocco”! as
mandatory legal requirements. These criteria, the Claimant argues, are merely typical
features or characteristics. In any case, the Claimant’s investment clearly meets the Salini
test. It involves a contribution, which need not be made in the form of money, and involves
substantial risk.>?

539 The Claimant also refutes the Respondent’s allegation that, as a shell company without any
business activity, it does not qualify as an investor. Article 1(7) ECT only requires
incorporation under the laws of a Contracting Party. It is impermissible to read additional
requirements into the ECT’s text. Therefore, the allegation of a shell company is irrelevant

and, moreover, factually wrong. The Claimant is incorporated in Luxembourg and hence
qualifies as an investor under Article 1(7) ECT.**

Article 17(1) ECT, providing for a denial of benefits where an investor is owned or
controlled by a non-ECT national, presupposes protection unless the host State exercises
its right under this clause. If Respondent’s reading of Article 1(7) were correct,
Article 17(1) would be pointless.***

The Claimant also points out that it was incorporated in Luxembourg and had invested in
Spain well before the Disputed Measures were enacted or were even foreseeable. The
incorporation of the Claimant had nothing to do with an alleged strategy to submit the
present dispute to arbitration under the ECT. Therefore, no abuse of law can be asserted in
this case since the restructuring was a bona fide economic investment.>>

The Claimant’s Answer to the Tribunal’s Questions in Procedural Order No. 13, submitted
on the same date as Respondent’s Answer,>°° points out that an investor may acquire the
ownership and control of an investment through a variety of means. The Claimant lists its
indirect shareholding interest in the SPVs. This indirect ownership of shares and
subordinated loans matches the criteria for an investment in the ECT as well as the ICSID
Convention.>*” In the Claimant’s words:

 

As s Article 1(6) of the ECT is concerned, the Claimant’s investments fall within the concept
of ‘every kind of asset (...) owned or controlled (...) indirectly’ as a form of ‘shares, stock, or
other forms of equity participation in a company or business enterprise’ with the economic goal
to develop an ‘Economic Activity in the Energy Sector’. Likewise, they comply with the wide
concept of ‘investment’ set out in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.***

 

Any other criterion, such as the origin of the Claimant’s funds, would be irrelevant.>°?
The Claimant contests the applicability of the Salini criteria. At the same time, it asserts
that these would be met in any case: the Claimant has made substantial contributions by
way of share purchases, contributions in kind, equity and loans. Renergy acquired its
indirect investment in the Wind Farms and the CSP Plants as a result of these. The
renewable projects were long-standing. The Claimant assumed significant risk. And it
made an unquestionable contribution to the host State’s development.>°

For the Claimant it follows that there is no doubt that it made an investment both under the
terms of Article 1(6) ECT and Article 25(1) ICSID Convention.**!

The Claimant offers detailed tables tracing the acquisition of the Wind Farms and CSP
Plants. These demonstrate that the Claimant acquired the ownership of its investment in
the Wind Farms and CSP Plants through a repositioning of assets among companies of the
same group.°°

The Claimant finds the Award in KT Asia v. Kazakhstan irrelevant for the present
arbitration. The differences between the two cases stem from the fraudulent context
surrounding the investment in KT Asia v. Kazakhstan, from the fact that the activities of
the investors were different and from the inappropriately strict application of the Salini test
in KT Asia v. Kazakhstan3°

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Parties agree that both the ECT and the ICSID Convention require the existence of an
investment. The criteria for the existence of an investment under these two documents are
not necessarily identical and must be examined separately.

The ECT, in its definition of the term “Jnvestment” in Article 1(6), states in relevant part:

(6) ‘Investment’ means every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an
Investor and includes:

 

]

 

(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity participation in
a.company or business enterprise, and bonds and other debt of a company or business enterpris

   

This definition squarely covers the Claimant’s assets in the renewable sector.

Article 1(6) ECT requires that these assets be “owned or controlled directly or indirectly

by an Investor”. It is undisputed that the Claimant indirectly owns shares of the SPVs that

own the Wind Farms and the CSP Plants.

The ECT, in its definition if the term “/nvestor” in Article 1(7), states in relevant part:
“(7) ‘Investor’ means:

(a) with respect to a Contracting Party:

 

(ii) a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in
that Contracting Party;””

It is undisputed that the Claimant is organized in accordance with the law of Luxembourg,
a Contracting Party of the ECT. It follows that the assets in question meet the requirements

560

of the ECT for the existence of an investment owned or controlled directly or indirectly by
an investor.

The Respondent’s call for additional requirements finds no support in the text of the ECT.
Article 1(6) leaves no room for an “objective definition of investment” as suggested by the
Respondent. Article 1(6) is inclusive speaking of “every kind of asset” without limitation.

Also, the argument that the Claimant is not the real investor in an economic sense and does
not truly control the investment is to no avail. Under Article 1(6) ECT, the only required
relationship between investor and investment is ownership or control. There is no need for
the investor to have played an active role in the making of the investment. Nor is there a
need for the investor to be the ultimate owner or controller.

The Respondent’s complaint about the Claimant being a “shell company” does not affect
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Article 1(7)(a)(ii) ECT uses organization under the law of a
Contracting Party as the only criterion for the existence of a corporate investor. Unlike
other treaties that require a “real economic activity” in the home State, the ECT does not
exclude “shell companies” whose only function is to hold the shares of other companies.

In RREEF vy. Spain the tribunal rejected a similarly worded objection in the following
terms:

    

The term ‘shell company’ is often used as a short-hand reference to a commercial entity that has
little or no activity apart from owning or controlling directly or indirectly assets. Unless there
a reason under the relevant municipal law or investment treaty to conclude otherwise, there is
no basis under international law to accord such a commercial entity any less entitlement to the
protections afforded under an investment treaty than any other commercial entity. There are
examples of investment treaties that include within the definition of investor only commercial
entities that can demonstrate certain characteristics or activities. There is no such limitation in
the ECT or the ICSID Convention. It would not be proper to read such an artificial limitation
into the plain meaning of the ECT, the ICSID Convention or into international law generally.“

 

 

 

The Tribunal’s task is to apply the ECT, not to rewrite it. In the words of the Yukos tribunal:

The Tribunal cannot in effect impose upon the parties a definition of ‘Investment’ other than
that which the parties to the ECT, including Respondent, have agreed.*°*

The Parties disagree on the appropriate test for the determination of an investment under
the ICSID Convention. Article 25(1) ICSID Convention requires the existence of an
“investment” but does not does not offer a definition.

In Salini vy. Morocco, the tribunal said:

 

s: contributions, a certain duration of
of the transaction [reference omitted].

The doctrine generally considers that investment infer
performance of the contract and a participation in the ri

In reading the Convention’s preamble, one may add the contribution to the economic
566

development of the host State of the investment as an additional condition.°

561 Numerous tribunals have since grappled with a definition or description of the term

“investment” in Article 25(1) ICSID Convention, often with the help of these so-called

Salini criteria.°®’ The Parties disagree on the legal nature of the Salini test. The Respondent

sees it as a list of jurisdictional requirements whereas the Claimant regards it as merely
descriptive of typical characteristics.

562 The Tribunal agrees with the position that the Salini criteria should not be seen as distinct
jurisdictional requirements each of which must be met separately to establish jurisdiction
but rather as a descriptive list of typical features of an investment. This does not make these
criteria legally irrelevant. An economic operation that meets them enjoys the presumption
that it is an investment for purposes of the ICSID Convention.

563 In the present case the Tribunal need not enter into a deeper debate about the nature of the
Salini test for two reasons.

564 First, the assets under dispute clearly meet the Salini criteria. The Wind Farms and the CSP
Plants as well as Claimant’s indirect shareholding and loan participation in them are
contributions to Spain’s economy. These investments are designed for a period of at least
25 years and involve substantial risk as evidenced by the present dispute. Moreover, they
have the potential to contribute to Spain’s economic and social development.

565 Secondly, the Respondent’s argument based upon the Salini test does not address the
question whether there has been a contribution but rather who made the contribution. In
other words, the Respondent’s complaint is not about the existence of an investment but
about the role of the Claimant in its acquisition. The Salini test, however, relates to the
existence of an investment and not to the role of the investor. The test offered by the Salini
criteria is not helpful for determining whether the Claimant is the right claimant in the
present case.

566 The Respondent’s discussion of the Claimant’s role in the investment raises three
questions:

 

  

(i) Is mere ownership of the investment sufficient to satisfy the role of an investor or
is there a need for an active role in the making of the investment?

(ii) Is the origin of funds used for the acquisition of assets relevant for the existence
of an investment?

(iii) Did the establishment of the Claimant in Luxembourg involve improper forum
shopping?

As to the first of these three questions, the Respondent’s complaint about the absence of an
active role in the investment by the Claimant has not led to a discussion of the relevant
authorities by either Party.

Some tribunals have indeed required that, in order to be recognized as an investor, a
claimant must have played an active role in the making of the investment. In some of these
cases, the argument that an active role is required was based on wording like “investment
made”, “investment by” or “investments of’ an investor in the relevant treaties.* To the
extent that the reasoning is based on the specific wording of other treaties, it is not relevant
to the present case, which is based on the ECT. As discussed above, Article 1(6) ECT
provides that the investment must be owned or controlled by the investor, but contains no
indication that the investor must have played an active role in its making.

In other cases, tribunals indicated that an investor had to be more than the formal owner of
the investment and had to be engaged with the allocation of resources in order to enjoy
protection.

In KT Asia v. Kazakhstan, relied upon by the Respondent, the claimant had received shares
for no consideration to hold them for a few weeks pending their sale. The transaction had
consisted of a transfer of shares in a Kazakh bank between two foreign companies that
belonged to the same individual. The Tribunal denied that the operation involved an
internal group restructuring since there had been no corporate group as understood in
corporate and tax law. A corporate group operates as a single economic entity with a
common objective and group management. Instead, there was an aggregation of assets in
the form of a large number of companies the purpose of which was to conceal the common
ownership by the controlling individual from the Kazakh authorities. Since KT Asia had
made no contribution, it had not demonstrated the existence of an investment under Article
25(1) ICSID Convention and under the BIT.>”° The Tribunal found confirmation in the fact
that the transaction was not meant to have a longer term duration than a few weeks.*”!

In a larger number of cases, tribunals have rejected the suggestion that the current owner
of assets must have made an active contribution to qualify as an investor. In several cases
tribunals have held that the acquisition of the assets was sufficient.*”? In Levy v. Peru a

father had transferred shares to his daughter free of charge. Peru argued that the resulting
share ownership did not amount to an investment. The Tribunal disagreed:

It is clear that the Claimant acquired her rights and shares free of charge. However, this does not
mean that the persons from whom she acquired these shares and rights did not previously make
very considerable investments of which ownership was transmitted to the Claimant by perfectly
legitimate legal instruments.*”*

 

572 Inasimilar way, tribunals have recognized assets acquired through corporate restructuring
as valid investments and the current holders of these assets as investors. In Gold Reserve
v. Venezuela, Article I(g) of the Canada-Venezuela BIT spoke of “any enterprise [...] who
makes the investment in the territory of Venezuela”. The question was whether assets
acquired as a consequence of corporate restructuring constituted an “investment”.
Venezuela argued that the claimant cannot be said to have made the investment since the
investment already existed before the claimant’s incorporation in Canada.“ The Tribunal
rejected Venezuela’s argument that the claimant had not “made” the investment*”> and
said:

there is no support in previous cases for contentions pertaining to a lack of investment as a result
of (1) the parent company entering the structure after the conc nn had been granted; (2) the
parent company being inserted as a result of an internal corporate restructure; or (3) the new
parent company being incorporated in a jurisdiction with a BIT which has previous
relevant. Therefore, provided that the corporate restructure or investment transfer
for improper purposes (for example, to gain treaty protection after the dispute had arisen), then
the fact that it occurred after the concession had been granted does not affect jurisdiction.°”°

 

 

 
  

573 In MNSS B.V. and Recupero Credito Acciaio N.V. v. Montenegro the question was whether
the assignee of a loan could be regarded as an investor. The respondent disputed that the
second claimant (RCA) had made an investment because it merely passively owned a loan.
Several provisions of the Netherlands-Yugoslavia BIT referred to an investment
“made” 5"" The Tribunal said:

“The fact that RCA was not an active investor because of the activity connotation of the
expression ‘making an investment,’ as argued by the Respondent, does not mean that an investor,
once a loan is made or equity in a company is acquired, needs to make further investments or be
particularly active in the management of the investment.”*”*

In KIM v. Uzbekistan, the Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan BIT referred to “property rights invested
by the investors” (Article 1(2)) and to “investments made by him or her” (Article 10). The
Tribunal rejected a distinction between active and passive investors and said:

the BIT in this case does not contain a distinction between active and passive investors requiring
the former.°

 

These cases demonstrate that much of the discussion surrounding the need for an active
role of an investor in the making of the investment is based on specific wording in
applicable treaties. The ECT’s reference to assets “owned or controlled” does not lend
itself to a restrictive interpretation in this regard.

There is also little support for the idea that an active role of the current holder of an
investment is inherent in the concept of “investment” in Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention. The majority of the authorities addressing this issue conclude that ownership
or control of an investment will suffice even without specific wording to this effect. It
follows that, both under the ECT and under the ICSID Convention, an active contribution
by the current owner of the assets is not required to fulfil the requirement for an investment.
This result is in line with the exigencies of contemporary investment law. It enables the
protection of shareholding, an accepted form of investment. It prevents an existing
investment from losing that quality if transferred to another person whether through
corporate restructuring or otherwise.

With respect of the second question formulated in [566 supra, the Respondent complains
that Claimant did not invest any of its own assets. Rather, the acquisition of the shares was
entirely funded by Mr. Gomez.

Tribunals have held in numerous cases that the origin of the funds invested was not relevant
to the existence of an investment. Most often this argument was used to question the
international nature of the investment. For instance, in Tokios Tokelés v. Ukraine, the
Respondent argued that there was no protected investment, since the capital invested did
not originate outside the Ukraine. The Tribunal noted that neither the ICSID Convention
nor the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT contained a requirement that capital used by an investor
should originate in its State of nationality or indeed originate outside the host State.**° The
Tribunal said:

“The origin of the capital used to acquire these assets is not relevant to the question of
jurisdiction under the Convention.”

In Eiser v. Spain, the Respondent contended that the funds invested did not come from the
investor. The Tribunal found the origin of invested capital irrelevant:

Respondent urged that the funds invested were not the Claimants’ own, and were derived from.
the limited partners in EGIF. However, the origins of capital invested by an Investor in an
Investment are not relevant for purposes of jurisdiction.***

In Gavrilovié v. Croatia, the respondent contested the existence of an investment since the
claimant had not used his own funds to make the investment. The Tribunal rejected this
argument:

  

the source of the funds that Mr Gavrilovié used to purchase the Five Companies is not relevant
to whether Mr Gavrilovié is an investor who made an investment. There is no requirement under
the BIT, the ICSID Convention, international law, or otherwise that a prospective investor must
use his or her personal funds in order to be found to have made a contribution that qualifie:
an investment.**

 

  

   

It follows from the above authorities that, unless specifically provided, the origin of the
funds expended for the acquisition of an investment is irrelevant for purposes of
determining whether a tribunal has jurisdiction. Whether the investment is made from the
investor’s own capital or capital put at the investor’s disposal, whether it is made from
imported funds or from funds raised locally, makes no difference. For purposes of the ECT
and the ICSID Convention, an investment is a foreign investment if it is owned or
controlled by a foreign investor.

 

Regarding the third question identified in [566 supra, the Claimant points out that its
incorporation in Luxembourg and investment in Spain did not involve impermissible forum
shopping or other abuse of right.

The standard for impermissible nationality planning or treaty shopping has been succinctly
summarized by the Tribunal in Levy and Gremcitel v. Peru in the following terms:

 

184. In the Tribunal’s view, it is now well-established, and rightly so, that an organization or
reorganization of a corporate structure designed to obtain investment treaty benefits is not
illegitimate per se, including where this is done with a view to shielding the investment from
possible future disputes with the host state. [...]

 

 

185. However, a restructuring carried out with the intention to invoke the treaty’s protections at
a time when the dispute is foreseeable may constitute an abuse of process depending on the
circumstances. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the test suggested in Pac Rim whereby
‘a specific future dispute’ must be ‘foresee[able] [...] as a very high probability and not merely
as a possible controversy’. In the Tribunal’s view, this test strikes a fair balance between the
need to safeguard an investor’s right to invoke a BIT’s protection in the context of a legitimate
corporate restructuring and the need to deny protection to abusive conduct.**+

 

     

The Tribunal notes that the Claimant was incorporated in Luxembourg on 5 November
2007. It acquired its indirect shareholding in the Wind Farms in 2007 and 2009 with
subsequent capital increases in 2010 and 2011. Claimant acquired its indirect shareholding

in the CSP Plants between 2007 and 2011 with subsequent capital increases in 2009 to
2013. The first measures taken by Respondent that are the object of the present dispute
were enacted in late 2012 followed by further measures in the course of 2013 and 2014.

585 The sequence of events in the present case would make implausible any suggestion that the
Claimant was established and acquired its investment with a view to enable it to bring the
present dispute to arbitration under the ECT. The Tribunal cannot identify any
impermissible forum shopping or abuse of right.

586 It follows that this final objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction must likewise be rejected.

VI. APPLICABLE LAW

587 The Respondent argues that in addition to the provisions of the ECT itself, EU law applies
as international law pursuant to Article 26(6) ECT.** By contrast, the Claimant submits
that EU law does not apply as it is to be regarded as internal law of the Respondent.**°

588 The Tribunal finds that it does not fall to be decided whether EU law forms part of the law
applicable to the merits. The only rules of EU law that the Respondent seeks to apply in
this case are the EU State Aid Rules, specifically Article 108(3) TFEU.**’ Indeed, the
Tribunal agrees that these are the only rules of EU law that could potentially be relevant to
the merits of this case. However, even if one accepted that, in principle, EU law were
applicable to the merits of this dispute pursuant to Article 26(6) ECT, the Tribunal finds
that in accordance with Article 16(2) ECT, the EU State Aid Rules could not be applied in
any case.

589 Pursuant to the conflict of laws rule in Article 16(2) ECT, applicable rules and principles
of international law shall not operate to derogate from any provision of Part III of the ECT,
where such ECT provision is more favourable to the investor or the investment. Neither
Party asserts that the EU State Aid Rules are more favourable to the investor or the
investment than Part III of the ECT, and the Tribunal agrees they are not. To the contrary,
the Respondent invokes the EU State Aid Rules precisely for the very purpose of
preventing the Claimant from enjoying protection under Part III of the ECT.*** The

985 RjoM, 41395. In RC on BayWa, {{39-84, the Respondent also relied on Article 38 of the Statute of the International
Court of Justice.

586 See C-OS, slides 248, 259-261; the Respondent does not seem to dispute that EU law forms part of its internal law,
but rather argues that it is, at the same time, international law (and a relevant fact), due to the “triple nature” of EU
law, see the dent’s powerpoint i dent’s Opening Grounds on the Merits”, as
presented at the Hearing (“R-OS (Merits)”), slide 4, referring to Electrabel v. Hungary I, W4.117E.

°87 Other aspects of EU law are invoked by the Respondent only as factual backdrop, in particular Directive
2001/77/EC, on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market
(RL-0018); Directive 2003/54/EC, on common rules for the internal electricity market (RL-0019); Directive
2009/28/EC, on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (RL-0046).

°88 If it were not entitled to such protection even under the ECT alone, the question of whether the less favourable EU
State Aid Rules apply would of course be moot.

125

Tribunal finds that Article 16(2) ECT is an insurmountable obstacle to this suggested
application of the EU State Aid Rules.**?

590 As there are no other rules of EU law whose application would appear to have, or is
suggested by the Parties to have, any relevance to the outcome of this case on the merits,
the Tribunal does not need to take a position on the general applicability of EU law pursuant
to Article 26(6) ECT.

591 In addition, and for the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal notes that it has no hesitation in
finding that EU law can and must be taken into account as a relevant fact.> After all, it is
undisputed that EU law is an integral part of the Respondent’s internal legal system within
which the Claimant invested. As such, it is just as (potentially) relevant as any and all other
circumstances shaping the environment in which the investment was made. Neither Party
argues, nor does the Tribunal find that, it would make any material difference in this case
if, in addition to considering EU law as a fact, EU law also formed part of the applicable
law.

VII. RESPONSIBILITY

A. Fair and Equitable Treatment

1. Applicable Standard

a. The Claimant’s Principal Arguments

592 The Claimant submits that the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) provided
for in Article 10(1) ECT is the “Grundnorm” of the protection of foreign investments,
which is autonomous from and goes beyond the minimum standard of treatment of
customary international law (“MST”).*! In particular, according to the Claimant, the FET
standard encompasses the protection of legitimate expectations and an obligation of the
State to act transparently, to accord due process and to refrain from arbitrary actions.>”?

The Claimant further asserts that the “stable [...] conditions” required by Article 10(1) of
the ECT form part of the FET standard.*”*

With respect to the Respondent’s argument that FET is essentially limited to the guarantees
of non-discrimination and MST, the Claimant contends that this position lacks any support
in the ECT, in case-law and in scholarly writing.*”* In addition, the Claimant argues that
such interpretation would render the FET standard superfluous, given that non-
discrimination and MST are already expressly guaranteed by the third and fourth sentence
of Article 10(1) ECT, which is further strengthened by Articles 10(3) and 10(7) ECT in
respect of national treatment and MEN treatment.*?°

The Respondent’s Principal Arguments

Based mainly on the reference in Title I of the European Energy Charter™® to the “principle
of non-discrimination” and the ECT’s objective to achieve a free energy market between
Western Europe and former Soviet Republics, the Respondent argues that the main thrust
of the FET standard is to protect investors against discrimination based on their
nationality.*°’ The Respondent claims that this is supported also by the ECT Reader’s
Guide.>**

However, according to the Respondent, the ECT does not fully achieve this non-
discrimination objective, due to the States’ reluctance to limit their regulatory powers. In
particular, the Respondent submits that in respect of the process of the making of the
investment, the ECT merely contains a “best efforts” commitment to accord to investors of
other Contracting States the better of national treatment or MFN treatment, as per Articles
10(2) and 10(3) ECT. The Respondent asserts that the FET standard, in particular the
second sentence of Article 10(1) ECT, form part of this mere “soft Jaw” that applies in the
stage of the making of the investment.” After the making of the investment, in the
Respondent’s view, the protection is limited to national treatment, with international law
setting the minimum standard, as is reflected in the third sentence of Article 10(1) ECT as
well as in Article 10(7) ECT.°

In addition, the Respondent invokes Article 10(8) ECT, pursuant to which the modalities
of applying Article 10(7) ECT to “programmes under which a Contracting Party provides
grants or other financial assistance” are left for a supplementary treaty. The Respondent
asserts that 85.8% of the remuneration received by renewable energy producers in Spain
consist of subsidies, and that the exception provided for in Article 10(8) ECT therefore
applies to the present case. Given that the supplementary treaty referred to in Article 10(8)

ECT has not been signed thus far, the Respondent contends that there is not yet any
obligation for Contracting States to accord national treatment to foreign investors in
relation to subsidies.®!

The Tribunal’s Analysis

Article 10(1) ECT provides, in relevant part, as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and
create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting
Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord
at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment.
Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no Contracting
Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded
treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including treaty obligations.

 

 

 

As accepted by both Parties,°” the interpretation of Article 10(1) ECT is governed by the

VCLT, in particular the general rule of interpretation codified in Article 31(1) thereof,
pursuant to which

A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given
to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.

First of all, based on these principles of interpretation, the Tribunal dismisses the
Respondent’s argument that the FET standard applies only to the process of the “Making
of the Investment”, whereas allegedly it does not apply thereafter. In the Tribunal’s view,
this argument is irreconcilable with the ordinary meaning of the term “at all times” in the
second sentence of Article 10(1) ECT,®” which the Tribunal finds is the main provision
from which the ECT’s FET standard derives.

Contrary to the Respondent’s contention, nothing else follows from the context. To begin
with, while it is true that the term “[s]uch conditions” at the beginning of the second
sentence of Article 10(1) ECT ties back to the first sentence, the Tribunal is not convinced
that the first sentence, as claimed by the Respondent, applies only to the establishing of the
investment, but not to subsequent stages. The Tribunal notes that the first sentence does
not use the defined term “Make Investments”, which indeed refers to the “establishing [of]
new Investments” (Article 1(8) ECT), but rather uses the uncapitalized und thus undefined
term “make”; there is no indication that this was an accident, much less since Article 10(2)
ECT does use the defined term “Making of Investments”. In addition, even if one
considered that the non-capitalization of the term “make” in the first sentence of Article

01 CMoM, 991710-712.

. Spain, $426. The tribunal in Blusun v. Italy, 4319(2) at least expanded the scope to

subsequent “extensions of the investment as well as changes of form”.

128

602

603

604

605

10(1) ECT were a clerical mistake, the second sentence with its clear wording “at all times”
would anyway extend the protection to all stages of the investment.°°

Equally, the Tribunal fails to see how the object and purpose of the ECT could modify the
ordinary meaning to be given to the term “at all times”. Even if one accepted the
Respondent’s case that the object and purpose of the ECT is merely to prevent
discrimination on the basis of nationality, this would be no reason to limit the temporal
scope of the FET standard to the “Making of the Investment”.

Secondly, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondent’s submission that the FET standard
is mere “soft law”. The second sentence of Article 10(1) ECT —as, in fact, all sentences of
this provision — is clearly cast in mandatory terms (“shall”) and, thus, is not merely
hortatory in nature.°°”

Thirdly, the Tribunal does not endorse the Respondent’s argument that the ECT’s FET
standard is limited to national treatment, MFN treatment and/or MST. The Tribunal agrees
in this respect with Infrared v. Spain:

The clear language of Article 10(1) ECT belies such an interpretation. So too does what might
fairly be called a jurisprudence constante that is based on the understanding shared by the
Tribunal to the effect that the FET obligation is a inct standard linked (among others) to the
legitimate expectations of investors as assessed on the facts of each case.

 

In particular, the ordinary meaning of “fair and equitable treatment” and “stable, equitable,
favourable and transparent conditions” does not imply any limitation to national treatment,
MEN treatment or MST. Quite the contrary: The context, namely the separate protection
against non-discrimination in the third sentence of Article 10(1) ECT, the guarantee of
MST in the fourth sentence of Article 10(1) ECT, and the guarantee of national treatment
and MEN treatment in Article 10(3) and (7) ECT strongly support the conclusion that the
FET standard must go beyond those protections. For the same reason, the Respondent’s
argument based on Article 10(8) ECT does not help the Respondent’s case because said
Article refers to the modalities of national treatment and MEN treatment only, not to FET.

Fourthly, in respect of the legal standard to apply when determining whether the FET
standard is violated, the Tribunal agrees with RWE Innogy v. Spain that

 

reference to dictionary definitions scarcely helps it in interpreting the formula ‘fair and
equitable.’ The terms ‘fair’ and ‘equitable’ are not in any event particularly difficult to
understand as a matter of ordinary meaning: the difficulty, as is very well-known, is how and
where to draw the line between what is fair / unfair, equitable / inequitable, in particular in the
context of a State’s adoption of regulations of general application.

606 Similarly, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to revisit the long line of case-law in
which investment tribunals have offered definitions of the FET standard.°!° For the
purposes of deciding the present case, it suffices to say that the Tribunal endorses, at least
as a matter of principle, the well-established line of jurisprudence under which the ECT’s
FET standard offers protection, inter alia, against a violation of legitimate expectations,
lack of transparency, lack of due process, and arbitrariness.°!!

607 The Tribunal does not need to take a position on whether the foregoing protections are
independent (sub-)standards or whether they merely describe types of conduct that
typically conflict with fairness and equity and are, therefore, likely to violate the FET
standard. As the Parties pleaded separately on those protections, the Tribunal will deal with
them separately below.°!? However, the Tribunal (by majority, with Arbitrator Sands
dissenting) wishes to highlight already at this point that based on the facts of this case, the
Tribunal does not find that the aspects of transparency, due process or arbitrariness provide
any additional protection to the Claimant as compared to the protection of its legitimate
expectations.

608 As mentioned above, the difficulty lies not in the abstract definition of what is fair and
equitable, but rather in determining whether a State’s conduct in an individual case falls
afoul of the FET standard. As a matter of course, this question cannot be answered in the
abstract, but only with due regard to all relevant circumstances surrounding such
conduct.*!? Moreover, there can be no doubt that answering this question requires a
balancing exercise, as follows not only from the very concepts of fairness and equity
themselves but also from the object and purpose of the ECT.*!* Specifically, in cases such
as the present one, where the propriety of legislative change lies at the heart of the dispute,
the Tribunal must balance the host State’s undisputed right to regulate with legitimate
interests of an investor who committed resources on the basis of the earlier legal regime.®!*

609 In the framework of this balancing exercise, the Tribunal (by majority, with Arbitrator
Sands dissenting) considers that it must also take into account the particular importance
attached by the ECT to the concept of stability.°'© This emphasis on stability follows from

610 To same effect RREEF v. Spain II, 4260; BayWa v. Spain, 9457, the latter with many references to arbitral case-
law.

260; Operafund v. Spain, 524. Outside the ECT context, see, in particular, Micula v. Romania, (522, 528f., 533.
612 Similarly, as the Parties’ pleadings treated the standards of most constant protection and security and non-
imparment as separate from the FET standard, the Tribunal’s analysis follows this structure, without this being a
statement on whether those standards are part and parcel of the FET standard.

613 See, e.g., Mondev International Limited v. United States of America, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award,
11 October 2002, (118; Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award,

the ordinary meaning of the term “stable [...] conditions” in the first sentence of Article
10(1) ECT, in light also of the stated objective of long-term cooperation in Article 2 ECT,
which in turn suggests that the ECT is conceived as enhancing the stability required for
such cooperation.°!” Further confirmation derives from the objectives and principles of the
European Energy Charter, as referred to in Article 2 ECT, whereby cooperation in the
energy field entails and signatories “will [...] provide for a stable [...] legal framework” §'®

610 However, once again, the Tribunal (by majority, with Arbitrator Sands dissenting) does not
find it necessary to take a position on whether the guarantee of “stable [...] conditions”
constitutes a separate standard or is an element to be taken into account in the framework
of the FET standard. The Tribunal does not believe that the different approaches would
result in different outcomes.*!? Therefore, the Tribunal (by majority, with Arbitrator Sands
dissenting) finds it most appropriate to treat the guarantee of “stable [...] conditions” in its
analysis as it was presented by the Claimant, namely as an aspect of the FET standard.

2. Violation of Legitimate Expectations
a. Applicable Test

611 — It is widely recognized in arbitral jurisprudence that a core element of the FET standard in
Article 10(1) ECT is the protection of the investor’s legitimate expectations.?! The test
applied by tribunals to determine whether a State thwarted legitimate expectations varies.
However, to the Tribunal, this seems to be more a result of different terminology than of
any disagreement on substance. Indeed, the Tribunal considers that the findings of many
other tribunals®? are consistent with an approach that raises the following questions, which
the Tribunal considers to be pertinent in this case:

(i) Did the host State act in a way that, at the time the investment was made, gave
rise to legitimate expectations on the part of investors?

©" iser v. Spain, 4378; Antin v. Spain, 4520, 533.

618 European Energy Charter (RL-0040), Title 1.2 and Title 4.

619 In other words, if the Tribunal were to treat the requirement of “stable [...] conditions” as independent from the
FET standard (or at least from the protection of legitimate expectations), the Tribunal would find (by majority, with
Arbitrator Sands dissenting) that the Respondent failed to provide stable conditions, for the reasons set out in section
VILA.2.d.iii below.

(ii) Did the investor in question place reliance on those expectations when making its
investment?

(iii) Did the host State frustrate those expectations with its subsequent behaviour?

612 It appears that this approach is also accepted by both Parties.°°? Likewise, it appears
undisputed, and the Tribunal finds, that it is the Claimant who bears the burden of proving
that all elements of the test are met.°* In the following subsections b. to d., the Tribunal
will analyse in turn whether the Claimant met its burden of proof.

b. Legitimate Expectations Created by the Respondent
i. The Claimant’s Principal Arguments

613 The Claimant submits that legitimate expectations are created when a State’s conduct is
such that an investor may reasonably rely on that conduct as being consistent.*° According
to the Claimant, legitimate expectations may be engendered through commitments,
promises or assurances attributable to competent organs or representatives of the host State,
irrespective of whether they were explicit, implicit, general or specific.°°° However, the
Claimant acknowledges that the form, content, clarity and specificity of the commitments,
promises or assurances determine the degree to which the host State is limited in its
subsequent behaviour.’ That said, the Claimant avers that specific representations are not
indispensable for a legitimate expectations claim.°* At the same time, however, the
Claimant seems to acknowledge that in the absence of any clear and specific
representations, laws may be changed to the detriment of existing investments.°”?

614 The Claimant argues that legitimate expectations can also be engendered by domestic
legislation.°*° In particular, the Claimant contends that the existence and maintenance of a
stable and consistent regulatory framework is directly linked to investors’ legitimate
expectations, meaning that investors are entitled to expect that the regulatory framework

623

 

The Claimant effectively applied this approach in its submissions, see MoM, headings of sections X.2.2, X.2.3,
X.2.4; C-PHB, 135, 151 (in 136, the Claimant only takes issue with a further-reaching finding by the Mobil v.
Canada tribunal, which Claimant argues cannot apply in an ECT context). The Respondent, in R-PHB, (139, relies
on Antaris v. Czech Republic, 1360(3), which follows an approach that is identical in substance; in RjoM, {1 129, the
Respondent further relies on Invesmart, B.V. v. Czech Republic, UNCITRAL, Award, 26 June 2009 (RL-0101)
(“Invesmart v. Czech Republic”), §{250-258, which also applies a similar approach.

will remain stable and consistent.®*! In the Claimant’s view, this is true all the more in the
context of the ECT, given the explicit reference to “stable [...] conditions” in Article 10(1)
ECT.&2

615 Equally as a result of this express requirement of stability, the Claimant submits that one
cannot adopt under the ECT the view taken by other tribunals based on certain BITs,
namely that host States are not required to elevate the interests of the investors above other
considerations. In the Claimant’s view, the first sentence of Article 10(1) ECT does give
prevalence to investors’ interests over other competing interests.** In addition, the
Claimant submits that the right to regulate is not unfettered, and Article 10(1) ECT
prohibits drastic or abrupt revisions of the legal regime upon which the investment
depended.**

616 As to the relevant point in time for assessing the creation of legitimate expectations, the
Claimant argues that while legitimate expectations must rest on the conditions as they exist
at the time of the investment, investments are often a process rather than instantaneous
acts.*° With respect to the Wind Farms, the Claimant’s position is that the investment
spanned from 6 November 2007 (when the Claimant acquired shares in Condeu) through
22 December 2011 (when the Claimant increased its interest in Dagosa).*° Regarding the
CSP Plants, the Claimant submits that the investment covered the period from
21 November 2007 (when the Claimant acquired a shareholding interest in Iberedlica
Solar) until 26 May 2011 (when the Claimant acquired additional shares in Iberéolica
Solar).°7

617 The Claimant asserts that the Respondent had created the legitimate expectation on the part
of the Claimant that RF1 “would remain stable and consistent over time”.°*® While the
Claimant avers that it does not claim petrification of RF1 but rather the absence of any

“abrupt change”,®? its position is not entirely consistent because elsewhere the Claimant

argues that “any” changes to RF1 would breach the ECT, and its primary damage
calculation is based on a counterfactual in which RF1 remains completely unchanged.™°

In particular, the Claimant contends that the Respondent has created this legitimate
expectation of stability through the following measures:

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

(vi)

The PER 2000 and the PER 2005 proved the Respondent’s commitment to further
develop renewable energies in Spain, even more so because each of them had been
issued by one of the two major Spanish political parties, who were aligned on this
policy objective.™!

RD 661/2007, together with the corresponding press release of 25 May 2007,
contained specific commitments guaranteeing the stability of the remuneration
scheme, in particular by way Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007.°

Article 4(3) and the 4""/5" Transitory Provisions of RDL 6/2009 guaranteed to the
CSP Plants that they would receive the remuneration foreseen by RD 661/2007,
because they were pre-registered on the Remuneration Pre-Allocation Register
and, within 36 months thereof, entered into operation and were finally registered
on the RAIPRE.“

The Resolution of the Council of Ministers of 13 November 2009 (together with
the corresponding press release of the same day) admitted further CSP capacity to
the Special Regime and highlighted the necessity of providing certainty to
promoters of renewable energies, constituting a further guarantee regarding the
stability of the system.

The registration of the Wind Farms and CSP Plants in RAIPRE triggered a
specific right to receive the remuneration foreseen in RD 661/2007, based on
Article 14 of RD 661/2007 and as confirmed by resolutions that were sent by the
Respondent to the CSP SPVs and Wind SPVs confirming their registration.

The 2010 Agreemens, together with the corresponding press release of 2 July
2010, guaranteed the stability of the economic regime in exchange for certain
sacrifices made by the CSP SPVs and Wind SPVs.4°

(vii) RD 1614/2010 (together with the corresponding press release of 3 December
2010) transformed the 2010 Agreements into Spanish law and, thus, guaranteed
the existing economic regime for the CSP Plants and Wind Farms. Specifically,
the Claimant refers to Articles 4 and 5(3) of RD 1614/2010.”

(viii)The Waiver Acceptance Resolutions concerning the CSP Plants, which
guaranteed that the economic regime for the CSP Plants would be maintained for
the remainder of their operational life.™*

Contrary to the Respondent’s argument that the remuneration levels were always subject
to an overriding principle of “reasonable return”, the Claimant submits that the foregoing
measures created the legitimate expectation of receiving the specific revenues set out in
RD 661/2007, as amended by RD 1614/20010, and that the Claimant never understood that
is was guaranteed only a “reasonable return”. In particular, the Claimant dismisses the
Respondent’s suggestion that such a concept of “reasonable return” had a dynamic
character, arguing that the costs for constructing the CSP Plants and Wind Farms are sunk
and do not change even if the same installation can be built for a lesser amount of money
at a later point in time.°°

In response to the Respondent’s allegation that the Claimant could not legitimately expect
any feed-in tariff for the CSP Plants because their installed capacity exceed 50 MW, the
Claimant submits that the Respondent’s attempt to equate the term “installed capacity”
with gross production is unsustainable. While RF1 did not define the term “installed
capacity”, the Claimant asserts that such term is commonly used in the industry to refer to
the capacity that a plant is able to deliver to the grid (net production), which is lower than
the capacity of its generator (gross production) due to the internal consumption and losses
of power within the plant and along the transmission line. The Claimant alleges that both
CSP Plants are designed and operated to deliver no more than a net production of 50 MW
to the grid, and have never collected feed-in remuneration above the 50 MW limitation. In
addition, the Claimant notes that the nameplates of the generators in both CSP Plants,
which nameplates were installed by the supplier of the generators, prove that the installed
capacity does not exceed 50 MW. In addition, the Claimant argues that because feed-in
remuneration under RF1 was applicable solely to net production,®! the term “installed
capacity” could not have referred to anything else. Moreover, the Claimant contends that
the Respondent’s regional authorities interpreted “installed capacity” as referring to net
production because, otherwise, they would not have granted the relevant administrative
authorizations and registered the CSP Plants with the Special Regime. Similarly, even
though the Ministry of Energy was aware that the CSP Plants had a gross capacity of
55 MW, the CSP Plants were nonetheless registered in the Remuneration Pre-Allocation
Registry and RAIPRE. Therefore, the Claimant submits that the Respondent is estopped
from claiming that the CSP Plants did not qualify for the Special Regime based on their

installed capacity. Furthermore, the Claimant asserts that this arbitration is not the proper
forum for the Respondent to dispute the CSP Plants’ compliance with the Special Regime
requirements, given that the necessary commissioning certificates and the admission of the
CSP Plants to the Remuneration Pre-Allocation Registry and RAIPRE are valid
administrative acts under Spanish law, which presuppose that the CSP Plants comply with
the maximum power limit. Those administrative acts could only be rendered ineffective by
the same administrative bodies that issued them or by Spanish administrative courts."

621 Finally, with respect to the Respondent’s State aid argument, the Claimant invokes several
arbitral awards pursuant to which the Respondent’s failure to notify RF1 as State aid did
not preclude legitimate expectations of investors. The Claimant submits that when it
invested, neither the Claimant nor any other investors nor any lawyers, bankers or
engineers considered that RF1 could be unlawful under EU law, in particular in view of
the CJEU’s judgment in PreussenElektra.* The Claimant points out that not even the
Respondent itself nor the EC considered RFI to constitute Staid aid, as evidenced by the
fact that the Respondent never notified RF1 to the EC and that the EC, while fully aware
of RFI, never initiated a procedure on its own motion, as it could have.®> The Claimant
notes that the EC State Aid Decision in fact stated that it was not relevant to assess whether
RFI would have been compatible with RF1.°° The Claimant adds that the EC has not
created a right for the Respondent, much less an obligation, to procure the reimbursement
of amounts of State aid already paid, as it could have.®” Also, the Claimant alleges that
EU law does not limit the subsidies that the CSP Plants and Wind Farms could lawfully
receive to what is granted by the Disputed Measures.°* Moreover, the Claimant argues
that it is entitled to rely on the applicable 10-year limitation period for recovering any
unlawful State aid, which would have expired in 2017, i.e. 10 years after adoption of RD
661/2007.°°

ii. The Respondent’s Principal Arguments

622 The Respondent argues that in accordance with arbitral jurisprudence, the application of
the FET standard allows for a balancing exercise by the host State, and the host State is not

of Mr. Jose Mesa-Diaz, who opines that from an engineering standpoint, the term “installed capacity” is somewhat
ambiguous but must be understood as net energy delivered at the interconnection point with the grid, see ATA CSP

required to elevate the interests of foreign investors above all other considerations in every
circumstance.°

623 The Respondent further submits that the ECT is not an insurance policy against the risk of
changes to the regulatory framework, and does not require host States to freeze their legal
systems for the investor’s benefit, irrespective of Article 10(1) FET referring to “stable
[...] conditions”.°' Instead, the Respondent contends that for an expectation of
petrification to be legitimate, the host State needs to have made a specific commitment to
the investor according to which the legal regime in force will remain unchanged.* The
Respondent argues that the legal regime itself cannot constitute such specific
commitment.

624 In addition, the Respondent points out that in order to be protected under the FET standard,
expectations must be reasonable and objective under the existing regulatory framework,
and thus take into account the knowledge that the investor had or should have had about
the regulatory framework when making the investment. Accordingly, the Respondent
argues that there is an “inexcusable obligation” for every investor to perform a diligent
analysis and to know the regulatory framework affecting the investment, including the
relevant jurisprudence of domestic courts, in particular in a highly regulated sector.

625 With respect to the Wind Farms, the Respondent contends that the relevant point in time
for assessing the Claimant’s legitimate expectations was 2003, when Mr. Gomez paid for
the construction of the Wind Farms. By contrast, according to the Respondent, the
acquisition of Condeu by the Claimant in November 2007 was merely a re-shuffling of
assets that were all wholly owned by Mr. Gomez. In the alternative, the Respondent argues
that the latest point in time for assessing legitimate expectations in respect of the Wind
Farms is November 2007. In relation to the CSP Plants, the Respondent submits that the
relevant point in time is November 2007.°°

626 In the Respondent’s view, the Claimant could not legitimately expect that the remuneration
regime would remain unchanged because the Respondent did not make any specific
commitment to this effect, in particular not in any of the legal instruments or public
statements invoked by the Claimant in this regard.

Specifically, with respect to RD 661/2007, the Respondent argues that Article 44(3) thereof
did not prevent the Respondent from adopting revisions that were necessary to safeguard
the sustainability of the SES or to avoid situations of over-remuneration; instead, the scope
of application of Article 44(3) was limited to the regular, quadrennial revisions of the
Regulated Tariff and the upper and lower limits as foreseen in Article 44.’ As regards the
registration in RAIPRE, the Respondent submits that this merely determined the
applicability of RD 661/2007, but did not guarantee that the tariffs provided for therein
would remain the same.°* With respect to the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of
13 November 2009, the Respondent argues that this Resolution and the underlying reports
in fact emphasized the need to safeguard the sustainability of the SES.° Regarding the
2010 Agreements, the Respondent contends that the involvement of the CSP and wind
sectors did not amount to any agreement in the legal sense of the term, but rather formed
part of a consultation procedure that is a mandatory part of the Spanish legislative
process.°”° As to the Waiver Acceptance Resolutions, the Respondent claims, inter alia,
that as per the plain wording of those documents, they merely communicated the
remuneration that was applicable “at present” to the CSP Plants and Wind Farms, thus not
excluding any subsequent changes.*”!

In addition, the Respondent contends that any investor who analysed the regulatory
framework applicable at the time the Claimant invested should have known that if there
was a situation affecting the sustainability of the SES, changes could and would be made
to the regulatory regime, provided that the principle of reasonable return for investors
would be maintained. In particular, according to the Respondent, this follows from the
normative hierarchy within the Spanish legal system, from the fact that the subsidies under
the Special Regime were subordinate to the economic sustainability of the SES, and that
the cornerstone of the Special Regime has always been the guarantee of a reasonable return,
which has a dynamic character.°””

The Respondent submits that it was also clear from the judgments issued by the Spanish
Supreme Court prior to the Claimant’s investment in 2007 (and thereafter) that the
remunerative regime for renewable energy production could be changed; the Respondent
asserts that the Claimant was aware of those judgments.°”* The Respondent adds that not
only other investors such as the Claimant’s partner in Iberedlica Solar but also the most
relevant interest groups for the wind and CSP sectors were perfectly aware of this
possibility of legislative changes; in fact, Protermosolar even proposed (unsuccessfully) to
include an additional provision into the draft of RD 1614/2010 to the effect that the
Respondent would accept liability if the economic regime were modified to the detriment

57 CMoM, 281-284, 765-769; RjoM, {{[584-616. According to the Respondent, the same applies to Article 4 of RD

of the owner of a facility.°”* In addition, the Respondent highlights the CNE’s report of 14
February 2007, which acknowledged that the protection of legitimate expectations cannot
petrify the legal framework, even for existing installations.°”>

630 Furthermore, the Respondent submits that the energy sector is of a strategic nature and
involves a high degree of regulation and important public interests. In the Respondent’s
view, no diligent investor could have expected the existence of stabilization commitments
in regulations which, by nature, are changing norms.°”®

631 In addition, the Respondent asserts that in respect of the CSP Plants at least, the Claimant
could not have held any legitimate expectations as to benefitting from the Special Regime,
given that one requirement of the Special Regime is that the installed capacity does not
exceed 50 MW. In the Respondent’s view, the term “installed capacity” refers to the CSP
Plants’ nominal power, which undisputedly exceeds 50 MW. The Respondent submits that
it is not estopped from raising this argument because the checks performed by public
authorities on the CSP Plants were limited to verifying the documentation provided and
visiting the plants, whereas no measurement or inspection were carried out.°””

632 Finally, the Respondent argues, and is supported in this regard by the EC,’ that no investor
could have held any legitimate expectations as to receiving any remuneration under RF1
because RF1 constituted illegal State aid, given the Respondent’s failure to notify RF1 to
the EC in accordance with Article 108(3) TFEU.°” The EC submits that this notification
requirement is a fundamental principle of EU law, the violation of which entails the
illegality of any State aid granted without the EC’s authorization.®° Moreover, the EC
asserts that there is longstanding case-law of the CJEU according to which, save in
exceptional circumstances, undertakings cannot legitimately expect that any State aid
granted to them is lawful unless it has been granted in compliance with the procedure laid
down in the TFEU.*! The EC further alleges that arbitral jurisprudence confirms that
assurances contra legem cannot create legitimate expectations.*” In addition, the EC
claims that in accordance with settled arbitral case-law, a measure that does not violate

domestic provisions on legitimate expectations also does not violate the FET standard.**?

Likewise, the EC argues that diligent investors in the EU must be familiar with the EU
State Aid Rules, including the fact that EU Member States have no say in deciding whether
State aid is compatible with EU law, thus rendering any promises or assurances by an EU
Member State about State aid matters incapable of creating any legitimate expectation.***

633 The EC asserts that the findings from the EC State Aid Decision are binding on the Tribunal
when assessing a violation of the substantive protections standards of the ECT.°* These
findings notably include, according to the EC, that investors could not have held any
legitimate expectations, neither under the TFEU nor under the ECT, with respect to RFI,
given the Respondent’s failure to notify it to the EC.°°°

634 In addition, the EC submits that Article 1(3) ECT recognizes that Contracting Parties who
are members of a REIO, such as EU Member States, were signing onto the ECT only in
respect of matters for which they retained competence. The EC argues that the EU Member
States transferred certain competences to the EU and that, therefore, Contracting Parties to
the ECT knew from the beginning that an investor in an EU Member State could acquire
legitimate expectations only if it complied with EU law.°*”

635 Moreover, the EC submits that any arbitral award rendered by this Tribunal would need to
be notified to the EC so that it can assess the compatibility of the State aid granted by the
award with the EU internal market.°*

iii. The Tribunal’s Analysis

636 The Tribunal finds it useful to first set out its view on how to assess the existence of
legitimate expectations before determining which legitimate expectations, if any, the
Respondent created with respect to RF1, i.e. the legal regime under which the Claimant
invested.

(1) | Standard for Assessing Legitimate Expectations

637 There is broad consensus in arbitral jurisprudence, to which the Tribunal subscribes, that
the existence of a legitimate expectation (or expectations) is to be assessed as at the time

when the investment was made.°* If an investment is made in multiple parts on different
dates, the legitimate expectations need to be assessed at each of those dates separately.°”°

638 Moreover, the Tribunal shares the well-established view that the assessment of legitimate
expectations must be an objective one. This has two dimensions. First, it is irrelevant which
intentions the State pursued when carrying out the actions that objectively gave rise to
certain legitimate expectations, in particular whether the State subjectively sought to
commit itself to anything by virtue of those actions.®! Secondly, it is not the subjective
belief of the investor in question that counts.°? Rather, legitimate expectations are those
that a prudent investor would have held.®” Accordingly, in principle, the assessment of
legitimate expectations must be made based on the information that a prudent investor
would have held at the time the investment was made, without appraising the investor’s
expectations with the benefit of hindsight.°* However, if the individual investor in
question was privy to additional information not available to others, this personal
information will likewise be taken into account.®”

639 In addition, the Tribunal finds that, in principle, there is no numerus clausus as to the forms
of State actions that can give rise to legitimate expectations. Accordingly, such
expectations can be engendered by any (explicit or implicit) statements or conduct.°° In
particular, therefore, legitimate expectations do not necessarily require specific
representations by the host State.’ However, in the absence of any clear indication to the
contrary, no State can reasonably be taken to have entered into an investment treaty with
the intention of generally committing to freezing its laws, or for the investment treaty to
serve as a permanent “insurance policy” to the benefit of foreign investors against any

change of the regulatory framework.®” As a consequence, as seems to be accepted by both
Parties,” for an investor to legitimately hold the very particular expectation that the
regulatory framework in force at the time of investment will remain unchanged, the State
needs to have made a specific commitment to that effect.”°!

640 This leads to the question as to which type of State conduct may qualify as a specific
commitment in the foregoing sense. Stabilization clauses in a contractual agreement
between the investor and the host State certainly could amount to a specific commitment,
depending on the particular provision,” but in this case there is no such clause. By
contrast, it is often said that arbitral jurisprudence is incoherent when it comes to the
question of whether general legislation could engender a legitimate expectation that the
regulatory framework will remain unchanged. According to Masdar v. Spain, one school
of thought considers that this is possible, while another school of thought requires
something more than general legislative statements.” However, upon review of the
decisions referred to in Masdar v. Spain in support of this categorization, as well as of other
decisions in which tribunals accepted that general legislation could engender legitimate
expectations, it seems to the Tribunal that the difference between these schools of thought
is quite limited:

(i) The decisions cited by Masdar v. Spain in support of the first school of thought
(general laws may qualify as specific commitments) did not in fact accept as
legitimate the expectation that the laws would not change at all, but merely the
expectation that such changes would not exceed a certain margin.” Exceptions
are the decisions in Operafund v. Spain and 9REN vy. Spain, both issued after
Masdar v. Spain, which qualified a legislative provision as a specific commitment

that prevented the host State from making any changes to the detriment of the
investor.’

(ii) Conversely, those decisions cited by Masdar v. Spain in support of the second
school of thought (general laws do not qualify as specific commitments) merely
ruled that one cannot legitimately expect, based on general laws, that there would
be no legislative change at all.” They do not rule out, however, that general
legislation engenders more limited expectations of stability.

641 Hence, with the exception of Operafund v. Spain and 9REN v. Spain, the prevailing view
seems to be that general legislation cannot engender legitimate expectations in the sense
that no legislative changes could be made at all (hereinafter “Absolute Stability”””).
Indeed, the Tribunal finds this convincing because “a stabilisation commitment made in a
law is just as much subject to change as all the other dispositions of the law in question””®
—as opposed to a stabilization clause in a contract with the investor, which the State could
not change unilaterally, ie. without the investor agreeing.

642 However, the Tribunal (by majority, with Arbitrator Sands dissenting) agrees with the now
well-established arbitral case-law that even in the absence of any specific commitment,
Article 10(1) ECT does protect investors against legislative changes that exceed a (wide)
acceptable margin, i.e. general legislation creates the legitimate expectation that it will not
be subjected to any such changes (hereinafter “Relative Stability”””).’!° Depending on
the language used by the relevant tribunal, this excludes changes that are unreasonable,”!!

suddenly and unexpectedly remove the essential features of the previous regulatory
framework.’ Despite the different language employed, the cases in which those terms
were used do not appear to reveal any significant difference as to the standard applied. In

643 It will now be for the Tribunal to determine, based on the foregoing principles, which
objectively legitimate expectations, if any, the Claimant could have held at the times it
invested. This first requires the Tribunal to deal with the Respondent’s threshold arguments
that there could have been no legitimate expectations in respect to RFI at all, given the EU
State Aid Rules (see section (2) infra), and that in any case no legitimate expectations could

constituted a breach, they did so on the basis of their finding there was a specific commitment of Absolute Stability.
In other words, they did not make a finding on whether those legislative measures exceeded legitimate expectations
of Relative Stability. BayWa v. Spain did not make any finding on RF2 because it was not challenged by the claimant
in that case, see ibid., [590(e). RWE Innogy v. Spain did not expressly say which pieces of legislation it deemed to
violate legitimate expectations, but the effects it took issue with (lower IRR and claw-back) were all introduced by
RF3.

570; however, those three latter tribunals likewise did not seem to apply a substantially different standard, but merely
found that, on the facts before them, the IRR granted by RF3 to the facilities in question was still reasonable. Similarly,
while Isolux v. Spain, {773-815, likewise denied a violation of legitimate expectations, it did accept that legislative
change that was not “foreseeable” could violate legitimate expectations (ibid., 715), and merely denied such
unforeseeability in the case before it, mainly due to the late investment date. Finally, while Stadtwerke Miinchen v.
Spain, 1{263-308, also denied any violation of legitimate expectations, the tribunal in that case does not seem to have
analysed the notion of Relative Stability.

have existed regarding the CSP Plants because their installed capacity allegedly exceeded
50 MW (see section (3) infra). Subsequently, the Tribunal will assess whether any of the
Respondent’s actions invoked by the Claimant engendered a legitimate expectation of
Absolute Stability, as asserted by the Claimant in at least some of its submissions, or
whether the expectation that the Claimant could have legitimately held was more limited,
as argued by the Respondent (see section (4) infra).

(2) The State Aid Argument

As a starting point, the Tribunal finds that it does not need to decide whether payment by
the Respondent of any amount under this award would qualify as State aid. The Tribunal
acknowledges that, if this were the case, such payment would be illegal under the EU State
Aid Rules unless and until the EC authorizes such State aid. However, this would merely
be an obstacle to the enforcement of the award (within the EU) and should not, in and of
itself, prevent the Tribunal from awarding damages to the Claimant in the first place.’”°
This holds true even more because the Tribunal is in no position to find whether the EC
would grant its authorization, i.e. whether any such obstacle to enforcement would be
permanent.

Accordingly, the only issue for the Tribunal to decide is whether the Respondent’s failure
to notify RFI to the EC as State aid renders any expectations of investors with respect to
RF1 illegitimate.

In the Tribunal’s view, there is force to the argument that RF1 constitutes State aid.’”’ This
holds true in particular if one deems binding, or at least affords deference to, the EC’s
assessment in this respect, given that the EC qualified RF1 as State aid in its submissions
in this arbitration and, arguably, also in an obiter dictum in the EC State Aid Decision.’8
Also, the Tribunal finds that if RF1 was in fact State aid, it seems difficult to avoid the
conclusion that RF1 was unlawful under EU law for not having been notified to the EC, in
violation of Article 108(3) TFEU. However, the Tribunal considers that it does not need to
take a position on either of these questions because even if RF1 was unlawful under Article
108(3) TFEU, the Tribunal finds that this would not preclude investors from having had
legitimate expectations with respect to RF1, for the reasons set out in the following.

This finding of the Tribunal, together the underlying reasons set out in the remainder of
this section (2), reflect the view of the majority, with Arbitrator Sands dissenting.

First, the Tribunal does not agree with the argument that the Tribunal is bound to a ruling
in the EC State Aid Decision whereby no legitimate expectations protected by Article 10(1)

6 Same view BayWa v. Spain, {568; Eurus v. Spain, ]422; see also Vattenfall v. Germany, {230 (in the context of

78 EC State Aid Decision, 4158, which states that “In the vei

specific situation of the present case, [...] a Member

 

State grants State aid to investors, without respecting the notification and stand-still obligation of Article 108(3) TFEU,
legitimate expectations with regard to those State aid payments are excluded”. Even though the Respondent failed to
(timely) notify not only RF1 but also RF3, meaning that the quoted text could also refer to RF3, the context suggests
that the EC alluded to RFI, and implied its nature as State aid.

145

649

650

ECT could have existed in relation to RF1. To begin with, the Tribunal is not convinced
that the EC State Aid Decision did in fact make a ruling on this issue. The subject-matter
of the EC State Aid Decision was whether RF3 should receive the EC’s authorization under
the EU State Aid Rules.’ Therefore, even though the relevant paragraphs of the EC State
Aid Decision indeed seem to refer to RF1 rather than RF3,”*° this can only be an obiter
dictum rather than a ruling — even more so as the EC State Aid Decision primarily took the
position that the ECT is not even applicable in an intra-EU context.’*! Even if the EC’s
remarks on RFI were not just an obiter dictum, the Tribunal is unable to accept the
proposition that any such ruling made by the EC on the interpretation and application of
Article 10(1) ECT would be binding on the Tribunal.”? The Tribunal must decide this case
based on the applicable law as determined by Articles 26(6) and 16(2) ECT. The applicable
law, however, does not contain any rule that would bind the Tribunal to any finding of the
EC as to whether investors under RFI could have held legitimate expectations for the
purpose of Article 10(1) ECT. In particular, no such binding effect can be derived from EU
law. Even assuming arguendo that, in principle, EU law forms part of the applicable law,
Article 16(2) ECT would preclude the application of any rule of EU law pursuant to which
the Tribunal is bound to the EC’s alleged ruling. After all, binding the Tribunal to such
alleged ruling would be more unfavourable to investors than Part III of the ECT itself,
pursuant to which legitimate expectations did in fact exist in relation to RFI (see section
(4) infra). The Tribunal also notes that while the arbitral awards invoked by the EC did
take into account findings made in EC decisions, those awards did not concern, much less
make any ruling on, the issue at stake here, namely whether the EC can bind a tribunal
constituted under the ECT when it comes to matters of interpretation and application of the
ECT itself.”

Secondly, it is a general principle of public international law, to which the Tribunal fully
subscribes, that a host State may not rely on its internal law as a ground for non-fulfilment
of its international obligations.’** As both the Respondent and the EC acknowledge, EU
law forms part of the Respondent’s legal system. Hence, from the perspective of the ECT,
the EU State Aid Rules must be considered (at least: also) as internal law of the
Respondent.”?°

Thirdly, the Tribunal is unconvinced by the EC’s proposition”* that there is longstanding
arbitral jurisprudence to the effect that an investor cannot have any legitimate expectation
of treatment that is unlawful under the laws of the host State, or based on assurances that
were made contra legem. In the Tribunal’s view, all of the decisions invoked for this
proposition actually say something else, namely that an investor cannot expect protection
of an investment that is itself illegal, or that was made through illegal means (in particular

involving corruption). The Respondent does not assert, and the Tribunal is not aware of
any indication whatsoever, that the Claimant’s investment was itself illegal or involved
illegal practices. Instead, the question before this Tribunal is quite different, namely
whether an investor can legitimately expect to continue receiving subsidies if these
subsidies are unlawful under the laws of the host State.

Fourthly, irrespective of the fact that neither the Respondent nor the EC submitted any
pertinent jurisprudence on this point, the Tribunal does find it reasonable to assume that,
in principle, an investor cannot legitimately expect to receive subsidies that are illegal
under the laws of the host State, at least if a diligent investor would have been aware of
such illegality. However, the Tribunal also finds that investors should not be held to a
higher standard than the host State itself.’*” In this respect, the Tribunal notes the following
facts, which the Tribunal deems highly relevant:

(i) At the time the Claimant invested, the Respondent itself apparently considered
that RF1 did not constitute State aid, and that it was therefore not illegal to
implement RF1 without seeking the EC’s authorization. In fact, the Respondent
submits that only through a CJEU decision in 2014 did it become aware that it
needed to notify RF3 as State aid.”*

(ii) The EC, being the guardian of the TFEU and being obliged to “keep under
constant review all systems of aid existing in [EU Member States]” (Article 108(1)
TFEU), was fully aware of RF1 and never took any steps despite the Respondent’s
failure to notify it.”?

(iii) There is no showing that RF1 did not comply with the substantive requirements
of Article 107 TFEU. Indeed, it actually appears quite likely that those
requirements are met, i.e. that RF1 would have been authorized by the EC had the
Respondent notified it.”°

(iv) The EC authorized RF3 in spite of its “/amenting” that it was notified too late, and
without even requiring that beneficiaries pay interest for the time between the
granting and the authorization of the State aid, as it could have.”*!

(v) The two foregoing points suggest that had the Respondent complied with its duty
to notify RF1, even after the Claimant had invested, it could reasonably be
expected that the Claimant could have kept any subsidies granted under RF1. In
other words, even if one considered that the Claimant could not legitimately
expect RFI to be legal under EU law pending authorization by the EC, it is

9 Cf. BayWa v. Spain, 1569(d) and (h).

740 Cf. BayWa v. Spain, 19563f. The Tribunal also notes that according to EC Communication, The support of
electricity from renewable energy sources (COM(2005)) 627, 3.5, approximately 60 support schemes for renewable
energy were approved by the EC from 2001 to 2004, see CC on BayWa, 29.

741 CF. BayWa v. Spain, 1558.

147

reasonable to say that the Claimant could have legitimately expected that (i) the
Respondent would meet its EU law obligation to notify RF1, (ii) the EC would
authorize RFI and (iii) the Claimant would subsequently be entitled to keep all
benefits under RF1.

(vi) While in hindsight it may seem “surprising” that the Claimant was not concerned
about the fact that RF1 had not been notified to the EC as State aid,” it appears
that at the time the Claimant invested, no one in Spain (including the Respondent
itself and the EC) held any such concerns.

652 Lastly, it is striking that while the Respondent has now taken the stance, albeit very late in
this arbitration, that RF1 was in fact State aid that needed to be notified to the EC, the
Respondent appears not to have made such notification until this very day. The Tribunal
has great difficulty with the Respondent’s argument that its own continued failure to notify
RF1, which the Respondent itself acknowledges is illegal, should go to the detriment of the
Claimant.

653 For the above reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent’s failure to notify RF1 to the
EC does not automatically precludes the Claimant from holding legitimate expectations
with respect to RF1.™ At most, one might say, in the words of the tribunal in BayWa v.
Spain, that

“[bly about 2010, if not earlier, the Special Regime subsidies were at least arguably state aid
and notifiable as such to the EC: the subsidies were not notified, and were unenforceable as such
pending EC approval following notification, which never happened. This gave them added
vulnerability.” (emphasis added)

 

(3) The SOMW Argument

654 As a matter of principle, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent’s view that if the CSP
Plants did not meet the legal requirements for entering the Special Regime created by RF1,
the Claimant could not legitimately expect to receive any feed-in remuneration that is
limited to Special Regime facilities.

655 The Tribunal notes that the Parties disagree on whether the CSP Plants met the applicable
legal requirement of an “installed capacity” not exceeding 50 MW. There seems to be no
dispute on the technical facts: the CSP Plants’ nominal capacity of the generator (gross
production) exceeds 50 MW, while the power that the CSP Plants are designed and
operated to deliver to the grid (net production) does not. Accordingly, the Parties’ dispute
is confined to the question of which of the two numbers matters. In other words, the Parties
disagree on the interpretation of the relevant Spanish legislation, namely how to interpret
the notion of “installed capacity” mentioned therein.

The Tribunal’s findings on the Respondent’s 50 MW argument reflect the view of the
majority, with Arbitrator Sands dissenting.

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant’s view that this investment arbitration is not the
proper forum for deciding this question of domestic law. This holds true in particular as
the Respondent has not disputed that the commissioning certificates and admittance of the
CSP Plants to RAIPRE are valid administrative acts under Spanish law unless and until
they are annulled by the competent Spanish authorities, which has not happened. Therefore,
in the eyes of the Tribunal, the CSP Plants qualify for the Special Regime and the
corresponding feed-in remuneration simply because valid administrative decisions issued
by the Respondent itself say so.

The Tribunal wishes to add that if those administrative decisions are voidable under
Spanish law, the Respondent would have had ample time to initiate the necessary steps.
The fact that, based on the record, it has not done so, sheds further doubt on the
Respondent’s interpretation of the term “installed capacity”,’ without the Tribunal

needing to take any definitive position in this regard.

Consequently, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant could
not have held any legitimate expectations in respect of its investment in the CSP Plants,
due to their installed capacity.”°

(4) Nature of Legitimate Expectations Created

As mentioned above, legitimate expectations must be assessed as at the point(s) in time
when the investment is made. The Parties’ positions on the relevant point(s) in time have
changed over the course of the arbitration.”*’ Given that the investment consists of indirect
shareholding by the Claimant in the SPVs, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant’s
investment occurred when that shareholding was acquired, including as part of subsequent
capital increases.”“8 Therefore, with respect to the Wind Farms, the Tribunal finds that the
relevant points in time are 6 November 2007 (acquisition of shares in Condeu),
19 September 2009 (acquisition of shares in Dagosa) and 20 December 2011 (capital
increase in Dagosa). As regards the CSP Plants, the relevant points in time are
21 November 2007 (acquisition of shares in Iberedlica Solar), 17 September 2008 (capital

As does the fact, acknowledged by both Parties’ technical experts, that the vast majority of CSP plants accepted to

the Special Regime as at the time the ATA CSP Capacity Report was prepared (namely at least 40 out of 44 CSP
plants) had a generator with a nominal power of 55 MW, i.e. the same as the CSP Plants, see HT, Day 3, 134:1-135:21.

increase in Iberedlica Solar) and 26 May 2011 (acquisition of additional shares in
Tberedlica Solar).

661 Contrary to the argument advanced by the Claimant,” the Tribunal finds that no further
investments were made when the CSP SPVs entered into EPC, O&M and financing
agreements. The Claimant was not a party to any of those agreements.’*° They may or may
not have represented investments by the CSP SPVs, but those are legal entities that are
separate from the Claimant and the Tribunal finds no basis for piercing the corporate veil.
For the same reason, capital increases in which Dagosa participated”! cannot be qualified
as investments of the Claimant, irrespective of the fact that it is a fully-owned subsidiary
of the Claimant.

662 The Tribunal will now examine, in turn, the “commitments, promises and assurances”
invoked by the Claimant, to determine whether any of them gave rise to a legitimate
expectation of Absolute Stability and, if not, what other expectation could have been
legitimately held by the Claimant.

 

(a) RD 661/2007 and the Press Release Accompanying It

663 Insofar as the Claimant refers generally to the economic rights granted to investors under
RD 661/2007, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant confuses the promise of a certain
remuneration with the promise that this remuneration will remain unchanged. The fact that
a piece of legislation grants certain rights to investors does not in and of itself constitute a
commitment, much less a specific one, that this legislation will not be changed in the future.
If a piece of legislation is at all capable of engendering the legitimate expectation that it
will not itself be changed by subsequent legislation of the same or higher level of hierarchy
(which is doubtful, see [641 supra), such piece of legislation would at least need to contain
a provision specifically stating so. However, no such provision exists in RD 661/2007.

664 — In particular, Article 44(3) RD 661/2007 merely provides that facilities that commenced
operations before or shortly after a quadrennial revision are exempted from such
revision.” By contrast, Article 44(3) RD 661/2007 does not purport to protect investors
against a revision of RD 661/2007 itself, and neither does Law 54/1997 contain any
provision to this effect. Moreover, Article 44(3) RD 661/2007 does not even cover

9 C_PHB, [§91f., 96, 101-110.

750 The Tribunal notes that, initially, the Claimant may have acted as a guarantor with respect to some of the financing
agreements (see C-PHB, 156; also, elswhere the Claimant labels the financing agreements as “non-recourse”, see C-
PHB, 417), even though it is unclear from the Claimant’s submissions if the Claimant itself or one of its subsidiaries
was the guarantor. However, in any case, the Claimant acknowledges that once the registration in RAIPRE had taken
place, no recourse was possible anymore (C-PHB, 156). Hence, even if the Claimant initially acted as guarantor and
even if this qualified as an investment, such investment ceased to exist at the latest on 19 December 2012, when
stake in this arbitration (see MoM, §{[253, 278; RoM,
fn. 261). This was before RF3 was adopted. In addition, the Claimant has not claimed that it incurred any damage in
relation to this alleged investment.

revisions of the premiums’? — which is highly relevant because the Wind Farms always
operated under the Pool Price Plus Premium option and the Claimant asserts that the CSP
Plants would have chosen to do so had RF1 not been abrogated before they got to choose
between its two remuneration options.”*+

665 In addition to the plain wording of Article 44(3) RD 661/2007, it is important to note that
at the time the Claimant invested, the Spanish legislator had already introduced multiple
amendments to RD 436/2004. The Spanish Supreme Court had repeatedly dismissed
challenges against those amendments despite the existence of Article 40(3) RD 436/2004,
which is largely’ identical to Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007. Diligent investors must be
taken to be aware of important judgments of the host State’s highest courts.”*° This holds
true in particular in the present case where the relevant judgments were expressly referred
to in reports by the CNE and the Respondent’s Chief State Attorney on a draft of
RD 661/2007,’*” i.e. precisely the piece of legislation that the Claimant argues could not
be changed. Therefore, also in view of the Spanish Supreme Court’s jurisprudence, it was
not legitimate for the Claimant to expect on any of the investment dates that pursuant to
Article 44(3) RD 661/2007, the remuneration values set by RD 661/2007 could not be
changed to the detriment of existing facilities.”>*

666 This analysis is not changed by the press release accompanying RD 661/2007. While
emphasizing that by virtue of RD 661/2007, “stability in time is sought allowing business
owners to plan in the medium and long term’, this is a fairly general statement that does
not come close to a specific commitment that the remuneration values would never change.
Also, while stating that any revisions of the tariffs would not affect facilities in operation,
this is clearly a reference to Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 and does not purport to go
beyond the commitment that this provision itself makes. In particular, the press release
likewise distinguishes between tariffs and premiums, and does not state that revisions of
premiums would not apply to existing facilities.”*°

667 In summary, therefore, neither RD 661/2007 nor the press release accompanying it were
specific commitments that the remunerative regime of RD 661/2007 would remain
unchanged.

754 MoM, 190, 278; CWS-IMR, 47.

755 The main difference being that due to the different components of the remunerative regime, RD 661/2007 is
different in relation to the remuneration values covered by the protection that is offered by this provision. In view of
this, the Tribunal is not convinced by the Claimant’s argument that the Spanish Supreme Court’s jurisprudence was
irrelevant simply because, at the time, it only concerned Article 40(3) RD 436/2004 rather than Article 44(3) RD
661/2007 (or because the cases decided concerned other renewable energy technologies than wind or CSP).

(b) The Respondent’s Advertising of Its Regulatory Framework to Foreign Investors

668 The Claimant refers to multiple presentations that Spain made on the attractiveness of its
remuneration regime. In particular, the Claimant invokes a presentation on photovoltaic
investments labelled “The Sun can be yours” dated 24 May 2005,” a presentation named
“Opportunities in Renewable Energy in Spain” dated 15 November 20077! and a
presentation titled “Business Opportunities in Spain” dated 27 April 2009” (the latter two
of which also dealt with CSP).

669 However, the Claimant explicitly stated that it did not invoke those presentations in the
context of the alleged violation of legitimate expectations, but rather as unilateral
undertakings under the umbrella clause.’* Moreover, as pointed out by the Respondent,
the Claimant neither specifically asserted nor provided any evidence that it was aware of
and relied on any statements contained in those presentations when it made its
investments.” In addition, the presentation of 15 May 2005 pre-dated RD 661/2007, while
the other two above-mentioned presentations post-dated some of the Claimant’s
investments. Finally, those marketing documents are fairly vague as to what precisely is
meant with the stability advertised therein, which in any case excludes qualifying them as
specific commitments.”

670 In summary, Spain’s efforts in marketing RF1 were neither claimed by the Claimant nor
did they in fact engender a legitimate expectation of Absolute Stability.

(c) Registration in RAIPRE and the Remuneration Pre-Allocation Registry

671 RD 661/2007 merely provides that registration in RAIPRE is a requirement for being
subject to the regulatory regime in place at the time.’ As the Tribunal has already found
that RD 661/2007 itself did not engender the legitimate expectation that it would not be
changed, fulfilling a requirement to become subject to RD 661/2007 cannot have generated
such expectation either.” In addition, the CSP Plants obtained final registration in
RAIPRE only on 31 May and 19 December 2012, respectively, i.e. after the Claimant’s
last CSP-related investment on 26 May 2011. Therefore, such registration cannot possibly

have created any legitimate expectations on the part of the Claimant at the time of its
investment.

With respect to the CSP Plants’ registration in the Remuneration Pre-Allocation Registry,
the situation is essentially the same. RDL 6/2009 made the registration in that registry a
requirement for new facilities coming under the scope of RD 661/2007. It did not, however,
say anything about whether RD 661/2007 could be changed to the detriment of plants
admitted to that registry.” Indeed, it would be quite peculiar if the remuneration offered
by RD 661/2007 could be changed to the detriment of facilities registered in RAIPRE and
already in operation, but not for facilities that are merely pre-registered.

(d) Resolution of the Council of Ministers of 13 November 2009

With the Resolution of its Council of Ministers of 13 November 2009, the Respondent
accepted new CSP and wind capacity to the Special Regime, but staggered the entry into
operation in order to safeguard the technical and economic sustainability of the electricity
system. While the Claimant argues this amounted to “a further guarantee [...] regarding
the future stability of the regulatory framework” because it declared that the CSP Plants’
production was acceptable for the power management system, there can be no doubt that
admitting new facilities into the Special Regime does not by itself constitute any specific
commitment of Absolute Stability of the remunerative regime in force at the time.

(e) RD 1614/2010, the 2010 Wind/CSP Agreements and Accompanying Press Releases

Based on the record, the Tribunal is of the impression that the communications between
Protermosolar and AEE on the one side and the Respondent on the other side did in fact go
beyond the type of consultation process that would normally form part of the Spanish
legislation process. However, this intensified exchange does not necessarily render the
results of these communications specific commitments by the Respondent vis-a-vis the
Claimant.”

In any case, neither the 2010 Agreements nor RD 1614/2010 contained any language
through which Spain specifically committed not to implement any further changes to the
remunerative regime, even for existing facilities. In particular, while those documents
provided for an expansion of the scope of Article 44(3) RD 66 1/2007 (notably by including
premiums), this protection remained limited to the quadrennial revisions provided for in
that same Article.’”” Moreover, analogous to the above findings on RD 661/2007 (see 1665
supra), the constant jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court left no room for investors
to legitimately expect that the remuneration provided for by RD 1614/2010 could not be
changed at all. Indeed, the observations filed by AEE on the draft of RD 1614/2010 (see

ame view Stadtwerke Miinchen v. Spain, 300.

194 supra) show that this concept was well-understood by the renewable energy sector at
the time.

(f) | The Waiver Letters and Waiver Acceptance Resolutions

Even though the exchange of Waiver Letters and Waiver Acceptance Resolutions was part
of the course of action agreed between Protermosolar and the Respondent in the lead-up to
RD 1614/2010, the Tribunal does not find that this gave rise to a contract, as argued by the
Claimant.””!

Irrespective of their legal nature, the Waiver Acceptance Resolutions do not contain any
language that could be understood as a specific commitment of Absolute Stability. Instead,
the Waiver Acceptance Resolutions merely state that

at present [...] the remuneration applicable to the facility is made up of the tariffs, premiums,
upper and lower limits and supplements established by RD 661/2007 [...] and updated annually
[...], with the current values from January 1, 2011 being as follows: [...]’” (emphasis added).

   

This is not a specific commitment of Absolute Stability.’ In fact, given the express
qualification “at present” and “current”, the Tribunal finds it difficult to discern any
commitment of any sort in this statement.

(g) Conclusion on Legitimate Expectations Created

It follows from the above that the Claimant has failed to prove any specific commitment of
Absolute Stability. In other words, the Claimant could not legitimately expect that the
Respondent would not make any changes at all to RF1.

However, even in the absence of such a specific commitment, the Tribunal finds that it was
still legitimate to expect Relative Stability of RFI, i.e. that any changes to RF1 would not
exceed an acceptable margin (see 642 supra). This finding of the Tribunal and the
remainder of this section (g) reflect the view of the majority, with Arbitrator Sands
dissenting.

In order to make the acceptable margin and thus the content of the legitimate expectation
of Relative Stability more intelligible, the Tribunal finds it useful to resort to the following
criteria, all of which find some support, albeit to different degree, in arbitral jurisprudence
referenced by the Parties, and on all of which the Parties have made submissions:

(i) Magnitude of the change: The more fundamental the changes to the legislation
are, i.e. the more the essential the elements of the previous regime are that are

being removed, the more likely such changes are to exceed the acceptable
margin.’

Economic impact: The more damaging the legislative changes are to the investor,
the more likely they are to exceed the acceptable margin.”

Abruptness of the change: The more time a host State gives to the investor to
adjust to the new regulatory regime, i.e. through timely announcing the change
and/or implementing a transitional period during which the new regime does not
yet (fully) apply, the more likely it is that Relative Stability is respected;
contrariwise, if the regime change even features elements of retroactivity, or at
least retrospectivity, this makes the legislative changes more likely to violate
legitimate expectations.””°

Change of external circumstances: The more the legislative changes were
triggered by a change of external circumstances, i.e. circumstances largely beyond
the control of the host State, as opposed to a mere change of internal policy, the
more likely such legislative changes are to remain within the acceptable margin
of change.’”

Public interests involved: The more important the public interests involved are,
which often coincides with a high level of regulation, the more a diligent investor
could have expected change. This is because, as rightly noted by the Respondent:

[t]he host State is not required to elevate the interests of the investor above all other

ions, and the application of the FET standard allows for a balancing or
weighing exercise by the State and the determination of a breach of the FET standard
must be made in the light of the high measure of deference which international law
generally extends to the right of national authorities to regulate matters within their
own borders.7”°

 

 

  

Prior legislative practice: The more the measures in dispute depart from the host
State’s previously established practice in respect of legislative changes, in
particular in the same field, the less could a diligent investor have expected those
measures and the more likely they are to violate Relative Stability. Of course, this
cannot mean that a host State can escape responsibility under the FET standard
altogether if only its past behaviour was sufficiently reckless; however, if diligent
investors are aware of a history of legislative changes in the relevant field,
investment therein involves a certain assumption of risk by the investor, which is

relevant to the determination of whether legislative changes introduced after the
investment exceed the acceptable margin.’””

(vii) Stability assurances: Even if a host State’s assurances as to the stability of the
regulatory framework do not qualify as specific commitments giving rise to a
legitimate expectation of Absolute Stability, the degree to which such assurances
were made is still relevant for the question of whether subsequent changes to the
regulatory framework exceeded the acceptable margin.’*°

682 = The Tribunal will henceforth use the term “radical” to denote changes that exceed the
acceptable margin of change, as outlined above, and thus violate the notion of Relative
Stability.”*!

683 = The Tribunal will return to the above criteria when assessing whether the Claimant’s
legitimate expectation of Relative Stability was frustrated, i.e. whether the Disputed
Measures exceeded the acceptable margin (see section d. infra). Already at this point,
however, the Tribunal is in a position to find that for the legitimate expectations held by
the Claimant, it does not make any material difference which of the six investment dates
one looks at.

684 In particular, no relevant changes occurred between the first three investment dates
(6 November 2007, 21 November 2007 and 17 September 2008) that could have changed
the Claimant’s legitimate expectations.”

685 Before the next investment, which was made on 19 September 2009, the main relevant
changes were the growth of the Tariff Deficit coupled with the enactment of RDL 6/2009,
which prepared the ground for staggering additional renewables capacity coming into
operation so as to limit further costs to the electricity system. The Tribunal finds that, on
the one hand, the growing Tariff Deficit, being significantly influenced by the global
financial and economic crisis,’”*> was an external change of circumstance that made
legislative change more likely. Similarly, the adoption of RDL 6/2009 provided another

  

79 Cf. RWE Innogy v. Spain, 1539.

780 Treated as a matter of degree also in Operafund v. Spain, 4481; arguably to the same effect Electrabel v. Hungary
1, 7.78; NextEra v. Spain, 4591.

78! To the Tribunal, this terminology has the benefit of not being limited to the magnitude of the change (as opposed
to “fundamental”; “removal of essential elements”), the time element (as opposed to “sudden”), the State’s prior or
other behaviour (as opposed to “inconsistent”) or the public interests involved (as opposed to “contrary to the public
interest”). Also, compared to the terms “unfair”, “unjust”, “disproportionate”, the term “radical” makes even clearer
that the changes must be of a very significant magnitude, about which there seems no disagreement in arbitral
jurisprudence on Relative Stability.

782 While IDAE, Opportunities in Renewable Energy in Spain, 15 November 2007 (C-0678), which claims on slide 4
that the premium system of RD 661/2007 was “guaranteed”, post-dates only the first investment date, this a fairly
general marketing document that does not specify the scope of the “guarantee” (which could, e.g., refer to the
protection from revisions as per Art. 44(3)). In addition, it is unclear to whom the presentation was held and, thus,
whether the Claimant or a diligent investor would even have been aware of it. In any case, the Claimant did not
specifically rely on it with respect to -gitimate expectations.

783 See on this assessment [895-897 infra.

example of Spain amending the regulatory framework to the detriment of investors,’
going to the criterion of the host State’s previous legal practice. On the other hand,
however, by introducing the Remuneration Pre-Allocation Registry through RDL 6/2009,
the Respondent did imply a certain assurance that those facilities that did manage to get
registered in time (and get registered in RAIPRE within the applicable deadline) would
gain some additional protection, as opposed to non-registered facilities. Balancing these
factors, the Tribunal finds that on 19 September 2009, the margin of acceptable change
was not significantly different than on the previous investment dates.

Before the next (and last) investment dates, i.e. 26 May 2011 and 20 December 2011, the
main relevant changes were the continued growth of the Tariff Deficit, the December 2009
judgments of the Spanish Supreme Court as well as the 2010 Agreements and the
enactment of RD 1614/2010. On the one hand, both the Supreme Court judgments’** and
RD 1614/2010 showed to investors that the Respondent could (under Spanish law) and
would in fact enact amendments to RD 661/2007 that were detrimental to investors,’®*° even
in relation to facilities that were already in operation or at least pre-registered. Also,
RD 1614/2010 was additional proof of the Respondent’s determination to gain control over
the tariff deficit, as was clear at the time from its preamble, the related press release and
the underlying explanatory report.’8’ On the other hand, the 2010 Agreements could be
seen to mark the beginning of a legislative practice that Spain would not introduce such
cuts for existing facilities without first seeking an understanding with the affected sectors,
a practice which Spain did not follow in relation to the Disputed Measures (it being noted,
however, that RD 1565/2010 had evidenced shortly before the 2010 Agreements that in
case no such understanding was reached, the Respondent was willing to enact detrimental
changes anyway). Also, by RD 1614/2010 shielding existing facilities against certain
revisions of the economic regime in a stronger fashion than RD 661/2007 (mainly by
including premiums into the protective provision), the Respondent can be seen to have
somewhat reinforced its assurances of stability. Balancing the foregoing observations, it
does not seem to the Tribunal that from the perspective of 26 May and 20 December 2011,
the assessment of whether the Disputed Measures brought about a radical change should
be materially different from the assessment made with respect to the earlier investments.

Accordingly, in its further analysis, the Tribunal will focus on the investments made on
6 November 2007, 21 November 2007 and 17 September 2008, which in the Tribunal’s
assessment marked the Claimant’s main investments decisions anyway.

 

ain, 4§407f. Even though the Council of Ministers’ Resolution of 13 November 2009 (C-

 

0113) concluded that additional renewable energy production capacity could be admitted to the system without
compromising its economic sustainability, the Claimant itself acknowledged that this Resolution only allowed a
reduced number of CSP plants to operate (RoM, {{1430). Also, RD 6/2009 showed to investors that Spain was
increasingly concerned by the growth of the tariff deficit and was willing to take measures it considered necessary to
reduce it.

Reliance by the Claimant
The Claimant’s Principal Arguments

The Claimant acknowledges that the investor in question needs to have relied on the
expectation created by the host State. However, the Claimant points out that it is not
necessary for the entire investment to have been based solely on such expectation. Instead,
it is sufficient that the expectation was a determining factor in the decision to invest, or in
the manner or magnitude of the investment.’8§ Moreover, the Claimant submits that in
accordance with case-law and doctrine, the standard is an objective one, whereas an
investor’s subjective beliefs are not decisive.’*° Therefore, in order to prove reliance, the
Claimant submits that it does not have to prove its own subjective perceptions, but only the
contents of the regulatory framework and the other representations made by the host State
that were calculated to induce the investment. If the investor then actually invests, there is
a fair inference that the investor was induced to invest by the State’s conduct.’”°

With respect to due diligence, the Claimant argues that when the regulations are perfectly
clear in offering certain protections to investors, the investors can legitimately expect such
protections without the issue of diligence being relevant.”'! In the Claimant’s view,
diligence of the investor might be relevant only if the regulatory framework offered no
guarantees to induce investment, was unstable or unclear, or the investment climate was
risky — none of which was the case when the Claimant invested. In addition, even in such
case, Article 10(1) ECT does not require, nor define, any specific standard of diligence,
which depend on the facts of the case.””? In particular, according to the Claimant,
commissioning a legal opinion is not a precondition to establishing legitimate
expectations.”

In support of its assertion that when making its investment, it relied on this legitimate
expectation created by Spain, the Claimant submits that the Special Regime was adopted
with the specific intention to attract investment and that the Claimant invested with the
specific purpose of benefitting from this regime. In the Claimant’s view, the Respondent’s
regulations and representations, followed by the Claimant’s investment, are evidence of
the Claimant’s reliance.” In addition, the Claimant refers to the witness statement of
Mr. Gomez, according to whom the Claimant would not have invested were it not for its
reliance on a stable feed-in remuneration for the entire lifetime of the plants.’”°

The Claimant alleges that its conclusion at the time as to the stability of the regulatory
framework was supported by the legal services of Iberedlica and Iberedlica Solar as well
as by their auditors.’°° In addition, the Claimant contends that all Wind Farms and CSP
Plants were supported by technical and legal due diligence reports.””’ Moreover,
Mr. Gémez testified at the hearing that he received verbal advice on many occasions, inter
alia by the law firm representing the Claimant in this arbitration, about the legal framework
for renewable energy projects in Spain, and that none of the lawyers he spoke to ever raised
any concerns as to the stability of the remuneration regime.’** The Claimant adds that, in
any case, as per Novenergia v. Spain, RF1 “was so adamantly clear that its understanding
by common readers did not require a particularly sophisticated analysis”, and no due
diligence carried out between 2007 and 2011 would have ever forecasted a full replacement
of a remuneration model with a new and unprecedented one.”

  

The Claimant submits that in addition to itself and any other reasonable investor, reliance
was placed on the stability of RF1 also by many sophisticated banks, financial entities and
their legal advisers. According to the Claimant, this reliance is evidenced by the fact that
investors entered into major long-term project finance schemes for financing the
construction and commissioning of almost all renewable energy projects that were
developed in Spain, including the CSP Plants and Wind Farms. Similarly, banks and
financial institutions were willing to enter into interest rate swaps with the Claimant (and
many other investors), which they would not have done had the feed-in remuneration not
been guaranteed to pertain in time.*°° Relying on Masdar v. Spain and Antin v. Spain, the
Claimant argues that this reliance by banks on stable revenue streams, in turn, is further
proof for the legitimacy of the Claimant’s expectation, even if the bank’s underlying due
diligence was not made available to the Claimant.”

The Respondent’s Principal Arguments

According to the Respondent, the guiding thread of all legislative changes before and after
the Claimant’s investment was to guarantee the sustainability of the SES and to avoid
situations of over-remuneration, always maintaining the principle of reasonable return. As
Mr. Gémez had witnessed all those regulatory changes since 2000, the Respondent claims
he could not have been ignorant of the fact that there was no guarantee that any specific
remuneration regime would remain unchanged. In particular, the Respondent claims that
RD 661/2007 itself, on which the Claimant seeks to base its expectation of petrification,
effected a change in the previous remuneration regime, despite the fact that RD 436/2004
had contained an article that was very similar to Article 44(3) RD 661/2007.°°

The Respondent asserts that neither Mr. Gémez nor the Claimant nor the SPVs did in fact
have the expectation that the remunerative regime of RD 661/2007 could not be altered. In
the Respondent’s view, this is confirmed inter alia by the financing agreements for the CSP
Plants, which make express reference to a “recalculation of the base case in the event of
unfavourable regime change”,®* as well as by the annual accounts of the CSP Plants,
which acknowledged a regulatory risk, in particular in the form of variations in the
premiums paid.**

In addition, the Respondent points out that there is no documentary evidence suggesting
that, at the time of the investment, the Claimant was aware of any of the press releases,
public statements, presentations or roadshows invoked by it. In fact, most of them had been
produced by the Respondent in the document production phase of this arbitration.
Similarly, the Respondent notes that there is not a single contemporaneous document
showing that the Claimant relied on the foregoing statements, the 2010 Agreements or the
Waiver Acceptance Resolutions.*°

Furthermore, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s alleged expectations are not
supported by any legal due diligence undertaken before the investment was made. To the
contrary, during the document production phase, the Claimant either submitted that the due
diligence reports requested by the Respondent did not exist, or failed to produce them. In
the Respondent’s view, the Claimant cannot rely on any due diligence performed not by
itself, but by the banks, especially when the relevant due diligence reports were not made
available to the Claimant. Moreover, the Respondent submits that while the due diligence
supposedly conducted by the law firm representing the Claimant in this arbitration was not
provided in this arbitration, an interview of December 2010 with a partner from the same
firm, which was published by a photovoltaic association, included the statement that “No
Royal decree is free from being amended according to the regulatory risk theory, even

retroactively” 8°

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal’s findings on the issue of reliance reflect the view of the majority, with
Arbitrator Sands dissenting.

In principle, as acknowledged by both Parties, it is well-established in arbitral
jurisprudence that an investor can only base its claim on those representations of the host
State upon which the investor relied when making its investment (which needs to be

83 CMoM, 809, referring to BQR 72, BQR 73 and C-0492 to C-0497. In addition, RjoM, {11231-1235 refers to the

established by the investor).8” However, the Tribunal finds that this element of reliance is
less relevant when the only legitimate expectation in question is Relative Stability, as is
the case here. First, as discussed above,*°* the expectation of Relative Stability is legitimate
even in the absence of any specific representations made by the State. In the absence of
such representations, there is no action of the host State, except for the adoption of the
regulatory framework in question, that could serve as point of reference, or object, of the
investor’s reliance. Secondly, if the viability of an investment depends on a certain
regulatory framework, it stands to reason that in normal circumstances, the investment will
not be made in the first place unless the investor relies on the absence of any radical
changes to that regulatory framework to the investor’s detriment. In other words, the
Tribunal finds that the making of the investment itself usually implies reliance on the
Relative Stability of the regulatory framework upon which the investment depends.

699 It appears that the tribunal in Charanne v. Spain came to the same conclusion, given its
general finding — not based on any specific showing of actual reliance by the investor
before it — that

an investor has a legitimate expectation that, when modifying the regulation under which it made
the investment, the State will not act unreasonably, contrary to the public interest or in a
disproportionate manner*"° (emphasis added)

 

 

700 +The Tribunal finds additional, albeit implicit support for this approach in many other
arbitral awards. Indeed, in almost all awards on record related to the Relative Stability of a
host State’s regulatory framework,*"! reliance by the investor was either not addressed at
all®!? or only in the abstract, ie. without assessing whether the individual investor did in
fact rely on Relative Stability (as opposed to the question as to whether a reasonable

Mexico, 98; CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 13 September 2001 (CL-

and Equitable Treatment, 2012 (CL-0123), p. 70.

808 See 642 supra.

8 The Tribunal notes that this essentially resembles the Claimant’s argument that there is a fair inference that the
legal framework induced the investor to invest, even though that argument seemed to have been more far-reaching as
it was not clearly limited to the narrower notion of Relative Stability.

810 Charanne y. Spain, 1514; similarly general statements can be found in Novenergia v. Spain, 1654;
Foresight/Greentech v. Spain, 1359.

811 This excludes Operafund v. Spain and 9REN vy. Spain, as both of them found a specific commitment of Absolute
Stability in Article 44(3) RD 661/2007, see 640 supra. While Masdar v. Spain and InfraRed v. Spain (albeit limited
to some elements of the legislation, {[{[406, 449) likewise eventually found a specific commitment, they did first discuss
Relative Stability.

812 See in particular Charanne v. Spain, Isolux v. Spain, Eiser v. Spain (even though mentioning in {119 as part of the
factual background certain facts that could be seen to establish reliance), Antin v. Spain, Foresight/Greentech v. Spain;
the requirement of reliance was neither clearly stated nor applied also in Novenergia v. Spain, Masdar v. Spain,
NextEra v. Spain and BayWa v. Spain (which only refers multiple times generally to “reliance interests of participants”,
e.g. in {463, but not to a requirement for the individual investor to show reliance). InfraRed v. Spain is particularly
noteworthy because in the context of Relative Stability, the tribunal requires reliance only on the regulatory framework
under which the investment is made, rather than on its stability (1368), while in the context of a specific commitment
of Absolute Stability, the tribunal seems to require the investor to establish reliance on this Absolute Stability (]453).

investor was entitled to rely thereon).*!? Were it not for an underlying assumption that the
Relative Stability of the host State’s legal framework is generally relied on by investors, it
would be difficult to explain why reliance did not play any role in all those awards
revolving around Relative Stability, despite reliance being generally accepted as a
prerequisite for a legitimate expectations claim.

In line with the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that the burden for establishing reliance on
Relative Stability is a low one. In essence, the investor will need to establish that

i) at the time of investing, the investor was aware of at least the essential elements
8:
of the relevant framework*" and

(ii) the (degree of) profitability of the investment depended materially on that
regulatory framework.

If the investor establishes both of the above, its claim that it relied on the Relative Stability
of the regulatory framework in question when making the investment will generally be
credible absent any special circumstances indicating otherwise.

With respect to point (i) above, the Claimant states that it was “very much aware of
RD 661/2007, [RDL] 6/2009 and RD 1614/2010 when it decided to invest”*'> The
Respondent, in turn, submits that “[Mr. Gomez] was a witness to all of those regulatory
changes from the time he began to invest in wind farms in the year 2000. Therefore, the
Claimant, entirely owned and administered by [Mr. Gomez], could not ignore the guiding
thread of these regulatory modifications.”*'® Similarly, in numerous instances, the
Respondent refers to elements of RFI that, according to the Respondent, the Claimant was
well aware of.5'” On this basis, the Tribunal has no doubt that the Claimant was in fact
aware, when it invested, of at least the essential elements of RF1. This is also corroborated
by the witness testimony of Mr. Gémez.*!*

As to point (ii) above, the Tribunal notes that electricity market prices are not high enough
to justify, by themselves, investment in renewable energy projects, including CSP and wind
technologies.*'? In fact, this is the very reason why RF1 offered (and RF3 still offers) feed-
in remuneration to renewable energy producers in an effort to create a level playing field

as compared to conventional energy production.*”° Specifically in relation to the Wind
Farms and CSP Plants, the Tribunal accepts that in 2014, feed-in remuneration made up
9-28% of the Wind Farms’ overall income,**! while for the CSP Plants, feed-in
remuneration made up 82-83% of their overall income in 2015.8” The Tribunal notes that
these numbers from 2014/2015 reflect the situation under RF3, which is less generous than
RFI in terms of feed-in remuneration payable to the Wind Farms and CSP Plants.
Accordingly, it is safe to assume that under RF1, feed-in remuneration accounted for an
even higher share of their overall remuneration. In any case, the Tribunal has no difficulty
to find that the profitability of the Claimant’s investment in the Wind Farms and CSP Plants
depended materially on RF1.

705 Consequently, the Tribunal accepts that the Claimant relied on the stability of RFl when
making the investment. Although it is not entirely clear from the Claimant’s submissions
whether it claims to have relied at the time on an expectation of Absolute or Relative
Stability,*? the Tribunal does not find this distinction decisive in the context of reliance.
An expectation of Absolute Stability, while not legitimate in the circumstances of the
present case, necessarily encompasses the less far-reaching expectation of Relative
Stability, on which the Claimant could legitimately rely.

706 Moreover, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant’s reliance on the Relative Stability of RF1
is not called into question by the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant failed to engage,
before making the investment, in any meaningful legal due diligence as to the stability of
the regulatory framework under which it invested.

707 ‘The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that, based on the record, the Claimant’s legal
due diligence in preparation of its investment was very limited, to say the least. However,
the Tribunal does not consider that a lack of legal due diligence is an indication of the
Claimant not having relied on the expectation of Relative Stability. Rather, if at all, a lack
of legal due diligence could raise the question of whether such reliance was misplaced, i.e.
whether the expectation relied upon was not legitimate. In this regard, however, the
Tribunal wishes to stress that legislative change only violates the notion of Relative
Stability if it exceeds the margin of change that a diligent investor — who, by definition,
conducted sufficient due diligence — could have foreseen. Accordingly, legal due diligence
on the part of the investor would not lead the investor to expect anything else than Relative
Stability. In other words, even if one considered that the ECT imposed a duty of a formal

820 See CMoM, {9199 (third bulet-point), 1059; RjoM, 91252. See also Law 24/2013 (C-0378/R-0076), Article 14(7):
“[...] The remuneration regime will not exceed the minimum level necessary to cover costs that allow facilities that

in the market and enable them to achieve a reasonable return [...]”, referred to in MoM, 770.

due diligence on investors*™ and even if the Claimant breached such duty, there would be
no causal link between this breach and the legitimacy of the expectation of Relative
Stability. Under these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that any lack of due diligence is
not an obstacle to the Claimant relying on the Relative Stability of the regulatory
framework under which it invested.°”5

This being so, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to make a finding on whether the
Claimant’s legal due diligence did in fact meet the standards required of a diligent investor.
Irrespective of whether this was the case, the Claimant placed reliance on the legitimate
expectation of Relative Stability.

Frustration of Legitimate Expectations by the Respondent
The Claimant’s Principal Arguments

According to the Claimant, the Respondent violated the Claimant’s legitimate expectations
by adopting the Disputed Measures, which first dismantled RF1 (through RF2) and then
replaced it with a completely different, internationally unprecedented and unreasonable
new regime (RF3). To the Claimant, this constitutes a radical change of policy that no
reasonable businessperson could have foreseen.*?° The Claimant avers that the
remunerative regime of RF3 applies retroactively back to the date on which the CSP Plants
and Wind Farms started producing energy, given that past gains are taken into account
when determining the remuneration to be paid under RF3. In the Claimant’s view, this
“mid-stream switch in the regulatory paradigm” thwarts, in and of itself, the Claimant’s
legitimate expectations, and also renders the new remunerative system inefficient.*?” In
addition, the Claimant submits that the level of remuneration offered by RF3, i.e. a pre-tax
IRR of 7.398%, is not only unreasonably low but also hypothetical, given that the true
remuneration is lower due to unrealistic assumptions in the calculations underlying this
purported IRR.*?8 Moreover, the Claimant asserts that it is unreasonable and unprecedented
to tie the feed-in remuneration to Spanish bond rates instead of to the cost of capital.*”?

The Claimant argues that this drastic change of the rules occurred only shortly after the
CSP Plants had started producing energy and had begun to benefit from the remuneration
as foreseen by RFI, and before the Wind Farms had even started receiving such

84 In this sense arguably Masdar v. Spain, $494 (but only “if general legislation is to be the source of the investor’s
legitimate expectations”) and Operafund v. Spain, [486; less clear Charanne v. Spain, 1505 (stating that the claimant
“should have” conducted due diligence, but not saying this is a requirement for protection, and subsequently assessing
only what would have been objectively foreseeable). By contrast, a requirement of “formal” or “extensive” due
diligence, respectively, is expressly denied in SolEs v. Spain, {331 and Isolux v. Spain, (781; similarly Cube v. Spain

remuneration.**° In the Claimant’s view, this resembles the facts of multiple other
arbitrations in which investors complied with all regulatory requirements but were
suddenly deprived of their rights precisely when they were scheduled to start benefitting
from their investment.**!

The Claimant adds that even if one followed the Respondent’s argument according to
which the only legitimate expectation that an investor could have had was to receive a
“reasonable return”, such return was quantified by the Respondent itself as a post-tax IRR
of up to 11% for the CSP Plants and up to 9% for the Wind Farms,** based on the
applicable levels of remuneration at the time the Claimant invested.*** In the Claimant’s
view, there was no justifiable reason for the Respondent to subsequently pursue a different
understanding of what level of return could be considered reasonable.***

The Respondent’s Principal Arguments

The Respondent submits that it has not violated any legitimate expectation of the Claimant
and that there was no radical change in its legislation.**> Specifically, it asserts that the
essential characteristics of the regulatory framework under which the Claimant invested
have been maintained, in particular the priority of access, the basic structure of the
compensation model (market price plus subsidy), the methodology for determining the
feed-in tariffs (by reference to efficient standard facilities) and the principle of a dynamic
reasonable return.8*° Moreover, the Respondent contends that the return offered under RF3
is objectively reasonable, irrespective of whether one compares it to the cost of capital, the
profitability in other regulated sectors in Spain or the proposal made in 2009 by the
association of renewable energy producers “Asociacién de Productores de Energias
Renovables” (“APPA”) and Greenpeace, who were advised by the law firm representing
the Claimant in this arbitration.**’ In addition, the Respondent asserts that contrary to the
Claimant’s argument, the investment costs contemplated in RF3 are in fact realistic, as
proven by the fact that they correspond to the projected investment costs for the CSP
Plants.*%*

Furthermore, the Respondent asserts that contrary to the Claimant’s argument, the Disputed
Measures are not retroactive in nature, neither within the meaning of international law nor

830 The transitional period of RD 661/20007, which the Wind Farms had opted to be subject to and which allowed
them to continue receiving remuneration as provided for under RD 436/2004, expired on the same day that
RDL 2/2013 came into force retroactively.

under Spanish domestic law. According to the Respondent, this follows in particular from
the fact that the Claimant never had any acquired or vested rights to future compensation,
sine die, through a fixed level of feed-in remuneration. The fact alone that the Disputed
Measures affect also existing installations does not make those measures retroactive, in the
Respondent’s view. The Respondent acknowledges that RF3 takes into account the
remuneration already received by the relevant facility from the beginning of its operation.
However, the Respondent claims that this merely concerns the calculation of the facility’s
future remuneration, meaning that past payments are respected even if they exceeded a
reasonable return.5?

Finally, the Respondent objects to the Claimant’s alternative argument that it was at least
entitled to rely on the IRRs underlying RF1, submitting that the Claimant has failed to
establish that this return was guaranteed to remain the same over time.*4?

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal’s findings on the issue of whether the Respondent frustrated the Claimant’s
legitimate expectations reflect the view of the majority, with Arbitrator Sands dissenting.

In order to determine whether the Disputed Measures violated the Claimant’s legitimate
expectation of Relative Stability, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to make a global
assessment of the criteria identified in {681 supra. Accordingly, the Tribunal will first
analyse each of these criteria in turn (see subsections (1) to (7) infra) and then decide
whether, taking the results of the analyses together, the Respondent violated the
expectation of Relative Stability (see subsection (8) infra).

(1) Magnitude of the Change

The Parties’ views differ greatly as to how similar or dissimilar RF1 and RF3 are. While
the Respondent claims that the Disputed Measures were merely an “evolution of the
regulatory system”**! that maintained the essential characteristics of RF1, the Claimant
asserts they resulted in “a complete overhaul” of RF1 that constituted “’a mid-stream
switch’ of the regulatory paradigm” 5

In determining the true magnitude of the change brought about by the Disputed Measures,
the Tribunal finds it useful to look at each of the main components of the changes from
RF1 to RF3 in turn (see subsections (a) to (h) infra), before assessing their overall
magnitude (see subsection (i) infra). As a preliminary remark, the Tribunal wishes to
highlight that the magnitude of the change will be determined solely based on those
elements of the Disputed Measures for which the Claimant was able to establish that they

abstract exercise but is rather meant to inform the Tribunal whether a breach of the FET
standard occurred specifically in relation to the Claimant’s investment.

(a) Level of Remuneration Deemed Reasonable by the Respondent

The Tribunal agrees, in principle, with the Respondent’s position that the guiding principle
for the remuneration under RF1 was the objective of achieving a reasonable rate of return
on the part of investors. While the Claimant essentially alleges that this principle of
reasonable return was made up by the Respondent ad hoc for the purposes of avoiding
liability in investment arbitrations such as the present one,**? the Tribunal finds this
characterization irreconcilable both with the wording of the relevant pieces of legislation
and with contemporaneous authoritative statements thereon. In particular, Article 30(4) of
Law 54/1997 expressly provided that the objective of premiums to the market price was to
“achieve reasonable rates of profitability”.*44 Moreover, the preamble of RD 661/2007
made clear that RD 661/2007 was meant to pursue this very objective, by stating that it
“develops the principles provided in Law 54/1997 [...] guaranteeing [...] a reasonable
return” 55 The Spanish Supreme Court, in turn, ruled on 25 October 2006 that Law
54/1997 and the implementing Royal Decree that set the remuneration values*° guaranteed
a reasonable return, but not specific levels of remuneration.*4” Similarly, on 29 March
2007, the Respondent’s Chief State Attorney opined that the “only thing that the
Government is under obligation to do is to establish a reasonable rate of return” *° In
respect of the renewable energy sector itself, the observations filed by AEE on the draft of
RD 1614/2010 (see {194 supra) likewise show that the jurisprudence of the Spanish
Supreme Court was well understood. In particular in view of that clear jurisprudence, the
Tribunal is also unable to follow the Claimant’s argument that the principle of reasonable
return as laid down in Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997 was merely a “directive to the
regulator” **° while investors were entitled to rely on the remuneration values set in the
relevant Royal Decree.

That said, at least from the perspective of the ECT’s FET standard, the Tribunal shares the
Claimant’s view that such guiding principle of a reasonable return cannot serve as a carte
blanche that would allow the Respondent to change the remuneration at its will in relation
to investments that were made in reliance of the previous regime. The Tribunal accepts, as
claimed by the Respondent, that the principle may have a dynamic character in the sense
that what is reasonable depends on the circumstances, which may change over time.
However, this does not mean that there are no limits to the Respondent re-defining its

understanding of what is a reasonable return. Instead, also in this regard, the Respondent
is bound by the legitimate expection of Relative Stability.

It is undisputed that between RF1 and RF3, the Respondent changed its view as to which
level of return is reasonable. In order to determine the extent of this change, the Tribunal
will first identify the positions taken by the Respondent under each regulatory framework
(see subsection (i) infra), then convert the post-tax IRR underlying RF1 into pre-tax
numbers (see subsection (ii) infra) and finally compare the latter to the pre-tax IRR targeted
by RF3 (see subsection (iii) infra).

(i) Positions Taken by the Respondent under RF 1 and RF3

The Tribunal finds that under RFI, the IRR that the Respondent sought to achieve
(hereinafter the “RF1 Reference IRR”) was 7% for the Wind Farms and 8% for the CSP
Plants, both post-tax and excluding financing. Besides other documents, these numbers
were expressly mentioned in the press release accompanying RD 661/2007 as the rates of
return that the Regulated Tariff sought to achieve for the respective technology.

The Tribunal is well aware that for the Pool Price Plus Premium option, the same document
indicated a range of 5-9% for the Wind Farms and 7-11% for the CSP Plants, based on
which the Claimant argues that the Respondent is estopped from invoking in this arbitration
a RFI Reference IRR of less than 11% for the CSP Plants and less than 9% for the Wind
Farms.**° The Tribunal also notes that the Wind Farms indeed always operated under the
Pool Price Plus Premium option (for as long as it existed), and the Tribunal finds it likely
that the CSP Plants would likewise have chosen to do so, in line with industry practice.*°!
However, the IRR underlying the Pool Price Plus Premium option depends on the uncertain
development of market prices, which is why it was expressed as a range in the documents
underlying/accompanying RD 661/2007. For this reason alone, it does not seem
appropriate to simply use the upper end of the range, as the Claimant suggests. In addition,
the methodology behind the setting of the premiums was intended to achieve the same IRR
in the Pool Price Plus Premium option as in the Regulated Tariff.** Therefore, the Tribunal
finds it preferable to use the IRRs underlying the Regulated Tariff for the purposes of
comparing RF1 with RF3.5°?

RF3, in turn, introduced a target IRR of 7.398% pre-tax (hereinafter the “RF3 Target
IRR”).

(ii) Conversion of RFI Reference IRR into Pre-tax Numbers

In order to be able to compare the RFI Reference IRR to the RF3 Target IRR, it is necessary
to either convert the latter into post-tax numbers or the former into pre-tax numbers. The
Tribunal finds it more appropriate to compare pre-tax numbers. In particular, this
eliminates the risk that any changes in Spanish tax laws between 2007 (when RF1 was
promulgated) and 2014 (when RF3 was completed) could influence the comparison
between the IRRs that the Respondent sought to achieve with these two regulatory
frameworks. While neither party made any submissions on any amendments to Spanish tax
laws beyond the TVPEE and TEE, this does not necessarily mean that no such amendments
were made for a period of seven years. As no taxation measures (beyond the TVPEE and
TEE) were challenged by the Claimant, and as any such measures would risk falling outside
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction due to Article 21(1) ECT, it would seem inappropriate for them
to influence the present analysis.***

In order to be able to convert the post-tax RF1 Reference IRR into pre-tax numbers, it is
necessary to determine the effective tax rate governing this conversion. In its second
regulatory expert report, Brattle used effective tax rates of 17.3% for the CSP Plants and
13.2% for the Wind Farms.*** Accuracy adopted these rates in at least some of its
calculations.**° However, subsequent submissions of Brattle shed doubt on whether these
effective tax rates were in fact correct, at least in respect of the Wind Farms.**” Therefore,
the Tribunal requested the Experts to confirm the correct effective tax rates for both the
CSP Plants and the Wind Farms.

The Experts, however, were unable to agree on effective tax rates because they took
different views on the correct approach to depreciation. Brattle’s position is that the
effective tax rate should be calculated on the basis of straight-line depreciation of the fixed
assets. By contrast, Accuracy’s view is that the effective tax rate should be calculated based
on accelerated depreciation. These different views entail significant differences in the tax
rates calculated by the Experts.***

In support of its approach, Brattle argues that it would be consistent for the Tribunal to use
the depreciation methodology employed by the Respondent when it set the feed-in
remuneration values in the first place. Brattle claims that the Respondent has consistently
assumed straight-line depreciation. In this respect, Brattle refers to the PER 2005, which
stated that

854 Also, it is not entirely clear to the Tribunal whether the effective tax rates submitted by the Experts included the
effects of the TVPEE and TEE; if they did, this would mean that the post-tax IRRs under RF3 calculated based on
those tax rates would be lower than they should be for the purposes of the Tribunal’s analysis, given the Tribunal’s
lack of jurisdiction over the TVPEE and TEE. This provides another reason for looking at pre-tax numbers.

855 See BRR II, fn. 265, 267.

856 See Accuracy II, 145.

857 Cf. the Experts’ Joint Memorandum of 9 November 2020, {{15. While Brattle calculates effective tax rates under
RFI of 21.5% for the CSP Plants and 24.1% for the Wind Farms, Accuracy calculates 14.0% and 14.1%, respectively.

the generation costs study is carried out considering an investment financed with 100% equity,
without aids or deductions [....]. The useful life period is 25 years, as is the depreciation period.°?
(emphi dded by Brattle)

 

 

While agreeing with Accuracy that accelerated depreciation is an advantageous tax option
in Spain and that it is economically reasonable to assume that investors would have decided
to use this benefit, Brattle argues that the Respondent decided to disregard the options of
debt financing and accelerated depreciation when setting the feed-in remuneration of RF1.
Therefore, according to Brattle, the Respondent created the opportunity for investors to
earn more than the RF1 Reference IRR if investors managed to finance their projects with
debt and/or to secure the ability to accelerate depreciation. Brattle submits that the
Claimant managed to do both and that it is reasonable for it to retain the efficiency benefits
so created. Brattle contends that otherwise, i.e. if one applied accelerated depreciation as
suggested by Accuracy, one would appropriate the tax benefits that investors expected to
retain under RF1.5°°

Accuracy, in turn, points out that in line with accelerated depreciation being the preferred
choice for investors, the Experts agreed on using that approach when calculating damages
in the Joint Model.**! Accuracy argues that if the idea is to compare the two regulatory
frameworks with each other and/or to compare a given regulatory framework with the
actual and but-for scenarios deriving from the Joint Model, such comparison is only
meaningful if the same depreciation method is used throughout.*

Moreover, Accuracy contends that the Respondent did not in fact consistently disregard
the possibility of accelerated depreciation when devising the regulatory framework for
renewables. In particular, according to Accuracy, the PER 2005 referenced by Brattle does
not in fact mention any specific depreciation method, but merely the depreciation period.*°

In any case, Accuracy argues that for determining the effective tax rate in each regulatory
framework, it is irrelevant whether the Respondent contemplated straight-line depreciation
when it set the feed-in remuneration of RF1. In this context, Accuracy also rejects Brattle’s
analogy to the Respondent having disregarded the benefits of external financing in
determining target returns. According to Accuracy, while external financing is an
individual choice that may increase the equity returns but involves additional risks (namely
losing the entire investment if cash-flows are not sufficient to service the debt), accelerated
depreciation is a feature of Spanish tax legislation that comes without any risk to the
investor, meaning that it is not a matter of an efficient choice to beat one or the other
regulatory framework.’

733 On balance, the Tribunal finds Accuracy’s positions more convincing for the following
reasons.

734 First, it has not been established that the RF1 Reference IRRs were in fact based on straight-
line depreciation. As correctly noted by Accuracy, the quote from the PER 2005 invoked
by Brattle does not in fact say anything about which depreciation method the Respondent
contemplated.*° In addition, it is unclear whether the remuneration assumptions
underlying RF1 were fully identical to those developed in the PER 2005 — the latter was
issued almost two years before the enactment of RD 661/2007 and was vaguer regarding
the IRRs the Respondent sought to achieve compared to subsequent legislative material
related to RD 661/2007.5%

735 Secondly, the Experts agree that in order to allow for any meaningful comparison, one must
be consistent on the depreciation method used. Brattle has not disputed that the Joint Model
contemplates accelerated depreciation, as did Brattle’s own damage calculations.
Therefore, if one seeks (as the Tribunal does**’) to compare the IRRs targeted by RF1/RF3
with the actual and but-for IRRs of the Claimant’s facilities as calculated in the Joint Model
or by Brattle, such comparison is only meaningful if one assumes accelerated depreciation
also when converting the IRRs underlying RF1 and RF3 from post-tax to pre-tax or vice-
versa.

736 ‘Thirdly, the Tribunal asked the Experts for the effective tax rate for a specific purpose,
namely to ascertain the economic impact that the Disputed Measures had on the Claimant’s
individual facilities. Brattle has confirmed that the Claimant’s facilities do use accelerated
depreciation. Nonetheless applying straight-line depreciation would create a risk of
distorting the effect of the Disputes Measures with theoretical tax effects that are not
relevant to the facilities in question and, therefore, to the purpose of the Tribunal’s analysis.

737 _ Finally, the effective tax rates initially used by Brattle in its second regulatory expert report
(and adopted by Accuracy in its second expert report) are much closer to those now
calculated by Accuracy than to those now calculated by Brattle. The significant differences
between Brattle’s initial calculations and its new ones, in particular for the Wind Farms,
shed additional doubt on the reasonability of Brattle’s latest position on the depreciation
method.

865 For the sake of completeness, it does not seem as if the additional references that Brattle sought to introduce in the

Experts’ Joint Memorandum of 16 December 2020 would have helped the Claimant’s case: One reference concerns
isolated tables from the 1989 (sic!) Renewable Energy Plan, which do not seem capable of enlightening the Tribunal
on Spain’s considerations behind RFI almost 20 years later. The other reference is to certain financial models
underlying the PER 2005 that were disclosed by Spain in other arbitrations, which models Brattle claims were based
on straight-line depreciation; even if this was true, the Tribunal is unable to consider t in the present arbitration,
where those models are not part of the record.

866 While the PER 2005 referred to an IRR of “around 7%”, the press releases accompanying the first draft and final
versions of RD 661/2007 indicated 7% for wind farms and 8% for CSP plants under the Regulated Tariff, and 5-9%
respectively 7-1 1% under the Pool Price Plus Premium option.

867 See 4857 infra.

TAL

Therefore, any conversion between post-tax and pre-tax numbers in the analysis below is
based on the effective tax rates submitted by Accuracy.

(iii) Comparison between RF1 and RF3

Using the effective tax rates submitted by Accuracy, the RF] Reference IRR is 8.1% pre-
tax for the Wind Farms and 9.3% pre-tax for the CSP Plants.*® Accordingly, RF1 and RF3
compare as follows:

 

Wind Farms CSP Plants

 

RF1 Reference IRR 8.1% 9.3%

 

 

 

RF3 Target IRR

 

*In this table and all following tables comparing IRRs or cash-flows, red colour denotes numbers that are
lower than the relevant benchmark (here: the RF1 Reference IRR), while green colour denotes numbers that
exceed the relevant benchmark.

The Tribunal finds that already this nominal reduction of the IRR that the Respondent seeks
to achieve is significant.* The Tribunal is of course aware that RF1 provided for a rate of
return that is reasonable with reference to “the cost of money on the capital markets” 5”
Hence, if the cost of capital decreased, it might be said that a corresponding change of the
reasonable rate of return would be in line with what a reasonable investor had to expect
under RF1. However, based on the 10-year average of Spanish 10-year bonds, which the
Respondent itself uses in RF3 as a proxy for the cost of money in the capital market,*”! it
seems that the cost of money was roughly the same at the time the Claimant invested and
when the Disputed Measures were enacted.*”” Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the change
in the Respondent’s assessment of what is a reasonable rate of return cannot be explained
by a corresponding fall in the cost of money in the capital market.

In addition, there seems to be some truth to the Claimant’s assertion that the RF3 Target
IRR is more difficult for real-life facilities to achieve than was the RF1 Reference IRR. In
this regard, the Tribunal finds it useful to look at how the Wind Farms’ and CSP Plants’
IRRs in the actual scenario perform against the the RF3 Target IRR, compared to how their

868 See the Experts’ Joint Memorandum of 16 December 2020, 44 (Table 2).

86° For completeness, the Tribunal notes that had it compared post-tax numbers (excluding financing), RF3 would
offer an IRR of 6.049% for the Wind Farms and 6.225% for the CSP Plants, which is 13.6% respectively 22.2% lower
than RFI. The Tribunal does not consider that using these numbers would materially change the analysis.

identical in substance); to same effect RD 661/2007 (C-0064/R-0101), Article 44(3).

Accordingly, while under RFI the Wind Farms could be expected to outperform the RF1
Reference IRR, the very same facilities can now be expected to stay significantly below
the RF3 Target IRR. Similarly, while already under RF1 the CSP Plants could be expected
to remain below the RF1 Reference IRR, the shortfall between their forecast actual IRRs
and the RF3 Target IRR is much bigger. Even though the Tribunal cannot rule out that, as
alleged by the Respondent, certain inefficiencies at the Claimant’s facilities have an
adverse effect on their IRRs, such inefficiencies do not explain why under RF3 all facilities
compare much less favourably to the relevant benchmark than they did under RFI.
Therefore, the above analysis appears to confirm that the RF3 Target IRR is more difficult
to achieve for real-life facilities such as the Wind Farms and CSP Plants than was the case
with the RF1 Reference IRR.

The lowering of the IRR that the Respondent sought to achieve, combined with the
apparently more demanding assumptions that need to be met by real-life facilities in order
to reach the target, leads the Tribunal to conclude that the Respondent’s understanding of
which level of feed-in remuneration was reasonable changed significantly between RF1
and RF3.

(b) New Remunerative System and the Incentives It Creates for Producers

A first change to the remuneration system was implemented by RF2, with RDL 2/2013
effectively abolishing the Pool Price Plus Premium Option. However, the Tribunal notes
that this change merely concerned a period of little more than half a year, until RDL 9/2013
introduced RF3. In addition, the Pool Price Plus Premium option had anyway been meant
to achieve the same average rate of return as the Regulated Tariff.*”* Therefore, the
Tribunal finds that the magnitude of this particular change of the remunerative system was
quite limited.

As to RF3, the Tribunal is not convinced by the Claimant’s argument that it is unreasonable
and unprecedented to tie the feed-in remuneration to Spanish bond rates instead of to the
cost of capital. First, the Tribunal notes that both Parties considered those very bond rates
to be a suitable proxy for the “cost of money on the capital markets” as referred to by RF1,
ie. the regulatory framework under which the Claimant invested.’’> On this basis alone,
the Tribunal is unable to accept the Claimant’s argument that RF3 using the same proxy is
unreasonable or unprecedented. Secondly, even if it was true that no other State tied feed-
in remuneration to bond rates of that State, this would not by itself be sufficient to establish
that bond rates are an unreasonable benchmark. Thirdly, the fact that the draft bill published
by APPA and Greenpeace in 2009 likewise tied the feed-in remuneration to Spanish bond
rates is a further indication that such approach is neither unprecedented nor unreasonable
per se.

Equally, the Tribunal is unable to accept the Claimant’s allegation that RF3 introduced a
new methodology for calculating tariffs by looking at the characteristics of pre-defined
standard facilities rather than taking into account the characteristics of the individual
facility in question. To the Tribunal, it is clear that this methodology of setting
remuneration values based on standard facilities was a guiding thread throughout the
different stages of RF1.5”6 First, already in the PER 2000 and the PER 2005, which are
referred to in Law 54/1997 and the implementing RDs,*” the calculation model was based
on standard projects that were defined according to technical economic parameters.*”*
Secondly, based on the economic report that accompanied the draft of RD 436/2004, the
same methodology was pursued in this precursor regulation to RD 661/2007.8” Thirdly,
the Ministry of Energy’s report on the draft of RD 661/2007 expressly states that
categories, groups and sub-groups have been changed so as to ensure a reasonable return

“for each standard project’.*®° Fourthly, RD 661/2007 itself refers to such standard
projects, in particular in Article 44(4), which concerns the quarterly update of the main
remuneration values, and authorizes the CNE for this purpose to

on the investments, costs, revenues, and other paramet

ties [...] and to gather information

747  Fifthly, the Tribunal finds the Claimant’s assertion difficult to square with Articles 35-43
of RD 661/2007, which provide for different remuneration values for numerous groups and
sub-groups of facilities.

748 However, despite the fact that the methodology for calculating the remuneration values
thus remained materially the same, the Tribunal shares the Claimant’s view that there was
still a significant change in the remunerative system. This is because, under RF1, the feed-
in remuneration was exclusively a function of the amount of energy produced. This, in
turn, incentivized maximum production up until the cap of annual operating hours.**? By
contrast, under RF3, the feed-in remuneration for the Wind Farms is limited to RInv, which
depends solely on the installed capacity and is, thus, independent of the amount of energy
actually produced.**? Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s argument that
contrary to RFI, the feed-in remuneration offered by RF3 provides the Wind Farms with
no incentive at all (in addition to the pool price***) to maximize production. While the CSP
Plants receive also ROp, i.e. the second component of the feed-in remuneration under RF3,
which is a function of the energy produced, the Respondent has not disputed that this makes
up only a small part of the total feed-in remuneration received.**> The larger part is
therefore likewise paid through RInv. Accordingly, the CSP Plants at least have a reduced

880 Ministry of Energy, Report of 21 March 2007 (R-0081), section 2.1. While the Tribunal is aware that the Claimant
asserts this Report was an internal document disclosed only in this arbitration, the Tribunal does not find the public or
not nature of this document relevant to the question of whether the methodology changed between RFI and RF3. Also,
the Tribunal notes that the Claimant itself relied on the same document in RoM, {1448. In any case, the Tribunal does
not find this document decisive, given the other evidence for the methodology used in RFI.

883 See MoM, 802; BRR I, 176; BRR II, (186.

884 The Experts agree that the pool price can be expected to exceed the Wind Farm’s operating costs, see the Experts’
Joint Memorandum of 21 May 2021, 6(c). Accordingly, even without any feed-in remuneration for the energy
delivered to the grid, there is an incentive to keep operating the Wind Farms.

885 See MoM, 801; see also BRR II, (186.

  

175

incentive to produce more than the Minimum Operating Hours,** or to continue operating
after 25 years.*87

749 The problem with the above-described change in the remuneration system and in the
associated economic incentives is that the initial investment costs for constructing CSP
plants or Wind farms, which are sunken costs, make up the largest portion of the overall
investment in such facilities.*** Accordingly, if an investor decided to invest more into the
construction of its facilities in order to maximize production, e.g. by choosing more
efficient and durable components, this may well have been an efficient investment decision
under RFI (given its focus on energy produced). However, the same choice can be rendered
inefficient by RF3 (given its focus on the installed capacity), without the investor being
able to react to this change of the remunerative system.

750 Especially for the Claimant’s Wind Farms, this seems confirmed by the numbers provided
in {741 supra: The facilities were efficient by the Respondent’s own standards at the time
because they could be expected to beat the RF1 Reference IRR; with the adoption of RF3,
however, they became inefficient by the Respondent’s standards because they can now be
expected to fall short of the (even lower) RF3 Target IRR.**?

751 In light of the above, the Tribunal considers that as far as the system of remuneration as
such is concerned, there was indeed a paradigm shift, at least for facilities that were
constructed before RF3 was adopted (as is the case of the Claimant’s facilities).

(c) Introduction of Regulatory Lifespan

752 While RFI reduced the remuneration values for the Wind Farms as of year 20, and for the
CSP Plants as of year 25, both the Wind Farms and the CSP Plants would continue to
receive feed-in remuneration based on these reduced values for the remainder of their
lifetime. By contrast, RF3 provides that no feed-in remuneration at all is paid after the end

886 Above this limit, while the CSP Plants continue to receive ROp, this merely serves to cover the shortfall between
expected pool prices and standard operating costs, not to generate profit (see {{[758, 797 infra). That said, if the actual
pool prices are higher than the sum of the CSP Plant’s actual operating costs and ROp, there would still be an incentive
to maximize production (up to the Maximum Operating Hours, beyond which no ROp is paid). In this regard, the
Tribunal notes that in 2014, both CSP Plants did produce significantly more than the Minimum Operating Hours, see
BQR-109 and BQR-110 (even if one looks only at solar production, i.e. disregards the use of Back-up Fuel, as the
Claimant asserts that the CSP Plants had contracts requiring the continued purchase of natural gas up until 2014, see
Brattle’s Memorandum of 22 September 2020, 415). This seems to indicate that there was still some economic benefit
in maximizing production beyond the Minimum Operating Hours that year.

887 Because no ROp is paid after 25 hours (see section (c) infra) and the forecast pool prices will not be sufficient to
cover operating costs, see the Experts’ Joint Memorandum of 4 June 2021, 48.

888 See BRR I, 140; Accuracy I, (9112, 526, 531.

889 As to the CSP Plants, while it can be expected that they would have fallen short of the RFI Reference IRR, this
does not nece: ly mean that they were inefficient in the sense of the investment not being viable economically; it
merely means that they were less efficient than the standard facilities underlying the Respondent’s calculations. That
said, under RF3, this shortfall became much bigger.

of the Regulatory Lifespan, which is defined as 20 years for the Wind Farms and 25 years
for the CSP Plants.°”°

In theory, this is a change that does not seem insignificant. The Tribunal finds, however,
that the Claimant has failed to establish that, in reality, this change has any adverse effect
on the Wind Farms or CSP Plants.

In respect of the CSP Plants, the Tribunal’s assumption*”! is that their lifetime is anyway
limited to 25 years. This deprives the cut of feed-in remuneration after this point in time of
any practical effect.

As regards the Wind Farms, the Tribunal’s assumption is that they would operate 25
years.**? Accordingly, by eliminating feed-in remuneration after 20 years, RF3 deprives
the Wind Farms of five years of feed-in remuneration. That said, the Tribunal notes that
the Wind Farms do not receive any ROp payments anyway. Consequently, they are only
deprived of five years of RInv payments. However, based on the record, the Tribunal is not
convinced that this results in any harm to the Claimant. It is undisputed that RInv is meant
to cover the initial investment costs of a standard facility, to the extent they will not be
offset through operating income, and is paid by means of annual instalments that stretch
until the end of the Regulatory Lifespan (unless, taking into account payments received
under RF1, the Wind Farms reach the target IRR before that point in time).* To the
Tribunal, it seems to follow from this logic that if the Regulatory Lifespan were prolonged,
the overall amount in RInv payments would not change. Instead, payment of this same
overall amount would be stretched over a longer period of time.** Therefore, if RF3 had
determined the regulatory useful life of the Wind Farms to be 25 years, it appears that it
would have taken the Wind Farms five more years to receive the same amount. Given the
need to discount future cash-flow, this would seem to rather have an adverse effect on the
investment, as compared to the actual Regulatory Lifespan of 20 years.

In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant, being the party bearing the
burden of proof, has failed to establish that the introduction of a Regulatory Lifespan was
a change that adversely affected its investment.

824f., 827f.; CMoM, 573F., 584, 588, 592.

84 The Tribunal also notes that the formula for calculating RInv in RD 413/2014 (C-0399/R-0110), Article 16(2) is a
function of the residual Regulatory Lifespan of the facility in question.

(d) Cap on Annual Operating Hours Qualifying for Feed-in Remuneration

757 Already under RFI, there had been a cap on annual operating hours qualifying for feed-in
remuneration.®®> RF3 reduced this cap to 0 for the Wind Farms (from 2,589) and to 2,040
for the CSP Plants (from 2,855).5%°

758 Regarding the Wind Farms, the Tribunal does not find this reduction to add anything to the
considerations set out above on the change of the remuneration system. This is because the
setting of the cap on annual operating hours to 0 is merely the technical tool through which
RF3 avoids the payment of any ROp to the Wind Farms. The ROp serves the sole purpose
of covering any shortfall between the operating costs and the pool price, while the RInv is
meant to cover investment costs and allow for a reasonable rate of return. As neither party
has challenged the assumption underlying RF3 that the relevant standard facilities’
operating costs are exceeded by the pool price,*”’ the suppression of any ROp for those
installations is inherent to the logic of the new remuneration system. Therefore, the
Tribunal finds that the reduction of the cap on annual hours does not constitute a further
restriction on the Wind Farms (in addition to the change of the remunerative system) that
would need to be considered when determining the magnitude of the legislative change.

759 The situations is different for the CSP Plants, given that they do receive ROp. However,
the Tribunal finds that in the absence of any provision to the contrary, the previous cap, as
fixed by RFI, must be taken to have contemplated that CSP plants could produce up to
15%*°8 of their total energy production through Back-up Fuel.**? By contrast, it is the
Claimant’s own position that the new cap on annual operating hours does not contemplate
any use of Back-up Fuel at all.° Thus, to appreciate the ‘net’ reduction of the cap on
annual operating hours, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to eliminate the effect of the new
rule on Back-up Fuel (which is discussed separately below) by deducting from the old cap
on annual operating hours the 15% of Back-up Fuel included therein. This adjusted old cap
is approximately 2,427 hours.”?! Consequently, the new cap of 2,040 hours reflects a

85 RD 1614/2010 (C-0066/R-0105), Article 2(3) and (4).

896 See 237 supra.

897 Indeed, the Expers agree that the Wind Farms(forecast) operating costs are lower than (forecast) pool prices, see
the Experts’ Joint Memorandum of 21 May 2021, §6(c).

8°8 In the Pool Price Plus Premium scenario. While the Tribunal’s analysis of the remunerative system rests on the
Regulated Tariff scenario, this does not change the fact that the cap of 2,855 annual operating hours, which applied to
both tariff options alike, contemplated up to 15% of LNG energy production.

8 As acknowledged by Brattle in its Memorandum of 22 September 2020, {{18. In respect of RF3, Accuracy is
likewise of the view that due to the lack of any explanation to the contrary, the cap must be understood to include
energy produced through the burning of LNG, see its Memorandum of 21 September 2020, §[24.

© Brattle’s Memorandum of 5 August 2020, 63. The Tribunal notes that this assertion does not seem to be accurate,
given that RF3 does allow for Back-up Fuel in an amount of up to 15,000 thermal MWh. However, the Claimant’s
assertion is more detrimental to its own case as regards the effect of the reduction of the cap on annual operating hours.
Therefore, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to work off the Claimant’s assertion in this regard, given that the Claimant
bears the burden of proof for the alleged violation of its legitimate expectations.

901 2.855 operating hours x 0.85% = 2,426.75 operating hours.

decrease of the cap by approximately 16% if one eliminates the effect of the new rule on
Back-up Fuel.*°

760 ‘That said, the Tribunal is not convinced that this nominal reduction of the cap has any
practical adverse impact on the CSP Plants. This is because the CSP Plants’ forecast
production (without Back-up Fuel) does not exceed the new cap on operating hours,
irrespective of whether one looks at the Claimant’s own contemporaneous forecast,”? the
Claimant’s calculation of a hypothetical bank case without Back-up Fuel™ or, as the
Tribunal finds most appropriate, an average of the bank case and the Claimant’s
contemporaneous forecast.” In fact, the Claimant’s own experts have acknowledged that

[t]he Disputed Measures have [...] a limited and measurable effect on their production. The key
effect on production involves the elimination of support for electricity produced using natural
gas [...]. The New Regulatory Regime did not affect the extent of production that came solely
from solar energy. (emphasis added)

 

761 Accordingly, the Tribunal is not convinced that the reduction of the cap on operating hours,
while not insignificant in the abstract, has any concrete adverse effect on the CSP Plants.

(e) Reduction of CSP Plants’ Maximum Energy Production through Back-up Fuel
Qualifying for Feed-in Remuneration

762 Under RFI, the maximum amount of energy produced through Back-up Fuel that would
qualify for feed-in remuneration was 12 or 15% of the CSP Plants’ total energy production

92 2,040 operating hours / 2,427 operating hours = 84.05%.The Tribunal notes for completeness that if one acted on

the assumption that the new cap on annual operating hours included the amount of Back-up Fuel allowed by RF3, one
would need to add roughly 4,200 MWh (corresponding to 15,000 thermal MWh according to the conversion ratio
indicated in Brattle’s Memorandum of 22 September 2020, fn. 27), i.e. 84 operating hours (4,200 MWh / 50 MW), to
the operating hours as calculated in the previous footnote, yielding an adjusted old cap of 2,510.75. Accordingly, the
new cap would reflect of a decrease by approximately 19% (2,040 operating hours / 2,510.75 operating hours =
81.25%).

93 According to Brattle’s Memorandum of 22 September 2020, #9[14f., the forecast from 2015 is the one relied on by
Brattle in its calculations for the period after January 2013 in the actual scenario. That forecast indicated net annual
power generation (without Back-up Fuel) of 99,442 MWh for Morén and 101,993 MHw for Olivenza (see the excel
sheet “BQR-59 Renergy CSP — Economic and Operating data”, tab “Key Asssumtions”, line 22, columns F and G).
This corresponds to 1,988.84 and 2,039.86 annual operating hours, respectively, for these 50 MW plants.

94 Net annual power generation of 80,358 MWh for Morén and 84,696 MWh for Olivenza (see Accuracy’s
Memorandum of 21 September 2020, 22 (Table 4)), corresponding to 1,607.16 and 1,693.92 annual operating hours,
respectively. For completeness, the Respondent’s calculation for the bank case without gas is 102,960 MWh for Morén
and 101,552 MWh for Olivenza (see ibid.). This corresponds to 2,059.2 and 2,031.04 annual operating hours,
respectively. While Morén would therefore slightly exceed the cap of 2,040 under the Respondent’s calculation for
the bank case, the Tribunal does not consider this decisive. Apart from the marginal effect that the cap would have in
this case (curtailing 19.2 or less than 1% of Morén’s operating hours), the Tribunal considers it more appropriate to
build an average between the Claimant’s contemporaneous forecast and the Respondent’s calculation of the bank case,
see {822-828 infra. This average is below the cap of 2,040, see the next footnote.

%°5 See [822 infra. Based on the Claimant’s calculation for the bank case, the averages are 89,900 MWh for Mor6n
and 93,345 MWh for Olivenza, corresponding to 1,798.00 and 1,866.90 annual operating hours, respectively. Based
on the Respondent’s calculation for the bank case, the averages are 101,201 MWh for Morén and 101,773 for
Olivenza, corresponding to 2,024.02 and 2,035.42 annual operating hours, respectively.

(depending on whether the Regulated Tariff or the Pool Price Plus Premium applied). RF3
reduced this maximum amount to 15,000 thermal MWh, which equals approximately 4%
of the energy produced by a 50 MW plant such as the CSP Plants.” According to the
Claimant, this change alone was so damaging to the CSP Plants that it would have justified
an FET claim in and of itself.°°*

763 The Tribunal notes that, already under RF1, the use of Back-up Fuel was explicitly limited
to necessary technical purposes, specifically the “maintenance of the temperature of the
heat transmitter fluid compensating for an absence of solar irradiation that may affect the
planned supply of energy”, with 12/15% being the absolute limit for such use.*” Therefore,
in the Tribunal’s view, one cannot say that RF1 provided an unqualified right to receive
feed-in remuneration for 12 or 15% production through Back-up Fuel in any case, i.e.
irrespective of whether the Back-up Fuel was used for necessary technical purposes.
Instead, the cap of 12/15% was relevant only if the prescribed technical purpose required
using a higher amount of Back-up Fuel. The Tribunal is not convinced that this is generally
the case. In fact, already in 2012, the CNE estimated that a mere 5% of a CSP plant’s
overall energy production is sufficient for technical purposes.?'° Also, the Claimant, being
the party bearing the burden of proving a violation of its legitimate expectations, never
asserted that the amount of Back-up Fuel still qualifying for feed-in remuneration under
RF3 is insufficient for technical purposes.?!! Instead, the Claimant simply argued that it
was entitled to use and receive feed-in remuneration for Back-up Fuel up to 12/15% of the
total energy production, which the Tribunal finds is an inaccurate description of what RF1
provided.

764 ~=Therefore, the Tribunal does not find it established that the mere reduction of the maximum
amount of Back-up Fuel qualifying for feed-in remuneration adversely effected the average
CSP plant (or the CSP Plants). Instead, based on the record, the Tribunal agrees with the
Respondent that RF3 merely adapted the estimate of the amount of Back-up Fuel needed
to fulfil the purposes to which the use of fuel had been restricted already by RF1.°!? This

97 15,000 thermal MWh = approximately 4,200 electrical MWh (see fn. 902 supra). Dividing this by the overall
energy produced by a SOMW plant within the maximum of 2,040 operating hours (102,000 MWh) yields
approximately 4.12%.

908 MoM, 9571.

9 See RD 661/2007 (C-0064/R-0101), Article 2(1)(b), sub-group b.1.2 [as per the Claimant’s translation; the
Respondent’s translation is identical in substance]. MO IET/1882/2014 (C-0403), Articles 3(2)(a), 4(1) speaks of
“[t]echnically indispensable uses”.

910 See RjoM, 781.

°1'To the contrary, according to Brattle’s Memorandum of 22 September 2020, fn. 27, the CSP Plants used only about
6,000 thermal MWh of Back-up Fuel in 2015 “for internal heating and other minor purposes”, which the Tribunal
understands to be the “[t]echnically indispensable uses” referred to in MO IET/1882/2014 (C-0403), Articles 3(2)(a),
4(1). 6,000 thermal MWh is roughly 40% of the maximum energy production through Back-up Fuel qualifying for
feed-in remuneration under RF3. It respresents approximately 1.6 respectively 1.7% of each CSP Plant’s overall
energy consumption in that year.

912 See RjoM, $781, 786. As per RWS-CMR2, {{154, when the cap was initialy set at 12/15%, there was still very
limited experience as to how much Back-up Fuel was necessary for technical purposes, given that there was only one
CSP plant in operation in Spain at the time, without production records being available.

may also explain why the Claimant’s partner in the CSP Plants, Aprovechamientos
Energéticos S.L., opined that this particular change of the regulatory framework

involved mere progressive adjustments and adaptations of the same remunerative regime to the
reality of the sector.”

(f) — Substitution of Index For Inflation Updates to Remuneration Values

RF1 had provided that the main remuneration values were to be updated quarterly as a
function of the CPI.?'4 RF3 substituted the CPI with a different index, the “Consumer Price
Index at a constant tax rate”, which excluded unprocessed foods and energy products.
While the Respondent claims that this did not harm producers because the new index was
higher than the CPI “in certain periods in 2013, 2014 and 2015°°'5, the Claimant asserts
that the new index was used only for 7 months in 2013 (until RD 661/2007 was repealed),
during which period it was much lower than the CPI (0.47% compared to 3.48%).°!°
Although the Claimant did not proffer any evidence for this specific assertion, the
Respondent did not dispute it, either.

That said, the Tribunal does not find the Claimant’s assertion conclusive in terms of
evidencing any harm to investors. First, the updates were to be made quarterly, meaning
that the important question is how the new index compared to the CPI at the precise points
in time when the update was due. The Claimant has not made any submissions in this
regard. Accordingly, the Tribunal is not prepared to accept that the substitution of the CPI
with another entailed any adverse effect on investors. Secondly, even if at the relevant
points in time the difference between the two indices was in fact approximately
3 percentage points, this would still only have quite a limited impact on the investment,
given the short period during which this change applied. Thirdly, the Tribunal does not
find it established, based on the record, that the new index was, by its nature, less
appropriate to be used as a benchmark for inflation updates than the CPI.*!”

(g) Periodic Review

RF1 foresaw quadrennial reviews of the main remuneration values, with new values
however not applying to facilities coming into operation before 1 January of the second
year following the relevant review.?!* RF3 subjects all remuneration parameters except for
the Regulatory Lifespan and the value of the investment, but including the RF3 Target IRR,
to a revision every three or six years (depending on the parameter). Existing facilities are
not exempted from any such revision. In fact, if the RF3 Target IRR is changed, past

payments already received by a producer under RF3 would be taken into account to
determine the payments yet to be made.°!”

The Tribunal finds that, conceptually, this is not an insignificant change, in particular with
respect to installations that were already operating before the revision takes place. That
said, it is not the review mechanism as such that would affect the remuneration payable to
the installations, but rather any subsequent action of the Respondent that makes use of the
mechanism, in which case it would be open to the Claimant to challenge such subsequent
action.°”° The review mechanism as such may, of course, be seen as an element increasing
the general regulatory risk, and thus making the financing of investments more difficult or
costly.?7! However, based on the record, the Tribunal is not convinced that had the
Respondent enacted RF3 without this particular change on the review mechanism, this
would significantly change the overall risk assessment of investors and financial
institutions. In particular, even if such review mechanism had not been introduced,
previous reforms as well as the enactment of RF3 itself would have made diligent investors
and banks aware that the Respondent might anyway reduce the applicable remuneration
through repealing the regulatory framework as such rather than using a review mechanism
provided for in the existing regulatory framework.

(h) Other Changes

While there were other changes to the feed-in regime, the Tribunal does not find it
established that any of them had any adverse effect on the CSP Plants or Wind Farms.

First, as regards the introduction of the Operating Threshold”? and Minimum Operating
Hours’, below which a facility would receive no or only reduced feed-in remuneration,”
the Tribunal notes that all of the Claimant’s facilities easily surpassed both of these
thresholds in the past, and can be assumed to continue to do so for the remainder of their
lifetime, based on any of the production forecasts.’?> Accordingly, the Tribunal does not
find it established that this change had any practical effect on the Claimant’s facilities.

Secondly, while the Claimant asserts that RF3 entailed a restriction of priority
access/despatch to the grid, as had been guaranteed by RFI, this was disputed by the
Respondent and the Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant met its burden of proof

919 See MoM, {1807ff.

°20'The Tribunal is aware that RDL 17/2019 (C-0855), Sole Article (1) represents such subsequent action as it provides
for a reduction of the RF3 Target IRR to 7.09% for the six-year regulatory period beginning on | January 2020 (subject
to the exception provided for in Third Final Provision Bis (1)). However, the Claimant has not challenged this piece
of legislation in this arbitration and has instead submitted that “[iJn this arbitration, it is not necessary to recalculate
damages because the valuation date is June 2014, see CC on ECT Decisions, (48.

°21 To this effect MoM, 811.

°22 MO IET/1045/2014 set these values to 714 annual operating hours for the CSP Plants and 629 for the Wind Farms,
see MoM, 4848.

°23 MO IET/1045/2014 set these values to 1,224 annual operating hours for the CSP Plants and 1,048 for the Wind
Farms, see MoM, 848.

°4 See RD 413/2014 (C-0399/R-01 10), Article 21(4)(b) and (c).

772

in this regard. Indeed, to the Tribunal, both Article 26(2) Law 24/2013°”6 and Article 6(2)
RD 413/2014°”’ still provide for priority access/despatch, and the Tribunal finds no
indication in the record that the Respondent has failed to respect this priority in practice.

Thirdly, even though it is undisputed that RF3 eliminated the supplement for reactive
energy (while keeping the related penalty),”* it has remained unclear what the magnitude
of this change or its impact on producers is. In fact, it has remained unclear whether the
Claimant’s facilities would have qualified at all to receive the supplement, had it continued
to exist. On this basis, the Tribunal is not in a position to consider the elimination of the
supplement a material change of the legislation.

Fourthly, the Claimant referred to a new obligation introduced by RF3 for producers to
finance a Tariff Deficit of up to 2%. However, the Tribunal notes that producers are entitled
to recover such contribution with interest.?2? Taking this into account, it has remained
unclear which adverse impact, if any, this particular change has on the Claimant.

Consequently, the Tribunal finds that none of these four changes can be considered to
constitute a material change to RF1 that adversely affected the Claimant.

(i) Conclusion

Based on the above analysis, the Tribunal concludes that the Disputed Measures brought
about two fundamental changes to RF1 that the Claimant established were detrimental to
its investment. First, the Respondent materially changed its understanding of which IRR
was reasonable. Secondly, the Respondent switched the remunerative paradigm by
transforming a system in which investors were incentivized to maximize production to a
system in which the production level was much less important.

By contrast, the Tribunal finds that the other changes, while numerous, were much less
significant in nature (or are consumed by the two before-mentioned changes) and that the
Claimant did not succeed in establishing that, in reality, any of them had any adverse effect
on the CSP Plants or Wind Farms.

(2) Economic Impact on the Claimant's Facilities

In assessing whether the Disputed Measures were a radical departure from RFI that
violated the Claimant’s legitimate expectation of Relative Stability, the Tribunal finds it
crucial to ascertain the economic impact that the Disputed Measures had on the Claimant’s
facilities. Inevitably, this analysis creates a certain overlap between responsibility and

quantum. However, in line with findings of other tribunals faced with similar claims against
the Respondent, the Tribunal does not find this overlap to be problematic.”*°

778 That said, before analysing the economic impact of the Disputed Measures, the Tribunal
will first explain the assumptions underlying its economic analysis, given that the Parties’
own assumptions differed significantly from each other in numerous respects.

(a) Assumptions Underlying the Economic Analysis
(i) Valuation Method

779 The Parties disagree on the methodology by which the economic impact of the Disputed
Measures should be determined.

780 The Claimant submits that one should apply the discounted cash-flow (“DCF”)
methodology. The Claimant asserts that this is the standard approach in financial valuation
used in the normal course not only by the Claimant before undertaking its investment, but
also by sponsors, accountants, lenders and even the Respondent itself.°>! In addition, the
Claimant alleges that the DCF method has come to dominate specifically the analyses of
investments in power stations. Finally, the Claimant submits that the historic
performance of the Claimant’s facilities represents a sufficient basis for the required
forecast of cash-flows.°*

781 The Respondent, in turn, argues that an asset-based valuation (“ABV”) is preferable in the
present case. The Respondent alleges that based on arbitral jurisprudence, an ABV is more
appropriate than a DCF calculation when the history of operations for the facility in
question is too short to allow for a projection of future earning, as is the case for the Wind
Farms and CSP Plants.”** Conversely, the Respondent claims that performing a DCF
calculation in this case is subjective and speculative, thus allowing for windfall profits.°*>
In particular, the Respondent argues that a DCF approach assumes a petrification of
remuneration values over many years, which the Respondent deems inappropriate and
incompatible with a regulated market, in line with jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme

930 See RREEF v. Spain II, 472; PV Investors v. Spain II, {647£. Even less so because, as will become clear in the
section on quantum, the damages that the Claimant is entitled to are not identical to the economic difference between
RFI and RF3.

Court.**° Also, the Respondent claims that the CSP Plants are among the pioneers for the
technology used on a non-experimental scale, and that the Wind Farms’ technology was
likewise immature when they were built in 2003, creating a high technological risk that
makes it very difficult to project the expenses for operation and maintenance of the
facilities.°°”

782 Inline with the approach taken by many other tribunals in respect of similar claims against
the Respondent,”** the Tribunal considers that the DCF method is more appropriate to
assess the economic impact that the Disputed Measures had on the Claimant compared to
the situation under RF1. The Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s argument that this is the
standard methodology used not only prior to making investments, but also to quantify
damages resulting from a breach of international law,”*? and the Tribunal does not share
the Respondent’s view that the present case should form an exception.

783 In particular, the Tribunal finds this suggestion by the Respondent difficult to reconcile
with the fact that the DCF method or at least forecasts of cash-flows were used by the
Respondent itself in the context of RF1.™° This implies that at the time of the investment,
the Respondent did not consider this approach inappropriate to determine the economic
effect of the feed-in regime.

784 Moreover, the Tribunal finds Brattle’s explanation convincing according to which power
stations “have a relatively simple business, producing electricity, whose demand and long-
run value can be analyzed and modeled in detail based on readily available data’, and that
their costs and production levels are relatively easy to predict.”*!

785 As to the predictability of production levels, the Tribunal finds this particularly plausible
given the priority of access/dispatch to the grid, which makes it very unlikely that a falling
electricity demand would have any impact on the production levels of the CSP Plants or
Wind Farms, thus making their revenue less vulnerable to market fluctuations than that of
other businesses. While the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the operating history
of the CSP Plants is relatively short as at the valuation date (21 June 2014, see section (ii)
infra), the Tribunal does not find this to be a sufficient reason to discard the DCF method
in relation to the CSP Plants. First, the Tribunal accepts Brattle’s submission that even

without any operating history, the production level of CSP Plants can still be forecast
relatively well based on technical design parameters.” If this were different, the Tribunal
would find it difficult to explain why banks were willing to lend very significant amounts
of money based on project finance arrangements that inherently depend on the
predictability of cash-flows. Also, the Respondent has not disputed that the EPC contracts
for the CSP Plants guaranteed a certain level of production™* and it seems unlikely that
such guarantee would be given if production levels were as difficult to predict as the
Respondent asserts. Secondly, as will become clear below, the Tribunal has opted for a
rather conservative forecast to the production level of CSP Plants so as to address the
concern arising from the limited track record of those facilities.

Regarding the Claimant’s argument that the DCF method assumes a freezing of the feed-
in remuneration over long periods of time, the Tribunal considers that the discounting of
future cash-flows and the taking into account of regulatory risk sufficiently reflect that
there is a level of uncertainty about future remuneration levels, which increases over time.

Furthermore, the Tribunal is not convinced that the DCF method is improper due to the
allegedly immature (at the time) technologies used by the Wind Farms and CSP Plants.
Even if the technologies had been immature and even if this resulted in predictions of O&M
costs being difficult, this does not undermine the present DCF analysis because the
Tribunal has modelled these costs not according to any hypothetical assumptions but rather
according to the actual costs contractually agreed to be paid by the CSP SPVs and Wind
SPVs in the future to their respective operators (see [836 infra).

Finally, while the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that there is of course a certain level
of subjectivity and speculation inherent to any DCF calculation, the Tribunal notes that the
ABV proposed by the Respondent is likewise based on numerous assumptions that are, to
some extent, necessarily subjective and speculative.** In fact, the same is likely to be true
for any valuation method.** Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that the existence of
elements of subjectivity and speculation do not discredit the DCF method as such, but
rather call for a very careful approach to the underlying assumptions in order to minimize
the risk of what the Respondent calls a “Cinderella effect”.°*° Indeed, as will become clear
in the next sections, the Tribunal has taken quite a conservative approach in this regard,
addressing in many cases the criticism raised by the Respondent in respect of the
assumptions underlying the Claimant’s DCF model.

(ii) Valuation Date

789 The Claimant submits that the valuation date should be 21 June 2014, which is the date on
which MO IET/1045/2014 came into force, setting for the first time the specific
remuneration values applicable under RF3.*4” The Respondent argues that the valuation
date should be 28 February 2012 for the Wind Farms** and 31 December 2012 for the
CSP Plants,’ each being the day before the first Disputed Measure affecting the respective
technology came into force (Regional Act 1/2012 and Law 15/2012, respectively).

790 The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the appropriate valuation date is 21 June 2014.
Only on that date it became clear what the remuneration under RF3 was. If one chose earlier
valuation dates such as those proposed by the Respondent, one would either need to
ascertain what remuneration, based on the information available on those dates, could be
expected to be offered by RF3 once it was completed (which would be unnecessarily
speculative), or one would need to use the benefit of hindsight (which is generally
inconsistent with applying the DCF approach as of the valuation date). The Tribunal finds
additional comfort in the fact that most other tribunals faced with comparable claims
against the Respondent likewise chose a valuation date in June 2014.°°

(iii) Inflation

791 — It is the Claimant’s view that inflation should be forecast by reference to the traded prices
of Spanish inflation swaps.”°! By contrast, the Respondent appears to assume 2% inflation
in the but-for scenario and 1.5% inflation in the actual scenario.?

792 The Tribunal finds the Claimant’s approach reasonable. By contrast, the Respondent has
failed to explain how it calculated its inflation rates, and why they should be different in
the two scenarios. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that inflation shall be forecast by reference
to trades prices of Spanish inflation swaps. The Experts agree that this yields an inflation
rate of approximately 2.27%.°?

regulatory service life of the CSP Plants”, this is difficult to reconcile with the fact that Morén entered into operation
on 25 October 2012 and Olivenza on | February 2013.

(iv) Feed-in Remuneration in the Actual Scenario

In view of RD 413/2014 contemplating an update of remuneration values in 2019 and every
three years thereafter, the Claimant’s own economic model assumes that the Respondent
will continue to apply a spread of 3 percentage points above the Spanish 10-year bond
yield, and forecasts the likely evolution of that bond yield based on June 2014 bond market
conditions and according to the Spanish “yield curve” as indicated by bonds with different
maturities.*** The Respondent’s own economic model, in turn, apparently assumes that the
RF3 Target IRR will remain the same and that the bond yield will be unchanged from
2017 onwards.°°°

In the Tribunal’s view, on the valuation date, there was no sufficiently reliable indication
as to how the Respondent may adjust the spread in the periodical reviews foreseen by RF3.
Likewise, the Tribunal is not fully convinced by the bond yield forecast suggested by the
Claimant. Instead, the Tribunal considers it preferable to assume that RInv and ROp will
remain the same as on the valuation date for the entire lifetime of the Claimant’s facilities.
However, as agreed by both Experts, it seems appropriate to index ROp (but not RInv) to
inflation?”

That said, the Experts disagree on the applicable inflation rate. Brattle argues that an
inflation rate of 1% should apply because this is the rate actually used by the Respondent
to forecast operating costs of the standard plants in June 2014, which in turn was the basis
on which Spain set the ROp that applied on the valuation date.°°* By contrast, Accuracy
submits that there is no reason not to apply the general inflation rate forecast of 2.27% to
the ROp.

The Tribunal finds Accuracy’s position more convincing. Brattle’s proposal ignores the
periodic review mechanism provided for in RF3. Because of this mechanism, it was clear
from the beginning that whatever inflation rate the Respondent may have used in June 2014
to forecast the operating costs in order to derive the ROp, this did not mean that the same
inflation rate would be used throughout the following revisions. Indeed, Brattle itself
acknowledged that Spain has in fact “used the three-year updates to adjust for the
difference between Spain’s forecasts of pool prices and_inflation, and the outturn”
(emphasis added).**? While this is hindsight knowledge, it merely confirms what was to be
expected in any case: the Respondent’s initial assumption in June 2014, namely 1%
inflation on the operating costs, was not cast in stone for the remainder of the lifetime of
the Wind Farms and CSP Plants, but would rather be revised triennially in view of actual
inflation rates.

797 In addition, the Tribunal recalls that the ROp is meant to cover the shortfall between
expected revenues from electricity sales to the pool and forecast annual operating costs of
the relevant standard facility. Given this objective, the Tribunal had indicated to the Experts
subsequent to Procedural Order No. 14 that “an appropriate approach may be to forecast
the [ROp] in a way that ensures that the formula (pool price + [ROp]) - operating costs
constantly yields the same result from the valuation date onwards” The Tribunal
maintains this view and considers that only Accuracy’s position on the inflation rate is
commensurate with the said approach, given that the in the Tribunal’s economic model,
the pool price is likewise subject to the general inflation rate of 2.27%.°°!

(v)  Feed-in Remuneration in the But-for Scenario

798 As to the feed-in remuneration payable in the but-for scenario, the Claimant’s own model
assumes that RF1 continues to apply,” with at least the CSP Plants opting for Pool Price
Plus Premium; it is not quite clear to the Tribunal whether the same is assumed for Wind
Farms®® or whether they are assumed to opt for the Regulated Tariff?*. Moreover, the
Claimant assumes that the premiums will remain at 2013 levels, indexed for inflation
thereafter.°°

799 While the Respondent’s primary position is that RF1 did not guarantee any specific
remuneration but rather was subject to the principle of a dynamic reasonable return, the
Respondent does, in its subsidiary damage calculation, assume that RF1 would have
applied, at least for the CSP Plants.” However, contrary to the Claimant, the Respondent
applies the Regulated Tariff as used in the financial models, updated each year based on
the CPI.” For the Wind Farms, it seems that based on an EU law argument, the
Respondent is assuming payment of subsidies only up to the point of the investment having
been recovered, which it claims was almost the case in June 2014.°%

800 Asa matter of principle, in the framework of the present analysis, which seeks to determine
the economic impact of the Disputed Measures, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that
the CSP Plants’ and Wind Farms’ performance under RF3 is to be compared with RF1 as
it existed, rather than ‘correcting’ it based on EU law. This holds true in particular as the

 

960 E-Mail to the Parties of 14 July 2020.

961 Brattle’s Memorandum of 5 August 2020, {28, disagrees with this assessment, but it does so by mixing the
operating costs of standard installations (which are indexed at 2.27%) with those of the actual plants (which are
indexed according to what is agreed in the O&M contracts, as per Procedural Order No. 14). The formula mentioned
by the Tribunal as part of its preliminary view relates to standard installations because the ROp was meant to cover a
standard installation’s (not: the actual installation’s) shortfall between pool prices and operating costs.

their past profitability rate, see BQR II, {{{[]163-166.

Tribunal is not in a position to judge whether, and to what extent, subsidies under RF1
exceeded the amount that was still acceptable under EU law.

That said, contrary to the Claimant’s position (at least on the CSP Plants), the Tribunal
prefers to rely in its analysis on the Regulated Tariff. While the Tribunal acknowledges
that the Wind Farms had always operated under the Pool Price Plus Premium Option and
that the CSP Plants were likely to make the same choice before that option was eliminated,
the Tribunal notes that the dependency of the overall remuneration on the evolvement of
the pool price makes this option more difficult to predict, rendering a DCF calculation on
that basis more speculative. This impression seems confirmed by the fact that by using the
Pool Price Plus Premium option, the Claimant’s own economic model seems to have
benefitted the CSP Plants by EUR 11 million as compared to the Regulated Tariff.° As
the Pool Price Plus Premium Option was meant to yield the same IRR as the Regulated
Tariff,?”° the Tribunal finds it likely that the Respondent would have adjusted the premiums
so as to largely synchronize the two tariff options over time.°”! This makes the Tribunal
doubt the appropriateness of forecasting remuneration that is significantly above the
Regulated Tariff.

In addition, the Tribunal notes that the bank case at the time of the investment was based
on the Regulated Tariff. While the Tribunal appreciates that the bank case may be more
conservative than the investor’s own expectations, this is in line with the Tribunal’s
preference for a rather conservative approach to the DCF analysis.°””

(vi) Pool Prices

The pool price underlying the Claimant’s economic model is EUR 48/MWh in 2015/16
(consistent with Bloomberg’s forward prices in June 2014 for deliveries in 2015 and 2016),
with annual increases thereafter in line with forecasted inflation.°”* For the CSP Plants, the
Claimant added a premium of 2.07 (as per MO IET/1045/2014) in the actual scenario
because they produce electricity during the day when pool prices tend to be highest.?”* For
the Wind Farms, a discount of 11.11% is applied (as per MO IET/1045/2014) in the actual
scenario because they do not tend to produce at peak periods.

The Respondent’s economic analysis, by contrast, relies on the pool prices given by
MO IET/1045/2014 for the period from 2014 to 2017, and applies EUR 53.08/MWh from
2017 onwards.°”>

As the market prices indicated in MO IET/1045/2014 were merely assumptions made by
the Respondent when it adopted that MO, the Tribunal prefers to begin with the actual price
on the valuation date and use that price for the remainder of 2014. For 2015 and 2016, the
Tribunal finds the Claimant’s approach convincing, i.e. to use the forward prices for these
two years as at the valuation date (EUR 48/MWh). Thereafter, this price shall be indexed
for inflation, at the general inflation rate mentioned above. Moreover, in the actual
scenario, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that it is appropriate to apply a premium
of 2.07% to the CSP Plants and a discount of 11.11% to the Wind Farms, in accordance
with MO IET/1024/2014.

(vii) Projected Lifetime of the Claimant's Facilities

According to the Claimant, both the CSP Plants””° and the Wind Farms””” can be expected
to operate for 35 years. Regarding the CSP Plants, the Claimant argues, in particular, that
the reasonableness of such lifetime expectancy is confirmed by the track record of similar
plants, statements by public and scientific organisations, as well as the ATA Wind Lifetime
Report. The Claimant asserts that the (shorter) lifetime indicated in the CSP SPV’s
financial statements is irrelevant because these statements are concerned with depreciation
life rather than actual useful life.?”8 In relation to the Wind Farms, while the Claimant
acknowledges that extending their lifetime beyond 25 years requires some action (constant
recondition of components, replacement of minor components), the Claimant contends that
the investment involved is minor.?”? Moreover, the Claimant argues that RD 661/2007
itself acknowledged lifetimes of more than 25 years by providing for payment of feed-in
remuneration thereafter.

By contrast, the Respondent asserts that the CSP Plants’ lifetime expectancy is 25 years”*”
while the Wind Farms’ is 20 years.°*! As to the CSP Plants, the Respondent points out that
the CSP SPV’s financial statements assumed 25 years in 2013/14 (in earlier years, it was
20 or 30 years)? and that the bank model contemplated 21 years.*** Moreover, the
Respondent refers to the Servert Report, which concludes that the expected lifetime of the
CSP Plants is 20-25 years, in the best case.°** With respect to the Wind Farms, the
Respondent invokes the Wind SPV’s financial statements, which assumed 12.5 years
between 2007 and 2011, in line with the bank case.°** The Respondent notes that this was
changed to 20 years as of the 2013 financial statements, which the Respondent asserts is
consistent with MO IET/1045/2014, the PER 2005 and the technical study underlying the
2011-2020 Renewable Energy Plan. The Respondent also refers to statements by the

European Wind Energy Association and the publication “Renewables First”, both of which
indicate a useful lifetime of 20-25 years.°*°

808 As regards the CSP Plants, the Tribunal finds that 25 years, as contended by the
Respondent, is a realistic lifetime expectancy, in particular in view of the Tribunal’s
conviction that a conservative approach to the DCF analysis is appropriate.**” The Parties’
respective technical experts, Mr. Mesa-Diaz of ATA and Dr. Servert, agreed that CSP
plants in Spain are designed for a useful life of 25 years.°** Equally, they agreed that some
of the main components of the CSP Plants were designed for a lifetime of 20-25 years.**
While both technical experts likewise agreed that depending on the circumstances it can be
possible to operate CSP plants beyond the useful life for which they were designed, the
Tribunal does not find it established that in the case of the CSP Plants, this is to be expected
with a sufficient degree of certainty.

809 First, both Parties’ technical experts agree that the design, equipment, quality of
construction and the operation and maintenance practice are crucial factors in assessing the
expected lifetime of a CSP Plant.°” Surprisingly, however, the experts confirmed at the
Hearing that neither of them had even been provided with the annex to the EPC contract
that would have allowed them to study the design of the CSP Plants in detail.°”! Similarly,
it appears that there are concerns or at least uncertainties regarding the quality of the
construction as well as operation and maintenance of the CSP Plants.°?? Moreover,
Mr. Mesa-Diaz acknowledged at the hearing that the equipment for which he assessed the
useful life was not the equipment used specifically at the CSP Plants, but rather equipment
used in CSP plants in general in Spain,””? whereas Dr. Servert confirmed that the analysis
conducted in the Servert Report was based on the components of the CSP Plants.?”* On the
basis of the foregoing alone, the Tribunal does not hesitate to find that the Claimant has
failed to establish that the CSP Plants can be expected to operate for more than 25 years.”

810 Secondly, for multiple reasons, the Tribunal is not convinced that the example of the SEGS
plants in California would show that the CSP Plants can be expected to operate for more
than 25 years. To begin with, the Claimant has not established that the SEGS plants are
sufficiently comparable to the CSP Plants in terms of design, equipment, quality of
construction and the operation and maintenance practice. In fact, as mentioned above, the
technical experts were not even able to ascertain with certainty all relevant aspects of the

design, construction and operation and maintenance of the CSP Plants themselves. In
addition, the Tribunal considers it established based on the Servert Report that
significant”® additional investments were required between years 17-23 of operation in
order to enable the SEGS plants to continue operating after year 25.” In view of the above,
the Tribunal is not prepared to conclude from the experience with the SEGS plants that the
CSP Plants can be expected to operate for more than 25 years.

811 Thirdly, to the extent that the Claimant seeks to rely on the example of another CSP plant,
the DEWA project in Dubai, it seems that, unlike the CSP plants in Spain, the DEWA
project was in fact designed to last for 35 years, which however entails higher capital
expenditures than those made for the CSP Plants.°°* For this reason alone, the Tribunal
does not consider it established that the DEWA project is comparable to the CSP Plants.
In any case, as the DEWA project was completed only in 2018,” nobody knows at this
time whether it will in fact reach more than 25 years of operational life.

812 Fourthly, even if the Tribunal were prepared to accept that, in principle, additional
investments in the CSP Plants would allow them to operate for more than 25 years, it would
have been for the Claimant to establish the magnitude of such investment so that the
Tribunal could assess the likelihood of such investment being made (and, if it could be
expected to be made, take such investment into account in assessing the future cash-flows
of the CSP Plants). The Tribunal considers that the Claimant has failed to do so. While, at
the Hearing, Mr. Mesa-Diaz provided an estimate of the requirement additional investment
(25% of the intial investment),!°°° the ATA CSP Lifetime Report does not provide any
numbers or sources that would have allowed the Tribunal to assess the accuracy of that
estimate. In addition, the estimate was disputed by Dr. Servert at the hearing (who
estimated 75-80% of the initial investment).

813 Fifthly, the Tribunal finds that the studies referred to in the ATA CSP Lifetime Report
equally do not allow for the conclusion that the CSP Plants will operate for more than 25
years. To begin with, the Tribunal notes that the ranges of forecasted lifetimes indicated in
three of the seven studies actually include a lifetime of 25 years.'°? Therefore, those three
studies do not call into question the Respondent’s assertion that the CSP Plants have a
liftetime of no more than 25 years. In addition, the Tribunal shares Dr. Servert’s concerns
as to the informative value of those studies in relation to the CSP Plants.!0 In particular,
the factual basis of the lifetime estimates made in those studies seems rather opaque, taking

°%6 While the technical experts disagreed on the extent of the additional investments made at the SEGS plants to
prolong their useful life, they did agree that the investment was at least USD 100 million, see HT, Day 3, 192:25-

into account also that at the time those studies were issued, the only real experience with
CSP projects was the SEGS project.

On balance, therefore, the Tribunal does not find it established that the CSP Plants can be
expected to operate for more than 25 years. Contrary to the Claimant’s view, the Tribunal
does not consider this finding to be contradicted by the fact that RD 661/2007 provided for
feed-in remuneration also after 25 years of operation. This merely implies that RD
661/2007 saw the possibility of renewable energy projects operating for more than 25
years, which is a different question than whether the CSP Plants in particular can be
expected to operate for more than 25 years. The Tribunal also notes that its finding on the
lifetime of the CSP Plants is in line with other tribunals’ findings on CSP plants in
Spain.!04

 

With respect to the Wind Farms, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent did not submit any
expert report. At the same time, however, the Tribunal considers that the ATA Wind
Lifetime Report does not engage in any technical analysis of the Wind Farms
specifically.!°°> Instead, it contains general statements on what is technically possible and
what life expectancy some other wind farms have.'”° Indeed, the only specific documents
in relation to the Wind Farms analysed in the ATA Wind Lifetime Report are the O&M
contracts,'°°’ based on which it was assumed that the Wind Farms “underwent and will
continue to undergo adequate and standard maintenance during their lifetime”'°’ and that
“life extension plans are a suitable option”!© for the Wind Farms. Notably, the specific
construction contracts were not taken into account, as acknowledged by Mr. Fernandez.
Garcia at the Hearing. However, he also stated that he was aware of the general design
because the Wind Farms were built by the manufacturer itself, who were “using obviously
the design strictures of their own equipment”.'°'° Moreover, Mr. Fernandez Garcia testified
at the hearing that there are wind farms in Spain that have been operating for 25-28 years
even though they are using older technology than the Wind Farms.!°!!

The Tribunal further notes that the ATA Wind Lifetime Report acknowledges that without
life extension programs, most wind farms have a life expectancy of 20-30 years.'°!? While
ATA claimed that the costs of such programs are “relatively low” compared to the initial
investment,!°'? no specific numbers were provided.'°'4 Accordingly, the Tribunal is not in

a position to assess the likelihood of such investment being made — or to take such
investment into account as additional costs in a forecast of cash-flows, if the Tribunal were
prepared to assume a life expectancy exceeding 25 years. Therefore, the Tribunal prefers
not to take the possibility of life extension programs into account.

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to assume a lifetime of 25 years.
This reflects, in particular, the undisputed fact that wind farms with older technology have
been operating in Spain for 25-28 years and that studies indicate a general life-time
expectancy of wind farms of 20-30 years (without extension programs). Moreover, the
Tribunal notes that a life expectancy of 25 years is in line with the findings of other
tribunals on wind farms in Spain.!°!5

(viii) Production Levels

The Claimant based its economic model on “historical performance and contemporaneous
forecasts prepared by Renergy”.'°!® Specifically, in relation to the Wind Farms, the
Claimant’s annual forecast for 2015 onwards is approximately 64.9 GWh for Hedroso, 77.3
GWh for Padornelo and 107.5 GWh for Lubidn.!°'? For the CSP Plants, the
contemporaneous forecast anticipates annual production of approximately 133.1 GWh per
year for Olivenza and 134.6 GWh per year for Morén.'°!® However, as those forecasts
would cause the CSP Plants to exceed the Maximum Operating Hours under RF3 (2,040
hours = 102GWh for a SOMW plant), the Claimant appears to assume in the actual scenario
that the CSP Plants will produce 102 GWh annually, seemingly with a slight degradation
each year.!0!9

The basis of the Respondent’s forecast differs depending on the scenario. In the but-for
scenario, the Respondent relies on the bank models, at least as far as the CSP Plants are
concerned. This means 117GWh per year for Morén and 115.4GWh per year for Olivenza,
but degrading 0.1% per year starting from year 11 of regulatory service life.!°?° While the
Respondent’s position is not as clear with respect to the Wind Farms, the Respondent
likewise seems to have used the bank models for the but-for scenario (which are higher
than the Claimant’s forecast).!°?! In the actual scenario, the Respondent assumes
production based on the reference production of a standard installation as per as per Annex
Ill of IET/1045/2014 MO, which includes annual degradation from 2014 onwards of 0.2%
for the CSP Plants and 0.5% for the Wind Farms. !°

For the Wind Farms, given that on the valuation date they had already been in operation
for up to ten years,'°”* the Tribunal finds that, in principle, the most objective approach is
to use the average historical annual production from before the valuation date as a forecast
for future years.'°* However, for Hedroso and Lubin, this approach would yield lower
production levels than either of the Parties’ own forecasts for the actual scenario (which
are also very similar to each other).!° The Tribunal does not find it appropriate to
substitute its own forecast for the Parties’ forecasts to the extent that both of them are
aligned. Therefore, in relation to Hedroso and Lubian, the present analysis uses the average
between the actual scenario forecasts submitted by the Parties. For consistency, the
Tribunal will use the same approach also for Padornelo, despite the fact that in that case,
the historic average was slightly above the Respondent’s forecast.

The Tribunal further finds that its above-described forecast for the Wind Farms shall apply
not only in the actual scenario but also in the but-for scenario. Contrary to the Respondent’s
approach, the Tribunal fails to see why the Wind Farms’ production should differ from one
scenario to the other.

As to the CSP Plants, given their shorter history of operations, the Tribunal considers that
the most appropriate approach is to rely on contemporaneous forecasts around the valuation
date. Two types of forecasts exist: the Claimant’s own forecasts!°”° and the bank case.
These forecasts differ significantly from each other and it is difficult for the Tribunal to tell
which of the two is more realistic. While the Tribunal accepts that the bank case may have
erred on the lower side in order to ensure that cash-flows are sufficient to service the debt,
the Tribunal considers that the Claimant’s own forecasts may have been too optimistic. In
particular, the Tribunal notes that in 2013 and 2014, actual solar production!?7 at Olivenza
was 20% respectively 19% below the Claimant’s long-run production expectations, and
actual solar production at Morén fell 21% respectively 8% short of those expectations. !°7
While Brattle suggests that “[mJ]etereological conditions may explain some of the
varation,'? it is unclear which portion of the variation this concers and what the reasons
were behind the remainder of the variation. In addition, the Claimants have not established
that in future years the relevant metereological conditions can be expected to be
significantly better than in 2013 and 2014. On balance, therefore, the Tribunal finds it
appropriate to use the average of the Claimant’s contemporaneous forecasts and the bank
case.

In principle, this applies to both the but-for scenario and the actual scenario. However, in
the actual scenario, the forecast needs to reflect that RF3 introduced a new rule on the use

023 Hedroso, Padornelo and Lubin started operating in 2004, see BQR-105 and also RWS-CMR2, {130 (Table 14).

of Back-up Fuel. While the Claimant’s forecast from 2015 does take this into account, the
only bank case available contemplates that the CSP Plants would produce 12% of their
overall energy through the burning of Back-up Fuel, i.e. the absolute maximum allowed
under RFI in the Regulated Tariff option. This assumption underlying the bank case is not
compatible with the actual scenario, in which RF3 provides for a much lower absolute limit
for the use of Back-up Fuel. In other words, as agreed by the Experts, the bank case needs
to be adjusted to fit the actual scenario, before an average can be built with the Claimant’s
contemporaneous forecast from 2015. However, the Experts disagree on what the
appropriate adjustment to the bank case is.

Brattle’s solution is to look into the Claimant’s own contemporaneous forecasts from 2011
(which assumed 15% production with Back-up Fuel) and 2015 (which assumes no use of
Back-up Fuel at all) to derive a ratio between production with and without Back-up Fuel.
This ratio is then applied to the bank case (after adjusting the ratio to 12% Back-up Fuel,
as is underlying the bank case). Accuracy, instead, simply deducts 12% from the bank case.

Brattle’s approach results in a lower overall production in the actual scenario (and, thus, a
greater economic impact of the Disputed Measures) than Accuracy’s approach. According
to Brattle, the reason behind this is that the Claimant’s contemporaneous forecasts
considered that burning Back-up Fuel not only generated energy directly, but also created
efficiencies that indirectly benefitted solar power production. In particular, as is undisputed
between the Parties, burning Back-up Fuel helps maintaining a certain temperature of the
heat transfer fluid during spells of low solar radiation, which in turn allows CSP plants to
instantly start producing solar energy at normal levels once there is again sufficient solar
radiation.'!° Due to these efficiencies, the comparison between the Claimant’s
contemporaneous forecasts from 2011 and 2015 implies that 15% Back-up Fuel use
translates into 22% additional energy production.'*!

As a matter of principle, Brattle’s position seems to make more sense because both Parties
agree that burning Back-up Fuel can increase the efficiency of solar energy production.
However, the problem is that neither the Claimant’s contemporaneous forecasts nor Brattle
provide any verifiable details as to (the magnitude of) such efficiencies.

As mentioned, on Brattle’s case, 15% Back-up Fuel use translates into 22% additional
energy production. This number seems quite high, at least without any further information
beyond the mere comparison between the production forecasts from 2011 and 2015. As the
Tribunal has the impression that the Claimant’s initial forecast from 2011 may have been
a bit too optimistic, the Tribunal is not convinced that the entire difference between the
2011 and 2015 forecasts is due to the reduction in Back-up Fuel use, as opposed to other
factors that may have been considered when the 2015 forecast was made. While it appears
likely that use of Back-up Fuel does have a positive effect on the solar production capacity,
it is not possible for the Tribunal to quantify this effect given that no relevant information
was provided beyond the Claimant’s own forecasts. As the Claimant bears the burden of

832

proving its damage, the Tribunal finds that this lack of information must go to the detriment
of the Claimant.

Therefore, the Tribunal assumes that in the actual scenario, the production will be the
average between the Claimant’s contemporaneous forecast from 2015 and 88% of the
production forecast from the bank case. As this average is below the Maximum Operation
Hours for both Olivenza and Morén,'°* no further adjustment is necessary.

(ix) Use of Back-up Fuel

In the Claimant’s economic model, the but-for scenario contemplates that 15% of the
respective CSP Plant’s total energy production is generated through the burning of Back-
up Fuel.!°*3 By contrast, in its actual scenario, the Claimant assumes that no Back-up Fuel
will be used at all for production of energy after December 2014, which the Claimant
asserts is consistent with the actual behaviour of the CSP Plants and with their actual
revised operating plans.!°**

The Respondent’s but-for scenario, in turn, is based on the use of Back-up Fuel
contemplated in the bank case, which the Tribunal takes to be 12% of the overall energy
production.'°** In the actual scenario, the Respondent assumes use of Back-up Fuel based
on what it claims are the Claimant’s own operating assumptions.!°°°

As mentioned above, the Tribunal is not convinced that RF1 granted producers an
unconditional right to feed-in remuneration for electricity generated through the burning
of Back-up Fuel, i.e. irrespective of whether the use of LNG was necessary for technical
purposes.'°>? Accordingly, on its own motion, the Tribunal would not have necessarily
assumed that the CSP Plants would burn the maximum amount of 12% (under the
Regulated Tariff) in the but-for scenario. However, as the Respondent itself took this
position and the Claimant assumed an even higher use of 15% (due to its assumption that
the Pool Price Plus Premium option applied), the Tribunal does not find it appropriate to
substitute its view for the Parties’ joint view that the LNG use is no less than 12% of the
total energy produced. Accordingly, the Tribunal assumes that in the but-for scenario, the
CSP Plants generate 12% of their overall energy production through the burning of LNG.

In respect of the actual scenario, the Tribunal finds that in order to be consistent, one should
also assume that the CSP Plants would burn the maximum amount of Back-up Fuel that
still qualifies for feed-in remuneration, namely 15,000 thermal MWh.

0% The averages are 101,201 MWh for Morén and 101,773 for Olivenza, see Accuracy’s Response of 21 September
2020, 22. This corresponds to 2,024.02 and 2,035.42 annual operating hours, respectively.

(x) Back-up Fuel Prices

The Claimant’s economic model forecasts Back-up Fuel prices to increase at the inflation
rate.!°8 Tt is not quite clear which assumption is underlying the Respondent’s model in this
regard. The Tribunal finds the Claimant’s approach reasonable and has therefore adopted
it for the present analysis.

(xi) O&M Costs

In the Claimant’s economic model, the costs for operating and maintaining the Claimant’s
facilities are projected by reference to their O&M contracts, not forecasting the payment
of any bonuses or penalties thereunder. '*? In the but-for-scenario, an increase is made to
reflect use of Back-up Fuel at the maximum allowed under RF1.!°

In the but-for scenario, the Respondent has taken essentially the same position for the CSP
Plants,'°! whereas its position on the Wind Farms is unclear. In the actual scenario, the
Respondent instead relies for the CSP Plants on data provided by Brattle!” while for the
Wind Farms it uses an estimate that is based on the historic average for 2009-2011, indexed
for inflation thereafter.!°

The Tribunal finds the Claimant’s position more reasonable as there is no indication on
record that the O&M contracts may be amended concerning payments to be made for
operating and maintaining the Claimant’s facilities. Also, the Tribunal agrees that in the
but-for scenario, an adjustment needs to be made to reflect the additional use of Back-up
Fuel.

(xii) Discount Rate (Not Including Regulatory Risk)

The Tribunal finds the Claimant’s view convincing that it is preferable to address
regulatory risk by adjusting cash-flows appropriately, instead of modifying the discount
rate.!4 The Respondent has likewise computed discount rates not reflecting regulatory
risk.'> Accordingly, regulatory risk will be dealt with separately in section (xiii) infra.

According to the Claimant, the discount rate should be 4.8%. The Claimant calculated this
rate based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (“CAPM”) and the following parameters:

(i) Risk-free rate: 2.09% (20-year Euribor swap rate on 21 June 2014)!#°

(ii) Beta: 0.5, based on how a sample of 17 renewables firms (14 from Europe) with
publicly traded stock performed in comparison to the FTSE All-Europe stock
index!”

(iii) Market risk premium: 5.5%, based on a study by the London Business School that
compared historical performance of stocks to short-term government bonds!™4*

The Respondent, in turn, calculated a discount rate of 4.0% for the CSP Plants, likewise
applying the CAPM methodology and using the following parameters:

(i) Risk-free rate: 2.16% (20-year Euribor swap rate on 31 December 2012, i.e. the
Respondent’s valuation date for the CSP Plants)!?

(ii) Beta: 0.41% (same methodology as the Claimant, but with a different selection of
20 listed companies in the renewables sector)!°°°

(iii) Market risk premium: 4.5%, based on a different figure from the same study as
invoked by the Claimant!®>!

For the Wind Farms, the Respondent calculated a discount rate of 4.3% based on the
following CAPM parameters:!°>?

(i) Risk-free rate: 2.6% (20-year Euribor swap rate on 28 February 2012, i.e. the
Respondent’s valuation date for the Wind Farms)

(ii) Beta: 0.37%!
(iii) Market risk premium: 4.5%, as for the CSP Plants

The Tribunal agrees with the Experts that it is appropriate to determine the discount rate
based on the CAPM methodology. As to the risk-free rate, the Experts agree on the
appropriate proxy, namely the 20-year Euribor swap rate, and merely disagree on the
valuation date. Given the Tribunal’s finding that the valuation date is 21 June 2014 and in
view of the fact that the Respondent has not disputed that on that date, the 20-year Euribor
swap rate was 2.09%, this is the risk-free rate that the Tribunal chooses to apply. Regarding
the beta, the Tribunal does not see itself in a position to determine whose Expert’s list of

risks, which the Claimant considers as part of its analysis of Spanish regulatory risk, outside the discount rate.

comparable companies is more appropriate. To the Tribunal, both of them appear equally
sustainable. Therefore, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to take the average between the
Expert’s betas.!°™4 As the Respondent has calculated a beta of 0.4% for the Tribunal’s
valuation date of 21 June 2014,'°> the average with the Claimant’s beta is 0.45%. Finally,
as to the market risk premium, the Tribunal finds 4.5% appropriate because the study on
market risk that both Experts rely on gives that number.!°° Applying the CAPM
formula,'°™’ this yields a discount rate of 4.115%.

(xiii) Regulatory Risk

842 The Claimant calculates regulatory risk based on the assumption that Spanish Tariff Deficit
securities have a rating of BBB+ in the actual scenario (consistent with Spanish
government bonds) and A+ in the but-for-scenario (consistent with rating agencies
allowing for an uplift of up to three notches above the relevant sovereign).!°** According
to the Claimant, these ratings translated (on 21 June 2014) into an annual chance of default
of 3.4% in the actual scenario and 2% in the but-for-scenario.'°? The recovery rate
assumed by the Claimant in its calculations is 60% in case of default.!° As a result, in the
Claimant’s model, if one translates regulatory risk into a premium to be added to the
discount rate, the regulatory risk premium in the actual scenario is 0.1 percentage points
for Hedroso, Padornelo and Lubian I, 0.5 percentage points for Lubidn II, and 1.6
percentage points for the CSP Plants. In the but-for scenario, the Claimant calculates a
regulatory risk premium of 0.5 percentage points for Lubian I and II, 0.6 percentage points
for Hedroso and Padornelo, and 1 percentage points for the CSP Plants.'*! In other words,
the Claimant’s position is that regulatory risk increased in the actual scenario by 0.6
percentage points for the CSP Plants, while for the Wind Farms it stayed the same (Lubian
II, being the newest) or decreased by 0.4/0.5 percentage points because they are older and
receive less remuneration under RF3 than newer installations (thus reducing risk
exposure). !06

843 By contrast, the Respondent asserts that as a result of the Disputed Measures, the regulatory
risk decreased for all of the Claimant’s facilities by 1.7 percentage points. In the
Respondent’s view, before the Disputed Measures were taken, rating agencies had
downgraded Tariff Deficit securities precisely because of the high deficit and the
uncertainty about the measures that Spain was going to take to address the situation. !°°
The Respondent notes that once the last Disputed Measures were adopted, the rating rose

again and one of the securities even regained by 2015 a three-notch difference as compared
to Spanish bonds.'° The Respondent assumes that the tariff deficit securities rating will
rise to AA in the actual scenario (noting that at the time this submission was made, the
rating was already between A and A+), while in the but-for scenario it would have further
deteriorated to at least BBB-.'°° Translating these assumptions into a premium to the
discount rate, the Respondent calculates a regulatory risk premium of 2.2 percentage points
in the but-for scenario and 0.5 percentage points in the actual scenario. !°%

844 The Tribunal finds this question of the appropriate regulatory risk premium particularly
difficult to answer.'°%’ On the one hand, the Tribunal notes that after constantly falling in
the years before the Disputed Measures were adopted, the rating of the Tariff Deficit
securities did in fact recover thereafter. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that this
seems to indicate a decrease in regulatory risk. On the other hand, the Tribunal finds that
there is some force to the Claimant’s argument that in the but-for scenario, one cannot
assume that the Respondent would not have taken any alternative measures in order to
decrease the Tariff Deficit, such as imposing higher access tolls and/or increasing energy
prices. In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to adopt the Claimant’s
assumptions for the actual scenario, but to use the same regulatory risk also in the but-for
scenario because the Parties’ position on how those ratings and yields would have evolved
but for the Disputes Measures appear equally persuasive (and speculative).

(xiv) Taxes

845 In respect of tax liabilities from before the valuation date, the Claimant has based them in
the actual scenario on the asset values actually reported for accounting purposes, while in
the but-for scenario they are based on the depreciation and amortization the SPVs would
have reported in the absence of the asset write-downs that occurred in 2013 in response to
the Disputed Measures.!° This position, which has not been contested by the Respondent,
seems reasonable to the Tribunal. Consequently, it is adopted for the present analysis.

846 In addition, the TEE and TVPEE shall apply not only in the actual scenario, but also in the
but-for scenario, given that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant’s claim as far
as these taxation measures are concerned. Eliminating those measures from the but-for
scenario would imply a finding that they breached the ECT, which finding the Tribunal
cannot make without having jurisdiction.

RREEF y. Spain II, {{582ff.); Foresight/Greentech v. Spain, {§525f.; Antin v. Spain, {721; SolEs v. Spain, $532. By
contrast, Cube v. Spain I, {{510-512 found (for hydro plants) that the Disputed Measures “offered the prospect of a
more stable regime for electricity pricing and, in consequence, less pressure to amend the regime further”. Similarly,
OREN v. Spain, §421h ruled that on the valuation date “there was a risk that Spain would not perform as promised and
that [...] Spain’s tariff reductions would not be considered violations of the ECT.”

However, Brattle argues that even if the Tribunal considers the TVPEE to be outside its
jurisdiction, the Tribunal would still need to decide on the time period during which the
TVPEE should apply in the but-for scenario, for two reasons. First, Brattle asserts that the
Respondent neutralized the effects of the TVPEE under RF3. Secondly, Brattle alleges that
the TVPEE was suspended in 2018-2019. In Brattle’s view, if the Tribunal considers on
the level of liability that the TVPEE had only a small or no effect because RF3 effectively
neutralized it (so that the TVPEE was “temporary” in Brattle’s terminology, i.e. until RF3
came into force), the consistent position on damages would be to likewise consider the
TVPEE temporary. Alternatively, Brattle finds it likewise possible to consider the TVPEE
permanent on both levels.!°?

Accuracy argues that if the Tribunal decides that is has no jurisdiction over the TVPEE,
the but-for scenario should include the TVPEE permanently because the but-for scenario
should reflect the regulatory framework in force before/without the breach. '°”°

The Tribunal agrees with Accuracy’s position. In the present context, the but-for scenario
is designed to determine the economic impact of the Disputes Measures as a criterion for
assessing a potential breach of the ECT. Therefore, the Tribunal must construct the but-for
scenario by removing from the actual scenario any and all Disputed Measures for which it
is at least possible that the Tribunal may find a breach of the ECT. No such possibility
exists for measures over which the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction. Accordingly, the TVPEE
must form part of the but-for world. This cannot change based on legislation that is
subsequent to the valuation date, forms part of the Disputed Measures and is thus to be
ignored in the but-for world. Also, there is no issue of consistency between responsibility
and damages because any damage that may have resulted from the TVPEE cannot
influence the Tribunal’s decision given that it has concluded that it does not have
jurisdiction.

(xv) Summary

In summary, while the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant in particular on the valuation
method and the valuation date, the Tribunal prefers to make more conservative assumptions
on multiple parameters, especially on the feed-in remuneration in the but-for scenario, the
projected lifetime of the Claimant’s facilities and their production levels. Similarly, the
Tribunal’s position on the discount rate and the regulatory risk strikes a balance between
the Parties’ positions.

The above assumptions have been communicated to the Parties by way of Procedural Order
No. 14 and subsequent instructions, based on which the Parties have agreed on the Joint
Model. The following analysis relies mainly on the numbers indicated in the Joint

1069 Brattle’s Memorandum of 5 August 2020, 4439-45.
1070 Accuracy’s Memorandum of 5 August 2020, 446-48.

Model.!°7! In some cases, however, the Tribunal will look, in addition, at the numbers
asserted by the Parties based on their respective own models.

(b) Analysis of the Economic Impact

852 The Claimant asserts that as a result of the Disputed Measures, “the vast majority of
renewable producers went bankrupt’.'°”? However, it does not offer much evidence for
this assertion. The most relevant!” piece of evidence on record is an evaluation by Brattle
of data from the Spanish National Statistical Institute. According to this evaluation, after
the announcement of the first Disputed Measures, the number of insolvencies of energy
firms increased by 161% compared to 2012, with a further increase by 28% in 2014.!0
However, the raw data underlying this evaluation was not submitted and it is unclear to
what extent those insolvencies related to renewables and, more specifically, to the wind
and CSP sectors. As Brattle itself acknowledges that an earlier spike in the number of
insolvencies (in 2011) mainly related to photovoltaic installations, it cannot be presumed
without further information that the insolvencies in 2013/2014 related to wind or CSP
installations.

853 That said, Iberedlica Solar was in fact declared insolvent under Spanish law and the
Claimant asserts that the insolvency proceedings would “surely” end up with Iberedlica
Solar being wound up.'°”> However, the Respondent disputes that this insolvency was a
result of the Disputed Measures. Instead, the Respondent claims that documents from the
insolvency proceedings show that the reasons for insolvency were (i) RDL 1/2012, which
caused Iberedlica Solar to abandon six other CSP projects not at issue in this arbitration,
exposing it to damages claims filed by contractual partners, (ii) the general economic crisis
and (iii) a higher level of third-party financing than other companies in the sector.'°”° The
first point was disputed by Mr. Gémez during his witness testimony,!°”’ but at the same

107 For some of the issues that are disputed between the Experts, the Joint Model allows the Tribunal to select different
options in multiple toggles. In accordance with the Tribunal’s findings above, the Tribunal has selected the “Primary
But For (§2.b)” as the “Active But-for Scenario”, “YES” for the toggles “7% Tax in But For” and “Regulated Tariff
(FIT) only”, “NO” for the toggle “7% tax Temporary/Neutralized (YES) or Permanent (NO)”, “Accuracy” for the
toggles “Actual scenario production” and “Standard Installation’s OPEX indexation”, “Pre-tax” for the toggle “Tax
Treatment” and “Plant” for the toggle “Plant or Standard Inst.?”.

1072 RoM, {{1455(iii), second bullet-point.

1073 Other documents on the record are mostly news articles and statements from sector associations that, however,
pre-date RD 413/2014 and MO IET/1045/2014 and merely voice the expectation that the anticipated changes would
create the risk of insolvency (BRR-96; BRR-97; BRR-98; BRR-99; BRR-100; BRR-101).

1074 BRR I, 174; see BRR II, Appendix A for an update including 2015 (which likewise does not reveal the number
of insolvencies in renewables/wind/CSP), which seems inconclusive because in Q1-Q3 the number of insolvencies is
not much higher and partially even lower than in 2011, while in Q4 there is a spike. The press report submitted as
BRR-153 essentially contains the same information as presented by Brattle.

time he acknowledged that unlike the SPVs that operated the abandoned CSP projects, the
CSP SPVs were able to avoid insolvency and were sold to a third party.!°"*

Based on the Parties’ submissions and the available documents from the insolvency
proceedings, the Tribunal does not find it established that Iberéolica Solar’s insolvency
was caused solely or primarily by the Disputed Measures (or that the Disputed Measures
bankrupted a significant number of companies in the Wind and CSP sectors). However,
the Tribunal does not consider that in order to establish a breach of Article 10(1) FET, the
Claimant would need to show that the Disputed Measures had this effect. Therefore, the
Tribunal now turns to the extent of the Disputed Measures’ economic impact below the
threshold of bankruptcy. The Tribunal will first analyse the impact on the IRRs of the
Claimant’s facilities (see subsection (i) infra). This will be followed by an analysis of the
impact on cash-flows (see subsection (ii) infra). Finally, the Tribunal will measure the IRRs
achieved by the Claimant’s facilities against the cost of capital (see subsection (iii) infra).

(i) Impact on IRRs
The Tribunal finds it appropriate to begin with a comparison between the IRRs that the

Claimant’s facilities can be expected to achieve in the actual scenario with those in the but-
for. Based on the Joint Model, this comparison looks as follows (pre-tax):

 

 

Hedroso Padornelo | Lubian Olivenza Morén
(wind) (wind) (wind) (CSP) (CSP)
But-for 9.45% 11.06% 10.69% 8.38% 8.49%

 

 

 

 

 

 

Actual

 

 

Accordingly, based on the Joint Model, all of the Claimant’s facilities saw a very
significant drop in their IRRs as a result of the Disputed Measures. This observation would
not change if one looked instead at the Claimant’s economic model.'°” Also, the
assessment is not called into question by the Respondent’s calculations as the Respondent
did not provide but-for IRRs based on its own economic assumptions.

1078 HT, Day 2, 14:2-14:14.
1079 Based on Brattles’ numbers, the IRR dropped between 30.2% and 52.4% depending on the facility, see CER-005,
Table 4 (Updated).

205

857 In addition to the comparison of actual and but-for IRRs, the Tribunal finds it useful to
compare the actual IRRs of the Claimant’s facilities with the RF1 Reference IRR. Even
though, given the absence of any specific commitment of Absolute Stability, the Claimant
could not legitimately expect that no changes at all would be made to RF1, the Tribunal
still considers the RF1 Reference IRR to be an important guiding figure that realistically
influenced any diligent investors’ legitimate expectation of Relative Stability. The actual
IRRs of the Claimant’s facilities compare as follows to the RF1 Reference IRR:

 

 

Hedroso Padornelo_ | Lubian Olivenza Morén
(wind) (wind) (wind) (CSP) (CSP)
Reference 8.1% 8.1% 8.1% 9.3% 9.3%

Model

858 With respect to the CSP Plants, it follows from the above comparison that based not only
on the Joint Model, but also the Respondent’s own numbers, the actual IRRs are
significantly below the relevant RF1 Reference IRR. That said, the Tribunal notes that
based on the Joint Model, the CSP Plants’ but-for IRRs (Olivenza: 8.38%; Morén: 8.49%)

1080 Wind Farms‘ pre-tax IRRs as per Joint Memorandum of 9 November 2020, {17 (Table 2).

108! Brattle did not calculate the CSP Plants’ pre-tax IRRs. However, it is clear that Brattle assumes lower pre-tax IRRs
than those calculated by Accuracy, cf. Brattle’s presentation “Changes to the Regulation of Wind and CSP Installations
in Spain”, slide 13.
1082 Accuracy II, [53 (Figure 4), [55 (Figure 5). For the CSP Plants, Accuracy applied certain “corrections” for alleged
inefficiencies, namely the investment costs (which were higher than initially projected and than foreseen in MO IET
1045/2014) and the investment period (which was 4 years instead of 18-24 months as foreseen in the PER 2005), see
Accuracy’s presentation “Quantum”, slides 6f.; Accuracy II, {[34-41.

 

  

206

likewise fall short of the RF1 Reference IRR (by 9.9% or 8.7%, respectively). !°3
Therefore, even if RF1 had remained in place, the CSP Plants could not have been expected
to achieve the RF1 Reference IRR. Consequently, one cannot say that the entire shortfall
between the CSP Plants’ actual IRRs and the RF1 Reference IRR is due to the Disputed
Measures. However, even deducting the aforementioned shortfall that would have existed
had RF1 remained in force, the additional shortfall inflicted by the Disputed Measures still
exceeds 30 percentage points, as per the Joint Model, which the Tribunal finds to be a very
significant impact.

859 As to the Wind Farms, both the Joint Model and the Claimant’s own model indicate that
the actual IRRs are lower than the RF1 Reference IRR. The Tribunal does not consider the
Respondent’s numbers, which are not based on a true DCF calculation,'** to cast doubt on
this result of the analysis. The Tribunal notes that in relation to Padornelo and Lubian, the
Claimant’s own numbers suggest a shortfall that is much smaller than for the CSP Plants!
and that could, at least in the case of Padornelo, be considered negligible. However, the
Tribunal also notes that this does not detract from the fact that, equally based on the
Claimant’s own model, the change from RF1 to RF3 was very significant: it appears that
only because Padornelo and Lubian could be expected to beat the RFI Reference IRR by
a very big margin in the but-for scenario, the Disputed Measures brought them merely
slightly below that benchmark in the actual scenario.!°°°

860  Insummary, therefore, the analysis shows that as a result of the Disputed Measures, all of
the Claimant’s facilities have seen a very significant decrease in their IRRs. This has caused
the Wind Farms to fall below the RF1 Reference IRR, while the CSP Plants’ pre-existing
shortfall compared to the RF1 Reference IRR has increased significantly.

(ii) Impact on Cash-flows

861 Asis undisputed between the Parties, it is common practice for renewable energy projects
to rely heavily on project financing.'°*’ The logic behind project financing relies on the
assumption that the asset itself will generate steady and predictable streams of revenue to

1083 See the table in {741 supra.

1084 Instead of assuming that RFI remains in place and produces respective cash-flows for the lifetime of the plants,
Accuracy allocated to the Wind Farms such revenue that would yield an IRR that Accuracy deems reasonable
(Accuracy 1, $808, 811; Accuracy II, {199), namely 9.5% on equity. This reflects the CAPM calculated by Accuracy
for 2003, which they consider to be the time of the “real” investment in the Wind Farms, because at that time Condeu
(fully owned by Mr. Gémez and later acquired by the Claimant) acquired indirect stakes in the Wind Farms, cf.
Accuracy I, {124, 203; Accuracy II, 9107, 199, 201, 205.

1085 As noted in fn. 1081 supra, while Brattle did not calculate the CSP Plants’ pre-tax IRRs, it is clear that Brattle
assumes lower pre-tax IRRs than those calculated by Accuracy.

1086 While the Claimant did not provide pre-tax IRRs for the Wind Farms in the but-for scenario, the Tribunal estimates
them to be 10.0% for Hedroso, 12.0% for Padornelo and 11.6% for Lubian, based on the post-tax IRRs (including
financing) calculated by the Claimant (CER-005, Table 4 (Updated)) and the effective tax rates underlying the Joint
Model for a conversion of the Wind Farms’ post-tax IRRs (including financing) into pre-tax IRRs. Accordingly, had
RFI remained in place, Padornelo and Lubian could have been expected to beat the RF1 Reference IRR by more than
40% based on the Claimant’s numbers.

1087 MoM, 1543-547; the Respondent acknowledged this already in its PER 2005, Section 4.5.

    

207

service the debt.'°** Accordingly, the cash-flows generated by renewables projects are of
essential importance for the repayment of their loans.'°* Therefore, in order to assess the
economic impact of the Disputed Measures, the Tribunal finds that it must look not only at
the IRR (even though important given the fundamental role it played for the Respondent
in devising the remunerative regimes) but also at how the cash-flows of CSP Plants and
Wind Farms were affected.!°°°

Based on the Joint Model, the cash-flows in the but-for and actual scenarios compare as
follows (in million EUR):

Hedroso | Padornelo | LubidnI | Lubian II | Olivenza | Morén
(wind) (wind) (wind) (wind) (CSP) (CSP)

But-for | 30 31 38 17 347 372
Actual | 10 10 16 14 253 257

A

 

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that while the effect on cash-flows varies considerably
between the different facilities, all of them saw a very significant fall in their cash-flows at
project-level. At the level of the Claimant’s shareholding, these losses add up to
approximately EUR 55.4 million.!°! While this is significantly less than the EUR 141
asserted by the Claimant, it is still a very significant amount that is also much higher than
on the Respondent’s case, which is that either the Claimant suffered no damages at all
(ABV calculation) or, at most, EUR 7.4 million (subsidiary DCF calculation).

For comparison, based on the Claimant’s DCF model, the cash-flows in the actual and but-
for scenarios compare as follows (in million EUR):!°

1089 MoM, 319.

While the Respondent’s primary damage calculation rest on the ABV methodology, it
provided a subsidiary DCF calculation based on which the cash-flows under the actual and
but-for scenarios compare as follows!:

Actual | 17.7 20.6 38.5 308.3 318.6

A

 

Accordingly, both Parties calculate significant cash-flow reductions for Hedroso, Olivenza
and Moron. This further confirms the Tribunal’s findings based on the Joint Model. While
the Claimant alleges significant reductions also for Padornela and Lubian, as does the Joint
Model, the Respondent asserts that Padornelo lost relatively little cash-flow while Lubian’s
cash-flow even increased as a result of the Disputed Measures. However, as mentioned
before, the Respondent subsidiary DCF calculation is not in fact based on the cash-flows
that an unchanged RF1 would have yielded.'°** Therefore, the Tribunal does not consider
that the Respondent’s model calls into question the findings made on the basis of the Joint
Model.

(iii) Comparison with Cost of Capital

While the previous two sections sought to determine the economic impact of the Disputed
Measures by comparing RFI and RF3, the present section aims at ascertaining how

1085 Accuracy I, {1752 (CSP), 817 (Wind); Accuracy II, 231 (Wind).
1094 See fn, 1084 supra.

209

reasonable the return offered by RF3 is compared to the risks undertaken by the Claimant,
as reflected in the cost of capital.'° In other words, while the previous analyses sought to
ascertain how much was ‘taken away’ from the Claimant as a result of the Disputed
Measures, the following comparison with the cost of capital seeks to determine whether
what is still left (i.e. the remuneration under RF3) is reasonable in the sense of maintaining
the efficiency of the investment — irrespective of whether the previous regulatory regime
offered even higher returns.

868 The Respondent has submitted,'”® and the Tribunal in principle agrees, that the CAPM is
an appropriate benchmark for this analysis. While the CAPM disregards external financing,
so did the Respondent when devising the remunerative regime for both RF1 and RF3.!°”

869 However, for the present purposes,'°* the Tribunal finds it appropriate to take regulatory
risk into account when determining the applicable CAPM. This is because an investment
will only be made if the expected IRR is high enough to compensate the investor for all
risks involved in the project, i.e. including any regulatory risk.'” Therefore, if the CAPM
is to serve as an indicator of the reasonableness of the IRR offered by RF3, regulatory risk
must be included in the calculation of the CAPM. Accordingly, the Tribunal must add to
the discount rate of 4.115%, as calculated in the framework of the DCF analysis,!!°° a
regulatory risk premium. As the analysis concerns the actual scenario, for which the
Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s position that tariff deficit securities have a rating of
BBB+,!!°! the Tribunal must determine how this rating translates into a regulatory risk
premium to be added to the discount rate. The Tribunal finds it appropriate to rely in this
regard on the “Rating-based Default Spread” study of Professor Aswath Damodaran

10°5 The Tribunal notes that such comparison with the cost of capital was relied on also by the tribunal in RREEF v.

Spain II, 1574, to determine whether RF3 grants a reasonable rate of return; to similar effect, albeit in the context of
quantum, NextEra v. Spain, {662-666; Cavalum v. Spain, (687.

1096 Accuracy II, Figures 4, 5 (while Accuracy uses the term “WACC”, i.e. the abbreviation of Weighted Average Cost
of Capital, which unlike the CAPM takes into account external financing, the number they refer to is derived from a
CAPM calculation, as is clear from Accuracy II, 952 (fn. 21), 154, (fn. 22), in conjunction with Accuracy I, Annexes
10, 11). The Tribunal notes that in BQR II, {12, Brattle merely takes issue with a comparison between the IRR and
the WACC because the former is an equity return while the latter includes debt; this seems to imply that, as a matter
of principle, comparing the IRR with the CAPM is acceptable to Brattle, as well.

10% The Tribunal notes that the tribunals in RREEF v. Spain II, [577, and arguably also in NextEra v. Spain, 611,
compared IRRs to the WACC instead of the CAPM. In the present case, neither party made submissions on the precise
debt ratio or the cost of debt in relation to the CSP Plants or Wind Farms. Thus, the Tribunal is not in a position to
determine whether a comparison taking into account the effects of external financing would have yielded a different
result.

10°8 Contrary to the CAPM calculation used to determine the discount rate in the framework of the DCF analysis. In
that context, regulatory risk was treated separately and to avoid double-counting, it could not then again be included
in the CAPM calculation.

109 See the statement to this effect of Brattle’s Mr. Lapuerta at the hearing, see HT, Day 4, 17:2-11; see also Accuracy
1, 49319, 325. While Mr. Lapuerta referred also to other types of risks that he felt were missing in the comparison
between IRRs and CAPMs (construction risk, technological and illiquidity risk), the Tribunal is not in a position
to quantify those risks in the form of premiums to be added to CAPMs. However, whatever those premiums may be,
they would in any case have increased the CAPM, which in turn would only have lent further support to the
conclusions drawn below.

1100 See 4841 supra.

101 See 4842 supra.

referred to by Accuracy for the same purpose.!!°? The Tribunal is aware that this study is
based on public information related to generic investments for the country in question and
therefore does not take into account the specific elements of the Claimant’s investment.!!°
Nonetheless, the Tribunal is satisfied that its approach is sufficiently accurate for the
present analysis, which is not concerned with quantifying precise damages but rather
appreciating the magnitude of the economic effect of the Disputed Measures. Based on the
said study, the rating of BBB+ translates into a regulatory risk premium of 2.2 percentage
points that must be added to the CAPM. As the Tribunal assumes a CAPM excluding
regulatory risk of 4.115%, this yields a CAPM including regulatory risk of 6.315%.!!

870 The Tribunal notes that other tribunals have considered that the appropriate benchmark for
the reasonableness of the return is the cost of capital plus a premium.''!°> However, as the
CAPM used by the Tribunal already includes regulatory risk and as no specific additional
premium is obvious from the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal does not consider it
appropriate to add any further premium for the purposes of the present analysis.!!°°

871 On this basis, the CAPM compares as follows to the RF3 Target IRR!!"7:

 

Wind Farms CSP Plants

 

CAPM 6.315% 6.315%

RF3 Target IRR

872 When looking instead at the real-life IRRs of the Claimant’s facilities as projected by the
Joint Model in the actual scenario, the comparison looks as follows:

 

 

 

 

1102 See Accuracy II, {A.83. The Tribunal does not consider it possible to rely instead on the regulatory risk premiums
calculated by Brattle (see 842 supra). Those premiums reflect asset yields that were derived from the cash-flows
projected by Brattle (taking into account regulatory risk) (see BQR I, {{[132-136). As Brattle’s cash-flow projections
are based on a number of assumptions that are not shared by the Tribunal (see section VII.A.2.d.iii(2)(a) supra), the
Tribunal presumes that the regulatory risk premiums implicit in Brattle’s model are different from those implicit in
the Joint Model relied upon by the Tribunal.

1103 See Accuracy II, JA.85.

1104 The Tribunal is aware that there are different approaches to incorporating country risk (of which regulatory risk
forms part) into the CAPM. However, as both Parties have taken the approach of simply adding the applicable
regulatory risk premium to their CAPM (rather than, e.g., first multiplying the regulatory risk premium with beta), the
Tribunal finds it appropriate to follow this approach.

1105 One percentage point in RREEF vy. Spain II, [588; two percentage points in NextEra v. Spain, 1666.

1106 The Tribunal notes that contrary to what seems to have been before the tribunals in RREEF v. Spain II, 4588 and
NextEra v. Spain, (662, there is no submission before this Tribunal as to any intentions of the regulator, at the time of
the investment, to offer investors a specific premium to the cost of capital.

1107 CAPMs are, by definition, post-tax and excluding financing. Consistent with the finding in {738 supra, the RF3
Target IRRs have thus been converted into post-tax numbers (excluding financing) by using Accuracy’s conversion
rate, see Joint Memorandum of 16 December 2020, [4 (Table 2).

In addition, it is noteworthy that in the but-for scenario, the projected IRRs of the Claimant’

CAPM | 6.315% | 6.315% 6.315% 6.315% 6.315%

 

 

 

 

 

 

But-for
IRR

 

Accordingly, while the but-for IRRs are above the cost of capital, the RF3 Target IRRs are
lower and the actual IRRs very much lower than the cost of capital for all of the Claimant’s
facilities.

In the Tribunal’s view, this shows that when the Claimant made its investment, it was an
efficient investment decision because the Claimant's facilities could be expected to achieve
IRRs well in excess of the cost of capital. By contrast, once the Disputed Measures were
enacted, none of the Claimant’s facilities could anymore be expected to exceed the cost of
capital, neither based on the RF3 Target IRR nor — much less — based on actual IRRs. In
other words, the Tribunal finds that this analysis confirms the above general observation
that the change of the remuneration system introduced by the Disputed Measures rendered
previously efficient investments inefficient.

(iv) Summary

Irrespective of whether one looks at IRRs or cash-flows, it is obvious to the Tribunal that
from an economic perspective, the Disputed Measures had a very significant adverse
impact on all of the Claimant’s facilities. This is true in particular for the Wind Farms,
whose IRRs under RFI could be expected to comfortably outperform the RF1 Reference
IRR. By contrast, under RF3, the IRRs dropped so much that they now remain significantly

1108 As the Tribunal assumes that regulatory risk is the same in the but-for scenario as in the actual scenario (see [844
above), the regulatory risk premium and, thus, the CAPM remains the same.

212

879

below even the lower RF3 Target IRR. In addition, on average, their cash-flows decreased
by more than 50%. While the CSP Plants were anyway set to fall short of the RF1
Reference IRR, the Tribunal does not consider that this can detract from the fact that they
were likewise severely affected by RF3. Their IRRs dropped by percentages that are not
much lower than for at least two of the Wind Farms. This has caused the CSP Plant’s IRRs
to fall significantly below the RF3 Target IRR, which they would have remained well
above of with the remuneration scheme of RFI. Also, on average, their cash-flows
decreased by almost 30%.

In addition, even if one disregarded the fact that the remuneration under RF3 is significantly
lower than under RF1, and instead merely looked at RF3 in isolation, the rates of return
offered by RF3 to any of the Claimant’s facilities are lower than the cost of capital
(including regulatory risk) as at the valuation date.'!” Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes
that on the valuation date, no investor would have invested in the CSP Plants and Wind
Farms in view of the Disputed Measures. This, in turn, implies that the rate of return offered
by RF3 is not reasonable for pre-existing facilities such as the CSP Plants and Wind Farms.

In making this finding, the Tribunal has taken into account that at the time the Claimant’s
investment was made, the IRRs that the Claimant’s facilities could be expected to achieve
under RFI exceeded both the cost of capital and the RF1 Reference IRR by significant
margins. For this reason, the Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent’s assertion that
the low actual IRRs under RF3 are mainly due to inefficiencies at the Claimant’s facilities,
as opposed to them being a result of the Disputed Measures.

The Tribunal does not find the foregoing to be called into question by the fact, invoked by
the Respondent, that in 2009, APPA and Greenpeace published a draft bill for the
promotion of renewable energies in which they proposed a target rate of return equivalent
to the average yield of 10-year Spanish government bonds, plus a spread of 300 basis
points.!!!° First, while at first sight this target rate of return is identical to the RF3 Target
IRR, the Tribunal notes that it is unclear whether the rate of return proposed by APPA and
Greenpeace is pre-tax (as in RF3!""') or post-tax (which would be in line with RF1, i.e. the
regime in place at the time the proposal was made, where the RF1 Reference IRR was
always post-tax and excluding financing). If it was meant to be a post-tax rate of return, it
would in fact be significantly higher than the RF3 Target IRR. Secondly, the Respondent
does not claim and the Tribunal has no reason to believe that the rate of return proposed by
APPA and Greenpeace was intended to apply to pre-existing facilities, much less
retrospectively by taking into account remuneration paid under previous regimes.!!!?
Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the APPA/Greenpeace proposal does not support the

make it fully comparable to the IRRs, see fn. 1099 supra.

Respondent’s position that the remunerative regime of RF3 was reasonable for facilities
such as the Wind Farms and CSP Plants.

Similarly, while according to the EC State Aid Decision the RF3 Target IRR “appear|s] to
be in line with the rates of return of renewable energy [...] projects recently approved with
the Commission” in France, Italy, Estonia and Latvia,''!? this does not mean that in those
four countries similar rates of return were applied (much less retrospectively) to facilities
that were built and started operating under a more favourable previous remunerative
regime. Indeed, the Respondent has not submitted that this is what happened in those four
countries. In addition, even if that were the case, it would not necessarily follow that the
RF3 Target IRR is reasonable.

(3) Abruptness of the Change

The Respondent claims that it announced by late 2011 the changes that would be brought
about by the Disputed Measures.'!'* Also, it asserts that none of the changes are retroactive
in nature.!!!5

The Claimant submits that the details of the new regulatory regime were not even clear in
July 2013 when RDL 9/2013 repealed RF1, given that it took the Respondent another year
to approve RD 413/2013, MO IET/1045/2014 and MO IET/1882/2014.'!'® Furthermore,
the Claimant argues that RF3 was retroactive in two ways. First, payments of feed-in
remuneration made to a facility under RF1 were deducted from the payments to which the
facility was entitled under RF3.'!!” Secondly, RDL 2/2013, which suppressed the Pool
Price Plus Premium option and indexed the remuneration parameters to a new index instead
of the CPI, was adopted on 1 February 2013, but with an effective date of 1 January
2013.'!!8 Lastly, the Claimant highlights the lack of any transitional regime that could have
allowed existing facilities to adapt to RF2/3.'!!

Based on the record, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the Respondent did not
sufficiently warn renewable energy producers before RDL 2/2013 suppressed the Pool
Price Plus Premium option and RDL 9/2013 replaced RF1 with the principles of RF3. The
Tribunal is not convinced that any of the public statements it was referred to by the
Respondent, most of which also post-date the Claimant’s investment, show otherwise.!!?°

held on 19 December 2011!!! merely constituted a general political statement about the

need for reform to address the Tariff Deficit. However, it was completely unclear which
direction such reform could take — in particular, how severe it was going to be and which
stakeholders were going to be affected in what way.

Similarly, it is true that a press release by the CNE on 28 December 2011 stressed “the
need to immediately implement, amongst other measures, proposals for the regulation of
activities, aimed at getting rid of the system’s structural deficit”.!'*> However, this press
release then goes on to suggest certain measures that could be taken, with none of them
being a general reduction of the feed-in remuneration paid to renewable energy producers,
much less to existing installations.!!?

A first hint at the magnitude of possible changes was a report issued by CNE on 7 March
2012, which stated that “[d]ue to the high cost of the remuneration of the special regime
equivalent premium, the difficulty of its funding by access tariffs (taking into account the
current economic imbalance in the electricity system) as well as the necessary review of
efficiency incentives in the current regulation, the current regulation must be reviewed”,
and proposed a number of significant changes.''!?* However, the Ministry of Energy —
which would be in charge of implementing such changes — distanced itself from the report
the day after it received it.'!”> In addition, the measures proposed in the CNE report were
not as far-reaching for renewable producers!!”° as the Disputed Measures.

Other statements referred to by the Respondent!!?” remained too vague for them to have
served as a sufficient warning of the legislative changes about to be implemented some
months later. Moreover, in January, March and July 2012, the Respondent adopted
legislative measures that did not affect renewable energy facilities or at least not those
registered in the Remuneration Pre-Allocation Registry or in RAIPRE,'!* which may well
have reinforced the impression of investors that the Tariff Deficit would be addressed
without changing the economic regime in place for registered renewables facilities.

Accordingly, based on the record, it appears that the enactment of RDL 2/2013 and RDL
9/2013 came quite suddenly indeed. This impression is only reinforced by the CNE
criticizing the legislator for having submitted to it the first draft of RDL 9/2019 at such
short notice that it “does not allow to guarantee an effective participation of the different
agents affected” .!'°

In addition, the Tribunal considers that there is indeed an element of retrospectivity that is
imminent to RF3 because if a facility has already received payments under the previous

regulatory framework, such payments will be deducted from the overall remuneration that
the facility would otherwise receive under RF3.!!*° This clawback essentially put producers
in the same position as if RD 661/2007 had never existed!!! — unless, of course, the facility
in question had already achieved before the adoption of RF3 an IRR that was higher than
the RF3 Target IRR, because in that case the producer would at least be able to keep what
could be considered an “overpayment” in the eyes of RF3. That said, none of the
Claimant’s facilities fall into this latter category.!!°?

890 Moreover, the Tribunal finds that RDL 2/2013 had retroactive effect because it took effect
on | January 2013 even though it was adopted only one month later, on 1 February
2013.1!33

891 Finally, it is true that RDL 9/2013 repealed RD 661/2007 with immediate effect, without
providing for a true transitional period in which existing facilities could adapt to the new
situation. While RDL 9/2013 provided that producers would temporarily continue to
receive remuneration as per the values of the previous regime, this was subject to a final
settlement once the remuneration values of RF3 were set. In other words, in the end
producers would not receive more than what was owed to them under RF3, as of the coming
into force of RDL 9/2013.

892 In summary, therefore, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent replaced the
remunerative regime of RD 661/2007, as amended by RD 1614/2010, very abruptly indeed:
without sufficient prior warning, without a true transitional regime and with elements of
retroactivity or at least retrospectivity.

(4) Change of External Circumstances

893 Consistent with contemporaneous statements it made after RD 1614/2010 had been
adopted (i.e. after RF1 had been completed),!'! the Respondent submits that the Disputed
Measures are justified because of the soaring Tariff Deficit, the rise of energy prices for
consumers and the existence of over-remuneration in the renewables sector.!!°°

894 The Claimant, by contrast, argues that the Tariff Deficit cannot justify the Disputed
Measures, mainly for two reasons. First, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent itself
created the Tariff Deficit by refusing, for political reasons, to fix network access tolls at a
level that reflected the true cost of electricity.!'*° Secondly, in 2007, when according to the

Claimant the Tariff Deficit was huge already, the Respondent took the conscious policy
decision of giving priority to the development of renewable energy, by choosing to
implement a highly attractive remunerative regime by virtue of RD 661/2007.!!*”

The Tribunal considers that the Claimant’s arguments overlook the fact that at the end of
2007, a very significant part of the accumulated Tariff Deficit (almost 40% thereof) was
due to a very high deficit in 2005, whereas in 2006 and 2007 the annual deficits decreased
significantly and steadily.''** Accordingly, the Tribunal is not convinced that, at the time,
the Tariff Deficit appeared to be structural. Only after RD 661/2007 was adopted, due to
the global financial crisis that began in the end of 2007, and the ensuing severe economic
crisis in Spain, the demand in energy in Spain increased much less than expected in 2008
and decreased in 2009, for the very first time for 25 years, instead of further increasing as
had been projected.''*? At the time, the wind power association AEE acknowledged an
“exceptional fall in the demand for electricity”.'"*° After a slight recovery in 2010, the
decline in energy demand continued from 2011 to 2013.''*! Even though the energy prices
for consumers increased by more than 60% between 2007 and 2012,'!? the Tariff Deficit
still increased by 365% during the same time period.''

The Tribunal has no hesitation to find that the global financial crisis, which led to a severe
economic crisis in Spain (and elsewhere in Europe) that, in turn, exacerbated the Tariff
Deficit dramatically, was in fact an extraordinary change of external circumstances that
post-dated RD 661/2007 and that was an important reason behind the adoption of the
Disputed Measures.''#4 While it may well be that the Respondent’s past policy to keep
network access tolls were also a significant factor contributing to the size of the Tariff
Deficit, it would not be appropriate to negate the great impact that the very exceptional
economic surroundings between 2008 and 2014 had on the Tariff Deficit, irrespective of
the Respondent’s policy on network access tolls. Although it is true that a significant Tariff
Deficit existed already when the Respondent decided to offer investors an attractive
remunerative regime through RD 661/2007, this policy decision did not prevent the
Respondent from changing course once it faced the very exceptional economic
circumstances that occurred thereafter. !!4°

897 Therefore, the Tribunal finds that at least one of the triggers for the Disputed Measures was
a significant change of external circumstances.

(5) Public Interests Involved

898 The Tribunal has no hesitation to find that the reliability a State’s electricity system is of
vital public interest. This was also expressly reflected in the Preamble of Law 54/1997!14¢
and it cannot therefore have come as a surprise to any diligent investor that the Respondent
attached great importance to this policy objective. Equally, the Tribunal has no doubt that
before the Disputed Measures were taken, the Tariff Deficit in Spain had begun to pose a
serious risk to the economic sustainability of the SES. In fact, this does not seem to be in
dispute between the Parties. Given that the Disputed Measures (just like previous measures,
such as RD 1614/2010!'*”) were clearly aimed at reducing the Tariff Deficit, as was
acknowledged by both Parties in this arbitration,''4* they objectively pursued an important
public interest.

899 — While the Claimant may be correct that there would have been different ways in which the
Respondent could have tackled the Tariff Deficit, e.g. through network access tolls or by
levying a CO2 tax,!!? it is not for the Tribunal to pass judgment on what would have been
the best policy decision for the Respondent to take.''*° Rather, in the present context, it
suffices to note that cutting costs of the system by reducing the remuneration payable to
renewable (and other) energy producers is not per se an unsuitable means to pursue the
important public interest of tackling the Tariff Deficit and thereby safeguarding the
economic sustainability of the electricity system.!!>!

900 At the same time, the Tribunal notes that increasing the use of green energy is likewise of
vital public interest, given in particular the positive impact on the environment. Indeed, the
Respondent itself committed to pursuing this interest many times, not least in the Preamble
of Law 54/1997,''? and is also under an obligation to do so under EU law, in particular
pursuant to EU Directive 2009/28/EC.!!*? As it seems difficult to deny that, at least in the
short term, the Disputed Measures make investments in green energy projects in Spain less
attractive to investors,''*+ the Disputes Measures could be seen to run counter to the public
interest in saving the environment.!!>>

1146 ‘The Preamble of Law 54/1997 (C-0060/R-0003) reads: “The supply of electric power is essential for the
functioning of our society.” [as per the Claimant’s translation; the Respondent’s translation is identical in substance].
1147 See Ministry of Energy, Press Release of 2 July 2010 (C-0247); see also AEE, Press Release of 9 December 2010
(C-0263).

1154 While the Respondent submits that RF3 is still attracting significant investment, it does not seem to dispute that
the economic regime of RF3 is less attractive to investors than the one of RF1.

1155 Cf C-PHB, {9200f.

   
 

 

218

901 However, balancing competing public interests is one of the core responsibilities and
prerogatives of a State. The Tribunal does not find it appropriate to second-guess the
Respondent’s assessment at the time that, at least for the time being, it was more important
to bring the Tariff Deficit under control than to keep incentives for investment in green
energy at the same level as before. This policy choice is not manifestly unreasonable, in
particular as an economically unsustainable electricity system is also likely to deter future
investment into green energy projects. Therefore, the Tribunal will defer to the
Respondent’s policy choice of according priority to the reduction of the Tariff Deficit.
Based thereon, the Tribunal finds that the Disputed Measures do pursue the overriding
public interest of ensuring the sustainability of the SES.

(6)  Prior!!%° Legislative Practice

902 The Claimant asserts that any changes to the regulatory framework introduced before its
investment continuously improved the attractiveness to investors,''*’ never affected
existing facilities''®8 and, in addition, even made sure that transitional regimes allowed
investors to adopt to the new regulatory framework.''*° By contrast, the Respondent claims
that the guiding thread of all legislative changes has always been to protect the
sustainability of the SES and to prevent overcompensation.''® Also, the Respondent
submits that even before the Disputed Measures were adopted, many legislative measures
were criticized by the renewable sector as retroactively affecting facilities already in
operation.!!6!

903 To begin with, the Tribunal notes that prior to the Disputed Measures, the Respondent
amended the regulatory framework for renewable energy production multiple times within
a relatively short period of time. Specifically, even if one counts only the main legislative
measures, the Respondent enacted five comprehensive pieces of legislation between 1997
and 2007, i.e. on average one every other year.''®? Hence, the Tribunal considers that the
Respondent’s legislative practice in this field of law was characterized by constant
change.!!®

1156 In CC on ECT Decisions, (47-54, the Claimant also invokes RDL 17/2019, i.e. legislation subsequent to the
Disputed Measures, arguing in particular that it confirms that RF3 does not provide legal stability and is arbitrary. The
Tribunal does not share the Claimant’s view that RDL 17/2019 is relevant to the assessment of whether the Disputed
Measures are in breach of the ECT (see also fn. 920 supra). If at all, RDL 17/2009 may itself amount to a breach of
the ECT, which however is not a question that is before this Tribunal.

219

904 Contrary to the Claimant’s allegation, the Tribunal finds that such change was not always
to the benefit of investors.'!* This holds true in particularly in the case of RDL 7/2006,
which froze tariffs by de-linking them from the TMR, which link had led to high returns
previously.''!® Also, while RD 661/2007 may have brought about certain improvements to
renewables investors, it did result in lower tariffs to wind farms at least in the first seven
months after it entered into force,!'!® and apparently also in 2008, 2011 and 2012.!!®7 In
addition, the fact that practically all wind farms in Spain opted to remain under
RD 436/2004 during a transitional period until 31 December 2012, despite the tariffs and
premiums under RD 436/2004 remaining frozen to the values of 2007,''% likewise
indicates that, at the time, RD 661/2007 was not considered by the wind sector to clearly
result in higher remuneration.!!® Moreover, the Tribunal notes that the PER 2005, to which
RD 661/2007 makes express reference, concluded that in order to achieve the renewable
energy targets for 2010, no change was required to the remuneration regime as regards CSP
and wind energy.''” This likewise suggests that it is not entirely accurate when the
Claimant characterizes RD 661/2007 as aiming mainly at benefitting investors, in
particular in the fields of CSP and wind energy.

905 Accordingly, the Respondent implementing further changes in 2013 and 2014 that
adversely affected investors and even existing installations was not per se out of line with
the legislative behaviour that the Respondent had displayed before the Claimant’s
investment on 6 November 2007, even though the magnitude of the changes was different.

906 Furthermore, it is undisputed that prior to the Disputed Measures, the Respondent refrained
from setting out a specific rate of return (much less specific remuneration values) on the
level of a Law. Instead, Law 54/1997 merely provided for the requirement of a “reasonable
rate of profitability” while leaving the development of the remuneration scheme achieving
this objective to implementing RDs and MOs. It seems that market actors were aware that
this provided less security for investors as opposed to a Law setting out the rate of return
(which could only be changed by parliament).''”! That said, prior to the Disputed
Measures, there was in fact a common thread in the IRR underlying both the PER 2000!!72
and the PER 2005,'!” which made reference to 7% post-tax and pre-financing,'!” as did

1164 Same view BayWa v. Spain, 1471.

2006 (R-0224), p. 4f. of the PDF. See also RWE Innogy v. Spain, {539.

1167 RWS-CMR2, (42.

1168 RjoM, 9195, 469; RWS-CMR2, 942.

116 The Claimant argues the Wind SPVs opted to remain under RD 436/2004 for stability reasons because they and
their lenders preferred to maintain a remuneration scheme that had already been tested (MoM, 261; RjoM, {11 1(ii)).
However, if RD 661/2007 was such a clear improvement as argued by Claimant, this explanation does not seem
entirely credible.

1171 See Miguel Mendonca/David Jacobs/Benjamin Sovacool, Powering the Green Economy Manual, 2010 (RL-0078),

the press releases accompanying the draft and final versions of RD 661/2007 for the
regulated tariff for wind power facilities (while for CSP the rate indicated was 8%).!!75
Thus, with the exception of the lower end of the IRR spectrum for wind facilities under the
Pool Price Plus Premium Option of RD 661/2007 (5%), the lowest pre-financing and post-
tax IRR mentioned was always 7% post-tax. The Disputed Measures setting the post-tax
target IRR to 6.049% for the Wind Farms and 6.225% for the CSP Plants!!° does therefore
mark a departure from an established legislative practice as it existed prior to Claimant’s
investment on 6 November 2007.

907 With respect to the Claimant’s assertion that legislation adopted prior to the Disputed
Measures had never had any retroactive effect on existing facilities, the Tribunal is not
satisfied that this is accurate. In particular, such assertion is contradicted by the
understanding of renewable energy associations at the time, who criticized
RD 436/2004,''” RDL 7/2006!!78 and RD 661/2007!'” for what they considered to be
retroactive changes to the previous regulatory frameworks affecting facilities in
operation.!!*°

908 As to the Claimant’s argument on the Respondent’s past practice of implementing
transitional regimes, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent introduced three successive
remunerative regimes after the enactment of Law 54/1997: first RD 2818/1998, then
RD 436/2004 and finally RD 661/2007 (the latter eventually amended by RD 1614/2010).
The transitions from one regime to the other were indeed always facilitated by transitional
periods during which existing facilities would stay (or at least could opt to stay) under the
previous regime for a certain period of time.''*! By contrast, the Respondent did not include
such transitional regime when introducing RF3.''*? In this regard, therefore, the
Respondent did in fact act out of line with its prior legislative behaviour in the same field.

(7) — Stability Assurances

909 As set out in {1663-679 supra, the Respondent’s statements and actions invoked by the
Claimant do not rise to the level of specific commitments that could have created a
legitimate expectation of Absolute Stability, i.e. that RF1 would remain unchanged.

However, by repeatedly making legislative!'** and other public statements!'** that

underlined the Respondent’s awareness of the importance of regulatory stability, the
Respondent did reinforce the legitimate expectation of Relative Stability. By doing so, the
Tribunal finds that the Respondent somewhat narrowed the margin of changes that are
acceptable under the FET standard,''*> as compared to a case in which a host State merely
enacts a support scheme for renewables without giving any of the (albeit soft) assurances
of stability that the Respondent gave.

(8) Conclusion
In summary, the above analysis has shown that the Disputed Measures

(i) fundamentally changed essential elements of RFI by (i) materially altering the
Respondent’s understanding of what was an appropriate return on investments in
wind farms and CSP plants, and (ii) replacing the previous system of remuneration
with a substantially different one that places much less importance on the amount
of energy produced,

(ii) had a severe adverse economic impact on the Claimant’s facilities, both in terms
of cash-flows and IRRs, and resulted in a rate of return that is insufficient in
comparison with the Claimant’s cost of capital,

(iii) were adopted without any transitional period (contrary to previous legislation in
the field) and contained elements of retroactivity (RDL 2/2013 taking effect one
month prior to its adoption) and retrospectivity (effective claw-back of
remuneration paid under RF1),

(iv) were triggered, inter alia, by the global financial crisis and the ensuing economic
crisis in Spain, which had an unforeseeable adverse effect on the energy demand
in Spain, and thus significantly exacerbated the Tariff Deficit,

(v) pursued an important public interest, namely safeguarding the sustainability of the
SES and

(vi) were not per se inconsistent with the Respondent’s legislative behaviour before
the Claimant’s investment, namely to frequently change the regulatory framework
for renewable energy production, also for existing facilities and sometimes to the
detriment of investors; however, the magnitude of the adverse change was
different and the RF3 Target IRR did depart from what had been a relatively stable
understanding by the Respondent as to what was a reasonable rate of return.

In addition, the above analysis has shown that while the Respondent made no commitment
of Absolute Stability, it repeatedly made statements underlining the importance of
regulatory stability, thus somewhat narrowing the acceptable margin of change under the
notion of Relative Stability.

Putting these results of the analysis together, the Tribunal’s view is that a diligent investor
in wind and CSP projects would, at the time the Claimant invested, have expected that in
case of a global and severe economic crisis and a steep incline of the Tariff Deficit, the
Respondent would adopt measures to safeguard the sustainability of the SES. A diligent
investor would also have expected that those measures might adversely affect even existing
wind and CSP projects, as had previous reforms in Spain. The Tribunal finds, however,
that no diligent investor would have expected measures with such far-reaching effects on
investments as the Disputed Measures. Specifically, no investor could have anticipated that
the Respondent would change the level of remuneration and the entire remunerative system
as dramatically and as abruptly as it did, resulting in an adverse impact on the Claimant’s
investment that, taking into account all circumstances, the Tribunal considers to be
dispropriate even in the face of the economic crisis prevailing at the time. Therefore, the
Tribunal finds that the Disputed Measures were a radical departure from RF1 and thus
violated the ECT’s FET standard by thwarting the Claimant’s legitimate expectation of
Relative Stability.

However, in line with the above analysis, the Tribunal exempts from this finding notably
the following measures, which the Tribunal considers were not radical but rather remained
within the acceptable margin of change:

(i) RDL 2/2013, which replaced the inflation index and effectively abolished the Pool
Price Plus Premium option. However, the Tribunal finds that its retroactive
application, as of 1 January 2013 instead of 1 February 2013, was in breach of the
FET standard;

(ii) the introduction of a Regulatory Lifespan of 20 years for the Wind Farms and 25
years for the CSP Plants;
(iii) the introduction of a cap of 2,040 annual operating hours for the CSP Plants;!!8°

(iv) the reduction of the cap on energy produced through Back-up Fuel that would
qualify for feed-in remuneration, to 15,000 thermal MWh;

(v) the abolishment of the supplement for reactive energy;

(vi) the introduction of the Operating Threshold and Minimum Operating Hours; and

1186 Tp relation to the Wind Farms, the reduction of the cap to 0 is inherent to the logic of the new remuneration system
(see {758 supra), which forms part of the measures that breach the FET standard.

914

915

916

917

(vii) the obligation for producers to contribute to the financing of a tariff deficit of up
to 2%, which contribution is subject to recovery with interest.

Moreover, as the Claimant has not established that the Disputed Measures changed the
tules on priority access/despatch for renewable energy producers, there is no basis for the
Tribunal to find any breach in this regard. Similarly, in respect of the quadrennial review
under RF3, the Tribunal finds that this mechanism as such does not constitute a breach of
the FET standard. While reviews conducted under this mechanism may result in such
breach, the Claimant has not challenged any such review in this arbitration and the Tribunal
does not, therefore, need to make any finding in this regard.''8’

Lack of Transparency and Due Process
The Claimant’s Principal Arguments

Relying in particular on the wording “transparent conditions for Investors” in Article 10(1)
ECT and on Electrabel v. Hungary,''®* the Claimant submits that the FET standard required
the Respondent to clarify which rights investors had and to inform them about any intended
changes in its policies and regulations that had the potential of significantly affecting
investments.''*? Moreover, the Claimant argues that the FET standard includes a guarantee
of due process, which may be violated not only by the host State’s courts but also by
executive and legislative decision-making that is lacking procedural fairness.''®? The
Claimant points out that ILC Article 2 provides that an internationally wrongful act can be
committed by omission, so that a lack of transparency or due process constitutes a breach
of the ECT.'!?!

According to the Claimant, the Respondent failed to meet the requirements of transparency
and due process when it adopted the Disputed Measures. The Claimant contends that the
CSP Plants and Wind Farms suffered from a “roller-coaster” of legislative changes that
created a situation of “absolute uncertainty” as to their rights.!!°*

In particular, the Claimant highlights that the Respondent passed RDL 2/2013 and
MO IET/221/2013 only to abrogate them — together with the entire RF1 —just a few months
later through RDL 9/2013. In addition, the Claimant submits that it took another year
before it was clear what the new regulatory framework was going to be, both in terms of
the economic regime and the procedure for becoming registered in the RRRE. Moreover,
the Claimant contends that the law-making process during that year was highly irregular,
featuring (i) a complete withdrawal of the initial draft of RD 413/2014 after it had received
severe criticism by the CNE, (ii) the submission of a slightly revised draft to the newly
created CNMC, which was widely known to be closer to the Respondent’s position, and

(iii) the Respondent’s behaviour in respect of the Consultant Reports, which came to be
known as the “report scandal” in the industry.!'%°

In addition, the Claimant contends that while Law 15/2012 stripped the CSP Plants as of
1 January 2013 of feed-in remuneration for electricity generated with Back-up Fuel, the
methodology that it referred to for establishing the effective amount of electricity
attributable to the use of Back-up Fuel was not enacted until 14 October 2014 (in MO
TET/1882/2014). According to the Claimant, this left the CSP Plants in complete
uncertainty for almost two years as to how much Back-up Fuel they were entitled to use
and required them to subsequently reimburse some of the feed-in remuneration
received,!!°4

Furthermore, the Claimant asserts that its rights are not even clear under RF3 because of
its being subject to revisions every 3 or 6 years.!!°5

The Respondent’s Principal Arguments

The Respondent denies the alleged “vices or errors” in its law-making and maintains that
it acted transparently, at the very least under the lenient standard developed in AES v.
Hungary.!!%°

In particular, the Respondent submits that the need for a reform of RF1 had been known
since at least 2009, based on the explanatory memorandums of RDL 6/2009, RD 1614/2010
and RDL 14/2010. Moreover, the Respondent refers to multiple public announcements that
were made by the Respondent between December 2011 and September 2012.!!°7

In addition, the Respondent contends that the delays in adopting RD 413/2014 were simply
due to the volume of observations received, meaning that they were actually a consequence
of transparency and of the participation of the affected sectors. With respect to the time
that it took to promulgate MO IET 1045/2014, the Respondent points out the complexity
of this piece of legislation, which comprises 1,761 pages and covers 1,967 different
installation types.!!°

Moreover, the Respondent argues that during the law-making process for RD 413/2014 and
MO TIET/1045/2014, all interested parties were timely informed and had the right to access
the relevant information, as required by Spanish legislation. The Respondent notes in
particular that Protermosolar, AEE and APPA participated actively in the process. In the
Respondent’s view, this disproves the Claimant’s assertion that its facilities were operating
in a regulatory limbo for almost two years.!!°?

The Respondent further contends that the contract with BCG was terminated due to failures
in the contract execution and that the Respondent never received their Consultant Report.
With respect to Roland Berger, the Respondent asserts that their Consultant Report was
received after the passing of both RD 413/2014 and MO IET/1045/2014 and merely served
as a technical support to IDAE, which had also carried out an analysis on its own.
Therefore, the Respondent argues that the Consultant Reports not being public prior to the
enactment of the foregoing pieces of legislation does not constitute a lack of transparency
because these reports were not determinative for the law-making. !?°°

Finally, the Respondent submits that contrary to the Claimant’s argument, the periodic
reviews every three and six years grant additional security and predictability to investors
because they are aimed at ensuring a reasonable rate of return.!?°'

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal agrees with the approach taken by other tribunals insofar as they considered
the aspects of transparency and due process relevant to deciding whether an investor was
accorded FET within the meaning of Article 10(1) ECT.!°? With respect to transparency,
this finds explicit support in the wording of Article 10(1) ECT, which requires the host
State to provide “transparent conditions” to investors.

However, on the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has
been unable to establish that a breach of the Article 10(1) ECT occurred on the basis of a
lack of transparency and due process.

The Tribunal notes that law-making processes and styles differ significantly not only
between different States but also over time within the same State. Also, the legislative
process lies at the core of a State’s sovereignty. For these reasons, it is not inappropriate
for a tribunal to apply its own views of what constitutes legislative “best practices’ as a
standard to determine whether a State’s law-making process was sufficiently transparent
and in line with due process in order not to breach Article 10(1) ECT. Instead, States must
be accorded a significant margin of appreciation in this regard and tribunals must limit
themselves to safeguarding the most fundamental notions of transparency and due process.
The Tribunal finds that this level of judicial scrutiny is consistent with the approach taken
in AES v. Hungary, where the tribunal found that the acceptable margin of law-making
processes included also practices that were sub-optimal.!?°> Applying this standard to the
present case, the Tribunal does not find it established that the Respondent violated such
fundamental notions of transparency and due process.

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that certain aspects of the law-making process were
far from ideal. In particular, there was a significant time of uncertainty after RDL 9/2013
abrogated the previous regulatory framework without spelling out the economic details of
the new system (providing instead for temporary application of the old economic regime,
subject to potential reimbursement of overpayments once the new regulatory regime was
devised). However, the Tribunal also considers that the Respondent’s explanation for the
delay in implementing the new regulatory regime justifies at least significant parts of that
delay. Moreover, given the soaring Tariff Deficit at the time, there is at least a reasonable
explanation for the Respondent’s decision not to wait with the abrogation of the old system
until all details of the new system were ready, but rather to enact right away the ground
tules of the new system (in the form of RDL 9/2013) and announce that the details would
follow in later pieces of legislation.!* In light thereof, while certainly not ideal, the
Tribunal does not consider that the Respondent’s course of action constituted a breach of
Article 10(1) ECT for lack of transparency or due process.

The same is true for the “report scandal” referred to by the Claimant. The Tribunal does
share the Claimant’s concerns regarding the Respondent’s explanations as to why reports
of BCG and Roland Berger were not published before the enactment of RD 413/2014 and
MO IET/1045/2014. However, the Tribunal does not consider that Article 10(1) ECT
necessarily requires States to make public all internal documents on which they relied in
drafting their legislation. Publishing any and all expert reports based on which the
economic parameters of RF3 were set would certainly have been preferable in this case,
not least to further the public confidence in the law-making process. However, the Tribunal
is not convinced that the Respondent’s failure to be more transparent in this regard is
sufficient, in and of itself, to constitute a breach of Article 10(1) ECT.

Similarly, as regards the periodic revisions of RF3 that may take place every 3 or 6 years
(depending on the parameters to be revised), the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that
this does introduce an element of uncertainty that goes beyond the periodic review
mechanism contained in RF1. However, it is also true that the legislator must be able to
react to changes of circumstances, in particular in a heavily regulated and subsidized
environment such as the energy sector. Moreover, Law 24/2013 does guarantee a
reasonable rate of profitability.!?°° While this guarantee is not spelled out in numeric terms
(beyond the first regulatory period!) and is therefore open to interpretation, it does limit
the Respondent’s ability to use the periodic reviews for changes that adversely affect
producers of renewable energy. Accordingly, producers of renewable energy could
challenge periodic reviews on that basis. Therefore, once again, while the Tribunal has
sympathy for the Claimant’s concerns, it does not find it established that there is a lack of
transparency or due process that reaches the level of breaching Article 10(1) ECT.

Finally, and in any case, even if a breach of Article 10(1) ECT had occurred for lack of
transparency or due process, the Claimant has failed to establish on the basis of evidence

For this reason, the Tribunal is unable to share the Claimant’s view that there was no “urgency” (being a

requirement under Spanish law for using the form of a Royal-Decree Law), as argued in MoM, 1417; RoM, (1379.
1205 Law 24/2013 (C-0378/R-0076), Article 14(4).

that it suffered any damage as a result of this particular alleged breach. Indeed, the Claimant
has not established that there is any specific damage that would not have arisen had the
Respondent enacted the very same RF3 but through a law-making process that met the
highest possible standards in terms of transparency and due process.!?°’ For this reason
alone, the Tribunal cannot entertain the Claimant’s claim insofar as it rests on the allegation
that the Respondent’s law-making was not sufficiently transparent and did not respect due
process.

Arbitrariness
The Claimant’s Principal Arguments

The Claimant submits that according to arbitral jurisprudence, in particular Electrabel v.
Hungary, the FET guarantee of Article 10(1) ECT encompasses also the prohibition of
arbitrariness.'7°° According to the Claimant, the consecutive changes to the regulatory
framework applicable to the CSP Plants and Wind Farms have produced a completely new
system, which represents a radical departure from the RF1 and which is totally
unprecedented and unique when compared to other models existing in the EU and
beyond.'2 The Claimant contends that these changes were unforeseeable and made the
Respondent dramatically less attractive for investors.'?!°

The Respondent’s Principal Arguments

The Respondent argues that arbitrariness is not an independent standard, but is instead
included in the third sentence of Article 10(1) ECT.!?!' In any case, the Respondent submits
that it pursued a rational policy in the public interest, and therefore did not act arbitrarily
under the standard of arbitrariness developed in Electrabel v. Hungary.'?!?

The Tribunal’s Analysis

Relying on Charanne v. Spain, the Claimant itself has noted the connection between the
protection of legitimate expectations and the question as to whether a State acted
arbitrarily.'?'> Indeed, much of the case-law relied on by the Claimant to support its claim
of arbitrariness was in fact related to the protection of legitimate expectations.''* Also, the
main thrust of the Claimant’s arbitrariness argument is that the legislative change were
radical and unforeseeable for investors.

The Claimant merely asserts that “[dJue to the overflow of changes and regulatory uncertainty, the Claimant

suffered substantial damages” (RoM, 41385), without however particularizing this alleged damage.

940

Against this background, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant’s claim of arbitrariness does
not add anything of substance to its claim that its legitimate expectations were violated by
the Respondent. This is unsurprising because legitimate expectations do not encompass
arbitrary behaviour on the part of the host State. Similarly, the Tribunal finds that the
Claimant’s claim of arbitrariness is difficult to distinguish from its claim that its investment
was impaired by unreasonable measures on the part of the Respondent.

Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant’s arguments as to alleged arbitrariness
are subsumed in the Tribunal’s analysis on whether the Respondent violated legitimate
expectations (see section 2. above) or the guarantee of non-impairment (see section C.
below).

Most Constant Protection and Security
The Claimant’s Principal Arguments

The Claimant submits that pursuant to arbitral jurisprudence, the ECT’s guarantee of “most
constant protection and security” (“MCPS”) is equivalent to the standard of full protection
and security as is commonly used in international investment treaties.'?!> According to the
Claimant, several arbitral tribunals have found this guarantee to require a host State not
only to secure the physical protection of the investors, but also to provide a secure legal
environment.'?'¢ Specifically, the Claimant argues that based on CSOB v. Slovakia, a host
State violates its obligation to provide full protection and security if it fails to live up to
commitments, assurances or promises that it made to the investor. !2!7

Moreover, relying on the MFN clause in Article 10(7) ECT, the Claimant invokes a number
of BITs entered into by the Respondent for the purposes of obtaining full protection and
security. The Claimant submits that if the Tribunal finds that the ECT’s MCPS does not
encompass legal security, the Respondent would need to grant legal security at least under
Article 10(7) ECT in conjunction with those BITs.!?!8

The Claimant asserts that the Respondent violated the MCPS standard by failing to provide
a secure and stable investment environment, instead implementing a series of legislative
changes that resulted in a regulatory limbo for significant periods of time and eliminated
paramount economic rights of the investors — all this despite numerous commitments,
assurances and promises through which the Respondent had guaranteed that the regulatory
framework for the Claimant’s facilities would remain stable and consistent over time.!?!°

The Claimant adds that even if one followed the test proposed by the Respondent, i.e. that
measures do not violate the guarantee of MCPS if they are reasonable in the circumstances
and are taken to a achieve a rational public policy goal, the Respondent would still have
breached the MCPS standard because the Disputed Measures fail to meet this test.!??°

The Respondent’s Principal Arguments

The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s arguments on this claim do not add anything
to its legitimate expectations case. Moreover, the Respondent claims that the MCPS
standard guarantees protection against third parties and has its origin in avoiding physical
attacks against investors. In addition, according to the Respondent, arbitral jurisprudence
and scholarly writing shows that the MCPS standard is not violated if a State exercises its
right to legislate, provided that it acts reasonably in the circumstances and with a view to
achieving objectively rational public policy goals.!??! Furthermore, the Respondent
highlights that the tribunal in Jsolux v. Spain found that the MCPS standard “cannot
intervene to protect the investor against modifications of the legal framework in cases that
do not justify such protection as a result of the obligation to ensure the FET” .'?>> The
Respondent argues that the MCPS standard does not guarantee stable legal conditions, or
else it would be superfluous besides the FET standard and the guarantee of non-
impairment.!?23

 

The Respondent contends that the Disputed Measures did not violate the MCPS standard
because they were a reasonable response to the social and economic circumstances, given
that they aimed at rebalancing the Tariff Deficit, stopping the rise of consumer electricity
tariffs and maintaining reasonable rates of return for producers of renewable energy. In this
regard, the Respondent also emphasizes that the RF3 Target IRR coincides which what
APPA had suggested in 2009.'274

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal concurs with the view taken by the tribunals in AES v. Hungary, Electrabel
v. Hungary and Isolux v. Spain that the MCPS standard in Article 10(1) ECT requires the
host State to use due diligence and take reasonable steps to protect investors against
harmful acts by third parties. !225 The Tribunal further finds that at its core, at least, this
guarantee is concerned with the investor’s physical security. It is undisputed that the
Respondent did not breach the MCPS standard in this regard.

948

The Tribunal does not rule out that (but does not need to decide whether) under certain
circumstances, the MCPS standard may require protection also against other forms of
harassment, be it at the hands of State organs or private persons. In any case, the Tribunal
does not consider that MCPS offers any additional protection against legislative change in
addition to the protection afforded by the FET standard, in particular the protection of the
investor’s legitimate expectations. The Tribunal finds this approach to be supported by AES
v. Hungary and Isolux v. Spain.'??° Moreover, while some tribunals seem to have
considered that actions other than failure to protect the investor’s physical integrity could
violate the comparable standard of full protection and security under other investment
treaties, it seems that those tribunals routinely reached the same result as under the FET
standard.'22’ This confirms the Tribunal’s view that, in case of the ECT, MCPS does not
provide additional protection against legislative change as compared to FET.

This being so, and given that the Claimant’s MCPS claim relies on the very same acts of
the Respondent as the FET claim, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to analyse whether
the guarantee of MCPS was breached by way of an unstable legal environment created by
the Respondent. Even if MCPS covers such actions of the host State, the Tribunal’s
conclusion could not be any different than its conclusions on the Claimant’ FET claim.

Non-impairment
The Claimant’s Principal Arguments

The Claimant submits that Article 10(1) ECT is breached if the host State impairs
investments by measures that are either unreasonable or discriminatory, i.e. it is not
necessary that the host State’s actions meet both of these criteria cumulatively.!?7° In the
Claimant’s view, at least for the discrimination criterion, the burden of proof is on the
Respondent, i.e. the Respondent must prove that no discrimination took place.!?”?

Relying on BG v. Argentina, the Claimant argues that a measure fails to meet the standard
of reasonableness not only if it is unreasonable from an objective viewpoint, but also if it
fails to live up to the subjective expectation of the parties involved in the dispute, in
particular if the host State withdraws assurances given to investors to induce them to
invest.'° According to the Claimant, the Disputed Measures were subjectively
unreasonable'?*! because they thwarted the Claimant’s legitimate expectation that the
regulatory framework would remain stable and consistent over time, given the
commitments, promises and assurances made by the Respondent. In particular, the
Claimant argues that the Respondent changed the focus of the remuneration parameters

(from production to power capacity) and fixed a target rate of return without regard to the
Claimant’s earlier investment decision, its financial base case and the rate of return
considered back then, in specific reliance of RF1.'2°2 The Claimant asserts that the
Respondent cannot use the Tariff Deficit as a justification as it was created by the
Respondent itself.'2** Moreover, the Claimant denies the Respondent’s contention that the
reasonableness of RF3 is shown by a renewable energy boom in Spain since 2015.
According to the Claimant, the investments referred to by the Respondent are actually
divestments because aggrieved investors left the country and sold their assets at prices close
to zero. Also, the fact that new projects may be planned under RF3 does not mean that RF3
is reasonable for projects that were financed and realized under RF1.!?**

As to the discriminatory nature of a measure, the Claimant submits that in accordance with
arbitral case law, a measure is discriminatory if (i) the group of investors that must be taken
into account for the purposes of comparison is in similar circumstances to those of the
investor in question, (ii) a different treatment has been given to the investor in question by
the host State than to the group of comparable investors, and (iii) such a different treatment
is not reasonably justified.'?*° The Claimant asserts that its CSP Plants were discriminated
against compared to other renewable energies because Law 15/2012 suppressed the right
to receive feed-in remuneration for the production of energy attributable to Back-up Fuel.
In the Claimant’s view, there was no reasonable justification for this discrimination given
that the CSP Plants were technically designed to use Back-up Fuel and had the right to
benefit from the specific guarantees set out in the 2010 CSP Agreement and the Waiver
Acceptance Resolutions. Moreover, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent unfairly
delayed the approval of MO IET/1882/2014 and thereby forced the CSP Plants to produce
energy without knowing how much energy produced with Back-up Fuel would be accepted
as being used for essential technical purposes and, thus, remunerated on top of pool
prices.!25°

The Claimant asserts that even if one applied the legal tests suggested by the Respondent
to determine whether the Disputed Measures were unreasonable or discriminatory, the
result would be the same. In particular, the Claimant argues that the RF3 Target IRR is
unreasonable, that the Disputed Measures were not suitable to avoid increases in consumer
tariffs, and that there was no justification for discriminating against the CSP and wind
subsectors when trying to reduce the Tariff Deficit.!"” Moreover, the Claimant asserts that
the Disputed Measures were not a logical response to the tariff deficit, in particular because

other avenues than cutting the remuneration of renewable energies were available to but
not taken by the Respondent!

Finally, the Claimant contends that as per arbitral jurisprudence, legislative change
reducing the income received for energy production qualifies as an impairment for the
purposes of Article 10(1) ECT.'?*? The Claimant argues that contrary to the Respondent’s
view, the decision in Jsolux v. Spain, in which the tribunal found that there was no
impairment because there was no negative impact on the investment, is of little relevance
because the facts and circumstances were different.!?4°

The Respondent’s Principal Arguments

Relying on Electrabel v. Hungary, the Respondent submits that the burden is on the
Claimant to prove impairment by unreasonable or discriminatory measures.'*4!

The Respondent argues that this standard of protection is related to the FET standard and
that the test established in AES v. Hungary serves to determine whether a State’s measures
are reasonable.'*4? According to the Respondent, the same facts that allow for the
conclusion that the Disputed Measures did not breach the FET standard also show that the
Disputed Measures cannot be considered unreasonable or discriminatory.!7# In particular,
the Respondent refers to the socioeconomic circumstances that urgently required
legislative change in 2013.'*4 The Respondent asserts that the Disputed Measures aimed
at protecting consumers and the sustainability of the SES while avoiding over-
remuneration, all of which the tribunal in AES v. Hungary (and the Ad Hoc Committee in
the same case) considered to be perfectly valid and rational policy objectives.!?4> The
Respondent further argues that there was an appropriate correlation between these
objectives and the Disputed Measures as they involved all members of the SES and also
taxpayers, and because the RF3 Target IRR is reasonable and coincides with what APPA
had expressly proposed in 2009.'4° Moreover, the Respondent alleges that RF3 has been
positively received by the EC, the International Monetary Fund, the International Energy
Agency and domestic and international investors, resulting in a renewable energies boom
in 2015 with more than 5 billion euros in investment. !247

The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s reliance on BG v. Argentina is misplaced
because in that case, the host State contractually agreed not to modify certain licenses
granted without the consent of the licensor.'**

With respect to discrimination, the Respondent argues that the applicable test is the one set
out in EDF v. Romania, i.e. whether the measure in question (i) inflicts damage on the
investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose, (ii) is not based on legal
standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference, (iii) is taken for reasons that
are different from those put forward or (iv) is taken in wilful disregard of due process and
proper procedure.'”4? The Respondent submits that none of these criteria is met as the
Disputed Measures serve to rebalance the then unsustainable electricity system (as
explained in the legislative materials), preserve the principle of reasonable return, apply to
any domestic or international investors alike, and have been adopted pursuant to the legally
established procedures and following extensive consultation with interested parties.!?°°

In addition, the Respondent denies that the Disputed Measures were discriminatory even if
one applied the test suggested by the Claimant. First, the Respondent asserts that when
comparing different subsectors in the renewable energy sector, one cannot look in isolation
at the measures adopted in 2013 because with respect to the wind and photovoltaic sectors,
measures reducing their remuneration had already been passed in 2007 and 2010.
Secondly, the Respondent argues that the Claimant failed to establish that there was any
different treatment, given that the Disputed Measures affected all producers of renewable
energy without distinction. Thirdly, the Respondent contends that the Tariff Deficit and
over-remuneration of renewable energy producers justified the measures taken.!7>!

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the non-impairment standard of Article 10(1)
ECT is breached if the Disputed Measures are either unreasonable or discriminatory and
result in an impairment of the investment.

With respect to the burden of proof, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that it is for
the Claimant to establish such breach. This applies also to the assertion of discriminatory
measures. In this regard, the Tribunal is unable to follow the approach apparently taken in
Nykomb v. Latvia, as relied on by the Claimant, whereby the host State bears the burden of
proving that no discrimination took place. Apart from the fact that the proof of a negative
is a difficult concept, the Tribunal sees no reason to depart from the generally accepted rule
under international law that each party bears the burden of proving the requirements of its
claim (or defence), !7°? This does not exclude, of course, that if the investor established that

it was treated differently from comparable investors and if there is no justification apparent
for such discrimination from the investor’s pleadings, it will be for the host State to submit
in defence any facts that may justify the different treatment.

Turning first to the Claimant’s allegation that the Disputed Measures are unreasonable, the
Tribunal notes that apart from the TVPEE and the TEE, over both of which the Tribunal
does not have jurisdiction, the Claimant asserts only subjective unreasonableness. The
Tribunal further notes that according to the Claimant, this subjective unreasonableness
stems from a frustration of its legitimate expectation that the regulatory framework would
remain stable and consistent. In other words, this part of the Claimant’s non-impairment
claim is identical in substance with the Claimant’s legitimate expectations case. Therefore,
the Tribunal considers that this aspect of the non-impairment claim is subsumed in the
analysis in section VII.A.2 above, and does not require additional analysis here.

With respect to the question as to whether the Disputed Measures are discriminatory, the
Tribunal notes that beyond the TVPEE and the TEE, the Claimant asserts discrimination
solely in respect of those Disputed Measures that concerned the CSP Plants’ right to receive
feed-in remuneration for energy produced through the burning of Back-up Fuel. While the
Tribunal endorses the three-prong test submitted by the Claimant to determine whether a
measure is discriminatory in the sense of the non-impairment standard in Article 10(1)
ECT, the Tribunal does not accept the Claimant’s application of this test to the facts of this
case.

First, the Tribunal finds it difficult to accept the Claimant’s assertion that it was treated
differently from comparable investors. Contrary to the Claimant, the Tribunal doubts that
the CSP projects are comparable to other renewable energy projects when it comes to
evaluating the Respondent’s decision to reduce the maximum amount of Back-up Fuel for
which CSP plants could receive feed-in remuneration. After all, the need to burn Back-up
Fuel for technical purposes is a special characteristic of CSP facilities that differentiate
them from other renewable technologies. The Claimant has not referred the Tribunal to any
other types of renewable energy technologies that likewise burn Back-up Fuel for technical
purposes and that were treated differently from the CSP Plants when it came to the
Disputed Measures’ impact on the feed-in remuneration receivable for Back-up Fuel.

Secondly, and in any event, even if one were to compare CSP plants to other renewables
that do not even use Back-up Fuel, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent provided a
reasonable justification for the change brought about by RF2. As already explained
above,!2> the CSP Plants never had any right, i.e. not even under RF1, to receive feed-in
remuneration for non-technical use of Back-up Fuel. The Respondent has submitted and
the Claimant has not disputed that experience showed that the 12 or 15% caps applicable
under RFI went far beyond the amount of Back-up Fuel actually needed for technical
purposes. Also, the Claimant has not claimed that the amount of Back-up Fuel that benefits
from feed-in remuneration under RF3 is lower than what is required for technical purposes.

0210/RL-0089), 158; Saipem S.p.A. v. People’s Republic of Bangladesh, (CSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Decision on
Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures, 21 March 2007 (CL-0213/RL-01 13), (83.
253 See 4I763F. supra.

235

Therefore, even if one considered that the CSP plants were treated differently from other
renewables because only CSP plants were subject to this particular legislative change, the
Tribunal finds this different treatment to be justified: only for CSP plants, the previous
maximum amount of Back-up Fuel went beyond what was needed for technical purposes.
Therefore, it was reasonable to make this adjustment for CSP Plants alone.

963 Thirdly, for essentially the same reason, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant’s investment
was not impaired by the alleged discrimination. As mentioned, both under RF1 and RF3,
the Respondent is entitled to feed-in remuneration only in respect of Back-up Fuel used for
technical purposes, and there is no showing that the reduced maximum amount of Back-up
Fuel in RF3 is insufficient and therefore undermines the exercise of this right.

964 For these reasons, the Tribunal does not find the Disputed Measures to discriminate against
the Claimant. To the extent that subjective unreasonableness is asserted based on the
violation of legitimate expectations, the Tribunal refers to its findings in relation to the FET
standard.

D. Umbrella Clause
1. The Claimant’s Principal Arguments

965 Relying on arbitral jurisprudence and doctrine both in an ECT context and beyond, the
Claimant argues that the umbrella clause in the fourth sentence of Article 10(1) ECT refers
to obligations of any nature, including contractual and statutory.!7** Moreover, based in
particular on the findings of the International Court of Justice, respectively its predecessor,
in the Nuclear Tests and Mavrommatis cases, the Claimant submits that official statements
made by State agents may create obligations within the meaning of the ECT’s umbrella
clause.'~

966 As regards contractual obligations, the Claimant relies on Amto v. Ukraine to argue that the
ECT’s umbrella clause covers also obligations entered into by the host State vis-a-vis
subsidiary companies of the investors established in the host State.!*°° The Claimant asserts
that the Waiver Letters and Waiver Acceptance Resolutions fulfilled all requirements of a
“declaratory contract” under Spanish law, by which the Respondent entered into a binding
commitment towards the CSP SPVs not to change the remuneration offered by RF1. In this
regard, the Claimant also submits that had the Waiver Acceptance Resolutions been mere

administrative acts, as claimed by the Respondent, it could not be explained why the
Respondent and Protermosolar had exchanged drafts of the Waiver Letters and Waiver
Acceptance Resolutions and agreed in the CSP Agreement that these documents would be
exchanged between the Respondent and individual CSP plants.'?°7

Regarding statutory obligations falling under the umbrella clause in this case, the Claimant
relies in particular on LG&E v. Argentina'* and contends that Law 54/1997, RD
2818/1998, RD 436/2004, RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010 (in combination also with
administrative acts such as the registration of the Claimant’s facilities in RAIPRE)
contained unilateral commitments addressed to the renewably energy sector for the
purposes of attracting investments therein. In particular, the Claimant highlights the rights
granted to the Wind Farms and CSP Plants under RD 661/2007, as well as Articles 4 and
5 of RD 1614/2010, which according to the Claimant protected existing facilities against
changes of the remunerative regime.'??

With respect to official statements made by the Respondent, the Claimant invokes the
official press releases accompanying RD 661/2007, the 2010 Agreements and
RD 1614/2010, as well as certain public statements made by the Respondent’s Minister of
Energy, Minister of Industry and Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Claimant asserts that all
of the foregoing reflected the idea that RF1 was endorsed by the Respondent and would
not be changed for qualifying CSP plants and wind farms.!?°°

The Claimant asserts that by adopting the Disputed Measures, the Respondent failed to
meet the aforementioned obligations to keep RFI intact and, therefore, breached the
umbrella clause.'?°! In addition, via the MFN clause included in Article 10(7) ECT, the
Claimant also relies on umbrella clauses contained in BITs entered into by the Respondent,
claiming that those clauses too were breached by the Disputed Measures. !?°

The Respondent’s Principal Arguments

The Respondent submits that in view of the wording “entered into” in the ECT’s umbrella
clause, it only applies to contractual obligations assumed by the host State with respect to
a specific investor or specific investment. According to the Respondent, this is confirmed
by arbitral jurisprudence, doctrine and the ECT Reader’s Guide.'? In addition, the
Respondent claims that none of the case-law and scholarly writing invoked by the Claimant
support its theory that laws of general application such as RF1, related press releases or

other public statements by officials of the host State fall under the ECT’s umbrella
clause. 26+

In addition, referring to its submissions on the Claimant’s legitimate expectation claim, the
Respondent argues that none of the legislative provisions or public statements invoked by
the Claimant contained any specific commitments not to change RF1.!7°> Moreover, the
Respondent asserts that the Claimant failed to establish that it relied on any such public
statements when making the investment.!7° Also, with respect to the 2010 Agreements,
the Respondent notes that AEE and Protermosolar, as alleged parties to the 2010 CSP
Agreement, never invoked any “agreement” on petrifying a specific remuneration regime,
and neither did the Claimant prior to this arbitration.'?67

Similarly, as to the Waiver Letters and Waiver Acceptance Resolutions, the Respondent
disputes that they created a declaratory contract, and asserts that the Claimant’s argument
in this regard is a mere invention for this arbitration. The Respondent submits that neither
the Claimant nor its subsidiaries nor Mr. Gémez ever invoked such a contract prior to this
arbitration. The Respondent adds that Protermosolar as well as the Claimant’s partner in
Tberedlica Solar, Aprovechamientos Energéticos (in its claim against the Disputed
Measures before the Spanish Supreme Court) never argued the existence of any declaratory
contract either. The Respondent submits that the Waiver Acceptance Resolutions are
administrative acts and that their non-contractual nature is clear already from their title,
which speaks of a “Resolution” and a “Communication”, and from their text, which reads
“It is hereby decided that [...]”. The Respondent argues that the notice of the right to appeal
further confirms the legal nature as administrative act. Moreover, the Respondent notes
that none of the three elements required under Spanish law for a contract (consent, object
and cause) is present in the exchange of the Waiver Letters and the Waiver Acceptance
Resolutions. In any case, the Respondent highlights that in respect of the remuneration
values, the Waiver Acceptance Resolutions merely communicated the remuneration
applicable at the time, without making any statement that could be read as a commitment
not to change the remuneration in the future. According to the Respondent, this mere
communication of remuneration values was not even an administrative act in the legal
sense and therefore lacked any binding force under Spanish law, in accordance with
Spanish jurisprudence and doctrine. Finally, the Respondent submits that even if any
obligations falling under the umbrella clause had existed in respect of RFI, such
obligations would have been exclusively between the Respondent and the CSP SPVs,
rather than the Claimant.' In support of its arguments, the Respondent submitted a legal
opinion by two professors for Spanish administrative and civil law, who opined that the
Waiver Letters and Waiver Acceptance Resolutions are not contracts under Spanish
law.'

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The fourth sentence of Article 10(1) ECT provides as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an
Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.

The Tribunal notes that the above wording is very wide. In particular, the term “any
obligations” does not suggest any limitation as to the source of such obligation. While the
Tribunal accepts that the term “entered into” would usually be used more in the context of
bilateral or multilateral instruments, the Tribunal is not convinced that this wording
precludes, in and of itself, that commitments may be “entered into” unilaterally by a host
State, at least in case of unilateral commitments made specifically vis-a-vis individual
investors.!?”°

That said, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to make a definitive finding on this issue
because, in any case, the Tribunal does not find it established that any of the legislation,
documents or statements invoked by the Claimant created any obligations falling under the
ECT’s umbrella clause.

In relation to RF1 itself as well as related press releases and certain presentations, the
Tribunal has already found in the context of the Claimant’s legitimate expectation claim
that none of them could be understood as a specific commitment not to change RFI or the
tariff levels applicable at the time the Claimant invested.!?7!

Moreover, the Tribunal does not consider that the 2010 Agreements gave rise to any
contractual obligations of the Respondent, be it vis-a-vis the Claimant or any of its
subsidiaries through which the investment was made.'?”? First, the Tribunal notes that
neither the Claimant nor the SPVs were parties to the 2010 Agreements (for the avoidance
of doubt, the Claimant has not established that AEE or Protermosolar had any authority to
act on behalf of the Claimant or any of the SPVs). Secondly, the Tribunal finds that the
2010 Agreements cannot be isolated from their context, which was a consultation of the
industries affected by the intended amendments to the regulatory framework. In the
Tribunal’s view, the outcome of those consultations, as reflected in the 2010 Agreements,
was not contractual in nature. Rather, the Tribunal considers that the 2010 Agreements
were political documents. The Tribunal is not convinced that the intention was for them to
create any legally binding and enforceable obligations of the Respondent vis-a-vis the trade
associations with whom the 2010 Agreements were concluded.

Equally, the Tribunal finds that no such commitments were made in any of the other public
statements that the Claimant invokes in the context of its umbrella clause claim. This holds
true in particular for statements allegedly made by officials of the Respondent at the
inauguration of the Wind Farms (by the then Minister of Industry), at roadshows (by the

then Minister of Energy) or “ribbon-cutting ceremonies” for other renewable energy
projects (by the then Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Energy).'?”* Except for one quote
from the then Minister of Energy that does not in fact include any statements on RFI or its
stability,!?”* the Claimant did not explain which statements specifically it considers to have
created obligations within the meaning of the umbrella clause. Having nonetheless
carefully reviewed all of the documents referred to by the Claimant in this regard,!?”> the
Tribunal finds that some of them do not even contain any statements on RF] at all. To the
extent that RF1 is referred or at least alluded to, there are no statements on the stability or
future evolution of the regulatory framework, much less statements that could be regarded
as creating an obligation in the sense of the ECT’s umbrella clause. Similarly, the mere
fact that the then Minister of Energy and the then Secretary of State for Energy “visited
USA in 2009 for the purposes of attracting investors”'?"° or that the then King of Spain
attended an inauguration ceremony'”’ is not a sufficient basis for creating legally binding
obligations protected by the ECT’s umbrella clause.

979 Finally, with respect to the Waiver Acceptance Resolutions, the Tribunal has already found
that based on their plain language, they merely confirmed the remuneration levels
applicable at the time the Waiver Acceptance Resolutions were issued, without making any
statements on the stability of such remuneration levels. For this reason alone, these
documents could not give rise to an obligation not to change RF1. In addition, the Tribunal
does not find it established that, under Spanish law, the Waiver Letters and Waiver
Acceptance Resolutions created a contract, as asserted by the Claimant. The Tribunal finds
the arguments of the Respondent in this regard convincing, which were supported by the
legal opinion of the Respondent’s legal experts. The Tribunal notes that the Claimant, who
bears the burden of proof in this regard, did not proffer any expert evidence to support its
contrary position.

980 Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimant’s claim under the fourth sentence of
Article 10(1) ECT. The Tribunal notes that to its knowledge, no tribunal thus far has found
any of the Disputed Measures to be in breach the ECT’s umbrella clause.!2”*

Unlawful Expropriation
The Claimant’s Principal Arguments

The Claimant argues that RF2 and RF3 amount to an indirect expropriation of its
investment under Article 13 ECT.!2” According to the Claimant, the market value of its
investment has decreased by 94% on average, diminishing its value to nearly zero. The
Claimant contends that it is unable to manage the investment and is unable to obtain any
profit from it. Therefore, the Claimant claims that it has been deprived of all significant
economic value of its investment. !?°°

The Claimant further contends that, in terms of Article 13 ECT, the expropriation was
unlawful because it has not been compensated and was not carried out under due process
of law. 18

It is the Claimant’s position that RF2 and RF3 amounted to a creeping indirect de facto
expropriation. The Claimant acknowledges that it retained its property in the shares that
constitute its investment. However, the value of its indirect stakes in the companies owning
the CSP Plants and Wind Farms has been destroyed, creating a situation tantamount to an
expropriation. '28?

The Claimant recognizes that severity, or the extent of the economic impact, is the decisive
criterion for the existence of a measure tantamount to an expropriation. This requirement
of a ‘substantial deprivation’ manifests itself in the neutralization of all significant
economic value of the investment and in the destruction of the ability to manage the
investment.'?*> The value loss in equity and shareholder loans interests of 90% qualifies as
a permanent ‘substantial deprivation’ for the purposes of the determination of an indirect
expropriation under Article 13(1) ECT.'?8+ Moreover, the refinancing process of the
companies prevents the distribution of any dividends. '?%°

The Claimant argues that the Tribunal should consider the Respondent’s adverse measures
in aggregate as a composite act.!*®° The Claimant complains that, as a consequence of
Respondent’s measures, the management of the investment has become almost impossible
since it has to concentrate its efforts on “pure survival activity” dealing with the lenders to
avoid default and with urgent efforts to avoid the collapse of the affected companies.!?°7 In

addition, Iberedlica Solar’s management has been curtailed by an “insolvency
manager” |?88

The Claimant points out that it has made an investment that is capable of being
expropriated. Its investment consists of shares and returns. These are capable of being
expropriated. Its indirectly expropriated investments are share capital and subordinated
debt,!28

The Claimant denies that Spain has merely taken regulatory government measures that
would rule out a compensable expropriation. The Disputed Measures are discriminatory
towards the renewables sector, inflict disproportionate damage upon CSP and wind farms
and did not comply with due process of law.'?°”

The Respondent’s Principal Arguments

The Respondent denies the existence of an indirect expropriation. The rights alleged by the
Claimant do not constitute property that would be subject to expropriation. The Claimants
did not own possible future returns resulting from hoped for subsidies. The premiums on
tariffs were mere expectations that were not part of the investor’s patrimony. The Claimant
did not have a title or acquired right to these benefits.!7°! Nor did the Claimant have a right
to administer and manage the CSP Plants and Wind Farms.'? The Claimant’s investment
consists of shares and credits/loans. Therefore, the Claimant had, at most, the expectation
of receiving dividends and of supervising the management. It is the Respondent’s position
that neither the shares nor the subordinated debt has been expropriated. Nor have the
invoked powers of administration and enjoyment been expropriated.!?°>

In addition, the Respondent points out that the Disputed Measures were regulatory
measures taken in the State’s normal exercise of its “police powers” and were hence not
subject to compensation. The contested measures are proportionate and in the public
interest. The public interest pursued was to prevent the collapse of the SES. In the
Respondent’s view, the measures adopted by Spain were regulatory and non-
discriminatory, performed bona fide, with the purpose to protect public interests in a
proportional way and taken in compliance with due process.'?°*

The Respondent denies the existence of a substantial deprivation. An indirect expropriation
would be absent when investors have maintained control over the whole investment.
Adverse effects would not be enough. A substantial deprivation requires loss of control
over the investment or the elimination of its economic value. The Claimant’s facilities were
still in operation and under the control and management of their owners receiving a

reasonable return.'?°° The Claimant continues to maintain control and ownership of the
shares and subordinated debt.!2° The fact that the Claimant had to focus its efforts on
dealing with lenders and restructuring shows that it still exercises managerial control over
the companies.!?°”

In the Respondent’s view, any substantial deprivation would stop the operation or would
imply a taking of control or permanently destroy the investment’s value. The regulatory
measures taken by the Respondent are neither permanent nor irreversible. Moreover, the
measures did not amount to a transfer of assets to the Respondent or to a private entity.!?°
Therefore, there is neither a substantial deprivation nor an interference with the possibility
of management nor are the measures non-modifiable.!7°

The Tribunal’s Analysis

Both Parties rely on Article 13 of the Energy Charter Treaty which provides:
ARTICLE 13
EXPROPRIATION
(1) Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other Contracting Party
shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to a measure or measures having effect
equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as ‘Expropriation’) except
where such Expropriation is:
(a) for a purpose which is in the public interest;
(b) not discriminatory;
(c) carried out under due process of law; and
(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.
Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the Investment expropriated at the
time immediately before the Expropriation or impending Expropriation became known in such
a way as to affect the value of the Investment (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Valuation Date’).
Such fair market value shall at the request of the Investor be expressed in a Freely Convertible
Currency on the basis of the market rate of exchange existing for that currency on the Valuation

Date. Compensation shall also include interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis
from the date of Expropriation until the date of payment.

 

 

(2) The Investor affected shall have a right to prompt review, under the law of the Contracting
Party making the Expropriation, by a judicial or other competent and independent authority of

that Contracting Party, of its case, of the valuation of its Investment, and of the payment of
compensation, in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph (1).

  

(3) For the avoidance of doubt, Expropriation shall include situations where a Contracting Party
expropriates the assets of a company or enterprise in its Area in which an Investor of any other
Contracting Party has an Investment, including through the ownership of shares.

 

993 The Parties agree that the Claimant’s investment consists of shares and loans. The Parties
also agree that the test for an indirect expropriation is the existence of a substantial
deprivation.

994 The criterion of substantial deprivation addresses the intensity or severity of the economic
impact of the disputed measures. This severity may manifest itself in a loss of control over
the investment or a substantial, i.e. total or near total, loss of its value. In this way, an
indirect expropriation may occur even though formal ownership has not been affected.

995 In Metalclad v. Mexico, the tribunal, applying Article 1110 of the NAFTA, described an
indirect expropriation as follows:

103. Thus, expropriation under NAFTA includes not only open, deliberate and acknowledged
takings of property, such as outright seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in favour of
the host State, but also covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the
effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-
expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host
State.30°

996 In Tecmed v. Mexico the tribunal described the intensity of the interference in terms of a
‘radical deprivation’:

it must be first determined if the Claimant, due to the Resolution, was radically deprived of the
economical use and enjoyment of its investments, as if the rights related thereto — such as the
income or benefits related to the Landfill or to its exploitation — had ceased to exist. In other
words, if due to the actions of the Respondent, the assets involved have lost their value or
economic use for their holder and the extent of the loss.!*°!

 

997 In Starrett Housing v. Iran, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal described an indirect
expropriation in the following terms:

it is recognized in international law that measures taken by a State can interfere with property
rights to such an extent that these rights are rendered so useless that they must be deemed to
have been expropriated, even though the State does not purport to have expropriated them and
the legal title to the property formally remains with the original owner.'*°?

In that case, as well as in other cases decided by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal,!3
the appointment of managers by the government and the actions of these managers were
seen as amounting to an indirect expropriation.

In CMS v. Argentina, the tribunal found that the essential issue was “to establish whether
the enjoyment of the property has been effectively neutralized.”'*™ The tribunal found that
this was not the case since:

the investor is in control of the investment; the Government does not manage the day-to-day
operations of the company; and the investor has full ownership and control of the investment.'°°5

As far as loss of value is concerned, tribunals have found that only a total or near total and
permanent deprivation amounted to an indirect expropriation. In AES v. Hungary, the
tribunal said:

It is evident that many state’s acts or measures can affect investments and a modification to an
existing law or regulation is probably one of the most common of such acts or measures.
Nevertheless, a state’s act that has a negative effect on an investment cannot automatically be
considered an expropriation. For an expropriation to occur, it is necessary for the investor to be
deprived, in whole or significant part, of the property in or effective control of its investment:
or for its investment to be deprived, in whole or significant part, of its value.!3°

The tribunal in Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela went one step further and required a total
loss of value:

The Tribunal considers that, under international law, a measure which does not have all the
features of a formal expropriation may be equivalent to an expropriation if it gives rise to an
effective deprivation of the investment as a whole. Such a deprivation requires either a total lo:
of the investment’s value or a total loss of control by the investor of its investment, both of a
permanent nature. "7

 

 

In the present case, the Claimant confirms that it retained ownership in the shares that
constituted the investment. Its inability to manage the investment is said to derive from the
need to give an inordinate amount of attention to “survival activity”. However, as the
Respondent points out correctly, the plants were still in operation and under the control and
management of their original owners. The Claimant continued to maintain control and
ownership of the shares and subordinated debt.

Accuracy’s second expert report calculates an actual project return for the CSP plants of
7.1% pre-tax, which is higher than the cost of capital. The same Report calculates an
average project return of 10.4% for the wind farms, which is also higher than the cost of
capital. Therefore, on the Respondent’s case, the CSP Plants and the Wind Farms were

obtaining a reasonable return.'*° Brattle’s first regulatory expert report shows a
substantially reduced cash flow available for distribution to equity investors as a
consequence of the disputed measures. It does, however, indicate that even under RF3 there
was still space for some revenue for the shareholders.'*° This conclusion is reinforced by
the Joint Model.

1004 Under these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the element of substantial deprivation is
missing. The Disputed Measures had a negative economic effect upon the Claimant’s
investment but that is not sufficient for a finding of indirect expropriation. There was no
substantial or radical deprivation or effective neutralization of the investment. The losses
suffered by Claimant are more appropriately analysed under the rubric of FET. They do
not, however, lend themselves to a finding of indirect expropriation.

1005 Since the Tribunal holds that there is no indirect expropriation, it need not enter into the
discussion between the Parties on whether the measures met the requirements for a lawful
expropriation. Nor does it need to address the question whether the allegedly expropriatory
measures were justified as legitimate regulation.

1006 Decisions in other cases dealing with Spain’s measures in the renewables sector confirm
the conclusion reached by this Tribunal. In the majority of cases, a claim of expropriation
was either not raised or dropped.'?!° In Charanne v. Spain, the claimants contended that
RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010 amounted to an expropriation. The tribunal rejected this
argument and said:

461. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with many arbitral tribunals which have considered that the
indirect expropriation standard under international law entails a substantial impact on the
investor’s property rights. Such impact can occur in the event of an effective deprivation of all
or part of the assets subject to the investment, or in the event of a loss of value that could be
equivalent to a deprivation of the investment due to its magnitude.

 

462. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is undisputed that the Claimants still own their shares in
T-Solar. There have neither been any allegations that their rights as T-Solar’s shareholders have
been limited or affected in any way by the measures disputed in this arbitration. Finally, is also
undisputed that the company Grupo T-Solar is still operating and producing profits, and it has
not been submitted that the company has been deprived of all or part of its assets, although the
disputed measures could have affected the company’s profitability.!3"!

 
  

1007 In Jsolux v. Spain, the claimant argued that the measures adopted by Spain had the effect
of an expropriation because they resulted in the investment’s substantial deprivation.!?!”
The tribunal rejected this argument and said:

the position adopted [...] by various international arbitral tribunals in this regard, is very clear
and demonstrates the common conviction that the unlawful direct or indirect expropriation may

affect both the investment and its control, and the affect must be substantial. That is to say, the
impact to the rights or goods of the investor of the measures, must be of such magnitude that its
investment loses all or a significant part of its value, which amounts to a deprivation of its
property.!39

In Novenergia v. Spain, the claimant contended that Spain’s measures in eliminating the
Special Regime and the imposition of a tax on renewable energy producers, had an effect
tantamount to the expropriation of its investment.'*'* The tribunal rejected the
expropriation claim and said:

Although the said acts had the effect of seriously affecting the Claimant’s investment and of
entitling the Claimant to proper compensation, they have nevertheless left unaffected the
Claimant’s proprietary rights. [...] the Claimant is still the ‘untouched’ owner of its plants and
is still the holder (direct or indirect) of the companies’ shares and relevant capital. While the
value of these assets diminished as an effect of the state measures which proved to be
incompatible with the FET obligation, the assets as such were not expropriated nor affected by
measures having an effect equivalent to an expropriation.!3!5

 

  
   

In Foresight/Greentech v. Spain, the claimants argued that 83% of the value of their equity
investment in the companies that owned the PV facilities had been destroyed as a result of
the disputed measures. This, they contended, amounted to a substantial deprivation and
thus constituted an expropriation of their investment.'*!° The tribunal rejected the claim
based on expropriation and said:

 
 

The Majority of the Tribunal accepts that the Claimants have suffered serious financial losses
as a result of the disputed measures. But this is not enough to sustain an expropriation claim.
[...] In the Tribunal’s view, the disputed measures did not substantially deprive the Claimants’
of the value, use or enjoyment of their investment. Accordingly, the Claimants’ claim under
Article 13 ECT is dismissed.!3!”

 

 

In 9REN v. Spain, the claimant argued that Spain, by way of RF3, had substantially
interfered with the claimant’s right to receive the full value of the RD 661/2007 and RD
1578/2008 tariffs and had, therefore, expropriated the claimant’s investments.'?!8 The
tribunal denied the existence of an expropriation:

While regulatory modifications between 2010 and 2014 significantly reduced the share value,
the reduction in value is better analyzed in terms of a violation of the Claimant’s legitimate
expectation. [...] [Spain] has reduced the value of the Claimant’s shares, but the income stream
still represents a return in the order of 7.9% [...] In the circumstances, the Tribunal rejects the
Claimant’s allegation that its investment was expropriated.'*!?

Conclusion on Responsibility

In summary, the Tribunal finds (by majority, with Arbitrator Sands dissenting) that the
Respondent breached the FET standard in Article 10(1) ECT by violating the Claimant’s
legitimate expectation of Relative Stability. In relation to the other breaches of the ECT
alleged by the Claimant, they were either not established or do not add anything to the
breach of the FET standard.

DAMAGES
The Claimant’s Principal Arguments

The Claimant submits that while the ECT provides, in Article 13(1), the standard of
compensation for a lawful expropriation, it does not provide a standard of compensation
for any of the breaches of the ECT asserted by the Claimant. Therefore, the Claimant argues
that based on customary international law, as reflected in ILC Articles 1, 31 and 36 as well
as the Chorzéw Factory Case'*"°, the Respondent is obliged to repair in full any damages
arising from the breach of the ECT, namely the adoption of the Disputed Measures.'*?! The
Claimant asserts that full reparation means putting the Claimant in the same pecuniary
position as it would be in but for the Respondent’s breach of the ECT, and that the amount
of compensation is best evaluated by comparing the income streams in the actual scenario
with those in a but-for scenario in which the breach had not been committed. '32?

The Claimant contends that the total amount of compensation consists of historical
damages, present damages, pre- and post-award interest and any gross-up needed as a result
of the award attracting any taxes.!??

As to historical damages, the Claimant submits that they account for the impact of the
Respondent’s breach from 28 February 2012 (i.e. the entry into force of Regional Act
1/2012, being the first measure challenged by the Claimant) until 21 June 2014 (i.e. the
valuation date asserted by the Claimant). According to the Claimant, the historical damages
amount to approximately EUR 12 million.'**4

Regarding present damages, the Claimant asserts that they account for the reduction in the
fair market value of its financial interest in the CSP Plant and Wind Farms as of 21 June
2014, due to the Disputed Measures. The Claimant quantifies its present damages based on
a DCF analysis of the actual and but-for scenarios, relying on Brattle’s assumptions as
indicated in section VII.A.2.d.iii(2)(a) supra. After estimating the value of the SPVs
(taking into account the net present value of the side-effects of external financing) and
subtracting the market value of the project finance debt from the asset value of

shareholders’ loans and common equity, an illiquidity discount is applied to reflect the lack
of marketability of the investment interests compared to publicly traded shares. As a result
of the foregoing, the Claimant calculates present damages of EUR 129 million, resulting
in a total of EUR 141 million including the historical damages.'*?°

The Claimant objects to the Respondent’s assertion that the foregoing DCF analysis is
speculative and unsuitable for assessing damages in the present case. In particular, the
Claimant dismisses the Respondent’s criticism that Brattle’s but-for scenario is overvalued.
As regards the Respondent’s comparison of the IRR allegedly implicit in Brattle’s
valuation with the discount rate used by Brattle, the Claimant contends that this
inappropriately compares equity returns with a weighted average cost of capital, which
includes external financing. In addition, the Claimant asserts that large parts of the
difference between the implicit IRR and the originally expected IRR is due to the general
decline in Spanish interest rates since the investment. With respect to the Respondent’s
comparison between Brattle’s valuation and the book value of the investment, the Claimant
asserts that the market-to-book premium is reasonable and consistent with evidence on
market transactions involving CSP and wind assets.'*?

As to the Respondent’s own (subsidiary) DCF calculation, the Claimant argues that the
assumptions underlying the calculation are unrealistic and that, in respect of the Wind
Farms, the Respondent committed a calculation error and anyway fails to perform a true
DCF analysis, with the but-for scenario instead being a backward-looking assessment of
the plant’s past profitability.'*?7

Subsidiarily, the Claimant submits that even if all that was guaranteed under RF1 had been
a reasonable return that the Respondent could change from time to time, the Respondent
would still be liable for damages based on the IRRs underlying RF1, namely 9.5% post-
tax for the CSP Plants and 7% post-tax for the Wind Farms. The Claimant asserts that this
subsidiary damage calculation yields a total of EUR 118 million in principal damages.!**

With respect to pre-and post-award interest, the Claimant argues that this is expressly
foreseen by Article 26(8) ECT and ILC Article 38. As to pre-award interest, the Claimant
submits that its main function is to safeguard the principle of full reparation, and that it
should be calculated from June 2014 to the date of the award, at the prevailing Spanish 10-
year bond rates in each month, compounded monthly. The Claimant considers the 10-year
bond rate to be an appropriate proxy for a commercial borrowing rate, and notes that it has
been lower than the actual borrowing costs of the CSP SPVs and Wind SPVs. Regarding
post-award interest, the Claimant submits that it is widely recognized that a defaulting
respondent defaulting on an award should be penalized by an interest rate that is no longer
limited to the concrete damage suffered by the injured party, but is instead higher to
incentivize prompt compliance with the award. According to the Claimant, it is appropriate

and in line with Spanish domestic law'*” to add a “moratorium differential” of two
percentage points to the pre-award interest, compounded monthly.'**°

1020 Finally, as regards a tax gross-up, the Claimant submits that this is necessary to achieve
full compensation because such taxes are an unavoidable consequence of the Respondent’s
breach.'*#! The Claimant requests that the amount to be awarded by the Tribunal be
calculated and expressed in the Award according to the formula A/(1-T), where A would
be the damages to be awarded to the Claimant and T would be the accumulate of any tax,
withholding or equivalent concept eventually applicable to the payment of damages in any
relevant jurisdiction.'**? The Claimant disagrees with the Respondent’s assertion that a
favourable award would not be taxable in Luxembourg, given that such award would be
made in favour of the Claimant, not any of its Spanish subsidiaries, thus rendering the EU’s
participation exemption inapplicable. In addition, the Claimant contends that its damages
calculation is post-tax, meaning that if no tax gross-up were awarded, there would be an
effective double-taxation on the Claimant, once based on the Spanish taxation considered
in the damages assessment and once for the Luxembourg taxes that an award would attract.

B. The Respondent’s Principal Arguments

1021 The Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to meet its burden of proof as its
damage calculation is entirely speculative and ignores the basic concepts of regulatory life
and a reasonable return on the investment made. In particular, the Respondent argues that
in a regulated sector, it is unrealistic to assume that the but-for and actual scenarios will be
maintained over decades, irrespective of whether the return achieved is reasonable. !333

1022 Moreover, the Respondent contends that the DCF method is inappropriate in this case, for
the reasons mentioned already in {781 supra, and that the ABV method is to be
preferred. '3*4

1023 The Respondent asserts that the amount sought by the Claimant confirms the validity of
the above arguments. In particular, the Respondent submits that the value of the plants

book value, which according to the Respondent constitutes the closest approximation to

the market value. Similarly, the Respondent contends that the IRR implicit in the but-for
value computed by Brattle is 33.8% on average for the CSP Plants and 23.1% on average
for the Wind Farms, which the Respondent claims is disproportionate and also much higher
than the discount rate used by Brattle itself to determine the equity value at the valuation
date (4.8% and 4.4%, respectively). The Respondent argues that there is no rational
justification for Brattle’s but-for value, especially considering that this is not a
monopolized market, that the valuation date is close to the date of the construction of the
plants, and that this is a capital-intensive sector in which intangible values or know-how
are irrelevant to the valuation. As to the Claimant’s argument that the fall of interest rates
explains much of the but-for valuation, the Respondent submits that this is further
confirmation of the speculative nature of the DCF method, and of the fact that the return
on investment must be dynamic in order to avoid excessive fluctuations in investment
value. !335

The Respondent further argues that the reality checks conducted by Brattle are flawed. In
particular, the few transactions used by Brattle as a reference do not meet the minimum
requirements for comparability. In addition, a more plausible reality check based on the
ratings of the main rating agencies and the information provided by two “YieldCos”
confirms that the Disputed Measures were positive and reduced regulatory risk.!7°°

In addition, the Respondent claims that even if one uses the DCF method but on the basis
of more realistic assumptions (Accuracy’s assumptions as mentioned in section
VII.A.2.d.iii(2)(a) supra), the Claimant either suffered no damage at all or much lower
damage than asserted. As to the Claimant’s investment in the CSP Plants, the Respondent
contends that it is actually worth significantly more in the actual scenario than in the but-
for scenario, i.e. no damage was suffered, because the CSP Plants had an installed capacity
exceeding 50 MW. Even if applying the remuneration values of RF1 for CSP Plants not
exceeding such installed capacity, the Respondent avers that the Claimant’s damage would
only be EUR 5.9 million, being 92% lower than the damage calculated by the Claimant. 37
Regarding the Wind Farms, the Respondent submits that any damage would be
“proportionally negligible”, given that a realistic DCF analysis yields a difference of only
1.7 million between RF1 and RF2/RF3, for all Wind Farms combined. In addition, the
Respondent points out that the Wind Farms have been practically amortised and that the
pool prices exceed the operating costs. Therefore, the Claimant cannot expect to continue
receiving any subsidies, even in the but-for scenario.'**

With respect to interest, the Respondent argues that if any damages were to be awarded,
pre-award interest should not accrue at the rate of 10-year bonds but rather bonds reflecting
the duration between the valuation date and the date of the award, which the Respondent
estimates to be approximately 2-3 years. As to post-award interest, the Respondent submits
that adding any differential to the pre-award rate would run counter to the principle of full
reparation. Specifically, the Respondent refers to Commentary (4) on ILC Article 36,

whereby compensation “is not concerned to punish the responsible State, nor does
compensation have an expressive or exemplary character” .'*? In addition, the Respondent
argues that the Claimant’s reference to the Spanish Civil Procedure Act is misplaced in an
international law context, and is anyway incorrect as a matter of Spanish law because in
cases of default by the Spanish administration, Articles 17 and 24 of the General Budgetary
Act provide for simple (not compound) interest at the “fixed legal interest” rate, and only
after a grace period of three months.!*°
1027. As regards any tax-gross up, the Respondent mainly'*! submits that any payment
obligation under the arbitral award would not be subject to any taxes in Luxembourg,
because any such payment would fall under the participation exemption of the EU’s Parent-
Subsidiary Directive.'**? In this context, the Respondent also relies on Venezuela Holdings
v. Venezuela, which dismissed a claim for compensation related to foreign taxation on the
basis that such claim was “speculative and uncertain”, and notes that the Claimant has not
supplied any information, let alone evidence, on the alleged possibility of taxation in
Luxembourg, such as the legal basis, the taxable event or the tax rate.!343

Cc. The Tribunal’s Analysis

1028 The Tribunal’s findings on damages reflect the view of the majority, with Arbitrator Sands
dissenting.

1029 The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant, and the Respondent has not disputed, that due to
the lack of specific provisions in the ECT on the standard of compensation (except in case
of lawful expropriations), this question is governed by customary international law. The
Tribunal further agrees that based on ILC Article 36(1) and Chorzéw Factory, the
applicable principle is that of full reparation, wiping out the consequences of the illegal
act.

1030 The Tribunal does not agree with the Claimant, however, that this approach entails
constructing a but-for scenario in which RF1 would have remained unchanged. As per the
Tribunal’s findings on responsibility, the Respondent breached the FET standard by
exceeding the acceptable margin of legislative change, thus violating the Claimant’s
legitimate expectation of Relative Stability. The illegality of the Disputed Measures under
the ECT is therefore limited to that portion which exceeds the acceptable margin. If the

but-for scenario assumed a petrification of RF1, the Respondent would be liable for
damages also to the extent that the Disputed Measures were still within the acceptable
margin. Such damages calculation would be neither appropriate nor in line with the
principle of full reparation, which merely calls for undoing any damage flowing from
illegality.

The Tribunal is of course aware of the difficulties in attempting to precisely demarcate the
outer boundary of the acceptable margin of change. However, the Tribunal does not find
these difficulties to be categorically different from those inherent to any assessment of
damages in complex cases such as the present one. As aptly described in Eiser v. Spain,
“in a case of such scope and complexity damages cannot be determined with mechanical
precision” 34 That said, the Tribunal is confident that its assessment of damages, as set
out below, does justice to both Parties, taking into account both the Claimant’s burden to
prove its damage and the fact that due to its violation of the legitimate expectation of
Relative Stability, it was the Respondent that created the need for the Tribunal to decide
how much of the impact inflicted on the Claimant by the Disputed Measures still falls
within the acceptable margin of change.

As already explained in section VII.A.2.d.iii(2) above, the Tribunal agrees with the
Claimant that the DCF methodology is an appropriate means of determining the Claimant’s
damages in this case. In addition, as a matter of principle, the Tribunal sees no reason to
depart on the level of quantum from the assumptions underlying its DCF analysis in the
framework of its findings on responsibility (see again section VII.A.2.d.iii(2) above).
However, as regards the construction of the but-for scenario, it is necessary to make some
changes compared to the initial but-for scenario used in the context of responsibility (which
assumed that RFI would remain unchanged), in order to reflect the foregoing finding that
the Respondent shall be liable only for the damage caused by the portion of the Disputed
Measures that exceeded the acceptable margin.

On this basis, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to first construct an alternative but-for
scenario that is described in subsection 1. infra. After that, the Tribunal will make a finding
on the illiquidity discount to be applied in order to determine the Claimant’s damage (see
subsection 2. infra) before calculating the principal damages to which the Claimant is
entitled (see subsection 3. infra). Finally, the Tribunal will make findings on the Claimant’s
requests for interest (see subsection 4. infra) and a tax-gross up (see subsection 5. infra).

Construction of the Alternative But-for Scenario

1345 1346

Based on the corresponding findings on responsibility, and largely'**° in accordance
with Procedural Order No. 14, the Tribunal finds that it is appropriate to make the following
adjustments to the ‘initial’ but-for scenario (as used in the context of responsibility, i.e.
RF1 remaining unchanged) in order to derive the ‘alternative’ but-for scenario based on
which quantum is to be determined.

First, contrary to the initial but-for scenario, the alternative but-for scenario shall include
RDL 2/2013, which shall however enter into force only on | February 2013 (i.e. not with
retroactive effect as of 1 January 2013, as in the actual scenario), with the assumption being
that the Claimant’s facilities chose the Regulated Tariff as of that date. The Experts disagreed
on how to implement this adjustment in the Joint Model, with Brattle suggesting that the
Regulated Tariff could apply either permanently or only temporarily until July 2013 (when, in
the actual scenario, RDL 2/2013 was replaced by RF3), while Accuracy agues that RDL 2/2013
must apply permanently. This disagreement is based on the same arguments as the Expert’s
disagreement on whether the TVPEE shall apply permanently or until the measure was
replaced in the actual scenario (see {{[847-849 supra). For similar reasons as in that context,
the Tribunal finds that in the alternative but-for scenario, RDL 2/2013 shall apply permanently.
In particular, the alternative but-for scenario is meant to isolate the damage inflicted on the
Claimant by those Disputed Measures that exceeded the acceptable margin of change. Due
to this logic, the alternative but-for scenario must include all Disputed Measures that
remained within the acceptable margin of change, which includes RDL 2/2013. If the
alternative but-for scenario included RDL 2/2013 only up until the point in time when it
was replaced, in the actual scenario, by another Disputed Measure, this would mix the but-
for world with the actual world. This, in turn, would render it impossible for the Tribunal
to isolate the damage inflicted by the Disputed Measures that went beyond the acceptable
margin of change.

Secondly, as of 14 July 2013, i.e. the day on which RDL 9/2013 came into force, both the
supplement and the penalty for reactive energy shall be eliminated. While RDL 9/2013
eliminated only the supplement, the Tribunal would not find it appropriate if damages were
reduced by the corresponding penalty (that RDL 9/2013 maintained). Even though it has
remained unclear, based on the Parties’ submissions, if any such penalty could be expected to
apply, the Tribunal eliminates the penalty from the alternative but-for scenario to be on the safe
side.

See 9913 supra. The Tribunal does not find it necessary to address in the alternative but-for scenario the Operating

Threshold or Minimum Operating (because all of the Claimant’s facilities will exceed these thresholds under any of
the available forecasts) or the obligation to contribute to the financing of the tariff deficit up to 2% (because no such
payments are foreseen in the actual scenario either).

1346 The only differences are in accordance with the Tribunal’s instructions to the Experts of 19 April 2021,
respectively the Expert’s agreement that the IRR cap shall apply as of July 2013 instead of the valuation date (see the
Expert’s Joint Memorandum of 4 June 2021, (7).

254

1037

1038

1039

1040

1041

Thirdly, as of 21 June 2014, i.e. the day on which MO IET/1045/2014 entered into force, the
CSP Plants and Wind Farms shall be subject to a limitation whereby they will not receive any
feed-in remuneration after 25 or 20 years of operation, respectively.

Fourthly, as of 2014, the CSP Plants shall receive feed-in remuneration only for up to 2,040
hours of annual operation. The Experts disagreed on how to implement this adjustment in the
Joint Model. Brattle submitted that this cap can apply only to solar production, while
Accuracy argued that it must apply to the overall production including through the burning
of Back-up Fuel. The Tribunal shares Accuracy’s view on this point. The rationale behind
this adjustment to the ‘initial’ but-for scenario is to include the very cap introduced by RF3,
which the Tribunal found not to be in breach of the ECT. RF3, in turn, limits feed-in
remuneration to 2,040 hours of annual operation without distinguishing between different
sources of energy. This implies that it is an overall cap that includes also the energy
produced through Back-up Fuel. This is also consistent with the fact that the previous cap
introduced by RF2 applied also to production through Back-up Fuel, as acknowledged by
Brattle.'*47 In the Tribunal’s view, there is no indication that RF3 sought to depart from
that approach taken in RF2. While Brattle argues that such departure derives from the fact
that RF3 eliminated the use of Back-up Fuel, this assertion is factually incorrect because
RF3 merely reduced the cap on such use.

Fifthly, as of 15 October 2014, i.e. the day on which MO IET/1882/2014 entered into force,
an annual cap of 15,000 thermal MWh shall apply to the payment of feed-in remuneration for
energy produced at the CSP Plants through the burning of LNG.

Sixthly and finally, as of July 2013,'*“* the Wind Farms and the CSP Plants shall be subject to
a prospective IRR cap of 7% respectively 8% post-tax (excluding financing). This reflects the
Tribunal’s view that while the RF1 Reference IRRs did not represent a guaranteed level of
remuneration, diligent investors could not expect to receive, for the entire lifetime of their
plants, subsidies that lifted their IRRs above those RFI Reference IRRs. In other words, in the
circumstances prevailing at the time the Disputed Measures were taken, the Respondent could
have reduced the feed-in remuneration at least to the extent that it previously allowed the
Claimant’s facilities to achieve IRRs beyond the RF1 Reference IRRs. Accordingly, the
Tribunal finds it appropriate to implement a respective cap in its alternative but-for scenario.

Illiquidity Discount

The Experts agree,'*? as does the Tribunal, that it is appropriate to apply an illiquidity
discount to account for the lack of marketability of the Claimant’s investment. However,
the Experts disagree on what this discount should be. Brattle computed 25% in the actual
scenario (assuming it would take 12 months to find a buyer for the Claimant’s shareholding
in the Wind Farms and CSP Plants) and 12% in the but-for scenario (3 months to find a

1347 See Brattle’s Memorandum of 22 September 2020, 418.

'48 The Tribunal had initially instructed the Experts to apply this cap as of the valuation date. However, as both
Experts agreed that July 2013 would be more appropriate, the Tribunal has deferred to their joint view.

1349 See BQR I, (181; Accuracy I, 9644.

buyer).!°*° Accuracy, by contrast, calculated 16.7% in the actual scenario (assuming 3
months to find a buyer) and 35% in the but-for scenario (12 months to find a buyer).!*°!

The Tribunal notes that the different correlation between each Expert’s illiquidity discount
and the corresponding period for finding a buyer is explained by the fact that Accuracy
looked at market liquidity in 2012 while Brattle looked at 2014, as per their respective
valuation dates. The Tribunal further notes that the illiquidity discount is closely related to
regulatory risk,!*°? which explains why Brattle assumes a decrease in the illiquidity
discount from the actual scenario to the but-for scenario, while Accuracy takes the opposite
view.

In light of the Tribunal’s above findings on the valuation date and on regulatory risk,'*°?
the Tribunal finds it most appropriate to apply Brattle’s liquidity discount, as calculated for
the actual scenario, to both the actual and the but-for scenario.

Principal Damages

The Tribunal’s assumptions for the DCF analysis, including the above-described
adjustments to the but-for scenario and the foregoing finding on the applicable illiquidity
discount, are reflected in the Joint Model prepared by the Experts based on the Tribunal’s
instructions.'**4 Pursuant to the Joint Model, the discounted cash-flows of the Claimant’s

1046 Consequently, the Joint Model computes the overall damage suffered by the Claimant, as
at the valuation date, to amount to EUR 32,896,240. The Tribunal has no indication that
this computation agreed by the Experts could be mathematically incorrect or otherwise not
aligned with the Tribunal’s DCF modelling assumptions. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that
the Respondent is entitled to this amount in principal damages.

257

4, Interest

1047 The Tribunal has no hesitation in finding, and the Respondent does not seem to dispute,
that the principle of full reparation entitles the Claimant to payment of interest.

1048 As to the pre-award interest rate, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that Spanish 10-
year bonds are an appropriate benchmark. First, even if one followed the Respondent’s
argument that the bond duration should mirror the time between the valuation date and the
award date, this would make 10-years bonds a better approximation than the 2-3 year bonds
suggested by the Respondent. Secondly, the Respondent itself refers in RF3 to 10-year
bonds as a proxy for the cost of money on the capital market.

1049 With respect to the post-award interest rate, the Parties have referred the Tribunal to arbitral
jurisprudence supporting their respective views on whether a differential should be applied
on pre-award interest so as to incentivize compliance with the arbitral award. The Tribunal
is more convinced by the line of jurisprudence rejecting such differential. In particular, as
reflected in ILC Article 38(1), interest is meant to uphold the principle of full reparation as
provided for in ILC Article 36. This principle, as confirmed by paragraph 4 of the ILC
commentary on Article 36, “is not concerned to punish the responsible State, nor does
compensation have an expressive or exemplary character”.'> The Tribunal is not
convinced that this rationale applies only to pre-award interest, but not to post-award
interest, as argued by the Claimant. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the same interest rate
shall apply pre- and post-award.

1050 As regards compound interest, the Respondent did not address the Claimant’s request that
interest be compounded monthly.'**° Considering this lack of opposition, and noting that
many tribunals faced with similar claims against the Respondent have accepted monthly
compound interest,'*>’ the Tribunal is satisfied that interest shall be compounded monthly.

5. Tax Gross-up

1051 Asa starting point, the Tribunal notes that none of the precedents invoked by the Claimant
in support of its position dealt with the question of whether a host State that is found to
have violated an investment treaty must compensate the investor for taxes that the award

1355 Quoted per “Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries,
2001” (RL-0032), submitted by the International Law Commission to the United Nations General Assembly as part
of the Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-sixth Session, Supplement No. 10 and corrigendum (A/56/10
and Corr.1).

1356 The only mention of compound interest in the Respondent’s memorials relates to the Spanish General Budgetary
Act, which the Respondent argues provides for “simple (not compound) interest” (RjoM, $1720). However, the
Respondent itself submits that the interest rate cannot be derived from domestic law, see RjoM, 41719.

may attract in its home State. Indeed, the Tribunal finds it doubtful whether any such
taxation would qualify as a consequential loss arising from the Disputed Measures, and
notes there are multiple arbitral awards denying or at least questioning such causal link.!7>*

1052 However, the Tribunal does not need to decide this question because it finds that, in any
case, the Claimant has failed to substantiate, let alone prove, its assertion that an award in
this matter may be subject to taxes in Luxembourg.'*°? The Claimant has not identified any
legal basis for such taxes, has not specified the alleged tax rate, and has not convincingly
rebutted the Respondent’s argument on the EU’s participation exemption. Thus, the
Tribunal is not satisfied that the present award may be subject to Luxembourg taxes, much
less that such taxes would exceed the taxes that the Claimant would have had to pay on
corresponding dividends it would have received from its investment but for the Disputed
Measures.

1053 Similarly, while the Claimant seems to have upheld its request that any award be expressed
net of Spanish taxes, the Claimant has not made any specific submissions in support of this
request. In particular, the Claimant has not substantiated which Spanish taxes, if any, this
award may attract, and how this would compare to potential Spanish taxation of any
amounts the Claimant would have received but for the Disputed Measures.

1054 Therefore, the Claimant’s claim for a tax gross-up is dismissed. The Tribunal notes that,
based on the jurisprudence on record, the same position was taken by all tribunals faced
with similar claims against the Respondent, to the extent a tax gross-up was requested in
those cases.'5°

albeit not in relation to taxation of the award.

1359 This further distinguishes the present case from the recomendations by the United Nations Compensation
Commission Governing Council in Saudi Arabian Texaco v. Iraq (CL-0267), as invoked by the Claimant (see fn. 1331
supra). In that case, the Commission emphasized at [454 that Saudi Arabian Texaco had produced evidence suggesting
that Saudi Arabia would view any award on the relevant claim as taxable income.

The Claimant accepts that there exists a wide consensus that, under Article 61(2) ICSID
Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 28, the Tribunal enjoys “a degree of discretion”
to decide the allocation of costs. However, the Claimant argues that the ICSID
Convention’s travaux préparatoires, the practice of ICSID tribunals, the practice followed
by other arbitration regimes as well as commentary provide guidance for the exercise of
such discretion. '** In this regard, the Claimant highlights the principles of ‘costs follow
the event’ and that a party that is responsible for a particular part of the proceedings should
bear the resulting costs.'**

The Claimant submits that in accordance with the ‘costs follow the event’ rule, if the
Respondent is found liable under the ECT, the Claimant is entitled to recover from the
Respondent the reasonable costs arising from this arbitration.'**

Moreover, based on the second principle mentioned in {1056 supra, the Claimant contends
that, in any case, if the Respondent’s intra-EU objection is dismissed, the Respondent
should bear the costs resulting from the EC’s applications for leave to intervene as an

'361 Claimant’s Submission on Costs of 24 November 2021 (“C-SoC”), {[7-11.

amicus curiae. The Claimant alleges that those costs are inextricably linked to that
objection. The Claimant stresses that the intra-EU objection was raised despite the fact that
such objection had been rejected already by a “jurisprudence constante et cohérente”, and
that the Respondent and the EC followed a coordinated strategy that caused the Claimant
an unfair prejudice.'*°°

Based on the same principle, the Claimant argues that it should be entitled to recover, in
any case, the costs resulting from the Respondent’s request for bifurcation. In the
Claimant’s view, all of the Respondent’s preliminary objections (on which the request for
bifurcation was based) were frivolous and/or inextricably linked to the merits.'°°7

Finally, the Claimant avers that the costs incurred by it are reasonable. In particular, the
Claimant claims that the number of hours devoted by the legal team is appropriate
considering all circumstances and the complexity of the case, as are the hourly rates
charged. Moreover, the Claimant asserts that the assessment of reasonability of the costs is
not to be judged against the Respondent’s legal costs.'*%

The Respondent’s Submission on Costs

The Respondent submits that it has incurred the following costs in connection with this
arbitration:'56°

The Respondent argues that ICSID tribunals enjoy wide and unfettered discretion to
allocate costs pursuant to Article 61(2) ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 28,
and highlights that the ECT likewise is silent on the issue of how the costs of dispute
resolution are to be allocated.'”° According to the Respondent, ICSID tribunals typically
allocate costs between the Parties based on a number of factors including, without

limitation, the extent to which a party has succeeded on its various claims and
arguments. !°7

The Respondent contends that if it ultimately prevails in this arbitration, it is entitled to a
reimbursement of its costs on a full indemnity basis. In the alternative, the Respondent
submits that it should never be ordered to bear the Claimant’s costs, even if the Tribunal
were to uphold the Claimant’s claim, since the case involved a number of challenging
procedural and legal issues that were addressed by the Respondent with professional and
effective advocacy.

The Tribunal’s Decision on Costs

Article 61(2) ICSID Convention provides:

 
 

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree,
assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide
how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and
the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part
of the award.

 

   

 

As expressly acknowledged by both Parties, the Tribunal therefore has discretion to
allocate the arbitration costs (i.e. the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID’s
charges) as well as the expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with the arbitration.

In the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal does not find it appropriate to apply a strict
form of ‘costs follow the event’ as advocated by the Claimant, ie. to hold that the
Respondent shall bear most or all of the arbitraton costs because it was found to have
breached the ECT. Instead, the Tribual wishes to reflect in the apportionement of costs that
both Parties have prevailed on significant aspects of the case, each of which has contributed
to the costs of this arbitration.

On jurisdiction, the Respondent prevailed with its objections in relation to the TVPEE and
TEE, while the Claimant prevailed on the request for bifurcation and all of the
Respondent’s other (and time-consuming) jurisdictional objections, including in particular
the intra-EU objection. Similarly, both Parties prevailed partially on responsibility. The
Respondent successfully defended itself in particular against the claims for unlawful
expropriation and breach of the umbrella clause. By contrast, the Claimant ultimately
prevailed with its legitimate expectations claim; however, the scope of the legitimate
expectations accepted by the Tribunal is narrower than asserted by the Claimant. Moreover,
the Respondent prevailed to a large extent on quantum as the Claimant is awarded only
about 16% of the principal damages requested.'*”? That said, the Respondent did breach
the ECT and therefore gave the Claimant reasonable cause to initiate arbitral proceedings.

 

ing into account that the Claimant initially quantified its request for a tax-gross up, which was dismissed in its

 

entirety, at EUR 60 million. Disregarding the tax-gross up, the success rate would be approximately 23%.

262

This leads the Tribunal not to overestimate the importance of the rather low percentages
by which the Claimant prevailed on quantum.

1068 On balance, taking all of the foregoing into account, the Tribunal finds it appropriate that
each of the Parties bears half of the arbitration costs and that each Party bears its own

expenses incurred in relation to the arbitration.

1069 As to the arbitration costs, ICSID has set the costs as follows in accordance with Article 59
ICSID Convention:

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses

Judge Bruno Simma USD 596,961.32
Professor Christoph Schreuer USD 276,698.63
Professor Philippe Sands QC USD 158,123.24
Mr. Heiner Kahlert’s fees and expenses USD 216,148.55
ICSID’s administrative fees USD 306,000.00
Direct expenses (estimated) USD 247,933.70
Total USD 1,801,865.44

1070 The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties as follows: The
Claimants have paid USD 943,176.68 and the Respondent has paid USD 924,617.00.

1071 Accordingly, neither party is entitled to any reimbursement of arbitration costs by the other

Party. Instead, the remaining balance of the advances will be reimbursed to the Parties in
proportion to the payments that each has advanced to ICSID.

263
