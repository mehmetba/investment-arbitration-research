L INTRODUCTION

On 7 September 2011, the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes [“ICSID”
or “Centre”] received a request for arbitration [“Request for Arbitration] from OI European
Group B.V. [“OLEG” or “Claimant”], against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela [“Venezuela”
or the “Respondent” or the “Republic.”]

On 9 September 2011, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request for Arbitration, and the
payment of the corresponding registration fee.

Initially, the Claimant was represented in these proceedings by the law firm Volterra Fietta, with
offices in London, United Kingdom, and Latham Watkins with offices in Chicago, Illinois, USA
and London, United Kingdom. The Claimant is currently represented by: (a) the Volterra Fietta law
firm, and specifically the attorneys Robert Volterra, Stephen Fietta, Patricio Grané Labat and
Alvaro Nistal; (b) the law firm Escritorio Muci-Abraham, with offices in Caracas, Venezuela, and
specifically Mr. José Antonio Muci, and (c) Mr. Lucas Bastin, of Quadrant Chambers, in London,
United Kingdom.

The Respondent was initially represented by the Office of the Attorney General of Venezuela, by
the Acting Attorney General, Dr. Manuel Enrique Galindo Ballesteros, and the law firm Shearman
& Sterling LLP, with offices in Washington, D.C., USA and Paris, France specifically by the
attorneys Fernando Mantilla Serrano, Thomas B. Wilner and Christopher M. Ryan. On 22 May

IL. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE PROCEEDINGS

On 26 September 2011, the Secretary General of the ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in
accordance with Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of Other States [“ICSID Convention”) and notified the parties that it had
been registered.

The proceedings were initiated based on the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal
Protection of Investments between the Republic of Venezuela and the Kingdom of the Netherlands
[“Venezuela-Netherlands BIT” or the “Netherlands — Venezuela BIT” or the “BIT”] signed on
22 October 1991 and entering into force on 1 November 1993, to remain in force for fifteen years.
In relation to the Venezuela-Netherlands BIT, in its Request for Arbitration the Claimant stated that
on 30 April 2008, Venezuela presented a notice of termination, six months prior to the expiration
date of the BIT. Consequently, the Claimant argued that Article 14(3) of the BIT provides that “[iJn
relation to the investments made prior to the termination date of this Agreement, the foregoing
Articles of the same shall remain in effect for an additional period of fifteen years from said date.”
The Claimant concluded that the proceeding should be conducted based on the Venezuela-
Netherlands BIT.

In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute a
Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre’s Rules of Procedure for
the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration F ings [the itution Rules.”]

 

Given that more than sixty (60) days had passed since the registration of the Request for Arbitration
without the parties having reached an agreement regarding how to constitute the Tribunal, the
Claimant invoked Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention by letter of 15 December 2011.

By letter of the same date, the Claimant appointed as arbitrator Professor Francisco Orrego Vicufia,
a Chilean national of the Republic of Chile.

By letter of 19 December 2011, Professor Orrego Vicufia accepted his appointment as arbitrator in
these proceedings.

Ninety (90) days having elapsed since the registration of the Request for Arbitration without the
Tribunal having been constituted, by letter of 28 December 2011, the Claimant requested that the
Chairman of the Administrative Council of the ICSID appoint the arbitrators who had not yet been
appointed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, and Rule 4 of
the Procedural Rules Applicable to ICSID Arbitration Proceedings [the “Arbitration Rules.”]

By letter of 29 December 2011, Dr. Carlos Escarra Malavé, Attorney General of the Republic,
acknowledged receipt of the Claimant’s letter of 28 December 201 land stated that he was in the

process of engaging the services of a law firm and outside counsel for this matter and that he would
proceed to appoint the corresponding arbitrator.

By letter of 11 January 2012, Venezuela communicated that Messrs Thomas Wilner, Christopher
M. Ryan, José Pertierra and Fernando Mantilla Serrano of the law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP,
in Washington, D.C., in addition to the Office of the Attorney General, via the Attorney General of
the Republic, Dr. Carlos Escarra Malavé and Ana Maria de Stefano Lo Piano, would represent the
Respondent in this case.

By letter of 12 January 2012, the Respondent appointed Mr. Alexis Mourre, a French national, as
arbitrator.

On 13 January 2012, Mr. Alexis Mourre accepted his appointment as arbitrator in these
proceedings.

By letter of 2 February 2012, the Respondent reported the death of Dr. Carlos Escarra Malavé and
the appointment, on the same date, of the new Attorney General of the Republic, Dr. Cilia Flores.
In said letter and in view of the circumstances, the Respondent asked for these arbitration
proceedings to be postponed for two months so that Dr. Flores could familiarize herself with the
case and participate in Venezuela’s defense.

On 3 February 2012, the Claimant i its on the dent’s request, opposing,
said postponement, since a) the Respondent had been being represented by outside counsel during
the proceeding, b) the outside counsel had sufficient authority to act on behalf of their client, c) the
new Attorney General had already been appointed, and d) the proceedings were still in the initial
stages.

By letter of 10 February 2012, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Respondent’s request and the
Claimant’s objections of 2 and 3 February 2012, respectively. The Centre informed the parties that
the Claimant had requested the appointment of the arbitrators that had not yet been appointed in
accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules,
and that it would move forward with said request in the next few days.

After consulting with the parties, and in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, and
Rule 4 of the Arbitration Rules, on 29 March 2012, the Chairman of the Administrative Council of
the ICSID appointed Professor Juan Fernandez-Armesto, a Spanish national, as the third Arbitrator
and President of the Tribunal. On 30 March 2012, Professor Fernandez-Armesto accepted his
appointment as arbitrator and President of the Tribunal.

On 30 March 2012, the Secretary-General notified the parties under Rule 6(1) of the ICSID
Arbitration Rules, that the three arbitrators had accepted their respective appointments, and that the

First Session signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal on 14 June 2012, which
were distributed to the Parties on the same date.

On 18 June 2012, the Claimant asked the Tribunal to modify section 13.4.4 of the Minutes of the

letter of 21 June 2012, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was not necessary to amend section
13.4.4. of the Minutes of the First Session, and moreover presented an example to illustrate the
purpose of section 13.4.4.

In accordance with the procedural calendar set forth in the Minutes of the First Session, the
Claimant submitted its Memorial on 1 August 2012 [“CI”]. The translation of the Memorial was

On 30 October 2012, the Claimant sent the Members of the Tribunal a full copy in Spanish of all
the Exhibits to the Claimant’s Memorial, in addition to the expert report by Mr. Brent Kaczmarek.

On 27 November 2012, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of the registration of ICSID. Case
No. ARB/12/21 and argued that Case ARB/12/21 was related to this case and, for reasons of

Respondent to adhere to the procedural calendar established in the Minutes of the First Session. On

receipt of the Parties’ letters and decided not to suspend the proceedings, ordered Venezuela to

the Parties felt at any time further steps should be taken, they should present a substantiated request
to the Tribunal, which would make a decision after hearing the other Party.

Tl. PETITIONS OF THE PARTIES
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ PETITIONS

OIEG asks that the Tribunal dismiss the objections to jurisdiction raised by the Respondent and
declare that Venezuela, with respect to the Claimant, has violated five protection standards of the
Venezuela-Netherlands BIT. Specifically, the Claimant requests a declaration that:

- it suffered the expropriation of its investment;
- it suffered unfair and inequitable treatment;
- it did not enjoy the physical safety and protection of its investment;

- the Respondent breached the obligations assumed in connection with the treatment given the
foreign investments of Dutch nationals;

- it did not enjoy the guaranteed transfer of payments related to its investment

The Claimant additionally asks that the Tribunal declare that Venezuela caused indirect damages
as the result of the use of the expropriated assets and that it must pay for moral damages.

As indemnification for the damages suffered, OIEG is requesting a compensation of no less than
USD 929,544,714, plus compound interest on the amount awarded by the Tribunal as damages,
capitalized annually from the date of the expropriation up to the date of the award, and capitalized
from the date of the award up to the actual payment date; as well as the award of the costs of this
arbitration against the Respondent or, alternatively, the award of the costs with respect to the
preliminary objections and the request for bifurcation and any other reparation that the Tribunal
deems appropriate.

For its part, the Respondent requests, first, that the Tribunal declare its lack of jurisdiction to hear
this dispute and declare the Claimants’ claims inadmissible. Secondarily, the Bolivarian Republic
of Venezuela asks the Tribunal to dismiss the claims set forth by the Claimants in their entirety
and award the costs generated by this arbitration against them.

Iv. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

1. GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE CASE

85.

The dispute arises from the expropriation of the two largest glass container production plants in
Venezuela. The Claimant alleges that this expropriation was carried out illegally and with no
compensation, and that the Respondent’s behavior with regard to the Claimant’s investments
breached numerous obligations under the BIT, requesting a sizeable compensation. On the other
hand, in addition to rejecting the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the Respondent denies that the Claimant
made an investment and contends that there was no breach of the BIT.

2. DRAMATIS PERSONAE

86.

87.

OIEG

The Claimant is OI European Group B.V. [“OITEG”] a company incorporated on 17 February 1999
in accordance with the laws of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.’ OIEG is part of the group
controlled by Owns-Illinois Group, Inc. [“O¥"],? one of the world’s largest glass container
manufacturers.

QldV and Favianca

The Claimant and Ol] hold equity interests in glass production and distribution companies
throughout the world. In Venezuela, OIG operated through two companies in which it was the
majority shareholder [the “Companies”]:

- Owens-Illinois de Venezuela C.A. [“OIdV”] incorporated on 13 April 1958,° in which the
Claimant holds 73.97% of the shares;* and

- Fabrica de Vidrios los Andes C.A. [“Favianca”] incorporated on 8 August 1968,° in which the
Claimant directly holds 32% of the shares® and indirectly holds 39.996%’ (i.e. 71.996% of the
shares directly and indirectly).

The Companies were owners of two industrial plants for the production, processing and
distribution of glass containers in Venezuela: OldV operated in the Los Guayos plant in Carabobo
State, and Favianca operated in the Valera Plant in Trujillo State [together, the “Plants”]. The
Plants had the latest generation technology and exclusive equipment of OI’s group of affiliated
companies.*

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela

The Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, who acts through various government
agencies such as the Ministry of Science, Technology and Intermediate Industries [Ministerio del
Poder Popular para Sciencia, Tecnologia e Industrias Intermedias — “MINCIT”}; the Office of
the Attorney General of the Republic [Procuraduria General de la Repiblica — “PGR”]; the
Venezuelan Consumer Protection Agency [Instituto para la Defensa del Pueblo en al Acceso a
los Bienes y Servicios - “INDEPABIS”]; the National Institute of Occupational Prevention,
Health and Safety [Instituto Nacional de Prevencién Laboural, Salud y Seguridad —
“INPASASEL”); the C ission for the Administration of Currency h [Comision de
Administracién de Divisas - “CADIVI”]; and the National Customs and Tax Administration
Service [Servicio Nacional Integrado de Admiministracién Aduanera y Tributaria —“SENIAT”].

Venvidrio

In order to manage the industrial assets that originally belonged to the Companies and produce
and market glass containers, the Respondent, by Presidential Decree,’ created a company
assigned to the MINCIT: Venezolana del Vidrio, C.A. [“Venvidrio”]. Venvidrio was founded on
26 April 2011'° and assumed direct management of the Plants on 30 April 2011."

Pol

Inversiones Polar C.A. [“Polar”] is Venezuela’s main food sector group. In addition, it was a
minority shareholder and the main customer of the Companies.

CONTEXT PRIOR TO THE EXPROPRIATION

In late 2002, Venezuela was swept by intense protests and a general labor strike in the oil
industry. This strike spread to major food distributors and producers.

In view of these events, then-President Hugo Chavez created the Mercal mission, whose objective
was to create warehouses and supermarkets with low-cost staple foods and products. In addition,
the Ministry of Food was created in 2004.’

The Government also undertook reforms that included the establishment of a new exchange
control system and an expropriation law.

The exchange control system in Venezuela and CADIVI

With the aim of adopting measures designed to “achieve the stability of the currency, ensure the
continuity of the country’s international payments and counteract undesirable capital flight,”'> in
2003, Venezuela adopted an exchange control system and created an agency in charge of
approving transactions in foreign currency: CADIVI.’* Consequently, a company that wishes to
buy raw materials abroad, pay dividends to its shareholders or make any other transaction that
requires the conversion of Bolivars [“WEB”] into US Dollars [“USD”] must obtain the approval
of CADIVI.'*

In addition, CADIVI is tasked with authorizing, inter alia, the repatriation of international
investment capital; the remittal of international investment profits, earnings, and dividends; and
the compensation of international investors for the expropriation of international investment
dividends.'*

The V regulatory fi k for expropriations: the LECUPS

Since 2002, the forcible acquisition of rights and properties belonging to private persons in
Venezuela is regulated by the Law on Expropriation for Reasons of Public or Social Interest [Ley
de Expropiacién por Causa de Utilidad Piiblica 0 Social — “LECUPS”].'’ Given that this is a
crucial law for expropriation procedures, some of its most relevant characteristics are described
below.

Procedures under the LECUPS begin with an expropriation decree’* that requires a prior
declaration of public interest.'? This decree can only be enforced in two ways:

- voluntarily, through an amicable settlement, before the expropriation proceedings begin
or

- forcibly, authorized by the Judiciary.

With regard to the amicable settlement, this phase allows the parties to reach an agreement on the
valuation of the properties.” The owner has the opportunity to participate in the creation of an
appraisal commission consisting of three experts:

- one designated by the expropriating entity,
- one by the owner, and
- one named by the parties by mutual agreement”!

If an agreement on the value of the expropriated property is not reached, the amicable settlement
will come to an end and the expropriating entity may initiate a judicial procedure.”

If the amicable settlement is unsuccessful, the expropriating entity may resort to the courts to
request the expropriation of the property in question.”° The Court hearing the expropriation
request “shall order publication of the edict in which the presumed owners shall be summonsed
[....].™* After the party subject to expropriation presents its defense and an evidentiary hearing is
held, the Judge will make a decision on the merits of the case, but not on the amount. This
decision may be appealed before the Supreme Court of Justice.’ Once the Court declares the
need to acquire the property or right, the price will be settled based on the value established by
the previously desi; appraisal ission. If an agr is not reached, the Judge must
convene a second appraisal commission that will determine the fair price of the property.”° This
second appraisal may also be appealed before the Supreme Court of Justice. Once the appraisal is
final, the expropriating entity will deposit the amount with the Court hearing the case and the
property is formally handed over.””

There are two variations of the forcible enforcement authorized by the Judge:
- preliminary occupation, which may be allowed as a provisional remedy, and

- permanent occupation, which the Judge can only order after payment of the fair
compensation.

Occupation prior to the transfer of title is provided for by means of an emergency procedure and
is subject to the following requirements:

Public works declared to be “of public and social interest” based on Art. 14 must have been
declared a matter “of urgent implementation” by the expropriating entity in the text of the
expropriation Decree itself.”*

- The property must be valued by an appraisal commission for purposes of the preliminary
occupation, “which shall be ordered by the court with jurisdiction to hear the expropriation
proceedings, after the respective complaint is filed and provided the expropriating entity
states the amount determined to be the fair price of the property.”””

The Judge hearing the expropriation proceeding must notify the owner and the occupants.”

Before decreeing the preliminary occupation of the property, the Judge will order “notification
of the owner and the occupants, if any, in order to conduct a judicial inspection to leave record
of all factual circumstances that must be taken into account to set the amount of the fair
compensation for the property in question.”*!

Lastly, Article 52 of the LECUPS recognizes another occupation measure called “temporary
occupation.” This occupation is an administrative act that may be issued by the Administration to
perform specific activities with works declared to be of public interest, and cannot exceed six
months.

THE ORIGINS OF THE INVESTMENT

The origin of the Claimant’s presence in Venezuela dates back to the initial investments made by
the OI subsidiaries that created OldV and Favianca in 1956 and 1968, respectively (see paragraph
87). The Claimant acquired its direct shareholdings in these Companies on 31 December 2005
when it merged with Owens Illinois International B.V. a subsidiary of OI and the holder of those
shares.”

At the time of the expropriation, the Companies belonging to the Claimant were the leaders in the
Venezuelan glass container market.*? In the production process, they used the know-how,

and ij property ging to Owens Glass Container Inc.
[“OBGC”}], a subsidiary of OI, under a technology transfer agreement entered into with OBGC,
which stipulated the payment of substantial royalties.

The Los Guayos plant (operated by OldV) had six furnaces and 11 bottle molding machines.**
The Valera plant (operated by Favianca) had three furnaces and six molding machines.** In
addition, the Plants supplied their own electricity.” The efficiency of glass manufacturing plants
is typically measured by the “pack-to-melt” ratio they achieve.** The Plants operated at a ratio of
over 90%, which means that between the time [that the raw materials were melted] and the time
that the finished glass containers were packed for shipment, less than 10% of the volume was
lost—a very competitive result internationally.”

In addition to their advanced technology, the Plants had a highly qualified and specialized
workforce"

“Given the complexity and nature of the operations, they had the potential to be
dangerous if not properly carried out. That is why OldV and Favianca always placed
great emphasis on the proper training of the employees and on the implementation of
strict safety precautions at the plants.”*!

The Companies were glass suppliers in the Venezuelan market for major brands such as Heinz,
Kraft and Gerber, among others.” Its main customer was Polar, the major food sector group in
Venezuela.

The Companies were the only ones in the glass industry with majority foreign ownership.*®
THE EXPROPRIATION

The first news that the Bolivarian Republic intended to expropriate the Companies came out on
25 October 2010. There is no previous announcement or administrative act in the case record
pointing to this possibility. That evening, then-President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, made a
television broadcast announcing the expropriation of the Companies:

“The expropriation of that glass company, what’s it called?—Owens IIlinois!—is already all set.
Let it be expropriated. Elias [Jaua — Vice President of Venezuela], proceed.

lll. The next day, 26 October 2010, the Respondent issued Presidential Decree No. 7,751 [the
“Expropriation Decree”],’* formalizing the emergency forcible acquisition’*:

“(...) of the movable properties, real properties and improvements presumably owned by
the commercial company OWENS ILLINOIS DE VENEZUELA, C.A. used for the

D) Any other tangible assets forming part of the commercial company OWENS

112. | The “Whereas” Clauses of the Expropriation Decree made mention of the following facts:

- “that the company Owens Illinois has been engaged in practices that result in a violation
of the exercise of free competition, thus affecting other producers,

> that it is the duty of the State to adopt such measures as may be needed to prevent the
harmful and restrictive effects of the abuse of dominant position and other conducts that

indicates that the PGR will be in charge of handing the expropriation procedure provided for in
the LECUPS up to effective transfer of the ownership of the properties.”

few hours later, the workers arrived at the Plants and began protesting against the expropriation
outside the facilities.”

THE TRANSITION PERIOD

On 27 October 2010, MINCIT Minister Ricardo Menéndez, joined by Deputy Minister Yuri
Pimentel, met with OldV’s board of directors, represented by Messrs Enrique Machaen and Luis
Gémez at MINCIT headquarters in order to make a first attempt at contact following the
announcement of the measure:

“The Minister also explained how the Ministry wanted to proceed from that point on.
He did not expect the Ministry to take over management of the Plants immediately
and abruptly. Rather, at the same time the Ministry went about pursuing the legal
procedures for the eventual management and forced acquisition of the Plants’ assets,
OldV and its personnel would continue to operate the Plants as always, while the
Ministry would be limited to supervising OldV’s actions without interfering in its
operations, but would, as needed, provide OldV any support required by its
employees. To that end, supervisory bodies appointed by the Ministry would be set
up the following day and would also begin to organize the transition for managing
the Plants.”*”

During these exchanges, the Minister stated that “any measure taken in an attempt to stop the
Plants from operating would be considered an act of sabotage.”**

That same day, General Orlando Rodriguez of the GNB held a meeting with workers at the Los
Guayos plant. Given that the meeting was unsuccessful, the General called a meeting for that
same afternoon at the regional headquarters of the GNB.

Following this a transition period began, initially led by Deputy Minister Pimentel, who assumed
responsibility on a de facto basis® until January 2011 when responsibility was taken over by Mr.
Alejandro Sarmiento.”

The first objective was for the Plants to continue operating normally; Respondent therefore
decided that OldV and Favianca’s workers should continue to work at the facilities.’ The second
objective was for all of the knowledge and experience in managing and operating the Plants to be

“Operation Mirror” in the Plants, which consisted of forming a management team comprised of
five members of the work force, distinguishing the areas of priority and identifying certain
essential profiles. Each of these individuals was required to shadow the corresponding OldV
manager in order to acquire the necessary know-how for managing the Plants autonomously:

“Operation Mirror” consisted of designating “mirrors,” or people who would
work with us to learn our everyday duties. The objective of the “mirrors” was to
learn from us how to manage the operations of the Valera Plant in order to
guarantee that the plant operated normally.

The preventive occupation measure ordered by INDEPABIS

On 27 October 2010, INDEPABIS (the Venezuelan Consumer Protection Agency), went to

Favianca to “carry out [a] preventive temporary occupation measure.” The following day it

returned to Favianca “in order to appoint the Management Board that would oversee the

INDEPABIS also set up a temporary management board [“JAT”] for OldV in order to supervise

The provisional remedy ordered by the First Administrative Court

On 18 November 2010 the Office of the Attorney General filed a petition with the First
A ‘istrative Court for a provisi remedy isting of the ip ion and use of

the movable and immovable properties and improvements presumably owned by OldV and
Favianca.”!

 

On 20 December 2010, the First Administrative Court:

— ordered the requested provisional remedy in favor of Respondent for the occupation,
possession and use of the property owned by the Companies, and

- authorized the creation of an ad hoc management board [“ad hoc Management Board”],
designated by MINCIT, to manage, organize and oversee the Companies.”

MINCIT Resolution

As aresult of the Judgment handed down by the First Administrative Court, and by implementing
Article 8 of the Expropriation Decree, MINCIT issued Resolution No. 34 of 11 March 201 1.2
This resolution formed the ad hoc Management Board to manage “the companies OWENS
ILLINOIS DE VENEZUELA, S.A., the OWENS ILLINOIS DE VENEZUELA, C.A. plant and
FABRICA DE VIDRIOS LOS ANDES, C.A. (FAVINCA) [sic]” with Mr. Sarmiento as its
representative.” Article 2 of this resolution set forth the Board’s duties:

“The appointed board shall a the fundamental objective of directing
for and i of the abs

sale of glass containers for essential products. They are therefore empowered to

Ministry of People’s Power for Science, Technology and Intermediate Industries

Court orders of the Enforcement Courts

127. On 16 and 25 March 2011, respectively, the Enforcement Courts for the Los Guayos and Valera
municipalities:

— enforced the provisional remedy authorized by the First Administrative Court for the
occupation, possession and use of the Companies’ assets;

~ installed the ad hoc Management Board; and

— ordered that the Companies’ bank accounts could only be used with the express
authorization of the ad hoc Management Board.”

128. During the proceeding to enforce the provisional remedy, the representatives for OldV noted that
Oldv:

“is not a party to any judicial or administrative proceeding brought by the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in relation to the aforementioned expropriation
of assets. Owens Illinois de Venezuela C.A. is entitled to the benefit of legal
protection provided for both under Venezuelan law and international law
(through the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of
Investments between Venezuela and the Kingdom of the Netherlands).””°

129. Despite his estimate that the transition period would end at the end of March 2011,” Mr.
Sarmiento asked the Enforcement Courts for a 30-day extension for each Plant:

“[...] in order to inuity of inistrative and

procedures, the board orders a transition period of no greater than thirty (30)

consecutive days, for which it will instruct the representatives of [OldV and

Favianca, respectively] to do everything necessary to avoid a total or partial

shutdown of operations, as well as with respect to [continuing] payroll payments,

131. The transition period finally came to an end on 30 April 2011, when the Companies ceded control
to Venvidrio.

7 THE CREATION OF VENVIDRIO

132. On 5 April 2011, then President Chavez authorized the creation of Venvidrio, a State-owned
company affiliated with MINCIT, which would retain all the industrial assets previously owned
by the Companies and take charge of the production and sale of glass containers.”

133.  Venvidrio, with Mr. Sarmiento as President,’ directly took over management of the Plants on
30 April 2011, bringing the transition period to a close: at that time, the formation of the new
boards of directors had been completed and the process of employer substitution for the workers
(who were transferred over to Venvidrio’s payroll) ®* had been finalized.

134. | Once Venvidrio had been formed and a bank account had been opened in its name, Respondent
requested that the Companies transfer all available cash funds into Venvidrio’s account. After
informing Respondent about the bank accounts that were held in their name and the balances
available at the time in those accounts, the Companies transferred all of their cash to
Venvidrio’s account.**

8. EXPROPRIATION PROCEDURE

135. The formal transfer of ownership of the Companies’ assets is still pending, because the
expropriation procedure under the LECUPS continues its course in the Venezuelan courts and a
final decision has not been handed down to date.*”

136. The Office of the Attorney General commenced the amicable settlement phase provided for under
the LECUPS in late 2010 and proposed that the parties sign an Official Record of

Cc of Amicabl I on 17 ber 2010.8 Shortly thereafter, on 9
December 2010, OldV wrote to Minister Menéndez informing him that the Companies:

 

“would not participate in the expropriation procedures initiated by the Office of
the Attorney General of the Republic or sign the proposed official record for
purposes of said procedures because they disagree with its terms.” ”

OldV also contended that fair compensation should be determined based on the provisions of the
BIT.”

In view of the fact that the parties were unable to reach an amicable agreement, on 14 March
2011, the Office of the Attorney General initiated a legal procedure under the LECUPS, filing an
expropriation petition with the First and Second Administrative Courts requesting:

“the expropriation of the movable and immovable properties belonging to the
commercial companies OWENS ILLINOIS DE VENEZUELA, C.A. and
FABRICA DE VIDRIOS LOS ANDES, C.V. (FAVIANCA).””

On 5 April 2011, the same day that Venvidrio was created, the Fact-Finding Panel of the Supreme
Court of Justice issued a decision in which it admitted the expropriation petition filed by the
Office of the Attorney General and ordered that notice be served to the owners of the Companies
so that the respective judicial inspections could be conducted.”

The expropriation proceeding was subsequently joined with the case involving the provisional
remedy that had been authorized by the First Administrative Court.* Currently, the Second
Administrative Court is still hearing the expropriation proceedings.”®

OTHER EVENTS OCCURRING AT THE TIME OF THE EXPROPRIATION

investigation and imposed on Claimant requirements for improving certain health and safety
measures.

Specifically, on 22 and 23 November 2010, INPSASEL conducted an inspection in the Los
Guayas plant to determine whether OldV had met certain requirements that had been previously
imposed.” INPSASEL’s reports showed specific irregularities that OldV had failed to correct. On
25 August 2011, a report proposing sanctions was issued and on August 30, 2011
INPSASEL initiated a sanctions proceeding against OldV due to the alleged commission of
five violations of the Organic Law on Prevention, Working Conditions and the Work
Environment [“LOPCYMAT").”

OldV responded on 16 September 2011, denying any accusation and requesting the proposed fine
be dismissed.”

Finally, on 28 February 2012, INPSASEL issued an administrative decision indicating that OldV
had not complied with certain provisions of the LOPCYMAT, and imposing a fine of VEB
10,988,550 for such violation.’

Envidrio’s report

In order to carry out audits that would allow the Plants’ conditions to be verified and to obtain
help for its management, Respondent sought the assistance of Envidrio, a Uruguayan glass
producer.'*! Envidrio accessed the Plants and issued a preliminary status report in January 2011
[“Envidrio Preliminary Report”].'° Envidrio’s presence at the Plants was strongly opposed by
OldV, who perceived its “technology, technical procedures and know-how to be under threat.” '°°

Technology into [the Plant].'°*

147. Some months after the Transition Period ended, Venvidrio signed a cooperation agreement with
Envidrio, the primary objective of which was to create the Strategic Alliance of Glass Companies
[“Alenvidrio”):'°°

“Under the framework of Alenvidrio, Venvidrio and Envidrio have planned the
eventual construction of a glass production plant in the Brazilian state of Rio

Americas [“Ambev”]'°® with its sights sets on a possible collaboration, specifically the joint
construction of a plant in Brazil.’ Venvidrio carried out certain glass exports to Brazil.'!°

Difficulties with CADIVI

currency for distribution of the dividends declared in May 2008, November 2008 and June
2009.''! Two years later, on 8 September 2011, CADIVI denied the three requests, concluding
that the dividends referred to in the request had already been paid to the Companies’
shareholders.'"? This prevented the Companies from being able to transfer dividend payments to
Claimant at the exchange rate set by the government.’ Claimant used the parallel foreign
currency market—with a higher exchange rate than the official rate—to take the dividends out of

compensation due.!!”

At the meeting on 17 March 2011, Claimant presented an appraisal for somewhat over USD 1
billion for 100% of the Companies.'"* At the following meeting on 11 July 2011, Respondent
made a counter-offer of USD 100-120 million,'’ contending that the appraisal was based on a

ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25

Vv. JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS

Respondent has put forward two objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. (1.) First, it claims
that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear this dispute on the basis that Claimant has failed to
prove the existence of an investment under the terms set forth in Article 1(a) of the BIT and
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. (2.) Second, Respondent alleges that the Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction to hear claims for damage to Claimant’s business outside of Venezuela.

On the other hand, Claimant believes the Tribunal does in fact have jurisdiction to hear this
dispute, based on its having proven the existence of an investment pursuant to Article 1(a) of the
BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, Claimant submits that the Tribunal
must consider damage to Claimant’s business outside of Venezuela as a background matter and,
accordingly, must dismiss the second jurisdictional objection put forward by Respondent.

NONEXISTENCE OF THE INVESTMENT
Respondent’s position

In its pleadings, Respondent has argued that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction, claiming that the
requirement for an investment to exist has not been met under both Article 1(a) of the BIT and
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Respondent claims that the term “investment”

- (a) has an inherent and objective meaning,
- (b) requires that a contribution be made,

- (c) Article 1 of the Venezuela-Netherlands BIT does not negate the inherent and
objective meaning of the term “investment.”

Respondent further alleges that OIEG (d) has made no contribution whatsoever for its investment
and that (e) there is already a proceeding with the very same object, which prevents the Tribunal
from hearing this case.

a. The term “investment” has an inherent and objective meaning

Convention,'?> which meaning entails making a contribution.'*

According to Respondent, this principle is also applicable to treaties—such as the Venezuela-
Netherlands BIT—that contain a non-exhaustive definition of the term “investment” based on a
classification of assets.'”* The expression “every kind of asset” contained in Article 1(a) of the
BIT cannot include all conceivable investments, particularly if the object and purpose set forth in
the Preamble of the BIT is taken into consideration.'°

Respondent strongly opposes a literal reading of Article 1(a) of the BIT, which based on its
understanding Claimant relies on, as it asserts that it violates Article 31 of the Vienna Convention
on the Law of Treaties [“VCLT”].'”” Respondent contends that Article 31(3) of the VCLT also
favors an objective and intrinsic interpretation of the term “investment” in Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention.’

Respondent finds Claimant’s arguments that would attempt to deny the existence of an objective
and intrinsic definition of the term “investment” to be irrelevant and flawed.'? The main
arguments Respondent relies on to refute Claimant’s objections are noted in the paragraphs
below.

First, Respondent denies that the definition of investment set forth in the BIT determines the
scope of jurisdiction referred to under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention,'®’ and advocates for
the application of the double keyhole test,'°' aimed at determining

= whether the activity in question is covered by the parties’ agreement and

— whether it meets the requirements of the ICSID Convention.'**

Second, Respondent submits that a literal interpretation of Article 1(a) of the BIT conflicts with
Article 31 of the VCLT, as it does not take into account the Preamble of the BIT, which
Respondent recognizes as its object and purpose, and therefore cannot be considered to be a
good-faith interpretation.'** Respondent insists that interpreting Article 1(a) of the BIT by
adhering to the current meaning that ought to be attributed to the term “investment” is the same as

interpreting the term according to its objective and inherent meaning.’ And, although it accepts
that Claimant’s investment is included under a literal reading of Article 1(a) of the BIT,'*> it
asserts that both the literal and historical interpretation lead to an absurd interpretation that all
assets are considered investments.'*

Finally, Respondent submits that what is truly important is not to determine whether ownership of
the assets constitutes an investment, per se, but whether in this case Claimant’s merely passive
holding of shares, without having made a contribution, amounts to an investment.'*” To support
its position, Respondent relies on several awards, and specifically on Malicorp.'**

b. The _inherent_and_objective_meaning of the term “investment” requires_a
contribution as a sine qua non

Respondent alleges that the inherent and objective meaning of the term “investment” requires a
contribution as a sine qua non, which Claimant did not, in its view, make. According to
Respondent, this fundamental principle has been confirmed by several tribunals in their analysis
of the Convention and bilateral investment treaties,'*° regardless of whether they used the
intuitive or deductive method to define the concept of investment.'*°

Respondent claims that Claimant has not met the sine qua non requiring a contribution and
therefore an investment does not exist, which in turn implies that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to
hear this dispute. Respondent recommends that the Tribunal take its lead from the decision in the
KT Asia case, which establishes that the lack of a contribution is enough for the tribunal to reject
jurisdiction over the dispute.'*!

c Article 1 of the Venezuela-Netherlands BIT does not negate the inherent and
objective meaning of the term “investment”

Respondent contends that Article 1 of the Venezuela-Netherlands BIT does not negate the
inherent and objective meaning of the term “investment,” which requires that a contribution be
made as a sine qua non.” Following the reasoning in the KT Asia award, Respondent alleges that

— “of the [investor]” and

— “investments made”

order for an investment to exist.’**

d. Claimant has made no contril

 

Respondent argues that Claimant has failed to prove that it made any contribution to acquire its
shares in OldV, and that an investment therefore does not, legally speaking, exist.'**

Respondent submits as a counter-argument to Claimant's allegations that:

First, Respondent rejects Claimant’s argument contending that it is the “investment” that must
“contribute,” as it finds this to be a flawed interpretation of the contribution requirement.“

Second. Respondent believes that the contributions Claimant alleges it has made (through its
control of the reinvestment of retained profits through contributions made by the predecessor
shareholders of OldV or by taking on liabilities in the form of the predecessor shareholders’
debts) are not in keeping with modern case law, are factually erroneous and must be rejected by
the Tribunal.'*”

= it cannot be accepted that Claimant made a contribution through its own inaction; in other
words, through the decision not to take benefits from OldV. Such benefits belong to
OldV and Favianca, not to Claimant, a situation that could be looked at differently had
dividends been distributed and had Claimant reinvested such dividends in OldV, which
did not occur;'**

Claimant’s non-Dutch predecessors would be irrelevant for purposes of determining
150

jurisdiction;

- the liabilities assumed by OJEG in the merger, through which it acquired OldV’s shares,
would amount to nothing more than financial engineering and could not be considered
commitments or contributions for acquiring an investment;'*' moreover, the debt has
allegedly not been paid and the mere holding of assets, without a contribution, has been
rejected by the tribunals in Quiborax and KT Asia.'*

Finally, Respondent deems any of Claimant’s shares in OldV and Favianca that were registered
in the Direct Foreign Investment Registry as irrelevant, on the grounds that:'**

= the mere registration has no bearing on establishing whether an investment was made,

ad it cannot be considered an acknowledgment that Claimant has made an investment under
the terms of Article 1(a) of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and

i registration only has any effect in the internal legal system.

As such, Respondent submits that Claimant has failed to prove that it made it any contribution for
its investment. Pursuant to the objective and inherent meaning of the term “investment”
established in Article 1(a) of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, Claimant would
not have an investment, and therefore, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide the case.

d. The existence of a proceeding with the same object

Respondent has informed the Tribunal of the existence of another investment arbitration filed by
Favianca and OldV against Venezuela (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/21), in its letter dated 27
November 2012. Although the Tribunal denied Respondent’s request to suspend this arbitration
in its letter of 30 November 2012, it left open the possibility that the parties might in the future
request a procedure to assess the possible consequences of the parallel proceeding.

In its Preliminary Objections, Respondent insisted on reserving all rights accorded to it with
regard to the initiation of the parallel proceeding and its impact on the present dispute.
Nevertheless, Respondent has not re-invoked ICSID Case No. ARB/12/21 in this proceeding.

Claimant’s position

Claimant submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the claims put forward in this
proceeding. First, Claimant insists that its investments comply with the definition of “investment”
under both (a) Article 1(a) of the BIT and (b) Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Secondly,
and regardless of the applicable legal definitions, Claimant argues that it has proven that (c) it did
make an investment in Venezuela.

a. Claimant made an investment pursuant to Article 1(a) of the BIT

Claimant asserts that Respondent’s objections that OIEG did not make an “investment” because it
has not made a “contribution” must be rejected:

= first, because they are not supported by the language of the BIT, and

- second, because case law does not require a shareholder to “make” a “contribution,”
given that Article 1(a) of the BIT considers that the rights derived from ownership of the
shares are an “investment.”

Claimant contends that an orthodox application of the principles governing the interpretation of

international treaties leaves no doubt that Claimant’s investments in Venezuela are covered by

Article 1(a) of the BIT.'* In particular, Claimant argues that its investments constitute:'**

- assets in the form of shares in OldV and Favianca pursuant to the chapeau in Article 1(a)
of the BIT,

- the rights derived from ownership of such shares pursuant to Article 1(a)(ii) of the BIT,
and

- its stake as a majority shareholder in the movable and immovable property of OldV and
Favianca under Article 1(a)(i) of the BIT.

OIEG therefore contends that Respondent’s attempt to distort the clear language and scope of
Article 1(a) must be rejected by the Tribunal.'*°

Claimant asserts that current case law'®’ does not require a shareholder to “make” a
“contribution” in order for its investment to be valid under Article 1(a) of the BIT.'*

Furthermore, Claimant relies on Mobil," Inmaris,'® Saluka,'*! and Mytilenos'® to:

- reinforce its argument that the definition of “investment” under a bilateral investment
treaty does not implicitly require that an investment be made as a sine qua non, except in

163,

the case of an explicit requirement, °° and

= to distinguish between making payments that could be considered a “contribution” and
the existence of “shares,” that in and of themselves constitute an investment and are the

basis on which jurisdiction is established.’

181. | Claimant refers to the decision by the tribunal in CME to reject Respondent’s argument that in
order for the acquisition of shares by a predecessor to be considered an “investment,” it is
necessary for the investor to have made a contribution, regardless of the fact that the companies

acquired did not need a contribution given their success and profitability.'

182. In addition, Claimant asserts that any possible requirement with regard to making a contribution

can only be related to an “investment” and not the “investor,”'

cited by Respondent such as Deutsche Bank, Ulysseas and Caratube.'®"

which argument relies on cases

183. Finally, Claimant relies on numerous decisions by arbitral tribunals'®* based on bilateral
investment treaties and the ICSID Convention to support the position that possessing shares is, in

itself, an “investment” in accordance with Article 1(a) of the BIT.'©?

184. Claimant contends that given the lack of evidence provided by Respondent of the need to “make”
a “contribution” in order for an “investment” to exist, the Tribunal must assert its jurisdiction,
without the need to examine the existence of an “investment” under Article 25(1) of the ICSID

Convention.'” It is the definition of investment under the BIT that determines and controls the

meaning of the term “investment” in the ICSID Convention.’
b. Claimant has satisfied all additional requirements for establishing an “investment”

under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention

Claimant denies the existence of a strict “double keyhole test” that according to Respondent is
necessary to confirm the existence of an “investment” under both Article 25(1) of the Convention
and under the BIT.’ Moreover, even if the ICSID Convention did impose any sort of additional

qui to di ine the exi of an “ii .” Claimant claims to have complied
with such requirement.!”?

 

First, Claimant reiterates that Venezuela’s argument that Article 25(1) of the Convention requires
that a “contribution” be “made” in order for an “investment” to exist is groundless,'” especially
given the history of the drafting of the Convention.'

OIEG argues that, unlike the strict interpretation of the criteria to determine an “investment” in
the Salini case,'” more recent decisions of arbitral tribunals!’ confirm that the characteristics of
an “investment,” which can be a “contribution,” are not jurisdictional requirements, but are at
best “characteristics.” Furthermore, any analysis of such “characteristics” inherent in an
“investment” must be comprehensive and take into account the specific circumstances of the
case.'78

In addition, Claimant contends that case law confirms that Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention
“must not be subject to an unduly restrictive interpretation”! and that a tribunal must have
“[very] compelling reasons”'® to set aside the definition of investment agreed by the parties in
the BIT.'*!

Therefore, Claimant submits that Respondent’s insistence that a “contribution” must be “made”
as a jurisdictional requirement under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention has no basis under
Law, and reiterates that there can be no doubt that holding shares is an investment.'* It therefore

case do not correspond to this case."

c Claimant made an “investment” in Venezuela

Claimant contends that Respondent has invented a sine gua non requirement in order for
jurisdiction to exist: that a contribution must be made.'® In Claimant’s view, Respondent has not
been able to explain what the requirement for such contribution would consist of, given that such
jurisdictional requirement does not actually exist.'** Given that Claimant and its investments have
made various contributions, Respondent would be forced to seek out a sufficiently limited
definition of contribution to exclude all such investments.’

Claimant argues that it has proven that it has allocated numerous “economically valuable
resources”'*” to OldV and Favianca, as majority and controlling shareholder'** of certain
companies that operate large industrial facilities, generate significant production and cash flow

and pay significant amounts of taxes in Venezuela,'* and also, more specifically, by:

~ _ reinvesting profits retained in the Companies,'*'
— assuming the debts of Claimant’s predecessor shareholders in OldV and Favianca,'”

= making p: through its pred shareholders of capital i in OldV and
Favianca.'*°

 

In summary, Claimant submits that even if the Tribunal were to find that there is a sine qua non
requirement to make a contribution, it is clear that OIEG has met that requirement.!* Claimant
therefore asks the Tribunal to dismiss Respondent’s first jurisdictional objection.

The Analysis of the Tribunal

In its first objection, the Bolivarian Republic denies that the Claimant is the owner of a protected
investment in Venezuela. It submits that, in order for an investment to exist, it is not sufficient
that the shares be listed in Art. 1(a) of the BIT, but rather that it is essential that the investor have
made a contribution. OIEG never made a contribution of its own, since it acquired its interests in
the Companies in a corporate restructuring—the only contribution was made by other companies
of the OI group, predecessors of OIEG; and the Claimant could not benefit from it.'**

The Claimant holds the opposite view: it is the owner of shares that confer control over two large
glass-producing companies in Venezuela; the contribution exists and was made by the companies
of the OI Group from which it acquired the shares; and it is not necessary that each successive
investment holder make a new contribution.'** OIEG adds that, even assuming arguendo that the
opposite position were accepted, it would also have met the requirement; since it has reinvested
undistributed profits generated by the Companies and has assumed financial obligations of its
predecessor amounting to more than US$100 million.

In order to resolve this dispute, the Tribunal will first (a) establish the proven facts, then (b) set
out the law, (c) define the concept of investment and, finally, (d) analyze the counter-arguments
of the Respondent.

a. Proven facts

The OI group’s investment in Venezuela dates back to the middle of the 20" century: OldV was
organized in 1958 and Favianca in 1968.

OldV

At the time of the organization of OldV in 1958, Owens Illinois of Panama S.A. contributed Bs.
9,400 and acquired 94%.'°” Since then, OldV has been controlled continuously by companies of
the OI group and has been engaged very actively in business, operating a large plant for the
manufacture of glass.'"* It is undisputed that, both at the time of its organization and on
subsequent occasions, companies of the OI group made the necessary contributions of capital, of
technology and of know-how to permit the development of its manufacturing and business
activities.

OIEG, the Claimant here, was founded in 1999 in Holland and from its creation until today has
been 100% owned by the OI group. It has acted—directly or through affiliates—as a holding

company for the shares of the group. At least since 2002, OIEG has owned—among many other

The history of the holding of the interest in Favianca is similar. In 1973, OldV acquired an
interest in Favianca; and in 1982 it capitalized reserves until its interest reached 70%.' Since
that time, Favianca has always been controlled by the OJ Group, has engaged in the
manufacturing of glass containers and has been the recipient of multiple contributions of capital,
technology and know-how.

In 2002, Owens Illinois International B.V.—the Dutch company holding the interest in OldV—
also acquired a 32% interest in Favianca and did so in the same corporate transaction (the
liquidation of OIV Holding C.A.).

Since 2002, the shares that are the subject of this litigation, the 73.97% of OldV and the 32% of
Favianca, are controlled through a Dutch company of the OI group.”

Simplification of the Dutch Structure

In late 2005, the OI group decided—for reasons that are not in the record—to merge its
subsidiaries OIEG and Owen[s]-Illinois International B.V. The merger was accomplished as

follows:”"

OIEG was the surviving company;

Owens Illinois International B.V.”” was the absorbed company and was terminated;

Owens Illinois International B.V. made a general transfer of all of its assets and liabilities to the
surviving company, OIEG; among the assets were the interests in OldV and in Favianca, which

became the property of the surviving company;

Since OIEG now owned 100% of the capital of the absorbed companies, there was no need to
increase its capital.

In summary: OldV and Favianca, the two Venezuelan Companies that are the subject of this
litigation, have been part of the OI group since their organization in the mid-twentieth century. In
2002 the OI group already owned the Venezuelan shares through OIEG, the Dutch company that
is the Claimant here. It happened, however, that the control was indirect, by way of a second
company, also Dutch, a 100%-owned subsidiary named Owen-IIlinois International B.V.

In late 2005, OI made the decision to simplify the chain of ownership. To this end, it decided that
the 100%-owned subsidiary would be merged into its parent company. Thus, Owen-lllinois
International B.V. was terminated; and OIEG succeeded to direct ownership of the OldV and
Favianca shares (shares that it already controlled).

Reserves 2006-2009

During the 2006-2009 fiscal years, OldV and Favianca continued their business activities in
Venezuela and generated significant earnings, distributing a portion in the form of dividends,
with the rest remaining in both companies as undistributed reserves. The Claimant has confirmed,
203 and the Respondent has not questioned, that the total amount of such additional reserves
created during those four fiscal years (reduced by dividends paid) reached nearly US$100 million,
of which approximately US$73 million corresponded to OIEG.

b. Applicable law

Investments protected by the BIT are defined in Article 1(a), which states as follows:

“For purposes of this Agreement:

a) The term “investments” shall include all types of assets, including without limitation:

(i) _ Real and personal property, as well as any other rights in rem in all types of assets;

(ii) Rights arising from shares of stock, bonds and other forms of interest in companies and
joint ventures;

(iii) Ownership interests in cash, other assets and any other benefit having economic value;
(iv) Rights in intellectual property, technical processes, goodwill, and know-how:

(vy) Rights granted under public law, including rights to prospect, explore, extract, and
exploit natural resources.”

OI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

The BIT contains a very broad notion of “investments”: it defines them by reference to “all types
of assets,” and then offers a non-exhaustive list of certain classes of assets that in all events would
constitute investments.

Both parties accept that the shares that the OI group held in OldV and Favianca are contemplated
in this list:

- On the one hand they are “real and personal property” [protected by paragraph (i)] and

- On the other they are “rights arising from shares of shock . . . in companies” [protected by
paragraph (ii)]."*

Prima facie it would appear thus indisputable that the shares of OldV and Favianca ought to be

considered as investments protected by the BIT. However, the difficulties arise from Article 25 of

the Convention, which mandates the following:

“The Centre’s jurisdiction shall extend to disputes of a legal nature that arise directly

from_an_ investment between a Contracting State . . . and the citizen of another
Contracting State and which the parties have agreed in writing to submit to the Centre.
(.32"

The Bolivarian Republic argues that the term “investment,” as it is used in Article 25 of the
Convention, has an intrinsic and objective meaning and that this meaning requires as a condition
sine qua non that the investor have made a contribution—since Article 1 of the BIT did not, nor
can it, negate this requirement. On the contrary: the Republic argues that Article 1 of the BIT
even assumes the same intrinsic and objective definition of investment that emerges from Article
25 of the Convention. In the instant case, the Respondent[sic] itself did not make any
contribution; it cannot benefit from the contributions made by its predecessors; and therefore it is
not the owner of a protected investment.

¢. The Concept of Investment

Respondent’s objection raises one of the quaestiones vexatae of investment arbitration: the
concept of the protected investment. And more precisely: what occurs when States include very
broad definitions of the concept of investment in their treaties and agree to have all disputes with
investors resolved through ICSID arbitration? How does this practice find a balance with the
requirement contained in Article 25 of the Convention, which restricts the Centre’s jurisdiction to
“any legal dispute” that arises “directly out of an investment”?

This difficulty is exacerbated because the Convention does not include a definition of the concept
of investment. This was a decision made consciously by its drafters; a very generic definition was
included in the first version of the text (“any contribution of money or other assets of economic
value for an indefinite period, or...not less than five years”), but was abandoned due to lack of

agreement. Ultimately, the decision was made to leave the Convention totally devoid of any
definition as to what one should understand by investment.”°

The parties have argued at great length about the requirements of Article 25 of the Convention
and its relationship with Article 1(a) of the BIT concerning the existence of an objective and
inherent concept of investment, about the need for the investor to have made a contribution, about
the characteristics such contribution must have and if it is enforceable for the investment or the
investor.

Does an objective and inherent concept of investment exist?

The first question to decide is whether a unique, objective and inherent concept of investment
exists.

The Tribunal agrees with the Bolivarian Republic that the concept of “investment” used in Article
25(1) of the Convention does have an objective and inherent meaning?” The Centre’s
jurisdiction has certain limits that cannot be breached, that States cannot overstep. Disputes
submitted to ICSID arbitration must be legal in nature and must “aris[e] directly out of an
investment.” States are given the latitude to define the concept of investment, but they cannot
distort it. They cannot make an investment dispute out of something that by all accounts lacks this
nature.

In this case the States have delimited the investments they wish to protect in Article 1(a) of the
BIT, and they have done so broadly, agreeing that the term “investment” shall comprise every
kind of asset, and then offering a non-exhaustive list of examples articulated around five
categories:

— Moveable and immoveable property,

— Investments in companies and joint-ventures,

— Credit rights,

— Industrial or intellectual property,

- Government concessions.
Not all assets, based on the simple fact that they are included in the non-exhaustive list of

examples, constitute an investment. Such assets must be a true investment in order to meet the
objective and inherent characteristic of all investments. To provide an example that will lend

clarity to the question: think about a citizen of a foreign country who is entitled to collect a
pension. The pensioner’s credit right could be understood as something that would fall under the
third category of the assets mentioned in Article 1(a) of the BIT.” However, the right to receive
a pension does not itute an i and dingly should not be d as being
included under the BIT’s scope of protection, or within the scope of jurisdiction of ICSID
arbitration, as defined by Article 25(1) of the Convention.

Having set forth this conclusion, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant”"” in that States enjoy wide
discretion to define which investments they wish to protect through a BIT and that Article 25(1)
of the Convention should not be subject to a restrictive interpretation. If two States have included
a certain asset within a list of investments, a tribunal should only exclude it if it fails to meet the
requirements of the objective and inherent concept of investment, if there is a compelling reason
to do so!"

This interpretation is reinforced by the way the historical negotiations leading up to the adoption
of the Convention in its current form took place. Although the negotiating parties failed to reach
an agreement on a definition of the concept of investment, the solution they chose was to omit it
from Article 25(1), and compensate for this liberal concession with the introduction of Article
25(4), a provision that was absent in the first versions, and that allows States to restrict the
Centre’s ratione materiae jurisdiction to certain financial transactions and assets through a simple
notice.””? The Bolivarian Republic has not availed itself of this option.”"?

Delimitation of the concept
What then, does that objective and inherent concept of the term “investment” entail?

An unequivocal answer is elusive given that “investment” is not a legal concept, but an economic
process that may encompass very diverse legal realities—ranging from the ownership of property
or a stock portfolio to control of a company, to a utilities concession agreement. The Law
provides for and has the capacity to define obligations, credit rights, legal transactions, securities,
contracts, ownership, possession—it is even able to delimit the concept of business. Yet the Law
is of little help in defining a complex and economic process such as carrying out an investment."
All a legal scholar can aspire to do is establish a catalogue of characteristics that would prove

to be of some assistance in the task of discerning whether or not an asset, in a specific situation,
fits within the economic category.”!*

223. It is essential in this task to make a preliminary classification within the generic concept of
investment based on the asset chosen, as there is a paradigmatic and clearly varied category of
assets that leaves no room for doubt, while uncertainty remains with regard to the other types of
assets.

Types of assets

224. The most common category of investments are in corporate assets, i.e., situations in which the
foreign investor is the corporate owner of an enterprise located in the receiving State (enterprise
should be interpreted as any organization having capital and labor that produces goods or services
to be placed on the market); this alternative, frequently referred to as direct investment, can be
formalized either by creating a branch office, or controlling a company created in the destination
country, which is the entity that in turn engages in the corporate activity.

225. The second category is comprised of all other assets, those which do not give the investor any
ownership of an enterprise in the destination country. Situations within this group can be highly
varied in nature. In investment case law, conflicts typically arise when the purported investor has
executed contracts with the receiving State—for construction,”"* services,””” supply of goods—or
holds negotiable instruments issued by the State itself.?"*

Application to this case

226. The first category, corporate assets, represents the paradigm of investors that deserve protection
and are unquestionably included under both the BIT and the Convention.

715 There are different lists of characteristics typical of investments, like the one in Salini, para. 52, and the one in C.
Schreuer, (vide: “The ICSID Convention,” 2™ edition, p. 158). In a nutshell, the required characteristics are
contribution, duration and risk (see Quiborax, para. 219). It is important to clarify that the required characteristics
are merely guidelines: it is possible for an asset to be an investment even when it does not meet all the
characteristics, and vice versa.

It is doubtful that the characteristics have the same meaning in different types of investment; thus, for instance, the
tisk in a corporate investment is the possibility of obtaining benefits or incurring losses, while in an investment in
public debt the risk is that the State will not pay—by all accounts two very different uncertainties. And the
requirement of a contribution, as understood in a corporate asset, makes little sense in other assets such as public
debt or corporate obligations.

The Salini test was designed to discern whether or not a construction contract constitutes an asset. Its usefulness in
other situations is doubtful. For difficulties in applying the Salini test to public debt see Ambiente Ufficio, para. 482.

ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

Indeed, the second paragraph of Article 1(a) of the BIT includes among the protected assets
“shares...and other kinds of interests in companies.”

And corporate assets also include, by their very nature, investments for purposes of Article 25(1)
of the Convention. The ICSID Convention was enacted precisely to promote and protect these
types of investments. The Preamble of the Convention invokes, as the first justification for the
Treaty, the need for “international cooperation for economic development.” The creation of a
local company by a foreign investor is precisely the most direct and immediate way to favor
economic development in the receiving State. The foreign investor contributes money, goods or
industry, creates an ization in the ination country, iP pays taxes,
introduces goods or services to the local market—all of which are wealth-creating activities.

 

Conclusion

Article 25(1) of the Convention defines those disputes that may gain access to ICSID arbitration
and does so by requiring that such disputes “aris[e] directly out of an investment.” The concept of
investment utilized in that provision has an objective and inherent meaning that States cannot
distort by classifying as investments those relationships that do not meet the necessary
requirements.

The scope and characteristics of the objective and inherent concept of investment are open to
debate, and whether certain uncommon assets are part of this or not: it is legitimate to ask
whether a mere sales agreement, or the acquisition of a corporate obligation, or simply owning an
apartment for weekend use meet the objective and inherent i in order to be

an investment.

The same question cannot be posed with regard to corporate assets located in the destination
country, and especially if the foreign investor manages the company. The acquisition and holding
of this type of asset represents the quintessential investment, and, by nature, complies with the
objective and inherent requirements of an investment. Consequently, there is nothing preventing
two States that are negotiating a BIT and want to define the scope of protection from including
them in the assets protected. If they do so, as have the Bolivarian Republic and the Netherlands,
they cannot be deemed in any way to be distorting the concept of investment or violating Article
25(1) of the Convention.

In this arbitration, OIEG, through its controlling shares in OIdV and Favianca, owns corporate
assets located in Venezuela, consisting of two large glass manufacturing plants, and has managed
these at least since 2002.7" Assets such as these, expressly included in the list contained in the
BIT, also comply, by their very nature, with the requirements of Article 25(1) of the Convention.
The purpose and aim of the BIT and the Convention are to promote economic development and
wealth creation in the destination country. Corporate investments in which the foreign investor

contributes money or goods to create or acquire a company, manages it with its own technology
and maintains its ownership for a long period of time, are those that most clearly contribute so
that such purpose and aim may be achieved.

d. Counterargument of the Bolivarian Republic

Respondent alleges in contrast to this conclusion that OIEG has not made any contribution
whatsoever: it allegedly acquired the shares in the Venezuelan Companies through a restructuring
completed in 2005, to which no contribution was made, and has failed to make any contribution
since that date,

The Tribunal does not share this view.

The existence of a contribution by the foreign investor in the form of a monetary contribution,
goods or industry, constitutes one of the characteristics that, as a general rule, assets must meet in
order to be classified as investments.”° The Tribunal is willing to accept that in a case such as
this one, in which OIEG claims to be the owner of corporate assets in Venezuela, this requirement
could be relevant: the ownership of corporate assets in the destination country requires the foreign
investor to have made some contribution, at least at the very beginning, when the company
started operating or made the acquisition.

Yet the Tribunal harbors no doubt that OIEG, hic et nunc, has more than complied with that
requirement.

Cash Contribution

The most common way for a foreign investor to contribute to the company in the destination
country is by means of a cash contribution.

It is indisputable that the Ol group, from the formation of the Companies in the last century, has
made several cash contributions. It would thus seem that the requirement is met.

The Bolivarian Republic, however, argues that OIEG, which has separate legal status and Dutch
citizenship, and invokes it to benefit from the BIT, may not benefit from the contributions made
by other companies in the group, which lack those characteristics, before OIEG became the
owner of the shares,”*!

It is not necessary for the Tribunal to address this argument brought by the Respondent, since
even if it accepted for the sake of argument that the contributions made by previous owners do
not qualify (a matter that the Tribunal does not address), it is a fact that OIEG has also made its

Award

own cash contributions after its acquisition of the Venezuelan Companies.

Indeed, during fiscal years 2006-2009 OIEG has provided cash to the companies, when it did not
withdraw part of the profits generated, and allowed them to be kept as reserves. The total amount
retained (excluding the dividends paid to shareholders) amounts to almost USD 100 million, of
which USD 73 million correspond to O[EG. When a shareholder decides not to collect profits in
full, but to leave them—in whole or in part—with the company, it is waiving a right and making a
contribution of cash to the company, which is enriched to the extent of the amount that the
shareholder relinquished.

It is true that the funds provided by the foreign investor to Venezuelan Companies would have
been generated in the destination country itself. But this is irrelevant:

- first, because there is no requirement that the funds be of foreign origin;””

- and also, because the investor could have repatriated the dividends, since the BIT grants it the
tight to do so, in order to immediately reinvest them in the company; all that has happened is
that both cash flows have been compensated.

The Respondent also raises one last argument: OIEG could not have made a contribution by
means of its own inaction—that is, by not withdrawing the profits generated in the form of
dividends.”

The argument is not persuasive: it is not true that the investor has remained inactive. The creation
of a reserve requires an agreement of the company’s governing bodies, controlled by the OIEG,
in which it decides to distribute only part of the profits, and apply the rest to reserves.

Contribution of Effort

In addition, OIEG has been making, since becoming the owner of the investment, a contribution
in the form of effort: the management of Venezuelan Companies. This is not an insignificant
contribution, since one of the main goals that is sought with foreign investment is to improve the
management skills of domestic companies.

In this case, OIEG has been managing OldV and Favianca since 2002, first indirectly through its
subsidiary Owens Illinois International B.V., and directly since 2005. This management activity
has been made by participating and voting in shareholders’ meetings, and appointing directors
and managers of the Companies. The results have been very successful: under the management

of OIEG, the Venezuelan Companies have expanded their activity, increased the employment
they offer, and expanded their ability to earn profits.

In short. the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant has made a significant contribution to the
Venezuelan Companies during the period in which it has controlled them. This contribution has
been reflected in its own efforts in managing the Companies and in a cash contribution, which
exceeds USD 73 million.

e. Coda

 

There are situations in which a foreign investor, although it is the owner of a protected
investment, does not enjoy the protection of the corresponding treaty. This happens in cases in
which the investor has not acted in good faith, has engaged in abuse of rights, has fraudulently
benefited from a corporate structure, or is only the formal owner of the investment but has made
no investment.

The Respondent does not allege that the Claimant has not acted in good faith, has engaged in
abuse of rights, or has fraudulently benefited from a corporate structure. In addition, the Tribunal
does not see evidence that these situations could have occurred.

The Respondent, however, has made a special reference to an award in which the Arbitral
Tribunal would have established that a lack of contribution is sufficient to deny the existence of
investment and its own jurisdiction: KT Asia. Actually, that case can be clearly distinguished
from this case.

KTAsia
The facts in KT Asia are the following:

Mr. Ablyazov was the ultimate owner of multiple companies through trustees and straw
men, who were the ones who formally claimed to be the owners of the securities. These
persons acted on behalf of Mr. Ablyazov, but kept this situation secret. Mr. Ablyazov
himself was never formally a shareholder in any of the companies, and, therefore, a group
of companies never existed. The claimant, KT Asia, had acquired the shares of BTA (the
company that was the object of the alleged expropriation) from two other companies
controlled by Mr. Ablyazov for a nominal price, which it never actually paid. KT Asia
never injected capital or made any contribution for the benefit of BTA, neither during the
acquisition nor afterward.

Based on those facts, the tribunal in KT Asia held that the claimant had not made any contribution
in connection with the alleged investment, and that it had neither the capacity nor the intention of

doing so in the future. Therefore, the tribunal ruled that there was no investment for purposes of
article 25(1) of the Convention.

KT Asia is part of a long list of cases in which the tribunals rejected the claimants’ standing to
sue, because they had only disbursed a nominal value for the investment, which showed that they
were mere trustees, straw men, or intermediaries.”

This factual situation bears no relation to the one in this arbitration. In this case, the Claimant
belongs to a group of ies that historically has made imp ibuti to the
Venezuelan Companies; it has legitimately acquired shares during the liquidation of a Venezuelan
holding company belonging to the group, and since then it has managed the Companies and made
significant contributions of capital when it reinvested a significant portion of the dividends
generated.

 

Mobil

In fact, the nucleus of fact of this dispute is more similar to the one in Mobil, a case in which the
claimant decided to restructure in order to incorporate a Dutch company into the chain of
ownership and benefit from the BIT between the Netherlands and Venezuela. The Bolivarian
Republic raised a jurisdictional defense, arguing that the restructuring implied an abuse of rights;
the tribunal rejected it with regard to the disputes arising after the taking of control. In its
argument, the tribunal stated the following:

“190. It thus appears to the Tribunal that the main, if not the sole purpose of
the restructuring was to protect Mobil investments from adverse Venezuelan
measures in getting access to ICSID arbitration through the Dutch-
Venezuela BIT. This choice was considered as “logical,” taking into account
the double taxation agreements concluded by the Netherlands and the
activities that Exxon Mobil already had in that country.

191. Such restructuring could be “legitimate corporate planning” as
contended by the Claimants or an “abuse of right” as submitted by the
Respondents. It depends upon the circumstances in which it happened.” ”°

In the specific circumstances of that case, the tribunal held that the restructuring performed by
Mobil actually constituted “legitimate corporate planning.””?”

DAMAGE TO THE CLAIMANT’S BUSINESS OUTSIDE VENEZUELA

Introduction

In its Statement of Claim, OIEG sought USD 123,849,648 for the possible losses that it could
suffer as a result of the entrance of Venvidrio in the Brazilian market.”* OIEG argued that:

Respondent allowed third parties access to the Plants on numerous occasions and therefore
allowed third parties total access to its intellectual property, know-how and technical
processes.

Venvidrio executed a cooperation agreement with one of the visiting companies, Uruguayan
Envidrio. The aim of the alliance was to jointly produce, exchange technology and
knowledge, and expand the exports of glass containers to the Brazilian market.

In 2011, Venvidrio executed agreements with Brazilian beer producer, Ambev, and with the
Ecuadorian government to supply them with glass containers.

OIEG had a 55% share of the Brazilian market for the sale of glass containers, and
according to the calculations of its expert, it could end up losing 9.5% of its market share.

In its Closing Brief, Claimant adjusted the amount of its claim for damages suffered outside of
Venezuela to USD 50,566,759.

Respondent's Position

Venezuela has insisted that the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to rule on the damages to
Claimant’s businesses outside Venezuela because:

- The claim is based on assets that are not owned by Claimant;”” and

Because Claimant has not proven the existence of any damage or loss, and without damage
there can be no dispute.”*°

As the Bolivarian Republic explains, Claimant is not the owner of the technology, know-how and
technical processes used in the Companies. Therefore, Venezuela argues that:

arbitration) cannot be considered an “investor” ;"!

-  OIEG lacks standing and cannot have suffered any damage whatsoever, derived from the

264. Claimant opposes the argument put forth by Venezuela that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to rule
on its claims for damages suffered by its businesses outside Venezuela.

265. Claimant alleges that the damages it suffered are a direct result of the illegal actions of Venezuela
in expropriating the Companies.” Claimant asserts that in the present proceeding, it is not even
claiming part or all of the “(colossal) amount” that the intellectual property of OBGC represents,
rather only the damage suffered as a result of the illegal actions of Venezuela.”*”

266. Finally, Claimant believes that the concession of full’* compensation for the damages it suffered
indirectly is a matter of substance and not jurisdiction.”*° Therefore, it asks the Tribunal to

reiterate the conclusion adopted in paragraph 29 of Procedural Order No. 1 and reject the second
objection to jurisdiction raised by Respondent.

The Analysis of the Tribunal

The Tribunal reiterates the decision that it adopted in paragraph 29 of Procedural Ruling No. 1:°*°

The determination of harm is intrinsically linked to the existence of a breach. Therefore,
Defendant’s second objection cannot be d from the sub of the dispute. The Tribunal
will address this claim once the existence of an expropriation is found and in the context of the
determination of the compensation due.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the Tribunal rejects the two jurisdictional defenses raised by Venezuela, and rules

that the Centre has jurisdiction and the Tribunal itself has jurisdiction to hear all the issues raised
in this proceeding and rule on the substance of the dispute.

4 Procedural Ruling No. 1: “29. Defendant’s second objection concerns a claim by Plaintiff about alleged harm
suffered outside Venezuela. The determination of harm is intrinsically linked to the existence of a breach. Therefore,
Defendant’s second objection cannot be separated from the substance of the dispute, and it is not possible to make a
preliminary rejection of the objection. The rejection in limine of Plaintiff's claim for harm suffered outside
Venezuela would imply a possible risk of prejudging, since the Tribunal would be deciding matters before the
parties had the opportunity to fully address them.” [The Tribunal’s translation]

Vi. LIABILITY

1. APPLICABLE LAW

269. The law that applies to Claimant’s requests must be settled in accordance with the provisions of the

BIT and, if applicable, with the provisions of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.

270. Article 9(5) of the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT provides as follows:

IS

“The arbitral award shall be based on:

- _ the law of the Contracting Party concerned;

- the provisions of this Agreement and other relevant Agreements between the Contracting
Parties;

- the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments;

- the general principles of international law; and such rules of law as may be agreed by the
parties to the dispute.”

The Arbitral Tribunal shall then first apply Venezuelan Law and the provisions of the BIT itself and
in the absence of other agreements between the Netherlands and Venezuela or special agreements
relating to the ii by Claimant. I them with the i general principles of
international Law.

 

Article 42(1) of the Convention provides as follows:

“The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by
the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the
Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules
of international law as may be applicable.”

The sources referred to in this provision do not differ substantially from the provisions in Article
9(5) of the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT: agreements between the State and the investor, Venezuelan
Law and the rules of international law, including the BIT itself.

The order in which applicable sources are listed is not the same in each of the sources. This,
however, is not relevant, as the relation among these sources is not hierarchical but based on
specificity.

Considerations in connection with Claimant’s requests

The Tribunal shall now analyze the claims made by Claimant on the merits, following the order in
which Claimant proposed them in its filings.

‘Award

. In its analysis of the claims, the Tribunal has taken into consideration the abundant and extensive
documents filed by the Parties and all of the factual and legal arguments in support of each of their
claims. Nevertheless, in this Award the Tribunal shall only expressly refer to the arguments it
deems crucial for its decision.

BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE BIT: UNLAWFUL EXPROPRIATION

. The main cause of action of Claimant is the fact that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, through
the actions and omissions of its government entities, has unlawfully expropriated the Claimant’s
investment in violation of Article 6 of the BIT. Respondent, in turn, denies the unlawfulness of the
expropriation and argues that it was conducted in compliance with international Law.

Claimant’s Position

. Claimant argues that the expropriation conducted by Respondent is unlawful as it does not comply
with the requirements of Article 6 of the BIT and, thus, it is entitled to be “fully compensated” for
its investment.”*! Claimant specifically argues that: (i) the expropriation was not in the public
interest; (ii) the expropriation was arbitrary, contrary to Venezuelan Administrative Law and
violated the Companies’ right to due process of law; (iii) the expropriation was discriminatory in
nature, and (iv) Respondent has not paid any form of compensation.

(i) The expropriation was not in the public interest

. Claimant considers it demonstrated that the expropriation was not conducted in the defense of a
“genuine public interest” according to the standard set in ADC. President Chavez selected
Claimant because of its foreign nationality.“? In addition, Claimant suggests that the true
motivation for the expropriation was a desire to cause damage to Polar, the largest private company
in Venezuela and minority shareholder and main customer of the Companies.”“*

. The Expropriation Decree and the accusations of noncompliance with environmental, labor and
jurisdiction laws were nothing but a “convenient device”*’ to dispossess OIEG of its
Companies™*—since prior to the expropriation, the authorities had never made any accusation
against the Companies.

. Further, Claimant assures that the manifest incoherence of the diverse justifications offered by
Venezuela for the expropriation—in the President’s words, the alleged contraventions of

environmental law and workers’ rights; in the Expropriation Decree, violations of free
competition—was fabricated in a rush after the fact and highlights the lack of a genuine public
interest.“”

282. Claimant states that although the Expropriation Decree is founded on alleged violations of the Right
to free competition, no credible evidence supporting such accusations has been produced™* and
Venezuelan authorities have neither investigated nor issued any decision on the alleged
violations.” Neither a violation of free competition (which can only be penalized by the

Superintendence for the Promotion and Protection of Free Competition) nor any of the other
250

reasons offered by Respondent (food security or endogenous development)” justifies
expropriation.”*!
(ii) The expropriation was arbitrary, contrary to ‘an Administrative Law and violated the

 

Companies’ right to due process

283. Claimant considers that Article 6(a) of the BIT requires all expropriations to be conducted in
compliance with due process of law, which grants significant procedural rights which have been
violated in this case. Namely,

- The obligation to give investors sufficient notice;?*

- Investors’ right to be heard before the State implemented the expropriation order;?**
- The right to be informed of precisely which assets are being expropriated;?**

- The right to know the implementation plan for the expropriation order.”**

284. Claimant argues that it does not need to prove the fact that the expropriation violated Venezuelan
Law to demonstrate that Respondent violated Article 6 of the BIT.”** However, it considers that the
violation by the Republic of its own Law clearly shows that Venezuela acted arbitrarily or without
complying with due process of law.”*’ Claimant refers to three types of violations of domestic Law

- It failed to comply with any of the prior requirements set forth in the LECUPS;”*
- It implemented the Expropriation Decree in an unlawful manner,”*° and
- It occupied the Plants with no respect for due process of law.

285. Specifically:

286. First, Claimant argues that Respondent failed to comply with any of the prior requirements set forth
in the LECUPS*" because:

- It did not declare that a given type of “public works” had a “public purpose and social
interest,” which declaration must be issued by the legislative branch of Venezuela."

- It did not make a decision to build “a specific public works project;””®*

- It did not design a project for said “public works” to identify the property that “necessarily”
had to be expropriated in order to perform the public works,” but rather first identified the
property it wished to expropriate and then decided what to do with it.

287. Second, Claimant considers that the actions taken by Respondent to implement the Expropriation
Decree are unlawful. The LECUPS requires compliance with certain conditions prior to occupying
the expropriated property.”®° Nonetheless, they were not met in the instant case:*”

- OIEG was given no notice prior to the expropriation;
- the expropriated property was not valuated by an appraisal committee; and

- Venezuela did not deposit any funds so as to guarantee the payment to the owner.

Award

Finally, Claimant asserts that Venezuela fabricated accusations regarding a violation of the
INDEPABIS Law by the Companies in order to occupy the Plants without complying with due
process of law.”** Claimant bases its argument on the statements by the Respondent’s expert
witness on Venezuelan Law:

- The expert stated that the reference to Articles 111 and 112 of the INDEPABIS Law in the
Plants occupation records were probably “errors” made due to the urgency of the
situation,” and

- The expert confirmed at the Hearing that in order to occupy the Plants based on a violation
of the INDEPABIS Law, Respondent should have initiated a formal, prior administrative
penalty procedure and stated he was not aware of the existence of any such procedure.”

Claimant concludes that the expropriation was not conducted in accordance with due process of
law, thus violating Article 6(a) of the BIT.

(iii) The expropriation was discriminatory in nature

Claimant argues that Respondent has expropriated the investments of OIEG in a discriminatory
manner, in violation of Article 6(b) of the BIT.

Claimant supports its argument by stating that the Companies were expropriated in order to
maintain the company out of foreign hands, as then President Chavez specifically mentioned the
American ownership of the Companies during his expropriation announcement2”! In addition,
Claimant considers that the expropriation has had the effect of eliminating the only foreign
participation in the glass container manufacturing industry.?” Such industry has not been subject to
a more extensive nationalization process in the sector and the other Venezuelan companies of the
sector have not been expropriated by the State.””> Therefore, Respondent has afforded
discriminatory treatment in violation of Article 6(b) of the BIT.?

(iv) dent has failed to provide any i to the Claimant
Claimant argues that Respondent has paid no form of compensation.””* According to Claimant, this

constitutes sufficient motive for the Tribunal to consider that Respondent has violated A 6 of the
BIT.

293. Claimant denies that lack of compensation may be attributed to Claimant itself.?” Claimant
considers that it has been proved that Respondent did not conduct negotiations in good faith and
made an absurdly low compensation offer with complete disregard for fair market price that was
designed to evade the responsibilities of the Republic.” Thus, it considers that the decision entered
in Conoco Phillips is applicable to this dispute. In that case—based on the same BIT as this
dispute—the Tribunal decided that Venezuela had violated the compensation requirement under
Article 6(c) of the BIT, as it did not negotiate the compensation with Claimants based on the fair
market price of the expropriated investments.?”°

294. OIEG considers that it has been demonstrated that the expropriation procedure has made no
progress because Respondent failed to comply with the basic procedural requirements to move the
procedure forward.?”°

295. Moreover, Claimant denies the existence of a lack of investment and poor performance at the
Plants, stating that the accusations of the Republic in that regard only seek to reduce the amount of
compensation it must pay under the BIT.*°

296. In summary, Claimant considers it evident that the expropriation violated all of the cumulative
requirements set forth in Article 6 of the BIT and was therefore unlawful pursuant to international
Law.

2.2. Respondent’s Position

297. Respondent argues that the expropriation complies with the requirements of Article 6 of the BIT
and that the Tribunal cannot award compensation to Claimant.”*!

298. Respondent insists that international Law recognizes the right of sovereign States to conduct
expropriations,”* adding that Article 6 of the BIT allows for the expropriation of assets under
certain circumstances, which are fully met in the case at hand.”** Respondent states that the
expropriation: (i) was conducted in the public interest; (ii) complied with due process of law; (iii)
was not discriminatory, and (iv) was in exchange for compensation, which under the BIT does not
need to be immediate and which Respondent has attempted to pay by means of negotiations and
following the expropriation procedure set forth in Venezuelan law.

(i) Venezuela acquired the Plants in the public interest

Respondent states that it acquired the Companies in the defense of two well-known, Jong-
established public interest policies: food security and endogenous development;”* and to protect

fundamental constitutional principles.”*°

The Bolivarian Republic considers that the Companies were expropriated in the defense of
Venezuelan food security. Respondent bases this allegation on:

. The text of the Expropriation Decree,”*”

- The public statements made by Minister Mr. Menéndez, who mentioned this point in at
least four appearances,”** and

= The statements made by Mr. Machaen™? and Mr. Hernandez,”” who claimed to know that
this was one of the justifications offered by Respondent for the expropriation.”!

With regard to the endogenous development policy (i.e., the policy to promote domestic and
autonomous production in strategic sectors of the economy””), Respondent holds that Claimant's
silence proves the validity of this policy as grounds for expropriation.”*?

Finally, in response to Claimants allegations regarding incoherence in the justifications offered by
Venezuela for the expropriation, Respondent argues as follows:

- President Chavez did not order the expropriation—it was ordered under the Expropriation
Decree;?**

- There is no fundamental inconsistency between President Chavez’s speech and the
subsequent statements made by other Government officials;?”*

Co Claimant has failed to prove its theory that the expropriation was aimed at negatively
affecting the Polar Group.”

Therefore, Respondent concludes that the expropriation was conducted in the public interest, in
accordance with the requirements of Article 6 of the BIT.

(ii) The expropriation was carried out in accordance with due process
Respondent denies any violation of due process of law in the course of the expropriation.

makes the ing to defend its ad

- In the context of expropriations, the only requirement of due process of law under
international Law is for the receiving State to assure the investor is provided with an
opportunity to have measures reviewed by an independent entity.

- Under international Law, the receiving State is not required to give notice of the
expropriation order in advance;

- Respondent has acted in compliance with its domestic Law, and

- Even if it had not, failure to comply with domestic Law does not constitute a breach of
international Law or of the BIT.

Specifically, the Bolivarian Republic argues that according to the principles of international Law,
due process of law requires an opportunity for the expropriation and compensation to be reviewed
by an independent entity.°* The LECUPS provides such mechanisms for independent review.
Claimant, however, refused to use them from the outset.”

 

307. Venezuela states that there is no requirement (either under international Law or under Venezuelan
Law) for the receiving State to give early notice of the expropriation order to the investor.*””

308. Respondent adds that the forced occupation and acquisition of the Plants was conducted in

with Law.*! The appli laws are the Constitution, the LECUPS and

Article 6 of the INDEPABIS Law,*”—the special law in connection with the general provisions of
the LECUPS.*°

Award

- Contrary to the Claimant’s argument, the LECUPS does not require the prior existence of
“public works;” and even if it did, Article 6 of the INDEPABIS Law, the application of
which prevails in this case, does not require the prior existence of “public works;

- Under the LECUPS, there is no requirement for the prior declaration of a “public purpose or
social interest” to be linked with “public works,” or for a decision to construct “public works”
to be made prior to the publication of the Decree;**

- Similarly, there is no requirement for a causa expropiandi to exist; and even if there were, it
is irrelevant as Article 6 of the INDEPABIS Law, which applies primarily, does not require
the existence of a cause of expropriation;*°

- It is not true that the Expropriation Decree is penalizing in nature; the Decree is based on
Article 6(1), not Article 6(3), of the INDEPABIS Law,*” and therefore complies with
Venezuelan Law.

310. Further, Respondent holds that the occupation of the Plants was performed in accordance with
Venezuelan Law and rejects all allegations to the contrary, based on the following arguments:

i Contrary to what Claimant says, Venezuelan Law allows for the occupation of expropriated
property without court authorization; in fact, Article 6(4) of the INDEPABIS Law requires
no court authorization in order to occupy expropriated assets;“” thus, INDEPABIS was
entitled to occupy the Plants since the Expropriation Decree was published;*"°

- INDEPABIS was entitled to decide whether to conduct the occupation under Article 6(4) or
do so under Article 112(1) of the INDEPABIS Law indistinctly;*"' it chose to carry out the
occupation under Article 112 because there was an objective risk of dismantlement or

production stoppage;*!?

= The occupation did not violate Article 4 of the Expropriation Decree, since that Article does
not require occupation to be conducted pursuant to Article 56 of the Expropriation Law but
simply contemplates that possibility;*?

- The occupation order issued by the First Administrative Court is lawful: Venezuelan case law
allows for the issuance of provisional remedies in expropriation proceedings, and it was
requested by Respondent ex abundanti cautela.**

311.

Finally, Respondent argues that under international Law, an alleged violation of domestic Law does
not constitute a failure to comply with the due process of law guarantee set forth in Article 6 of the
BIT, except where the investor is able to prove that a given breach of domestic legislation, under
the precise circumstances of a case, can amount to an international violation®“—which Claimant

has not been able to prove.*"*

312. In the light of these arguments, Respondent concludes that the expropriation and occupation of the
plants was conducted in accordance with the due process requirement set forth in Article 6 of the
BIT.

(iii) | The expropriation was not discriminatory

313. Respondent considers that Claimant has been unable to prove that the expropriation was
discriminatory either in terms of its purpose or in terms of its effect.*'’ The expropriation was not
conducted in order to place the glass container manufacturing industry in national hands; and the
reference made by President Chavez to the nationality of the parent company was “obviously
incidental” and isolated.*"* The effect of the expropriation was not discriminatory either. The
dominant position that OIEG held in the market turned it into a critical objective to guarantee food
security.*!? However, the Republic saw no need and had no intent to expropriate other glass
container manufacturing companies which did not place the Venezuelan economy and food security
at risk.°°

(iv) R has met and ii to meet its payment

314. Respondent admits that it must compensate Claimant by paying the fair market price of Claimant’s
share in OldV and Favianca.*”' However, Respondent states it could only be reasonably expected to
comply with such duty in two ways:

- By means of the procedure set forth in the LECUPS, which has already been initiated.**

Respondent argues that Article 6 of the BIT does not require compensation to be paid immediately,
but “without undue delay.” Therefore, it considers that there has been no breach of Article 6,
because:

- Claimant has not allowed the procedure established by the State to be carried out adequately,
and

: Claimant has not proved that such procedures cannot result in the payment of fair
compensation within a reasonable period of time.*”*

Specifically, Venezuela argues that the following undisputed facts are sufficient to establish that
Respondent has complied or has reasonably attempted to comply with Article 6 of the BIT:

= The Parties held four meetings to negotiate the compensation;

- Claimant only discussed the amount in two of those meetings;

- Claimant initially requested compensation in the amount of one billion US dollars;
- Respondent made a counteroffer of USD 100-120 million;

- Claimant made no subsequent counteroffer and did not seek to resume negotiations.

Respondent argues that its offer was reasonable,*”> and even if it were not, it holds that Claimant

made no counteroffer and was not willing to resume negotiations. Therefore, Respondent accuses
Claimant of participating in the negotiations superficially and even in bad faith.

Venezuela is willing to pay the applicable compensation by means of the procedure established for
said purpose: the one provided in the LECUPS.”” That procedure complies with the requirements
of Article 6 of the BIT,” is progressing “at top speed,” the summonses for all of the parties have

already been published,**° and the process is now at the stage at which the fair price is to be set.**!

319. Respondent insists that the Claimant’s non-appearance at the proceedings is what has thwarted their
proper progress.*? Claimant could have participated in the LECUPS procedure reserving its rights
under the BIT. The fact that the compensation amount has not been established and that Claimant

has not received it are consequences of its own attitude.***

320. In summary, the Bolivarian Republic considers it proved that Claimant has no basis to argue that
Venezuela has not paid the compensation in breach of the provisions of Article 6 of the BIT.

2.3 The Analysis of the Tribunal

321:

Claimant argues that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has expropriated its investment in
Venezuela. Respondent does not deny it. To resolve this dispute, the Tribunal will proceed as
follows:

- First, it will explain the requirements for expropriation in the BIT (A);

i Second, it will establish the proven facts (B);

- Next, it will determine whether the proven facts fit the expropriation standard (C);

- Subsequently, it will determine whether the BIT’s requirements for legitimate expropriation
have been met (D).

A. Requirements for expropriation in the BIT

322. As a starting point, it is worth recalling the wording of Article 6 of the BIT between the
Netherlands and Venezuela:

“None of the Contracting Parties shall take any measure to expropriate or nationalize the
investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party, or take measures with an effect
equivalent to that of nationalization or expropriation in relation to such investments, except if
the following conditions are met:

a) Such measures shall be taken in the public interest and in accordance with due legal
process;

Award

b) The measures shall not be discriminatory or contrary to any commitment assumed by the
Contracting Party that takes them;

2)

The measures shall be taken after fair compensation. Such compensation shall represent
the market value of the affected investments just before the measures are taken or before
the imminent measures are made public knowledge, whichever occurs first; it shall
include interest at a normal commercial rate up to the payment date; and in order to be
enforced for the claimants, it shall be paid and made transferable without undue delay to
the country designated by the interested claimants in the currency of the country of which
the claimants are nationals or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the
claimants.”***

The above provisions are expressed in terms of prohibition: they obligate the Bolivarian Republic
of Venezuela (and also the other State) to refrain from adopting “expropriatory measures” except
if they meet certain requirements: public interest, due process, non-discrimination and proper
compensation.

Measures

Although not defined in the BIT, the concept of “measure” must be understood in the broad
sense. This can be seen (applying Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties)
from the very text of the BIT, which adds the adjective “any” to the a A emphasize its broad
scope. C it all types of admi ive or judicial acts
performed by any of the branches of government of the Bolivarian Republic (or by any other
entity for whose acts the Republic is liable in accordance with International law), and prohibits
such acts from resulting in an expropriation, nationalization or equivalent measures.

 

The BIT does not define the terms “expropriation,” “nationalization,” or “equivalent measure”
and this gap must be filled in based on the principles of International Law.

Expropriation

“Expropriation” consists of the State, in exercise of its sovereign powers, dispossessing an
investor protected by the Treaty, depriving it of the control or the ownership of a protected
investment. Dispossession means that the investor suffers the loss of the use and enjoyment (and

also the hip) of the i Thus, the ition in the BIT centers on the
investor, not on the State. It does not require that the dispossession of the investor result in an
appropriation in benefit of the State. However, in most cases, the investor's loss will lead to the
reciprocal gain of a public entity, which will facilitate the classification of the action as
expropriatory. The definition in the Treaty also does not require that the intent to dispossess exist.

 

+ Emphasis added.

Award

327. Investment and investor are defined terms in the BIT and the Tribunal has concluded that
Claimant is an investor for the purposes of the Treaty and that it is the owners of a protected
investment materialized in the Plants.*°
Nationalization

328. “Nationalization” is a term similar to expropriation, with the addition that it frequently involves
complete sectors of the economy and that the State normally assumes ownership of the
investment it has taken from the investor.**°
Equivalent measures

329. The third term used by Article 6 of the BIT is “measures with an equivalent effect.” The
circumlocution covers what is usually known as regulatory or indirect expropriation. These are
legislative or administrative acts adopted by State, normally in exercise of its regulatory or
policy-making powers, but which translate into a significant interference in the use and
enjoyment of an investment, not necessarily going so far as to deprive the investor of the
ownership and control of its investment.

Exceptions

330. The prohibition on adopting expropriatory, nationalization or equivalent measures is not absolute.
The BIT allows them, provided three conditions are met (and the appropriate compensation is
also paid):

- They are for reasons of public interest;
- They are not discriminatory; and
- They are adopted in accordance with “due process of law.”
331. A legitimate expropriation additionally requires the payment of a “fair” compensation that:

- Must represent the market value of the expropriated investment;

- At the time “just before the measures are taken or the imminent measures are made public
knowledge, whichever occurs first;”

- “shall include interest at a normal commercial rate up to the payment date;” and

- “shall be paid and made transferable without undue delay;”

°° See paragraph 158 supra.

396 Tn practice, the term nationalization is usually reserved for the expropriation of natural resources or industrial
sectors in benefit of the State or a government entity; see Brownlie: “Principles of Public International Law, 7th Ed
(2008), p. 532.

- “in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.”
Proven facts

The relevant proven facts for determining whether an expropriation took place are the following
(a more extensive explanation is found in paragraphs 85 to 153 above):

(i) On the evening of 25 October 2010, President Chavez made a televised speech announcing the
immediate expropriation of the Venezuelan companies owned by Owens-Illinois. This was the
first news that the Bolivarian Republic intended to expropriate the Companies.

The Expropriation Decree

(ii) The next day, 26 October 2010, the Bolivarian Republic enacted the Expropriation Decree,
formalizing, on an urgent basis, the forced acquisition of:

- the properties owned by OldV,

- the OldV and Favianca Plants, including the movable property belonging to or found in
those plants;

- the means of transportation used in the OldV process that were necessary for executing its
work and

- any other tangible goods belonging to OldV that were needed to execute purpose of the

project “strengthening of the public sector industrial capacity in the manufacture of glass

iners for the V people” [“Glass Si h Project”}*”

According to the Expropriation Decree, the expropriated goods became part of the Republic’s
assets through the MINCIT, pursuant to Art. 11 of the LECUPS.***

The preventive occupation measure ordered by INDEPABIS

(iii) The next day, 27 October 2010, INDEPABIS (the Venezuelan Consumer Protection

Agency), went to the Valera plant owned by Favianca to “carry out the preventive temporary

occupation measure” under Articles 111 and 112 of the INDEPABIS Law.” One day later, it
inted the board that it d with the of the ‘aes

(iv) At the Los Guayos Plant owned by OldV, the events occurred somewhat differently. On 29
October 2010, INDEPABIS went to this factory in order to conduct an audit." After determining
purported violations of the INDEPABIS Law, INDEPABIS ordered a “preventive temporary
occupation and operation measure for a term of ninety (90) days [...]” and created a temporary
management board.**

The result of the acts ordered by INDEPABIS was that, effective 29 October 2010, the Bolivarian
Republic took physical possession of the Valera and Los Guayos Plants and exercised effective
control over them.

The isi remedy ordered by of the First Administrative Court

(v) Several weeks later, on 18 November 2010, the Office of the Attorney General filed a petition
with The First Administrative Court for an unnamed provisional remedy consisting of the
occupation, possession and use of the movable and immovable properties and improvements
presumably owned by OldV and Favianca.** The petition was based on the injunctive power of
the Administrative Law judge and the urgency of implementing the Glass Strengthening
Project.** On 20 December 2010, without allowing Claimant a hearing, the Court:

- Ordered the requested provisional remedy and

- Authorized the creation of an ad hoc management board, appointed by MINCIT, to
manage, organize and control the Companies.***

This provisional remedy was subsequently joined to the expropriation proceedings,*° and came
to be the instrumental occupation measure in those proceedings.

(vi) Three months later, on 11 March 2011,**” the MINCIT effectively created the Management
Board. Several days later, on 16 and 25 March 2011, respectively, the Enforcement Courts of the
Los Guayos and Valera municipalities:

- Enforced the provisional remedy authorized by The First Administrative Court for the
occupation, possession and use of the Companies’ assets;

: Installed the ad hoc Management Board; and

- Ordered that the Companies’ bank accounts could only be used with the express
authorization of the ad hoc management board.**

The management of the Plants, initially entrusted to INDEPABIS, thus passed without
interruption to the ad hoc management board ordered by the Administrative Court and controlled
by the MINCIT.

Lastly, the Bolivarian Republic created a public company under the MINCIT, Venvidrio, which
on 30 April 2011 assumed direct management of the Plants.“? Venvidrio also appropriated the
balances in the bank accounts belonging to the Companies.**”

Expropriation procedure under the LECUPS

(vii) Although the Bolivarian Republic has material control and possession of the expropriated
assets, at least since 29 October 2010, the formal transfer of ownership is still pending, because
the expropriation procedure under the LECUPS continues its course in the Venezuelan courts and
a final decision has not been handed down to date.**

The Office of the Attorney General commenced the amicable settlement phase ordered in the
LECUPS in late 2010*” and proposed that the parties sign an Official Record of Commencement
of Amicable Settlement on 17 November 2010.°* Shortly thereafter, on 9 December 2010, OldV
wrote to Minister Menéndez informing him that the Companies

“would not participate in the expropriation procedures initiated by the Office of the
Attorney General of the Republic or sign the proposed official record for purposes of said
procedures because they disagree with its terms.” ***

Oldv also. contended that the fair compensation should be determined based on the provisions of
the BIT.**

345. In view of the fact that the parties were unable to reach an amicable agreement, on 14 March
2011, the Office of the Attorney General initiated a legal procedure under the LECUPS, filing an
expropriation petition with the First and Second Administrative Courts requesting

“the expropriation of the movable and immovable properties belonging to the commercial
companies OWENS ILLINOIS DE VENEZUELA, C.A. and FABRICA DE VIDRIOS
LOS ANDES, C.V. (FAVIANCA).”**

346. On 5 April 2011, the same day that Venvidrio was created, the Fact-Finding Panel of the Supreme
Court of Justice issued a decision in which it admitted the expropriation petition filed by the
Office of the Attorney General and ordered that notice be served to the owners of the Companies
so that the respective judicial inspections could be conducted.**’ The expropriation proceeding
was subsequently joined with the provisional remedy that had been authorized by The First
Administrative Court.** Currently, the Administrative Courts continue to hear the expropriation
proceedings.**

The fit of the facts with the concept of expropriation

The proven facts show that:

- Claimant, through its controlling shareholdings in two Venezuelan companies, OldV and
Favianca, was the owner of an investment in the Bolivarian Republic, materialized in the
Plants.

- The Bolivarian Republic has issued a Decree ordering the “forced acquisition” of the Plants
and certain ancillary assets;

- Since 29 October 2010, the possession and management of the Plants has been assumed by
agencies or entities that are part of Respondent.

- OldV and Favianca, and OIEG indirectly, were deprived of the use and enjoyment of the
assets.

In the Tribunal’s opinion, the facts fit neatly with the presumptions that underlie Art. 6 of the
BIT: Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has taken an expropriation measure, and more
specifically, a nationalization measure, with respect to an investment protected by the Treaty.

Indeed:

Expropriatory measure

Claimant states that the expropriation took the form of an Expropriation Decree through which its
Companies were reduced to mere empty shells stripped of any practical and economic use, and all
its assets subjected to a forced acquisition in favor of the State.

There is nothing to disagree with in this assessment.

.... and nationalization measure

The measures taken by the Bolivarian Republic are not simply expropriatory, they also entail
nationalization. The properties and rights of which the foreign investor was deprived have gone
on to become the assets of the National Executive Branch, thus reinforcing the conviction that the
adopted measures are expropriatory.*°*

Sovereign in nature

In order to be classified as expropriatory or nationalization measures, the measures adopted by a

State must also have been executed in exercise of sovereign powers and not mere acts of a
contractual nature. This requirement is met in the present case: an expropriation formalized in a

Award

Decree can never be considered an act of a contractual nature. To the contrary, we are dealing
with an exceptional administrative power that is only available to the State.

The preventive temporary occupation measures ordered by INDEPABIS are also administrative
in nature.

Similarly, the decisions on occupation, possession and advance use of the Companies’ assets
issued by The First Administrative Court are judicial acts executed by one of the branches of the
Venezuelan government in exercise of its jurisdictional powers.

Relevant date

The facts described above also make it possible to establish the relevant date for purposes of the
expropriation.

This date must coincide with the time that the decision to deprive the investor of the use and

enjoyment of its investment was enacted. In this case, that is 26 October 2010, the date on which
the Expropriation Decree was issued and went into force.

Legality requirements for expropriation

Article 6 of the BIT presupposes that the expropriatory measures or their equivalents will only be
legal if the following conditions are met:

- They are due to reasons of public interest;

- They are not discriminatory;

- They are adopted in accordance with “due process of law” and
- The appropriate compensation is paid.

Therefore, it must be determined whether the Republic met these conditions for the expropriation
to be classified as legal. Claimant argues that each of the requirements must be met.*® The
Tribunal—as well as the legal doctrine*’—agree. The failure to meet any of the requirements

would make the expropriation unlawful.

In the following section, the Tribunal will determine whether Venezuela has complied with the
requirements set forth in the Treaty.

D. Requirements for an expropriation to be considered lawful

364. Claimant argues that Venezuela has not met any of the set conditions for a lawful expropriation
according to Art. 6 of the BIT. The Bolivarian Republic, on the other hand, believes that it has
complied with all of them.

365. The Tribunal will determine:
- First, if the measure was issued in the public interest™®* (a);
- Second, if the expropriation was carried out in keeping with due process” (b);
- Third, if the expropriation was discriminatory*” (c), and
- Lastly, if Claimant has been compensated*”! (d).

a. The measure was taken in the public interest

366. Claimant believes it has been proven that the expropriation was not carried out in defense of a
“genuine public interest” for three main reasons:

- There is an obvious inconsistency between the reasoning in the president’s speech and in
the Expropriation Decree, which would demonstrate the lack of a legitimate public
interest.”

- The Expropriation Decree and the accusations of violation of the defense of competition
laws were a “convenient device™”* for stripping OIEG of its Companies,*” since there is
no evidence to support the supposed violations of the right to free competition, nor have the
Venezuelan authorities investigated and/or issued any decision.*”*

Neither the violations of free competition’ nor any of the other reasons invoked by
Respondent (food security or endogenous development)” justify the expropriation
according to Venezuelan law.*”*

For its part, Respondent asserts that the Tribunal must grant greater deference to the definition
that the Republic has made of its public interest 379 and explains that the expropriation was carried
out to protect basic constitutional principles®’ and in defense of two well-known and long-
standing policies of public interest: food security’ and endogenous development,*® which the
Republic has been implementing since 2001*** and 2007, respectively.

The Tribunal’s opinion

In order to determine whether the expropriation was actually carried out for reasons of public
interest, we must analyze how the Expropriation Decree itself justifies the decision. The decree
defines its objective as a project that it refers to with the name “strengthening of the public
sector’s industrial capacity in the fabrication of glass containers for the Venezuelan people,” and
establishes the grounds for the administration’s actions in its ‘whereas clauses’ as follows:

- The national sector dedicated to the production and marketing of glass containers is a
priority within the economic policy of endogenous development promoted by the National
government in order to create jobs and guarantee a proper level of welfare for the
population;***

- The INDEPABIS Law declares all the assets needed to engage in the production,
manufacture, import, storage, transportation, distribution and marketing of goods and
services to be of public utility and social interest.***

These two ‘whereas clauses’ allow Respondent to assert that the expropriation was carried out in
defense of well-known and longstanding policies of public interest: endogenous development”*”
and food security.***

The Tribunal partially shares Respondent's position. It believes it plausible that the Decree was
issued to foster endogenous development, but does not find sufficient proof that its purpose was
also to guarantee food security.

Endogenous development

371. Endogenous development is a public policy defined by the Bolivarian Republic designed to
promote and consolidate national and autonomous production in sectors considered to be of
importance for development, which it has been implementing in various sectors of the economy
since 2007.

372. Inits Preamble, the Expropriation Decree invokes endogenous development as one of its objectives,
envisaging the expropriation of the Plants as a way of making progress in attaining that objective by
transferring Venezuela’s main Blass producer to the public sector. From that perspective, the

policy of p i may be iated with the requi of
public interest established in Art. 6 of the BIT.

 

Food Security

373. Food security is supported in Art. 305 of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
which deems it as

“...sufficient and stable availability of food throughout the nation and timely and
permanent access to it by consumers. Food safety will be reached by developing and
favoring internal agricultural production, understanding this to be produce obtained from
agricultural, livestock, fishing and aquatic activities. Food production is of national interest
and fundamental for the economic and social development of the Nation. For these
purposes, the State will decree the financial, commercial, technology transfer, land holding,
infrastructure, training, and other measures necessary to reach strategic levels of self-
supply. (...)”°

374. This is, therefore, a legitimate public policy with constitutional status, as it is established in the
Respondent’s Constitution.

375. Nevertheless, the Tribunal does not find in the Decree any express reference to food security nor to

the Organic Law of Food Security and Sovereignty, the purpose of which is precisely to protect
391

food security.””’ The justification was used for the first time in the public statements made by some
Ministers after the Expropriation Decree and has subsequently been used in the Respondent’s
filings.

376. For their part, at the Hearing both Mr. Sarmiento,*” a representative of the Republic during the

transition perio

d°** and later President of Venvidrio, and Mr. Cabrera,°%* expert witness for the

Respondent, confirmed that food security was not a motivating factor for the expropriation.

377. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that food security cannot serve as justification that the
expropriation of the Plants was made in the public interest.

Infringement of Free Competition

378. The Expropriation Decree also states among its whereas clauses, the following:

“WHEREAS
Activities that involve an abuse of the dominant position and that may infringe on express conditions

of competition in the economy are contrary to the fundamental principles of the Constitution of the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,

WHEREAS,

That the Owen [sic] Illinois corporation has been carrying out practices that infringe on the exercise
of free competition, thereby affecting other producers,

WHEREAS,

It is the duty of the State to adopt the necessary measures to prevent the injurious and restrictive
effects of the abuse of the dominant position and other behaviors that could degenerate into
monopolistic practices which are contrary to the fundamental principles of our social State based on
the rule of law"

379. The Claimant challenges that in spite of the fact that the Expropriation Decree is based on alleged
infringements of the exercise of free competition, no credible evidence has been presented to

support

these accusations,” nor have the Venezuelan authorities investigated and/or issued any

decision convicting the Claimant. Furthermore, the Claimant argues that the alleged infringements

of free competition”? can only be penalized by the Superintendence for the Protection and
Promotion of Free Competition and do not justify the expropriation.“

It is a fact that the Companies were the main prodi in the glass iners market; it is possible,
although no evidence has been brought forth to support this, that the Companies had a dominant
position in that market. What there is no evidence of is that the Companies abused their dominant
position—which is the only offense penalized by anti-trust regulations.

 

. In any case, even if the Companies had a dominant position, this would never justify such an

extreme measure as expropriation: experts for both Parties agree in that the expropriation could not
be carried out exclusively to remedy an alleged position of dominance on the part of the
Claimant.“*'

Moreover, it is very significant that Venezuelan authorities who defend free competition have not
investigated the accusation contained in Whereas Five of the Expropriation Decree and that there is
no resolution that supports it.

For this reason, the Tribunal deems that the Respondent has not proven that the alleged position of
dominance of the Companies in the Venezuelan glass market can be considered a factor of public
interest that justifies the expropriation.

In summary, the Tribunal finds that the Republic nationalized the Claimant’s investment in an

attempt to favor endogenous development, which allows it to consider the requirement of “public
interest” established in Art. 6 of the BIT to have been met.

b. The expropriation was carried out in compliance with due legal process

Art. 6(a) of the BIT requires that in order for an expropriation to be considered legitimate, it must
be adopted

“in accordance with due legal process.”
The Claimant asserts that by carrying out the expropriation, Venezuela has not only violated the

international standard of due process, but has also violated its domestic law, which would constitute
a prima facie violation of due process.*” For its part, Venezuela asserts that a simple

violation of domestic law is not sufficient to trigger a breach of art. 6(a) of the BIT.“

Unlike other Treaties,’ which expressly require the expropriation proceeding to be carried out in
accordance with the domestic law of the expropriating State, Art. 6(a) of the Venezuela—
Netherlands BIT does not do so. The article does not refer specifically to the regulations of the
expropriating State, but to due process“”* in general, a generic concept which must be interpreted
in accordance with the requirements of international Law; it is this minimum regulatory standard
commonly accepted in all States under the rule of law which guarantees the subject that any
decision affecting it will be adopted after having gone through a fair and equitable process.‘°°

Therefore, in the matter of expropriation the Court must limit itself to analyzing whether
Venezuela has satisfied the requirement of due process, as it is understood in international Law,
without making an evali of Li with internal V ‘Jan Law. (The allegati
of the Complainant regarding non- compliance with the LECUPS with respect to the unlawful
execution of the Decree of Expropriation and with respect to the irregular occupation of the
Plants may constitute violations of the standard of fair and equitable treatment and will be
analyzed in the next Chapter).

The Complainant has identified four possible violations of due process:
- The lack of prior notification;*””
- The right to be heard prior to the expropriation;

- The inaccurate identification of the property expropriated;*”

and
- The lack of knowledge of the expropriation measure implementation plan.*!°

Notification, right to be heard, implementation plan

The Complainant asserts that prior to the expropriation of the Plants the Republic never advised
the Companies with respect to the alleged violations of environmental, labor or free competition

legislation, and that they were never given the opportunity to argue their defense.‘'’ For its
part, the Republic denies that the requirements of due process in international Law require
advance notification of the expropriation to the affected party.‘"?

The Tribunal concurs with the Respondent insofar as no general principle of international Law
exists which requires the appropriating State to notify the expropriated party in advance of its
decision.*'? There are imaginable situations—e.g., the midst of a food crisis or a collapse of
financial markets—in which immediacy is essential to achieve the objectives sought in the public
interest and in which prior notification would frustrate the operation. For those same reasons,
international Law cannot recognize an absolute right to the investor to be heard and make
allegations prior to the State executing the expropriation measure or to know the execution plan
to be adopted.

The requirements of international Law with respect to due process in the expropriation of
property owned by foreigners falls more within a grey area: they do not require ex ante
notification, but rather the possibility of being able to resort ex post to an independent authority.
What is essential is that the decision adopted by the expropriating State can be reviewed
subsequently by a legal Authority which does not belong to the Executive Branch. And, In
Venezuelan Law, this requirement is satisfied: the LECUPS is a modern and protective law which
affords legal protection to the expropriated party, and which permits the Judge to review the
administrative expropriation action and determine the valuation owed to the expropriated party
due to its loss of equity.“

Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the decision of the Republic to order the expropriation of
the Plants by means of the ex-parte enactment of the Expropriation decree, which was issued
under the LECUPS, in itself is compatible with the requirement of BIT article 6(a), that the
decision has been taken

“in accordance with due legal process.”

Whether the Republic met or failed to meet the due process requirements pursuant to the LECUPS
[Law for Expropriation for Public or Social Interest] is another matter. Failure to meet said
requirements could constitute a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard guaranteed by
the BIT, a matter we shall discuss in the following Chapter.

Certainty regarding the object of the expropriation

The Claimant also argues that an essential component of due process, required by international
Law, is that the party whose property is expropriated must know, with certainty, which assets the
State is forcibly acquiring. The Tribunal shares this view: if the expropriation order, which may

have been issued inaudita parte, did not clearly and with certainty define which assets are to be
expropriated, this would allow the Executive Branch to determine, at its discretion, what set of
assets would be expropriated and this would undermine the investor’s right to obtain an
independent review of the decision.

396. And on this point, the expropriation measure adopted by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
shows significant weaknesses.

397. Article 1 of the Expropriation Decree decrees the forcible sequicition of the movable and real
property and imp ing to the OldV i pany. However, h a) of
the same article includes the Valera Plant among the property expropriated, which was not part of
the OldV’s property, but rather was owned by an independent company, Favianca. (OldV merely
held a minority interest in Favianca).

 

398. Moreover, Art. 1 in fine of the Decree includes an extensive clause that expropriates the following:

“{a]ny other tangible assets that form a part of the commercial company Owens
Illinois de Venezuela, C.A. that are necessary to achieve the purpose of the work,
which is the «Reinforcement of the public sector’s industrial capacity for the
production of glass containers»“*!*

399. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant’s legal expert in that the definition of the assets expropriated
in Article 1 of the Decree is ambiguous, excessively broad and leaves it entirely unclear whether
the property expropriated covers the property of OldV alone, or whether the company as a whole is
being expropriated, including its assets and liabilities.

400. The imprecise language of the Decree prevented the Claimant from knowing precisely which of its
assets would be expropriated, and as such, violated its right to due process. This concern is also
shared by the Respondent’s expert.‘'®

“!S Expropriation Decree Art. 1 in fine.

“'° Mr. Cabrera stated: (HT, day 4, 81:4-16): “PRESIDENT OF THE TRIBUNAL: But with the liabilities, if you
think, you believe that Owens’ liabilities, OJdV doesn’t have to pay the liabilities, it doesn’t have to pay them. The
liabilities, 1 am unclear about the liabilities. If the liabilities are part of the expropriation, or they go, as Mr. Moore
said, with the goodwill, and it is actually the company including all of its assets and liabilities that is being
expropriated. Do you see my confusion?

A. [Sr. Cabrera]. Yes, yes, I’m confused by the same thing. Because if I go by the Expropriation Decree, this is a
collection of property that constitute a company, and said company is going to continue to operate with this
property, and that’s why a board of directors was appointed. Now, at no time does it take into account the assets or
liabilities of the original owner of the property which still exists, which would be Owens. And in reality I cannot
answer that question.”

In response to the President of the Tribunal’s question with regard to what had been expropriated, Mr. Hernandez
responded (Spanish Record, day 4, 50:27-31): “Well, I admit that when I drafted my report that was one of the most
difficult matters to understand, because it was never clear, in my opinion, what exactly was being expropriated.
Article 1 of the Expropriation Decree talks about Owens Illinois de Venezuela. But later when it lists the property to
be expropriated, it includes property owned by a company, Favianca, that isn’t listed in the first Decree.”

OI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

The uncertainty regarding exactly which property was being expropriated persisted throughout the
expropriation process. The application for advance provisional remedy filed by the Attorney
General listed companies and offices‘'’ among the tangible assets owned by OldV that do not
appear on the Expropriation Decree and in the prayer for relief requested the seizure of all the
property of the Companies and “their subsidiaries.*’* The decision of the First Administrative
Court to grant the provisional remedy consisting of said seizure, compounded the error by ordering
the seizure of property that was not listed in the Expropriation Decree.*!”

Moreover, despite the fact that the Expropriation Decree only lists certain property and
imp . the dent actually expropriated the ‘ing and business activity in
which both companies owned by OIEG were engaging in Venezuela. The Respondent took over
not only the property comprising the Los Guayos and Valera Plants, but also

- The goodwill of OldV and Favianca;*”°
- The cash deposited into the bank accounts held by OldV and Favianca;*”!
- The technology and the know-how used at the glass manufacturing Plants.

In summary, the Tribunal considers it to be a proven fact that in the Expropriation Decree and the
subsequent legal action, the Respondent failed to clearly identify the property subject to
expropriation, the definition of which constitutes a basic guarantee of due process required by
international Law. As such, the Republic has violated “due process of law” in violation of Article
6(a) of the BIT.

c. The expropriation was not discriminatory

The Claimant claims that Venezuela expropriated the Companies specifically because they were
foreign investments, and points to the express reference to the nationality of OI in the
announcement made by President Chavez” and in the statements made by Minister Menéndez and

Vice President Jaua.“”* Moreover, it claims that the expropriation had the effect of eliminating

foreign participation in the glass container manufacturing industry, since other companies in the
sector were not expropriated.“ The Respondent, on the other hand, claims that the expropriation
was not discriminatory with regard to its motivation or effect,"** and was unrelated to the
nationality of OI.’ In fact, the reference made to its nationality by President Chavez was merely
incidental and isolated.‘”’

Article 6(b) of the BIT prohibits discriminatory expropriations. Discrimination requires more than
different treatment. In order for it to exist, similar cases must be treated differently without
justification.“7*

The Claimant argues that it was expropriated because it was an investment owned by U.S.
nationals, but merely states some presumptions in defense of its theory, which cannot be considered
sound proof of its argument:

First of all, it argues that President Chavez, in his speech announcing the expropriation added the
tagline “a company with U.S. capital” after the name “Owens-Illinois.” This simple obiter dictum
does not appear to be sufficient to justify the claim that the US nationality of the OI group was a
decisive factor in the decision to expropriate. Moreover, as the Respondent correctly points out,’??
the claim that Venezuela expropriated its investment specifically because it was foreign and
American, contradicts its other argument that the true purpose of the expropriation was to cause
damage to Polar Group.”

 

Secondly, the references made by Minister Menéndez and Vice President Jaua on 26 October 2010
can hardly be classified as discriminatory.

Vice President Jaua announced the passage of the Expropriation Decree and in response to a
question from a reporter, stated that the government was acting in the defense of the public interest,
in clear contrast with what other previous governments had done,**' which had allowed the “neo-
colonialization by transnational companies, particularly American companies”—a statement of a
political and historical nature that cannot be classified as an indication of discrimination. For his

part, Minister Menéndez did not even mention the nationality of the Claimant, but merely stated
that

“(...) it is in the interest of the collective that... a product ... as essential as a container
in which a product consumed by every Venezuelan is packaged, cannot be part of a
monopoly held by one economic group, much less by a transnational.”**”

The Tribunal has already established the conclusion that the Republic expropriated the Plants to
promote endogenous development, a legitimate public policy that it may implement in the manner
it believes best serves the common good, even via expropriations and nationalizations. In the
decision to expropriate, the decisive factor appears to have been the expropriated Companies were
operating in the glass manufacturing sector in which the Venezuelan Government wished to
implement said policy—and not the U.S. nationality of the OI group.

Moreover, given that OI had more than 60% of the market share of the glass container
manufacturing industry," its expropi cannot be und d to i iscrimination in
favor of domestic investors, but rather a strategic decision. The expropriation of the company
ensured that the government would control the largest share of the glass container manufacturing
sector—considered by the Republic to be strategic for its endogenous development policy.‘

Therefore, the Tribunal does not consider it to have been proven that the expropriation was carried
out for discriminatory reasons.

d. Prior (or against) just compensation

The Claimant claims that the expropriation cannot be legitimate, since despite the fact that over
four years have passed, it has received no compensation whatsoever for the assets of which it was
deprived.‘

The Respondent for its part, acknowledges that it must compensate the Claimant with the just
market value of its share in OldV y Favianca**® and that it has not yet done so,**” but points out that
Article 6(c) of the BIT does not require payment of compensation to be immediate, but rather
“without undue delay.” The Respondent claims that the procedure provided by the LECUPS
adheres to the provisions of Article 6(c) of the BIT** and is currently at the stage in which the fair
value is being set.*”

‘Award

Article 6(c) of the BIT

. Article 6(c) of the BIT, in the Spanish version, requires that the expropriation measure be taken

“with prior just compensation.” According to the literal wording, the law requires that just
compensation precede the dispossession of the expropriated investor.

However, this reading of the Spanish version does not match the English and Dutch versions of the
Treaty: they require that the expropriation be carried out “against just compensation” in English,
and “tegen een billijke schadeloosstelling” in Dutch. This language requires the payment of just
compensation—but fails to define the moment at which said compensation must be paid. There is,
then, a clear contradiction between the different versions of the BIT—which according to the
closing of the Treaty are “equally authentic.”

How do we resolve this contradiction? The Protocol contains a rule to settle this question: Point 3
establishes that

“the English version shall be taken as a reference.”

The correct interpretation of the Treaty is then that the expropriation must be carried out “against
just compensation.” This wording allows the expropriation to take place without prior payment, but
requires payment to be made at some undefined future date, which Article 6 of the BIT in fine
defines by ordering that the compensation

“shall be paid and made transferable without undue delay.”
Proven Facts
The following are proven facts:

(i) The expropriation procedure under the LECUPS is still moving through the Venezuelan
Administrative Courts and no final decision has as yet been rendered. These proceedings, in which
neither the companies nor the Claimant are participating,” began on 14 March 2011 as a result of
the request for expropriation filed by the Attorney General’s Office, and is currently being
processed by the Second Administrative Court.*' As of the date of the award, there is no evidence
the fair value has been determined nor has the Claimant received any compensation whatsoever.

(ii) Between January and July of 2011 the Companies and the Respondent held four meetings out of
court for purposes of determining the proper compensation. Given the vast differences between the
two parties—the Claimant valued 100% of the Companies at just over USD 1 billion, while the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela counter-offered a range of between USD 100-120 million—the
meetings broke down without any agreement.

ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

The Tribunal’s Decision

. The Tribunal has already established that the LECUPS is a modern law, compliance with which in

principle meets the requirements of Article 6(c) of the BIT. However, given that the process began
nearly four years ago and the fair value has still not been set, much less any compensation paid,
does this delay constitute “undue delay,” which would violate the express provision of Article 6(c)
in fine of the BIT?

The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela acknowledges that it owes compensation to Ol Group and
that the value of the expropriated property exceeds, based on Venezuela’s own calculations, USD
100 million—a significant sum by any account. The BIT requires that the Bolivarian Republic pay
compensation “without undue delay.” In order to meet this requirement, it would have been
appropriate for the procedure provided in the LECUPS to have moved forward without delay, and
that the fair value owed under said Law would have been established and paid—without prejudice
to the investor’s right to file a claim under the BIT, if it believed that, despite the payment made,
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela had not fully performed its obligations under international
law that it undertook in the Treaty.

The Respondent acknowledges that the legal proceedings in Venezuela have been drawn out, but it
justifies this by saying that the Claimant's failure to appear has made proper processing difficult.“
However, the experts for both parties confirmed at the hearing that the opposite is true.“? In
particular, the expert for the Respondent stated:

“CLAIMANT (Mr. Grané Labat).- Would you say that this means that the failure to
appear on the part of this, of this expropriated party would not stand in the way of
this legal proceeding contemplated by the Law for the purpose of paying the
compensation?

EXPERT (Mr. Cabrera).- It would not stand in the way.”*“*

Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that the Bolivarian Republic has failed to offer a plausible
explanation to justify the delay of more than four years in setting and paying the fair value due in
compliance with the LECUPS, which in turn implies that the requirement under Article 6(c) of the
BIT that the compensation be paid “without undue delay” has not been met.

ee

In summary, the Tribunal holds that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has not been able to
prove that the Expropriation Decree has complied with all the requirements set forth in Article 6 of
the BIT. Although this Tribunal has reached the conclusion that the expropriation was carried out in
the public interest, and is not discriminatory, Venezuela has failed to ensure due process of law, by

failing to precisely identify the property it intended to expropriate, and there has been excessive and
unjustified delay in the payment of the fair value due under the LECUPS. Therefore, the
expropriation of the Claimant’s investment is not in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty
and must be considered illegal.

ANCILLARY CLAIMS AND CONVERTIBILITY CLAIM

The Claimant considers it proven that the actions of the Respondent, in addition to constituting
expropriation measures, also constitute violations of art. 3(1), 3(2), 3(4), and 5 of the BIT. The
Claimant asserts that Venezuela, through the acts and omissions of its government agencies:

- has treated the Claimant’s investments in an unfair and inequitable manner, and has
hindered, by means of arbitrary and discriminatory measures, the operation, maintenance,
management, use, enjoyment and disposal of the investment, in violation of art. 3(1) of
the BIT;

- has failed to grant full physical security and protection to the Claimant’s investments, in
violation of art. 3(2) of the BIT;

- has failed to comply with the obligations assumed by it with respect to the treatment of
the investments, in violation of art. 3(4) of the BIT [“Umbrella Clause”);

- and has failed to guarantee that the payments related to the Claimant’s investments can be
transferred in a freely convertible currency, in violation of art. 5 of the BIT, all such facts
being attributable to Venezuela.

The first three claims will be referred to as the “Ancillary Claims.”

The Claimant considers that each breach of the BIT is independent and cannot be legally
incorporated into the other breaches“? and that each one grants it the right to petition for a
declaratory judgment and to obtain full compensation for the totality of the damages (including
moral damages) caused.‘*° Notwithstanding, hic et nunc, it does not claim any amount
whatsoever, with the exception of moral damages, with respect to the Ancillary Claims.

The Respondent denies that Venezuela has violated articles 3(1), 3(2), 3(4), and 5 of the BIT.” It
adds that in the event the Tribunal decides that a wrongful expropriation has occurred, the
analysis of the Ancillary Claims would be superfluous, since all the damages

claimed by the Claimant, with the exception of one (moral damages) are incorporated in the
expropriation compensation.“*

Analysis of the Tribunal

The Tribunal has reached the conclusion that the Bolivarian Republic has expropriated the
Claimant’s investment located in Venezuela in violation of the Treaty, an action which, in
accordance with the provisions set forth in art. 6(c) of the BIT requires the Respondent to pay fair
compensation which “represents the market value of the investments affected,” plus interest “at a
normal commercial rate through the date of payment.”

The Respondent agrees that, from the theoretical standpoint, a certain conduct can constitute one
or several violations of the BIT. However, it adds that in this case, once the conclusion that a
wrongful expropriation has occurred is reached, the analysis of the Ancillary Claims would be
unnecessary, since all damages claimed by the Claimant—with the exception of moral
damages—would arise as a result of the wrongful expropriation.

Despite the fact that the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent in that the analysis of the Ancillary
Claims would probably be futile in practical terms, its request cannot be granted:

- First, because the Tribunal must make a fully informed assessment of the possible
existence of moral damages,

- and also, because the Claimant has expressly and repeatedly requested a declaratory
judgment.

Therefore, the Tribunal proceeds to analyze, albeit briefly, the Ancillary Claims.
BREACH OF ART. 3(1): OF THE BIT: FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT
Claimant’s Position

The Claimant considers that the Respondent violated the standard of fair and equitable treatment
[“FET”] set forth in art. 3(1) of the BIT.“”

In the first place, the Claimant considers that the Bolivarian Republic misinterprets the FET
standard established in the Treaty, since it attempts to equate the FET standard in the BIT with
the i i inimum standard of “8° OEIG considers that neither art. 3(1) of the

Award

BIT nor art. 3(1) of the BIT Protocol link or limit the FET standard in the BIT to the minimum
standard of treatment of customary international Law.

The Claimant asserts that to violate the FET standard in the BIT, it is sufficient for the conduct of
the Respondent to show “a relatively lower degree of impropriety.”**! Nevertheless, the Claimant
alleges that, if the applicable standard were the minimum standard in accordance with
international Law, which requires the conduct to “show a relatively higher degree of inadequacy,”
the conclusion would be the same; the Respondent’s conduct was so flagrant, and with so great a
degree of impropriety that there is no doubt that the treatment afforded to the Claimant’s
investment was neither fair nor equitable and, therefore, the Respondent violated art. 3(1) of the
Bir“?

FET

The Claimant reports numerous acts and omissions by the Republic which violate the FET
standard. In particular, the Claimant considers it proven that Venezuela:

- Through its officials, coerced the personnel of the Companies and engaged in a campaign
of harassment against OldV and Favianca;

- Acted in an arbitrary manner with respect to the Claimant’s investments;

- Has utilized its power for an improper purpose;

- Violated the legitimate expectations of the Claimant;

- Denied the Claimant and the Companies due process and procedural justice;
- Has treated the Claimant’s investment in a discriminatory manner;

- Has failed to comply with its duty to act in a transparent manner; and

- Has not acted in good faith with respect to the Claimant.

The following paragraphs briefly summarize the Claimant’s allegations with respect to such acts
of non-compliance.

The coercion of Companies’ personnel

The Claimant asserts that the Respondent violated the FET standard by coercing, threatening and
harassing the Companies’ personnel as of the time of the expropriation.“** According to the

Claimant, the threat of treating “saboteurs,”4* ruthlessly, issued in a context of a military
occupation of the Plants“*® instilled fear in the personnel and had the desired effect; it obligated
the Companies’ personnel to remain in their positions and operate the Plants to the exclusive

benefit of the Respondent.**

Reasons for the expropriation

440.  OIEG alleges that Venezuela has acted in an arbitrary manner in general,“*’ but particularly
emphasizes that the expropriation was arbitrary,*** because it never offered any plausible, clear
and coherent justification’ and because it took control of the Plants without having a clear plan
for the transition period.

Abuse of authority

441. | The Claimant adds that the Bolivarian Republic applied its laws for a purpose other than that for
which they were created.“*' Thus, the Claimant holds that the Respondent violated art. 3(1) of the
BIT because**

- It used the Venezuelan expropriation procedure illegally to sanction violations of free
competition which were never proven;

- It usurped the legal authority of the Superintendence by sanctioning those violations;“*

- It utilized the INDEPABIS Law to deprive the Claimant and the Companies of the legal
protections afforded by the Expropriation Law.“

Legitimate expectations

442. Furthermore, the Claimant considers that the lack of a proceeding prior to the expropriation with
respect to the charges of environmental damage, workforce exploitation or breach of the right to
competition through the Courts or administrative proceedings, and contrary to the provisions of
Venezuelan Law, constitutes a violation of the legitimate expectations of OIEG with respect to

the treatment its investments would receive. Likewise, the Claimant alleges that the non-
compliance with the Investments Law (which sets forth the obligation of fair and equitable
treatment, non-discrimination and compensation for expropriation) also frustrated its legitimate
expectations, in violation of the FET standard.‘”

Due Process

The Claimant considers it to be proven that the Respondent deliberately denied the Claimant the
right to due process and procedural justice to which its investments are entitled.4* In addition to
the violations of due process identified in the preceding section, the Claimant considers that the

following conduct on the part of the Respondent violated the obligation of FET contained in the
BIT:

- The lack of prior notification of the expropriation;

- The “obscurity” in the declaration and execution of the Expropriation Decree and the
successive delays by the Respondent to put an end to the period of forced labor in the
Plants.‘”

- The threats by the Respondent to the Companies’ personnel to charge them with
“sabotage,” without clarifying the meaning of that concept or indicating any law or

penalty which would sanction such conduct;

- The execution of burdensome audits which exceeded the jurisdiction of the supervising
authorities, obtaining court orders in violation of Venezuelan Law and forcing the
Cc ‘ies to partici in the collecti ini iations despite the
expropriation.‘

 

The Claimant considers that the actions by the Respondent are contrary to the provisions in AJG
with respect to the fact that due process requires the absence of arbitrariness,‘ and denies that, as
indicated by the Respondent, it is required to exhaust all legal remedies available to it in
Venezuela, since no obligation exists under the BIT or the ICSID agreement to litigate violations
of due process in national law courts.‘ Therefore, it considers that the actions described
constitute a violation of international Law and, specifically, the FET standard.

Award

Discrimination

The Claimant also argues that the Respondent implemented measures which were discriminatory,
both in intent and effect. First, it considers that the context, tone and language of the
announcement by President Chavez demonstrates that the expropriation was carried out for
political and discriminatory reasons,’”* a fact which can also be noted in the statements by
Minister Menéndez and Vice President Jaua.”” Secondly, the Claimant holds that the Respondent
has admitted that no other expropriations have occurred in the glass sector, for which reason
Venezuela has treated the Claimant’s investments in a discriminatory manner in comparison with
any other company in the glass production sector,‘”* and therefore, in an unfair and inequitable
manner.’”?

Transparency

The Claimant asserts that the statements during the Hearing confirmed that the Respondent failed
to comply with its duty to act in a transparent manner, which constitutes a violation of art. 3(1) of
the BIT. This duty required the Respondent to make decisions which could affect the Claimant
based on a known and understandable legal framework, and that it act in a transparent manner in
its administrative processes.**° Nevertheless, the Respondent failed to comply with its duty to act
in a transparent and honest manner because:

- The Expropriation was carried out without prior notification to the Claimant;**!

> The Respondent has been unable to provide a coherent justification for the
expropriation;*”

- The Respondent failed to identify, in a clear and coherent manner, the property
expropriated:“**

- The lack of transparency during the Plant occupation period (from October 2010 through
April 2011), which is manifested, for example, in the numerous and diverse requirements
made by several authorities, the establishment of periods for finalizing the period of
forced labor which were repeatedly unmet.***

- The failure to provide minutes or any document regarding the meeting of the Cabinet
Ministers on 26 October 2010, at which the Expropriation Decree was approved, despite
the order of the Court to produce such documents.“

- Obtaining the ex parte order dated 20 December 2010 is derived from an abuse of power
and is in violation of significant provisions of Venezuelan law.**°

Good faith

In addition, OIEG holds that Venezuela has violated the principle of acting in good faith, which it
considers “inherent to FET.”**’ The Claimant considers that the following conduct on the part of
Venezuela, individually, and more so together, constitute convincing evidence that the
Respondent did not act in good faith, in violation of art. 3(1) of the BIT:

- The spond jated the C ies without ip ion and without a
legitimate public interest. In particular, the Respondent’s apparent concern for “food
supply safety” in Venezuela is contradicted by the fact that the Respondent now exports
glass containers to Brazil;***

 

- It utilized the Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) to take physical possession of the
Plants;*®°

- It forced the employees to accede to its demands under the threat of accusing them of
“sabotage”*”?

= It carried out a campaign of harassment against the Companies, initiating multiple audits
49)

and investigations
- It failed to notify the legal proceedings directly related to the Companies and disclosed
Envidrio confidential and proprietary information.‘

Finally, the Claimant considers it to be proven that the Respondent acted in an arbitrary and
discriminatory manner, in violation of the FET standard, and asserts that the same arbitrary and
discriminatory conduct has hindered the OIEG investments, in violation of art. 3(1) of the BIT in
fine.

The Claimant therefore concludes that the Respondent has violated the FET standard and that, by
means of arbitrary and discriminatory measures has hindered the functioning, operation,
management, maintenance, usage, enjoyment and disposal of the Claimant’s investments, in

violation of the provisions set forth in art. 3(1) of the BIT.“

Respondent’s Position

The Respondent denies having treated the Claimant in an unfair and inequitable manner, and that
the post-expropriation conduct of the Republic has been discriminatory and arbitrary, and
therefore does not constitute a violation of art. 3(1) of the BIT.

First, the Republic argues that the threshold for determining that the FET standard has been
violated is high.** The Republic asserts the application of the FET standard defined in Waste
Management, which reaffirms that the violation of the FET is reserved to a conduct which is:

“arbitrary, grossly unfair, unreasonable or idiosyncratic, discriminatory, and which
exposes the Claimant to sectorial o racial damages or implies a lack of due process the
result of which is contrary to legal decency."

That is, the Respondent argues that its conduct must be subject to a relatively higher degree of
impropriety,” advocating that the appli standard be ined with due to the
State.*** Furthermore, the Respondent rejects an abstract application of the standard and,
therefore, requests an analysis be made of the specific circumstances of the case."”

 

The Respondent concludes that in no case has its conduct implied an unfair or inequitable
treatment to the Claimant, regardless of the standard used.

Coercion of personnel

The Respondent characterizes as fictitious and fabricated ex profeso for the arbitration proceeding
the allegations by the Claimant that Venezuela coerced OldV personnel to carry out a prolonged
period of forced labor.” The Respondent rejects those allegations based on the following
arguments:

- No evidence whatsoever exists of the alleged coercion, since none of the correspondence
during that period drafted under instructions from counsel and sent by OldV to the
Respondent mentions the matter;*’

- It has not been proven that the alleged coercion was the result of threats of accusations of

- The di y evidence that the Plant 1 ‘inued working

interfering with entries and departures and who only went inside the Plants to go to the

Reasons for the expropriation

Furthermore, Venezuela considers that the Claimant has failed to prove the alleged lack of
consistency in the Republic’s reasons for the expropriation, or that it was politically motivated, or
that the absence of preparatory documents can undermine the validity of the reasons set forth in
the Expropriation decree. Therefore, it denies the Claimant’s allegations that Venezuela’s conduct
was arbitrary.*!5

Abuse of power

The Republic asserts that at no time has it used its power for inappropriate purposes. Venezuela
considers it to be proven that the expropriation was carried out with a specific and legitimate
objective, and that no basis whatsoever exists for the Claimant’s allegations that INDEPABIS and
INPSASEL committed abuse of power or acted with the intention of causing harm to the
Claimant.*!*

Legitimate Expectations

Likewise, the Respondent alleges that the claim by the Claimant that its legitimate expectations
were frustrated cannot succeed. The Republic argues that OIEG has not even attempted to
demonstrate that it relied on specific commitments or regulations when it made its alleged
investment, or that any Venezuelan legal regulation has been modified or interpreted to its
detriment.*””

Due Process
The Respondent holds that it has not denied due process or procedural justice to the Claimant or
the Companies. Venezuela considers the following facts to be proven, which in its opinion

prevent the Claimant from alleging violation of the FET Standard:

- The expropriation was not based on environmental, labor or right to competition

reasons;

- There are no grounds for the allegations by the Claimant of forced labor, disorganization

- The ex parte order authorizing the occupation of the Plants was issued in accordance with

Discrimination and Good Faith

Likewise, Venezuela denies that the expropriation was carried out due to the national origin of the
Claimant and therefc i that the i of discrimination against the Claimant
should be dismissed.**!

Finally, Venezuela asserts that its actions have been transparent and in good faith. In particular it
considers proven that:

- The expropriation and the ex parte occupation order were foreseeable as a legitimate
exercise of the power of the Bolivarian Republic under Venezuelan Law;*”

- The Claimant has failed to demonstrate that it acted on the assumption that INDEPABIS
and INPSASEL would not carry out audits, that fines would not be imposed or that the
Supervision Period would not be extended;*”?

- The evidence demonstrates that the Claimant did not challenge the expropriation or its
implementation as being contrary to Venezuelan law, but rather it recognized its
under V ‘lan law and und k to in good faith;**

 

- The expropriation was carried out to guarantee food safety and the endogenous
development policy of the Republic, and the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that any
other reason existed;

7 The commissioning of the Envidrio Report and the disclosure of Plant technical
information to third parties was necessary given the deteriorated condition of the Plants
and, in particular, their furnaces.

In short, the Respondent denies having violated in any way the FET standard during the transition
period and considers that the Claimant has grouped all the trivialities which then occurred and has
characterized them as international unlawful acts.°?>

considers that the Claimant’s claim should be dismissed for reasons identical to those already set
forth in this section.*°

In view of all the arguments, the Respondent concludes that all the claims put forward by the
Claimant with respect to alleged violations of art. 3(1) of the BIT should be dismissed.

Analysis of the Tribunal

In its arguments and in its petition, the Claimant proposes that the same events that led to the
expropriation of its investment—which have already been analyzed in the previous section—
constitute an additional international illegal act of unfair and inequitable treatment sanctioned by
the Treaty. However, as has been indicated, the Claimant is claiming no additional compensation
for these alleged violations: the compensation requested for the expropriation of its investment
also includes the damage caused by these illegal acts, with the exception of moral damages.
OIEG is suing for USD 10 million for moral damages stemming from what it refers to as the
Respondents atrocious conduct™’ during the six months following the expropriation.

The Respondent, for its part, denies the existence of unfair or inequitable treatment and any
arbitrary or discriminatory measures.

Determining of the scope of analysis

The Claimant includes in the alleged violation of the standard of FET not only the actions that
resulted in the takeover of the Plants, but also the actions of INPSASEL and INDEPABIS, two.
State agencies, as well as those of the Judicial Branch of the Venezuelan government.

To resolve this issue, the Tribunal shall first determine what standard of protection is established
by the Treaty (A). Once the standard of protection has been clarified, the question of whether the
events constitute a violation of the standard of FET can be analyzed (B).

Definition of the standard of FET in the BIT

Throughout the arbitration, the Republic has insisted that the scope of the guarantee of FET
defined in the BIT is limited to the minimum standard of treatment of Customary International
Law. In support of its thesis, it has invoked the verbatim text of item 2 of the Protocol, which uses
the adverb “as well as” to indicate that the notion of FET must be analyzed from the perspective
of both the most favored nation and the minimum standard of treatment of foreign nationals under
international law.°**

Award

The Claimant’s understanding, on the other hand, is that the standard reflected in article 3(1) of
the BIT and item 2 of the Protocol does not coincide with the minimum customary treatment, but
instead represents an autonomous and broader contractual standard. In its opinion, article 3(1) of
the BIT does not tie the standard of FET to the minimum standard of treatment of customary
international law, nor does item 2 of the Protocol introduce such a limitation.*”° (In any case, the
Claimant maintains that even if the minimum customary standard of treatment is applied, the
result would be the same: the Respondent’s conduct was so blatant that it also violated the less
demanding standard**’).

FET in the BIT and its Protocol

The obligation to accord FET to protected investments is recognized in article 3(1) of the BIT and
item 2 of its Protocol.

Article 3(1) of the BIT establishes the following:
“1, Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments of
nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by arbitrary or
iscrimi y the i i use, enjoy or
disposal thereof by those nationals.”
The BIT thus contains two rules:

— On the one hand, it ensures FET of the protected investments.

— And, furthermore, it prohibits arbitrary or discriminatory measures against protected
investors.

The regulation of article 3(1) of the BIT is supplemented by item 2 of the Protocol, which sets out
the following:

international law, whichever is more favorable to the national concerned.”

Thus, the standard orders that the treatment accorded to a protected investor shall be fair and
equitable if it conforms:

— “to the treatment accorded to national [Venezuelan] investments or

— as well as to the minimum standard for the treatment of foreign nationals under international
Jaw,

whichever is more favorable to the [protected Dutch investor].”
What is the exact meaning of this vague provision?

Article 31(1) of the VCLT requires treaties to be interpreted “in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context.”

Applying this interpretative principle, the Spanish text of the BIT proves vague, since it seems to

require the guarantee of FET to be accorded in accordance with the standard most favorable to the

investor, from among the following:

— the treatment accorded to national investments

— the treatment to investments of nationals of third States and

— the minimum standard of Customary International Law.

However, the English text is written in a totally different way:
“The Contracting Parties agree that the treatment of investments shall be considered to
be fair and equitable as mentioned in Article 3, paragraph 1, if it conforms to the
treatment accorded to investments of their own nationals, or to investments of nationals
of any third State, whichever is more favorable to the national concerned, as well as to

the minimum standard for the treatment of foreign nationals under international law.”

In the English version, it is clear that the treatment accorded to the investment shall be fair and
equitable if it satisfies a dual requirement:

— If the treatment confirms to the treatment accorded to investments of nationals or investments
of third States, applying the most favorable of the two alternatives, and

- Additionally (“as well as”) to the minimum standard for the treatment of foreign nationals
under international law.

What to do to resolve this conflict of authority? The Protocol contains a rule to resolve this issue:
item 3 establishes that:

“the English text shall be taken as a reference.”

Therefore, the regulation of FET envisaged in the English version of item 2 of the Protocol shall
prevail. In practical terms, this regulation implies that the FET guaranteed by the BIT

—  Asageneral rule, shall equate to the minimum customary standard;

— Unless the investor is able to prove that the treatment guaranteed for the investments of
nationals or third States is superior.

United Kingdom — Venezuela Treaty

The Claimant has attempted to avail itself of this exception, arguing that the standard of treatment
established in the Treaty between the United Kingdom and Venezuela is indeed superior. Article
2(2) of that Treaty indicates that

“(il of nationals or ies of each Ci ‘ing Party shall at all times be
accorded fair and equitable treatment in accordance with international law.”**!

 

 

 

The Tribunal does not agree with this assessment: it is not true that the Treaty with the United
Kingdom offers superior treatment to the minimum customary standard, since in reality it only
offers protected investors FET “in accordance with international law.” The Treaty therefore does
not guarantee FET in abstract, but rather only as recognized by international law. And the level of
protection that international law offers and ensures to foreign nationals is precisely what is known
as the minimum customary standard.

In short, the Tribunal concludes that hic et nunc the general rule should be applied, and that the
standard of FET enjoyed by the Claimant in relation to its investments in Venezuela is the
minimum customary standard (or to use the terminology of the Protocol to the BIT, “the
minimum standard for the treatment of foreign nationals under international law”).

Minimum customary standard

What should be understood by minimum standard of treatment to foreign nationals guaranteed by
Customary International Law?

The issue is fraught with difficulties because there is no consistent case law. Furthermore, it
becomes necessary to make distinctions, taking into account the varying nature of actions that
generate international liability on the part of the State.

The first formulation of the standard of FET seems to have been the one adopted in Roberts,*>* an
arbitral decision rendered in 1926 by the General Claims Commission of the United States and
Mexico, which prosecuted the actions of Mexico’s Executive Branch and defined the minimum

standard as that which is required “in accordance with ordinary standards of civilization. "°°

Mr. Roberts, an American, had been imprisoned in Mexico under what he understood to be
inhumane conditions. Mexico argued that Mexican citizens were imprisoned under identical
conditions. And the Tribunal decided as follows:

“Facts with respect to equality of treatment of aliens and nationals may be important in
determining the merits of a complaint of mistreatment of an alien. But such equality is not
the ultimate test of the propriety of the acts of authorities in the light of international law.
That test is, broadly speaking, whether aliens are treated in accordance with ordin
standards of civilization. We do not hesitate to say that the treatment of Roberts was such
as to warrant an indemnity on the ground of cruel and inhumane imprisonment.”*™

The standard defined in Roberts (“in accordance with ordinary standards of civilization”) was
established in the 1920s, in a context of injury to a foreign citizen’s individual rights and of
prosecution of actions taken by the Executive Branch—not judicial actions or legislative actions.
Perhaps the most important thing about the award is the principle that an action attributable to the
State can generate international legal liability, despite the fact that the measures affect both
nationals and foreign nationals equally and even if there is no bad faith or willful breach of
obligations.

The minimum customary standard has not remained frozen. It has developed significantly since
its early formulations 100 years ago, driven by the establishment of Human Rights and the
implementation of the Rule of Law. Well into the 21" century, Roberts is of dubious relevance for
the protection of foreign investors against administrative, legislative or judicial actions that
interfere with the use and enjoyment of their investment. What is relevant is not the standard as it
was defined in the 20" century, but rather the standard as it exists and is accepted today—since
both Customary International Law and the standard itself are constantly evolving.*** And it is
quite possible that currently the minimum customary standard and the FET envisaged in the
treaties have converged, according the investor with substantially equivalent levels of protection.

Article 3(1) of the BIT should serve as a starting point in the task of unravelling the current
meaning of the standard. On the one hand, the precept outlines the general principle that the
investor will be ensured FET in accordance with the minimum international standard and,
moreover, it adds a specific prohibition: no State must adopt “arbitrary or discriminatory

measures” that affect “the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal” of
the investments.

What, then. should FET be taken to mean?

FET represents an indeterminate legal concept, which imposes a minimum standard of conduct on
all States with respect to foreign nationals. A State violates it when it takes an action or a chain of
actions that are demonstrably unlawful or fail to recognize the basic requirements of the rule of
law.**° The duty of according FET to foreign nationals is mentioned with respect to the State as a
whole, and it binds all branches that it comprises. The obligation of FET can be violated in the
following ways:

— Through administrative actions, taken by administrative authorities for which the State is
responsible, directly against the investor;

—  Oralso by means of judicial actions that affect the investor, if they involve a denial of justice;

~ Or lastly by means of general legislative actions, enacted by the State, if the new regulation
contradicts the investor’s legitimate expectations.

What should be understood by “arbitrary or discriminatory measures”?

The BIT not only mentions the guarantee of FET but also prohibits the adoption of “arbitrary or
discriminatory measures” that affect the investment.

It is not easy to define what arbitrary is. The fundamental idea of arbitrariness is that legality, due
process, the right to judicial remedy, objectivity and transparency in the State’s management are
replaced by privilege, preference, bias, preclusion and concealment.*” Professor Schreuer has
defined (and the EDF Tribunal has accepted®*) as arbitrary:

“a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate

purpose; a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or
personal preference; a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put
Sorward by the decision maker; a measure taken in willful disregard of due process and
proper procedure.”

58° Glamis stated in the same regard that violation of the customary minimum treatment requires that “/...] an act
must be sufficiently egregious and shocking — a gross denial of justice, manifest arbitrariness, blatant unfairness, a
complete lack of due process, evident discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons [...]” (Glamis, para. 616).

Discrimination, in turn, requires an investment to be treated differently from other investments,
without this being justified on any objective grounds; it requires a measure to affect one foreign
investor and not others, precisely on account of his foreign status, or on account of his belonging
to a certain ethic, religious or national group.**”

In short: In this case, the BIT requires the existence or non-existence of FET to be determined
according to the standard of treatment for foreign nationals imposed by international law and, in
particular, prohibits States from adopting arbitrary or discriminatory measures that may affect the
protected investment.

Application of the standard of FET to the facts

The Claimant asserts that the actions taken by Venezuelan authorities violated the guarantee of
FET and were arbitrary and discriminatory.

The Republic of Venezuela, for its part, denies that it has treated the Claimant unfairly and
inequitably and also denies that the Republic’s post-expropriation conduct has been
discriminatory and arbitrary, therefore constituting a violation of article 3(1) of the BIT.

The Tribunal will analyze each of the Claimant’s allegations below:

The expropriation

In para. 426 above, the Tribunal has already reached the conclusion that the expropriation was
unlawful because:

— Due process was not followed, upon failing to precisely identify the assets that it aimed to
expropriate, and

— The Bolivarian Republic has incurred an excessive and unjustified delay in payment of the
due compensation.

As the expropriation was unlawful, the Republic must have also breached the guarantee of FET,
since it proves difficult to imagine an unlawful direct expropriation that does not involve a
violation of that standard.*°

The actions of the INDEPABIS

The Claimant alleges that the temporary occupation and operational preventive measures issued
by the INDEPABIS constitute administrative acts which:

- deprive the Claimant and the Companies of the legal protections afforded by the
Expropriation Law,™” that is, an abuse of power;

- are a violation of its right to due process, being excessively burdensome,” and
- are a violation of Venezuelan law.**?

503. The Respondent denies that the actions of the INDEPABIS have violated national law“ or that
there has been any abuse of power.** In particular, the Republic asserts that:

- The occupation by the INDEPABIS did not violate art. 4 of the Expropriation Decree
since that article does not establish that the occupation be carried out by virtue of art. 56
of the Expropriation Law, but rather simply states that possibility;°°

- Contrary to the assertions by the Claimant, Venezuelan Law permits the occupation of
expropriated property without court authorization.™” In fact, art. 6(4) of the INDEPABIS
Law does not require court authorization for the occupation of expropriated property.*
‘Therefore, the INDEPABIS could occupy the Plants as of the publication of the
Expropriation Decree.”

- The INDEPABIS could elect to carry out the occupation either under the terms of art.
6(4) or art. 112(1) of the INDEPABIS Law;** it elected to do so by virtue of art. 112 due
to the existence of an objective situation of risk of production collapse or standstill;**'

- The Claimant did not challenge the expropriation or the subsequent occupation of the
Plants.°?

standard. To do so, it will explain the occupation system for expropriated property under

Venezuelan regulations (a), will recall the actions by the INDEPABIS, (b) and finally will reach a
decision (c).

(i) The ion system for expropriated property under law

The LECUPS is a protective law which protects the rights of the expropriated party. Therefore,
the occupation of expropriated property can only be ordered by the Courts (except when the
expropriated party gives its consent).*** The administration is lacking in jurisdiction to execute
the Expropriation Decree on its own initiative.

The judge can authorize the occupation at two moments in time: during the expropriation process
(“prior occupation”), or once the expropriation process is completed (“final occupation”).

The prior occupation is a provisional remedy issued by the Judge which the LECUPS makes
subject to some very strict requirements*™*:

- The public works have been declared to be in need of “urgent execution” by the
expropriating agency;**°

= The expropriating agency has filed the expropriation action and requests prior
occupation;***

- The Appraisal Commission appraises the expropriated property;*°”

- The expropriating agency deposits the amount established as the fair price
compensation;*** and

> The owner and occupants are notified of the prior occupation.°”
(ii) The action of the INDEPABIS

The Expropriation Decree was fully conscious of the property occupation system set forth in the
LECUPS, and the legal requirement that such occupation be carried out under the supervision of
the Courts. In fact: Art. 4 of the Expropriation Decree requires the occupation of the Plants to be
carried out in accordance with Art. 56 of the LECUPS:

“The reinforcement work is classified as being in need of urgent execution ... for the
purpose of the prior occupation of the property indicated in article 1 of this decree, in
accordance with the provisions set forth in article 56 of the Expropriation Law ...”

509, Art. 5 of the Decree adds:

“In accordance with the provisions set forth in the LECUPS, proceed to carry out the
actions ... for the acquisitions of the property mentioned, necessary for the execution of
the Rei work ... the ion of which is classified as urgent.”

 

510. Nevertheless, as it actually happened, the Bolivarian Republic did not follow the legal procedure
set forth in the LECUPS and ordered in the Expropriation Decree itself, instead seeking a
different procedure to occupy the property by means simple administrative acts, without legal
intervention. To this end, it made use of a special Law, the INDEPABIS Law, the purpose of
which is to guarantee to citizens access to goods and services, and of a public agency responsible
for its application, the INDEPABIS.

511. Immediately after issuing the Expropriation Decree, on 27 October 2010, the Bolivarian Republic
instructed the INDEPABIS to make an appearance in the expropriated companies and take
possession ipso jure of the Plants, creating Temporary Management Boards (“TMB”) for each of
them in Favianca and in OldV for their management.*® To do this, the INDEPABIS utilized the
inspection authority granted to it by the Law and the possibility of adopting preventive measures
in the event the companies are not complying with the obligations set forth by the aforementioned
regulation. The measures adopted by the INDEPABIS were formalized in three brief certificates
issued based on the following articles of the INDEPABIS Law:

- In Favianca, on the basis of arts. 111.1 and 111.12;°° these regulations define as an
unlawful act that “production chain members” restrict the supply of goods or that a risk

exists of “d i or ion of goods or d ts

concealing information, and 111.12 the risk of “destruction, disappearance or alteration
of goods or documents.”

(iii) Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant in that INDEPABIS engaged in arbitrary conduct that
constitutes an abuse of power, as there is a contradiction between the reasons invoked by
INDEPABIS for ordering the occupation and the real purpose behind them.

INDEPABIS ordered the temporary occupation of the Plants by means of an administrative
decision issued ex parte and having immediate effect. The reason cited by this agency to adopt a
measure so drastic and invasive of the fundamental rights of the party affected by the
expropriation was that the Companies were allegedly committing certain unlawful acts prohibited
by the INDEPABIS Law: according to the Records of the proceedings,

— The Companies were allegedly restricting the supply of goods;

— There was an alleged risk of i i or ‘ion of goods or d

— OldV was allegedly refusing to exhibit books or documents or concealing information.

Respondent has failed to provide any evidence in support of these allegations. Even INDEPABIS.
lacked any evidence whatsoever: before the temporary occupation could be ordered a prior
penalty procedure had to be initiated, and this was never carried out by INDEPABIS.
Respondent’s expert himself stated he was unaware of the existence of the penalty procedure.**
Since there is no case file that shows, even if just circumstantially, that the unlawful acts were
real, there is no legal basis to justify the ordering of the occupation. Also very significant is the
fact that, despite the elapsed time, after adopting such a draconian provisional order, INDEPABIS
never came to penalize the Companies for the unlawful acts that were under investigation.

Respondent’s allegation that INDEPABIS decided to carry out the occupation pursuant to Article
112 based on the exi of an objective risk of di: ling or stoppage of production®® lacks
any factual basis. There are no signs whatsoever that at any time Claimant considered the
possibility of resisting the expropriation by stopping production in its factories.

 

In reality, the purpose behind the Bolivarian Republic’s decision to use INDEPABIS temporarily
occupy the Plants was to avoid the cumbersome procedure established in the LECUPS which
requires litigating the case in administrative courts and securing a court order. It is important to
remember that pursuant to Article 56 of the LECUPS, expropriated assets may only be

occupied once their value has been assessed by a valuation commission and the fair price has
been deposited. These highly pi qui were cil by means of the interim
order entered by INDEPABIS.

 

This is recognized by Respondent's expert himself:

“To apply the prior occupation procedure... it was necessary to wait until the petition
for expropriation was made by means of a proper lawsuit... have the expert appraisal
performed and deposit the amount concerned. In other words, I think that the de facto
application based on Article 6 [of the INDEPABIS Law]*® was the result of
urgency...”°67

Venezuela decided not to conduct the occupation of the Plants pursuant to Article 56 of the
LECUPS because—as its expert recognizes—the protective procedure therein prescribed would
have required time and the deposit of the fair price. Respondent resorted to the temporary
occupation measure established in the INDEPABIS Law to take over the Plants for the purpose of
depriving Claimant of its rights under the LECUPS rather than as a temporary measure resulting
from the existence of alleged violations of the INDEPABIS Law by the Companies.

As an example of the arbitrary decisions, Schreuer includes “[text in English].”* In the opinion
of this Tribunal, the decision by INDEPABIS to carry out the occupation of the Plants falls neatly
within this category and constitutes a violation of the FET guarantee set forth in the BIT.

The decision of the Administrative Court

The Claimant alleges that the advance provisional remedy issued by the First Administrative
Court on 20 December 2010, in which it authorized the occupation, possession and use of the
property owned by the Companies implied an abuse of power and a violation of its right to due

process and good faith, due to:

= not having been notified of the proceeding or the decision in accordance with the law;°°*
and

- having been issued inaudita parte in violation of Venezuelan law”

The Respondent denies that the inaudita parte order authorizing the occupation of the Plants was
issued in violation of Venezuelan legislation,” since Venezuelan case law permits the issue of

5° Venezuela’s expert considers that the reference to Article 112 contained on the Records of the proceedings must
have been a mistake and that the occupation was actually carried out pursuant to Article 6 of the INDEPABIS Law.
The conclusion is the same regardless of which article is the right one.

provisional remedies in expropriation proceedings, it being, furthermore, the measure required by
the Respondent ex abundante cautela.*” In any event, because it was not challenged by the
Claimant in the Venezuelan courts it cannot be held that an unfair proceeding took place.”

Although the Parties do not expressly so state, the international standard to assess whether a legal
decision is in accordance with the FET guarantee is the denial of justice. Therefore, the Tribunal,
in the first place, will analyze the regulations and requirements for the denial of justice (a), will
then establish the proven facts (b), and subsequently verify whether the requisite elements are
present to declare that Venezuela committed a denial of justice (c).

a Regulations and requirements for denial of justice

Denial of justice constitutes a violation of the FET guaranteed in the BIT. Tribunals and doctrine
have unanimously held that the FET guarantee contained in investment protection treaties include
as an element the denial of justice.°”*

That the facts which occurred have the requisite requirements to be able to be considered an
international unlawful act of denial of justice is a different question. For this to occur it is
common practice for the party alleging the unlawful act to prove two requirements:

= (i) The legal system of the host State must have applied to the foreign investor treatment
clearly and obviously contrary to the legal system or due process;

- (ii) The foreign national in turn must have exhausted all existing domestic legal remedies
to combat the legal decision in question, or must prove that the filing of such appeals
would be clearly futile.*”*

(i) The national courts must administer justice in accordance with generally accepted standards at
the international level. They deviate from those standards if they refuse to admit or process
without undue delay a claim by a foreign national, or if they issue a judgment following a
proceeding which is severely flawed or the contents of which is manifestly inadmissible and
unlawful. In these cases we are faced with a denial of justice.°”*

(ii) The denial of justice presupposes a second requirement: the investor must have exhausted all
domestic remedies against the unlawful decision of the national legal system. As the arbitrator
stated in Pantechniki:

“Denial of justice does not arise until a reasonable opportunity to correct aberrant
judicial conduct has been given to the system as a whole”

However, this general rule has a significant qualification: in the application of international Law,
governing international claims, the appellant is not ot d to exhaust the di ti

when it is denied access to justice, when unreasonable delays existed in reaching the decision or
when subsequent remedies promise to be futile, due to the existence of reasonable doubt as to

their existence or their possibility of success.

  

b. Proven facts
The following constitute proven facts:

- Despite the fact that since the end of October, 2010, the Bolivarian Republic had already
taken possession of the Plants through the administrative measures adopted by the
INDEPABIS, on 18 November 2010 the PGR decided to validate the occupation legally,
and filed a petition for an advance provisional remedy of occupation of the Plants with
the First Administrative Court. It should be noted that this measure was not a prior
occupation petition under the terms of article 56 of the LECUPS, but was requested as an

proceeding” . The Claimant has decided not to participate in that proceeding.

c. Tribunal’s Analysis

In the decision dated 20 December 2010, the First Administrative Court issued an ex-parte
unnamed provisional remedy order, under which:

- the assets of OldV, Favianca and two other companies which were not mentioned in the
Expropriation Decree were to be occupied; and

- an ad hoc management board was to be formed.

The effect of that decision is substantially identical to that of the previous occupation provided
for in Article 56 of the LECUPS, even if it was not issued pursuant to that provision and was
called an unnamed provisional remedy order. The Court justified that decision under different
legal provisions,**' based on the urge to carry out the Glass Strengthening Project, and stated that
it was a reversible order. The unnamed provisional remedy order differs from the previous
occupation under the LECUPS in that it was agreed without appraising the assets and without a
bond or guarantee for the fair price—in other words, the judgment was issued disregarding the
guarantees set forth in Article 56 of the LECUPS.

The Second Administrative Court sub th idated this d provisi remedy
order into the expropriation proceedings and, as was explained by Claimant’s expert, the
provisional remedy order became an instrumental occupation order within the expropriation
proceedings. ***

The manner in which the order was issued and its content in disregard of the LECUPS raise
serious questions as to its legality. Nevertheless, this Tribunal will now analyze the requirements
for the existence of denial of justice in the reverse order: it will first examine whether domestic

dies were and only if it is luded that said requii is met will it evaluate
whether the Venezuelan Judiciary acted with clear and manifest unlawfulness.

Exhaustion of domestic remedies

This Tribunal has already reached the conclusion that it is a commonly accepted requirement for
the existence of denial of justice that the wronged party has exhausted or demonstrated the futility
of pursuing domestic remedies.

Ol European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

In the case at hand, it is a proven fact that Claimant has not appealed the provisional remedy
order and it has voluntarily decided not to participate in the expropriation proceedings—to the
point where Claimant only appeared before the Court to state that it would not participate. It is
also a fact that Claimant has produced no evidence whatsoever to demonstrate the futility of
defending itself before Venezuelan Courts.

The requirement to exhaust domestic remedies (or produce proof that the investor is being denied
access to domestic justice or that domestic justice has incurred unreasonable delays or that any
further motions would most likely be futile) is a requirement for an international tribunal to
decide that a court decision has denied justice. International Law cannot become a convenient
system to appeal any domestic court decision the investor disagrees with. Before it can be
established under International Law that a State’s legal system has committed a wrong, it is
essential to provide it with a chance to correct its own mistake. This conclusion, by the way, does
not exclude (according to Professor Orrego Vicufia) the fact that in cases of evident abuse by the
courts, international claims can be made without further conditions.

In the circumstances of the case at bar, where Claimant voluntarily chose not to appeal the
contested court decision and not to participate in the proceedings before Venezuelan courts, its
request that this Tribunal declare that the unnamed provisional remedy order amounted to a
violation of the FET standard cannot be admitted.

Coercion of personnel

Claimant argues that Respondent violated the FET standard by coercing, threatening and
harassing the employees of the companies from the moment of the expropriation.** In particular,
OIEG alleges that the threats to prosecute the employees for “sabotage” in a context of military
occupation™®*:

- Instilled fear and coerced employees to stay in their job positions and operate the Plants for
the benefit of Respondent;*”

- Constitute a violation of due process because Respondent never clarified what was meant
by “sabotage” nor did it indicate what legal provision defined it as a crime*** and

- Demonstrate the lack of good faith®® and transparency of the Republic.°”

Luis Gémez at MINCIT offices in order to hold introductory talks after the announcement
of the measure.

- During these exchanges, the Minister stated that “any measure taken with the intent to
paralyze the operations of the Plants would be considered an act of sabotage.”

- That same day, the General of the GNB, Orlando Rodriguez, held a meeting with workers
at the Los Guayos plant. Since the meeting was not successful, the General organized a
meeting that same afternoon at the regional headquarters of the National Guard.

The Tribunal’s Decision

542. Claimant alleges that the Bolivarian Republic coerced the Plant workers by threatening to
prosecute them for “sabotage” if they refused to collaborate with the new management installed
following the expropriation. The Republic admits that it used the term “sabotage,” but it denies
that its conduct was coercive or intimidating.

543. Claimant also alleges that there were similar warnings made during the meeting held with
Orlando Rodriguez, General of the GNB [Bolivarian National Guard],“° and later, by the
members of the JAT.° It also claims that the GNB’s presence at the Plants exacerbated the
intimidation.“*

544. The Tribunal dismisses OIEG’s claim in light of the fact that it failed to sufficiently prove the
events it has alleged.

545. | What the record does prove, however, is that the Minister of MINCIT, during the meeting that
took place on 27 October 2010, advised the workers not to engage in “sabotage,” as any
deliberate action taken to stop the Plants from operating would be punished.” Apart from the
warnings given by Minister Menéndez, Claimant has not proven the alleged threats by General
Orlando Rodriguez or the members of the JAT.* The Minister’s warning was never

consummated and no criminal proceedings for sabotage were ever brought against any employee.
What is more: most of the workers continued to work for Venvidirio once the transition period
came to an end.’

Claimant submits that the Minister of MINCIT’s statements amount to an international offense
because they are a FET violation attributable to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The
Tribunal has already concluded that a State only breaches the FET guarantee when it takes action
that is manifestly contrary to the legal system or disregards the basic tenets of the rule of law."
The Minister’s statements do not amount to a violation of this standard: warning of the
consequences of a crime or an unlawful act cannot be interpreted as a threat or coercion.

Finally, in paragraphs 579 er seg., the Tribunal will examine the presence of the GNB at the
Plants (and will conclude that it was not serious enough to constitute an international offense
attributable to the Republic).

In summary, the warnings made by Minister Menéndez that any deliberate action taken to stop
the Plants from operating would be punished did not constitute threats that would give rise to an
international offense. Furthermore, it has not been proven that the workers were coerced to
continue working at the Plants. Therefore, no violation of the FET standard for this claim has
taken place.

The occupation period of the plants

Claimant alleges that the occupation period of the Plants was characterized by:
- Violations of due process,"

- Lack of transparency®” and

- Lack of good faith.*"

period and asserts that Claimant has collected a series of trivial events and characterized them as
international offences.°'® The Republic defends itself from Claimant’s arguments by stating that:

= It is not proven that INDEPABIS and aNESASED engaged in abuse of authority or acted
with intent to cause damage to Claimant.°"

- In November 2010, the employer of the workers of the Plants was OldV, and therefore only
OldV could participate in the collective bargaining negotiations.”°

- Deadlines for the completion of the transition period were not modified, and in any case
that could not be construed as worsening the circumstances or coercion.” The policy of the
Republic during the transition period was “laissez-faire.”°

- Two days after the issuance of the Expropriation Decree, INDEPABIS arrived at the Plants,
took possession of them, appointed a board of directors and began an audit.

- During November and December 2010, Respondent dispatched its agency for labor health

investigation and ordered certain health and safety improvements.“ In August 2011
INPSASEL proposed imposing a penalty on OldV, which filed exculpatory pleadings. In
February 2012, INPSASEL imposed a fine of VEB 10,988,550 (approximately
USD 2,555,476.74 at the official exchange rate at that time®*) on OldV for breaching labor
health and safety regulations.°*

- In November 2010, the Ministry of Labor of the Republic required that OldV management
participate in the collective bargaining negotiations with the members of the workers’

union.”

- MINCIT authorized third-party visits to the Plants against the will of the Companies.*
Uruguayan company Envidrio and directors of Chinese company Sunrise Technology

visited the Plants.
- There were several extensions to the transition period.

The Tribunal’s Decision

554. Following the expropriation and takeover of the Plants, a transition period began and lasted for
six months. During that period the Plants continued to operate normally under the supervision of
the government, which availed itself of this temporary period so that its trusted officials could
acquire the know-how needed to manage a glass container production company.

Award

submits that Claimant compounded all the trivial things that occurred during the transition period
and has characterized them as international offenses.

On this point, the Tribunal shares the Republic’s view and dismisses OIEG’s claim.

Aside from the conduct by INDEPABIS that did amount to a violation of due process (and that
was previously addressed in paras. 502, ef seg. supra), the Tribunal finds no evidence that would
warrant raising the conduct complained of by Claimant to the classification of an international
offense. During the transition period Claimant had to endure situations that could be characterized
as unpleasant, and that are inherent to any forced takeover procedure. Nevertheless, Claimant has
failed to prove how these situations amount to offenses that would incur liability under the BIT.
Specifically, Claimant has not proven that INPSASEL’s “re-investigation” gave rise to an FET
violation—especially considering that the entity ended up finding violations of legal provisions.

In terms of visits by third parties to the Plants and the transfer of intellectual property to Chinese
companies, it has also not been proven that this constitutes a FET violation, and the Tribunal
refers to the conclusions reached in paragraph 897 infra with respect to damages.

In conclusion, with the exception of the conduct on the part of INDEPABIS, which was arbitrary
and amounted to an abuse of authority in violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT, it has not been
proven that the Republic’s other conduct during the transition period constituted a violation of the
FET standard under the Treaty.

In summary: the Tribunal agrees with the claims Claimant has presented, and finds that the
Bolivarian Republic subjected Claimant’s investments to unfair or inequitable treatment and to
arbitrary measures in violation of Article 3(1) of the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT because the
expropriation violated due process and the takeover of the Plants by INDEPABIS was arbitrary.

BREACH OF ART. (3)2 OF THE BIT: FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY
Claimant’s position

Claimant alleges that Respondent did not ensure the full protection and security (FPS) of OIEG’s
investments, which would constitute a violation of Art. 3(2) of the BIT.

Award

562. According to Claimant, legal scholars“ and decisions of international tribunals“ confirm that

the contemporary understanding of the FPS guarantee goes beyond physical protection to include
the violation of the rights of investors by operation of the laws of the host State. Claimant defends
the extension of the FPS standard to legal protection based on the following arguments:

- Definition of investment in Art. 1(a) of the BIT includes intangible assets, which only
enjoy full protection and security through legal:**°

- There is no overlap between the FET and FPS standards, because the latter involves the
positive obligations of care and due diligence.*”

563. Claimant maintains that Venezuela did not comply with its duty to guarantee the physical
protection of Claimant's investments or with its duty to ensure their legal protection.*

564. — First, Claimant considers that the deployment of the GNB at the Plants caused an atmosphere in
which the employees of the Plants were threatened and intimidated®” and had no other alternative
than to obey the orders of Respondent or face legal action for “sabotage.”“? That constitutes,
according to Claimant, a breach of the duty to protect the physical safety of its investments.

565. Second. Claimant alleges that by expropriating its investments without taking into account
Venezuelan legislation and incurring obvious violations of the Investment Law and LECUPS,
Respondent removed the legal protection granted to those investments.“ Likewise, the
Investment Law contained important protections that were breached by the Republic when it
expropriated the investment.

protection to which OIEG] was entitled pursuant to art. 3(2) of the BIT.“?

B. Respondent's Position

567. Respondent denies having violated Art. 3(2) of the BIT by failing to comply with the FPS
standard.

568. First, the Republic argues that the FPS standard is traditionally linked to physical protection and
imposes on the State a duty of care and diligence, and not an objective responsibility.“
Venezuela does not deny that some courts have extended the protection of the FPS clause.
However, it maintains that this view is not the predominant one, since a broad interpretation of
the FPS clause would overlap with the FET standard.™* It further argues that the cases cited by
Claimant are not applicable, because in all of them there was a modification of the regulatory
framework or frustration of legitimate expectations—which did not happen in this case—and the
Tribunal’s decision was closely linked to the violation of the FET standard.”

569. Second, Respondent denies that it has caused any physical coercion of employees of the
Companies to continue operating the Plants.“* In fact, it claims that the majority decided to
continue working for Venvidrio.“? Venezuela maintains that the intervention at the Plants was
peaceful and believes that Claimant has exaggerated the presence of the GNB, which for most of
the time was present in very small groups (two or three guards),°*° positioned at security booths
of the Plants, without interfering with the entry and exit, and only entered the Plants to go to the
cafeteria.°' According to Respondent, the mission of the GNB was to maintain peace at the
facilities.°

570. Third, Respondent rejects Claimant’s argument that by expropriating OIEG investments,
Venezuela violated the Investment Law and LECUPS and, therefore, violated the provisions of
their own legislation. Respondent holds that Venezuelan law allows and extensively regulates
compulsory acquisition and concludes that Venezuela ordered the compulsory acquisition of the
Companies in accordance with LECUPS, and that in no way did it deprive Claimant’s
investments of legal protection. Therefore, it cannot be held that Venezuela violated art. 3 (2) of
the BIT.

The Analysis of the Tribunal

The obligation to accord FPP [Full Physical Protection] to protected investments is recognized
under Article 3(2) of the BIT, which immediately follows Article 3(1) regulating the FET
guarantee. It reads as follows:

. Each contracting party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the
investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by
arbitrary or discrimi the
use, enjoyment or Sispoaal thereof by those national.

2. More particularly, each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments full
physical security and protection which in any case shall not be less than that
accorded either to investments of its own nationals or to the investments of
national of any third State, whichever is more favorable to the national
concerned.”

The Parties disagree as to the scope and interpretation to be given to the FPP standard. The debate
Centers on determining the breadth of the protection. Claimant alleges that the standard includes
not just the physical security of the investment, but legal certainty as well.°** Claimant argues that
the definition of investment in Art. 1(a) of the BIT includes intangible assets, which can only
enjoy full security and protection through legal protection.** It also insists that there would be no
overlap between the FET and FPP standards because this entails the positive obligations of
vigilance and due diligence.°**

Respondent denies that the protection extends to legal certainty: the FPP standard is, it claims,
traditionally linked to physical protection and would impose on the State a duty of vigilance and

diligence, but not of strict liability. Venezuela does not deny that some tribunals have favored
an extensive interpretation, but maintains that this is not the predominant view” and that the

cases cited by Claimant are not applicable.°**
The Tribunal agrees with Respondent.

It has been widely argued whether the primary scope of protection of the FPP standard, which
only covers physical security, can also be extended to legal certainty. If such extension were
accepted,*° any arbitrary modifications to the legal and regulatory framework could also give rise
to violations of the FPP standard.

‘Award

In the case before us, the matter is resolved by the language of Article 3(2) itself.

- First, the precept is similar to a specific application of the FET standard, given that it is
immediately inserted after the FET guarantee (contained in Article 3(1)) and leads with
the phrase “more particularly.” As such, a literal reading of the BIT indicates that there is
a general classification—FET under Article 3(1}—and a more specific type—FPP under
Article 3(2). Whereas the general classification covers acts that violate legal certainty, the
specific type Centers on physical security.

= The language itself in Article 3(2) of the BIT confirms this interpretation: it expressly
uses the adjective “physical” to describe the security it guarantees. A literal
interpretation, favored by Article 31(1) of the CVDT, unavoidably leads to the conclusion
that Article 3(2) of the Treaty is limited to guaranteeing full physical security and
protection.

In summary, Article 3(2) of the BIT deals with a specific type within the general classification of
FET that applies when the security of an investment is impaired by physical violence or civil
strife.“ The responsibility of the State will arise if it fails to adopt the protection measures that
would be required out of prudence to protect the foreign property covered under the Treaty.

Application of the Standard to the Facts

Claimant alleges that the presence of the GNB beginning on the morning of 26 October 2010—
prior to the issuance of the Expropriation Decree—and its continued presence at the Plants over
several weeks entailed a violation of the FPP standard.®! The Republic, in contrast, insists that
the intervention of the GNB was carried out without any harassment or threats™ and was only
aimed at keeping the peace in the Plants in light of protests by the workers.

The Tribunal agrees with Respondent’s view and dismisses OIKG’s claim in this respect.

The FPP guarantee entails an obligation by the State to deploy its police force or take other
coercive measures to prevent others from disrupting the peaceful possession and enjoyment of the
investment. The mere presence of the GNB during the takeover of the Companies is a component
of the precautionary measures a government authority legitimately can and should take to ensure
that control is assumed in an orderly manner, precisely for the purpose of guaranteeing FPP of the
investment. It is contradictory to allege that the actions of the State’s security forces, which
ensure physical security, constitute a violation of the FPP standard.

In summary: the Tribunal dismisses the claims put forward by Claimant requesting that the
Tribunal find that the Bolivarian Republic violated Article 3(2) of the Netherlands-Venezuela
BIT.

BREACH OF ART. 3(4) OF THE BIT: UMBRELLA CLAUSE

Claimant’s Position

Claimant argues that Venezuela violated the provisions of art. 3(4) of the BIT [the “Umbrella

Clause”], which requires that Respondent comply with “any obligations” that could have been
assumed ding the of i b ing to Dutch national:

 

Claimant maintains that international courts, in interpreting umbrella clauses that are similar to
that of this BIT, have highlighted the broad scope of phrases such as “any obligations.”

Complainant believes that Respondent assumed certain obligations with respect to Claimant’s
investments under Articles 6, 8, 11, 12, and 15 of the Investment Law, which provide
respectively:

* The right of investments to receive fair and equitable treatment;

- The prohibition of discriminatory treatment of investments and investors due to the country
of origin of capital;

> The prohibition of illegal expropriation under international law;

- The right of international investors and investments to transfer all payments related to
investments;

: Venezuela’s i to develop for ii and investors.

Claimant rejects the restrictive interpretation given by Respondent of the terms of art. 3(4) of the
BIT and, in particular, the argument that the Umbrella Clause does not require recipient States to
respect obligations assumed in investments in general—as set forth in the Investment Law—but
only for specific investments.“ Claimant relies on decisions such as SGS®” and Enron®* to

claim that the broad terms in which the Umbrella Clause of the BIT was written force Venezuela
to respect the legal obligations under its domestic law, such as the Investment Law.*?

In short, Claimant believes that it is proven that Venezuela did not comply with the obligations
arising from the Investment Law, and therefore breached art. 3(4) of the BIT.°”

Respondent’s Position

Respondent rejects the claim, arguing that the Investment Law, on which Claimant bases its
claim, does not refer to specific investments, rather it involves a general rule that establishes a
generic regulatory framework for investments in Venezuela. It further argues that the Investment
Law does not refer to a specific sector but confirms commitments similar to those already
provided for in the BIT and international Law, whereby the cases on which Claimant relies are
not applicable. Therefore, Respondent argues that it is inconceivable that the alleged violation of
the Investment Law gives rise to a breach of the Umbrella Clause of the BIT.°”

The Analysis of the Tribunal
Art. 3(4) of the BIT includes a Clause of Incorporation of other obligations:

“Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into
with regard to the treatment of investments of nationals of the other Contracting
Party.”

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the Clause of Incorporation is broadly worded. As
previous tribunals have reflected,” the term “any obligation” includes obligations entered into by
law. Consequently, Venezuela has accepted the commitment to fulfil all of the legal obligations
established in the Venezuelan legal system.

The Venezuelan legal system includes the Investment Law.*” The purpose of this law is to
provide a stable, predictable legal framework for national and foreign investments:

“Article 1. The purpose of this Decree-Law is to provide investors and investments,
both national and foreign, with a stable and predictable legal framework in which
same can be carried out in an atmosphere of security, through the regulation of State
intervention with regard to those investments and investors, with a view to

increasing, diversifying, and harmoniously complementing the investments in order
to promote national development objectives.”

The Investment Law also includes certain precepts that are very similar to the guarantees granted
to the investments protected under the BIT:

“Article 6. International investments shall have the right to fair and equitable

treatment in accordance with the regulations and criteria of international law and

shall not be subject to arbitrary or discriminatory measures that hinder the
i use, enj s ion, sale, or liquidation thereof.

 

Article 8. The treatment of international investments or investors shall not
discriminate based on the country where their capital originates. (...)

Article 11. (...) Investments shall only be expropriated (...) for reasons of public
utility or social interest, following the procedure that has been legally established for
such purposes, in a non-discriminatory way and with prompt, just, and adequate
compensation.

The compensation shall be equivalent to the fair price of the expropriated investment
immediately before the time at which the expropriation is announced by the legal
mechanisms or made public, whichever occurs first. The compensation, which will
include the payment of interest until the effective payment date, calculated on the
basis of customary business standards, shall be paid without delay.

Sole Paragraph: The compensations that are applicable as a result of the
expropriations of international investments shall be paid in convertible currency and
shall be freely transferable out of the country.

Article 12. International investments and, as the case may be, international investors,
shall have the right, upon prior compliance with domestic regulations and the
payment of the applicable taxes, to the transfer of all payments associated with the
investments, such as the initial capital ...; the profits, ... and the payments that result
from the settlement of disputes. (...)”

The Venezuelan Investment Law thus offers all investors a protection against expropriation and
unfair and unequal treatment analogous to the protection afforded by the BIT to the protected
Dutch investors. In turn, article 3(4) of the BIT elevates the failure to comply with “any
obligation that [Venezuela] may have entered into with regard to the treatment of [protected]
investments” to the category of a breach of the Treaty. Therefore, non-compliance with the
Venezuelan Investment Law effectively becomes non-compliance with the BIT as well.

The practical consequences of this conclusion are few: the Tribunal has already established the
conclusion that Venezuela’s actions entailed a failure to comply with the obligations on
expropriation and fair and equitable treatment contained in the BIT, with the consequence that the
Claimant has the right to receive compensation in accordance with the provisions thereof.

The Claimant has not argued that the protection offered by the Venezuelan Investment Law is
greater or more extensive than that granted by the BIT. Therefore, the Claimant’s substantive
rights, as a consequence of the international offenses committed by the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela, shall be those that proceed from the BIT, and the invocation of the Investment Law
shall not provide grounds for greater protection.

In summary, the Tribunal considers the claim made by the Claimant, requesting that the Tribunal
declare that Venezuela violated the Clause of Incorporation of article 3(4) of the Netherlands-
Venezuela BIT, to have merit, even though the consequences thereof do not differ from the ones
that were previously identified by the Tribunal.

BREACH OF ART. 5 OF THE BIT: TRANSFER OF PAYMENTS

Claimant’s position

The Claimant states that the Bolivarian Republic also breached Art. 5 of the BIT, which guarantees
that “payments related to an investment may be transferred ... in a freely convertible currency,
without restriction or undue delay.

1674

OIEG accuses the Bolivarian Republic of having breached this guarantee in two ways:

First, because the request to transfer funds between OldV/Favianca and OJEG experienced
unwarranted delays; the requests were submitted in May, November, and June 2009 and were
denied on 8 September 201 1—almost three and a half years later—by CADIVI, the body of the
Republic in charge of exchange control; furthermore, the decision was made just one week after
the presentation of this arbitration, and never ended up being communicated to the Venezuelan
Companies.°”*

Second, because CADIVI denied the transfer of the dividends declared by OldV on 21 May
2008 and 15 June 2009 and by Favianca on 24 November 2008 to their parent company;*”°
CADIVI’s decision was based on an inaccurate inference: that the dividends had allegedly
already been paid to OIEG; in reality, the dividends appeared in the balance of the Venezuelan
Companies as “accounts payable” because they had been forwarded to the group in the form of
a loan.

As compensation for the alleged breach of Art. 5 of the BIT, the Claimant claims a compensation of
over USD 54 million.

OI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

Respondent's Position

The Bolivarian Republic rejects the accusation that it breached Art. 5 of the BIT, based on legal and
factual arguments.

From the legal point of view, the Respondent emphasizes two limitations on the guarantee offered
by Art. 5:

— First, the provision does not grant a foreign investor an absolute right to repatriate its profits,
but rather convertibility is only guaranteed “without restriction or undue delay”; i.e., legitimate
and justified restrictions on convertibility are fully compatible with the BIT; and Venezuelan
exchange control regulations fall into this category."

— Second, Art. 5 of the BIT only guarantees the investor’s right to repatriate funds “into a freely
convertible currency”; nevertheless, the Treaty does not contain a guarantee that the
convertibility has to be done at the official exchange rate, and not at the market rate; other
BITs, on the contrary, would include this guarantee.°”

From the factual point of view, the Bolivarian Republic alleges that CADIVI’s rejection of the three
requests was fully justified.

CADIVI warmed that the dividends for which authorization was being requested had already been
paid and transferred abroad, and in the face of that circumstance, there would have been no
alternative but to deny the petitions. Such payment would be deducted on its face from the annual
accounts of OldV and Favianca®! and would have been confirmed by the expert of the Claimant
itself in the course of the Hearing.” Furthermore, it would not be true that CADIVI’s decision had
been made with knowledge of the filing of this arbitration,“ or that the administrative act had not
been communicated to the Venezuelan Companies—was merely made to the management of the
Plants, which was what was recorded in the case file.

The Analysis of the Tribunal

This dispute revolves around Art. 5 of the Bilateral Investment Treaty that guarantees the free
transfer of profits generated by a protected investment. Claimant alleges that CADIVI was

repatriate

dividends converted into foreign currency at the official exchange rate, and that they therefore
had to obtain the foreign currency through the parallel market, suffering the significant loss of
more than USD 54 million. The Bolivarian Republic rejects the claim, arguing that the BIT
guarantees transferability, but not the exchange rate, and that CA VIDI’s rejection was completely
justified.

To resolve this disagreement, the Tribunal will first establish the proven facts (a.), then analyze
the different interpretations of Art. 5 BIT (b), and conclude with a decision on the dispute (c).

a. Proven facts

The proven facts are the following:
(i) In early 2003, the Venezuelan government issued an Exchange Agreement®® establishing an
exchange control system. In addition, shortly thereafter, it created CA VIDI, a government agency
in charge of approving transactions in foreign currency. The Bolivarian Republic’s grounds for
establishing such measures were;

— The decrease in the supply of foreign currency coming from the oil industry and the
extraordinary demand for currency had negatively affected the level of international reserves
and the exchange rate, which could endanger the normal development of the country’s
economic activity;

— The decrease in domestic industry exports, significantly affecting the Nation’s accounts;

- The need to adopt measures aimed at achieving the stability of the currency, ensuring the
continuity of the country’s international payments and counteracting undesirable capital
flight.

Outside this exchange control system created by the government, there was always the possibility
of obtaining USD in Venezuela through the parallel foreign currency market. This market
consisted of buying Venezuelan government bonds or corporate bonds with VEB and then selling
them in USD. The exchange rate in this parallel market was determined by the play of free supply
and demand and was always less favorable than the official exchange rate.

(ii) On 21 May 2008 and 15 June 2009, OldV declared various dividends. Claimant’s 73.97%
stake in OldV entitled it to receive VEB 67,040,925 and VEB 77,538,119, respectively.

Ol European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

On 24 November 2009, Favianca also declared dividends. Claimant’s 32% stake in Favianca
entitled it to receive VEB 15,693,440.

All the dividends were declared in VEB, the official currency of the Bolivarian Republic. OIEG
was entitled to a total of VEB 160,272.487 (which, at the official exchange rate at that time—2.15
VEB/USD—would equal USD 74,545,342).

 

(iii) On 27 June 2008 and 6 August 2009, OldV applied to CADIVI for repatriation of the
dividends declared in favor of Claimant. On 23 October 2009, Favianca also submitted an
identical request for its dividends. The requests totaled the VEB 160,272,487 owed by the
Companies.

(iv) Between December 2009 and April 2010, the Companies used VEB 402.573.736 to buy and
subsequently sell bonds in the parallel market , which resulted in a balance of USD 59,544,000 at
an average exchange rate of 6.76 VEB per USD.’ The Companies transferred the USDs that
were obtained to OI.5*

 

It must be kept in mind that the dividends were always denominated in VEB and that the amount
to be repatriated only totaled VEB 160.272.487. However, the companies spent VEB 402.573.736
on buying USD to send them to their parent company.

 

 

(iv) In the meantime, the three requests submitted to CADIVI remained undecided. It was not
until 8 September 2011 that CADIVI decided to reject them and so notified the Companies,
sending the document to their original addresses, which coincided with the address of the
expropriated Plants. Claimant has stressed that CADIVI’s decision was issued one week after
Claimant filed the Request for Arbitration. However, as Respondent has pointed out, the fact that
the dates match is a mere coincidence. The ICSID only registered the Arbitration Request on 26
September 2011, i.e. three weeks after CADIVI’s decision, and prior to that date, the Republic
could not have known its exact terms.

b. The correct interpretation of Art. 5 of the BIT

The text of Art. 5 BIT establishes:
“The Contracting Parties shall guarantee that the payments related to any investment
may be transferred. Such transfers shall be made in a freely convertible currency,

with no restriction or undue delay. Such transfers shall include, but not be limited to:

a) Profits, interest, dividends and other current income;

ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

The parties are debating the proper interpretation of this provision.

Claimant believes that Art. 5 requires the Bolivarian Republic to implement a system of free

for the profits d by p d ii The creation of an exchange
control system with the subsequent need for CADIVI authorization would represent a de jure
violation of the accorded guarantee.”

 

On the other hand, Respondent asserts that legitimate and justified restrictions to free
convertibility are fully compatible with the BIT, because it does not grant the foreign investor an
absolute right to repatriate its profits. Rather, it only guarantees free convertibility “without
restriction or undue delay.” The V hi, control lati and parti ly the
requirements for CADIVI authorization, would thus be fully compatible with the Treaty. In
eddition; the Treaty does not guarantee that conversion has to be done at the official exchange
rate.

The Tribunal’s Decision

The parties debate whether the exchange control system instituted in Venezuela starting in 2003
complies with the guarantees on free transfer and convertibility of profits offered by the BIT to
protected investors. On this matter, the Tribunal leans toward the position defended by the
Bolivarian Republic.

In 2003, Venezuela decided to institute a dual control system that, when the events under analysis
occurred,” would allow any foreign investor in Venezuela that needed foreign currency to resort
to either an official market or a parallel market to obtain it.

The official market offered a more favorable exchange rate set by the State, while in the parallel
market, which worked through the purchase and subsequent sale of public debt or bonds, the
exchange rate was freely established by the market, and in practice was worse for the investor
than the official market (because the investor needed a greater quantity of VEB to buy the same
amount of USD). Access to the official system required a request to CADIVI, the agency that the
Republic had put in charge of managing the exchange control system and that enjoyed broad
discretion in granting or denying the authorization, depending on the availability of foreign
currencies and for reasons of economic policy.

Thus, we see that in the specific case of repatriation of dividends under Art. 121 of Currency
Exchange Order No. 56 dated 18 August, 2004:

°° Cl, paragraph 50.
© RIL, paragraph 424,

The currency exchange system in Venezuela has undergone different modifications that will not be analyzed by
this Tribunal. The Tribunal limits itself to analyzing the currency exchange system at the time that the events in
question occurred.

“Article 11. The authorizations to purchase foreign currencies (autorizaciones de
adquisicién de divisas - AAD) referring to international investments ... shall be
subject to the availability of foreign currencies established by the Central Bank of
Venezuela and the guidelines issued by the National Executive Branch.”

Does Art. 5 of the BIT offer investors an absolute guarantee that they would be able to repatriate
their profits at all times, and applying the official market exchange rate? The answer has to be

no.

(i) This can be seen, first, from the very wording of the article, because it only guarantees the
conversion and transfer of funds “with no restriction or undue delay.” On the on other hand, it
allows the State to create restrictions or delays for justified cause. The introduction of exchange
control systems is part of the economic and financial sovereignty of the States, and does not
constitute an “undue restriction” for purposes of the BIT. Having created an exchange control
system, the State may legitimately opt for a single structure or prefer, as Venezuela has done, a
dual system with an official market and another parallel market. The choice of one or the other
alternative is a policy decision, outside the scope of an arbitral tribunal’s review.

(ii) Second, it should be stressed that the BIT only protects the transfer of profits denominated in
a “freely convertible currency.” Note that the Treaty does not establish any guarantee whatsoever
on the applicable exchange rate. In this, it differs significantly from other BITs that do regulate
this issue. Thus, the Venezuela — France BIT refers to the normal rate of exchange officially in
force on the date of the transfer;"®* or the United Kingdom — Venezuela BIT to the “rate of
exchange applicable on the date of transfer pursuant to the exchange regulations in force.”***

Since there is no reference whatsoever to a guaranteed exchange rate in the BIT between
Venezuela and the Netherlands, then provided the exchange control system instituted by the
Republic allows free transferability, even if it is at the parallel market exchange rate and not at the
official market exchange rate, the accorded guarantee cannot be taken to have been violated. This
is precisely what happened: Venezuela instituted a dual system in which the foreign investor
could freely opt between repatriating its profits through CADIVI or opt for the parallel market. In
the first case, it enjoyed a privileged exchange rate, but the authorization was subject to the
availability of foreign currencies and to general policy decisions. In the second case, the exchange
rate was the market rate, but the conversion was immediate and did not require an administrative
authorization.

In summary, the Tribunal thus reaches that conclusion that the exchange control system instituted

by Venezuela at the time that the events in question occurred was compatible with the guarantees
accorded by Art. 5 of the BIT to guaranteed investors, despite the fact that the exchange rate

that was used resulted in losses for Claimant when the conversion was done.

c. Application of the law to the facts

Pro memoria: Between June 2008 and October 2009, OldV and Favianca applied to CADIVI for
authorization to repatriate dividends in the amount of over VEB 160 million. In view of the lack
of administrative authorization, the Companies used VEB 402 million to buy foreign currencies
in the parallel market and repatriated them for the benefit of the OI group. In September 2011,
CADIVI rejected the three dividend repatriation requests, arguing that they had already been
paid.

Claimant believes that Venezuela committed a double violation of Art. 5: CADIVI was guilty of
excessive delay and ultimately rejected the request with no justification.

The Bolivarian Republic denies having violated Art. 5 of the BIT. It emphasizes that Claimant
admits that it transferred the dividends through the parallel market and therefore CADIVI’s
decision to deny the repatriation of dividends that had already been repatriated was justified. It
was the Companies who improperly handled the procedure with CADIVI, asking to expatriate
funds that had already been transferred to their parent company.

The Tribunal holds that Respondents’ defense is pertinent.

Having declared the dividend in favor of OIEG, the Companies had the option of resorting to the
official market or the parallel market to convert the VEB to USD. Initially, they attempted to
access the official market because they exchange rate was better, although there were
uncertainties concerning the administrative authorization. A few months after submitting the third
request to CADIVI, and without waiting for the government agency to act, the Companies freely
decided to abandon the official market route, opting for the alternative and buying the foreign
currency in the parallel market, and in this process, they not only spent the amount of the
dividends owed (VEB 160,272,487), but a significantly higher figure (VEB 402,573,736).

By opting for the parallel market, the companies tacitly waived the option of obtaining the foreign
currency through CADIVI. Once the dividends are converted into USD through the parallel
market and the funds repatriated to the parent company through this procedure, it is inappropriate
for Claimant to complain that the exchange rate was unfavorable and that CADIVI’s decision was
overdue and denied the request. The Companies themselves were the ones who opted for the
paralle] market.

Award

Claimant has attempted to justify its behavior by arguing that buying the USD in the parallel
market was not due to the repatriation of dividends, but in reality was a loan granted by the
Companies to another subsidiary of the group (OI Manufacturing Netherlands B.V.).” However,
the existence of the loan is not proven, and in any event the annual financial statements of OldV
and Favianca show that the dividends had already been paid.©*

Consequently, CADIVI’s decisions to reject the fund transfer requests because the dividends had
already been transferred through the parallel market were justified (although they were, in fact,
issued somewhat late, this is not serious enough to constitute an illicit act under international
law). Once an investor has opted to repatriate the funds through the parallel market, it loses its
right to claim the conversion into foreign currency through the official market controlled by
CADIVI.

Therefore, the Tribunal dismisses the claims set forth by Claimant, asking the Tribunal to declare
that the Bolivarian Republic violated Article 5 of the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT.

Once each of the party’s jurisdictional arguments and arguments on the merits have been examined
and it is confirmed that the Bolivarian Republic has breached the prohibition on expropriation and
the guarantee of FET—contained respectively in Art. 6 and Art. 3(1) of the BIT—it is necessary to
determine the appropriate compensation.

The parties have provided extensive expert testimony for calculating the damage. The Claimant has
used the expertise of Brent C. Kaczmarek, CFA, from the consulting firm Navigant Consulting. Mr.
Kaczmarek has submitted two reports [“Kaczmarek I” and “II”’]. For its part, the Respondent has
hired Jean-Luc Guitera, a partner at KPMG Forensic in France, who has also submitted two reports
[“Guitera I” and “II”]. Both experts appeared at the Hearing, gave a summary of their positions,
and were questioned by the other party and by the Tribunal.

Upon finishing their statements, and with the consent of both parties, the Tribunal asked both
experts to jointly prepare a matrix with calculations of the value of the Companies, applying
various parameters in the assessment of the DCF [the “Joint Matrix”).”° Both experts did so,
submitting the joint work dated 9 October 2013. The Tribunal thanks them for their effort.

The Claimant's position

The Claimant states that, in accordance with the principles established by International Law,
Venezuela is required to make restitution for all the damages that its unlawful conduct has caused
the Claimant. This full restitution standard would require not only the payment of the market value
of the Companies, but also the recovery of all the other damages caused.””!

The Claimant, specifically, claims a total of USD 929,544,714, divided into six types of damages:

= USD 729,821,323 for the expropriation of the Venezuelan Companies

— USD 16,833,383 for the expropriation of the surplus cash in the bank accounts of OldV and
Favianca

- USD 54,292,257 for the loss of revenue caused by Respondent’s unlawful interference with
the repatriation of the Claimant’s dividends paid by OldV and Favianca

- USD 50,566,759 for indirect damages caused by the use of property unlawfully expropriated to
cause harm to the Claimant’s business outside Venezuela

- USD 68,030,992 for indirect damages caused by the dissemination outside Venezuela, and as a
consequence of the expropriation of the Plants, of the intellectual property of OI and other
confidential information and processes

— USD 10,000,000 for moral damages caused by “egregious conduct” during the six months
following the expropriation.

In addition, the Claimant claims interest from the date of the expropriation, costs, and interest on
the costs.”

The Respondent’s position

For its part, the Respondent denies that the Claimant has any right to receive compensation.”
Secondarily, based on its expert’s calculations, it reaches conclusions diametrically opposed to
those of the Claimant:

— With regard to compensation for the expropriation of the Companies, while the Claimant is
asking for USD 729,821,323, the Respondent proposes USD 1 13,807,000.

— With regard to the surplus cash expropriated together with the expropriated Companies, the
figure of USD 16,833,383 proposed by the Claimant, should be reduced, in the Respondent’s
opinion, to USD 7,738,000."

With regard to the four remaining items claimed by the Claimant, the Respondent radically denies
any liability.

Rejection of compensation for non-transferability

Before conducting an in-depth analysis, the Tribunal can already dismiss a limine one of the
Claimant’s claims: the one that refers to the damages caused by the alleged breach of the guarantee
of transferability contained in Art. 5 of the BIT. The Tribunal has already reached the conclusion
that the Bolivarian Republic has not breached this provision;”® therefore, there are no grounds to
award compensation for this cause.

Structure of the decision
With regard to the remaining items claimed, the Tribunal will proceed in the following manner:
— First, it will analyze the legal basis for requesting compensation for expropriation (2.)

— Second, it will study what the appropriate methodology must be to establish the market value of
OIEG?’s interest in the expropriated Companies, and will apply this methodology to find out
that value (3.).

— Third, it will review whether the Claimant is entitled to claim compensation for additional
damages, which exceed the market value of the expropriated Companies and will analyses
whether there are grounds for the two sums requested by the Claimant—damages caused
abroad and inappropriate dissemination of intellectual property (4.).

— Fourth, it will dedicate a section to the request for compensation for moral damages (5.).
- Finally ending with a section dedicated to interest (6.) and another to costs (7.).
COMPENSATION FOR EXPROPRIATION

Art. 6(c) of the BIT contains a quite detailed regulation of the compensation owed for the
expropriation of a protected investment:

“,..(c) The measures shall be taken after fair compensation. Such compensation shall represent
the market value of the affected investments just before the measures are taken or before the
imminent measures are made public knowledge, whichever occurs first; it shall include interest
at a normal commercial rate up to the payment date; and in order to be enforced for the
claimants, it shall be paid and made transferable without undue delay to the country designated
by the interested claimants in the currency of the country of which the claimants are nationals
or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.”

The precept sets three fundamental characteristics that any compensation for expropriation must
have:

- With regard to the amount, the compensation must represent the “market value of the affected
investments”

— With regard to the relevant date, the compensation has to be calculated as of the date “just

before the measures are taken” or if they have been made public knowledge in advance, as of
the date on which the public gained knowledge of them

Ol European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela

Award

— With regard to the currency in which the compensation must be expressed, the precept grants
the expropriated investor an option: it may request it “in the currency of the country of which
the claimants are nationals or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.”

Market value

Both parties agree that the “market value” is the appropriate assessment standard for calculating the

compensation. Both parties also agree on the theoretical definition of the concept:”” it is the price

in cash that a hypothetical buyer would be disposed to pay a hypothetical seller,

- both parties being interested in making the transaction, but with no obligation to do so;

~ both acting in good faith and in accordance with the practices of the market;

—  inan open market and without restrictions; and

- both having reasonable knowledge of the subject of the contract and of the market
conditions.”

There is also agreement between the parties on the currency in which the calculation of the market
value must be made: it must be the VEB, since this is the currency in which both Venezuelan
Companies submitted their annual accounts and in which they developed their business plans.””

Relevant date

The parties also agree that 26 October 2010, the date on which the Expropriation Decree was
published, is the appropriate date for calculating the market value.”"°

Payment currency

One issue is the currency in which the calculation must be made—which is the VEB—and a
separate issue is the currency in which the payment must be made. The Claimant has opted to
submit its claims in USD, an option that is in keeping with the alternative offered to it in Art. 6 in

fine of the BIT.”"' There is also agreement between the parties on which exchange rate is applicable

3 MARKET VALUE

A. Appropriate methodology
653. The first task that the Tribunal must tackle is to determine the proper methodology for calculating

the market value of the expropriated Companies, since the parties’ experts disagree on this
question.

654.  Claimant’s expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, applies three valuation methods in parallel”"*:

- First, he uses the discounted cash flow [(DCF)] method, which attempts to capture the value
of future cash flows of which the company has been deprived as a result of the
expropriation;”"*

Second, he supplements that valuation with two more methods: one that compares the value
of the Companies with other similar companies listed on the stock exchange; and the third
that uses as reference the prices paid in sales of comparable companies.”"*

655. Below are the three valuations weighed by Mr. Kaczmarek, applying 40% to the vale calculated

by the DCF methodology, 40% to the result of comparable companies and 20% to what is derived
from comparable transactions; from this he arrives at a value of the Companies of

USD 999,988,111 for 100% of the capital, which corresponds to compensation of

USD 729,821,323 in favor of the Claimant”"*:

 

 

 

Method Weight Value (USD)
DCF Valuation 40% 1,004,872,625
Comparable companies 40% 977,164,424
Comparable transactions 20% 1,035,866,457
Average weighted valuation 999,988,111
Claimant’s equity interest 72.983%

Methodology of the Respondent

656. | Respondent’s expert, Mr. Guitera, adopted a somewhat different methodology. In his opinion, the
market value should be calculated by applying the DCF methodology only, while the other
methodologies should be used as a simple “sanity check,” in the words of the expert, in order to
corroborate the result achieved.”””

Comparison of the two methodologies
657. The Tribunal tends to agree with the Respondent’s expert.
658. The most widely accepted formula for calculating the market value of a functioning company is
bly the DCF methodol provided that the ise can show that it will generate

a reasonably foreseeable free cash flow in the coming years. This methodology essentially means
the following (using the World Bank’s definition):”!*

 

“[DJiscounted cash flow value’ means the cash receipts realistically expected

from the enterprise in each future year of its economic life as reasonably
projected minus that year's expected cash expenditure, after discounting this net
cash flow for each year by a factor which reflects the time value of money,
expected inflation, and the risk associated with such cash flow under realistic
circumstances. Such discount rate may be measured by examining the rate of
return available in the same market on alternative investments of comparable
risk on the basis of their present value.”

659. The Tribunal believes that use of a DCF-based model is particularly appropriate in the case of
OldV and Favianca. As Mr. Kaczmarek has said:

“In general, what I would say is that this is a very straightforward non-complex
DCF analysis.”

660. Indeed, there are a number of elements that facilitate the use of the DCF methodology in this
case:

- First, both Companies have devoted themselves for nearly half a century to a stable industrial
business in which they use their own technology, which was developed on a worldwide scale
and which gives them an advantage over local competitors.

- Second, they rank first among glass manufacturers in Venezuela, far ahead of their closest
competitor.

- Third, they have a captive customer in the Polar Group, the largest agri-food business group
in Venezuela and also a minority partner in the Companies.

- Fourth, they have a sophisticated business plan [the “Business Plan”],”° which was prepared

prior to expropriation and which the Companies had been developing year by year. This plan

contained highly detailed projections of their future development over the 2010-2013

quadrennium and of their capacity to generate free cash flows.”

There is an additional argument that reaffirms the foregoing. As stated by Mr. Guitera, the
Venezuelan business market has special, unique characteristics, making it advisable to use a
“stand-alone” valuation, such as the DCF methodology, and unadvisable to use methods based on
comparisons to other countries.

“... due to the fact that it is very difficult to come to a value by comparison
between a company in Venezuela, which is a very specific environment, with
other environments, I do not think the multiple approach should be relied [on] as
a primary approach to compute the price, but only as a check [...] which is why I
have applied the DCF and then the check, and not made a kind of weighted
valuation between the two.”

However, while recognizing the prevalence of the DCF methodology, prudence dictates that it
should not be applied mechanically since this could easily lead to a distorted outcome. Any DCF
model is simply the result of plugging some estimated future parameters, as determined by the
expert, into a matt ical formula. If the esti of these turn out to be i

the results will not reflect the true market value of the expropriated asset. Small changes in the
parameters can cause very significant differences in the outcomes.

In view of these risks, all experts agree that the results of a DCF-based model must be checked
using other valuation methods. Mr. Guitera proposes that they be compared with the value of
similar publicly traded companies, or with the actual price at which similar companies have been
sold.

The Tribunal’s preference

The Tribunal agrees with the proposal of Mr. Guitera, as it reflects the most common practice in
this type of valuation.

Mr. Kaczmarek, meanwhile, also proposes that these methodologies be used, not as a “sanity
check,” but as independent values that the expert should weigh alongside the value calculated
using the DCF. The procedure proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek, though less common in practice,

Award

cannot be described as wrong: If a methodology yields a divergent result, the weighting will
moderate its impact. The drawback of this alternative is that the determination of the weighting
percentages is highly subjective: There is no objective reason for using a 40/40/20 weighting
scheme, as opposed to a 60/20/20 scheme or even a 34/33/33 scheme. Mr. Kaczmarek himself has
been unable to provide an objective rationale for why his weighting scheme should be given
preference over other alternatives.

In summary, the Tribunal sides with the methodology proposed by Mr. Guitera and will use it to
determine the market value of the expropriated Companies. To this end it will develop its own
DCF model, determine the resulting valuation, and then check this valuation by comparing it to
the value obtained through the comparable-companies and comparable-transactions
methodologies.

In any event, even though the Tribunal has sided on a theoretical level with the methodology
proposed by Mr. Guitera, as opposed to the one proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek, the use of one or
the other does not have a significant practical impact. Applying Mr. Guitera’s methodology to
Mr. Kaczmarek’s numbers would have the effect of increasing (not reducing!) the market value.
In fact, the DCF valuation of US$1.004 billion calculated by Mr. Kaczmarek is slightly below the
valuation resulting from the weighted average (US$1.000 billion for 100% of OIdV and
Favianca).

Application of the methodology

Mr. Kaczmarek has designed a DCF methodology based on the Business Plan of the expropriated
Companies, which project the cash flows that the expropriated Companies would have reasonably
generated in the 2010-2020 period and which, when discounted at the discount rate deemed
reasonable by the expert, would lead to a valuation of US$1.004 billion (for 100% of both
Companies). The Respondent’s expert, Mr. Guitera, accepts in general terms the model proposed
by Mr. Kaczmarek, including the 2010-2020 time framework, but he proposes that certain
adjustments be made in the cash flow estimates and discount rate, which would reduce the value
to US$195 million (again, referring to 100% of both Companies).”*

Although in absolute terms the results obtained by the two experts are vastly different, these
differences can actually be reduced to five parameters on which the experts maintain opposing
positions:

- Cost of goods sold;

- Increase in sales price;

- Development of exports;

Award

- Investments (capital expenditures, or “capex”) required to operate the business;
- Applicable discount rate.

Each expert has performed his own calculation of the first four parameters, and the Tribunal must
side with the opinion of one or the other (B.). Then, the Tribunal must determine the discount rate
to be applied (C.), which will allow for the calculation—with the help of the Joint Matrix
prepared by both experts—of the Companies’ market value (D.). The Tribunal must then decide
whether this market value should be increased on the grounds that excess cash was expropriated
(E.) or decreased on the grounds that a discount should apply due to the Companies’ specific
characteristics (F.). The resulting value will be checked by using other methodologies (G.), which
will lead to a final summary (H.).

The four points of disagreement
a. The cost of goods sold

The first parameter of the DCF model on which the experts disagree is the production cost of
goods sold, i.e. the total variable costs incurred by the Companies (raw materials, labor, energy,
transport‘) to make the products that are later sold [“Cost of goods sold”].

Position of the experts

In his first report, Claimant’s expert calculates the Cost of goods sold using the following
methodology”:

- Since the Cost of goods sold is variable, he considers it appropriate to determine it as a
percentage of total sales;

- For years 2010-2013, the expert takes the percentages of the Cost of goods sold shown for
each year in the Business Plan of the Companies;”°

- For 2014-2020, Cost of goods sold is established as 63.7%” of sales—the average of the
percentages projected in the Business Plan for each year from 2010-2013.

Mr. Guitera disagrees with these calculations in his first report.” In his opinion, the percentages
proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek are too low, as they rely on the fact that traditionally in Venezuela

4 There has been some confusion over whether Production Costs should or should not include depreciation; see
Kaczmarek IL, n. 52: the Tribunal will take the figures without depreciation.

Award

energy costs have been heavily subsidized, a situation that in the long-term would not be
sustainable. Therefore, Respondent’s expert prepares a different projection:

- During the first five-year period, the Cost of goods sold will increase progressively until
reaching 70%” of sales in 2015;

- As from 2016, the Costs will stabilize at 70%.

The Republic’s expert noted that the Companies generate a profit margin that is higher by
approximately 5% over that obtained by other companies of the OI group in South America; in
his opinion, this increased profitability is due to subsidized energy prices in Venezuela and
cannot be maintained in the long-term.””

In his second report, Mr. Kaczmarek defends his calculation and rejects Mr. Guitera’s. In his
opinion, the Cc ies have i achieved ing results superior to those
of other subsidiaries of the OI group in South America. Having a decade of financial information
prior to 2010 that repeatedly shows such advantage, there is no reason to exclude it from future
projections.”

Mr. Guitera in turn reiterated in his second report the same conclusions reached in the first.’”? In
his view, it is unrealistic to think that energy costs will remain static until 2020, and therefore he
believes that his model, which implicitly includes an increase in energy costs of 2.9% of sales in
2010 to 7.9% in 2020, is more realistic. Even with this increase, energy costs for the Companies
would continue to be lower than the typical percentage applied in the glass industry, which would
be 15-25%.”

During the hearing, both experts had the opportunity to explain their positions.”

The Tribunal’s Decision

Both experts are in agreement on the basic philosophy of how the Operating Costs are to be
calculated in the model. Because they are a variable expense, it is appropriate to determine them

as a percentage of sales. Where the two experts disagree is on the precise formula for calculating
that percentage:

- Mr. Kaczmarek uses the forecasts for the first quadrennium contained in the Business
Plan app: by the pany, and for the ini ium uses the average of the
percentages of the initial quadrennium, which is 63.7%;

 

- Mr. Guitera, on the other hand, increases the percentage of costs proportionally until it
teaches 70% in 2015, and maintains this percentage unchanged until 2020.

Although the difference between the two experts is apparently minor, its impact on the market
value is very significant: other things being equal, the value of the Companies falls by
approximately 30% from USD 1.004 billion to USD 701 million,”** depending on which forecast
is used.

After weighing the arguments of both experts, the arbitral Tribunal on this point favors the
Claimant’s position. The following arguments justify this decision:

First, the arguments of the Claimant’s expert are strengthened by the fact that his figures are
based on the Business Plan prepared by the Companies in 2010, before they were expropriated.”
In the Tribunal’s opinion, this business plan has a high level of reliability:

- It was prepared by the Companies’ Venezuelan managers, who, in their forecasts, used
historical, audited, and apparently very reliable financial data and their in-depth
knowledge of the Venezuelan market;

- It was prepared on a date which had no relationship with the current dispute, when there
was no indication that the Companies might be expropriated;

- Its purpose was to prepare a model for the Companies’ development and to create a
yardstick for judging the quality of management; therefore, they had no incentive to make
overly optimistic projections, because if they were wrong it would reflect badly on their
judgment.

The figures proposed by Mr. Guitera, however, are of his own making, and there is no factual
basis to support them (the figure of 70%, which is central to his entire calculation is a simple
estimate, and no arguments have been put forward to justify it; nor is there any support for the
increase in energy costs from 2.9% of sales in 2010 to 7.9% in 2020).

Second. the figures proposed by the Claimant’s expert do not assume that the Cost of goods sold,
especially energy costs, will remain static throughout the decade. These costs will increase in

proportion to sales, which increase as a result of inflation.””

Third, Mr. Guitera starts from the premise that during the triennium 2007-2009 the Venezuelan
Companies obtained profits that consistently outperformed those made by other OI subsidiaries in
South America by 4-5% annually.” In his opinion, this additional return is exclusively due to
low energy costs in Venezuela and it should disappear as the subsidies are reduced.

However, Mr. Guitera has not analyzed whether the higher profitability might be partly or wholly
due to other causes.

It is a fact that the Venezuelan Companies had two factories with the most advanced
technology,”” which had a dominant position in the market,”° and that the Venezuelan consumer
has a clear preference for glass.”' These factors might explain—at least partly—the superior
performance of OldV and Favianca compared to the other companies in the Ol Group. Mr.
Guitera has not analyzed this alternative so as to rule it out, and this makes his figures less
capable of convincing.

Fourth, on the date of the expropriation (26 October 2010, which is the relevant date for making
the assumptions underlying the model) there was no indication at all that Venezuela intended to
change its energy policy.

The Bolivarian Republic is one of the largest producers of oil and gas in the world, and for
decades it has been implementing a policy of low prices for domestic and industrial internal
consumption—so much so that the low price of fuel is the main (or one of the main) competitive

ages of Vi | ing ies. The di expert has failed to
provide proof that in 2010 there was a perceived significant risk of increase in the industrial
prices of petroleum products.

 

On the contrary, the records contain an internal Ol report of October 2008, which analyses the
energy situation in Venezuela, and reaches the conclusion that

“We do not foresee any energy price increase in Venezuela””*

Fifth, even assuming that the Bolivarian Republic were to decide to change its energy policy and
significantly increase fuel prices, the Venezuelan Companies would always have had the
opportunity to pass that increase in costs on to the final purchaser by raising prices—especially

because they had a dominant position in the Venezuelan glass market, which would allow them to
set prices. This option is not merely theoretical, since the same internal OI report of 2008 that
concludes that the risk of price increases is low also explicitly states that, if an increase were to
occur, it could be offset by passing the increased costs on to the customers:”**

 

“The cost in ent in energy is transferred to our thru price ii

For the reasons stated, the Tribunal considers that the Cost of goods sold forecast by Mr.
Kaczmarek seem more reasonable than those forecast by Mr. Guitera, and therefore it opts for the
former.

b. Increase in sales prices

The second point of disagreement between the experts relates to the increase in sales prices of
glass.

Position of the experts

Mr. Kaczmarek bases his first report on the Business Plan prepared in 2010 by the Companies,
which projected an average annual increase in prices in the four years from 2010 to 2013 of
30.6%, which is the result of adding an expected annual inflation rate of 28% plus a real annual
increase in prices of 2.6%.”* The expert considers these projections to be good, but for years
2014-2020 he assumes that prices will not undergo additional real increases and that they would
only adjust for inflation (long-term projection of 14% annually).”*°

Mr. Guitera analyses these expectations in his first report, agreeing with some of the projections
of Claimant’s expert, but disagreeing with others. He agrees that from 2014 until 2020 the prices
of glass sold by the Companies will increase at the same rate as inflation. But he is not willing to
accept the expectation that in the four years from 2011 — 2013, prices will grow at a rate of 2.6%
above inflation.”

In his second report, expert Mr. Kaczmarek stresses that historical results confirm his position: in
the five-year period from 2005 to 2009, the Companies were able to raise prices above inflation

each year adding a margin of 5.2%. These facts would justify an expected increase of 2.6% per
year for the first four-year period.””

Mr. Kaczmarek’s arguments did not convince Mr. Guitera. In his second report, he accepts that
historically prices had risen above inflation, but he adds that historical comparisons are not a
sound basis to justify similar future increases.”** Specifically, he identifies two reasons why he
considers that the projected increases above inflation are unrealistic:

- First, because the projected price increases for the four-year period of 2010 — 2013 contained
in the Business Plan show large variations, ranging from -1.8% in 2010 to +9.9% in 2012; the
expert particularly disagrees with the latter figure, as he does not find any justification to
support such a large increase;”"°

- Second, the expert draws attention to the fact that significant price increases obtained in the
five-year period from 2005 — 2009 coincided with a growth phase of the Venezuelan per
capita GDP. However, after 2009 this indicator would begin to decline, suffering a decline of
- 2.8% that year. Mr. Guitera believes that in such a macroeconomic situation, it would be
impossible to raise prices.

During the hearing, both experts explained their positions in this regard.”
The Tribunal’s Decision

The two experts disagree on the sale prices of the glass manufactured by the Companies. They
agree that in the period 2014-2020 prices will increase in parallel with inflation (which is forecast
at 14% per year—a point on which they also agree). They do not agree, however, on the price
increases in the first quadrennium (2010-2013). Mr. Kaczmarek takes the figures from the
Business Plan prepared by the management, which includes a real increase of 2.6% above
inflation, while Mr. Guitera argues that it should not be included.

The Tribunal favors the position defended by Mr. Kaczmarek, for the following reasons:

First, Mr. Kaczmarek’s position is based on the figures contained in the Business Plan, for which,
in the Tribunal’s opinion, there is a presumption of reasonableness.

Secondly, on this point the Business Plan is pessimistic rather than optimistic. In the preceding
quinquennium (2004-2009) the Companies had managed to increase sale prices by 5.2% per year

above inflation. This justifies a forecast for the following quadrennium of 2.6%, which is exactly
half the historical percentage increase.

The Respondent’s Counter-arguments

702. The dent has counter-argued that historical price i have been possible as a result of
the economic boom in Venezuela during the years 2005-2008, but that this situation would have
changed in 2009, making a real price increase policy impossible in the future. As evidence of this
statement, Mr. Guitera uses the GDP per capita index in USD to purchase power parity which had

declined in 2009 and 2010, as seen in the following chart:

703. The Tribunal cannot agree with this argument.

704. The most common index for measuring a nation’s growth rate is the increase in GDP growth
(positive or negative)—an index which also appears in the graph prepared by Mr. Guitera.”*!
According to this indicator, the V 1 momy grew i ly during the si:
from 2005-2010 (in percentages, ranging from 5% to 15%), with no noticeable slow-down at the
end of the sixennium: in 2009 and 2010, growth rates were even higher than in 2005 and 2006.
From the graph prepared by the expert, indications are that during 2009 and 2010, GDP growth
was greater than 10%.

705. It is evident, according to data from Mr. Guitera that the GDP per capita in USD in relation to the
purchase power parity entered into negative growth in 2009 and 2010. How can real GDP growth be

justified while GDP per capita in USD in relation to the purchase power parity decreases? The expert
does not provide any justification and the Tribunal merely notes that one index is calculated based

on VEB and the other on USD, and the differences could be due to the continuous devaluation of
the VEB against the USD.

In any event, regardless of the macro-economic realities which affect or fail to impact the
Venezuelan economy, such facts alone are unable to undermine the reasoning for the forecasts
outlined in the Business Plan. As the Venezuelan economy grows more or less at the macro level, it
does not necessarily determine the price which Companies receive from the sale of their range of
products at the micro level.

The same is true with regard to fluctuations in price increases for each year of the quadrennium,
another of the ite by the Resp 's expert. These f ‘ions appear
to follow the forecasts of the guidelines regarding the introduction of new products into the market,
and do not detract from, but on the contrary, confirm the accuracy with which the forecasts were
made.

c. The inclusion of imports

The third point of disagreement between the experts concerns Companies’ expectation of being
able to resume their exports.

Experts’ Position

In its DCF model, Mr. Kaczmarek includes the exportation of glass, an activity which the
Companies had carried out up to 2006, which—according to his assertions— there were plans to
restart in 2011. The projected exports represent 1.22% of the domestic sales for 2011, 2.44% for
2012 and 3.66% for the years between 2013 and 2020.”

The expert, Mr. Guitera estimates that it is illogical to envisage exports. In his opinion, exports in
the past have been erratic, and were based on promptly taking advantage of opportunities and not
on a rational growth strategy. Besides, there were hardly any exports from 2005.755

In his second report, Mr. Kaczmarek recognizes that from 2005, the export volume fell significantly. In
justifying this, he explains that in view of the high demand for glass bottles in Venezuela’s domestic
market, in 2005, the Companies ceased exporting. Although in 2008 and 2009, they made attempts to
resume, administrative restrictions prevented them from doing so. The expert further states that the
average figure for exports in the quinquennium 2001 to 2005 was 3.7% of total sales, and he reaffirms
that the forecasts were reasonable.’**

Ol European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

712. Mr. Kaczmarek’s line of argument did not satisfy the expert, Mr. Guitera. In his second report, the
Jatter places emphasis on the fact that the Business Plan does not include any export forecast, that
the cost structure worked out by Mr. Kaczmarek does not include any forecast whatsoever of
additional costs required for exports, and that from a distance of more than 250 miles, the
transportation of glass bottles reduces the competitiveness of the product.”*°

713. In his Summary of Conclusions, the Claimant insists that in the years 2007 and 2008, the Companies
would have resumed exporting, and that they failed to do so only because administrative restrictions
made it impossible. Proof of this resides in the fact that Venvidrio, the public Company which is not
subject to administrative restrictions would have resumed exports to Brazil in particular.”° The
Respondent, on the other hand, reaffirms in his conclusions that there is absolutely no basis for
including possible exports in the DCF model.’*”

The Tribunal’s Decision

714. In this case, the Tribunal adopts position endorsed by the expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, and agrees that it
is reasonable to include an exports projection in the DCF model. He reasons as follows:

715. First of all, the Tribunal finds that both experts concur that until 2006, the Companies regularly
engaged in exporting, and that in that year they were suspended and not reinstated. However, it
finds the claim by the Claimant and its expert is credible in stating that the reason there were no
exports in 2008 and 2009 was not for a lack of interest on the part of the Companies but instead for
bureaucratic and currency control issues.

716. Secondly, the Tribunal finds it likely that a hypothetical buyer would consider the fact that the
Companies previously had successful export activities, and it would assume that they could be
reinstated (especially given positive relations with the Administration that would in turn overcome
holdups) and it would include in the offer price a small premium to account for this potential
additional business. The difference between including and excluding the exports in the market
value is approximately USD 17 million, ceteris paribus.”*

717. Good evidence that the Plants had export capacity and that a hypothetical buyer could have
recognized it is the fact that, after the expropriation and already under the control of Venvidrio,
they immediately began exporting in significant quantities.”

758 Joint Matrix, pg. 2

75° CV, para 206: here, it states the problem with the value of the facts occurring after the appropriation. As Mr.
Guitera correctly states, what the Court has to calculate is the market value of the Companies as of the date of
expropriation that a hypothetical buyer would have paid for them, considering the information available at that time.
What is telling are the expectations as of the date of expropriation. Later exports are only an indicator; the
determining factor is the expectations of a hypothetical buyer as of the date of valuation.

There is still a counter-argument to be analyzed. Though the Business Plan does not provide for

any export activity, the Tribunal understands that this exclusion is not an express waiver of the

ability to export. Instead, it means that the Ol group directors had lost any hope that the
would lift the inistrative holdups pi g them.

 

d. Capital expenditures (“capex”) required to operate the business

The fourth and final disagreement between the experts regarding the parameters of the DCF model
relates to the need for investment—capex in financial jargon.

Experts’ position

(i) In his initial report, the expert, Mr. Kaczmarek starts from the investments anticipated in the
Business Plan prepared in 2010 by the Companies, to determine the capex necessary in the
quadrennium 2010-2013 (which amounts to 4%, 3%, 5% and 7% of sales anticipated, respectively).
For the period 2014-2020, the expert estimates that investments will reach 6.4% of sales. He
arrives at this percentage by calculating the average for the decade 2004-2013.”

(ii) On the other hand, the expert, Mr. Guitera estimates that these forecasts are extremely low.”*
He that the Ci ies have been und ing in the Plants, which would have
resulted in deterioration of their equipment. As evidence of this situation of under-investment, as
well as general deterioration of the Plants, the expert refers to

 

- information that would have facilitated the management of Venvidrio, and

- a report on Envidrio [sic] for 2011, according to which the ovens were showing an elevated
level of wear.

In order to correct this situation of under-investment, the expert proposes that the investment
average for the 2000-2009 decade be used for the 2010-2020 period.

He also points out that Mr. Kaczmarek has selected the 2004-2013 decade to calculate the average
investment required, without taking into consideration the fact that in the years 2000-2003, the
investment percentage had been very high. In summary, in the quadrennium 2000-2003, the capex
percentage reached 20%, 16%, 16% and 10% of sales. This would support his opinion that the

Award

average selected by Mr. Kaczmarek—the 2004-2013 decade—is not a good reference for
establishing the investment levels required for the 2014-2020 period.

For this reason, taking into consideration the fact that the investment percentage in sales was 15.5%
in the quadrennium 2000 to 2003, and that it fell to 10% during the 2000-2010 period, the expert,
Mr. Guitera is exaggerating by using this last figure.’

(iii) In his second report, the expert, Mr. Kaczmarek reaffirms the correctness of his calculation.
Upholding the statements of the directors of the Ol, Messrs Machaen and Gémez, he denies that the OI
under-invested in their Venezuelan Plants, and in his appendix N, he provides the complete figures in
USD invested from 2000 to 2010 which range between a minimum of USD 10.6 million in 2004 and a
maximum of USD 23.5 million in 2006. Besides, he points out that in the years 2002 and 2006, there
was expansion in the production capacity installed (from 1,356 tons/day in 2002 to 1,433 tons/day in
2006)—which exceeds the capacity required by the DCF model, which goes only to 1,250 tons/day.”

(iv) In his second report, Mr. Guitera explains that his calculation is based on investments in VEB
made in the period 2000-2010, which includes a sub-period of important investments related to
sales (2000-2003) and another of less significant investments (2004-2010). Throughout the period,
the average amount of investment was 10% of sales, a percentage which the expert proposes to use
for the entire period 2010-2020. He emphasizes that for this calculation it is of no importance
whether the Plants are in poor condition as regards maintenance (as Venvidrio states), or not (as
Mr. Kaczmarek claims).’

As regards amounts actually invested between 2000 and 2010, Mr. Guitera casts doubt on the USD
figures presented in appendix N to Mr. Kaczmarek’s report. In his opinion, these figures reflect the
investment amounts authorized by the parent company, whereas the relevant figures are in the
audited accounts of the Companies which are quoted in VEB. The expert compares both amounts
and finds discrepancies between them and those that have not been verified.”*

Mr. Guitera also analyses table 7 in the second report of the expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, in which details of
repair work on the ovens, carried out in the period 2000-2010 is set out together with those anticipated
for the years 2011-2015. He points out that according to this table, in the quadrennium 2010-2013—
the period to which the Business Plan refers—it is anticipated that the ovens will be refurbished three
times. In his opinion, these projections require significant investment inputs, without which it would

be impossible to maintain the low ratio level of investment expected in the Business Plan—4%, 3.5%,
4.5% and 6.6% of sales for each year of the quadrennium.”©

(v) During the hearing, the experts had the opportunity to explain their positions.””

(vi) Mr. Guitera explained what, in his opinion, might have caused OI to under-invest in their
Venezuelan Plants:"**

- The first would be the continuous devaluation of the VEB against the USD, which would
oblige the group to devalue investments made in Venezuela;

- The second would be the lack of confidence in the political situation, which also would have
caused the OI group to minimize their exposure to country risk.

During his examination process, in response to questions relating to the Claimant’s attorneys, Mr.
Guitera recognized that he had made an error in his calculations: he had calculated the average of
the results for the years 2000-2010 in the erroneous belief that these represented 10 years, when, in
reality they were 11. In his opinion, in order to calculate the average correctly, he should have
excluded a year, and he proposes the exclusion of the year 2010 (since it was in October of this
year that the Companies were expropriated). With this correction, the ten-year average would
exceed 10% (calculated on an 11-year basis) to 10.8 %—which in turn, would require a reduction
of the market value of the Companies by approximately USD 50 million.”* Mr. Guitera promised
to present new calculations in which the error would be corrected and this was done by the Parent
company.”

(vii) In their Summary of Conclusions, the Claimant points out that Mr. Guitera has not taken into
consideration the Business Plan prepared by the Companies for the quadrennium 2010-2013, and
has changed this by a massive increase in the capital expenditure, amounting to USD 85 million,
without explaining what the investment had entailed.”

(viii) The Respondent, for his part, indicates that his expert has used the data of a complete
industrial cycle, so as to be able to correctly forecast future data. As regards the life cycle of the
ovens, the witness, Mr. Machen would have referred to 10 years, while the other witness, Mr. Pazos,
would have extended this to 14 years. Using historical data for 10 years would then seem to be a
reasonable proposal. The duration of the cycle would discredit the methodology used by Mr.
Kaczmarek, who used only six years.

The Tribunal’s Decision

734. This dispute revolves around the appropriate capex level that should be included in the DCF
model.

735. Mr. Kaczmarek proposes using two calculations: in the first quadrennium, he selects figures
contained in the Companies’ Business Plan (some low percentages of 4%, 3.5%, 4.5% and 6.6%
on sales) and for the rest of the period (2014-2020) he takes the mean for the period of 2004—
2013, which is 6.4%.

736. Mr. Guitera, on the other hand (and after a clear error in his calculation was corrected) uses the
mean investment for the decade from 2000-2009 (10.8%) and applies it evenly over the period of
2010-2020.

737. In order to resolve this dispute, the Tribunal will proceed as follows: (i) first, it will gather
available data regarding investments in the Companies; (ii) second, it will analyze the credibility
of the data used by the Companies in their Business Plan; next, it will do the same with the data
proposed by (iii) Mr. Kaczmarek and (iv) Mr. Guitera.

(i) Available Data

738. — Historically, the Companies reached the following investment levels (in % on sales)”

 

[2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | (2010
[20% | 16% | 16% | 10% | 6% | 9% | 9% | 9% | 6% | 7% | [2%]

739. The year 2010 should be excluded from this historical series because that is when the
expropriation occurred, and therefore the data is not comparable.

740. Notably, the other data shows that in the first three years of the decade, the investment level was
significant (16%-20%), and dropped in the following seven, fluctuating between a 6% low and a
10% high.

741. The Business Plan that the Companies projected for the quadrennium 2010-2013 [showed]
significantly lower percentages:

ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

(ii) Credibility of the Business Plan data

The Tribunal continually expressed its respect for the data contained in the Business Plan
generated by the directors of the Companies, and it has generally accepted its projections as
satisfactory. It is questionable whether this acceptance should also be extended to the projected
investments.

The doubt arises because the projected investments for the quadrennium 2010-2014 are, by far,
the lowest since the year 2000, which is when the historical series begins:

= In the decade 2000-2009, which predates the expropriation, the projected investment
never dropped lower than 6%; it remained at that level for two years, but was higher in
the remaining eight, reaching 16% in two years and even 20% in one;

be however, the Business Plan for the quadrennium 2010-2014 projects that in one year, the
6% (the historical low) will repeat and in the remaining three, the percentage will be
approximately 4%, figures that are lower than the minimum in the historical series by one
third.

What could such low investment projections be attributed to?

The expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, has not provided a specific answer to this question. He has limited
himself to accepting the figures because they appear in the Business Plan and reflect what the OI
group expected to invest in the Companies during the quadrennium.

Mr. Guitera, on the other hand, maintains a different interpretation. In his opinion, the Companies
were already suffering an under-investment situation, which the Business Plan would only
exacerbate. The under-investment would be a decision considered by OI group, which sought to
limit its losses and reduce the country risk in Venezuela.”

In fact, the Business Plan shows that in the next quadrennium OI was actually planning low
investment levels in its Venezuelan affiliates.

That, however, is not the problem to be addressed.

The issue is whether a hypothetical investor that reviewed the Companies’ Business Plan would
have shared this attitude, agreed to include in its valuation that the investment levels in the first
quadrennium after purchase would be the decade’s lowest by far. The doubt is bolstered by the
fact that OIEG has not justified the low investment levels projected for that quadrennium.

750. | Mr. Guitera theorizes that OI group would not want to increase the country risk for Venezuela.
The Tribunal does not have any elements to validate or reject this theory. However, it finds that a
hypothetical buyer would have the Plants undergo an exhaustive review, with results similar to
those reached by Venvidrio in the report it prepared for the Venezuelan government. Generally,
the latter found the Plants to be in good condition, although it found that certain ovens required
additional investments.’*

751. — This conclusion coincides with the C ies’ plans themselves, which expected to have four

= and at the same time, reductions were projected in investment percentages (which would
go from a mean of 7.66% in the historical sexennium to 4.65% in the projected
quadrennium).

In summary, the Tribunal concludes that the investment levels projected in the Business Plan for
the quadrennium 2010-2013 reflected the plans of OI, and that it was likely that a hypothetical
buyer would have rejected these investment levels, and substituted them for others which were
higher and closer to the mean of the historical average.

(iii) Credibility of the data proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek

For the first quadrennium, Mr. Kaczmarek proposes using the investment levels included in the
Business Plan. For the years 2014-2020, he proposes taking the mean of the percentages for the
10 years immediately preceding (2004-2013), which comes out to 6.4%,

The mean proposed by the expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, (6.4%) is clearly too low:

- First, because he excludes the calculation for the four years of the historical series, when
the investment was higher (2000-2003: 20%; 16%, 16%; 10%), and replaces them with
the projection of the Business Plan for the quadrennium 2010-2013 which, for
unsubstantiated reasons, projects minimum investment levels (4%; 3.5%; 4.5%; 6.6%);

- Second, because the 6.4% that he selects is the lowest piece of date in the historical
series, equaled only in the years 2004 and 2008; which the eight remaining entries in the
historical series are all above 6% (and some significantly higher).

 

Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the projection by Mr. Kaczmarek for the sexennium 2014—
2020 (6.4%) is too optimistic, given that, historically, the Companies’ investment levels had been
significantly higher.
(iv) Credibility of the data proposed by Mr. Guitera

The proposal by Mr. Guitera involves two decisions:
to First, it means not considering the projections contained in the Business Plan;
= Second, [it means] establishing a single percentage for the period of 2010-2020, which in

the opinion of the expert must be equal to the mean reached in the prior decade (2000-

2009), which is 10.8%.

Both proposals by Mr. Guitera seem reasonable.

OJ European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

The Tribunal has already explained why it finds that the projections in the Business Plan for the
quadrennium 2010-2013 must not be considered. It would therefore seem reasonable to assume
that a hypothetical buyer would have included in his valuation model for the Companies some
higher investment percentages starting with the acquisition period itself.

Which ones?

Mr. Guitera proposes adopting the mean investment percentage resulting from the historical
series of the last decade prior to expropriation (2000-2009) and applying it equally over the
period of 2010-2020. This is conflicting data taken from annual audited accounts that cover a
long series coinciding approximately with the life cycle of glass manufacturing machinery. The
proposal by the expert, Mr. Guitera, seems reasonable and the Tribunal adopts it.

Discount rate

Once the Tribunal has settled the four points of disagreement regarding the DCF model in
discussion with the experts, it remains to establish the rate at which future fluctuations in the funds
generated by the Companies will be discounted, so as to bring them up-to-date financially with
regard to the expropriation. On this question, the experts are in agreement that the appropriate
discount rate is the WACC (the weighted average cost of capital), but they again disagree on the
exact quantification: Mr. Kaczmarek proposes 20.39% while Mr. Guitera proposes 25.78% (bear in
mind that the greater the discount rate, the less will be the market value of the company).

Before analyzing this discrepancy, the Tribunal would like to establish that the calculation of the
discount rate is only useful in specific cases, and that the conclusions reached in a particular
proceeding cannot be generalized and may not be mechanically extrapolated as regards another
situation—even though one is dealing with a company in a similar sector, and one in the same country.
The calculation is a specific task, which depends on the individual characteristics of each case,
especially given the way in which the Company is being financed, how each DCF model is
constructed and alternatives selected by the experts. There is no single formula for calculating the
discount rate. Moreover, in each case, the decision of a tribunal is predetermined by the arguments and
counter-arguments made and the proof brought forward by the experts and the parties.

a. Model developed by Kaczmarek

In his first report, Mr. Kaczmarek concludes that the appropriate discount rate, that is to say, the
Companies’ WACC, should be 20.39%. In arriving at this total, the expert takes the following

steps:””

Cost of equity

765. (i) He first calculates the cost of equity, applying the CAPM formula:

Figure 18 - CAPM Formula

 

CAPM = Rf + 8 * EMRP + CRP

Where:

R; = Risk Free Rate of Return

& = Beta

EMRP = Equity Market Risk Premium
CRP = Country Risk Premium

 

 

 

766. In this formula, each of the items has the following values:

- Rg: is the total US bond yield (2.06%), plus the expected rate of inflation in Venezuela
(16.45%), totaling 18.85%;

- 6: represents the volatility of a particular company with regard to the overall market; since
this has not been quoted by the Companies, the expert calculates it based on a number of
companies with similar characteristics; after balancing the result, the expert arrives at a
figure of 0.613;

- EMRP: is the investment premium for equity; the expert estimates this at 5%.

- CRP: this refers to the country risk premium, which Mr. Kaczmarek establishes to
be 2%.

767. Using these values, the expert calculates the cost of equity to be 23.91%.”*
Debt cost

768. (ii) The next step is to determine the debt cost, after tax. For that, he uses the average rate of
interest on loans in VEB to companies in Venezuela over the three-year period prior to

expropriation, which is 20.65%. Having deduced that there is a negative impact (at a rate of 34%),
the debt cost after taxes remains at 13.63%.

WACC

(iii) Once the costs of equity and the debt have been determined, the expert will then be in a
position to calculate the WACC (which equals the discounted rate). To do so, take the capital
structure of competi ies in the packaging sector, as i d by BI g. The average
capital structure of these comparable companies was 66% equity and 34% debt. Accepting these
weighted averages, the Companies’ WACC is established at 20.39%, pursuant to the following
chart:

WACC Component Amount
Capital Cost 23.91%
% of Capital 66%
Cost of Debt after Taxes 13.63%

Cost of Weighted Average Capital 20.39% _|

 

Points of Disagreement by Mr. Guitera

Mr. Guitera generally accepts the system for calculating the discounted rate proposed by Mr.
Kaczmarek, but he disagrees on the way in which Mr. Kaczmarek has calculated five items:

- First of all, he disagrees with the CRP calculation; this is the country risk in which Mr.
Kaczmarek proposes a 2% premium and Mr. Guitera proposes a 6% premium (b).

- Secondly, he disagrees on the amount set for the beta in which Mr. Kaczmarek is alleging
0.613, whereas Mr. Guitera. prefers 0.687 and he disagrees on the debt to equity ratio to be
used in the calculation (c).

- Third, he disagrees with the cost of the before taxes debt, which Mr. Kaczmarek believes
should be 20.65% and Mr. Guitera believes should be 22.42% (d); and

- Fourth, Mr. Guitera wishes to add a specific risk premium due to the Companies’ features of
2% that Mr. Kaczmarek rejects (e).

In applying these four items to the WACC formula as Mr. Guitera proposes the result is a
discounted rate of 25.78%.

b. Country Risk

772. Mr. Kaczmarek proposes applying a country risk rate of 2% to the Bolivarian Republic of

Venezuela, whereas Mr. Guitera proposes a rate of 6%,

OI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

Finding of the Tribunal

The rate of 6% proposed by Mr. Guitera is derived from the country risk table developed by Prof.
Damodaran, who is without a doubt an important authority on assessing companies’ worth and who
publishes tables on country risk for all countries in the world. The proposal by the Defendant's
expert is consistent with what the usual practices are for assessing companies: one uses the tables
with calculations of risk premiums by countries and one applies the number proposed by the table.
These tables generally make the calculation by comparing the public debt spreads of different
countries as well as other ancillary factors. Of all of the existing tables, Prof. Damodaran’s tables
are the most universal.

As a result, the Tribunal establishes, as its first finding, that the calculation made by Mr. Guitera is
consistent with the normal practice in the financial world of assessing companies.

Mr. Kaczmarek’s proposal

The rate proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek for Venezuela’s country risk is the comparatively low figure
of 2%, which on Prof. Damodaran’s tables corresponds to the country risk of a country like Italy.

How can one justify his proposing to apply to Venezuela a country risk corresponding to Italy,
which is a country that at first blush would seem to be more stable and predictable?

The explanation that the expert offers is as follows: the government of the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela has been implementing a policy of expropriations and it has repeatedly expropriated
privately owned companies. This government policy causes a general depreciation in the value of
Venezuelan companies and this general effect should be excluded from the model. He therefore
proposes that the legal, regulatory and policy risks that are controlled by the State be excluded from
the calculation of the discounted rate.” As a result, Mr. Kaczmarek, even if he agrees that
according to Prof. Damodaran’s tables the country risk for Venezuela is 6%, believes that for the
purposes of calculating the value of expropriated companies this should be lowered to a simple 2%.

The Tribunal does not share the expert’s position for the following reasons:

First of all. because the figure of 2% is simply an estimate made by Mr. Kaczmarek and there is no
indication of the methodology used for the calculation, nor has the basis for it been demonstrated in
outside sources.

Secondly, a risk premium of 2% is one that corresponds to a country like Italy, not to a country like
Venezuela. An investor who is considering making the same investment in a developed country or,
alternatively, in a developing country, will frequently choose the developed country, unless he is
offered an opportunity to obtain higher profits in the developing country. This disadvantage that

Award

developing countries have is what is captured through the country risk premium. It makes no sense
for Italy and Venezuela to share the same premium level.

781. Third, Mr. Kaczmarek seeks to justify the 2% premium and dismisses the 6% premium by referring
to the “negative messages in the business environment about potential expropriations””™° that
Venezuela would have generated.

782. While it is true that the numerous expropriations that have occurred in Venezuela may be perceived
by investors as “negative messages,” it has not been demonstrated that those negative messages
have managed to cause a four percentage point increase in Venezuela’s country risk premium. Prof.
Damodaran’s calculation is based on the Venezuelan public debt non-compliance spread, which is
approximately 4% multiplied by the relative volatility of the stock markets vis-a-vis the debt
markets, which is a factor of 1.5.”! This calculation bears no relation whatsoever with the
microeconomic policies implemented by the Republic.

783. In summary, the Tribunal finds that in the CAPM formula, the “CRP” addend, which is
Venezuela’s country risk, should be equal to 6, as proposed by Mr. Guitera, and not equal to 2, as
Mr. Kaczmarek alleges.

c Calculating the beta coefficient and the debt-to-equity ratio

784. The two experts disagree on technical aspects of the calculation of the B coefficient and the debt-to-
equity ratio: Mr. Kaczmarek proposes a B coefficient of 0.613 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 34/66
(52%), while Mr. Guitera prefers a B of 0.687 and a ratio of 29/71 (41%).””

Calculation of the B coefficient

785. The disagreement over the calculation of the B has a bearing on a technical point: whether the
average of the listed companies used to calculate the B should be weighted or simple. Mr. Kaczmarek
has used a weighted average of seven listed companies and given more value to those which he
considers most similar,”* while Mr. Guitera defends a simple average of the same values.”**

786. The Tribunal opts for Mr. Kaczmarek’s solution.

787. Not all the comparable companies that are part of the sample have the same level of similarity to the
company being value. Therefore, it seems reasonable to allow the valuer to give a higher weighting to

those that are most similar. Assuming that the weightings are reasonable, a weighted average will
be more accurate than a simple average. At no time has Mr. Guitera said that the weightings given
by Mr. K Kk are i priate—his line of is that weighting is rare in practice.”**

 

Debt-to-equity ratio

The two experts also disagree on how to calculate the debt-to-equity ratio needed to regear the B
and determine the WACC.

Mr. Kaczmarek made the calculation by using a sample of 16 companies in the packaging sector,
which is a broader sample than that used to calculate the B.”*° The Respondent’s expert does not
agree. In his opinion, the sample should have been the same.”*”

The Tribunal, while recognizing that both approaches are reasonable, opts for Mr. Kaczmarek’s
solution, not so much because its methodology is more convincing, but because the results obtained
seem more accurate,

Mr. Kaczmarek adheres to the following methodology: he identifies a sample of seven listed
companies that are comparable to the Companies and uses the weighted average of the B
coefficients to determine the ungeared B of the expropriated companies. He then regears the B
coefficients, using the debt-to-equity ratio not of those seven companies, but of a sample of 16
companies. This same ratio is then used in the calculation of the WACC. The expert justifies the
use of the two samples by arguing that the first represents the greatest possible similarity to the
expropriated Companies, while the second represents the packaging industry in general.’*

Mr. Guitera disagrees: in his opinion, the same sample should have been used for the calculation of
the B, for its regearing, and for the calculation of the WACC. He considers that Mr. Kaczmarek’s
methodology creates unacceptable inconsistencies and distorts the calculations, and it is something
which he has never seen applied.”*°

From a strictly methodological point of view, the Tribunal tends to share Mr. Guitera’s position. It
seems preferable that the same sample be used for the calculation of the f, for its regearing, and for
the calculation of the WACC, which are three interrelated calculations. This does not mean that the
methodology adopted by Mr. Kaczmarek is erroneous because calculation of the WACC is not an
exact science, and the rules of the art allow the use of different methodologies.

Ol European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

In reality, however, the practical application made by Mr. Guitera leads to results that are not
reasonable: he takes the same sample of seven values developed by Mr. Kaczmarek (which the
latter had chosen, not because they represent the industry, but because they are similar to the
Companies) and uses it to make the triple calculation. The result is a debt-to-equity ratio of 29/71
(41%), which indicates that in the global packaging industry more than 70% of funding is obtained
from equity capital and less than 30% comes from outside sources; in other words, the level of
gearing is very low.

Mr. Kaczmarek has provided convincing evidence to show that such a low level of gearing is not
reasonable and that the figure which he proposes (34/66 or 52%) is more accurate. For this we refer
to Ibbotson’s Cost of Capital Report, a reputable source, which gives a ratio of 61% for the glass
industry in 2010.” He has also provides the opinion of an analyst in 2010, which gives one a ratio
of 55.9% for the packaging industry.’""

Why is it that Mr. Guitera, while applying a better methodology, reaches inappropriate results? The
reason is probably that by mimetically copying the sample of seven companies created by Mr.
Kaczmarek he is using an inadequate sample. It would have been appropriate to create his own
sample and apply it consistently in the triple calculation.

C ly, the Tribunal iders that the data calculated by Mr. K: k are more accurate
and reasonable, and opts to use a B of 0.613 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 34/66 (52%).

d. Cost of Debt
Another point on which the experts disagree is the cost of debt.

Mr. Kaczmarek takes as a reference the average cost of financing for companies, expressed in
Venezuelan currency, in the three years prior to the date of expropriation and arrives at a figure of
20.65% (which is reduced to 13.63% after tax). ”*

Mr. Guitera does not agree with that calculation. Although he accepts that it is normal to use
historical data to determine the cost of debt when valuing companies, he considers that this
methodology is not appropriate in this case.” His reason for considering this is that if market
interest rates are taken in the quadrennium 2007-2010 and inflation in Venezuela during these years
is deducted, the real rates are negative (varying between - 2% and - 11%). In his opinion, negative
rea] rates cannot be maintained over the Jong term, and therefore he considers that the rate of

Ol European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
‘Award

20.65%, calculated by Mr. Kaczmarek, is not realistic. He proposes that it be replaced with a rate
calculated with a different formula, which give a result of 22.41%.

The Tribunal rejects Mr. Guitera’s proposal.

First, because the interest rate that he proposes—22.41%—does not solve the problem that he hopes
to solve: Even if this percentage had been applied, the real rates of interest in the years 2008, 2009
and 2010 would still have been negative (because actual inflation was greater than 22.41%).

And secondly because Mr. Guitera is comparing apples to oranges. His objection is based on
comparing the 20.65% cost of debt proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek with historical inflation in the
quadrennium prior to the expropriation. But that is not the relevant calculation. The proper
comparison is with the inflation forecast in the DCF model. And this amounts to 14%. When this is
compared to a cost of debt of 20.65% it is found that the model incorporates a positive real interest
rate of more than 6%. The problem raised by the expert is not really a problem.”

e. Specific risk premium

Mr. Guitera also adds a 2% specific risk premium to the cost of equity. He justifies its inclusion by
arguing that the Companies are highly dependent on the Polar Group, a single customer which
accounts for more than 70% of sales. This risk would not be reflected by the B or by the country
risk premium.”**

Mr. Kaczmarek disagrees with that approach. He argues, on the one hand, that the Companies were
the largest producer of glass in Venezuela, and, on the other, that the Polar Group was its major
customer and at the same time owned a significant (but minority) stake in the Companies. Because
of that, Ol and Polar were mutually dependent on each other: the Companies could not impose
prices on Polar, because it was their largest customer, and conversely Polar needed them so that it
could obtain containers in the required quantities, because there were no other manufacturers that
could meet the demand.

In short, a hypothetical buyer would view the relationship with Polar—the main customer and
minority a factor that miti rather than the risk. For this reason,
Mr. Kaczmarek is opposed to the inclusion of an additional specific risk premium to cover a
hypothetical risk which in his opinion does not exist, and which is, on the contrary, a positive
factor.

ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

The Tribunal’s Decision

807. The Tribunal considers that on this point Mr. Kaczmarek’s approach is convincing for the following
reasons:

808. First, because of the highly subjective nature of the 2% adjustment proposed by the expert Mr.
Guitera, who recognizes that there is no scientific basis for the calculation:

“I have decided to include in the cost of capital a Specific Company Risk Premium, which I
believe, based on my experience as a Transaction Service Partner, should amount to 2%"””

809. Secondly, because it does not seem likely that a hypothetical buyer would consider the dual
relationship with Polar—the most important customer and a minority shareholder—as a risk factor.
Rather, it seems more likely that a buyer would accept the relationship with the main Venezuelan
food group—a relationship that had already been in existence for many years and which was always
friendly, as a positive factor that would reduce risk and strengthen the stability of the Companies.

810. Third, the relationship between Polar and the Companies has been and still is one of mutual
dependence. The Companies need Polar as a buyer, and Polar has no real option that would allow it to
purchase containers from other manufacturers in the Bolivarian Republic. Strong evidence of this is

seen in what has happened since the expropriation: although Polar too was expropriated, it continues
to purchase most of its containers from the Factories.

D. Market Value

811. Having clarified and settled all discrepancies between the two experts, the Tribunal is now in a
position to calculate the correct discount rate (WACC). In order to do this it is necessary to calculate
the cost of equity and the cost of debt so that they can then be weighted.

Resources owned

812. The cost of equity is obtained by using the CAPM formula:

The values accepted by the Tribunal are the following:
Rf (Risk Free Rate of Return): 18.85%
B: 0.613
EMRP (Equity Market Risk Premium): 6%
CRP (Country Risk Premium): 6%
Inserting the values in the formula gives a cost of equity of 27.92%.
Discount Rate
The cost of the debt and the debt/equity ratio are calculated by Mr. Kaczmarek at 13.63% and 34/66.
The following discount rate results from these figures:
WACC = [27.92 x 0.66] + [13.63 x 0.34]
WACC = 23.06% = 23%
The Tribunal thus concludes that the correct discount rate is 23%.
Market value of the Companies
Once it was calculated that 23% is the appropriate rate for discounting the DCF method for the
Companies, the Tribunal can move on to determining their market value. For this, the Joint Matrix

prepared by both experts, denominated in USD—as this is the currency in which Claimant is
requesting compensation—should be used:

819. The Tribunal has opted for the following solutions:
~ COGS (Cost of Goods Sold): Mr. Kaczmarek”*
— Capex (investments): Mr. Guitera””
— Sales (increase in sales prices): Mr. Kaczmarek*”
— Exports: Mr. Kaczmarek*!

— Discount rate: 23%

820. Adding these values to the Joint Matrix yields USD 487,275,939 as a value for the Companies,
which the Tribunal accepts.

E. Excess Cash

821. It is an established fact that the Bolivarian Republic expropriated not only the Plants, but also all the
funds held in cash and in the banks (“Cash”), which amounted to VEB 151 million. This amount

was very significant and was due to the difficulties encountered by the Companies in repatriating
their profits.*

Experts’ position

Both experts accept that the value of the Companies calculated using the DCF methodology does
not result in the Cash surplus which the companies may be holding unlawfully, far in excess of the
amount required to guarantee their normal operations. It is, therefore, necessary to increase the
value of the Companies by an amount that reflects this surplus. Both experts are also in agreement
on the most suitable methodology to be used in calculating it by

- Defining a sample of similar companies;

- Determining their Cash to Total Assets Ratio;

- Applying this percentage to the assets of the Companies;

- Using this methodology to calculate the required cash level;

the amount over that minimum represents the Cash surplus that must be paid by the Claimant to the
Respondent.

Having agreed on the methodology, the experts are however in disagreement on the company
sample that must be used for comparison purposes.

Mr. Kaczmarek proposes utilizing the same sample of seven similar companies, which he had
already used to calculate B.°* Using this sample, he concludes that the average Cash to Assets Ratio
is 5.1%; applying this percentage to the Companies, he concludes that the required amount of cash
increases to VEB 52 million, which when converted into USD at the exchange rate of 4.3, results in
an amount of USD 23,064,801.

Mr. Guitera is taking a different approach. He is of the opinion that of the seven companies in the
sample, only one is comparable, namely Rigolleau S.A. Therefore, he only uses the Cash to Assets
Ratio of this company as a point of reference, which is 10.5%, and which results in a Cash surplus
of VEB 45 million, which is equivalent to USD 10,562,275.°°

The Tribunal’s Decision
The Tribunal finds that Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculation is appropriate.
Mr. Guitera only chooses one company for comparison and that company is, among the seven in the

sample, the one with the largest Cash holdings. By choosing this company as a comparison, Mr.
Guitera is distorting the result. Mr. Kaczmarek’s method, based on the average amount of Cash held

by the same sample that was already used to calculate the 8 ensures a result that more faithfully
reflects the levels of Cash in entities that are comparable to the Companies.

In summary, the Tribunal decides that the excess in Cash that has been taken away must be added to
the value of the Companies established by the DCF method (USD 487,275,939), totaling USD
23,064,801, thereby resulting in a total value for 100% of the Companies of USD 510,340,740.

Company Specific Discount

There is one last point to be analyzed in order to establish the correct market value of the
Companies: the proposal from the expert, Mr. Guitera that a discount be applied to the Companies
for their specific characteristics.

a. Position of the Experts and the Parties

In his first report, Mr. Guitera introduces the notion that the value of the Companies generated by the
DCF Model should be the cause for a reduction based on a lack of liquidity (“lack of marketability” in
English terminology used by the expert).*” In his opinion, the need to apply such a discount, which he
establishes at 20% is based on two reasons:

- Restrictions on the sale imposed by the OldV and Favianca bylaws, and

- The existence of a series of statutory laws in favor of Polar, which limits the capacity of the
potential buyer to manage the Companies.

The expert recognizes that in this case the discount is not linked to the total valuation of the
Companies, but only to the value of their shares held by OIEG.*”

With regard to the percentage of 20% which he is advocating, the expert explains that pursuant to
the Private Equity Valuation Guidelines, a discount in the range of between 10% and 30% is
appropriate, from which he has selected the middle value.***

Mr. Kaczmarek on his part advises against the application of the discount. He supports this based on
the following major arguments:

é First, he underscores that M&A is intensively involved in the packaging sector; he has
managed to identify 113 transactions during the quinquennium preceding the
expropriation;*” it would be unreasonable to apply a discount for reasons of lack of
liquidity in this sector;

- Secondly, a discount for lack of liquidity would be particularly inappropriate in the case of
Companies which are a part of a group quoted on the Stock Exchange, whose annual
accounts are subject to review and scrutiny and by themselves are significant entities,
which generate significant amounts of cash flow;*"”

- Lastly, he alleges that a discount for a lack of liquidity is not compatible with the market
value standard, which is the one that ought to be used in estimating the cost of the
Companies; the standard presupposes that there is a purchaser ready to purchase and to pay
the market value of the company.*"!

During the hearing, both experts had the opportunity to present their arguments.*!*

In their Closing both parties expounded on their For the Pp the
OldV and Favianca bylaws restrict the possibilities for the sale of OIEG and its management
capacity, and these terms make it difficult to find a purchaser and would also decrease the price.*!
The Claimant, on the other hand, alleges that Polar’s only right would be to block the purchase by
competitive companies in the beverages sector.*!*

b. The Tribunal’s Decision

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant on this point in that in order to determine the market value
of the Companies, which is required under article 6(c) of the Agreement on Encouragement and
Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of
Venezuela, it would not be appropriate to apply a discount for lack of marketability to the value
calculated using the methodology accepted by both experts and based on the DCF.

The expert, Mr. Guitera, asserts that on certain occasions, it may be appropriate to apply a discount
for lack of marketability that reduces the price that must be paid when purchasing equity interest in
a company. In this case, the expert has identified two causes that, in his opinion, justify such a

discount:*'*

- The first consists of the sales restrictions contained in the bylaws of Favianca and OldV, and

— The second consists of the joint management rights granted to Polar under such bylaws.

Ol European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

838. In the expert’s opinion, the restrictions contained in the bylaws would result in a willingness by
all potential buyers’ to only purchase OIEG’s 73% interest in the Companies if a 20% discount
on the standard market price were applied.

839. In order to determine whether the proposal made by the Respondent’s expert is reasonable, the
bylaws of OldV*"* and Favianca®"” must be carefully reviewed. These two documents, while
differing in the manner in which their articles are numbered, govern the causes in question in a
practically identical manner.

Restrictions on Unrestricted Transfer Contained in the Bylaws
840. The bylaws contain two restrictions on the unrestricted transfer of shares:

- The first consists of a prohibition on transfers: OJEG agrees that it will not transfer
Company shares to “any person directly or indirectly involved in any of Polar’s main
lines of business” (including beer, wine, mineral water, non-alcoholic beverages, and oil)
without Polar’s permission.*'*

— The second grants Polar the right of first refusal in the event OIEG decides to relinquish
control over the Companies. This right must be exercised at the same price (“First Price”)
offered by the potential buyer.*”

841. In the opinion of the Tribunal, neither of these two restrictions should significantly affect the
price a third party would be willing to pay for the OIEG block of shares:

— The first should not because, as Mr. Kaczmarek has demonstrated, of the 35 purchase
transactions involving glass companies that took place during the quinquennium prior to
the expropriation, not one involved a purchase by a drink manufacturer. Drink
manufacturers are not natural buyers of glass companies.’

— The second should not because Polar’s right of first refusal is set at the same price as the
price offered by third parties (not at book value or a value set by an auditor); therefore, all
third parties attempting to purchase the OIEG block of shares must at least offer the
market price for such block. Otherwise, Polar (a very strong company) would exercise its
right, purchase OIEG’s equity interest at below-market price, and then either keep it or
resell it at market price and keep the difference. For this reason, Polar’s right of first

Award

refusal would not lead to a price reduction and might, in fact, result in an increase. All
third parties truly interested in purchasing would end up offering a premium on the
market price to decrease Polar’s incentive to exercise the right.

Supermajority Voting Rights

842. Article 29 of OIldV’s and article 32 of Favianca’s bylaws grant Polar certain supermajority
voting rights.”' Both articles state that as long as Polar holds at least 18.49% interest,
resolutions adopted regarding “Fundamental Matters” (which include the matters that already
require a supermajority vote in accordance with article 280 of the Commercial Code as well as
certain financing or related-party transactions) require the consent of both shareholders
(regardless of whether a resolution is adopted by the members of the shareholders’ meeting or
the board of directors).

843.

B

It is the opinion of the Tribunal that a minority shareholder’s being granted these rights under
the bylaws should not significantly affect the price that a third party would be willing to pay for
the OIEG block of shares:

— First, because practically all close corporations with a majority shareholder have
provisions protecting the rights of minority shareholders. All potential purchasers of a
majority interest in a company with minority shareholders would be fully aware that they
could not arbitrarily exercise control.

— Second, because the protection provided by the bylaws to the minority shareholder
simply represent rights already granted by law. The main category of Fundamental
Matters consists of the matters specified in article 280 of the Commercial Code,®” which
is a provision that establishes a supermajority protection for the rights of minority
shareholders.

— Third, because paragraph (c) of articles 29 and 32 of the bylaws includes an escape clause
that allows the majority shareholder to adopt capital increases at a fair price

®2! The references provided by Mr. Guitera are again incorrect.

2 Article 280 of the Commercial Code reads as follows: “When not otherwise provided for in the bylaws, the
number of shareholders representing three-fourths of the capital stock and the favorable vote of those representing at
least one-half of such capital stock must be present at the meeting when addressing the following matters:

. Early dissolution of the company

2. Extending its duration

OI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
‘Award

when they are necessary to keep the Companies competitive.
In_ summary, the Tribunal concludes that the existence in the bylaws of the Companies of the
provisions identified by Mr. Guitera should not cause a significant decrease in the price a third
party would be willing to pay for the OIEG block of shares it holds in the Companies.

An additional reason

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is an additional reason for which in any event the discount
defended by Mr. Guitera makes no sense in this case.

. The discount only makes sense in situations in which a buyer purchases a controlling interest in

(but not 100% of) a company when there is a minority shareholder with supermajority voting rights.
In such cases, the reduction is justified, because the buyer will not be able to freely manage the
company and will need to take into account the minority shareholder’s opinion—if not for all
decisions, then at least for certain important ones.

Ifa buyer purchases 100% of the capital, then there is no logical foundation whatsoever for the
discount. In such a case, the minority shareholder will never be able to have the right of first refusal
or supermajority voting rights. A buyer that purchases 100% of the capital will in any event have to
pay 100% of the market price, with no discount whatsoever, regardless of the bylaws (which in any
case he will be able to modify on the day after the purchase).

Applying these principles to this case, the discount could only have been proposed had Venezuela
only acquired a package of shares that represented 73% of the Companies’ capital. Only in such a
case could it be debated whether the hypothetical buyer should pay 73% of the market value for the
package, or whether it would be appropriate to further discount this price due to the existence of the
right to first refusal or of certain supermajority voting rights in Polar’s favor.

In other words: the application of a discount like the one proposed by Mr. Guitera inevitably
presupposes that the transaction will satisfy two requirements:

- That the buyer purchases a controlling equity interest in a company,

- And that after the purchase, the buyer has to get along in the company with a minority
shareholder who has supermajority voting rights.

Neither of these two requirements is satisfied in this case. The Bolivarian Republic has not

purchased 73% of the Companies’ capital, but rather the Plants and the manufacturing facilities
owned by the Companies and through which they generated their businesses. After the purchase,

OI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

the State does not have to get along with Polar as a minority shareholder, because it did not
purchase shares, and above all, because it also expropriated the part that corresponded to Polar.

In conclusion, and for the aforementioned reasons, the Tribunal decides that Mr. Guitera’s proposal
of applying a discount to the market price of the Companies should not be admitted.

Sanity Checks

The Tribunal has reached the conclusion that the Companies’ market value on the date of
expropriation, calculated using the DCF model developed by the experts, totaled USD 487,275,939.
The excess Cash appropriated by the Bolivarian Republic, which totals USD 23,064,801, must be
added to this amount, resulting in a total value of 100% of the Companies of USD 510,340,740.

Except for the calculation of the excess Cash, this valuation was arrived at through the application
of a DCF methodology—a methodology that must be validated. Making calculations using the DCF
methodology is not a mechanical exercise, and the use of apparently reasonable parameters can lead
to completely irrational results. That is why it is important for the Tribunal to perform this
validation and to reach the conviction that the results are reasonable. To do so, the Tribunal will
perform three verifications:

- First, it will check its own results against the experts’ results (a);

- Then it will calculate the value of the Companies using the EBITDA multiples
methodology (b), and

- Lastly, it will check the value of the Companies in relation to the value of the OI group (c)

a. The experts’ results

In the first attempt at validation, the market value must be compared with the values reached by the
parties’ experts.

The results of the two experts’ valuations could not be any more different: Mr. Kaczmarek values
100% of the Companies at USD 1.004 billion, Mr. Guitera at USD 195 million. The Tribunal has
decided that the correct figure is USD 487 million (not including Cash). The difference between
Mr. Kaczmarek’s value and the Tribunal’s seems to be highly exaggerated, but in fact it is due to
only two factors:

- the capex forecasts; and

OI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

- the application of a discount rate of 23% (and not 20.39%).

The same can be said of Mr. Guitera’s valuation: four factors (the selling price of the products,
price increases, exports, and the rate of 23% instead of 25.78%) would bring his value back into
line with the one established by the Tribunal.

b. Comparable companies

A commonly accepted formula for checking the valuation of a company calculated based on DCF is
to repeat the calculation using the EBITDA multiples method. Essentially, the procedure is as
follows:

- First, a sample is defined of comparable companies for which the EBITDA and market
value are known, and the average multiple that results from dividing the market value by
the EBITDA is calculated;

- When this multiple is known, it is multiplied by the EBITDA of the company that is to be
valued, yielding the value;

= That value is compared with the value obtained through the DCF methodology.

Both experts applied this methodology in order to try to confirm their results—and both came to the
conclusion that they had done so (despite the differences in their valuations). Therefore, it is
imperative for the Tribunal to critically review their calculations.

Determination of the multiple

The first step in any valuation using EBITDA multiples is to define the sample of comparable
companies. The only expert who did so was Mr. Kaczmarek, who created a sample of seven listed
companies that are similar to the Companies (this sample is the same one used in calculating the
unlevered ().** It includes Ol itself, with a multiple of 6.5, and the weighted average of the eight
values yields a multiple of 8.°°°

Mr. Guitera does not agree with that conclusion. Nevertheless, he accepts as a starting point that the
two companies in the sample that are truly comparable, Rigolleau (Argentine) and CIV (Brazilian),
have multiples of 8. However, he considers that the multiple should be reduced to 6.5, since on the
one hand the Argentine and Brazilian economies have better prospects for growth than Venezuela

Award

does, and on the other, because 6.5 is the OI multiple.*”* Finally, he advocates reducing the multiple
to 4 in order to reflect the concentration of risk in Polar.”

. The Tribunal does not share this last assessment made by Mr. Guitera, as it has already expressed

its opinion that the relationship with Polar does not take away from the value of the Companies."

Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that for a company with OIdV’s and Favianca’s characteristics, a
range of EBITDA multiples of between 6.5 and 8 seems reasonable, which is a conclusion that is
consistent with the positions held by the two experts.

The EBITDA of the Companies
The next step consists in establishing the EBITDA of the Companies.
The experts agree that the Companies generated the following EBITDA:
- VEB 244 million in 2008
- VEB 259 million in 2009
- VEB 364 million in 2010
The Companies’ accounting is performed in VEB, and the EBITDA is calculated in that same
currency. However, the experts have discussed whether the EBITDA should be converted to USD
and whether the exchange rate of 2.15 (which was in effect in 2008 and 2009) or of 4.30 (which
was in effect in 2010) should be used. They have also discussed whether the relevant figures
should be the ones from 2009 or the ones from 2010.

The Tribunal’s position is the following:

The calculation should be performed in October 2010, which is when the Companies were
expropriated. What is the EBITDA calculation that a hypothetical buyer could have had then? At
that time, the most recent audited and approved annual accounts would have been the 2009 ones;
for 2010, there would only have been a budget and the data closed at the end of the third quarter.

In general, buyers would tend to use the EBITDA derived from the most recent audited and
approved accounts, since they are the most reliable—that is to say, the 2009 accounts. But in
Venezuela, with its high-inflation economy, this would not be a suitable solution: in October
2010, the 2009 EBITDA figure would already have become outdated, due to inflation.

The experts maintained varied positions on how to solve this problem. In the Tribunal’s opinion,
the most appropriate solution, which hypothetical buyers would have adopted, would be to use

ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

the last figure that was officially approved by the company, the 2009 EBITDA, and adjust it for
the inflation that took place in the first nine months of 2010. The rate of inflation for the year
2010 as a whole reached 28.30%,*” which is approximately equivalent to 21% for the first nine
months. Applying this adjustment, the 2009 EBITDA would go from VEB 259 million to VEB
313 million. In the Tribunal’s opinion, this figure represents a reasonable estimate of the
Companies’ EBITDA in October 2010, as it is based on the last audited and approved EBITDA
but includes adjustments thereto in order to take interim inflation into account.

Taking this EBITDA and applying the minimum and maximum multiples from the range adopted
by the Tribunal gives the following results:

- 6.5 x 313 = 2,035
: 8 x 313 = 2,504

That is to say, the total value of the Companies that is derived from applying the EBITDA
multiples methodology varies from VEB 2,035,000,000 to VEB 2,504,000,000 (depending on the
multiple in the range that is chosen).

How does this result compare with the value calculated using the DCF methodology? This value
is calculated in USD and reaches USD 487,275,939 (not including cash). But in their joint matrix,
the two experts also calculated the value in VEB, using the exchange rate in force on the date of
expropriation.*° The value in VEB is 2,095,286,539, that is to say, in rounded figures, VEB
2,095,000,000.

The Tribunal confirms that the market value of the Companies, calculated using the DCF
methodology, VEB 2,095,000,000, is in line with the calculations made using the EBITDA
multiples methodology:

- Using the multiple of the OI group as a whole (6.5), the result is very similar: VEB 2,095
versus VEB 2,025.

- And applying the multiple 8, which results from the weighted average of comparable
companies, the result is VEB 2,504—compared to which the result of VEB 2,095
obtained with the DCF methodology is 19.5% lower.

The Tribunal therefore confirms that there is a high level of concordance between the results
obtained using the DCF methodology and the EBITDA multiples methodology:

- Using the EBITDA multiple most favorable to the Claimant, the results are identical;

Award

- Using the EBITDA multiple most favorable to the investor, the difference is 19.5% (that
is to say, the price set based on DCF is less than the one derived from the multiples
methodology).

The multiples methodology thus confirms that the DCF calculation is correct overall, but tends to
be conservative and detrimental to the investor.

However, this conservative bias is partially offset by another decision made by the Tribunal, in
which it accepts the claim of excess cash on hand and in banks, and grants the investor an
additional compensation of USD 23,064,801, which is equivalent to VEB 99 million. The total
compensation for 100% of the Companies thus changes from VEB 2,095 (not including cash) to
VEB 2,194,000,000 (including cash)*!—a figure that offsets the conservative bias of the DCF
model and brings the total compensation for 100% of the Companies to a (reasonable, but not
excessive) multiple of just over 7 times EBITDA.*?

« Comparison with the Ol group

A third verification remains to be performed: since the OI group is a company that is listed on the
stock exchange, its market value as of 30 September is known and totals USD 8.595 billion.
Furthermore, the company is obligated by United States stock market regulations to publish a
Form 8-K on a quarterly basis. In this form, the company breaks down how much the Venezuelan
Companies contribute to the group as a whole:** their share represents approximately 3% of
sales, 4% of assets, and 5.7% of the EBITDA®™ of the OI group.*** Therefore, it is possible to
assign the Venezuelan companies an intrinsic value, calculated as a percentage of the value of the
entire group as a whole.

Expert Guitera takes the average of sales, gross profit, and EBIT—an average that equals 4.1%—
as a criterion for comparison, and applies it to the group’s stock market value of USD 8.595
billion. This calculation yields a value for the Venezuelan Companies of USD 352 million.

Although the Tribunal accepts the principle proposed by the east it considers the most
appropriate for ing the value of the V ies within the OI
group as a whole to be the EBITDA and the assets:

 

2 Equivalent to USD 510,340,740.

832

Which is the result of dividing the total price including cash on hand and in banks (2,194) by the adjusted

EBITDA (313), giving a result of 7.01.

®S° Guiterra IL, paragraph 323

® The experts discuss whether this is EBITDA or simply EBIT; for the purposes of the Tribunal’s argument, it is
irrelevant whether the percentage represents one concept or the other.

- According to the Form 8-K, the Venezuelan subsidiaries’ portion of the EBITDA is 5.7%;
applying this to the stock market value of the group as a whole gives a result of USD 490
million.

- The Venezuelan subsidiaries’ share of the group’s assets is 4%, yielding a value of USD 344
million.

The Tribunal estimates the value of the Venezuelan Companies’ share in the Ol group to total
USD 372 million (73% of USD 510 million, including Cash)}—a figure that is within the range of
values derived from the OJ group’s accounting itself (USD 344 million if the assets are used as
the distribution criterion, USD 490 million if the EBITDA is used). The comparison confirms that
the calculation performed by the Tribunal is reasonable.

Final summary

In summary, this Tribunal concludes that the market value of the Companies (calculated by the
Tribunal applying the DCF method developed by both experts) is reasonable and is confirmed by
using alternative methods, such as that of EBITDA multiples or that of the Companies’ equity in
the OI group as a whole. The value of the companies amounts to USD 487,275,939. The excess
Cash of which the companies have been deprived (which amounts to USD 23,064,801) must be
added to this sum. Thus, the total value of 100% of the Companies is USD 510,340,740.

Since Claimant is the owner of a 72.983%** equity interest, it is entitled to compensation in the
amount of USD 372,461,982 for the expropriation of the Companies, including excess Cash.

Additional Damages

In addition to compensation for the value of its participation in the expropriated Companies,
Respondent is claiming additional damages for two reasons**’:

- First, it is claiming the sum of USD 50,566,759 because Respondent made exports to Brazil,
causing damage to Claimant’s business activity in said country;

- Secondly, it is asking for USD 68,030,092 for the disclosure outside of Venezuela and after
the expropriation of proprietary information belonging to the OI group.

Claims for additional damages pose two problems:

- On the one hand, whether Claimant has a right to claim them and

Ol European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

- On the other, whether the damages claimed meet all of the requirements of proof and causality
in order to be awarded.

With respect to the legal aspect, Claimant argues that when Respondent made an expropriation that
does not meet the requirements stipulated in Art. 6 of the BIT, and having incurred other violations
of the Treaty, Claimant is entitled to demand not just the market value of the expropriated goods,
but also compensation for additional damages suffered. In more legal terms, Claimant considers
that it has the right to receive “full compensation” for all of the damages caused by the illegal
actions of the Bolivarian Republic in the broadest terms in which customary international law
interprets this concept.**

Respondent, on the other hand, states its disagreement, and in its opinion Claimant only has a right
to the compensation provided for in Art. 6 of the BIT, that is, the market value of the expropriated
goods, whether or not the expropriation was legal or illegal, in compliance or not with the
requirements stated in said norm.*?

The Tribunal shall invert the order of analysis: it will first study whether the damages claimed by
Claimant have been proven and meet all of the remaining requirements to be recognized; and if it
reaches the conclusion that either one of the two categories complies with these requirements, it
will analyses whether or not the BIT or Customary International Law allows damages to be
awarded.

Damages based on exports to Brazil

In his first report, Mr. Kaczmarek analyzed this reason for the claim and reached the conclusion
that the damages suffered by Claimant total USD 124 million. This amount represents the “potential
damages” that OIEG would suffer in the Brazilian market with the hypothetical association between
Envidrio, the Uruguayan manufacturer of containers, and Venvidrio, the Venezuelan state company
which has taken over the Plants, an association that would presumably lead to the construction of a
joint plant in Brazil.*°

Nevertheless, as the expert himself recognizes in his second report, the construction of a new
factory in Brazil has been postponed, and for this reason, Mr. Kaczmarek has modified the bases for
his calculation of damages. He takes as his starting point that Venvidrio had started to export to
Brazil glass containers manufactured in the expropriated Plants. These exports would represent a
new supplier in the Brazilian glass market, in which OJEG is leader, and could potentially erode its

ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
‘Award

position as such. Without the exports, Claimant would have obtained higher profits than those
actually produced and that would be the base of the damages."

In order to calculate it, the expert has proceeded as follows: starting with the customs information,
he has confirmed that Venvidrio exported 29,165 tons of glass to Brazil from December 2012 to
May 2013. These exports equal 58,330 annualized tons that in turn equal 3.9% of the Brazilian
market.

). Then, the expert calculates the value of 4% of the Brazilian glass market using as a measure the last

purchases and sales made by glass container manufacturing companies in that country. Taking the
average of the price of those transactions, he estimates that the value of 4% of the Brazilian glass
container market is USD 92 million. Given that Claimant has a 55% share of the Brazilian market,
the expert multiplies that percentage” by USD 92 million, and obtains USD 50,566,759—the
amount that Claimant is asking for as compensation.

The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the exports that Venvidrio is making to Brazil may be
eroding the profits that OIEG, the country’s main glass manufacturer, makes, therefore causing it
certain additional damage—damage that would not exist if the Bolivarian Republic had not
expropriated the Companies. However, the Tribunal has already taken this information into account
in the DCF model in that it has accepted the inclusion of export expectations. This inclusion has
had the effect of increasing the market value of the expropriated Companies (ceteris paribus) by
USD 16 million.”

Claimant now hopes to obtain additional compensation for this same reason. Its claim cannot
prosper because neither the existence nor the quantification of the damages supports a critical
analysis:

- Inthe first place, it has not been proven that Venvidrio has obtained 4% of the Brazilian market
for glass containers; the expert simply extrapolates the import data for six months in order to
reach this conclusion, but this manner of proceeding does not convince the Tribunal. The
exports may have been temporary and not maintained over time;

- Inthe second place, the expert hopes to give a value to the 4% share of the Brazilian market
that Respondent would have obtained through his purely commercial import activity by
applying to it the theoretical price that a glass container manufacturing company located in
Brazil would have reached had it had a 4% share of the market—an unjustified equalization of
values;

OI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela

Award

- But even if we accepted that Venvidrio obtained a permanent 4% share of the Brazilian market,
and that the value of that share was USD 92 million (quod non), and also accepting (although it
has not been proven) that OIEG had a 55% share of that market, which is totally impossible to
understand—and Mr. Kaczmarek also does not explain**—that is why Claimant would have
suffered damages equal to 55% of USD 92 million.“*

893. In summary, the Tribunal considers that the effect of the exports that Venvidrio has begun is
already duly included in the DCF model and that Claimant has not been able to demonstrate the
existence of any additional damage for this reason. The burden of proof being on OIEG, the
Tribunal rejects the claim.

B. Damages resulting from Disclosure

894. Claimant is also seeking additional compensation for irregular disclosure of its proprietary
information in the amount of USD 68 million.

895. As per Mr. Kaczmarek’s explanation, Venvidrio made the design of certain ovens, protected by
Claimant’s proprietary information, to a Chinese manufacturer named Luoyang Dayang Refractory
Co, Ltd [“DY”]. This disclosure allegedly caused OIEG damages, which it hopes to recover in this
arbitration.

896. Mr. Kaczmarek recognizes that the damage is difficult to measure, because the effects of the
disclosure are not yet known and these effects will become more important in the future. The
estimation of the damage made by the expert assumes that Venvidrio will use the plans to
manufacture a new oven and that it will be used for exporting to Brazil. With these assumptions, the
expert first calculates that a new oven will represent 5.2% of the Brazilian market.” Applying the
same methodology used in the previous calculation, the expert reaches the conclusion that 5.2% of
the Brazilian market for glass containers has a value of USD 124 million, and applying the 55%
share of the market that OIEG has in that market, the resulting damage is USD 68,030,992."

897. The claim cannot prosper:

- As the Tribunal indicated in its Decision on Provisional Remedies,” it is a fact that the
proprietary information does not belong to Claimant; therefore, Claimant has no standing to
claim those damages;

- It is total speculation that a new oven will be built and that its production will be exported to
Brazil;

- Even if it were to be exported, the calculation of the damages is not convincing for the reasons
given in the previous section.

C. Legal Basis

898. Having proven that the claim for additional damages must be rejected for lack of evidentiary
calculation, Claimant’s claim merits no further consideration.

5. Moral Damages

A. The Parties’ Positions
Claimant’s Position

899. Claimant declares that International Law recognizes that States must compensate for moral
damages, as established in the Articles of the International Law Commission, international
jurisprudence,*® and doctrine.**' It particularly considers relevant the decision in the Desert Line
case, where the tribunal granted moral damages for the harassment and intimidation suffered by the
respondent’s executives at the hands of the State’s Armed Forces.***

900. Therefore, Claimant claims the sum of USD 10 million in moral damages.

Respondent’s Position

901.

Venezuela defends the inadmissibility of the claim for moral damages because the BIT’s “fair
compensation” standard and Venezuelan legislation only authorize OIEG to receive compensation
equal to the market value of its investment.**?

require a “special test,” that the State’s conduct had been contrary to the norms that civilized
nations should abide by and that would have caused grave suffering to the investor.***

Finally, the Respondent argues that an extensive part of the doctrine defends the position that moral
damages cannot be awarded to a company, only to its representatives, since a company does not
suffer the direct damage caused by the State’s abuse.**”

The Analysis of the Tribunal

OIEG claims USD 10 million in compensation for moral damages caused by what it calls
“egregious behavior”** by Respondent during the six months following the expropriation. The
Bolivarian Republic, on the other hand, denies OIEG’s claim with factual and legal arguments."

To solve this matter, the Tribunal will first determine the required standard for the award of
damages (a). Then, it will proceed to analyze if such compensation for damages is appropriate,
given the proven facts (b).

a. Definition of the moral damages standard

The BIT does not make any reference to the possibility that the investor may claim and obtain
compensation for moral damages. Article 6 only provides that it has a right to receive “just
compensation” for the expropriated assets. Nonetheless, such “just compensation” may, under
certain circumstances, include compensation for physical or moral suffering caused by the
Government to the investor. The award entered in Desert Line admitted the possibility that an
arbitral tribunal may grant an investor additional compensation for moral damages, but that was

subject to the exi: of Pp y ” The Lusi shared by the Tribunal,
are the following:*”

“Even if investment treaties primarily aim at protecting property and economic
values, they do not exclude, as such, that a party may, in exceptional
circumstances, ask for compensation for moral damages.”

In Desert Line, the circumstances were truly exceptional. The claimant had suffered physical ill-
treatment and its facilities were besieged by the troops of the Government being sued. The
tribunal, indeed, granted compensation for moral damages.

The question, then, is not whether a Tribunal may or may not grant compensation for moral
damages, because it has been accepted that it has the power to do so as long as exceptional

ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

circumstances exist. The real question is: when do these exceptional situations, which merit the
grant of compensation for moral damages, take place?

In Lemire, the tribunal, after an exhaustive analysis of case law, summarized the status
quaestionis in the following manner:

“Summing up the conclusions which can be drawn from the above case law is
that, as a general rule, moral damages are not available to a party injured by the
wrongful acts of a State, but that moral damages can be awarded in exceptional
cases, provided that

- the State's actions imply physical threat, illegal detention, or other analogous
situations in which the ill-treatment contravenes the norms according to which
civilized nations are expected to act;

- and cause a deterioration of health, stress, anxiety, other mental suffering
such as humiliation, shame and degradation, or loss of reputation, credit and
social position; and

- both cause and effect are grave or substantial.”**!

The Tribunal agrees entirely with the conclusion in Lemire. As a general rule, a party injured by
the wrongful acts of a State cannot be awarded additional compensation for moral damages,
unless it can prove the following:

- that the State’s actions implied physical threat, illegal detention, or other ill-treatments in
contravention of the norms according to which civilized nations are expected to act;

- and that such situation has caused serious damage to its physical health, grave mental
suffering or a substantial loss of reputation.

b. Application of the standard to the facts

Claimant argues that the following facts—which were already reported by Claimant as violations
of the standards of Fair and Equitable Treatment [FET] and of Full Physical Safety and Protection
[PSP]}—amount to “egregious” behavior by Respondent, which should constitute grounds for
granting compensation for moral damages:**

- Respondent allegedly created an omnipresent atmosphere of fear and intimidation in the
Plants;**

- Such threats and intimidation allegedly forced the Companies’ staff to continue working

and to facilitate the transfer of technical processes and know-how;

= Respondent allegedly deployed the Venezuelan National Guard [GNB] for it to
physically take over the Plants and after the expropriation took place, the GNB continued

- Respondent allegedly disclosed overseas the intellectual property used at the Plants;**

- The Temporary Administration Boards have allegedly had, on several occasions,

- The supervising authorities, INPSASEL and INDEPABIS, have allegedly subjected

OldV and Favianca to disproportionate inspections and oversight activities.*®*

Actually, the facts did not exactly occur in the manner and causing the effects described by
Claimant. The Tribunal, after carefully assessing the evidence, has arrived to the following

conclusions:

- The warnings by Minister Menéndez that any deliberate action with the intention of
paralyzing the Plants would be punished did not amount to a threat or cause an

international wrong;**?

2 It was not proved that workers were forced to continue working in the Plants;*”°

- The actions by the GNB at the Plants were not grave enough so as to amount to a

violation of the guarantee of Full Physical Safety and Protection set forth in the BIT."

= Claimant has been unable to prove that it has suffered damages for the alleged disclosure

of the intellectual property used in the Plants.*”

- It has not been proved that the Temporary Administrative Boards showed threatening and

Award

- It has not been proved that the actions by INPSASEL constituted a violation of the
standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment.'

- The inspections conducted by INPSASEL and INDEPABIS, even though detailed and
probably excessive, did not constitute an ill-treatment of Claimant, neither did it cause
distress to Claimant or damage to its reputation.*”*

Therefore, Claimant has not succeeded at proving that the behavior of the Republic during the
transition period has given rise to a violation of the standards of Full Physical Safety and
Protection and of Fair and Equitable Treatment (except for the occupation of the Plants by
INDEPABIS, which was arbitrary and constituted a violation of the standard of Fair and
Equitable Treatment, as will be analyzed in the following paragraph). The Full Physical Safety
and Protection and Fair and Equitable Treatment standards have fewer requirements than those
necessary in order to grant moral damages compensation. Since the behavior reported by
Claimant could not be qualified as international wrongs, it follows that it may not constitute
grounds for awarding compensation for moral damages.

Now we shall address the actions by INDEPABIS. The Tribunal has already concluded that
INDEPABIS acted arbitrarily and there was a misuse of power, contrary to the Fair and Equitable
Treatment standard required in Article 3(1) of the BIT.

Is this behavior worthy of an additional compensation for moral damages?

The Tribunal concludes that the answer to the question above is negative. Claimant failed to
prove that the irregular behavior by INDEPABIS amounted to physical threats, illegal detention
or ill-treatment. In addition, it has not been alleged or proved that INDEPABIS behavior caused
harm to the health or stress or anxiety, or any other kind of psychological suffering such as
humiliation, shame, degradation, or loss of reputation, standing or social position to Claimant or
its legal representatives. Therefore, it does not meet the necessary requirements for awarding
additional compensation for moral damages.

eK

In_summary, the Tribunal denies the Claimant’s request to order the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela to pay compensation for moral damages, because it has not been proven that
Respondent’s behavior was sufficiently grave and unlawful for this Tribunal to grant such an
exceptional measure as additional compensation for moral damages.

6. Interest

918. The parties disagree on the accrual start date, the applicable interest rate and the calculation
method.

A.  Claimant’s Position

919. In order to be completely compensated for damages suffered, including damages caused by the
delay in the payment of full compensation,*” Claimant claims the payment of interest based on Art.
6(c) of the BIT.°”

920. The expert for Claimant proposes three commercial interest rates which he considers reasonable.*”*

- The yield of USD-denominated Venezuelan sovereign bonds;*”

- The rate offered on the London interbank market (LIBOR) + 4%;**°

- The US. prime rate + 2%."

921. Claimant requests that interest be accrued between 26 October 2010 and the payment date, and of
the three alternatives described by the expert, it chooses the application of the LIBOR plus a margin
of 4%, with no distinction being made between pre and post-award interest,*** except in reference to
capitalization.*

922. With respect to the calculation method, the investor advocates what it calls “compound interest”
because it represents—from its point of view-—the most precise way to guarantee full
compensation. Concretely, it requests that interest accrued prior to the award be capitalized
yearly and interest accrued after the award be capitalized yearly or half-yearly (whichever amount
is greater).***

B. Respondent’s Position

923. Respondent rejects that Claimant’s calculation of the interest is correct because the calculation start
date is incorrect and the rates proposed are inappropriate. Furthermore, it opposes Claimant’s

924. Respondent maintains that it should not have to pay interest prior to the award and bases its
argument on the Venezuelan Civil Code. Alternatively, it argues that if said interest is awarded,
they should be calculated as of the date of the Request for Arbitration, 2 September 2011, and not
as of the date of expropriation.**”

925. The Republic rejects the three interest rates proposed by Claimant’s expert, arguing that they are
applicable for borrowers but not for investors.** Therefore, it requests that the following be
applied:

-  arisk-free rate, such as six-month United States Government Treasury Bonds (0.2%**); or

- alternatively, the average of OI’s short-term debt for the period ending 30 September 2010,
that is, 2.76%."

926. With respect to the interest calculation method, Venezuela opposes the use of “compound
interest*' because Venezuelan law does not allow it except as otherwise agreed.*” Subsidiarily,
Respondent requests that if the Tribunal grants compound interest, it be capitalized yearly."**

c The Analysis of the Tribunal

927. Article 6 of the BIT contains some regulations regarding the calculation and accrual of interest. It
provides that compensation for expropriation

“shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment.”

928. Based on this provision as a starting point and supplementing it with the general principles of
International Law, this Tribunal must determine all of the elements involved in the calculation of
interest:

- the accrual start date;
- the accrual end date;

- the interest rate;

- and the calculation method.

Respondent seeks to apply Venezuelan Civil Code regulations on this matter; this Tribunal does
not agree with this view because the main obligation on which interest must be applied is not
subject to Venezuelan legislation but to the BIT, an international treaty, and is therefore governed
by International Law.

Accrual start date
The parties disagree as to the date of commencement of interest accrual.

Claimant proposes the expropriation date, 26 October 2010, while Respondent suggests the date of
the award or, alternatively, the date of the request for arbitration, i.e. 2 September 2011.

Damages are owed since the moment of the expropriation (26 October 2010) and so this must be
the date in which interest starts to accrue. Until that date, Claimant benefitted from the product of
its investment and since that date, it must receive the interest accrued on compensation.

The Tribunal finds no justification to postpone interest accrual until the date of the request for
arbitration, much less until the date of the award.

Accrual end date

This shall be the date of effective payment of full compensation by the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela.

Interest rate

The Netherlands-Venezuela BIT provides that compensation for expropriation “shall include
interest at a normal commercial rate.”** Nevertheless, it does not specify the interest rate; as a
result, this Tribunal must determine the interest rate at its discretion.

Venezuela proposes to apply the median interest rate on the short-term debt incurred by OI for the
period that ended on 30 September 2010 or the six-month U.S. Treasury Bills rate.

The Tribunal does not agree with Respondent.

The rate of interest on the compensation for expropriation, owed since 2010, must be that of a
long-term debt. In addition, the United States’ credit risk is among the lowest in the market;
applying its interest rate to a debt owed by the Bolivarian Republic would lead to unreasonable
financial results.

OI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

The expert for Claimant has evaluated the possibility of applying one of the three following
alternatives to compute the proper interest rate:

- the yield of USD-denominated Venezuelan sovereign bonds;*”*

- LIBOR plus 4%;°*

- or the U.S. prime rate plus 2%.*”

However, in its final petition, Claimant did not leave the choice among the three alternatives to the
Tribunal but specified that it requested that the Tribunal apply a LIBOR-based interest rate plus a
4% margin.

This Tribunal hereby grants Claimant's request.

LIBOR is the interest rate used in the London interbank market and it is set by the British Bankers’
Association on a daily basis for interbank deposits at various terms and in various currencies. It is
universally accepted as a benchmark to set interest rates for loans, deposits and other financial
instruments. In financial practice, bank loans to customers accrue interest at LIBOR plus a margin.

In the instant case, the Tribunal is inclined to apply the LIBOR rate for one-year deposits plus the
surcharge that would be applied to a company similar to Claimant for a loan in the market.

Claimant proposes that the margin be 4% and this Tribunal confirms that a recent arbitral award
accepted such figure.* A LIBOR rate for one-year deposits plus 4% is a “normal commercial
rate” that guarantees full compensation to Claimant.

The initial LIBOR rate will be the rate published on the accrual start date for one-year deposits; it
will be applied for the following year and be recalculated annually.

Calculation method

Claimant has requested “compound interest.” What Claimant means by this equivocal term is that
each year, unpaid accrued interest should be accumulated to the principal (or even every six
months after the issuance of the award, if this were more favorable to Claimant), generating in turn
interest over the following periods. Respondent opposes this request and considers that

ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
Award

capitalization is not admissible; in the alternative, Respondent requests that, if allowed, interest be
calculated annually.

As a threshold matter and in order to dissipate any doubt as to the equivocal concept of
“compound interest,” the Tribunal confirms that both parties agree that interest must be calculated
according to the simple interest formula (and not by the compound interest formula or anatocism
[(. +"), as is common practice in all financial transactions based on LIBOR.

In fact, the matter at issue is whether interest must be periodically accumulated to the principal and
from that point on accrue further interest as part of the principal amount. This question has been
analyzed in several investment-related awards and, although the traditional view has been rather
reticent to accept it, the most recent trend is to accept yearly or half-yearly capitalization.”

This Tribunal shares the view stated in the most recent decisions because in a LIBOR-based
interest calculation, capitalization is financially essential in order to wholly compensate the
investor.

Indeed, the purpose of interest is to compensate for the external financial cost that Claimant would
hypothetically incur to cover the loss caused by the delay in the payment of damages. If Claimant
had obtained a one-year LIBOR loan on normal market conditions, it would have had to pay
interest annually from the accrual start date; failure to do so would have caused interest to
accumulate to the principal amount, thus accruing further interest from that moment on. Thus, in
order to maintain Claimant fully indemnified, the award needs to allow for annual capitalization of
interest.

Specifically, Claimant requests that interest prior to the award be capitalized yearly and interest
after the award be capitalized half-yearly or yearly (whichever amount is greater). This Tribunal
finds no reason why any such distinction should be made: there is no reason that justifies making a
difference between the periods before and after the award. In addition, half-yearly capitalization
would require the six-month deposit and the one-year deposit LIBOR rates to be applied
depending on the capitalization period, which would introduce unnecessary complexity to the
calculation.

Therefore, the Tribunal hereby decides that interest shall be capitalized yearly in arrears, on the
same date that the LIBOR rate for one-year deposits is recalculated.

In summary, this Tribunal hereby decides that from 26 October 2010 until the date of payment,
the principal amount of USD 372,461,982 will accrue interest at the LIBOR rate for one-year
deposits in USD plus 4% and such interest will be capitalized on a yearly basis.
COSTS

Regulation 47(1)(j) of the Arbitration Rules establishes that “the award must be in writing and
must involve [...] the Tribunal’s decision on costs pertaining to legal processes.”

The Tribunal requested that the parties provide details on the amounts being claimed under the
costs item. The petitions of the parties are reproduced in the following paragraphs. The Tribunal
places on record that neither the matters being counter-argued, nor the veracity of the figures
have been questioned by any of them.

Venezuela would not have violated the BIT.”"° Therefore, it is requesting that the Claimant be
ordered to pay all the costs of this Arbitration.”"!

“the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses
incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and
by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and
the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.”

963. Neither the ICSID Convention nor the Arbitration Rules contain any guidelines whatsoever in
connection with the apportionment of costs. Therefore, this Tribunal has the discretion to decide
how they will be apportioned.

964. This Tribunal looks favorably upon the new trend in investment arbitration by which costs are
awarded in a manner that reflects to a certain extent the principle that the losing party is to make a
significant contribution to the payment of the arbitration fees, costs and expenses incurred by the
prevailing party.”””

965. Both parties request that this Tribunal impose on their adversary the full amount of the costs
arising from this arbitration. Respondent bases its petition for costs on the assertion that
Claimant’s claims were made arbitrarily as it failed to meet the necessary jurisdictional
requirements, and alternatively alleges that OIEG has grossly inflated the value of its equity in the
Companies.

ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25
‘Award

This Tribunal has already determined that Claimant is to be regarded as an investor inasmuch as it
holds an investment protected by the BIT.” Further, the Tribunal has concluded that Claimant
was a victim of unlawful expropriation by Venezuela and was subjected to unfair and unequal
treatment. Finally, this Tribunal has determined that Venezuela must pay damages to Claimant in
the amount of USD 372,461,982 as a consequence of the expropriation.

Most of Claimant’s requests have therefore been granted. For this reason, Respondent shall bear,
not all, but part of, Claimant's costs.

In apportioning arbitration costs, this Tribunal will consider two large categories of requested
costs:

- The provision of funds paid to ICSID. These are known as the costs of the proceedings
[the “Costs of the Proceedings” ];

- The expenses incurred to pay for the parties’ defense [the “Defense Expenses”).

Costs of the proceedings

This Tribunal finds that Claimant has prevailed, not entirely, but to a great extent, in these
proceedings: the Tribunal confirmed its jurisdiction over all the claims, it determined three of the
five breaches of the BIT alleged by Claimant and it awarded 40% of the requested damages.

For this reason, this Tribunal finds that Respondent must bear the Costs of the Proceedings. In
other words, Respondent shall reimburse Claimant for a total of USD 500,000.

Defense Expenses

The Defense Expenses requested by Claimant are of a widely varied nature as they are concerned
with attorneys, experts and witnesses, among other elements. In the view of this Tribunal,
Respondent cannot be made to bear all the expenses incurred by Claimant, without limitations.
Respondent shall only bear the Defense Expenses actually incurred by Claimant that are
indispensable to adequately defend its interests [Reasonable Defense Expenses”]. Taking into
account the complexity of the case, the amounts in dispute and the work performed by the
attorneys and the experts, this Tribunal has determined that the amount of the Reasonable
Defense Expenses is USD 6,000,000 for attorneys and USD 1,500,000 for experts.

Award

la’s Contribution to the Defense Expenses
This Tribunal must determine the portion of the Reasonable Defense Expenses to be borne by
Respondent based on the time on which they are to become payable by Claimant.

The arbitration process has been divided into three large stages: jurisdiction, liability and
damages. In order to determine the apportionment of the costs, the Tribunal will assume that
Claimant’s Reasonable Defense Expenses have been divided as follows during these stages:

= one third of the attorneys’ fees and expenses at each of said stages;
SI and the total amount of the experts’ fees and expenses during the damages stage.
Consequently:

- During the jurisdiction stage, all the jurisdictional objections made by Venezuela were
dismissed. Therefore, Claimant prevailed entirely and is to be reimbursed for the total
amount of its Reasonable Defense Expenses at this stage: USD 2,000,000

- During the liability stage, this Tribunal granted three of the five claims made by
Claimant: expropriation, unfair and unequal treatment, and breach of the Umbrella
Clause; the Tribunal holds that Venezuela must pay 75% of the Reasonable Defense
Expenses incurred at the liability stage: USD 1,500,000.

- During the damages stage, Claimant claimed USD 929,544,714." This Tribunal has
determined that the amount of damages owed to Claimant as a consequence of the
expropriation is USD 372,461,982.”'* This Tribunal holds that Venezuela must pay 50%
of Claimant’s Reasonable Defense Expenses incurred at the Damages stage: that is to say,
USD 1,000,000 for attorneys’ fees and expenses and USD 750,000 for experts’ fees and
expenses.

The total amount owed to Claimant by Venezuela for Reasonable Defense Expenses is USD
5,250,000.

In conclusion, Venezuela shall pay USD 5,750,000 for the costs involved in this arbitration. In
addition, Claimant has requested that interest be accrued on said amount. This request is hereby
granted by this Tribunal, to which end the accrual start date shall be the day on which this award
is issued; and the accrual end date, the interest rate and the method of calculation shall be those
established in Section 6 of this Chapter.”'®

Vit SUMMARY

In its written summary of conclusions, Plaintiff asked the Tribunal to:

“(1) order that Defendant’s preliminary objections be rejected in their entirety;

(2) declare that Defendant has breached the Bilateral Investment Treaty, including articles
3(1), 3(2), 3(4), 5, and 6;

(3) order Defendant to pay damages to Plaintiff in the amount of no less than USD
929,544,714, including:

a. USD 729,821,323 for the expropriation of Plaintiff's economic interests in the
Companies;

b. USD 16,833,383 for the expropriation of Plaintiff's share of the excess cash in the bank
accounts of OIdV and Favianca;

c. USD 54,292,257 for the loss of revenue caused by Defendant’s wrongful interference
with the repatriation of Plaintiff's dividends paid by OldV and Favianca;

d. USD 50,566,759 for indirect damages caused by the use of property wrongfully
expropriated by Defendant to cause harm to Plaintiff's business outside Venezuela;

e. USD 68,030,992 for indirect damages caused by the dissemination outside Venezuela,
and as a consequence of the expropriation of the Plants, of the intellectual property of OI
and other confidential processes and information by Defendant;

f. USD 10,000,000 for moral damages caused by Defendant’s egregious conduct during the
six months following the expropriation;

(4) order Defendant to pay interest compounded on the amount that the Tribunal awards to
Plaintiff for damages at an interest rate of LIBOR +4%; that amount must be compounded
annually from the date of expropriation until the date of the award, and compounded annually
or every six months (whichever is greater) from the date of the award until the date when the
payment in United States dollars is received by Plaintiff in funds available immediately in a
bank account outside Venezuela, designated by Plaintiff for this purpose;

(5) order Defendant to pay all of Plaintiff's arbitration costs, which include but are not

(6) if the Tribunal does not order Defendant to pay all of Plaintiff's arbitration expenses,
order Defendant to pay all of Plaintiff's expenses in connection with the preliminary
objections and the bifurcation request, which include but are not limited to all of the expenses
and fees of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes and the Tribunal,
and all the legal expenses and costs incurred by Plaintiff (which include but are not limited to
attorney fees and expenses), with interest calculated in accordance with paragraph (4) above;
and

(7) order any other additional compensation that the Tribunal considers appropriate.”

With regard to its first claim, the Tribunal has rejected the defenses of lack of jurisdiction raised
by Defendant and holds that the Centre has jurisdiction and the Tribunal itself has jurisdiction to
hear all the issues raised in this proceeding and rule on the substance of the dispute.

With regard to its second claim, the Tribunal has ruled that the Republic of Venezuela has
breached articles 6, 3(1), and 3(4) of the Venezuela-Netherlands Reciprocal Investment
Protection Agreement. However, it has dismissed Plaintiff's request to declare that Venezuela has
breached articles 3(2) and 5 of the Reciprocal Investment Protection Agreement.

The Tribunal has resolved Plaintiff's requests for damages as follows:

- Plaintiff requested USD 729,821,323 for the expropriation of its economic interests in the
Companies; the Tribunal holds that the value of OIEG’s interest in the Companies
amounts to USD 355,628,599;

- Plaintiff requested USD 16,833,383 for the expropriation of surplus cash in the bank
accounts of OIdV and Favianca, and the Tribunal fully grants the request;

- the Tribunal entirely rejects Plaintiff's remaining claims for damages.

Therefore, of the USD 929,544,714 requested by Plaintiff for damages, the Tribunal has awarded
USD 372,461,982 as compensation for the expropriation of Plaintiff's interest in the Companies
and its share in the surplus cash in the bank accounts of OldV and Favianca.

With regard to Plaintiff's request for interest, the Tribunal holds that Defendant must pay interest
on USD 372,461,982 at an interest rate of LIBOR +4% for one-year deposits in US dollars; the
interest must be compounded annually, accrued from the date of expropriation until the date when
the payment in US dollars is received by Plaintiff in funds immediately available in a bank
account outside Venezuela, designated by Plaintiff.

interest from the date of this award until the date when the payment in US dollars is received by
Plaintiff, at an interest rate of LIBOR +4%; the interest must be compounded annually. That
amount includes the payment of all costs incurred by Plaintiff in its defense in connection with
