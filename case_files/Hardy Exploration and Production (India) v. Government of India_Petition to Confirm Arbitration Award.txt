Respondent.

 

 

Petitioner Hardy Exploration & Production (India), Inc. (“HEPI”), a Delaware
corporation, by and through its attorneys, Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP, pursuant to the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 207, seeks to confirm the entirety of the arbitration award rendered
by an arbitral tribunal in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on February 2, 2013 (the “Award”), and in
support thereof alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. Petitioner HEPI is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of
Delaware.
2. Respondent is the Government of India (“GOI” or “Government”), acting through

its Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (“Ministry”).

Case 1:16-cv-00140-RC Document1 Filed 01/28/16 Page 2 of 6

3. This Court has original jurisdiction over this proceeding under 28 U.S.C.

§ 1330(a) and 9 U.S.C. § 203, in that the subject matter of this proceeding relates to an
arbitration award falling under the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, June 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T. 2517, 330 U.N.T.S. 38 (the
“Convention”), implemented at 9 U.S.C. § 201 et seg. Because this proceeding is an action to
confirm an award under 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6), Respondent is not exempt from the court’s
jurisdiction on sovereign immunity grounds.

4. Venue is proper in this jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(f)(4).

Facts!

5. The Award resolved a dispute between the parties arising under HEPI’s
participation in a Production Sharing Contract (“PSC”) with the Government of India. The PSC
involves the exploration of an off-shore block called CY-OS/2 (the “Block”), located in the
Cauvery Basin off of India’s south-eastern shore, for hydrocarbon resources. A true and correct
certified copy of the PSC is attached as Exhibit 2 to the Declaration of Ian MacKenzie dated
January 27, 2016.

6. The PSC was originally entered into on November 19, 1996 between the
“President of India, acting through the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas”
(referred throughout the agreement as the “Government”), India’s state-owned oil exploration
and production company, and three private companies. The PSC sets forth in detail, among other

things, the rights and obligations of the parties vis-a-vis various phases of exploration,

1. These facts are set forth in greater detail in Petitioner’s concurrently filed Memorandum of Law in Support of
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award and Declaration of lan MacKenzie.

Case 1:16-cv-00140-RC Document1 Filed 01/28/16 Page 3 of 6

procedures in the event of commercial discovery, as well the terms of any commercial
development and sale of hydrocarbons extracted from the Block. The PSC provides for the
arbitration of any disputes arising under the contract. It provides that the place of the arbitration
would be Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

7. Although HEPI was not amongst the companies which originally entered into the
PSC with the GOI, it first acquired an interest in the Block in 1997, and held a 75% interest share
at all relevant times to the underlying dispute.

8. After significant expense and investment in the project and several years of
exploration work, HEPI eventually made a discovery of natural gas. Under the PSC, the nature
of the discovery permitted HEPI a five-year period to appraise the discovery for commercial
viability. The Government, however, arbitrarily and unilaterally decided that the discovery was
in fact crude oil and subject to a two-year appraisal period. On the basis of this decision, it
illegally revoked HEPI’s interests under the PSC.

9. Unable to resolve the dispute amicably, HEPI commenced arbitration proceedings
pursuant to the terms of Article 33 of the PSC and nominated the Honorable Mr. Justice V.N.
Khare to serve as a party-appointed arbitrator. In response, the Government nominated the
Honorable Mr. Justice G.B. Patnaik, and the two party-appointed arbitrators nominated the
Honorable Mr. Justice S.P. Bharucha to serve as the presiding arbitrator. All three members of
this Tribunal are former Chief Justices of the Supreme Court of India.

10. After the Tribunal was duly constituted, a preliminary hearing was held on
August 27, 2010 and the parties submitted their pleadings and evidence thereafter. At the

Government’s request, the Tribunal first considered preliminary questions to establish whether

Case 1:16-cv-00140-RC Document1 Filed 01/28/16 Page 4 of 6

the dispute itself was arbitrable and properly within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. These questions
were resolved unanimously in favor of HEPI in a reasoned order issued on May 28, 2011.

11. In the course of the proceedings, both parties also presented witnesses who were
subject to cross-examination. HEPI presented two expert witnesses to support its argument that
the discovery at the Block was natural gas, not crude oil; the Government did not produce any
expert testimony to the contrary. Arguments were heard before the Tribunal on August 20-22,
2012 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

12. On February 2, 2013, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the Tribunal issued a
unanimous 43-page Award deciding in HEPI’s favor. A true and correct certified copy of the
Award is attached as Exhibit 1 to the Declaration of Ian MacKenzie dated January 27, 2016.
With respect to the key issue, the Tribunal concluded that “the nature of the discovery in the
Block CY-OS/2 would unequivocally qualify under the term of the [PSC] as Non Associated
Natural Gas.” The Tribunal also found that HEPI was erroneously “denied the time provided for
in the contract for appraisal and to come to the conclusion about the commerciality of the
discovery.” As a result, the Tribunal deemed the forced relinquishment of HEPI’s interest in the
Block illegal. To remedy the Government’s unlawful conduct, the Tribunal declared the
relinquishment null and void, ordered HEPI’s interest in the Block to be restored, and granted
HEPI three years from the date of restoration to continue an appraisal of commerciality subject
to the PSC’s requirements.

13. The Tribunal also ordered compensation to be paid to HEPI for the unlawful
deprivation of its rights. Compensation was determined based on the application of a running

formula in relation to the amount HEPI invested in the project and the duration of time that HEPI

Case 1:16-cv-00140-RC Document1 Filed 01/28/16 Page 5 of 6

remains deprived of its interest in the Block.” The Tribunal further ordered the Government to
pay apportioned costs of the arbitration.

14. The Award represents a complete and final determination of all claims submitted
by the parties to the Tribunal. Less than three years has expired since the date of delivery of the
Award by the tribunal to the parties, and the Award has not been vacated or modified since
issued. Indeed, the Government has never challenged the Award in Malaysia, the sole
jurisdiction with authority to vacate the Award.

15. On or about July 19, 2013, the Government filed a petition in Delhi High Court
attempting to nullify the Award. On November 27, 2013, HEPI also filed a petition to enforce
the Award in Delhi High Court. After the submission of both parties’ pleadings and a number of
procedural delays, the Government’s petition was dismissed by the Delhi High Court on July 9,
2015. The Government subsequently filed a review appeal of that dismissal but this too was
rejected by the Delhi High Court on January 20, 2016. The Delhi High Court has not ruled on
HEPI’s petition to enforce the Award in India.

WHEREFORE, Petitioner HEPI respectfully requests that the Court enter an order,
pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 207, (i) confirming the Award in its entirety, (ii) directing that judgment
be entered confirming the Award, as well as (iii) such other and further relief as the Court deems

just and proper.

2. During the arbitration, the amount invested to date by HEPI was established at Rs. 500 crores (Rs 1 crores
equals Rs 10,000,000). Based on the current Rs/USD exchange rate, which HEPI reserves the right to update
after confirmation of the Award, this amount would translate into approximately $74 million.
