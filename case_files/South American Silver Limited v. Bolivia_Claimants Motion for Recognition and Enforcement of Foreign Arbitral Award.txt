IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

SOUTH AMERICAN SILVER LIMITED (BERMUDA)

Plaintiff,
v. : Case No.
THE PLURINATIONAL STATE OF BOLIVIA

Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR THE
RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF
INTERNATIONAL ARBITRAL AWARD

Complaint Summary

Plaintiff South American Silver Limited (Bermuda) (“SASL”) seeks by this Complaint
the recognition and enforcement of a late-2018 international arbitration award for the
expropriation by Bolivia of certain SASL mining operations. The arbitration panel convened by
the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, Netherlands awarded SASL $18.7 million plus
compound interest.

This Court has secondary jurisdiction over the arbitral award. That is, this Court does not
review the merits of the award, but upon demonstration of subject matter and personal
jurisdiction may rely on the certified copy of the arbitral award to enter judgment.

SASL pursues a judgment from this Court under plenary proceedings as directed in Teco
Guatemala Holdings, LLC v. Republic of Guatemala, 2018 WL 470594 (D.C. Cir. 2018).

Personal jurisdiction over defendant Bolivia is through the “arbitration exception” in the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (“FSIA”), 28 USC §§ 1605(a)(1). This Court has subject

matter jurisdiction pursuant under these provisions when coupled with legally sufficient service

and proper venue. See Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 863 F.3d
96 (2"4 Cir. 2017).
Certified copies of the Treaty and the Arbitration Opinion/Decision are attached and

made part of this Complaint.

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff South American Silver Limited (Bermuda) (“SASL”) is a Bermuda
corporation with its principal offices in Hamilton, Bermuda.

2. Defendant is the Plurinational State of Bolivia (“Bolivia’). The Embassy of
Bolivia is at 3014 Massachusetts Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, and the Consulate
General of Bolivia is at 1825 Connecticut Ave., N.W. Washington, D.C. 20009.

3. Bolivia is a “foreign state” for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act
(“FSIA”), 28 USC § 1603.

4. SASL initiated an arbitration in April 2013 against Bolivia (PCA Case No. 2013-
15). SASL sought compensation for the expropriation of certain SASL’s mining operations in
Bolivia.

THE ARBITRATION

5. Pursuant to the terms of the 1988 Agreement Between the Government of the
United Kingdom and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Bolivia for the
Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed by both the United Kingdom and Bolivia (the
Agreement is referred to herein as the “Treaty”), SASL could pursue it claims against Bolivia in
arbitration. The Treaty was extended in 1992 to include Bermuda as a U.K. territory. A certified

copy of the Treaty is attached as Exhibit 1.

Case 1:19-cv-00540 Document1 Filed 02/28/19 Page 3 of 7

6. The Treaty provides in Article 8 Part (1) the agreement that “Disputes between an
Investor and a Host State ... shall be submitted to international arbitration if either party to the
dispute so wishes.” SASL is an “Investor” and Bolivia is the “Host State.”

7. SASL complied with Treaty terms and at the appropriate time requested
arbitration. The arbitration was before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague,
Netherlands. The arbitration was conducted under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

8. The arbitral decision was announced in late 2018. The decision awarded SASL
$18,700,000.00 (US) plus compound interest to the date of payment of the award. The interest
rate is that established by the Central Bank of Bolivia as of August 12, 2012. See { 17 below.

JURISDICTION and VENUE
9. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (“FSIA”), 28 USC §§ 1330, 1332,
1391(f), 1441(d), and 1602-1611, applies to this matter. Section 1605 of the FSIA provides:
General exceptions to the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign state

(a) A foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United
States or of the States in any case—

(1) in which the foreign state has waived its immunity either explicitly or by
implication, notwithstanding any withdrawal of the waiver which the foreign state
may purport to effect except in accordance with the terms of the waiver; or

10. Under the FSIA, federal courts are empowered to exercise personal jurisdiction
over a foreign sovereign when two conditions are met: (1) an exception from jurisdictional
immunity established by the FSIA (see {9 above) applies, and (2) the sovereign has been served
with process in accordance with the FSIA’s provisions. See 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b); Shapiro v.

Republic of Bolivia, 930 F.2d 1013, 1020 (2d Cir. 1991) (“Under the FSIA ... personal

jurisdiction [over a foreign sovereign] equals subject matter jurisdiction plus valid service of
process.”). The procedural requirements are set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1608 (“Service; time to
answer; default”), and the venue requirements are set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f) ( “Civil
actions against a foreign state”).

11. SASL is serving Bolivia as required under 28 USC §§ 1330(b) and 1608(a).

12. — Venue is proper in the District of Columbia under 28 USC § 1391(f)(4).

RELEVANT FACTS

13. SASL invested in mining operations in Bolivia. Bolivia expropriated the SASL
operations in 2012.

14. SASL sought compensation under the Treaty.

15. When the parties were unable to reach agreement, SASL initiated an international
arbitration in the Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) in The Hague, Netherlands. The
Treaty provides for international arbitration.

16. Following protracted proceedings, the PCA issued a 265-page written opinion in
October 2018. A copy of the Arbitration Opinion is attached at Exhibits 2 and 3 (to submit in
attachments of less than 1OMB, the full Opinion is filed in two segments, Exhibit 2 and Exhibit
3; a separate Opinion is attached as Exhibit 4). The Decision is found at page 264, {[ 938 of the
opinion. Beginning in subparagraph (a) of {| 938, the tribunal decided it has jurisdiction. Then,
in subparagraph (b), the Decision states that Bolivia breached the requirement to provide SASL
compensation. Bolivia is then ordered, in subparagraph (g), to pay “US$18.7 million” to SASL.
Additionally, under subparagraph (h), Bolivia is to pay compound interest from the date of the

award at the rate established by the Central Bank of Bolivia as of August 12, 2012.
