PROCEDURE

A. PROCEDURE LEADING TO THE DECISION ON JURISDICTION
By notice dated April 25, 2003, National Grid Transco plc' (hereinafter “National
Grid” or the “Claimant”) requested the institution of an arbitration proceeding
against the Argentine Republic (hereinafter “the Argentine Republic” or the
“Respondent”) under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law (hereinafter the “UNCITRAL Rules”) pursuant to the
Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the Government of the Argentine Republic for the
Promotion and Protection of Investments, which was signed on December 11,
1990 and entered into force on February 19, 1993 (the “Treaty”).
The Claimant and the Respondent appointed as arbitrators Mr. Eli Whitney
Debevoise and Professor Alejandro Garro, respectively. In accordance with
Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the party-appointed arbitrators selected Dr.
Andrés Rigo Sureda as the third arbitrator and President of the Tribunal.
On June 20, 2006, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Jurisdiction, which is made
part of this Award, dismissing the objections to jurisdiction submitted by the
Respondent. The procedural history in the present case up to that date was

indicated in paragraphs 1 through 31 of the Decision on Jurisdiction.

By letter of August 19, 2005, the Claimant informed the Tribunal of its change of name from National
Grid Transco plc to National Grid plc.

B. PROCEDURE LEADING TO THE AWARD ON THE MERITS

1. Scheduling of submissions
On June 20, 2006, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 for the

continuation of the proceedings on the merits, ratifying the deadlines established
in Procedural Order No. 2 of July 12, 2004, which had been agreed during the
Preparatory Meeting of June 25, 2004.

By letter of July 24, 2006, the Respondent informed the Tribunal about the
Parties’ agreement concerning the continuation of the proceeding, which was
confirmed by the Claimant by letter of July 24, 2006.

On August 31, 2006, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 concerning the
Parties’ remaining pleadings on the merits and other changes agreed by the
Parties for the computation of deadlines. The Tribunal further decided, after
consultation with the Parties, to establish July 9, 2007 as the starting date of the
hearing on the merits.

On September 25, 2006, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the
merits in Spanish. The English translation followed on October 18, 2006. On
November 14, 2006, the Centre received Additional Documents to the
Respondent's Counter-Memorial, together with a letter of November 10, 2006.
Following the Claimant’s request by letter of December 13, 2006 and the
Respondent's confirmation of the same by letter of December 15, 2006, on
December 18, 2006, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 modifying, as
per the Parties’ request, the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 11 of August 31,
2006 to establish a revised timetable for the submission of the remaining

pleadings on the merits.

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 7 of 133

On January 12, 2007, the Claimant filed its Reply on the merits in English. The
Spanish translation followed on February 2, 2007.

After due consideration of (i) the Claimant's proposal of August 10, 2006 on
venue and videoconferencing for the hearing on the merits; (ii) the Respondent's
proposal by letter of August 18, 2006 to address such issues at a later stage; (iii)
the Respondent's communication of January 26, 2007; and (iv) the Claimant’s
letter of January 30, 2007; on February 7, 2007, the Tribunal issued Procedural
Order No. 13 to confirm that the hearing on the merits was to be held in
Washington, D.C.

By letter of March 2, 2007, the Respondent requested an extension of the
deadline for the submission of its Rejoinder on the merits, to which the Claimant
opposed by letter of March 7, 2007. After careful consideration of the Parties’
arguments in such regard, and for the reasons indicated in the Tribunal’s letter of
March 8, 2007, the Parties were informed of the Tribunal’s decision to retain the
deadline of May 7, 2007, agreed by the Parties and fixed in Procedural Order No.
12, for the filing of the Respondent’s Rejoinder on the merits.

2. Replacement of Mr. Whitney Debevoise by Mr. Judd Kessler_as party-

Debevoise’s resignation as an arbitrator.
On April 12, 2007, the Claimant appointed Mr. Judd L. Kessler to substitute Mr.

Debevoise.

3. Preliminary motions and organization of the hearing on the merits
By letter of April 9, 2007, the Respondent made observations with regard to

certain witness statements and expert reports that were filed by the Claimant with
its pleadings on the merits, and requested that Mr. Brian Henderson’s witness
statement be struck from the record because he would not be available to give
oral testimony during the hearing on the merits.

By letter of April 19, 2007, the Claimant made observations to the Respondent’s
letter of April 9, 2007. For the reasons indicated in the Tribunal’s letter of April
24, 2007, the Parties were informed of the Tribunal’s decision not to strike from
the record the statement of Mr. Henderson, which was to be appreciated with
regard to its materiality and weight as permitted by Article 25.6 of the Arbitration
Rules.

On May 7, 2008, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the merits in Spanish.
The English translation followed.

On May 25, 2007, the Parties filed their proposals regarding the pre-hearing
matters suggested by the Tribunal on May 15, 2007, and on the running order of
witnesses and experts, with indication of the matters where the Parties had
reached an agreement.

By letter of May 31, 2007, the Claimant made certain observations and requests
related to the Respondent's Rejoinder.

Following the Tribunal’s invitation by letter of May 31, 2007, on June 4, 2007, the
Parties gave their respective comments in writing on the procedural matters that

remained pending in connection with the organization of the hearing. Further

Briefs and Cost Submissions.

By letter of June 15, 2007, the Claimant made certain comments and proposals
with regard to the time allotted in Procedural Order No. 14 for direct and cross-
examination of witnesses and experts; and filed the Parties’ preliminary
agreement on a schedule for their examination and cross-examination during the
hearing, with some observations.

On June 19, 2007, at the Tribunal’s invitation, the Respondent commented on
the Claimant's letter of June 15, 2007.

By letter of June 28, 2007, the Claimant addressed a number of outstanding
issues in relation to Procedural Order No. 14.

Also on June 28, 2007, at the Tribunal’s invitation, the Respondent commented

On July 3, 2007, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 concerning further
organizational aspects of the hearing and addressing certain issues that had
been raised by the Parties in such regard.

By letter of July 3, 2007, the Respondent requested the suspension of the
proceedings in compliance with the decision of the Fourth Chamber of the
Camara Federal en lo Contencioso-Administrativo dated July 2, 2007, attached
thereto. By letter of July 5, 2007, the Claimant, at the Tribunal’s invitation,
submitted its observations in such regard, objecting to the suspension of the
proceeding.

On July 6, 2007, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 16 rejecting the
request by the Respondent to suspend the arbitral proceedings in the present
case for the reasons indicated therein.

By letter of July 6, 2007, the Respondent made certain comments with regard to
the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 15. Also by letter of July 6, 2007, the

4. Evidentiary hearing and additional documentary evidence requested by
the Tribunal

The Tribunal held a Hearing on the Merits in Washington, D.C. on July 9-20,
2007.

On July 20, 2008, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 18 concerning
certain fact witnesses, ordering the Claimant and the Respondent to produce the
terms of engagement, including any money allowance to the extent that any had
been paid or promised to be paid, of all fact witnesses not currently in the employ
of the Parties in order to give the other party access to such information and an
opportunity to comment on them.

On July 27, 2008, the Claimant filed, following the Tribunal’s request during the
hearing, a copy of National Grid’s letter to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (“MIGA”) requesting a copy of the MIGA policy issued to the company
relating to its investment in the Argentine Republic. Such documents were filed
by the Claimant on August 31, 2007.

Further to Procedural Order No. 18, on July 27, 2008, the Claimant filed copies of
the agreements between National Grid and two of its fact witnesses.

As instructed in Procedural Order No. 18, by letter of August 6, 2007, the

5. Challenge of Mr. Kessler and its resolution
On July 27, 2007, the Respondent filed a notice of its challenge to Mr. Judd L.

Kessler in Spanish, which was rejected by the Claimant by letter of July 31, 2007.
On July 31, 2008, the Respondent filed a revised version of such challenge. The
English translation followed on August 3, 2007.

By letter of August 9, 2007 addressed to the President of the Tribunal,
Mr. Kessler gave his reasons for not resigning from the Tribunal. By letter of
August 9, 2007, the Tribunal requested the Respondent to manifest whether it
wished to insist on the challenge, which the Respondent did by letter of August
14, 2007. By letter of August 17, 2007, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to
proceed to determine the merits in this case.

On August 20, 2007, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 19, among other
things, to invite the Parties to consult each other on the selection of an appointing
authority which would be willing to give a reasoned decision on the challenge.

On August 31, 2007, the Centre received the corrected versions of the original
language transcripts of the hearing agreed between the Parties.

By letter of September 7, 2007, the Claimant informed the Tribunal of the Parties’
agreement that the challenge be decided by the London Court of International
Arbitration (LCIA) rather than by the Court of Arbitration of the International
Chamber of Commerce (the ICC Court), which was the appointing authority in
this case. On September 11, 2007, the LCIA confirmed that it would undertake

the role of appointed authority for the purposes of the challenge.

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 13 of 133

On December 3, 2007, the Division of the LCIA Court composed of Dr. Klaus
Sachs, Dr. Hassan Ali Radhi and Mr. Paul B. Hannon dismissed the challenge to

Mr. Judd L. Kessler on the grounds set forth in that ruling.

6. Filing of Post-Hearing Briefs

On October 1, 2007, the Claimant filed an electronic version of its Post-Hearing
Brief and Cost Submissions. On that date, the Respondent also filed its Post-
Hearing Brief. On October 16, 2007, the Respondent filed its submission on
costs. Hard copies and translations of these submissions were distributed to the
Tribunal and to each opposing party in due course.

7. Appointment of Professor Calvet_as the Tribunal-Appointed Expert and
the Filing of his Report

On November 2, 2007, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, in accordance with
Article 27 of the Arbitration Rules, the appointment of one or more experts might
be of assistance to the Tribunal to review the expert report of Mr. Wood-Collins
and the critical valuation of it done by experts Bello and Molina, inviting the
Parties to attempt to reach an agreement on the selection of one or more
independent experts. On November 30, 2007, the Claimant (i) informed the
Tribunal that the Parties had been unable to reach an agreement in such regard,
and (ii) proposed certain criteria to the Tribunal for the selection and procedure
for the appointment of the expert.

By letter of December 5, 2007, the Respondent commented on the selection

criteria proposed by the Claimant, and proposed the consideration of additional

47.

48.

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 14 of 133

criteria. Further letters were filed by the Parties in this regard between
December 7 and 12, 2007.

Having considered the views and proposals of the Parties, on December 20,
2007, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 20 concerning the criteria, terms
of reference, and procedure to be followed with regard to the selection of an
independent expert. By letter of December 28, 2007, the Parties were informed
of the Tribunal’s intent to appoint Professor Louis Calvet, unless the Parties
raised compelling objections to his appointment. None having been raised, on
February 1, 2008, the Parties were informed of the appointment by the Tribunal
of Professor Louis Calvet as an independent expert.

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 20, on February 6, 2008, Professor
Calvet’s Draft Report dated February 3, 2008 (the “Draft Report”) was submitted
for the consideration of the Parties. On March 3, 2008, the Claimant filed its
comments on the Draft Report, and so did the Respondent on March 4, 2008.
Further communications were made in such regard by the Respondent on March
6, 2008 and by the Claimant on March 12, 2008, the latter attaching the views of
its own expert, Mr. Wood-Collins. Having been authorized by the Tribunal, on
March 25, 2008, the Respondent filed Messrs. Bello and Molina’s views on the
Independent Expert's Draft Report.

On March 14, 2008, the Respondent objected to the inclusion of the award in the
BG Group v. the Argentine Republic case as an exhibit to the Claimant's
comments on Professor Calvet’s Draft Report in light of the obligations set forth

in Procedural Order No. 3 of that case. In such regard, and after due

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 15 of 133

consideration of the Claimant's letters of March 19 and 25, 2008 and of the
Respondent's letters of March 14 and 26, 2008, on March 31, 2008, the Tribunal
informed the Parties that it would consider any information in the public domain
that was brought to its attention by any of the Parties, including an arbitral award
such as the one rendered in BG v. Argentina.

On April 29, 2008, the Centre notified the Parties of the Independent Expert's
Final Report (the “Final Report”) dated April 28, 2008. On May 12, 2008, in
accordance with Procedural Order No. 20 of December 20, 2007, as amended by
the Tribunal on April 25, 2008, each party submitted its corrections to any
manifest errors in the Final Report, adding its respective comments on the Final
Report. On May 15 and 19, 2008, the Claimant and the Respondent filed further
communications in this regard.

On May 23, 2008, the Tribunal, referring to the Parties’ various communications
related to the Final Report of Professor Calvet, informed the Parties that it had
taken note of the Parties’ submissions to the extent they purported to identify
manifest errors in the Final Report. The Tribunal also informed the Parties that it
considered that Professor Calvet had completed his assignment as described in
his terms of reference and that should the Tribunal decide that it needed further

assistance, it would consult with the Parties.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A. THE PRIVATIZATION OF STATE-OWNED ELECTRICAL POWER COMPANIES
As part of its response to solve the economic crisis of 1989, the Respondent

enacted Law 23,696 on August 17, 1989 (the “State Reform Law”), which

52.

53.

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 16 of 133

provided for the privatization of, among other things, State-owned electrical
power companies, and Law 23,928 on March 27, 1991 (the “Convertibility Law”),
which pegged the peso to the dollar at the fixed exchange rate of one peso to
one dollar.

At the time three State-owned companies were operating the electricity sector of
the Argentine Republic: Hidroeléctrica Norpatagonica S.A. (“Hidronor”), Agua y
Energia Eléctrica S.E. (“A y E”) and Servicios Eléctricos del Gran Buenos Aires
S.A. (“SEGBA”). As part of its electricity industry privatization program and
pursuant to Decree 634/91 and Law 24,065 (the “Electricity Law’), the
Respondent established commercial corporations and transferred to them assets
consisting of the electricity transmission and distribution network. The
Respondent created Compania de Transporte de Energia Eléctrica en Alta
Tension S.A. (“Transener”) on May 31, 1992 and transferred to Transener all of
the assets of the high voltage electricity transmission network formerly owned by
Hidronor, A y E and SEGBA. The other transmission assets owned by these
electric power utilities were transferred to six regional transmission companies.
The Electricity Law provided for the creation of two administrative agencies to
supervise and manage the privatized sector: Ente Nacional Regulador de la
Electricidad (“ENRE”) responsible for the regulation and control of all sectors of
the electricity industry, and Compania Administradora de! Mercado Mayorista
Eléctrico S.A. (“CAMMESA’”) responsible for the management of the Wholesale

Electricity Market (“WEM”).

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 17 of 133

In December 1992, the Respondent offered to sell 65% of the shares in
Transener in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the bidding
rules (“Transener Bidding Rules”). In parallel, the Respondent approved a 95-
year concession for Transener to provide the high-voltage electricity transmission
service in the Argentine Republic (the “Concession”).

The Province of Buenos Aires (the “Province”) followed a similar process with
respect to Empresa de Transporte de Energia Eléctrica por Distribucién Troncal
de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (“Transba”). In 1997, the Province offered for
sale 100% of its shares in Transba on the terms and conditions set forth in the
respective bidding rules (“Transba Bidding Rules”), and approved a 95-year
concession for Transba to provide the transmission service in the Province

(‘Transba Concession’).

. CLAIMANT’S INVESTMENTS

In 1993, National Grid Finance B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of National Grid,
together with two US companies —Duke Transener Inc. (“Duke”) and Entergy
Corp (“Entergy”)- and two Argentine companies -SADE Ingenieria y
Construcciones S.A. (“SADE”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Perez Companc
(‘Perez Companc’”), and Eléctrica del Plata S.A., a subsidiary of Sociedad
Comercial del Plata S.A. (“SCP”)— formed a consortium to participate in the
international tender of shares in Transener (the “Consortium”).? The Consortium

incorporated an Argentine company —Compafiia Inversora en Transmisién

Eléctrica Citelec S.A. (“Citelec”)— as the vehicle for its investment in Transener.®
National Grid initially acquired a 15% share of Citelec for US$18.5 million.

Citelec successfully bid for the 65% stake in Transener for US$234.1 million, the
assumption of US$54.2 million in debt transferred to Transener and a mandatory
investment commitment of US$37 million. On June 30, 1993, Transener signed
the Concession Contract with the Government of the Argentine Republic (the
“Concession Contract’).* On July 17, 1993, Transener took over operation of the
high voltage electricity system. Subsequently, National Grid purchased an
additional 26.25% stake in Citelec for US$48.8 million and approved Transener’s
acquisition of a 90% stake in Transba for US$220.2 million and the assumption
of US$10 million in debt owed to the Government of the Province. Transener
subsequently made investments in the upgrading of the electricity transmission
system as well as in certain expansion projects. In 1997, 1999 and 2001,
Transener was awarded three contracts to construct, operate and maintain
transmission lines in return for periodic payments from the beneficiaries of the
lines. These payments, or canones, were to be calculated in US dollars
(“dollars”) and adjusted periodically in accordance with the US Consumer Price
Index (“CPI”) and the US Producer Price Index (“PPI”).

In December 1999, National Grid acquired a further 1.243% interest in Citelec by
way of a capitalization of contributions made by National Grid in October 1999 for

an amount of US$32 million.

C. MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS

On January 6, 2002, Law 25,561 -the Public Emergency and Exchange Rate
Reform Law- (the “Reform Law”)® abolished the currency board set up by the
Convertibility Law in 1991.° Law 25,561 also terminated by operation of law the
right to calculate public utility tariffs in dollars and the right to adjust those tariffs
on the basis of international price indices. Under the terms of Law 25,561, public
service tariffs were converted into Argentine pesos (“pesos”) at the rate of one
peso to one dollar and were frozen at that rate (the so-called “pesification”). All
other dollar-denominated payment obligations and their adjustment by
international indices were made subject to these same restrictions. As of April
2003, the peso had fallen to 2.90 pesos to one dollar.

The Reform Law also forbade electricity transmission and public utility
companies from suspending or modifying compliance with their obligations under
their concessions and licenses. It also established certain conditions for the
renegotiation of public utility contracts. At the time of filing the Statement of
Claim, National Grid affirmed that the renegotiation process had achieved
nothing. In March 2004, National Grid agreed to sell its shares in Citelec to
Dolphin Management S.A. (“Dolphin”) for US$14 million. The Claimant alleges
that this sale was undertaken to mitigate its losses and was made expressly

without prejudice to its rights in this arbitration.” The Respondent disputes the

Exhibit C-69.

an agreement has since been reached with Dolphin.

Ill. OVERVIEW OF THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

61.

A. POSITION OF THE CLAIMANT

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent expropriated its investment by acts

and omissions contrary to the undertakings and assurances related to the

remuneration regime on which its investment was premised, namely, the Reform

Law and Decrees 214/02 and 410/02 (the “Measures”). The Claimant affirms

that the Respondent’s undertakings and assurances are contained in the

following legal instruments (the “Regulatory Framework”):

First, the State Reform Law, Decree 634/91, the Electricity Law, Resolution
137/92 of the Secretariat of Energy (“SoE”), the Transener Bidding Rules
approved by Resolution 1483 (including as attachments the Draft Concession
and its annexes as approved by Decree 2743), the Circulars issued by the
Privatization Committee amending the Transener Bidding Rules (in particular
Circulars No. 3 and No. 6 amending the remuneration regime contained in the
Draft Concession approved by ENRE Resolution 1343/92), and the
Concession that included such amendments.

Second, the legal instruments related to Transba: the Electricity Law and
Buenos Aires Provincial Law 11769 (setting forth the basic framework for the
privatized electricity industry in the Province of Buenos Aires), the Transba

Bidding Rules approved by Decree 107/97 (attaching the Transba Draft

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 21 of 133

Concession approved by Resolution SEyP 0015/96 of the SoE), and the
Transba Concession.

— Third, specific instruments related to Transener’s participation in other
activities, including the expansion of the transmission network and
maintenance, supervisory and technical assistance activities. The following
are the instruments related to the Fourth Line: ENRE Resolution 613/96
(issuing the Certificate of Convenience and Public Need and setting out the
terms for the construction, operation and maintenance of the Fourth Line),
ENRE Resolution 525/97 (approving the Fourth Line Bidding Rules, including
the draft Fourth Line Contract), and ENRE Resolution 1028/97 (approving the
selection of Transener as the successful bidder and authorizing the

conclusion of the Fourth Line Contract).

62. The Claimant summarizes the assurances and guarantees given by the

Respondent in these instruments as follows:

“(i)_tariff-oased remuneration for the transmission service
would be ‘fair and reasonable’ and provide efficient and
prudent Concessionaires with revenue sufficient to cover
reasonable operating costs, taxes, amortizations and a
reasonable rate of return;

(ii) tariff-based remuneration for the transmission service
would be reviewed on the basis of established and
predictable mechanisms, namely (a) a Five Year Review,
which would ensure, among other things, that tariffs
remained sufficient to provide efficient and prudent
Concessionaires with a reasonable rate of return, and that
they reflected any increase in costs beyond the
Concessionaire’s control; and (b) an extraordinary review,
which would ensure that tariffs could be adjusted on
‘objective and justified’ grounds, or in the event that they

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 22 of 133

became ‘unfair, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or
preferential.’

(iii) all remuneration would be calculated in US dollars and
expressed in pesos at the exchange rate applicable at the
date of billing;

(iv) all remuneration would be automatically adjusted every
six months in accordance with the US PPI and US CPI; and

(v) remuneration for the construction, supervision, operation
and maintenance of expansions to the system would be paid
in accordance with the express terms and conditions set out
in the Government resolutions and contracts authorizing
such expansions, such as those authorized for the Fourth
Line, which provided for dollar-based remuneration and, in
most cases, adjustment in accordance with US price
indices.”°
63. According to the Claimant, these guarantees constituted essential conditions for
National Grid’s investment and the ensuing stability of the remuneration regime
provided Transener access to international capital markets to finance the
operation, upgrade, expansion and maintenance of the electricity infrastructure.
The Claimant contends that the Measures adopted since January 2002 breached

these guarantees by:

— failing to respect the promise that Transener’s and Transba’s | tariff-based
remuneration would be “fair and reasonable” and sufficient to cover
reasonable operating costs, taxes, amortizations and provide a “reasonable
rate of return”;

— abolishing Transener’s and Transba’s right to calculate all their remuneration
in dollars and express it in pesos at the exchange rate applicable at the time
of billing;

64.

65.

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 23 of 133

— abolishing Transener’s and Transba’s right to adjust their tariff-based
remuneration every six months in accordance US PPI and CPI indices;

— converting all of Transener’s and Transba’s tariff-based remuneration into
pesos at the artificial rate of one peso to one dollar in spite of the abolition of
the dollar-peso parity;

— freezing Transener’s and Transba’s tariff-based remuneration for the
electricity transmission service as of January 2002;

— failing to conduct the Five-Year Review of Transener due in 2003 and that of
Transba due in 2002; and

— failing to adjust Transener’s and Transba’s tariff-based remuneration on the
basis of “objective and justified” circumstances or on the basis that the
remuneration had become “unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or

preferential” as a result of the January 2002 Law.

The Claimant argues that the Measures destroyed the remuneration regime
established by the instruments described above and the value of Transener.
Transener’s revenue in dollar terms decreased by about one third, and
Transener’s operating income (EBITDA) was reduced in dollar terms to less than
one third. Transener’s dollar denominated debt remained fixed in dollars and in
April 2002 Transener defaulted in its debt service obligations. The Claimant
alleges that the value of National Grid’s investment fell by about 90% as a result
of the Measures.

The Claimant contends that “Government measures that substantially deprive an

investor of the use or enjoyment or result in a significant reduction in the value of

21

66.

"1

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 24 of 133

its investment constitute expropriation, regardless of their form, intent or purpose,
particularly when contrary to specific undertakings and assurances granted to
investors.”® According to the Claimant, it was clear that, when by March 2004
the Claimant agreed to sell its investment, it had been deprived of “the use or
reasonably to be expected benefit of its investment,”"® and that the Measures had
directly and indirectly expropriated the investment. The Claimant points out that
the Measures taken by the Respondent after it agreed to sell its investment only
confirm this conclusion. Indeed, the first proposal made by UNIREN provided for
remuneration in pesos, no adjustment by any index, mandatory investment plans
and a temporary increase of 25% in the Concessionaires’ remuneration from
January 2005 until full tariff review could take place in 2007.

In addition, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent breached: (a) Article 2(2) of
the Treaty by failing to provide a stable and predictable investment environment
in accordance with its legitimate and reasonable expectations and to protect its
investment and by placing a disproportionate and discriminatory burden on
Transener, Transba and National Grid; and (b) the obligation to observe any
obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors.’

The Claimant claims that it is entitled to compensation for expropriation in order
to recover the fair market value of its investment and secondarily and
alternatively, the Claimant claims full recovery of its losses, which amount to the

fair market value of the investment lost on account of the breach of the fair and

69.

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 25 of 133

equitable treatment standard. In the opinion of the Claimant, it is universally
accepted under current international law that “adequate” compensation means
the fair market value of the investment. Accordingly, the Claimant bases its claim
of fair market value on Article 5(1) of the Treaty which requires prompt, adequate
and effective compensation. Furthermore, the Treaty refers to an amount of
compensation that reflects the “genuine value” of the investment which, in some
cases such as CME, it has been interpreted to mean the “fair market value” of
the investment.

The Claimant takes the position that the fair market value of an income-
producing asset or “going concern” is the measure of future prospects and that
should be valued by the discounted cash flow method which is consistent with
economic reality. As a measure of the decrease in value because of the
Measures, the Claimant refers to the difference in the range of fair market values
produced in the DKW Report in July 2001, prior to the taking of the Measures,
and the price agreed with Dolphin for the sale of the Claimant's stake in
Transener in March 2004.

According to the Claimant, it had the obligation to obtain maximum value for its
shareholders and the price agreed for the sale of the Claimant’s share in
Transener to Dolphin is a true reflection of the value of such share because that
price was obtained as a result of an arm’s length transaction between a willing
buyer and a willing seller, and because such price was within the value range
estimated by the ABN AMRO Report and was comparable to the purchase price

obtained in December 2003 for the sale of TAICO’s stake in Transener. In fact,

23

70.

71.

72.

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 26 of 133

alleges the Claimant, using said report as a bench mark, the price of Dolphin is
on the high side since ABN AMRO had assumed acceptance by the creditors of
Transener’s debt restructuring proposal of December 2003 which at the end was
rejected.

The Claimant also explains that, based on the price paid by Dolphin to TAICO,
the value of the Claimant's stake in Transener would be around US$20 million,
but this price includes a premium because Dolphin obtained the right of first
refusal under Citelec’s Shareholders’ Agreement and the right to appoint one
member to Citelec’s board of directors. The Claimant concludes that the
decrease of the fair market value of its investment is about 90%.

The Claimant first claimed interest on damages at the average interest rate
applicable to US six-month certificates of deposit compounded semi-annually
until the date of payment. The Claimant contended that interest should be at a
“normal commercial rate” which the Treaty requires. Later, the Claimant revised
this claim and, instead, argued that damages should be increased by the
expected return on equity for Transener. For that return on equity, the Claimant
set a rate of 12.9% applicable to the period between January 1, 2002 and August
18, 2004 representing the rate of return on equity which, in the absence of the
Measures, the Claimant would have expected to earn during that period plus a
rate of 10.9% per annum thereafter, which represents the expected long-run
return on equity of the Claimant.

The Claimant has also claimed compensation for the breach of the fair and

equitable treatment standard. The Claimant points out that the Treaty does not

24

73.

74.

75.

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 27 of 133

specify damages in case of a breach of the Respondent’s obligations under
Article 2(2) of the Treaty but, pursuant to Chorzéw Factory and SD Myers, the
Claimant demands full compensatory damages to wipe out the effects of the

Respondent's alleged Treaty violations.

. POSITION OF THE RESPONDENT

The Respondent contests the Claimant’s affirmation that the privatization of the
electric power sector was oriented to transfer the state-owned companies to
foreign enterprises. According to the Respondent, its decision to privatize was
not motivated by the need to attract foreign investors but was simply a decision
to transfer to the private sector those activities and risks which the private sector
is more apt to undertake, thus obtaining improved quality of service at
reasonable tariffs.

The Respondent observes that the transmission of electric power includes the
activities of operation and maintenance of the assets assigned to the service but
not to its extensions, and that the legal framework governing the privatization of
the electric power sector only assures an opportunity to companies operating
economically and prudently to obtain sufficient revenues to pay the reasonable
operating costs and to earn a reasonable rate of return. The Respondent affirms
that the decision regarding the amount to be paid for the acquisition of assets
and the subsequent management decisions are the sole responsibility of the
company concerned and its shareholders.

The Respondent contests that SoE had any delegated power in tariff-related

matters. The Respondent points out that Decree 2743/1992 only authorized SoE

25

76.

77.

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 28 of 133

to sign the Concession Contract approved by that decree on behalf of the
Argentine Executive Branch, since the Argentine Congress had previously
assigned to ENRE responsibility for tariff matters. The Respondent also points
out that there is an inconsistency between the desire of tariffs expressed in
dollars and the actual tariff principles reflected in the Electricity Law, which
prevails over the Concession, the Bidding Conditions and the Contract of the
Transfer of shares.

The Respondent explains that the situation of emergency is foreseen in its
Constitution and that the constitutionality of the Measures was upheld by the
Argentine courts. Furthermore, the Respondent explains that the Measures fit
within the theory of unforeseeable risk under Argentine administrative law.
According to the Respondent, those risks arouse out of unforeseeable and
temporary economic factors and not as a result of governmental decisions, and
that the disequilibrium caused by those unforeseeable and temporary economic
factors were of a magnitude that it is impossible to solve by applying the
regulations related to tariff adjustments.

The Respondent argues that Article 4 of the Treaty contemplates emergency
situations and the expression “state of national emergency” in its ordinary sense
means a situation of danger or disaster irrespective of its cause calling for
immediate action at the national level. According to the Respondent, an
emergency could be caused by economic, financial, social or institutional factors.
Furthermore, Article 4 does not specify any requirements regarding the

measures to be adopted. It is obvious from the facts that the emergency existed

26

78.

79.

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 29 of 133

before the Respondent took any measures, including the Measures, to address
it. The Claimant may attempt to argue about whether those were the best
measures to take under the circumstances, but the power to take them is a
prerogative of the State. Furthermore, the measures taken to address the
emergency do not distinguish between national or foreign companies; all are
treated alike.

The Respondent contends that it had no obligation to agree to the tariff
adjustment as requested by the Claimant which had accepted the economic risk;
disputes on tariff obligations are contractual disputes between the
Concessionaires and the State; even if the provisions of the Concession were
applicable as understood by the Claimant, they were not applicable in the
extraordinary circumstances of the Argentine Republic in 2002; omissions or
action of the Respondent do not amount to expropriation nor to a breach of the
other standards under the Treaty; and the Respondent's actions have to be
considered in light of all relevant circumstances, including the economic crisis
and the primary obligation of the State to assure the transport of electric power at
a reasonable price.

In case the Tribunal was to find that the Respondent breached the standards of
protection of the Treaty, the Respondent has invoked the state of necessity
under international law. Based on case law, doctrine and Article 25 of the Draft
Articles on State Responsibility (the “Draft Articles”) in particular, the Respondent
alleges that the crisis situation in the Argentine Republic since 2001 fulfills the

strict requirements of the state of necessity defense: the Respondent did not

27

80.

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 30 of 133

contribute to the situation of necessity; the measures the Respondent took were
the only way to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent
peril and they did not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States
towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole;
investors have been treated in the same manner irrespective of their nationality
or within the same type of activity; and the international obligations of the
Respondent under the Treaty do not exclude the possibility to plead the defense
of the state of necessity.

The Tribunal will review the arguments presented by the parties in more detail
while addressing each of the issues raised by those arguments. First, it will
consider the law to be applied to this dispute followed by a set of preliminary
questions that need to be addressed before examining whether the Treaty has

been breached and the admissibility of the state of necessity defense.

IV. APPLICABLE LAW

81.

12

A. SOURCES GOVERNING THE SETTLEMENT OF THIS DISPUTE

Both Parties agree that the issue of the law applicable to the dispute is
addressed in and governed by Article 8(4) of the Treaty.'* Article 8(4) provides

that:

“The arbitral tribunal shall decide this dispute in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement, the laws of the
Contracting Party involved in this dispute, including its rules

preeminent role of Argentine law); Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief ("Post-Hearing Brief,” at II
“Applicable Law’), para. 66 (emphasizing the role of international law to determine the scope of
protection due to the investment).

on conflict of laws, the terms of any specific agreement

concluded in relation to such an investment and the

applicable principles of international law.”
This provision points to the application of the Treaty itself, Argentine law
(including its rules on conflict of laws), and “the applicable principles of
international law.” Although the Parties do not disagree that these are the
relevant sources of law applicable to this dispute, they note the absence of
specific guidelines under the Treaty as to which aspect of the dispute is governed
by one source or the other and how those sources interact in case of conflict inter
se."®
Article 8(4) of the Treaty, however, expressly indicates the scope of application of
the contracting State’s domestic law, such as in defining the type of assets or
property rights making up an “investment.” Thus, according to Article 1(c)(i)(bb)
of the Treaty, Argentine law governs who qualifies as an ‘investor’’* and, while
addressing the concept of “asset” in order to ascertain what is an eligible
“investment” under the Treaty, Article 1(a) specifically indicates that such concept
is to be defined pursuant to the law of the host State: “...investment means every
kind of asset defined in accordance with the laws and regulations of the
Contracting Party in whose territory the investment _is_ made ....” (Emphasis
added).

See Respondent's Alegato Posterior, para. 6 (“...e! Tratado no distingue en absoluto donde se aplica
el derecho de la parte contratante que sea parte en la controversia y en qué areas de la controversia
el derecho de la parte contratante no se aplica’). See also, Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 66
(noting that “Article 8(4) of the Treaty sets out the sources of law, which may be relevant to any
investment dispute, but does not specify how such sources are to interact”).

18

16

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 32 of 133

Argentine law is also relevant for the purpose of measuring the investor's
expectations under the Regulatory Framework governing the newly privatized
electricity transmission services, as presented to foreign investors at the time of
the privatization and as subsequently modified by Argentine law. Accordingly, in
its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal relied upon and applied Argentine law in
support of its finding that commitments were made to the investor under
Argentine law that gave rise to a claim under the Treaty.’ It is clear that in such
preliminary decision, as well as in this final Award, the Tribunal dealt with the law
of the host State as a matter of law, dispelling the notion that Argentine law may
be considered a mere matter of fact.'®

Neither party has invoked the application of Argentine rules of private
international law, and it bears noticing that there is no contract concluded
between the Claimant and the Republic of Argentina, the dispute between the
two focusing on the scope of protection to which the Claimant’s investment is
entitled under the Treaty. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that Argentine
substantive law, the Treaty and relevant principles of international law are the

sources of law applicable to this dispute.

. HIERARCHY OF SOURCES AND GAP-FILLING METHODOLOGY

Article 8(4) of the Treaty grants a preeminent role to the Treaty itself for the

purpose of ascertaining: a) whether the investor's rights to the “investment” may

See Respondent's Alegato Posterior, para. 7 (to the effect that “...e/ derecho doméstico no debe ser

have been illegally restricted under the substantive standards provided by the
Treaty; and (b) whether such restriction may be imputed to the Respondent.
Indeed, the preeminence of the Treaty as /ex specialis governing the scope of
protection owed to the investor is the main purpose for concluding a bilateral
treaty aimed at protecting foreign investments.

The Treaty, however, is not a self-contained, stand-alone legal framework, but
rather an international bilateral treaty which must be “integrated” with underlying
principles of international law in order to fill its gaps. Thus the remission in Article
8(4) to “the applicable principles of international law.” Accordingly, whether the
Respondent breached the Treaty and which defenses are available against such
breach are matters to be decided according to the treaty itself, supplemented by
principles of international law as may be relevant to the issues in dispute.
Claimant makes much of the issue that, for the purpose of adjudicating the
responsibility of the Respondent under the Treaty, international law displaces
Argentine domestic law.’ Yet, the doctrinal and jurisprudential authorities
brought to the attention of the Tribunal fail to disclose any collision or
contradiction between the protection to which Claimant’s property rights are
entitled under Argentine constitutional and administrative law and the protection it
ought to receive under international law. Indeed, Mr. Rovira’s and Dr.
Cassagne’s declarations seem consonant not only on the Respondent's
sovereign authority to take the measures it deems necessary to safeguard the

social and economic rights of its population, but also on the State’s obligation to

See Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 66 (“...the scope of protection (of the investment) is a matter
for international law which simply displaces Argentine administrative law on those issues since what
is being adjudged is the international responsibility of the Argentine state’).

provide compensation when, in the exercise of its police powers, property rights
protected under Articles 14 and 17 of the Argentine Constitution are affected. '®

Even if the protection of the investor's property rights were to differ under
Argentine municipal law on the one hand, and the Treaty and applicable
principles of international law on the other, the Tribunal takes notice that
Argentine constitutional law expressly incorporates the latter into the former.
Thus, according to consistent case-law of the Argentine Supreme Court, well
before the adoption of the constitutional reforms of 1994,"° international treaties
are incorporated into Argentine law as the “supreme law of the land,” preempting
conflicting provincial and federal laws.” Accordingly, as a matter of Argentine
law, the standards of protection granted by an international investment treaty and
applicable principles of international law prevail over any lower standard provided

24

by domestic law,” although, as noted before, no discrepancies in this regard

have been brought up by the Parties to the attention of the Tribunal.

90. In brief, pursuant to Article 8(4) and other provisions of the Treaty, the Tribunal
shall apply Argentine law to ascertain the concept of “asset” and for the purpose
of determining the “investment” eligible under the Treaty. Also governed by
Argentine substantive law is the regulatory framework designed to transfer the
transmission of high and medium voltage electricity from public domain to the
private sector, thus providing specific commitments to the Claimant at the time of
its investment. Questions regarding the protection of the Claimant's investment
and the excuses that may be relied upon to disregard such protection are
governed by the Treaty itself, supplemented by principles of international law, as

may be relevant, applicable, and relied upon by the Parties.

V. PRELIMINARY MATTERS

A. RELEVANCE OF WHETHER THE MEASURES WERE TAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH
ARGENTINE Law.

1. Positions of the Parties

91. The Parties have argued extensively whether the Measures met the criteria of
emergency measures under the Argentine Constitution. While the Claimant
alleges that they did not meet these criteria, the Respondent dismisses the

Claimant's arguments for their lack of merit.

 

BIT ratified by Law No. 24123, was held to be immunized from the “pesification” regime adopted
under Argentina's emergency legislation on the ground that the protection afforded by the bilateral
investment treaty could not be overridden by domestic legislation (“...dada la preeminencia de los
tratados internacionales sobre el derecho interno, debe concluirse, con base en las disposiciones
contenidas en el Convenio Internacional aprobado por Ley 24123 que las garantias acordadas en los

2. Considerations of the Tribunal

The Tribunal considers it unnecessary to proceed to a separate analysis of the
legality of the Measures under Argentine law. A finding by the Tribunal whether
affirmative or negative would not be determinant of the alleged liability of the
Respondent under the Treaty. For this reason the Tribunal will limit its
considerations to whether the actions of the Respondent breached the standards
of treatment under the Treaty and international law. This does not mean that
Argentine law is irrelevant in proceeding to such determination; to the contrary,
Argentine law is relevant and will be part of the Tribunal’s considerations as

explained above.

. NATURE OF THE DISPUTE

1. Positions of the Parties

The Respondent has argued that the dispute is a dispute about the devaluation
of its currency, a right that the Respondent claims to have as a sovereign. On
the other hand, if the dispute is not about such devaluation, then the Respondent
maintains that this is a contractual dispute over which this Tribunal does not have
jurisdiction.

The Claimant has explained that it does not question the right of the Respondent
to devalue the peso but argues vehemently that the Measures taken in the
aftermath of the devaluation did violate specific engagements of the Respondent,

which precisely foresaw such possibility.

2. Considerations of the Tribunal

The Tribunal has already considered the nature of the dispute between the
Parties as part of its Decision on Jurisdiction. It then held that: “The arguments
advanced by the parties and the facts alleged by them show that a dispute exists
between them as to whether the protection due to the investor under the Treaty
has been violated and as to whether commitments were made to the investor
under the laws of the Argentine Republic that would give rise to a claim under the
Treaty. These claims extend beyond claims for breach of contract as
contemplated in Vivendi //. Therefore, the Tribunal is satisfied that a dispute
exists between the parties concerning an obligation of the Respondent with
regard to an investment of the Claimant..." The Tribunal also observed that
“the Respondent's defense relies on rejecting the possibility that Claimant may
bring claims under the Treaty separately from claims arising under the
Contracts,” and then held “this is a matter to be proven by the Claimant at the
time of discussing the merits of its claims.” Whether the Claimant has proven
its claims under the Treaty is what the Tribunal considers in this Award.

As to the issue of devaluation, the Tribunal recognizes that the Respondent has
under international law a right to devalue its currency and notes that this right has
not been questioned by the Claimant. As the case has been argued by the
Claimant, this is not the issue before the Tribunal. The issue is whether, by

allegedly dismantling the Regulatory Framework on which the Claimant relied to

make its investment, the Respondent has breached the commitments made

under the Treaty in respect of treatment of investments.

. CUT-OFF DATE

1. Positions of the Parties

The Respondent has objected to references by the Claimants to facts that may
have occurred after the sale of shares in Transener and which may arguably
confirm the wisdom of the sale. Conversely, the Respondent itself has referred
in its defense to facts that occurred after that sale -e.g., the results of the
renegotiation of the Concession after the Claimant sold its shares, and the
subsequent rise in price of the shares on the Buenos Aires stock exchange-in
order to prove that the Claimant’s decision to sell its shares in Transener was a

misguided business decision.

2. Considerations of the Tribunal
The dispute before the Tribunal is the dispute as it stood at the time the
Statement of Claim was filed. The Tribunal may refer to events which occurred

thereafter to the extent that the Parties have relied on them.

. WAS THE CLAIMANT A DILIGENT INVESTOR?

1. Positions of the Parties

In its defense, the Respondent has alleged that the Claimant acted irresponsibly
by paying in excess for the Concession and the “non-regulated” businesses of
Transba and the Fourth Line, increasing the indebtedness of Transener to

finance such businesses and selling its shares at the time it did. In brief, the

36

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 39 of 133

100.

101.

Respondent points to a line of bad business decisions which were entirely the
responsibility of the Claimant and to which the losses should be attributed.

The Respondent alleges that the Claimant was not a prudent bidder and did not
foresee the contingencies of its investment. The Respondent points out that: (a)
the Claimant refers only to the process of due diligence carried out in the context
of bidding for Transener but does not accompany the due diligence report in its
documentation, which would show the extent to which the risk of the investment
was known to the Claimant at the time it took the decision to make it; (b) the
consortium of which the Claimant was part offered for Transener a 36% more
than the next highest bidder and nearly three times as much as the lowest
bidder; and (c) none of the written requests for clarification or information during
the bidding process came from the Claimant.

The Claimant has explained that it was part of a consortium and that the tasks of
due diligence were divided among the consortium members and each member
shared the results with the others. The Claimant explains that it had engaged a
law firm with worldwide experience in the privatization of the electric power
sector, a reputable Argentine law firm and a well known and experienced
investment banker. Furthermore, the Claimant retained a team of its own
engineers to appraise the assets of the Concession and approached repeatedly
the Privatization Committee to express its concern over the lack of connection
between the dollar calculated tariffs and the peso denominated tariffs which

resulted in Circulars 3 and 6 and in the amendment of the Contract. In addition,

37

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 40 of 133

102.

104.

the regulated asset base for purposes of the first tariff review, as calculated by
ENRE, took as a point of departure the price paid for the Concession.

The Respondent in turn has argued that there was scant evidence of the
involvement of the two law firms and that consultations with the Privatization

Committee needed to be in writing, which the Claimant has disputed.

2. Considerations of the Tribunal

The Tribunal considers that whether the price paid for the Concession was
excessive is not material to the claim presented by the Claimant. The claim for
damages is not based on the price paid for the Concession. Even if it were, the
regulator, ENRE, has already accepted such price for purposes of the first tariff
review after discounting the portion that, in its judgment, could be attributed to
the price paid for the opportunity to develop other businesses in the Argentine
Republic. In any case, the thoroughness of the due diligence carried out by the
Claimant prior to the decision to invest in Transener should not be considered in
isolation from the overall due diligence carried out by the consortium, which was
shared among consortium members.

As to whether the bidding conditions permitted verbal questions, the text of the
bidding conditions, as evidenced by the arguments exchanged by the Parties,
may be subject to more than one interpretation. No evidence has been
presented indicating that the Privatization Committee had prohibited such
practice. In any case, it is beyond doubt that the replies had to be in writing for
the benefit of all interested bidders, whether or not they had asked questions.

The replies appear in Circulars 3 and 6.

38

105.

106.

107.

108.

For these reasons, and because these arrangements were entered into as part of
a detailed process of offer and acceptance by unrelated parties having
considerable business sophistication and experience, the Tribunal concludes that
the arguments of the Respondent with regard to lack of due diligence carried out
by the Claimant in order to make the investment are without merit.

The Respondent has also argued that the Claimant acted imprudently by
increasing its investment in Citelec in the course of subsequent years and by
incurring excessive debt and incurring it in dollars.

The Claimant has justified its decision to increase its shareholding in Citelec in
the demonstrated well functioning of the Regulatory Framework after the first
tariff review. As for the level of indebtedness, it has provided comparative data
for the electric power sector showing that a 1:1 debt equity ratio is a reasonable
and normal level of debt. The Claimant has also argued that debt is financially
cheaper than equity and, therefore, it contributes to lower tariffs than if a utility is
entirely equity financed.

The Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant’s level of indebtedness reflects
industry practice. As for the criticism that debt was incurred in dollars, this is a
question related to the interpretation of article 41 of the Electricity Law. The
Tribunal will now turn to this issue deferring an examination of the timing of the

sale of the shares to a later point in the Award.

E. CURRENCY OF THE CONTRACT, ASSUMPTION OF THE EXCHANGE RISK AND LINKAGE OF
THE CALCULATION OF THE TARIFF IN DOLLARS TO CONVERTIBILITY

1. Positions of the Parties

109. The Claimant has interpreted the Regulatory Framework as entitling Transener to

a tariff expressed in pesos but calculated in dollars at the rate of exchange in
effect at the date of billing. The Claimant refers first to the following statement
found in the addendum to the Government's Transener Selling Memorandum of
March 1973 prepared by Kleinwort Benson, Credit Suisse, First Boston and
Banco General de Negocios: “All remuneration will be calculated in dollars (even
though payment could take place in pesos) and will be readjusted each seasonal
period according to a formula which takes into account the variation of the retail

and wholesale price index in the United States.”

110. Then the Claimant recounts how the draft Concession contract attached to the

111.

Bidding Conditions was amended through Circulars 3 and 6 to ensure that there
was no ambiguity as to who was carrying the risk of a future devaluation of the
peso. For ease of reference it will be helpful to reproduce here the original
Article 15 Sub-Annex II of the draft Concession contract:

“Todos los conceptos remuneratorios se calcularan en

dolares estadounidenses. El Cuadro Tarifario resultante se

expresara en pesos teniendo en cuenta para ello la relacién

de convertibilidad al peso establecida en el Articulo 3 del

Decreto No. 2128/91, reglamentario de la Ley No. 23928

[the Convertibility Law]. La remuneracién de la

Concesionaria se adecuara cada seis (6) meses a partir del

1 de mayo de 1993 y tendra vigencia semestral.”
According to the Claimant, Mr. Williams of National Grid sought to clarify the

following sentence: “la relacidn de convertibilidad al peso establecida en el

40

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 43 of 133

112.

113.

114.

Articulo 3 del Decreto No. 2128/91, reglamentario de la Ley No 23.928.” To this
effect, Mr. Williams allegedly approached Mr. Bastos, the Secretary of Energy,
who issued Circular 3 in order to delete from Draft Article 15 the reference to the
Convertibility Law, thus leaving only a reference to the exchange rate in effect:

“Todos los conceptos remuneratorios se calcularan en

dolares estadounidenses. El Cuadro Tarifario resultante se

expresara en pesos teniendo en cuenta para ello la relacién

de convertibilidad al peso vigente. La remuneracién de la

Concesionaria se adecuara cada seis (6) meses a partir del

1 de mayo de 1993 y tendra vigencia semestral.”
According to the Claimant, the text remained ambiguous as to the timing of the
conversion from dollars to pesos, so Mr. Williams allegedly sought further
clarifications approaching Mr. Bastos once again. Circular 6 sought to clarify the
timing of the conversion by amending the second sentence of Draft Article 15 to
read thus: “El Cuadro Tarifario resultante se expresara en pesos teniendo en
cuenta la relacién de convertibilidad al peso vigente al momento de la
facturaci6n.”
Therefore, the Claimant argues, the risk of devaluation is limited to the period
between the issuance of the bill and the moment such bill was actually paid. The
Claimant observes that these changes introduced by Circulars 3 and 6 were
reflected in the Transba Contract from the beginning, i.e., from the time Transba
was privatized.
The understanding of the Respondent is different. The Respondent points out
that the Contract is denominated in pesos not in dollars, as clearly stated in Sub-
Annex II C of the Contract where all values are expressed in pesos. At the time

of the first Five-Year Tariff Review in 1998, Resolution 1650/98 fixed in pesos the

a1

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 44 of 133

115.

tariff values for the second five-year tariff period and, although Transener
requested reconsideration of certain aspects of the review, it did not object to the
tariff values being expressed in pesos. Transener had no right to receive dollars
from CAMMESA and under Article 619 of the Argentine Civil Code an obligation
denominated in a certain currency is satisfied when it is paid in that currency.
The Respondent recalls that during the privatization of Transener a potential
bidder, Techint, sought clarification in writing from the Privatization Committee on
Article 15 of the Sub-Annex II A to the effect that the tariff Schedule would be
expressed in dollars to match the calculation of the remuneration in dollars:

“el CUADRO TARIFARIO expresara las tarifas a percibir en

dolares estadounidenses, los que deberan ser convertidos a

pesos al tipo de cambio vigente al cierre del Ultimo dia habil

anterior al de la fecha de emisién de cada factura.

Concordantemente con ello, solicitamos se establezcan en

dolares estadounidenses los valores del SUBANEXO II C.”

(E-AR 95)

The request was denied by the Privatization Committee.

It is the view of the Respondent that obligations denominated in pesos with an
adjustment clause in foreign currency represent a commitment against inflation
and not against devaluation. The Respondent refers also to the amendments of
Draft Article 15 and Sub-Annex C. The Respondent points out that, after the
request for clarification of Techint, Circular 3 Sub-Annex A does not refer any
more to the Convertibility Law and the ensuing Decree but instead refers in Sub-
Annex C to “Valores expresados en pesos calculados a la relacién de
convertibilidad establecida en el articulo 3 del Decreto 2128 de la Ley 23928.”

Next day Circular 6 amended Draft Article 15 and changing again Sub-Annex C

42

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 45 of 133

by deleting the reference to the Convertibility Law while maintaining the
reference to the decree.*

116. The Respondent has also called the attention of the Tribunal to ENRE’s
Resolution 28/2001. According to the Respondent this resolution shows that
there was no exchange risk assumed by the Argentine Republic and evidences a
completely different interpretation of Article 15. The Respondent contends that it
is constitutional under Argentine law to displace adjustment clauses when they
cease to be representative of the underlying economic reality. The Convertibility
Law intended to stabilize all contracts without recourse to adjustment
mechanisms that could generate inflationary expectations. According to the
Respondent, this is the purpose of Article 9 of the Convertibility Law, which the
Claimant considers the pillar of the investment. This article dismantles all prior
adjustment indices in contracts concluded before the enactment of that law.
Hence Article 8 of Law 25.561, consistently with the Respondent's jurisprudential
tradition, was merely meant to displace indexation in dollars or other foreign

currencies.

2. Considerations of the Tribunal

117. The Tribunal concurs with the Respondent that the Contract is denominated in
pesos and so are the tariffs. This is evident from the text of Sub-Annex C, but
this is not the relevant point on which the Parties’ expectations or ex post-facto

interpretations differ. The real question is related to the right to calculate the tariff

119.

120.

in dollars even if the electricity bills are denominated and are to be paid in pesos.
The fact that users are billed in pesos does not address the issue of how the
amount of the bill is to be calculated which may well have meant to vary
depending on the relationship of the peso to the dollar.

At the time the shares in Transener were sold to private investors the rate of
exchange was one peso to one dollar. As explained by the Claimant, its concern
was what would happen if that rate changed, as it has changed so many times
during the last decades of the Respondent's economic history. Hence,
clarifications were sought by the Claimant and others such as Techint. The
Respondent has attached particular importance to the fact that the Privatization
Committee rejected Techint’s request to express in dollars the tariffs in Sub-
Annex C. The Respondent has also pointed out the importance of the switch to
Sub-Annex C of the reference to Article 3 of Decree 2128, while the Claimant has
placed emphasis on the deletion of the reference to the Convertibility Law and
Decree 2128 from Article 15 of Sub-Annex A.

The changes introduced by Circulars 3 and 6 in these two Sub-Annexes had the
result that, in Sub-Annex A, there is a reference to the convertibility relationship
in effect at the time of billing, while Sub-Annex C contemplates this relationship
as set forth in Article 3 of Decree 2128. This reference is the key to the
argument of the Respondent linking the tariff regime to the Convertibility Law.
The Tribunal has difficulty in following the argument that dollar-adjustment
clauses of obligations in pesos are aimed, in the Argentine Republic, to protect

the creditor against inflation and not against devaluation. While such clauses

44

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 47 of 133

121.

may be safeguard against inflationary adjustments such to the extent that
exchange rate movements reflect inflation differences in the countries concerned,
and that such clauses may, in some instances, have been used for such purpose
in the Argentine Republic, the primary purpose and effect of dollar-adjustment
clauses is to protect the actual value of the tariffs from the likelihood of
devaluation or depreciation of the local currency. In the instant case, the
protection against inflation was limited to the inflation of dollar priced goods and
services by indexation to the CPI and PPI of the United States. If the purpose of
calculating the tariffs in dollars had been merely to protect against peso inflation,
this could have been more directly achieved by incorporating the use of a local
price index. Inflation in the Argentine Republic does not seem to have been a
concern at the time and a reading of the remuneration provisions makes evident
the intent to maintain the value of the remuneration stream in dollar terms, either
because of dollar inflation or because of changes in the parity of the peso and
the dollar. To read Article 15 differently would deprive of any meaning the
calculation of the tariff in dollars.

The Respondent has argued that there was an essential connection between the
Convertibility Law and the tariff regime. There is no doubt that given the
Respondent's economic history eloquently described by the Respondent, there
was a need to link the tariff regime to the Convertibility Law. It is less certain,
however, whether this link has the effect argued by the Respondent. The
Tribunal shall address this issue with an analysis of Article 8 of the Emergency

Law:

45

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 48 of 133

122.

123.

“Disponese que a partir de la sancion de la presente ley, en

los contratos celebrados por la Administracién Publica bajo

normas de derecho publico, comprendidos entre ellos los de

obras y servicios publicos, quedan sin efecto las clausulas

de ajuste en ddlar o en otras divisas extranjeras y las

clausulas indexatorias basadas en indices de precios de

otros paises y cualquier otro mecanismo indexatorio. Los

precios y tarifas resultantes de dichas clausulas, quedan

establecidos en pesos, a la relacidn de cambio un peso ($1)

= un délar estadounidense (US$ 1).”
The text of this article contradicts the allegation of the Respondent as to the
meaning of the adjustment clauses. The last sentence of the article ensures that
there is no doubt that prices and tariffs resulting from the application of the
adjustment clauses are in pesos and at the 1:1 exchange rate. The legislator
seems to assume that, when such adjustment clauses exist, the resulting prices
or tariffs may effectively be equivalent to being in a foreign currency, hence the
need to affirm “quedan establecidos en pesos.” If this were not the case, there
would not be any need to refer to the currency in which the obligation is
denominated. Similarly, the need to establish the parity at 1:1 reflects that the
parties to the contracts contemplated in Article 8 might otherwise have been
entitled to a different rate of exchange. It seems clear, therefore, that if the
interpretation of the Contract by the Respondent were correct, Article 8 of the
Emergency Law would have been unnecessary.
The Respondent also places particular emphasis on the fact that the result of
Circulars 3 and 6 was to transfer the reference made to Decree 2128 from Sub-
Annex A to Sub-Annex C and not to eliminate all reference to the Convertibility

Law and Decree 2128. Article 15 of Sub-Annex A refers to the rate of exchange

in effect at the time of billing. Such rate of exchange might have been either the

46

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 49 of 133

124.

125.

one indicated in Decree 2128 or a rate of exchange fixed elsewhere. To this
extent, the Tribunal recognizes that there is some potential for contradiction
between the two Sub-Annexes. However, if we assume the good faith of the
Respondent and if we take into account the context in which the changes were
made, the two provisions must be interpreted harmoniously so that neither is
deprived of its meaning. Hence, if the parity in Article 3 of Decree 2128 did not
refer to the parity in effect at the time of billing at any point in time, we must
assume that this parity would have been changed accordingly.

The Respondent has also argued that the tariff regime in the Contract is subject
to the tariff principles of the Electricity Law. Article 40 of the Electricity Law
requires that the tariff shall be just and reasonable. In support of this point the
Respondent has noted that Transener itself, at the time of the first five-year tariff
review, appealed to the principles of Article 40 to increase the remuneration
proposed by CAMMESA. According to the Respondent, this is proof that the
understanding of the Concessionaire was clear as regards the overriding
importance of these principles in respect of the remuneration set forth in the

Contract. As indicated above, the Tribunal does not agree.

. THE INVESTMENT OF NATIONAL GRID

1. Positions of the Parties

The Respondent has argued that the investment made by the Claimant is limited
to its purchase of shares of Transener through Citelec and that the Transba
Concession and the Fourth Line Contract are not part of the Claimant's

investment. These were operations decided by Transener, an Argentine

47

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 50 of 133

company, and not the Claimant. It is the view of the Respondent that Transener
is not a protected investor under the definition of investor in Article 1 of the

Treaty. The Claimant takes the opposite view.

2. Considerations of the Tribunal

126. The actual issue raised by the Respondent is whether indirect investments are
eligible as protected investments under the Treaty. The structure of the
investment shows that the Claimant channeled its investment in the Argentine
Republic through seven companies 100% owned by the Claimant and not
necessarily British companies.” The Treaty definition of investment
encompasses direct and indirect investments and, therefore, for the purpose of
ascertaining which British investor ultimately qualifies for protection under the
Treaty, there is no difference between an investment made by Citelec and one
made through Transener for purposes of protection of the ultimate British

investor under the Treaty.

G. THE ISSUE OF WHETHER TRANSBA AND THE FOURTH LINE ARE “REGULATED
INVESTMENTS”

1. Positions of the Parties

127. The Respondent argues that Transba and the Fourth Line are not part of the
Concession and, therefore, are not included in the protection provided by the
regulatory regime of the Concession. Transener had no obligation to expand its

business, but rather the opportunity to do so as a private business decision and

?8 Statement of Claim, Exhibit C-19.

48

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 51 of 133

128.

129.

at its own risk. The Respondent did not solicit these investments or made any
promises with respect to them.

The Claimant on the other hand alleges that both businesses are regulated and
that, while the decision to invest may have been its own, it was made in light of
the assurances established in the Regulatory Framework. The Claimant refers to
the affirmation contained in Respondent’s Statement of Defense to the effect
that: “En lo que respecta a las alegadas garantias regulatorias a favor del
concesionario Transba...en nada se diferencia de lo regulado en el Marco
Regulatorio Nacional, el cual resulta asimilable al aplicado a la concesién de
Transener.”” The Claimant points out that Kleinwort Benson, advisors to the
Province in the privatization, sought to attract the Claimant and wrote to
Mr. Dennis Elsey informing him of the recently announced intention of the
Province to privatize its controlling interest in ESEBA (Transba) which represents
“a major opportunity to invest in the Argentine electricity sector.”

More specifically on the issue of regulation the Claimant draws the attention of
the Tribunal to the regulatory steps taken for the realization of the investment in
Transba: ENRE Resolution 51 of 1993 approving amendments to Transener’s
bylaws so as to include the acquisition of transmission companies within in the
purposes of Transener the acquisition of transmission companies; the fact that
the Government representatives on the board of Transener representing 25% of

shareholding approved the decision to acquire Transba; ENRE Resolution 543

Statement of Defense, para.158. (“The purported regulatory guarantees in favour of the

concessionaire, TRANSBA...do not differ at all from the regulations of the Federal Regulatory
Framework, which can be considered similar to the applied to TRANSENER’s concession.”)

132.

approving the decision to acquire Transba; and Decree 2387 of 1997 of the
Province awarding 100% of the shares in Transba to Transener.
As regards the Fourth Line, the Claimant points out that ENRE Resolution 525/97
approved the bidding rules and draft contract, and ENRE Resolution 1028/1997
approved the selection of Transener as the winning bidder and authorized the
conclusion of the Fourth Line Contract.
The Claimant also addresses the question of whether the Fourth Line Contract is
a contract under public or private law and refers to the “Whereas” clauses of
Resolution 28/2001 of ENRE:

“Que el contrato suscripto entre las partes no representa un

contrato tipico en el que corresponda la aplicacién de las

normas del derecho privado sino que por el contrario le son

aplicables varias disposiciones propias del derecho publico,

sin duda por la caracteristica de ‘servicio publico’ que

representa una instalaci6n de transporte de energia

eléctrica.

Que el contrato fue materializado bajo la vigencia de las

normas reglamentarias que son de orden publico por

resguardar del interés general que representa la

administracién del Mercado Eléctrico Mayorista (MEM).”
2. Considerations of the Tribunal
The reasons behind the decision to use Transener to bid for the Transba
Concession and the Fourth Line Contract do not seem to respond to any obscure
purpose to increase debt of Transener rather than the debt of the Claimant.
Irrespective of the issue of how these contracts were financed it was clear that
the opportunity to participate in these businesses was part of the Concession

even if, as the Respondent had made adamantly clear, it was not an obligation.

In fact, the price received for the shares in Transener was paid in part for this

50

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 53 of 133

133.

134.

opportunity as reflected in the discount that ENRE made to such price when
calculating the regulated asset base (RAB) for purpose of the first tariff review.
The Tribunal considers that the Concession, the Transba Concession and the
Fourth Line Contract are regulated businesses whether by the State or the
Province. The instances in which ENRE intervened are no different between the
two Concessions. As admitted by ENRE itself, the Fourth Line had sufficient
elements of public interest to justify regulation. The Respondent has approvingly
referred to the Enron award in respect of the separation of regulated and
unregulated business. But the matter here seems to be different since here we
have “Other Businesses” of Transener beyond the regulated business as defined
by the Claimant. The distinction drawn in the Enron award between “regulated”
and “unregulated” businesses was drawn in a different context, namely, whether
the tribunal should consider as the business of TGS all of its lines of business, as
actually argued by the Respondent in that case, or only those which were
regulated. In contrast, one of the questions faced by the Tribunal in this case
focuses on ascertaining which businesses of Transener are regulated, since it is
accepted by both Parties that the claim does not refer to all businesses of
Transener.

The Tribunal is mindful that Transener had no obligation to expand its business.
However, the fact that Transener could avail itself of this option is not by itself the
determinant factor as to whether a business is regulated or not. The nature of
Transener’s decision to invest in the Fourth Line and Transba is no different from

the decision of the Claimant to invest in Transener. These decisions were

51

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 54 of 133

business decisions predicated on certain conditions established in the regulatory
framework adopted by the Respondent or the Province. In both cases the crucial
issues are: What were these conditions? What assurances were provided to
investors in the sector? What significance did they have from the perspective of
the international responsibility of the Respondent under the Treaty? These

questions will now be addressed by the Tribunal.

VI. BREACH OF THE TREATY
A. ARTICLE 5(1)
1. Positions of the Parties
135. The Claimant has alleged that the actions described in detail above breached

Article 5(1) of the Treaty. Article 5(1) reads in relevant part as follows:

“Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall
not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to measures
having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation
(hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”) in the territory of
the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose
related to the internal needs of the Contracting Party on a
non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and
effective compensation...”

136. The Respondent has denied that it expropriated the Claimant's investment. The

Respondent argues in support of its position:

First, that indirect expropriation as conceived by the
Claimant does not exist in international law since its rights as
shareholder remain intact until the Claimant decided to sell
them at its own initiative. For indirect expropriation to exist
there must be forced deprivation of shares, interference in
the management, denial of access to labor or materials, or
excessive or arbitrary taxes.

Second, that a breach of contract does not constitute an
expropriation; the Treaty does not provide protection against

52

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 55 of 133

137.

138.

139.

disappointing performance of the investment nor does it
guarantee that the investment will be profitable.

Third, that the acts of the Argentine authorities were

legitimate and proportionate regulatory acts of general

application adopted in good faith and in order to protect the

human rights of the population.
Furthermore and based on the analysis of the tribunal in Saluka, the Respondent
contends that the rationale for regulatory measures may be refuted only by clear
and convincing proof of error or inappropriate action and that, without such proof,
deprivation by legitimate regulation does not give a right to compensation.
In its Reply, the Claimant contests these three lines of defense. First, the
Claimant notes that it is possible that expropriatory measures may affect the
value and economic benefit of an investment without necessarily altering the
owner’s formal right to his property and quotes arbitral and national case law in
support of this argument. The Claimant points out that the reference by the
Respondent to the Third Restatement of the Foreign Relations Law of the US
does not include consideration of the key passage on taking of property.
According to the Claimant, the proper test as to whether a regulatory measure
amounts to expropriation is not based on its reasonableness or proportionality,
but on whether it reverses specific commitments given by the government to the
investor which give rise to its legitimate expectations that the government will
take a certain line of conduct in given circumstances. The Claimant points out
that, the Respondent, while relying on Methanex, omits a key sentence from the
quoted paragraph —the key sentence: “unless specific commitments had been
given by the regulating government to the then putative foreign investor

contemplating investment that the government would refrain from such

53

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 56 of 133

regulation.” The existence of commitments, the Claimant urges, is the essential
point which distinguishes the present case from those cited by the Respondent in
support of its position (Feldman, Generation Ukraine, Azinian, Saluka, Oskar
Chinn and Sedco). The Claimant observes that tribunals may focus on the
proportionality or reasonableness of measures if prior specific commitments have
not been established, but this test is irrelevant when specific governmental
commitments have been made. Even if this were not the case, the Claimant's
position is that the Measures were, nevertheless, disproportionate and
unreasonable since the Respondent had given assurances that the rules referred
to above would apply in a situation of monetary instability and cost variations.

140. The Claimant argues further that the Respondent directly expropriated the
Claimant's rights in the assets of Transener. The Claimant affirms that its rights
in Transener constitute an investment under the Treaty and that it had a clear
economic interest in the Concessions and the Contracts which were the assets of
Transener. The Claimant concludes that the destruction by the Respondent of
Transener and Transba’s transmission tariff and remuneration regimes constitute
a direct expropriation of the Claimant’s investment in the form of the rights in or
related to the Concession and the Contracts.

141. The Respondent, on the other hand, claims that the Emergency Law and its
effects on the Concession are covered by the doctrine of the police powers of the
State. To sustain its argument, the Respondent refers to the Harvard Draft
Convention on the International Responsibility of States for Injuries to Aliens of

22 Claimant's Reply, para. 384, citing Methanex v. United States of America (UNCITRAL Arbitration),

Final Award on Jurisdiction and Merits of August 3, 2005 [hereinafter, Methanex v. United States of
America].

144.

1961 (the Harvard Draft), the Saluka award and the writings of Francis Mann
where it is stated that a country has a right to devalue and that such devaluation
does not amount to a “taking” of property. According to the Respondent, the
mere loss of value of shares does not constitute an indirect expropriation and, in
any event, the Claimant has not suffered a total deprivation of its investment.

The Respondent rejects the use of the determination of expropriation of OPIC in
the Ponderosa case adduced by the Claimant since is not a determination by a
tribunal; OPIC is an organ of the United States Government and it applies
different rules with different objectives from those applied by the Tribunal.

The Respondent also rebuts the Claimant's argument of direct expropriation
questioning the Claimant’s alleged economic rights to the Transener’s
investments. The Respondent maintains that the Claimant uses the meaning of
assets in a way not recognized in the Treaty or Argentine law. The Respondent
explains that the term “assets” refers only to physical assets and not to the rights
which Claimant seeks to protect here. The Respondent argues that National
Grid had invested as shareholder and as such it may not claim an interest or right

in the contractual rights of another legal entity.

2. Considerations of the Tribunal

The Tribunal will dispose first of preliminary questions which have arisen in the
exchange of arguments of the Parties and then address the claims of direct and
indirect expropriation. First of all, the definition of “assets” protected under the
Treaty is broader than physical assets as Respondent has asserted in attempting

to rebut Claimant's argument of direct expropriation. Secondly, the Tribunal

55

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 58 of 133

145.

146.

30

considers that the determination of OPIC in the Ponderosa case is of limited
value as a precedent for the reasons adduced by the Respondent, namely, that it
is a decision of an organ of a government, not one arrived at by an independent
tribunal after hearing the parties.

The Tribunal is not persuaded that there has been a direct expropriation of the
Claimant's rights or interests in Transener. No formal right of property has been
transferred to the State or to other parties by the State. Deprivation of title to
property is inherent in a direct expropriation and none has been adduced or
proven in these proceedings. On the contrary, the Claimant retained title to its
shares and sold them. The Measures may or may not have destroyed its
investment but have not transferred ownership of it.*°

As regards indirect expropriation, the parties have argued extensively as to what
may or may not constitute indirect expropriation and in particular how much the
value of assets must be reduced and under which circumstances the exercise of
regulatory power may give rise to a right to compensation. The Tribunal will start
its analysis by considering the text of Article 5(1). This article provides for
compensated expropriation, whether direct or indirect, when the expropriation or
the measures that are tantamount to expropriation are for a public purpose
“related to the internal needs of that Contracting Party” and non-discriminatory.
The engagement of the parties in the Treaty is a negative engagement not to

nationalize, expropriate or subject investments of investors to measures having

As noted by the tribunal in Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic

(ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3) Award of May 22, 2007 [hereinafter, Enron v. Argentina], when faced
with a similar argument, it is difficult to see how certain actions may qualify as a creeping
expropriation and a direct expropriation simultaneously.

56

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 59 of 133

147.

148.

an equivalent effect, unless three conditions are met: public purpose, non-
discrimination and “prompt, adequate and effective compensation.”
It is clear from a reading of Article 5(1) that whether the party concerned had the
intent to expropriate or to nationalize in taking measures equivalent to either is
not a requirement. Article 5(1) is concerned only with measures having an effect
equivalent to nationalization or expropriation. Article 5(1) does not qualify
whether the measures are taken in the exercise of a Contracting Party regulatory
power or any other power a government may be entitled to exercise. The key
words for the Contracting Parties are “effect equivalent to.” The measures’ effect
needs to be tantamount to an expropriation or nationalization. The issue is
where to draw the line.
The Saluka tribunal, quoted extensively and approvingly by the Respondent,
concludes that international law,

“has yet to draw a bright and easily distinguishable line

between non-compensable regulations on the one hand and,

on the other, measures that have the effect of depriving

foreign investors of their investment and are thus unlawful

and compensable in international law.

It thus inevitably falls to the adjudicator to determine whether

particular conduct by a state ‘crosses the line’ that separates

valid regulatory activity from expropriation. Faced with the

question of when, how and at what point an otherwise valid

regulation becomes, in fact and effect, an unlawful

expropriation, international tribunals must consider the

circumstances in which the question arises. The context

within which an impugned measure is adopted and applied is
critical to the determination of its validity.”*'

149. The cases adduced by the Parties are helpful in guiding the Tribunal in this task.

In CME the tribunal referred to measures that “effectively neutralize the benefit of
the property of the foreign owner.”” Similarly in Lauder the tribunal refers to a
measure that effectively neutralizes the enjoyment of the property.** In Middle
East Cement the measures constituting indirect expropriation are described as
measures with the effect of depriving the investor of the use and benefit of his
investment.“ In Santa Elena we read that governmental interference “deprived
the owner of his rights or has made those rights practically useless,” and had
caused the irretrievable loss of “the practical and economic use of the
Property.”* Tecmed refers to radical deprivation of “the economical use and
enjoyment of its investments, as if the rights related thereto...had ceased to
exist.”*° Pope & Talbot finds that a particular interference with business activities
amounts to an expropriation if “that interference is sufficiently restrictive to
support a conclusion that the property has been ‘taken” from the owner and
refers for support to the Harvard Draft's definition, which requires interference

that “would justify an inference that the owner...will not be able to use, enjoy or

dispose of the property...,” and to the Restatement which speaks of “action that
is confiscatory, or that prevents, unreasonably interferes with, or unduly delays,
effective enjoyment of alien’s property.”*” The terms used in these cases convey
the effect that the measures concerned must have: neutralization, radical

deprivation, irretrievable loss, inability to use, enjoy or dispose of the property.

150. The number of combinations of possible measures which may produce such

effect is large and defies definition. The Respondent itself has found it useful to
refer in this case and in other cases -CMS, Enron- to the list of items described
in Pope & Talbot for purposes of determining whether indirect expropriation

existed:

“...the Investor remains in control of the Investment, it directs
the day-to-day operations of the Investment, and no officers
or employees of the Investment had _ been
detained...Canada does not supervise the work of the
officers or employees of the Investment, does not take any
of the proceeds of company sales (apart from taxation), does
not interfere with management or shareholders’ activities,
does not prevent the Investment from paying dividends to its
shareholders, does not interfere with the appointment of
directors or management and does not take any other
actions ousting the Investor from full ownership and control
of the Investment.”**

The tribunal in Enron found the list of measures listed in Pope & Talbot, which
had been invoked by the Respondent in that case, to be “representative of the

legal standard required to make a finding of indirect expropriation.”®°

151.

The Parties have also argued concerning the significance of the existence of
prior commitments for purposes of identifying the regulatory measures which
would give rise to a right to compensation. Judge Higgins commenting on the

Martini case stated that:

“In my view the right distinctions are here being drawn:
governments may indeed need to be able to act qua
government and in the public interest. That fact will prevent
specific performance (including restitution) from being
granted against them. But that is not to liberate them from
the obligation to compensate those with whom it has entered
into specific arrangements. That is the reasonable place to
strike the balance between the expectations of foreign
investors and the bona fide needs of governments to act in
the public interest.”

152. In less categorical terms and after a review of investment treaty cases Jan

Paulsson and Zachary Douglas concluded that:

“the prohibition against indirect expropriation should protect
legitimate expectations of the investor based on specific
undertakings or representations by the Host State upon
which the investor has reasonably relied. This is by no
means an exclusive test to be applied to all types of alleged
indirect expropriations in isolation of other relevant factors. It
is, nonetheless, a useful guiding principle that appears to
cover many of the situations that have come before the
modern investment treaty tribunals.””'

153. While this is a useful test and has been invoked by arbitral tribunals in cases

such as Methanex, it may not be conclusive since there may be situations where,

notwithstanding prior commitments, the regulatory effect may not be devastating

enough to constitute an indirect expropriation. Conversely, the value of an
investment may be lost through regulatory measures without any existence of
prior commitments and, under the Treaty, such effect on the investment would
give a right to compensation.

In the instant case, the Claimant continued to own its shares and could exercise
its rights as a shareholder and disposed of its investment by its own decision.
The value of its investment was diminished but not to the extent that it could be
considered worthless. For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent
did not expropriate indirectly the investment of the Claimant.

This conclusion finds support in the findings on indirect expropriation of other
tribunals which have so far decided claims arising out of the Argentine crisis. In
CMS, the tribunal reached its decision on the basis that the investor fully
controlled its investment, and the Government did not administer the day-to-day
operations of the company.” Following the checklist outlined in Pope & Talbot,
the Enron tribunal dismissed the indirect expropriation claim,** while the LG&E
tribunal considered that the claimants were not deprived of the right to enjoy their
investment, did not lose control of their shares in the licensees and “the effect of
the Argentine State’s actions has not been permanent on the value of the

Claimants’ shares, and Claimants’ investment has not ceased to exist.”

B. Fair AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT

1. Positions of the Parties

156. The Claimant notes that Article 2(2) does not define specifically the protections

provided and observes that this “omission reflects the widely accepted principle
that the fair and equitable treatment standard cannot be summarized in a precise
statement of [a] legal obligation."“* The Claimant then goes on to argue that,
based on recent case law, the fair and equitable treatment standard requires that
investors be treated in accordance with their legitimate expectations including the
maintenance of a stable and predictable investment environment. The Claimant
asserts that “a state violates the fair and equitable treatment standard when it
fails to respect the very assurances that it made to investors as an inducement to

invest and on which investors relied.”“*

157. According to the Claimant, this standard does not require proving bad faith in the

45

48

actions of the State and is separate from the customary international law
minimum standard of treatment of aliens. The Claimant observes that, unlike
other treaties, the Treaty does not refer to the international minimum standard of
the treatment of aliens, and that, if the parties had wanted to equate these two
concepts, they would have done so expressly. In any case, argues the Claimant,
even if the minimum standard of treatment did apply, it would require that the
Government respect the stability and predictability of the investment framework

as held by the CMS and Occidental tribunals.

Ibid., para. 297.

62

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 65 of 133

158. The Claimant recalls the statement by Minister Cavallo on the occasion of the

signature of the Treaty in London where he referred to the “legal certainty”
provided by the Treaty.*” Similarly, when the President of the Argentine Republic
presented the Treaty to the Congress he stated that “through [bilateral
investment treaties] states agree, while they are in force, to maintain certain
investment_regulations unchanged, in the hope of establishing _a stable and

confident climate to attract investment.”

159. The Claimant alleges that the Respondent breached this standard of protection

when it destroyed the remuneration regime provided for in the Regulatory
Framework. The stability of this regime was critical in the electricity transmission
sector and an absolutely necessary condition for Transener to obtain the required
long-term financing to improve, upgrade, maintain and expand the electricity
transmission infrastructure. The Claimant affirms that it on the basis of the
Respondent's promise of a stable investment environment that it decided initially

to invest in the Argentine Republic and, later, to expand on the initial investment.

160. The Claimant concludes by asserting that “the test of fundamental alterations of

47

48

49

the investment framework against /egitimate investor expectations in this
situation results in the Respondent's liability for breach of this standard of
treatment.” The Claimant adds that the Respondent also acted unfairly and
inequitably in forcing Transener and Transba to renegotiate and waive claims on

pain of rescission of their contracts.

50

The Respondent denies that it breached Article 2(2) of the Treaty and argues
that the standard embodied in the Treaty is the minimum standard of treatment of
aliens under international law. The Respondent adduces case law to show that,
even if the standard has evolved since Neer, the standard still has a high
threshold as expressed, for instance, in Genin: “Acts that would violate this
minimum standard would include acts showing a willful neglect of duty, an
insufficiency of action falling far below international standards, or even subjective
bad faith.”©°

The Respondent affirms that the process of contract renegotiation was
conducted in good faith with impartiality, consistency and transparency, while the
Claimant's conduct showed anything but good faith when it presented irrational
demands in the circumstances of the Argentine Republic thus evidencing the
Claimant's true objective to get rid of the investment.

The Respondent argues that the “fair” and “equitable” standard does not require
an absolute obligation to maintain a stable and foreseeable framework for the
investment in accordance with the legitimate expectations of the investors. The
concept of legitimate expectations does not have the reach in international law
that the Claimant contends. The investor must be aware of the political and
economic realities of the country in which it invests. Investors made investments
in the Argentine Republic because there was an opportunity to obtain a rate of

return higher that in other countries with more stable conditions.

64

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 67 of 133

164.

In any case, argues the Respondent, the Argentine Republic did not breach this
standard of treatment even if judged in accordance with the expansive
interpretation contended by the Claimant. There is no proof that the Respondent
acted unjustly or inequitably before 2002 and even thereafter the authorities
acted in good faith by initiating a process of renegotiation notwithstanding the
investor's assumption of the economic risk of the Concession. Furthermore, the
assessment of the Respondent’s conduct must take into account all
circumstances of the case.

On the breach of the just and equitable treatment standard, the Respondent
considers that definition of this standard is too broad and would be surprising to
the drafters of the Treaty. The Respondent refers to recent case law to support
its contention that the threshold for breaching this standard remains high. The
Respondent points out that, if this Tribunal were to find that the standard of
protection provided in the Treaty goes beyond the minimum international
standard, then it should apply the standard relying on objective criteria and taking
into account all the circumstances of the case.

The Respondent questions Claimant’s legitimate expectations in light of the
excessive price Claimant paid for the shares of Citelec, its increase in said
participation, the acquisition of Transba and the participation in the Fourth Line.
As recognized by the Claimant, the Respondent argues that the respect of the
legitimate expectations of an investor does not mean respecting all expectations
of an investor but only those which are based on specific representations or clear

commitments. The Respondent then argues that there is no proof of declarations

65

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 68 of 133

or clear commitments of the Respondent and that Claimant's legitimate
expectations need to be considered in the context of a legal framework that did
not provide Transener or Transba with absolute protection against the
devaluation of the currency. The measures taken by the Respondent were in
response to the economic crisis; it is illogical to suggest, first, that under
international law the State has a right to adopt emergency measures and then, at
the same time, to insist that investors not be prejudiced by such measures. The
Respondent acted in a proportionate and reasonable manner in response to the
crisis; a decision that such conduct breaches the standard of just and equitable
treatment under those circumstances would constitute unjustified interference
with a sovereign’s legitimate regulatory authority and contrary to the “high
measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of

domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders.”*

2. Considerations of the Tribunal

167. The Tribunal recalls that it has been established under the Treaty and is bound
by the terms of the Treaty, which it must interpret in accordance with Article 31 of
the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Hence, after first observing that
there is no reference to the minimum standard of treatment under international
law in the Treaty in contrast to the language of NAFTA, the Tribunal will proceed

to examine the ordinary meaning of the terms “fair” and “equitable.”

51 §.D. Myers, Inc. v. Canada (UNCITRAL Arbitration), Partial Award of November 13, 2000 [hereinafter
S.D. Myers v. Canada], para.272. Quoted in the Rejoinder, para. 567 (Legal Authorities LA RA-102).

66

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 69 of 133

168. In their ordinary meaning, the term “fair? means “just,” “even-handed,”

“unbiased,” “legitimate,” “reasonable.” Equitable is defined as “fair” and
‘just,”™ “just, fair, and right, in consideration of the facts and circumstances of the
individual case.” While the definition of each term uses the other and
underlines their relationship, two aspects stand out: the idea of even-handedness

and the need to consider all the facts and circumstances of an individual case.

169. The MTD award refers to the statement of Judge Schwebel to the effect that “the

meaning of what is fair and equitable is defined when that standard is applied to
a set of specific facts.” The fact-specific nature of the standard has prompted the

tribunal in Saluka to say that:

“Whatever the merits of this controversy between the parties
may be, it appears that the difference between the Treaty
standard laid down in Article 3.1 and the customary
minimum standard, when applied to the specific facts of a
case, may well be more apparent than real. To the extent
that the case law reveals different formulations of the
relevant thresholds, an in-depth analysis may well
demonstrate that they could be explained by the contextual
and factual differences of the cases in which the standards
have been applied.”*

170. We therefore move to consider the context in which the terms fair and equitable

are used in this case. These terms are used in a treaty which the State parties
had signed for a purpose, namely, to promote and protect investments. As
indicated in the Preamble, this purpose is “to create favorable conditions for

greater investment by investors of one State in the territory of the other State.”
Another consideration of the Contracting Parties in the Preamble is “the
encouragement and reciprocal protection under international agreement of such
investments will be conducive to the stimulation of individual business initiative
and will increase prosperity in both States.” Then Article 2 of the Treaty under
the title of “Promotion and Protection of Investment” provides first of all that
“Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favorable conditions for
investors of the other Contracting Party to invest capital in its territory....”. This
undertaking is followed in the next paragraph by the commitment to accord at all
times fair and equitable treatment to investors. Therefore, the obligation of fair
and equitable treatment is placed squarely in the context of an obligation to
“encourage and create” favorable conditions for investors. In this context, it
seems a logical consequence that the Contracting Parties would choose not to
use limitations to such treatment such as found in the expression “minimum
treatment standard under international law.”
Early in the era of BITs, Francis Mann commented on the British BITs:

“the terms ‘fair and equitable treatment’ envisage conduct

which goes far beyond the minimum standard and afford

protection to a greater extend and according to a much more

objective standard than any previously employed form of

words. A tribunal would not be concerned with a minimum,

maximum or average standard. lt will have to decide

whether in all the circumstances the conduct in issue is fair

and equitable or unfair and inequitable. No standard defined

by other words is likely to be material. The terms are to be

172. In applying them, the Tribunal recalls that the Claimant has commented on the
imprecision of the standard. On that point the tribunal in Enron refers to a similar
observation of the respondent and observes that the standards of treatment have
gradually evolved over the centuries and that this evolution is “for the most part
the outcome of a case by case determination by courts and tribunals.” In the
specific case of “fair and equitable treatment,” this is a relatively recent
occurrence.*

173. A review of the case law adduced by the Parties shows that fair and equitable
treatment is considered an objective standard that does not require bad faith by
the State.®* It also shows that this standard protects the reasonable expectations
of the investor at the time it made the investment and which were based on
representations, commitments or specific conditions offered by the State
concerned. Thus, treatment by the State should “not affect the basic
expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the
investment.”® CME speaks of “evisceration of the arrangements in reliance upon
which the foreign investor was induced to invest.” Waste Management

considered it “relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by

the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.”” In the words

of the CMS tribunal:

“It is not a question of whether the legal framework might
need to be frozen as it can always evolve and be adapted to
changing circumstances, but neither is it a question of
whether the framework can be dispensed with altogether
when specific commitments to the contrary have been made.
The law of foreign investment and its protection has been
developed with the specific objective of avoiding such
adverse legal effects.”

174. Similarly, after a review of arbitral awards, the Enron tribunal concluded that:

“What seems to be essential...is that these expectations derived from the
conditions that were offered by the State to the investor at the time of the
investment and that such conditions were relied upon by the investor when

deciding to invest.”

175. The protection of investor expectations has been made subject to two significant

qualifications: first, that the investor should not be shielded from the ordinary
business risk of the investment and, second, that the investor's expectations
must have been reasonable and legitimate in the context in which the investment
was made. In LG&E, for example, the tribunal considered that “the investor's fair
expectations cannot fail to consider parameters such business risk or industry's
regular patterns.”® In Saluka, the tribunal was of the view that “the scope of the

Treaty’s protection of foreign investment against unfair and inequitable treatment

cannot exclusively be determined by foreign investors’ subjective motivations and
considerations. Their expectations, in order for them to be protected, must rise
to the level of legitimacy and reasonableness in light of the circumstances.”*
The tribunal then went on to say that:

“No investor may reasonably expect that the circumstances

prevailing at the time the investment is made remain totally

unchanged. In order to determine whether frustration of the

foreign investor's expectations was justified and reasonable,

the host State’s legitimate right subsequently to regulate

domestic matters in the public interest must be taken into

consideration as well.”*”
The Claimant made its investment at a time when, after a severe economic crisis,
the Respondent was trying to offer a different image to investors. The BITs were
part of this effort to attract foreign investment. As stated by the Argentine
President when it presented the Treaty to Congress for ratification: “Es preciso
no perder de vista el objetivo principal de este tipo de acuerdos, que es incitar a
la inversi6n genuina y productiva. A través de ellos, los Estados aceptan
mantener inalterables durante su vigencia ciertas normas de tratamiento de las
inversiones, con lo que se espera establecer un clima de estabilidad y confianza
para atraer inversiones.”®
More specifically, the Respondent solicited the investments in the power sector
internationally. It is disingenuous for the Respondent now to rely on the
disclaimers in the prospectus in order to distance itself from the information given

therein. The prospectus was prepared by respectable bankers on behalf of the

179.

Respondent and key Argentine government officials participated prominently in
the road show. If information in the prospectus had been incorrect or misleading,
the Tribunal has no doubt that the Respondent would have had the prospectus
changed accordingly.

The evidence before the Tribunal shows that the Claimant relied on the key
elements of the Regulatory Framework (subsequently dismantled by the
Measures). In assessing the opportunity to invest in the Argentine Republic, it
took into account the protections provided by the Treaty.

It is the conclusion of the Tribunal that the Respondent breached the standard of
fair and equitable treatment because: (a) it fundamentally changed the legal
framework on the basis of which the Respondent itself had solicited investments
and the Claimant had made them, (b) no meaningful negotiations took place for
the two years that passed between the adoption of the Measures and the sale of
Transener’s shares by the Claimant, and (c) the Respondent required that
Transener renounce to the legal remedies it may have as a condition to re-
negotiate the Concession.

This determination by the Tribunal, however, must be qualified in time. The
Tribunal’s conclusion that the Respondent has been in breach of the Treaty
cannot ignore the context in which the Measures were taken. The determination
of the Tribunal must take into account all the circumstances and in so doing
cannot be oblivious to the crisis that the Argentine Republic endured at that time.
What is fair and equitable is not an absolute parameter. What would be unfair

and inequitable in normal circumstances may not be so in a situation of an

72

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 75 of 133

181.

economic and social crisis. The investor may not be totally insulated from
situations such as the ones the Argentine Republic underwent in December 2001
and the months that followed. For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the
breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard did not occur at the time the
Measures were taken on January 6, 2002 but on June 25, 2002 when the
Respondent required that companies such as the Claimant renounce to the legal
remedies they may have recourse as a condition to re-negotiate the

Concession.”

C. PROTECTION AND CONSTANT SECURITY

1. Positions of the Parties

The Claimant has alleged that by taking the Measures the Respondent withdrew
the protection and security previously granted to its investment. It is the Claimant
submission that the general duty to protect investments is linked to fair and
equitable treatment. The Claimant notes that the sentence “and shall enjoy
protection and constant security in the territory of the other Contracting Party”
follows without any punctuation after the first sentence of Article 2(2) of the
Treaty: “Investments of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be

accorded fair and equitable treatment.”

182. The Claimant argues that while this standard of protection has been mainly

69

applied in situations of physical protection of real and tangible property, such
protection may extend to other circumstances. In this regard the Claimant refers

to a study by UNCTAD where it is stated that:

Exhibit C-84. Decreto 1090/02.

73

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 76 of 133

“As the term ‘investment’ has expanded to include a broader
variety of intangible forms of property, the range of
protection that an investor may argue is required by the
obligation of full protection and security has potentially
expanded. For example, where ‘investment’ includes
intellectual property, an investor may contend that the
obligation to exercise reasonable care to protect intellectual
property against private infringement may require making
available some form of remedy against those who infringe
copyrights or patents.””

183. The Claimant also refers to APPL, AMT and CME to sustain that constant
protection and security embodies an objective standard of vigilance so that the
due diligence or reasonable care required will depend on the circumstances of
each case. At a minimum, however, the Claimant asserts that this standard is
clearly infringed by “government measures that fail to apply the rules specifically
designed to govern and protect the investment.””

184. The Respondent disputes the interpretation of “constant protection and security”
presented by the Claimant. The Respondent argues that the meaning and scope
of this obligation is more limited than the Claimant's interpretation. In any case,
the Respondent asserts, the facts of the case do not support a separate finding
that the Respondent breached this obligation whether its content is interpreted
narrowly or broadly.

185. The Respondent’s view is that the case law does not support the meaning
attributed by the Claimant to “protection and constant security.” In all cases —

ELSI, AAPL, AMT, Wena and Rankin- this clause is understood to refer to

physical disturbance or occupation. As for CME, the Respondent questions its

186.

187.

value as a precedent since in that case the award was not unanimous and the
reasoning of the tribunal was confined to a single paragraph.

The Respondent draws the conclusion that protection and constant security may
not be invoked in relation to the obligation of fair and equitable treatment
because, if the guarantee is limited to physical interference, the active protection
is also limited to such interference. Accordingly, the Respondent submits that
the obligation of the State to be diligent in providing “protection and security” is
applicable only in the circumstances of physical interference does not extend to

the protection of contractual obligations.

2. Considerations of the Tribunal

In Article 2(2), the obligation to protect and provide constant security of the
Contracting Parties is linked to the fair and equitable treatment standard. As
noted in the UNCTAD study referred to by the Claimant, this obligation has
typically been applied in situations involving physical threats or destruction.
However, Article 2(2) does not provide for such limitation nor limits the protection
to physical assets. Given that these terms are closely associated with fair and
equitable treatment, which is not limited to such physical situations, and in the
context of the protection of investments broadly defined to include intangible
assets, the Tribunal finds no rationale for limiting the application of a substantive
protection of the Treaty to a category of assets —physical assets— when it was not
restricted in that fashion by the Contracting Parties.

As for the case law, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the CME findings may be

dismissed because the award was decided by majority or because the discussion

75

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 78 of 133

of the issue was not lengthy. The other cases adduced by the Respondent do
not deal with the question before this Tribunal. They all deal with questions of
disturbances, rebellion, physical threats, destruction of company assets, but
none considered whether the scope of the protection and constant security
obligation embraced non-physical situations. In the cases of AAPL and AMT the
issue was whether the obligation was of an absolute character or simply an
obligation of due diligence of the State to protect aliens under customary
international law, a matter different from the issue in the instant case. Rankin is
also not apposite. This claim concerned compensation for lost property and
property rights arising from alleged wrongful expulsion from Iran. The case was
dismissed because the claimant could not prove that his departure from Iran was
caused by the alleged wrongful acts of the Iranian government. At no time the
tribunal in that case considered the extent of the obligation to provide “constant
protection and security” beyond the events of the Iranian revolution. The same
comment applies to Wena. As to Enron, the tribunal rejected “the argument
made in general about a possible lack of protection and security in the broader
ambit of the legal and political system” because such argument was “not proven
or even adequately developed.””

189. The Tribunal concludes that the phrase “protection and constant security” as
related to the subject matter of the Treaty does not carry with it the implication
that this protection is inherently limited to protection and security of physical

assets. This conclusion is reinforced by the inclusion of this commitment in the

7 Enron v. Argentina Award, para. 287.

76

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 79 of 133

191.

192.

same article of the Treaty as the language on fair and equitable treatment. In
applying this standard of protection to the facts of the instant case, the Tribunal
finds that the changes introduced in the Regulatory Framework by the Measures,
which effectively dismantled it, and the uncertainty reigning during the two years
preceding the sale of its shares in Transener, with respect to any possible
compensation on account of the impact of the Measures on Claimant's
investment, are contrary to the protection and constant security which the
Respondent agreed to provide for investments under the Treaty.

The Tribunal concludes that the Respondent breached its obligation to provide
protection and constant security on the same date as it breached its undertaking

to treat investments fairly and equitably, namely, June 25, 2002.

. UNREASONABLE AND DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES

1. Positions of the Parties

The Claimant argues that the Measures were unreasonable because they
dismantled the entire remuneration regime of the electricity transmission industry,
were contrary to the legitimate expectations created by the Regulatory
Framework, destroyed the value of the investment in the circumstances in which
the guarantees given in the Regulatory Framework were designed to afford such
protection, and were not even a legitimate and proportionate attempt at fair
burden sharing.

The Claimant submits that measures may be discriminatory even if differential
treatment is not based on nationality or involves different sectors of the economy,

or when their effect, but not necessarily their intent, is discriminatory. The

77

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 80 of 133

193.

194.

Claimant alleges that the energy sector has been discriminated against as
compared to other sectors of the economy. The Claimant recounts how the
banking sector was compensated for losses deriving from the asymmetrical
pesification, how the company that manages the concession of the navigation
channel in the Parana River was allowed to increase international transportation
tariffs, and how the energy sector was sacrificed for the benefit of manufacturers
and consumers. The Claimant refers to statements of the Minister of General
Planning, Public Investment and Services, its Chief of Cabinet and ENRE to
show government awareness of this unfair transfer of resources from one sector
of the economy to others.

The Respondent affirms that there were no unjustified or discriminatory
measures taken by the Respondent. Transener and Transba were a natural
monopoly and it was impossible to give them the same treatment as other
operators. It argues that the Measures could not be discriminatory because the
Respondent acted in good faith and without any intention to discriminate.
Furthermore, the term “unjustified” is related to arbitrary and the concept of
arbitrariness has been established by the ICJ in ELS/ and by arbitral practice in
Genin and Noble Ventures. \n the latter case, the Respondent points out that the
tribunal found the measures were reasonable and well founded in the context of
the social and economic collapse of the company concerned.

In its Reply, the Claimant submits that these arguments are irrelevant. The
comparison of measures is not limited to identical monopolistic sectors and

measures may be discriminatory even if not intentionally so. The Claimant points

78

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 81 of 133

195.

196.

197.

out that the case law related to arbitrariness relied on by the Respondent is
misplaced as part of the discrimination argument because the Treaty speaks of
unreasonable and discriminatory measures, not arbitrary measures. In any case,
according to the Claimant, the Measures were unreasonable and arbitrary.

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent questions the distinction between “unjustified”
and “arbitrary” put forward by the Claimant. The Respondent argues that there is
a close link between unjustified and arbitrary and rejects the assertion that the
measures taken were arbitrary. The Measures were of a general nature, they
applied to anyone irrespective of nationality. There can be only discrimination if
those in like situations are treated differently. The measures to be discriminatory
must be taken with the intention to cause injury, the differentiation must be

without reason —unjustified- and the measures must inflict real damage.

2. Considerations of the Tribunal

Under Article 2(2) of the Treaty, “[nJeither Contracting Party shall in any way
impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of
investors of the other Contracting Party.” This provision is complemented by
Article 3 on national treatment and treatment not less favorable than the
treatment accorded to investments of investors who are nationals of third parties.
The first issue for the Tribunal is to determine whether “unreasonable” and
“arbitrary” have distinct or similar meanings. The Black’s Law Dictionary defines
“unreasonable” as “irrational; foolish; unwise; absurd; silly; preposterous;

senseless; stupid.” The same source defines “arbitrary” variously as something

79

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 82 of 133

198.

199.

done “capriciously or at pleasure,” “without adequate determining principle,”
“non-rational” or “not done or acting according to reason or judgment.” It is the
view of the Tribunal that the plain meaning of the terms “unreasonable” and
“arbitrary” is substantially the same in the sense of something done capriciously,
without reason.

It is clear from the evidence before the Tribunal that the Measures were taken by
the Respondent in the context of an unfolding crisis. They may have
contradicted commitments made to the Claimant but each one of them provided
the reasons why it was taken. As for discrimination, the Tribunal first notes that
Article 2(2) does not limit discrimination to discrimination on the basis of
nationality and may cover measures based on other grounds. On the other
hand, Article 3 provides separate specific language to ensure that investors of
either Contracting Party will not, because of their nationality, be treated less
favorably than other foreign investors.

The thrust of the Claimant's argument is that the public utilities were
discriminated because they were owned mostly by non-voting foreign investors in
Argentine elections. The Tribunal observes that the Measures affected foreign
and local investors alike. The Tribunal further notes that Transener itself was at
the time owned in part by Argentine nationals. Therefore, it is the conclusion of
the Tribunal that the investment of the Claimant has not been discriminated
against on the basis of the nationality of part-owners of Transener.

As to the other grounds of discrimination alleged by the Claimant, i.e., different

treatment of the export and banking sectors and certain fluvial transport, they

80

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 83 of 133

201.

raise the issue of what are the limits of the comparison. Should the comparison
be limited to the treatment of other entities in the same sector or is it appropriate
to extend it across sectors? The tribunal in S.D. Myers took the view that “the
word ‘sector’ has a wide connotation that includes the concepts of ‘economic
sector’ and ‘business sector,””* which seems to indicate the possibility of cross-
sector comparisons. In this respect and interpreting the meaning of “in like
situations,” the tribunal in Occidental held that such phrase could not “be
interpreted in the narrow sense advanced by Ecuador as the purpose of national
treatment is to protect investors as compared to local producers, and this cannot
be done by addressing exclusively the sector in which that particular activity is
undertaken.” While these cases show the possibility of making comparisons
across sectors, at least as such term is defined in S.D. Myers, the elements that
may justify reasonable and objective differentiation are bound to be more
numerous in cross-sector comparisons and, hence, the discrimination more
difficult to establish. Furthermore, any such comparison needs to take into
account “circumstances that would justify governmental regulations that treat
them differently in order to protect the public interest.””

Having considered the context of the alleged discrimination and the specific
circumstances of the power sector in the Argentine Republic at the time the
Measures were taken, the Tribunal considers that there is not sufficient evidence

to establish that discrimination took place. No doubt the export sector in the

S.D. Myers v. Canada, Partial Award, para. 250.

Argentine Republic benefited from the devaluation. This was to be expected;
since the intent to favor exports is usually one of the main reasons underlying the
decision of a country to devalue its currency. There is also no doubt that in such
circumstances certain economic sectors will win and others will lose. It is not for
the Tribunal to reestablish the ex ante situation. In any case, the Respondent
has also explained that it took measures to withhold the foreign exchange of the
exporters, a matter which has not been pursued in much detail by either party.
As to the banking and fluvial transport sectors, their characteristics are so distinct
from the power sector that the Tribunal finds that there are rational policy

reasons for treating these sectors differently.

. THE UMBRELLA CLAUSE

1. Positions of the Parties

The Claimant raised the issue of the breach of the so-called umbrella clause only
at the time it submitted its Reply. The argument of the Claimant relies on Article
2(2) of the Treaty, which in its last sentence provides “Each Contracting Party
shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments
of investors of the other Contracting Party.” The Claimant refers to the broad
interpretation of this type of clause by the SGS v. Philippines tribunal and
submits that it covers all investment-specific commitments beyond those
provided in contracts. Furthermore, the Claimant finds support for this argument
in Eureko and LG&E, which dealt with a similar situation in the Argentine

Republic.

82

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 85 of 133

203.

204.

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent points out that this is a new argument which
should have been made earlier and hence it is out of time, and that contractual
claims need to be submitted to the local courts. According to the Respondent, to
follow the Claimant's interpretation would mean that a breach of any obligation of
the State would be a breach of the Treaty and would render the rest of the Treaty
meaningless. In any case, the Respondent has not breached this provision of
the Treaty because the claims are not based on specific commitments in a non-

existent investment agreement.

2. Considerations of the Tribunal

The Tribunal concurs with the Respondent that the allegations made by the
Claimant under this heading are out of time. Under the Arbitration Rules, Article
18(2)(c), the Statement of Claim must contain the points at issue. The breach of
the umbrella clause was not raised by the Claimant when it filed its Statement of
Claim. The general reference to the breach of the standards of protection under
Article 2 of the Treaty without further specific allegations based on the umbrella
clause is not sufficient to permit the Tribunal to find that the Statement of Claim
met that requirement. Therefore, the Tribunal will not consider the claim of the

Claimant under this heading.

STATE OF NECESSITY

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

In the hypothetical case that the Tribunal might find that the Respondent had
breached the Treaty by adopting the Measures, the Respondent argues that its

conduct was licit and exempt of responsibility because the Measures were taken

83

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 86 of 133

206.

207.

in response to a state of necessity. The Respondent bases this defense on the
cases of the Neptunus, Compania de Ferrocarriles de Venezuela, the Russian
Indemnity, Dickinson Car Wheel Company, Société Commerciale de Belgique,
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project and Legal Consequences of the Construction of a
Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Respondent notes that its
counterpart to the Treaty has itself relied on this defense in the cases of the
Caroline and the Torre Canyon.

The Respondent then refers to the conditions set forth in Article 25 of the Draft
Articles for the admissibility of the necessity defense. In Seriatim the
Respondent addresses each of these conditions. First, the Respondent alleges
that it did not contribute to the state of necessity. It argues that such contribution
has to be substantive since in a situation of economic collapse one can always
find some measures that could be blamed for contributing to the crisis. A strict
interpretation of this requirement would render the possibility of claiming the
necessity defense worthless. In this case, the Argentine crisis was created by an
explosive cocktail of external factors such as the increase in the dollar rate of
interest, collapse of emerging markets, devaluation of the Brazilian currency, fall
of prices of exported goods, etc. The Respondent had no participation or an
insignificant participation in these developments and clearly had no intention to
provoke a crisis of which the Argentine Republic is the main victim.

Second, the Respondent argues that the measures it took were the only way to
address an essential interest in the face of serious and imminent danger. The

Respondent adduces the opinions of distinguished economists that the

84

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 87 of 133

208.

209.

210.

211.

pesification was the right manner to address the crisis, and contends that the
favorable evolution of the economy since the later part of 2002 shows that the
measures taken were proportionate and reasonable in the context of the
emergency suffered by the country.

Thirdly, no essential interest of the State counterparty of the Treaty or of the
international community as a whole has been seriously affected. The
Respondent explains that the purely patrimonial interests at play, the context in
which they have been affected and the non-discriminatory nature of the
measures taken cannot constitute a violation of the rights of the State
counterpart, which in no case has made this argument.

Fourthly, as already explained earlier, the foreign investors have not been treated
differently from the national investors and the Claimant has been treated like all
other companies which have invested in the electric power sector.

Finally, there is no provision in the Treaty which eliminates or restricts the
necessity defense. On the contrary, Article 4 of the Treaty foresees and
regulates one of the instances which may occur in a state of necessity.

In its Reply, the Claimant contests that the conduct of the Respondent may be
excused under its self-proclaimed emergency, either under Article 4 of the Treaty
or the necessity defense. It is the view of the Claimant that a State may not
avoid international responsibility by pleading emergency rule under its domestic
law, even if such excuse were condoned by its Constitution. It is also the view of
the Claimant that Article 4 of the Treaty is limited to cases of physical destruction

of property caused by force and in circumstances of armed conflict. The

85

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 88 of 133

212.

Claimant contends the Respondent’s position makes a mockery of the very
notion of emergency which by definition is a temporary state of affairs which
involves a danger that arises unexpectedly and requires urgent action.
According to the Claimant, the Respondent has misconceived the necessity
doctrine under international law, which, in addition, is a defense that cannot be
invoked against a United Kingdom investor due to the consistent objection to
such defense by the United Kingdom, aside from the fact that the Respondent
cannot make out its constitutive elements. The Claimant considers it
preposterous that the Respondent's continuous allegation of a state of necessity
while, at the same time, prepays in cash its debt to the International Monetary
Fund of US$9.5 billion.

As regards Article 4, the Claimant argues that as recognized in AAPL, the aim of
such provision is limited and refers to instances of compensation afforded to
domestic and third-party investors. Contrary to the Respondent's contention, the
Claimant looks in vain in the text of Article 4 of the Treaty for any exculpatory
language. Said article lacks the language of Article XI of the US-Argentina BIT:
“This Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures
necessary for the maintenance of public order [...] or the protection of its own
essential security interests.” Article 4 of the Treaty does not preclude but affirms
certain advantages to qualifying investors. The absence of such clause is
consistent with the United Kingdom’s refusal to accept the necessity defense

under international law.

86

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 89 of 133

213. The Claimant finds that its interpretation of Article 4 of the Treaty is confirmed in
CMS where the tribunal dismissed the Respondent's submission and held that
the plain meaning of the article in question was to provide a floor for the investor:
“The Article does not derogate from the Treaty rights but rather ensures that any
measures directed at offsetting or minimizing losses will be applied in a non-
discriminatory manner.””® According to the Claimant, this provision created an
entitlement to compensation where none would otherwise exist or simply, as held
in AAPL, confirming an entitlement to compensation that arises under other
provisions of the Treaty. Also according to the Claimant, this reading of AALP is
confirmed in AMT, where the tribunal held that this provision reinforces the
engagement of the State to ensure the protection and security of the
investments.

214. Then the Claimant places Article 4 in the context of the Treaty and explains that
Articles 2(2) and 5(1) contain unqualified obligations with no reference to Article
4. Article 2(2) requires fair and equitable treatment “at all times.” There is no
connection between Article 4 and the other two articles; Article 4, therefore, has
an entirely different function.

215. The Claimant argues further that Article 4 is in the nature of provisions which
refer to “war and civil disturbance clauses” or “losses due to war” clauses. This
is clear also in the case of AAPL relied on by the Respondent. The term
“national emergency” is interposed between words which refer to circumstances

of physical strife and read in its proper context “unmistakably indicates a

78 Reply, para. 474.

87

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 90 of 133

nationwide situation of physical conflict and insurrection of such proportions as to
constitute an emergency. Article 4 of the Treaty refers to losses directly
occasioned by action taken in such an emergency -i.e., forcibly action— and not
to regulatory measures taken to address political and economic difficulties.”””

216. The Claimant also refers to a 1998 UNCTAD report which shows clearly that the
term “national emergency” may not refer to economic situations. This study
explains that:

“The inclusion of a provision on compensation for losses by
war and civil disturbance in BITs is justified because
situations of war or civil war are often exceptions to
insurance contracts (or may need specific coverage) and are
often treated differently from government action in time of
peace. Requisition by the army in time of war may not be
covered by provisions on expropriation in normal
circumstances.”

217. The Claimant further alleges that the destruction of its investment is not a loss
“wing to a state of emergency.” The Claimant explains that it does not complain
of any losses caused by the economic situation in the Argentine Republic; its
claims are specifically related to the Measures and, therefore, Article 4 is not
relevant to the Claimant's loss.

218. The Claimant argues that the Respondent has paid compensation in some form
to other investors and not to Transba or Transener and, hence, if Article 4 were

in any way applicable, the result would be to extend to the Claimant's investment

the same treatment rather than to exonerate the Respondent from responsibility.

221.

The Claimant contends that, even if the Tribunal were to accept the
Respondent's views on the meaning of Article 4 of the Treaty, it is entitled to
receive treatment not less favorable than other investors protected by BITs under
the MFN clause of the Treaty. In this respect, the Claimant draws the attention of
the Tribunal to the Spain-Argentina BIT which does not include a clause similar
to Article 4. Accordingly, this Tribunal should disregard Article 4 to the extent
that it might in any way lessen the protection afforded to the Claimant and its
investment.

The Claimant then turns to the plea of necessity argued by the Respondent.
First, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent does not argue that it was
objectively impossible to respect the commitments accorded to its investment but
that the circumstances gave it a right to ignore these commitments. As stated by
the ICJ in the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project case, the ground of necessity as a
basis for precluding wrongfulness can only be accepted on an exceptional basis.
It is the view of the Claimant that the Respondent must prove the necessity that it
has invoked and the standard of proof is higher than the balance of probabilities
test.

The Claimant reviews the jurisprudence on the state of necessity and explains
that, despite the ICJ’s express recognition that Article 25 of the Draft Articles is
expressive of international law, in Gabcikovo-Nagymaros and the Wall in
Occupied Palestine the defense failed on the facts. The Claimant points out that
the same fate was met by the plea of necessity in CMS and Enron. In the

Russian Indemnity, the parties agreed that in certain circumstances international

89

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 92 of 133

222.

223.

224.

law permits the necessity defense but the tribunal also dismissed that plea on the
facts. In Socobelge and the Dickinson Car Wheel Company the plea of necessity
was obiter dicta; and in the French Company of the Venezuelan Railroads the
claim was dismissed because the acts on which the claim was based were not
attributable to the State.
The Claimant notes that the Respondent has failed to refer to the Serbian Loans
case where the PClJ held that:

“The economic dislocations caused by the war did not

release the debtor State [from the payment of bonds],

although they may present equities which doubtless will

receive appropriate consideration in the negotiations and —if

resorted to— the arbitral determination for which Article II of

the Special Agreement provides.”
From this holding the Claimant draws the consequence that, if the Serbian
government was not excused from economic dislocations caused by war, then, a
fortiori, it should be clear that the economic and social upheaval experienced by

the Argentine Republic in 2001 and 2002 does not excuse the Respondent from

complying with its international obligations.

The Claimant further points out that the Respondent fails to mention the Orinoco
case which confirms that necessity may excuse the breach of an international
obligation but compensation, nevertheless, needs to be paid for the breach.
Furthermore, in CMS the tribunal recognized that the plea of necessity does not
provide a license for a State to pass on the cost of necessity to an innocent party.
The Claimant argues that the necessity defense has to fail ab initio because the

international obligation breached does not permit the invocation of necessity

90

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 93 of 133

unless the invoking State has not contributed to the state of necessity. The
Claimant contends that Articles 2(2) and 5(1) are intended to protect investors
precisely in times of economic emergency and that the object and purpose of the
Treaty prevail over any plea of necessity as accepted in CMS which dismissed
the plea on facts similar to those invoked by the Respondent in this case.
Furthermore, the commitments made to the Claimant were designed to shield the
investor from precisely the kind of economic and monetary emergency now
claimed by the Respondent. In support of its allegation the Claimant refers to the
Himpurna case and the commentary of the ILC on Article 25(2)(a) of the Draft
Articles.

225. Then the Claimant addresses the issue of the contribution of the Respondent to
bring about the alleged emergency situation. It is the Claimant’s view that the
Respondent admits that it contributed to the emergency situation as recognized
by CMS which concluded that “government policies and their shortcomings
significantly contributed to the crisis while exogenous factors did fuel additional
difficulties they do not exempt the Respondent from its responsibility in the
matter.”

226. The Respondent claimed that foreign financial markets should have foreseen the
risk of an economic shock and that it obviously had no intention to create a
situation in which the Respondent itself was the primary victim. As regards the
first point, the Claimant considers that this argument lacks merit in the context of

the necessity plea and that the Government, which was even better placed to

229.

foresee the risk, did not identify it. The Claimant also dismisses the second point
because it is not a matter of the Respondent's intentions but a purely objective
question.

The Claimant alleges that mere help or contribution to the situation of necessity
is sufficient and it points out that the ICJ dismissed the plea upon finding that
Hungary had “helped, by act or omission, to bring” about the alleged situation of
necessity.

While it is the Claimant's submission that as a matter of law and fact the
Respondent is barred from invoking the plea of necessity, even if the
Respondent were able to make such a plea it would have to satisfy the strict
requirements of Article 25(1). The Claimant alleges that the Respondent has not
met them. The Claimant contends that it is impossible for the Respondent to
show that the Measures were the only means available to face a “grave and
imminent peril.”. The Respondent had other options and chose, instead, to place
an unfair burden on public utilities, most of which were controlled by foreign
enterprises.

The Claimant denies that there was a “grave and imminent peril” to the Argentine
Republic’s society and institutions. The difficulties in 2001 and 2002 were the
result of chronic economic problems and the culmination of a process of decline;
and even at its worst, when put in perspective, the crisis is not harsher than the
crisis endured by Indonesia in 1998 when the rupee was devalued by 80%. The
Claimant points out that institutions and social fabric survived the crisis intact.

The Measures were not taken in response to public protests but the other way

92

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 95 of 133

around; public protests had their origin in measures taken by the Respondent
which exacerbated the situation. As stated in an IMF study “Especially damaging
was the government's announcement on February 3 [2003] that bank’s assets
and liabilities would be subject to asymmetric ‘pesoization.”® According to the
Claimant, in a few months at the end of 2001 and early 2002 the Argentine
Republic’s institutions and population faced “the results of several years of
misguided economic policies and chronic problems that had been allowed to
fester,”*' but there was no threat to the existence of the Argentine Republic as a
nation and its institutions continued to function. The unemployment and poverty

indices which rose alarmingly in 2001 and 2002 reversed rapidly after the crisis.

230. In any event, argues the Claimant, a plea of necessity operates only temporarily.

80

81

82

While the Measures remained in force, the President of the Argentine Republic
has stated that economic recovery began in the second quarter of 2002. In view
of the strong recovery, the Respondent finds itself in the unseemly position of
advertising its continuing growth since 2002 for the purpose of attracting fresh
foreign investment, insisting all the while, for other purposes, that it finds itself in
a state of necessity. According to the Claimant, the “emergency” is maintained
solely to justify continuation of the Measures against foreign investors in the
public services: “Argentina's primary consideration was (and continues to be) to
minimize domestic political and economic cost, at the expense of (non-voting)

foreign investors like National Grid.”*

The Claimant points out that international tribunals have required a high burden
of proof to establish successfully that measures taken to safeguard an essential
interest against a grave and imminent peril were the only means available. It is
the contention of the Claimant that reasonable alternatives to the Measures were
open to the Respondent. The very purpose of the dollar-calculated remuneration
was to insulate Transener, Transba and their shareholders from the impact of
future decisions to abandon the peso:dollar parity. The Claimant contests the
logic of the Respondent’s argument that, if convertibility became inevitable, then
it necessarily followed that public-service tariffs needed to be pesified and frozen
at their nominal rates. The Claimant points out, for example, that the
Government did not intervene to regulate or subsidize basic consumer goods.
The Claimant observes that “Argentina asks the Tribunal to rely exclusively on its
own self-serving and unsupported assertions, without inquiring what other
measures could have been adopted instead of those that were actually
adopted.” According to the Claimant,

“the Measures were designed without any regard for the

catastrophic impact that they would have on Transener and

its shareholders. Rather than trying to protect vulnerable

citizens, the Measures were intended to cross-subsidize

Argentine producers and industrial consumers, and so revive

Argentina’s economy at the expense of foreign investors like

National Grid —and at no cost for Argentina. On this basis

alone, the Measures can find no foundation in ILC Article
25."

233.

The Claimant further argues that in accordance with Article 27 of the Draft
Articles, even an appropriate declaration of necessity brings about an
accompanying obligation to make full compensation for the non-compliance with
the international obligation concerned. The Claimant takes issue with the finding
on necessity by the LG&E tribunal and contends that it is irrelevant because it is
based on Article XI of the US-Argentina BIT which has no equivalent in the
Treaty and underlines that the Respondent may not rely on the customary law
defense of necessity. Furthermore, according to the Claimant, the LG&E tribunal
erred in reversing the onus of proof by placing the burden on the claimant to
demonstrate that the Respondent was not in a situation of necessity and also by
making an erroneous finding concerning when the crisis ended. The Claimant
finds somewhat puzzling the holding that the crisis ended in April 2003, when
President Kirchner was elected, puzzling since the President himself has
acknowledged that the crisis ended in the second quarter of 2002.

The Respondent further develops the argument on state of necessity in its
Rejoinder. The Respondent questions the reference to the payoff of IMF debt
since it occurred 28 months after the Claimant took the decision to sell its shares
in Transener. The Respondent explains that the state of necessity analysis
should be limited in time to the date when the Claimant took its decision to sell.
The Respondent observes that the Claimant has justified the sale of shares in
terms of its obligation to mitigate harm, but this charade may be maintained only
up to the date when the decision to sell the shares was taken, since it is obvious

that the value of the shares increased substantially later on.

95

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 98 of 133

234.

The Respondent emphasizes that the dimensions and depth of the collapse of its
economy were such that the UN General Assembly took the unusual step of
reducing the Respondent's required contribution to the UN budget. The
Respondent questions the comparison of growth rates presented by the Claimant
and points out that in none of the other countries there had been a decrease of
about 25% in GNP in the years 1999-2000.

Then the Respondent proceeds to rebut the Claimant's interpretation of Article 4
of the Treaty. The Respondent argues that a situation of emergency must be
distinguished from the other circumstances covered in this article. Indeed, if a
state of national emergency were synonymous with war or civil disobedience,
there would be no need to add to those terms. Because those terms were
added, the expression “state of national emergency” must be given meaning in
order to construe properly the Treaty. The Respondent adds that it had a
consistent practice of referring to situations of national emergency in its bilateral
investment treaties. As indicated above, the fact that there is an enumeration of
categories of emergencies in a certain order in Article 4 of the Treaty must mean
that the concepts enumerated are not identical, as maintained by the Claimant.
The Respondent then proceeds to the textual analysis of this provision based on
the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy and points out that the term
“emergency” implies a situation of danger or of disaster which, irrespective of its
cause, requires immediate action at the national level. Therefore, its meaning
cannot logically be limited to mean only physical insurrection. Following Article

31.1 of the Vienna Convention, the Respondent analyzes the context in which

96

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 99 of 133

national emergency is used and observes that the circumstances covered in
Article 4 of the Treaty are unusual or exceptional circumstances in general and
not only situations derived from a war or civil unrest; national emergency is a
wider concept and may come about because of economic, financial, social or
institutional questions.

236. The Respondent contends that the fact that the Treaty does not specifically
include measures undertaken to assure public order or the protection of essential
security interests does not mean that the exercise of such power by the State is
not permitted under the Treaty. It is well known that the police power of the State
exists independently of its inclusion in the Treaty. In ELS/ the ICJ stated that
“Every system of law must provide, for example, for interferences with the normal
exercise of rights during public emergencies and the like.” The Respondent
argues that it is not possible to infer that the parties to the Treaty were limiting
their capacity to handle emergencies and other similar powers. It is necessary to
seek a harmonization of the applicable norms and to find a balance between the
investors’ rights and the powers of the State as Articles 4 and 8(4) of the Treaty
do. This harmonization, for instance, would mean that, in the case concerning
the standard of fair and equitable treatment, what is fair and equitable in ordinary
times is not the same as what is fair and equitable in an emergency.

237. The Respondent disagrees with the statement of the Claimant that the absence
in the Treaty of a provision equivalent to Article XI of the US-Argentina BIT is a

reflection of the traditional position of the UK rejecting the state of necessity

® U.S. v. Italy (Electronica Sicula Spa [ELSI] case), 1989 ICJ Reports 15 (July 20, 1989) [hereinafter,
ELSI, pp. 74-75.

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 100 of 133

240.

defense. The Respondent maintains that the UK has actually invoked this
doctrine in several international conflicts and was in favor of including it in the
Draft Articles to rule out illegality of certain types of conduct.

The Respondent considers that the facts in AMT have no bearing on the situation
of the instant case and considers the conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in that
case to be inapplicable here. As for the relationship between Articles 2 and 4 of
the Treaty, the Respondent argues that the existence of Article 4 indicates that
the principles and obligations set forth in the rest of the Treaty relate only to
normal situations and not to circumstances where there is a crisis. Since in such
situations a State may restrict even certain basic human rights, it would appear
contrary to reason that a State could not restrict the application of certain norms
regarding foreign investment. To maintain otherwise, reasons the Respondent,
would mean to consider the law of foreign investment as jus cogens.

The Respondent also denies that it provided compensation to other investors as
alleged by the Claimant. The Respondent points out that not all remuneration
systems directly affected the general economic interests of Argentine society: for
example, an airport tax, which affects very few users, cannot be compared with
gas, electricity or water tariffs, which affect all the population. Where certain
dollar tariffs survived, they did so because there was economic capacity to pay
them and their level therefore constituted a just and reasonable tariff.

The Respondent then turns to state of necessity under international law and
questions, on two separate grounds, the constant objection by the United

Kingdom argued by the Claimant. First, the Respondent notes that the Claimant

98

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 101 of 133

241.

242.

243.

is a private party and that only a sovereign could raise such objection, and
second, there is scarce practice where the doctrine of the constant objection has
been recognized. As for the statement of the Claimant that there are no modern
instances in which respondent parties have argued the defense of necessity
successfully, the Respondent points out that there have been no cases
comparable to the emergency in the Argentine Republic.

The Respondent also contests the relevance of the case of the Russian
Indemnity. The Russian claim is not comparable in terms of the magnitude of the
external debt of the Argentine Republic or the Argentine crisis in general. The
tribunal in that case rejected the necessity defense because the total sum owed
by Turkey did not affect or put in danger the Turkish State, while the claims
against the Argentine Republic would destroy the budget equilibrium, undermine
its economic and financial system and affect its recuperation from the crisis.

The Respondent observes that the Claimant minimizes the decisions that
recognized the necessity defense by pointing out that in those cases the
pertinent causes were not in any way attributable to the State. The Respondent
in turn draws the attention of this Tribunal to the fact that in such case law it is
generally accepted that businessmen need to consider the possible causes of
unrest and take them into account beforehand when making their decisions to
enter a particular country.

The Respondent also comments on two cases adduced by the Claimant and not
mentioned by the Respondent in its Statement of Defense because they were not

considered relevant: the cases of the Serbian Loans and the case of the

99

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 102 of 133

244,

245.

Companhia General del Orinoco. The situation of the Serbian Loans again is not
comparable to that of this case. It is true that the PClJ decided that if payment
could not be made in gold francs then payment could be made for an equivalent
amount of francs, but in this case the Argentine Republic could not satisfy the
claims without impairing the economic, financial and social stability of the State.
It is also true that the PClJ held, as recognized by the Claimant, that economic
disruptions caused by the war could give rise to equitable considerations which
would be considered in a later phase of the case.

As to the Orinoco case, Venezuela could compensate the claimant for the
damages without endangering an essential interest of the State, which is not the
case here. The facts are also totally different, since Venezuela had given to the
claimant a license to operate with complete freedom in a part of its territory
disputed by Colombia and subject to arbitration. Venezuela did not allege
necessity but rescinded the contract first and then annulled it.

The Respondent refers approvingly to the determination of the severity of the
Argentine crisis by the LG&E tribunal. As regards the “essential interest”
requirement in Article 25(1)(a) of the Draft Articles, the Respondent observes that
in the Commentary on the Draft Articles, the issue of whether an interest is
essential depends on the overall circumstances of the case and cannot be pre-
judged. Furthermore, in the words of Professor Ago, who was at one point
special rapporteur of the ILC on State responsibility, an “essential interest”
should be exceptional but not be limited to those instances that endanger the

continuity of the State. The Respondent also finds support in the case of

100

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 103 of 133

246.

247.

Gabcikovo-Nagymaros where the ICJ stated that protection by the State of its
environment qualifies as an essential interest under Article 25 of the Draft
Articles even where it is limited to a specific region and not all the territory of the
State. In the instant case, the actions of the Respondent had as an objective the
protection of social stability and the maintenance of essential services vital to the
health and welfare of the population, an objective which is recognized in the
framework of the international law of human rights.

As to the requirement that there be a serious and imminent danger, the
Respondent points out that, at the time the Measures were adopted, the
Respondent had previously adopted many measures without achieving the
desired results. It also cannot be ignored that the Respondent had been drifting
for many months and that, at one point, it had five presidents in five days.

The Respondent rebuts the understanding of the Claimant of the requirement
that the measures taken must be the only way to address the situation. The
Respondent considers that this term cannot be interpreted in extremis and that
such provisions do not permit international tribunals to substitute their judgment
for that of the State, acting in a crisis, which had been forced to confront and
choose among contradictory priorities. Seeking support from the jurisprudence
of the European Court of Human Rights, the Respondent contends that States
must be accorded a margin of appreciation in the manner that they handle their
affairs, which has been recognized by the European Court of Human Rights.

The Respondent also adduces that the Argentine Supreme Court has validated

101

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 104 of 133

248.

249.

250.

the Measures in view of a crisis of a gravity never before experienced (cases
Massa, Bustos and Rinaldi).

The Respondent contends that the requirement that a State did not contribute to
the crisis must be applied only in those situations in which the contribution of the
State was substantial, not merely incidental or peripheral as recognized in LG&E.
The Respondent differs from the holding by the LG&E tribunal regarding the
continuation of the crisis. The Respondent maintains that the crisis produced
serious and continuing effects, the standard of living has been reduced
drastically, inflation is rising again, and the rate of exchange of the peso with the
dollar must be maintained low to keep the country competitive.

It is not realistic, argues the Respondent, to return to the economic arrangements
that existed before the crisis when the situation in the country bears no
relationship to the situation when the Concession Contract was signed.
Furthermore, the Respondent argues that, if the exemption from responsibility is
limited to the period of emergency during which the Measures are taken, the
raison d’etre of the doctrine of necessity disappears. The nature of the
exceptional circumstances means that their repercussions will be long lasting,
continuing well beyond the immediate crisis and still in place when National Grid

decided to sell its shares.

. CONSIDERATIONS OF THE TRIBUNAL

The Tribunal will address first the issue of the meaning of Article 4 of the Treaty
and whether the term “national emergency” therein may be expanded to include

an emergency beyond situations derived from war or civil unrest.

102

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 105 of 133

251.

252.

254.

It will be useful to reproduce here in full the text of Article 4 of the Treaty which
under the heading of “Compensation for Losses” reads as follows:

“Investors of one Contracting Party whose investments in the

territory of the other Contracting Party suffer losses owing to

war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national

emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot or resulting from

arbitrary action by the authorities in the territory of the latter

Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Contracting

Party treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification,

compensation or other settlement, no less favorable than

that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own

investors or to investors of any third State. Resulting

payments shall be freely transferable.”
The Tribunal observes first that this article is concerned with compensation for
losses in situations of national emergency and others referred to in the text.
Second, it is also concerned with losses arising from arbitrary treatment. Third,
the parties provide for at least national treatment of each other’s investors or, if
better, the treatment accorded to investors of a third State. Fourth, the parties
envisage that any compensation will be freely transferable.
It is evident from the foregoing that the purpose of Article 4 is not to exclude
compensation for losses arising from, among other situations, national
emergency but rather the contrary. The commitment of the parties is to ensure
that their respective investors do not lose out in such situations. In this respect,
the Tribunal finds it significant that the losses due to war, armed conflict, etc. are
lumped together with those arising from arbitrary treatment which would be in
breach of Article 2(2) and give rise to a right to compensation.

Next, the Tribunal must address the significance of the absence in the Treaty of

an equivalent provision to Article X| of the US-Argentina BIT. The issue for the

103

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 106 of 133

256.

Tribunal is whether, as argued by the Respondent, the fact that the Argentine
Republic entered into the Treaty detracts from its capacity to handle emergencies
and other similar powers.
The Tribunal considers that, by concluding the Treaty with the United Kingdom,
the Respondent did not limit its powers that as a sovereign it would have under
international law except to the extent provided in the Treaty. What these powers
are in the context of the state of necessity defense argued by the Respondent
are best analyzed by turning to the conditions under which such defense is
recognized under Article 25 of the Draft Articles, which both Parties agree reflect
the current status of customary international law. Article 25 of the Draft Articles
provides as follows:
“1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for
precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with
an international obligation of the State unless the act:
(a) is the only means for the State to safeguard an
essential interest against a grave and imminent peril;
and
(b) does not seriously imperil an essential interest of
the State or States towards which the obligation
exists, or of the international community as a whole.

2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a
ground for precluding wrongfulness if:

(a) the international obligation in question excludes
the possibility of invoking necessity; or

(b) the State has contributed to the situation of
necessity.”

Before considering whether the Respondent has proven that it meets these

conditions, the Tribunal will address the Claimant’s contention that the necessity

104

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 107 of 133

257.

defense may not be raised against the Claimant because the United Kingdom
has consistently refused to accept it. The United Kingdom may have a tradition
of opposing the state of necessity defense and it is possible that, as argued by
the Claimant, an article such as Article XI of the US-Argentina BIT may be
missing because of the practice of the United Kingdom in this respect. However,
there is evidence that such practice has known exceptions and Professor
Crawford refers to the case of the 1832 Anglo-Portuguese dispute in which
Portugal appropriated the property of British subjects based on the necessity
argument. At the time, the British government was advised that the necessity
justification “must depend upon the circumstances of the particular case, but it
must be imminent and urgent.” The Respondent has adduced other instances
such as the Caroline and the Torre Canyon incident. This notwithstanding, the
Tribunal is not convinced even if the practice was not subject to known
exceptions, that this would prevent the other Contracting Party from raising the
necessity defense. It is accepted that the Draft Articles represent current
customary international law and, therefore, the necessity defense is admissible
under the conditions listed in Article 25 of the Draft Articles. Since the
Contracting Parties did not agree to exclude it under the Treaty, either of them is
entitled to raise it.

The Tribunal will now proceed to examine whether the conditions of Article 25 of
the Draft Articles have been met by the Respondent bearing in mind that, while

the state of necessity has been accepted by tribunals as an admissible defense

in theory, it has rarely been found to exist in practice because of its exceptional
nature. In the words of the Commentary to the Draft Articles, “necessity will only
rarely be available to excuse non-performance of an obligation and ... it is

subject to strict limitations to safeguard against possible abuse.”*”

258. The Tribunal will consider first the threshold question of whether the Respondent

87

88

89

contributed to the situation of necessity which it now raises in its defense. In the
Commentary to the Draft Articles, it is stated that such contribution “must be
sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral.” The Claimant
has pointed out that the ICJ rejected Hungary’s necessity defense in the
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project case because it had “helped” to bring about the
situation in question, and has interpreted “helped” to mean that mere help in the
development of the crisis would make the necessity defense inadmissible. On

the other hand, the Respondent has argued that:

“If this non-contribution requirement was interpreted in a way
that any contribution from the state, even those unintentional
or indirect, gave rise to the requirement unfulfilment [sic], in
practice, it would imply the impossibility of states to resort to
the state of necessity as a circumstance excluding
wrongfulness. With respect to the state of necessity due to
economic reasons, a reasonable interpretation of the
requirement is specially important. In which general
economic crisis of a state is it possible to state that there
was no contribution from authorities, even through the lack
of foreseeability [sic] and by failing to adopt all the necessary
measures to reduce the effects of the crisis?”

259. The Respondent's expert has outlined six external elements which contributed to
the crisis: the slowdown of capital flows to emerging markets after the Asian and
Russian crises, the ensuing economic weakness of commercial partners of the
Argentine Republic, in particular Brazil, the devaluation of the Brazilian currency
early in 1999, the strengthening of the dollar between 1998 and 2001, and the
restrictive monetary policy of the US from mid 1999 to mid 2000.*° However, the
same expert also refers to internal factors such as the fiscal deficit,
indebtedness, which may have been caused only in part by external factors, and
structural vulnerability, including a relatively closed economy because of a long
history of internally oriented commercial policies, rigidity of the labor market, and
the high coefficient of external debt to exports, which showed the problematic
sustainability of the external debt.”

260. The evidence before the Tribunal shows that the crisis was caused by internal
and external factors and that these factors were substantive and direct. As noted
in the evaluation of the crisis by the IMF,* both types of factors played a role and
their importance varied over time but they all had a significant part in contributing
to its seriousness. Internal factors such as external indebtedness, fiscal policies
or labor market rigidity were under the control of the Respondent and created a
fertile ground for the crisis to develop when in the late nineties the external
factors adduced by the Respondent came to play. The Respondent's response

to the crisis further contributed to it. In the words of the IMF study, the crisis was

“exacerbated by a series of policy mistakes...notably the capital controls, the
corralito and corralén, and the asymmetrical pesoization and indexation.”
Mindful of the categorical terms of paragraph 2(b) of Article 25 of the Draft
Articles, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has failed to show that it did
not contribute to the situation of necessity on which it based its defense.

This conclusion is shared by the tribunals in CMS™ and Enron.” On the other
hand, the LG&E tribunal determined otherwise. In this respect, the Tribunal
observes that in that case, the tribunal had previously reached the conclusion
that a situation existed under Article XI of the US-Argentina BIT which provides
that said treaty does not preclude “the application by either Party of measures
necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfillment of its obligations
with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security,
or the protection of its own essential security interests.” After determining that
the protections under Article XI applied in the LG & E case, the tribunal notes that
“satisfaction of the state of necessity standard as it exists in international law
(reflected in Article 25 of the ILC’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility) supports
the Tribunal’s conclusion.” Then as it proceeds to analyze the requirements
under this article and, as regards the State’s contribution to the crisis, the LG&E
Tribunal considered that the “Claimants have not proved that the Respondent

has contributed to cause the severe crisis faced by the country.”*”” Thus, that

tribunal placed on the claimants the burden of proof of an allegation made by the
Respondent. The lack of an article in the Treaty equivalent to Article XI and the
fact that the Tribunal considers it to be the burden of the Respondent to sustain

its allegations may explain the different conclusion reached by the Tribunal.

262. Having found that the Respondent's own evidence shows that its contribution to

the crisis was substantial, the Tribunal does not need to address whether the
state of necessity alleged by the Respondent meets the other conditions set forth
in Article 25 of the Draft Articles for its admissibility since these are listed as
cumulative conditions: failure to meet any of them is sufficient ground to reject

the necessity defense.

Vill. COMPENSATION

Respondent's breaches of the Treaty should be the loss of fair market value

Respondent resulted in serious losses which must be compensated. Claimant
takes the position that the most appropriate way of determining these losses is to
adopt a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach as applied to the Claimant's
investment in the principal business of Transener. Accordingly, Claimant
proposes, first, to calculate the value of this investment as of 1 January 2002
without the Measures, then subtracting the value of the said investment as of the
same date. Claimant's approach acknowledges and assumes that both the
devaluation of January 2002 and the associated economic down-turn did in fact
occur, but seeks to isolate from these events the impact of the Measures.
Claimant calculates the resulting loss in FMV at $59,069,583.

Claimant maintains that the Award should also provide compensation for the
opportunity cost of equity lost by the Claimant from January 1, 2002 to the date
of sale of its ownership interest in Transener, August 18, 2004, on the ground
that the Claimant was improperly deprived of the benefits of its investment during
that period. Claimant's position is that it should therefore be compensated for the
opportunity cost of that capital at the rate of 12.94% per annum which was
Transener’s approved return on equity as determined by Argentine regulatory
authorities. The addition of this item of compensation would yield $22,321,139
for a subtotal of $81,390,722.

Finally, in order to compensate Claimant for the lack of use of the money owed to
Claimant from August 18, 2004 to the date of payment by the Respondent, the
above amount should be augmented by a factor representing the time value of

money. According to Claimant, the appropriate rate should reflect the historical

110

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 113 of 133

return on equity which the Claimant has demonstrated that it could have earned if
it had invested the above amount in its own business. Claimant seeks to
demonstrate that the Claimant's rate of return on equity (as confirmed by U.K.
regulators) is 10.9% per annum. This calculation would add to the subtotal of
$81,390,722 (as of August 18, 2004) the sum of $31,009,278 for a total (updated
to October 1, 2007) of $112,400,000.'"

The Respondent's analysis is markedly different. In addition to denying that the
Respondent has violated Claimant's legal rights, the Respondent urges that if the
Tribunal should nevertheless find otherwise, it should determine that the
Claimant had agreed with Transener on a different standard of compensation as
set forth in the agreements with Transener, establishing the transmission and
distribution concession. Any compensation should therefore be limited to the
proceeds of sale of the Claimant's shares."* The Respondent further maintains
that Claimant negligently overpaid in purchasing its interest in Transener,
incurring indebtedness in an unnecessary and profligate manner. The
Respondent maintains that Claimant proceeded at its own risk when it decided to
invest in Transba and the Fourth Line (assuming whatever losses might be
implicated in those risks), and finally, disposing of its interest in Transener in an
unnecessarily hurried fashion, thereby incurring further self-inflicted financial

injury.

Respondent did not present its own model or methodology attempting to evaluate
the financial impact of the Measures, submitting instead an expert report
purporting to show at least four serious conceptual errors and four
methodological errors in the analysis presented by Claimant’s expert.
Respondent concludes that no compensation is payable to Claimant.

Finally, Respondent urges that if, contrary to their analysis and conclusions, the
Tribunal should nevertheless find that any compensation is payable to Claimant
in some amount, that any interest assessed should be simple interest at a normal
commercial rate as provided for in Article 5 of the Treaty, such as LIBOR (the

London Inter Bank Offering Rate) or the rate applicable to U.S. Treasury bills.

. CONSIDERATION OF THE TRIBUNAL

Article 5 of the Treaty provides guidance regarding compensation for
expropriation which the Tribunal does not find to be present here. The Treaty
does not, however, provide much guidance regarding compensation standards
for other kinds of violations. Thus, the Tribunal needs to revert to the principles
of compensation under customary international law as reflected in the Draft
Articles reflect customary international law. Article 31(1) of the Draft Articles
provides:

“The responsible state is under an obligation to make full reparation for the
injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.”

270.

271.

The Commission’s commentary (at (2)) on this article refers to the following
statement of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Factory at
Chorzow case:

“The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act...is

that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of

the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability,
have existed if that act had not been committed.”'”

The Tribunal has been greatly assisted by the Parties in its study of the
compensation issues involved in this case. Claimant presented as its principal
expert on valuation and compensation Mr. John Wood-Collins. Mr. Wood-Collins
submitted an extensive report setting forth his calculations and reasoning in
support of the request of Claimant. Respondent presented several expert
witnesses on the issues of valuation and compensation, including, inter alia, the
declarations of Professors Molina, Bello, Gallino and Sruoga. The Tribunal has
studied all of these experts’ declarations carefully and has engaged its own
expert, Professor A. Louis Calvet, whose Draft Report benefited from the
comments of the Parties and the Parties’ own experts. It has also had the benefit
of observing each of the experts being cross-examined extensively by opposing
counsel and has had the opportunity to ask questions of them directly. The
Tribunal is grateful to all of the experts for their contribution to our understanding

of this matter.

274.

The Tribunal has reviewed carefully the experts’ reports and will refer to them to
the extent that the Tribunal considers them relevant to its considerations.

The Tribunal will deal first with the Respondent's argument that the sale of the
Claimant's interest in Transener to Dolphin was not a reasonable business
decision intended to mitigate damages, but rather a negligent and even
purposeful attempt to inflict a serious economic burden on the Respondent.
Suffice it to say that the Tribunal finds no evidence that the Claimant sold its
interest in Transener for a price other than the best price it could obtain in the
circumstances. Regarding the allegations that it incurred a self-inflicted wound in
lieu of accepting the pre-conditions to renegotiation established by UNIREN, the
Tribunal does not intend to interpose its business judgment for that of the owners
at the time. The Tribunal further takes note that the Claimant made an express
declaration to the effect that the sale of its shares was being made without
prejudice to the results of its arbitration claim before this Tribunal. Furthermore,
the Respondent made it known at the time of the sale that it would hold buyers of
shares, such as Dolphin, responsible for any compensation awarded to claimants
such as National Grid. There seems to be little doubt that announcements of this
sort would have weighed on the price paid by Dolphin, or any other buyer,
pressures which would not seem to have been present in other comparable
transactions.

The Tribunal turns now to the task of assessing the quantum of compensation for
breach of Respondent’s obligations under the Treaty to provide “fair and

equitable treatment” as well as “protection and constant security”. According to

114

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 117 of 133

the compensatory principles set forth above, the compensation should reflect the
loss of value of the Claimant’s shares in Transener as a result of the Measures
and other actions taken by the government of the Argentine Republic. As

indicated above,'*

the Tribunal recognizes that the Measures were taken at a
time of economic crisis and that it is part of the task of the Tribunal, in calculating
the quantum of compensation, to assess the effect of such crisis, irrespective of
the Measures, on the application of the Regulatory Framework. The Claimant
has attempted to deal with these complicated factual circumstances through the
presentation of the so-called “Without Measures” scenario.

275. The first task of the Tribunal in determining the quantum of compensation is to

select among the many valuation methodologies available including “book value,”

“asset value or replacement cost,” “comparable transaction value,” “option
valuation,” “discounted cash flow,” and variations on all of the above.
Respondent has argued in favor of valuing Claimant's interest in Transener
through the use of “comparable transaction value,” making use of data from
transactions concluded on the Buenos Aires stock exchange’. Without
attempting to engage in an exhaustive evaluation of each of these various
approaches, the Tribunal finds that there is a broad consensus that where, as

here, the problem presented is not to fix the value of a fixed asset, but instead to

104 See, e.g. para. 180, supra.

‘5 This latter approach has been criticized by Claimant's expert on several grounds, including the
“thinness” of the market, the limited number of transactions and number of shares traded, and finally,
the inclusion of data on sales of shares which occurred years after the Dolphin sale (when the “new”
Transener was operating in an entirely new tariff environment and had been shorn of approximately
one-third of its debt).

115

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 118 of 133

determine the loss, if any, of fair market value of an operating business entity,‘

there is considerable merit in using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method.
Indeed, this approach has been endorsed in principle by the Respondent's own
expert'”’ and was applied by ENRE to determine the RAB of Transener in the
first five-year tariff review.

276. The DCF method, while not without its drawbacks, has the advantage of
realistically assessing the economic value of a going concern by relying on the
stream of value that it can generate over its operative life. In order to function
properly, the DCF approach requires that the concern in question must have a
history of profitable operation.’ This does not appear to be a major issue in this

case, since Transener has a history of almost nine years of successful

109

operation. A second potential drawback is that the DCF methodology

necessarily involves projecting future cash flows—calling for considerable

Sefior Bello: No, lo acabo de aclarar recién cuando contesté recién que sigo sosteniendo que el

Obviously, the Transba and Fourth Line investments are more recent, but the principles of valuation
are the same and the track record of Transener is helpful.

latitude for creativity and speculation as evidenced by the conflicting views of the

experts engaged by the Parties and the Tribunal.

277. \n the present case, however, this potential drawback is also less worrisome for

several reasons. First, as indicated earlier,""° the Respondent's international
solicitation for investments in the power sector in 1992 relied heavily on the
Regulatory Framework which functioned smoothly until it was dismantled by the
Measures. Indeed, the performance of Transener was reviewed in detail by
ENRE in the ordinary (pre-crisis) 1998 five-year tariff review, which essentially
ratified the rate structure and other regulatory parameters. ENRE’s review
recognized that Transener’s operations were profitable and, also, that it had
resulted in reduced outages and operating costs. Similar operating conditions
and results continued through the end of its accounting period in December
2001." In addition, in contrast to the examination of hypothetical market
prospects for an investment in, for example, steel or automotive production, the
situation of Transener is less subject to speculative projections for two reasons:
first, the essential ground rules for establishing fair and reasonable tariffs had

112

already been agreed to,''* and second, because the power from Transener was

Exhibit CRA-8 to the Report of John Wood-Collins.

The legal standards applicable to the ENRE process are established in Articles 40 and 41 of the

Electricity Law (Law 24,065) which provide as follows:

 

“ARTICULO 40 — Los servicios ini os por los transportistas y distribuidores seran idos a
tarifas justas y razonables, las que se ajustaran a los siguientes principios:

(a) Proveeran a los transportistas y distribuidores que operen en forma econdmica y
prudente, la oportunidad de obtener ingresos suficientes para satisfacer los costos
operativos razonables_ aplicables al servicio impuestos, amortizaciones y una tasa de
retorno determinada conforme lo dispuesto en el articulo 41 de esta ley...”

117

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 120 of 133

sold not in the private commercial market, but rather to Cammesa, an agency of
the Argentine government.

278. As is normal in utility regulation, ENRE determined the RAB for Transener and
then relied on that RAB to establish tariffs at a level which, as called for in the
Electricity Law, would allow the utility to recover its operating costs, amortization,
taxes, and a reasonable rate of return. If this process is viewed “in reverse,” the
DCF value of the “free cash” element of those future cash flows, properly
discounted, will necessarily equal to the RAB. As determined by ENRE, the RAB
in 1998 at the time of the first five-year tariff review was $310.9 million.

279. For Transener, it is therefore, appropriate, as Claimant contends, to begin with
the RAB and then adjust it to what it would have been in January 2002. For this

purpose, Claimant’s expert calculated the free cash flows forward and discounted

 

“Article 40 — The services provided by transmission and distribution companies shall be offered at fair
and reasonable tariffs, which shall be in accordance with the following principles:

(a) They shall provide transmission and distribution companies operating economically and
prudently with the opportunity to obtain sufficient revenues to meet reasonable operating
costs applicable to the services, taxes, amortizations and a certain rate of return
determined in accordance with the provisions of section 41 hereunder...”

“ARTICULO 41 — Las tarifas que apliquen los transportistas y distribuidores deberan posibilitar una
razonable tasa de rentabilidad, a aquellas empresas que operen con eficiencia. Asimismo, la tasa
debera:

(a) Guardar relacion con el grado de eficiencia y eficacia operativa de la empresa;

(b) Ser similar, como promedio de la industria, a la de otras actividades de riesgo similar o
comparable nacional e internacionalmente.”

Article 41 — Tariffs applied by transmission and distribution companies shall include a reasonable
profitability rate for those companies operating efficiently. In addition, such rate shall:

(a) Be linked to the company’s degree of operating efficiency and effectiveness;

(b) Be similar, as industry average, to the rates of other activities posing similar or
comparable risks both at the national and international level.

them back to the valuation date. On this basis, the Claimant’s expert, using
January 1, 2002 as the valuation date, determined the free cash flows and
terminal value of the concession at $320.8 million. This seems a reasonable
figure, bearing in mind the investments made by the Claimant during the
intervening period since the 1998 review. However, this value is of limited use to
the Tribunal, as will become apparent in the considerations below.

For Transener’s 90% interest in Transba, the available data is more limited (and
no RAB was ever calculated by ENRE), but using the same approach and
reasonable assumptions regarding future tariffs and costs, the resulting cash
flows and terminal value are calculated by Claimant's expert at US $112.8
million.

Regarding the Fourth Line, data available for use in the DCF process is found not
in operating results (because of the date of the award of the contract (November
1997) and time required to complete construction), but are found instead in the
revenues agreed to be paid over the first 15 years of the Fourth Line contract
(Fourth Line Canon) and, after that period, on the basis of the agreed tariff
regime through 2088. These revenues, subject to certain appropriate
adjustments, result in a DCF value for the Fourth Line investment of US $218.2
million as of January 1, 2002.

Crucial to these calculations, of course, is the development and use of an
appropriate discount rate. This process is complex and is the subject of a great
deal of theoretical debate in the professions of economics and finance as

reflected in the experts’ reports and comments on the record in these

119

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 122 of 133

proceedings. The situation is complicated further, in this case, by the Argentine
economic crisis of 2001-2002. Clearly, neither party could have anticipated the
precise features of such a crisis, but no serious effort at valuation/compensation
can ignore its potential impact on the business of Transener. Claimant
recognizes this and makes a serious attempt to deal with this situation. Claimant
points to the Regulated Asset Base and to the terms of the Electricity Law which
required the determination of a reasonable rate of return. Claimant’s expert then
creates a hypothetical five-year period of gradual upward adjustment for
electricity rates which, had it been adopted, could have allowed some relief for
purchasers of electricity in the immediate aftermath of the crisis but still
preserved the “economic equilibrium” of the concession.

The Respondent objects to these assumptions because (1) they involve an
admittedly hypothetical construct, and (2) the governmental authority was free to
establish such policies and priorities as it deemed necessary in the national
interest, especially at a time of national crisis. Although it is, of course, correct
that the Respondent, as a sovereign government, had the authority to take the
measures it saw fit under the circumstances, it does not follow that, in taking
such decisions, the Respondent was liberated from the legal consequences
resulting from those measures. Since we have determined that the course of
action adopted by the government did not comport with its treaty obligations, we
are required to establish an appropriate legal remedy to compensate the

Claimant.

120

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 123 of 133

284.

While the “without Measures” scenario proposed by the Claimant is based, to a
large extent, on the principles included in the Regulatory Framework, it is
nonetheless a theoretical scenario which has been criticized by the Respondent
deems unrealistic given the Argentine crisis. Equally theoretical, however, is the
scenario used by the Respondent's experts to show the bad timing of the sale to
Dolphin and their attempts to establish that all would have been well for Claimant
had it simply retained its investment until the worst aspects of the crisis had
abated. Following Respondent's line of reasoning, the value of the Claimant's
indirect shareholding in Transener would not have diminished had it waited to sell
its shares until several years after January 2002 (for example, when Petrobras
Energia agreed to the offer of Eton Park).

As suggested by Prof. Calvet’s Draft Report,'"* the Tribunal believes that in these
complex and difficult circumstances it is wise, apart from Claimant’s DCF
analysis, to have access to other data or approaches which may be helpful.
Mainly because of the uncertainties involved in the “without Measures” scenario,
the Tribunal, while not discarding the analysis and conclusions of Claimant’s
DCF approach, will also have recourse to the comparable transactions method of
valuation.

Claimant's expert has pointed out the inherent difficulties involved in finding
comparable transactions given that electricity transmission is a natural monopoly,
which means that, by definition, there are no other firms competing in the same

market. He examines two sales of Transener shares, namely, the sale to

"3 See e.g., para. 2.4.

121

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 124 of 133

287.

Dolphin of Taico’s 4.88% stake in Transener and the Petrobras Energia agreed
sale of its 26.32% stake in Transener to Eton Park in June 2006. Claimant's
expert finds this latter transaction of limited value because of the very different
conditions existing at that time from those prevailing, inter alia, at the time of the
sale of shares by the Claimant. The Tribunal agrees that this transaction is of
limited value for the purpose of assessing the reasonableness of the price paid
by Dolphin for the Claimant’s shares. However, the Tribunal considers that the
Petrobras transaction may be a useful reference price from a different
perspective.

Indeed, the Tribunal finds that the price agreed by Petrobras Energia presents a
useful proxy to assess the value of National Grid’s shares at the time had certain
adjustments been made to the debt of Transener and to the Regulatory
Framework with the purpose of (1) recognizing the impact of the crisis on
Transener and (2) attempting to carry out the intent and spirit of the Regulatory
Framework. The Tribunal considers that the rise in the price of Transener’s
shares, which the Respondent has repeatedly pointed to as evidence of the poor
timing of the Claimant's sale to Dolphin, actually provides valuable real-world
data reflecting the effect of more normal market conditions and reduced
uncertainty on the share price. By June of 2006, a tariff increase had been
secured and Transener had been relieved of a large portion of its debt. While the
Tribunal is mindful that these measures had nothing directly to do with the
agreed Regulatory Framework, these important changes to Transener’s financial

situation demonstrate the kinds of measures which a country in crisis might have

122

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 125 of 133

adopted at an early stage of the crisis in order to reduce the uncertainty faced by
Transener. Those measures resemble, at least in spirit, the kinds of adjustments
which the Claimant's expert has tried to construct in seeking to establish a fair
value for the Claimant's interest.

288. Thus, the Tribunal will consider the price offered by Eton Park for the shares of
Petrobras Energia as a point of reference for the value of the Claimant's
investment, relying on this value as a surrogate for the value shares of the
company on June 25, 2002. The amount offered for the shares of Petrobras
Energia was $54 million for a 26.32% stake in Transener. Based on this price,
the stake of the Claimant in Transener would have been worth $52.8 million.’

The Tribunal adopts this figure as the market value as of June 25, 2002, in lieu of

the Claimant's “Without Measures” valuation.''®

289. As indicated earlier, the Tribunal, in reaching these conclusions, has carefully
studied the reports and declarations of each of the experts as well as the
presentations of legal counsel. In lieu of relying directly or solely on the opinion
or valuation of any of the experts, we have made use of their opinions and
compared them to available market information. In so doing, the Tribunal has
attempted to carefully evaluate the reasonableness of its conclusions. For
example, in using this valuation derived from the Eton Park/Petrobras

"4 Report of F. Bello and F. Molina, para. 228.

"® The Tribunal is aware that, by using this figure as the market value to reduce the “Without Measures”
values arrived at by Claimant’s expert based on DCF, we are mixing valuation approaches. The
Tribunal takes this approach having carefully considered and made use of all of the experts’ reports
and declarations, documentation and circumstances surrounding this dispute. We have concluded
that this approach most closely conforms to the economic and financial realities. We have attempted
to achieve this objective by using the Petrobras transaction as a “reality check” on a very complex
economic situation which defies the usual theoretical prescriptions.

123

transaction, the Tribunal has not explicitly excluded the value of the non-
regulated (or “other businesses”) of Transener. The Tribunal considers, first, that
it is, in one sense, valid and sufficient to say that it is not possible, in examining a
market transaction, to identify what portion of the price was paid by the buyer for
the regulated vs. non-regulated portion of Transener’s activities. However, to
eliminate any doubt, the Tribunal would make the following additional
observations. First, the valuation of Claimant’s expert, in developing his “free
cash” projections, had already eliminated the non-regulated portions of
Transener’s business. Therefore, by reducing Claimant's “Without Measures”
valuation by approximately 23%, the Tribunal has already implicitly taken account
of the “other business” issue. Or, if one prefers to look at this issue from a
different standpoint, the Tribunal notes that Prof. Calvet, in both his Draft and
Final Reports, had criticized the discount rate used by Claimant's expert, Mr.

"S Where Mr. Wood-Collins’ analysis had arrived

Wood-Collins, as being too low.
at a proposed discount rate of 10.84%, Prof. Calvet suggested that a more
appropriate discount rate would be in a range between 11.76% on the low side to
14.18% on the high side.'’’ Again, we note that the Wood-Collins analysis
(before applying the discount rate) had already excluded the contributions from
the “other businesses.” By adopting the valuation calculated from the per share

value of the Etonpark/Petrobras sale, (and comparing the resulting figure to the
“Before Measures” valuation reached by Claimant's expert) the Tribunal has, in
"16 Argentina’s experts, Bello and Molina, made similar criticisms.

"? The experts were in agreement that the effect of a higher discount rate would be to substantially
reduce the “Without Measures” value of Transener’s business.

124

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 127 of 133

effect, adopted a discount rate of approximately 12% - a rate significantly higher
than that used by Claimant’s expert, and within the range of rates suggested by

Prof. Calvet.

290. Following this approach, the Tribunal concludes that the amount of compensation

291.

118

due would be $52.8 million minus the proceeds of sale of the shares to Dolphin
(US $14 million)", so that the net value of the Claimant's interest in Transener,
as of June 25, 2002, is valued at $38.8 million. The Tribunal recognizes that in
the complex circumstances of the the Claimant investment in Transener, many
possible approaches could possibly be used to achieve a reasonably just result.
Though none of the proposed approaches is perfect, the Tribunal finds that the
approach adopted here appropriately reflects the impact of the Measures, while
still recognizing that, because of the economic and social crisis, the situation of

the Argentine economy was definitely not “business as usual.”

C. ACTUALIZATION OF THE Loss

The next issue to be resolved is the method for actualizing damages, i.e., adding
an appropriate percentage per annum reflecting the time value of money, from
June 25, 2002 to the date of the Award. As already noted, the Claimant has
argued that damages should be increased by the expected return on equity for
Transener, proposing a rate of 12.9% for the period between January 1, 2002
and August 18, 2004. This rate, according to Claimant’s presentation, represents
the return on equity which Transener could reasonably have expected to earn

This latter sum was received by National Grid in August of 2004, so it has had use of these funds
since. Consistent with our approach to using the per share value from the Petrobras transaction
rather than more theoretical calculations, we deduct this amount in full from the amount of the
valuation determined above.

293.

during that period in the absence of the Measures. From August 18, 2004
forward to the date of the Award, Claimant suggests a rate of 10.9% which,
according to Claimant, represents the historical long-term return on equity
achieved by the Claimant.

The Respondent has objected to such rates as well as the appropriateness of
utilizing a return on equity for purposes of actualizing damages. The Respondent
has further pointed out that Article 5 of the Treaty contemplates the payment of
interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment, which the
Respondent interprets to mean the rate applicable to U.S. Treasury six-month
Certificates of Deposit or LIBOR.

The Tribunal is not satisfied with either of these approaches. Given the impact of
the crisis on the Argentine economy, we do not consider reasonable to apply
either the 12.9% or 10.9% rates suggested by Claimant for actualizing damages.
The reason for this is that we do not believe that these rates reflect, in a realistic
way, the options available to Claimant had it received this lump sum payment on
June 25, 2002. Even companies as large and successful as Claimant cannot
immediately absorb and invest such sums and achieve their standard rates of
return. Instead, budgeting and planning for the company for that year would
already have been completed. Company executives would have had to begin
identifying where to invest these funds, to procure machinery and equipment (or
build facilities or invest in personnel). As a result, profits on the investment of
such sums would only have appeared with a considerable lag. Similarly, the

Tribunal finds that the no-risk rate suggested by Respondent is inadequate to

126

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 129 of 133

fulfill the Chorzéw standard, which calls for full compensation to Claimant for the

consequences of the breach, including the compensation for the failure to receive

what it was due for an extended period of time.'*

294. The Tribunal believes, therefore, that it is appropriate and realistic to assume
that Claimant would have applied the sums received either to eliminate existing
debt or avoid incurring additional debt. We believe, therefore, that the
appropriate interest rate to be applied from June 25, 2002 forward to the date of
the Award should be an average interest rate which Claimant would have paid to
borrow from that date to the present. In the absence of clear evidence of
Claimant's borrowing rate in the record, the Tribunal will utilize a widely
recognized conservative measure, which has been adopted in the awards of
previous international arbitration tribunals, namely LIBOR plus 2%. The average
six-month dollar LIBOR rate from 2002 to the present date has been 3.15%.'”
Adding 2% to that base rate, the operative rate for actualizing damages to the

date of the Award shall be 5.15% compounded semi-annually.'*' On this basis,

"8 Supra at paras. 269-270. Also, as noted earlier, the guidelines provided by Article 5 of the Treaty
relate to compensation for expropriation (which we have found not to be present here). In addition,
the term “reasonable commercial rate of interest” has not been authoritatively defined or limited to the
rates which Respondent suggests. In the absence of an authoritative definition, the Tribunal finds
that the term “reasonable commercial rates” implies the need to consider both existing commercial
practice and the factual context of each case.

While the longstanding discussion in international arbitrations regarding simple vs. compound interest
has been continued by the Parties in this case, it has become clear that arbitral tribunals have
increasingly accepted the commercial realism of compound interest as the approach best
approximating the value lost by an investor. See, e.g., PSEG Global v. Republic of Turkey (ICSID
Case No. ARB/02/5); Siemens v. Republic of Argentina (\CSID Case No. ARB/02/8). For a very
thorough, though not exhaustive, review of ICSID precedents on this subject, see Compania de
Aguas de Aconquija et. al. v. Republic of Argentina (I\CSID Case No. ARB/97/3), para. 9.2.4 and
especially footnote 432. Also see generally, J. Colon and M. Knoll, “Pre-Judgment Interest in
International Arbitration,” University of Pennsylvania Paper 193 (2007), (Berkeley Electronic Press),

296.

the interest component from June 25, 2002 to October 31, 2008 is
$14,792,439.25 bringing the total actualized damage figure up to that date to
$53,592,439.25. The interest component of this amount shall be updated to the

date of the Award.

COSTS

Each party has pleaded that the costs of the arbitration and its own legal costs be
charged to the other party. Articles 40 and 41 of the Arbitration Rules provided
that the costs of arbitration and the legal costs of the parties shall be allocated to
the losing party. However, they permit that a tribunal decide otherwise after
consideration of all circumstances of the case. Taking into account all
circumstances of the instant case and the fact that the Claimant prevailed in the
jurisdiction phase of the proceedings, but neither party has fully prevailed in the
merits, the Tribunal decides that each party shall bear its own legal costs and
that the Respondent and the Claimant shall be responsible for 75% and 25%,
respectively, of fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of administration

of the ICSID Secretariat.

DECISION

Having carefully considered the Parties’ arguments in their written pleadings and
oral submissions and for the reasons above stated the Tribunal unanimously

decides that:

128

1.

Case 1:09-cv-00248-RBW Document1-2 Filed 02/06/2009 Page 131 of 133

Respondent has breached Article 2(2) of the Treaty by failing to accord fair and
equitable treatment, and protection and constant security to the investment of the

Claimant.

. Respondent shall therefore pay to the Claimant the sum of $53,592,439.25 updated

to the date of the Award in respect of the interest component.

. Pursuant to Articles 38 and 39 of the Arbitration Rules the costs of the arbitration

are fixed as follows:

(a) Fees and expenses of Dr. Andrés Rigo Sureda (President):
US$330,621.68.

(b) | Fees and expenses of Messrs. Whitney Debevoise (US$104,209.43) and
Judd Kessler (US$336,600): US$440,809.43.

(c) Fees and expenses of Prof. Alejandro Garro: US$302,724.35.

(d) Expenses prior to the administration by the ICSID Secretariat:
US$6,662.20.

(e) Administration fees and expenses of the ICSID Secretariat:
US$261,019.64.

The Respondent and the Claimant shall be responsible for 75% and 25%,
respectively, of the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the
administration costs both prior and during the administration of the case by the
ICSID Secretariat;

Each party shall bear its own costs and counsel fees;

All other claims are dismissed; and

Respondent shall pay to Claimant, on all amounts awarded pursuant to the

preceding paragraphs of this Award, interest at the average rate payable on six-

month U.S. Treasury bills from the date hereof until payment in full of this Award,

such interest to be compounded semi-annually. '”

‘22 While the subject of post-award interest remains a matter in which arbitral tribunals have adopted a
variety of approaches, the Tribunal considers that the function of post-award interest is essentially to
protect the value of the Award against inflation. For this reason we have chosen this rate, which has
been recognized as a “risk-free” rate.
