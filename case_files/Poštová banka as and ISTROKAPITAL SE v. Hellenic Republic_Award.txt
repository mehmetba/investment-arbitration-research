INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

1.

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Agreement between
the Government of the Hellenic Republic and the Government of the Czech and Slovak
Federal Republic for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated
June 3, 1991 (the “Slovakia-Greece BIT”), the Agreement between the Government of
the Hellenic Republic and the Government of the Republic of Cyprus on the Mutual
Promotion and Protection of Investments dated March 30, 1992 (the “Cyprus-Greece
BIT”) and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States
and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the

“ICSID Convention” or “ Washington Convention”).

The Claimants are Postova banka, a.s. (“PoStova banka”), a Slovak bank, and
Istrokapital SE (“Istrokapital”), a European Public Limited Liability Company,
organized under the laws of Cyprus (collectively “Claimants”). Istrokapital holds

shares in PoStova banka.!

Claimants are represented by Mr. David W. Rivkin and Ms. Samantha Rowe of the law
firm of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, New York, NY, USA and Mr. Marek Vojaéek,
Mr. DuSan Sedlaéek, Mr. Petr Briza of the law firm of Havel, Holasek & Partners s.r.o.,

Prague, Czech Republic.
Respondent is the Hellenic Republic (the “Respondent” or “Greece”).

Respondent is represented by Ms. Styliani Charitaki and Ms. Emmanuela Panopoulou,
Members of the Legal Council of the State, Athens, Greece, and Dr. Claudia Annacker
and Mr. Christopher Moore of the law firm of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP,

Paris, France and London, U.K.
Claimants and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Parties.”

' In their Memorial on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Claimants explained that in late
2011, Istrokapital and J&T Finance began discussing the possibility of Istrokapital selling its majority stake
in PoStova banka to J&T Finance. These discussions culminated in the transfer of interest in Postova banka
from Istrokapital to J&T Finance effective from July 1, 2013. C-Mem., { 77; Tarda Witness Statement, {[ 3.

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

7.

On May 3, 2013, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration dated May 2, 2013 from
Claimants (the “Request”). Following an enquiry by the ICSID Secretariat, Claimants

supplemented the Request with a letter dated May 17, 2013.

On May 20, 2013, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in
accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the
registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to
proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule
7(d) of the Centre’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and

Arbitration Proceedings.

On June 6, 2013, Respondent notified the Centre that it accepted Claimants’ proposal
in the Request concerning the number of arbitrators and method of constituting the
Tribunal. The Parties thus agreed to constitute the arbitral tribunal in accordance with
Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. Under their agreement, the Tribunal would
consist of three members: one arbitrator to be appointed by each party and the third
arbitrator, the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.
Failing such agreement, the President would be appointed by the Secretary-General of

ICSID.

On June 20, 2013, Claimants appointed as arbitrator Mr. John M. Townsend, a national

of the United States, who accepted his appointment on June 26, 2013.

On July 29, 2013, Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte Stern, a national of France,

as arbitrator. She accepted her appointment on July 31, 2013.

On September 6, 2013, the Parties informed the Secretary-General of ICSID that they
were unable to reach an agreement on the appointment of the President of the Tribunal.
In accordance with their agreement, the Parties requested that the Secretary-General

appoint the presiding arbitrator in consultation with the Parties.

13.

On September 9, 2013, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to submit their views
on the qualifications, experience and profile of potential candidates. By the same letter,
the Secretary-General proposed the following list-ranking procedure for appointing the

President:

i. The Secretary-General will send a list of seven to ten candidates and
requests that the Parties rank these candidates in order of preference [e.g.
first choice, second choice, third choice, etc.] with the first choice being
the most-preferred candidate. Each rank can only be used once. The

Parties may veto the appointment of one candidate on the list.

ii. Each party will complete its ranking within seven business days and return

it to ICSID by email without copying the opposing party.

iii. | ICSID will appoint the candidate with the least number of points to act as
the President of the Tribunal. If any candidates are tied with the lowest
number of points, ICSID will select the President from one of those

candidates.

By letters of September 11, 13 and 16, 2013, the Parties agreed to the list-ranking
procedure proposed by the Secretary-General and submitted their views on the

qualifications, experience and profile of potential candidates.

On September 26, 2013, the Secretary-General proposed ten candidates to the Parties.

The Parties submitted their rankings on October 7, 2013.

On October 7, 2013, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that ICSID would
proceed with the appointment of Mr. Eduardo Zuleta, the candidate with the least
number of points, to act as President of the Tribunal. Mr. Zuleta accepted his

appointment on October 21, 2013.

On October 21, 2013, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the
ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (“Arbitration Rules”) notified

the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the

20.

21.

Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Martina
Polasek, Team Leader/Legal Counsel, ICSID, was designated to serve as Secretary of

the Tribunal.

On December 17, 2013, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties by telephone
conference. The Parties’ agreements and the Tribunal’s determinations on the
procedural matters discussed at the first session were recorded in Procedural Order No.

1 of December 20, 2013.

Among other things, it was agreed that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those
in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural language would be English, that the
place of proceeding would be Washington, D.C. and that any ruling issued in the
proceeding would be published. The Parties further agreed that production of
documents would be governed by Article 3 of the International Bar Association Rules
on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (2010), except where
inconsistent with Procedural Order No. 1 or any later order of the Tribunal, in which
case, the orders of this Tribunal would prevail. Following the Parties’ agreement to
bifurcate jurisdiction from the merits, a procedural schedule on jurisdiction was

established.

After the issuance of Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties filed proposals for a
proceeding on the merits following a potential Decision on Jurisdiction. On January 9,
2014, considering the Parties’ proposals, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2

adopting a procedural calendar for a possible proceeding on the merits.

On January 17, 2014, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, Respondent filed a
request for the Tribunal to decide on its request for production of documents.
Respondent’s Redfern Schedule contained Claimants’ objections to production and
Respondent’s response to the objections. On January 21, 2014, following a request
granted by the Tribunal, Claimants filed further comments on the Respondent’s

requests for production.

28.

On January 22, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 ordering Claimants to
produce certain documents requested in Respondent’s Redfern Schedule. On January
23, 2014, Claimants confirmed that they would produce certain documents but that
they would not be able to produce the remaining documents within the set time frame

given the broad scope of the documents ordered for production.

On March 5, 2014, the Parties submitted a joint proposal for an amended procedural
calendar, which was adopted by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 4 of March 6,
2014.

On April 30, 2014, Claimants requested the Tribunal’s assistance in resolving an urgent
document production dispute between the Parties. They also requested that Respondent
be ordered to destroy or return a confidential document that had been produced

inadvertently.

On May 1, 2014, Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction. On the same day,
Respondent notified the Tribunal that it would refrain from submitting or relying on the
disputed or related documents identified by the Claimants in their letter of April 30,

2014, pending resolution of the matter by the Tribunal.

The Parties exchanged further correspondence concerning the documents at issue. On
May 23, 2014, the Centre informed the Parties that the Tribunal had received sufficient

information on the matter and did not require any further submissions.

On May 27, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, deferring the decision
on the relevant documents until after the filing of Claimants’ Memorial on the Merits
and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. It ordered that Respondent return the main
document to Claimants no later than May 30, 2014, without prejudice to the possibility
of Respondent requesting the disclosure of the document and related documents in

another document production phase, due to start on July 1, 2014.

On June 17, 2014, Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits and Counter-Memorial
on Jurisdiction, together with the witness statements of Messrs. Marek Tarda and

Ladislav Timiul’ak and an expert opinion by Professor René M. Stulz.

On July 1, 2014, Respondent renewed its request for the Tribunal to order the
production of the previously disputed documents. On July 8, 2014, Claimants objected
to Respondent’s second request, arguing that the documents were confidential and
protected by attorney-client privilege. The Parties exchanged further communications

on these matters by letters of July 11 and 17, 2014.

On July 20, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 concerning Respondent’s
second request for production of documents. It granted some of the requests for

production and denied others, as detailed in a Redfern Schedule attached to the Order.

On July 21, 2014, Respondent requested clarifications from the Tribunal with respect
to Procedural Order No. 6, which the Tribunal provided in a decision of July 23, 2014

entitled “Clarification to Procedural Order No. 6.”

On August 15, 2014, Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction, together with expert
reports of Professor R. Glen Hubbard and Professor Ray Ball.

On August 20, 2014, Claimants requested leave to submit a reply expert report of
Professor René M. Stultz, a reply witness statement of Mr. Marek Tarda as well as a
number of new exhibits. Claimants argued that Respondent had delayed the submission
of its expert evidence until its Reply on Jurisdiction in order to deny Claimants an

opportunity to respond.

On August 21, 2014, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the
Parties and, on August 22, 2014, issued Procedural Order No. 7 concerning the
outstanding procedural, administrative and logistical matters in preparation for the
Hearing on jurisdiction. By the same order, the Tribunal decided on Claimants’ request
of August 20, 2014, rejecting Claimants’ request to file a supplemental witness

statement and expert report.

A Hearing on jurisdiction took place in Washington, D.C. on September 8 and 9, 2014.
In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary of the Tribunal, present at

the Hearing were:

By letters of October 24 and 26, 2014, the Parties disputed the translations of exhibits
R-149 and R-150 and the redactions to Procedural Orders Nos. 5 and 6 and
Clarification to Procedural Order No. 6, which were requested by one of the Parties

before the publication of those orders.

On October 31 and November 6, 2014, Claimants and the Respondent filed their

respective Statements on Costs.

On November 4 and 10, 2014, the Parties filed additional submissions on the
translation and redaction issues. On November 12, 2014, the Tribunal decided to allow
the Claimants to submit their own translations of exhibits R-149 and R-150.
Additionally, the Tribunal ordered the publication on the ICSID website of redacted

versions of Procedural Orders No. 5 and 6 and Clarification to Procedural Order No. 6.

On November 18, 2014, in accordance with the Tribunal’s directions of November 12,
2014, Claimants submitted exhibits C-210 and C-211, as their translations of exhibits
R-149 and R-150.

On December 1, 2014, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it continued to engage in

deliberations.

On April 9, 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the proceeding was closed and

that the Award would be rendered on that date.

The Tribunal has conducted its deliberations in person and by various modes of
communication among its Members and in issuing this Award has taken into account
all written submissions and oral arguments of the Parties. The fact that a particular
reasoning, document or legal authority is not referred to in the following sections does

not mean that it has not been considered by the Tribunal.

Ill. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

44.

4S.

46.

47.

48.

The following section recalls the factual background of this dispute. As a preliminary
matter, the Tribunal notes that in this arbitration Claimants asserted that their rights
derive from the ownership by Po8tova banka of Greek Government Bonds (“GGBs”),”
whereas Respondent referred to such purchases by PoStovd banka as “interests in
GGBs.”? In light of the Tribunal’s decision, this distinction is not determinative. The
Tribunal will thus refer to GGBs and interests in GGBs (or GGB interests) indistinctly

in this decision.

The Greek Financial Crisis

The Hellenic Republic has been a Member State of the European Union (“EU”) and the
Euro Area since 2001.

Due to the global financial crisis of 2008, Greece experienced a significant economic
downturn. In 2009, rating agencies downgraded Greek debt, given, among other
factors, the country’s public debt burden.> Among the obligations of the Greek
Government that were downgraded were five series of Greek Government Bonds, held

at various times by PoStova banka, as described below.

On January 15, 2010, Greece submitted to the European Commission a three-year
stability program to reduce its fiscal deficit within the EU limit, which was adopted by
the European Commission on February 3, 2010 and was supported by the Heads of
State and Government of the EU. This program was followed by the adoption of

austerity measures by Greece on March 3, 2010.°

On April 11, 2010, the Euro Area Member States agreed on financial support for the

Hellenic Republic and the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”) contributed additional

funds in order to secure the financial stability of the Euro Area. The activation of this

mechanism was formally requested on April 23, 2010.

On April 27, 2010, Standard & Poor’s lowered Greece’s long-term credit rating from
BBB+ to BB+.’ European Union and Greek leaders affirmed that restructuring was not

on the table.®

Later, on May 2, 2010, an adjustment program was launched to increase financial
support to Greece, conditioned upon the implementation of fiscal, financial and
structural measures, set out ina Memorandum of Economic and Fiscal Policies of May
3, 2010, agreed with the IMF, the Eurogroup, the European Commission and the

European Central Bank.?
Postova Banka’s Interests in GGBs

While these events were unfolding, PoStova banka purchased in early 2010 a number of
GGBs issued by the Hellenic Republic between 2007 and 2010. The bonds purchased
by PoStova banka belonged to five series of GGBs, all of which were governed by

Greek law:

decision of the Minister of Economy and Finance and the Governor of the Bank of

GGBs were dematerialized securities. '°

Law 2198 of 1994 created the System for Monitoring Transactions in a Book-entry
Securities (“System”), administered by the Bank of Greece in order to monitor the
loans on behalf of the Government of Greece.!” In accordance with Article 6 of Law

or natural persons (Participants) defined either by category or by name are eligible for
membership in the System, subject to approval by the a Bank of Greece Governor's Act

Law as “investors”).!? A Participant is required to have two types of accounts, one for

its customer portfolio and the other for its own account. Payments made to Greece on
account of GGBs were only made by Participants as the system was envisioned as one

of “delivery versus payment.”?°

The GGBs were issued by the Greek Government through the Bank of Greece System
to the Participants in the System. Participants deliver the bonds to the Primary Dealers,
which ultimately provide the funds for the acquisition by Participants, and in turn, sell
the GGBs on the secondary market. The distribution of bonds occurred electronically

through universal depositories, such as Clearstream.”!

The initial distribution process is completed once the Primary Dealers distributed the
interests in the GGBs into the secondary market, which usually happened within one or

two days of their issuance.?*

PoStova banka used capital from consumer deposits to acquire €504,000,000 aggregate
face principal amount of GGBs interests through a series of transactions between

January 8, 2010 and April 23, 2010.73

The series of GGBs in which PoStova banka acquired interests were governed by Greek
Jaw and matured at various dates between March 20, 2012 and June 19, 2020. None of

them contained Collective Action Clauses.”4

PoStova banka’s interests in the GGBs were held in book-entry form in an account with
Clearstream Banking, a corporation organized under the laws of Luxembourg
(“Clearstream”). This account did not entitle PoStova banka to rights in any specific

instrument, but only to rights in a pool of fungible interests.”°
Developments After Postové Banka’s Purchases of GGBs

During 2010 and 2011, Greece paid the interest due on its bonds. PoStova banka

received payment of the principal for GGBs that matured in 2011.27

In July 2011, GGBs were further downgraded by the bond rating agencies.”* At that
time, the IMF had concluded that a significant funding gap had to be closed at least in
part through “Private Sector Involvement” (“PSI”).”? PSI is a polite circumlocution for
requiring private holders of government debt to accept some reduction in the principal

or the interest, or both, due on that debt.

As Greece’s situation continued to deteriorate, a second adjustment program was
adopted by the European Union and EU institutions on July 21, 2011.*° This program
would have combined a second bail-out with “voluntary contribution of the private
sector” in order to fully cover the financing gap.*! However, this program was never

implemented.**

The Greek and the Euro Area authorities conducted consultations with the private

sector regarding the PSI during the following months.

On October 26, 2011, the Euro Area Heads of State officially stated:

“The Private Sector Involvement (PSI) has a vital role in establishing the
sustainability of the Greek debt. Therefore we welcome the current discussion
between Greece and its private investors to find a solution for a deeper PSI.
Together with an ambitious reform programme for the Greek economy, the PSI
should secure the decline of the Greek debt to GDP ratio with an objective of
reaching 120% by 2020. To this end we invite Greece, private investors and all
parties concerned to develop a voluntary bond exchange with a nominal
discount of 50% on national Greek debt held by private investors. The Euro zone
Member States would contribute to the PSI package up to 30 bn euro. On that
basis, the official sector stands ready to provide additional programme financing
of up to 100 bn euro until 2014, including required recapitalisation of Greek
banks. The new programme should be agreed by the end of 2011 and the
exchange of bonds should be implemented at the beginning of 2012. We call on
the IMF to continue to contribute to the financing of the new Greek

programme.”*?

On November 2011, a Steering Committee was created by the Private Creditor-Investor
Committee to conduct negotiations on a voluntary PSI for Greece with the Greek and
Euro Area authorities. PoStova banka was not a Member of the Private Creditor-

Investor Committee or its Steering Committee.**

On February 21, 2012, the Eurogroup announced an increase in the financial package
for Greece, in which it acknowledged the common understanding reached with the
private sector on the general terms of the PSI, whereby a nominal “haircut” of 53.3% of
the face value of the Greek debt was provided for.*> Financial support was conditioned
upon the implementation of the debt exchange in a Memorandum of Understanding

between the European Commission and Greece entered into on March 1, 2012.°°

The Greek Bondholder Act

67. The Greek Bondholder Act — Law 4050/2012 — was approved by the Greek Parliament

on February 23, 2012. The Greek Bondholder Act provided that “/t]he Ministerial
Council upon recommendation of the Minister of Finance shall decide on the

commencement of the modification process of the eligible titles by the Bondholders”

and would likewise determine which would be the eligible titles, the principal or
nominal amount of the interest rate, the duration and applicable law of the new titles.*”
The Public Debt Management Agency — PDMA - was authorized to issue one or more
invitations on behalf of the Greek Government, whereby Bondholders would be invited
to decide whether or not they accepted the modification proposed by Greece.** This
Act also provided that the exchange would become binding on all eligible GGBs
governed by Greek law if two conditions were met: (i) participation of at least one half
of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all eligible titles, and (ii) vote in favor
of the exchange of at least two thirds of the aggregate principal amount of participating
GGBs.* This Act effected a significant change in the Greek law governing the GGBs,
by permitting the terms of the bonds to be changed if the requisite number of holders of

the bonds consented to the change.

68. Titles eligible for the type of exchange authorized by the Greek Bondholder Act were
defined in a decision of the Greek Ministerial Council of February 24, 2012. The five

series of GGBs at issue in this arbitration were included in that decision.*°
The Restructuring and Consent Solicitation

69. On February 24, 2012, Greece initiated a sovereign debt restructuring which would be
implemented through an exchange of outstanding GGBs for new titles.*! These new
titles were to consist of a combination of (i) new GGBs issued by the Hellenic
Republic in a face amount of 31.5% of the nominal amount of the exchanged GGBs;
(ii) European Financial Stability Facility Notes with a maturity date of 2 years or less in
nominal amount equal to 15% of the face amount of the exchanged GGBs; and (iii)
detachable GDP-linked securities in a notional amount equal to the face amount of the

new GGBs; and (iv) 6-month European Financial Stability Facility Notes (“EFSF

Notes”) in respect of the interest accrued on each tendered GGB.* This restructuring
was subject to the approval of the exchange of securities by the holders of the specified

majority of eligible GGBs in the Bondholder Act.

70. The Consent Solicitation by which the approval of the exchange by the holders of
GGBs was launched on February 24, 2012 and was due to expire at 9:00 p.m. C.E.T on
March 8, 2012.4

71. The Consent Solicitation was launched through an Invitation Memorandum, addressed
to “Bondholders or holders of Designated Securities,” which included “each beneficial
owner of the Designated Securities holding Designated Securities, directly or
indirectly, in an account in the name of a Direct Participant acting on such beneficial
owner’s behalf.“4 Only Participants were authorized to submit Participation

Instructions in accordance with the Invitation Memorandum.*>

72. During early March, Greek officials made public declarations to explain that the PST
offer, launched through the Consent Solicitation, was the only available offer to
bondholders.*° In a press release published on March 6, 2012, Greece’s Public Debt

Management Agency stated:

“The Republic’s representative noted that Greece’s economic programme does
not contemplate the availability of funds to make payments to private sector
creditors that decline to participate in PSI. Finally, the Republic's representative
noted that if PSI is not successfully completed, the official sector will not finance
Greece’s economic programme and Greece will need to restructure its debt
(including guaranteed bonds governed by Greek law) on different terms that will
not include co-financing, the delivery of EFSF notes, GDP linked securities or
the submission to English law.’”*”

On March 7, 2012, PoStova banka’s Board of Directors voted not to accept the
exchange proposed in the Consent Solicitation.** Po&tova banka therefore instructed

Clearstream to vote against the exchange.”

On March 9, 2012, the results of the Consent Solicitation were announced:
Approximately 91.5% of the eligible GGBs had participated and approximately
94.23% of the participating GGBs had voted in favor of the exchange.”

Thus, on March 12, 2012, new securities were delivered.*! At the same time, Postova
banka received the new securities in its account with Clearstream, and the GGBs it had
previously held in that account were removed from its account pursuant to the

Bondholder Act.

On April 2, 2012, PoStova banka sold on the secondary market the EFSF notes that it
had received in the exchange. PoStova banka retains the new bonds and GDP-linked

securities received in the exchange.
Postové Banka’s Accounting for the GGBs

International accounting standards required PoStova banka to classify bonds or other
investments securities for accounting purposes as “held for trading” (“HFT”), “held to
maturity” (“HTM”) and “available for sale” (“AFS”). Bonds classified as HFT are
acquired principally for resale in the near term; they are carried in a bank’s books at
market prices and reflected in the bank’s profit and loss statement. HTM bonds reflect
the intent of the owner to hold them until maturity; they are carried at amortized costs
so that market fluctuations do not affect their value. Except in limited circumstances, if
bonds classified as HMT are sold or reclassified, all other assets in the HMT portfolio

would have to be reclassified as AFS and remain in the AFS portfolio for the next two

years.°* Bonds classified as AFS are carried at their market price and can be sold prior

to their maturity.**

Initially, most of these interests in GGBs were classified in Postova banka’s AFS
portfolio.** The vast majority of these interests were reclassified on April 1, 2010 from

AFS to HTM.*>

Under the international accounting rules applicable to debt and equity investments,
GGBs could have also been classified in the HFT portfolio, where they are held for

short-term trading. Postova banka never classified any of its GGBs as HFT.*°

On April 19, 2010, the Hellenic Republic made its last bond issuance prior to the
Bondholder Act.>’

During 2011, PoStova banka sold the entirety of its GGB interests in its AFS portfolio,
comprising three of the five series of GGB interests it had bought (ISIN
GR0124032666, ISIN GRO114023485 and ISIN GR0114020457). Later on, PoStova
banka purchased GGB interests of the same series and in the same principal amounts,

though for different prices.**
The Agreements Concerning Postové Banka’s Interests in GGBs

In October 2011, the National Bank of Slovakia (“NBS”), in its capacity as regulator of
Slovak banks, requested a meeting with PoStova banka to discuss the “development of
the financial situation of Postova Banka in 2011 as regards the Bank’s exposure to

Greek government bonds.” One of the alternatives presented by PoStova banka was to

transfer the risk from part of the GGBs portfolio to a shareholder of PoStova banka or

to another person.*?

83. On December 22, 2011, Istrokapital (PoStova banka’s majority shareholder) and J&T
Finance, a.s., (“J&T Finance’), a company incorporated under the laws of the Czech
Republic, signed a Framework Share Purchase Agreement (“FSPA”) specifying the
terms for the acquisition by J&T Finance of Istrokapital’s shares in PoStova banka.
J&T Finance and Istrokapital agreed that, notwithstanding the sale of shares, the risk
associated with the GGBs would be ultimately borne by Istrokapital.© Under the
FSPA, Istrokapital remained responsible for ensuring PoStova banka’s capital adequacy
in case it were affected by a situation with the GGBs and Istrokapital assumed also the
obligation to compensate J&T Finance if the return on the value of the GGBs did not

reach the acquisition cost.°!

84. On December 23, 2011, PoStova banka and J&T Finance entered into two assignment
agreements, whereby PoStova banka assigned “Part of the Receivable” to J&T Finance
(the “Assignment Agreements”). The “Receivable” was an amount of the principal and
interest of GGBs that PoStova banka then held, to be determined according to Greece’s
level of payment of the interests in GGBs to PoStova banka, either on the effective due

date of the GGBs or on any earlier date on which they were paid.

© The subject of the Assignment Agreements is the obligation of the Assignor to assign to the Assignee “Part
of Receivable” and the obligation of the Assignee to pay the Assignor recompense for assigning Part of the
Receivable. “Part of the Receivable” is defined in the corresponding agreement on the basis of payment
received by PoStova banka on the due date of the receivable. Three events were envisioned by the parties: (a)
If on the Due Date, the Hellenic Republic does not pay the Receivable even partially, then Part of the
Receivable means the right to be paid part of the Principal in the amount of 50% together with the right to be
paid part of the Interest in the amount of 50%; (b) If on the Due Date, the Hellenic Republic pays the
Receivable partially, but the payment is lower than or equal to 50% of the value of the Receivable, then Part
of the Receivable means the right to be paid the unpaid part of the Principal in the amount of 50% together
with the right to be paid part of the Interest in the amount of 50%; (c) If, on the Due Date, the Hellenic
Republic pays the Receivable partially and the payment is higher than 50% of the value of the Receivable,
then Part of the Receivable means the right to be paid the entire unpaid part of the Principal and the unpaid
Interest. See R-149 and R-150, Articles I and II.

In turn, J&T Finance would compensate PoStova banka for assigning such receivables
in the amount of their nominal value. In addition, J&T Finance would deposit funds in
PoStova banka under related deposit agreements dated December 23, 2011 (the
“Deposit Agreements”). These funds were not to be used by J&T Finance during the
term of the commitment (i.e, from the date of deposit until August 27, 2012), and
would be paid to J&T Finance upon the expiry of the term.® On the day of expiry of
the term of commitment, PoStova banka would pay the Deposit and interest thereon in

the amount of 7.5% to J&T Finance.

On December 23, 2011, J&T Finance and Istrokapital entered into two assignment
agreements pursuant to which J&T Finance would assign to Istrokapital Part of the
Receivable previously assigned by PoStova banka to J&T Finance. Once they were
assigned to J&T Finance, Istrokapital would in turn pay compensation in the amount of
the nominal value of the Part of the Receivable that was assigned to it. Istrokapital’s
obligation to recompense is set off by J&T’s obligation to credit Istrokapital, pursuant
to the credit agreement previously entered into between these two parties. These
agreements would become effective on the effective date of the Assignment

Agreements.

The Assignment Agreements were later amended by an agreement of the Parties in mid
February 2012 in order to replace the definition of “Part of the Receivable.” The
amended assignment agreements increased the amounts of the “Part of the Receivable”
to be paid pursuant to the Assignment Agreements. PoStova banka and J&T Finance
entered into further deposit agreements on account of the amendments to the

Assignment Agreements.

On March 8, 2012, Istrokapital, J&T Finance and Postova banka entered into an
“Agreement on a Deposit into Other Equity Accounts and on Settlement of

Obligations” (the “Settlement Agreement”). The Settlement Agreement provides that

it cancels and extinguishes all obligations of PoStova banka and J&T Finance under the
Assignment Agreements as of the entry into effect of the Settlement Agreement.*” The
four Deposit Agreements entered into between PoStova banka and J&T Finance were
terminated early and PoStova banka would not reimburse J&T Finance the deposits and
accessions. Also, J&T Finance assigned the right to receive repayment of the deposits
made with PoStova banka to Istrokapital and Istrokapital would make an equity deposit
corresponding to the repayment of the deposit to PoStova banka and set off this

contribution against receivables assigned by J&T Finance.

The Settlement Agreement required three conditions to enter into effect: (i) the delivery
of a notification by Clearstream stating that new issues of Greek bonds had been
credited to PoStova banka’s account; (ii) a decision by PoStova banka’s Board of

Directors, and (iii) prior consent of Po&tova banka’s Supervisory Board.®

On the same date, J&T Finance and Istrokapital also entered into a Settlement
Agreement pursuant to which J&T Finance assigned the receivables it had against
Postova banka to Istrokapital, which in turn agreed to pay compensation to J&T

Finance for the amounts deposited in PoStova banka.

OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION

Respondent submitted the following jurisdictional objections:

i. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae because (a) PoStova
banka’s interests in GGBs are not protected investments under the Slovakia-
Greece BIT and the ICSID Convention; and (b) Istrokapital never made an
investment protected under the Cyprus-Greece BIT or the ICSID

Convention.”

iv. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Claimants’ umbrella clause claims

In their Memorial on Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Claimants
submitted both their responses to Respondent’s jurisdictional objections and their
arguments on the merits. Since this decision will solely address the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction, Claimants’ arguments on the merits will not be summarized below.

submissions and during the Hearing. Following is a summary of the position of the

Parties with respect to each such jurisdictional objection.

Postové Banka Does Not Have a Protected Investment

Postova banka’s GGB interests are not protected investments under the Slovakia-

investments under Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT and do not qualify as

investments under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Claimants conflate GGBs with
interests in GGBs”*: Postova banka never held GGBs and it was never a Participant in
the System; instead it acquired a stake in a pool of freely negotiable, fungible interests
by Clearstream in secondary market transactions.’ As a holder of GGB interests,
PoStova banka was in contractual privity with Clearstream and not with the Hellenic

Republic.”°

96. Respondent holds that in order for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction ratione materiae,
Claimants must establish the existence of an investment both under the Slovakia-
Greece BIT and the ICSID Convention for, as stated in Phoenix v. Czech Republic,

“ICSID’s tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae ‘rests on the intersection of the two

definitions.”””°

97. Greece considers that the term ‘investment’ in Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention
has an objective meaning that cannot be expanded or derogated by agreement between
the Parties.””7 A long line of ICSID cases, subject to minor variations, has established
four cumulative criteria to determine whether an investment was made for the purposes
of Article 25 (1) of the Convention’*: “(i) a contribution in money or other assets, (ii) a
significant duration, (iii) an element of risk, and (iv) a contribution to the economic

development of the host State or an operation made in order to develop an economic

73 In its Reply on Jurisdiction, Greece points to the differences between GGBs and GGB interests: GGBs are
issued by the Hellenic Republic and purchased by Participants in the System, where they are held.
Participants are the only holders of GGBs and they are in contractual privity with the Hellenic Republic. The
price of GGBs is determined solely at the time of the bond issuance. GGB interests, in turn, are created by
Participants and purchased by Primary Dealers who sell them in the secondary market. Holders of GGB
interests do not participate in the BoG system and they are in contractual privity with the International
Clearing System accounts where interests are deposited. The price of GGB interests and its inherent risks
may change fundamentally as they are traded. See Rep., {[ 188.

activity in the host State.” The last requirement has been considered implicit in the

other three elements by certain tribunals.*”

Greece considers that contrary to Claimants’ assertions, debt instruments do not
automatically meet these criteria! This assessment shall be made on a case-by-case
basis.** Further, Respondent states that in none of the cases cited by Claimants for the
proposition that investment should be understood in a broad manner, the tribunals
dispensed with the analysis of whether the alleged investment met certain criteria
pertaining to the objective definition of investment.® Particularly, Respondent
highlights that in Fedax v. Venezuela,* the tribunal stressed that the promissory notes
at issue were not volatile capital and that the decisions in Abaclat v. Argentina®> and

Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina®® were accompanied by strong dissenting opinions.*”

As to the definition of investment under Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT,
Respondent argues that it has an inherent meaning that entails a contribution to the host
State of a significant duration that involves an element of risk.** These objective
requirements derive from the ordinary meaning of the term investment, the context of
Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, which includes Article 10 of the BIT
providing for ICSID arbitration, the treaty’s object and purpose and the objective

definition of the term under international law.*? Citing to Romak v. Uzbekistan” and

Alps Finance v. Slovak Republic?! Respondent asserts that assets listed under Article 1
(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT cannot be deemed as investments if they do not satisfy
the objective requirements mentioned above.*” Further, Respondent distinguishes a
bond from a loan in so far as loans imply contractual privity and are usually tied to a

specific operation or to an underlying investment in the host State.?*

100. Respondent asserts that Claimants attempt to invoke Article 31(4) of the VCLT to
replace the ordinary meaning of the term “investment” is unavailing. Claimants bear
the burden of proving that the State parties to the BIT ascribed a special meaning to the
term investment that deviates from the ordinary meaning of the term in its context, as
indicated by Article 31(1) of the VCLT, and they have failed to demonstrate it.**
Respondent, in turn, has derived the requirements of the term “investment” from its
ordinary meaning, interpreted in context and in light of the treaty’s object and purpose,
which cannot be limited to the protection of foreign investments for it also includes the
stimulus of foreign investment and the accompanying flow of capital in order to
develop the Contracting States’ economies.”° Under this interpretation, the equation of
the term investment with “every kind of asset” is not consistent with the object and
purpose of the Slovakia-Greece BIT.*° Further, Claimants’ proposition that falling into
one of the categories of assets of Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT suffices for
an investment, would lead to unreasonable results and to the inclusion of one-off

transactions as investments.””

Responding to arguments advanced by Claimants, Greece conveys that contrary to the
Ttaly-Argentina BIT that was applied in the Abaclat v. Argentina and Ambiente Ufficio

v. Argentina cases, neither the Slovakia-Greece BIT nor the Cyprus-Greece BIT

Slovakia-Greece BIT and other Greek BITs that do expressly include bonds, only refer
to corporate bonds, whose nature is distinct from that of sovereign bonds.®? Thus, the
fact that the Slovakia-Greece BIT and the Cyprus-Greece BIT include corporate bonds
and not sovereign bonds indicates that the Parties did not intend to extend investment

treaty protection to the latter kind of assets.!°°

102. Hence, Respondent posits that PoStova banka’s purchases of GGB interests do not meet
the necessary requirements to qualify as an investment under Article 25(1) of the

ICSID Convention and Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT.

103. First, Respondent argues that PoStova banka’s purchases of GGB interests did not
result in a contribution to the Hellenic Republic’s economy. Greece argues that
contribution of an investment to the host State’s economy is necessary for an
investment to benefit from protection under the ICSID Convention and an investment
treaty, as this is the quid pro quo of the investor’s right to resort to international
arbitration.'°! This proposition is supported in the preambles of the Slovakia-Greece
BIT and the ICSID Convention, which evidence that the State parties aimed to
encourage and protect international investment made for the purpose of contributing to
the economy of the host State, in academic writings, as well as in the decisions in
Caratube v. Kazakhstan,'°? Phoenix v. Czech Republic and Nations Energy v.

Panama.'°3

104. Second, Respondent argues that PoStova banka’s purchases of GGB interests were
secondary market transactions which did not involve flow of funds to the Hellenic

Republic. The only flow of funds to Greece occurred when the bonds were issued and

were paid by the Primary Dealers. Therefore, any payment made by Postova banka did
not involve a contribution to or a relevant economic activity within the Hellenic

Republic.!*

Third, Respondent argues that PoStova banka’s purchases of GGBs were speculative
commercial transactions that did not involve any investment risk or any term
commitment of resources. According to Respondent, “PoStova Banka’s GGB interests
were freely negotiable, high risk, short-term financial instruments, which did not
involve any investment risk or any term commitment of financial resources on the part

of Postova Banka.”!°

In fact, Respondent says, interests in GGBs do not imply a different risk from that of
ordinary commercial transactions;!°° they did not involve any risk sharing of
operational risk.'°7 Greece points to Romak v. Uzbekistan, where the tribunal
established that an investment risk was distinct from the pure commercial risk of non-
performance of a contract, to establish that investment risk entails uncertainty as to
returns and expenditures, even if all parties fulfill their contractual obligations. !°° The
fact that default risk has a special quality due to the sovereign character of the issuer
does not make this an investment risk.!°? Respondent also argues that sovereign bonds
do not involve an element of risk sharing required for assets to be protected as an

investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.!!°

In addition, Greece holds that PoStova banka made no term commitment of financial
resources. Certain duration of the investment is required for its protection under the

Slovakia-Greece BIT.!!! Postova banka acquired interests in GGBs that could be sold

at any moment in the secondary market!!? so that by their very nature they do not meet

the duration requirement.'!?

108. Respondent argues that the intended duration of the commitment should be
considered.''* Postova banka acquired these interests with the intention of reselling
them in the near future, but then reclassified them from its AFS to its HTM portfolio in
order to achieve higher cash flows as a result of the 2010 bail-out by the EU and the
IMF and to protect Postova banka’s balance sheet.!!> This sole reclassification, which
was based on speculation and on a change of intent by the bank,!'® does not suffice to
convert interests in GGBs into investments of a certain duration.!!’ Respondent cites
the decision in KT Asia v. Kazakhstan''® where the tribunal found that acquisition of
shares with the intention to sell them in the short term did not meet the duration

requirement because it did not involve a long-term contribution of resources.!!?

109. Postova banka’s intention to exploit the price volatility of the GGB interests due to
Greece’s financial situation is further evidenced by its decision to sell and then
repurchase GGB interests in the exact same series during 2011.!”° These transactions
underscore the speculative nature of the operation and the lack of economic activity in

the host country. !7!

110. Finally, Respondent claims that the territorial nexus required for investments to be
protected under the Slovakia-Greece BIT and the ICSID Convention is absent in
Postova banka’s GGB interests. The preamble and several provisions of the Slovakia-

Greece BIT are premised on the making of investments in the territory of the host

State.!??

Therefore, this BIT does not cover investments made outside the territory of
the Hellenic Republic. Similarly, the Hellenic Republic’s consent to ICSID arbitration
is limited to investments made in its territory. Notwithstanding an express limitation in
Article 10 of the BIT, this provision is limited to the same subject matter as the rest of

the treaty.!2°

In this same sense, the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention signals that for
investments to be within the scope of Article 25(1), they must be made in the territory

of the respondent State.'*

112. Secondary market purchases of interests in sovereign bonds lack territorial connection
with the host State. This transaction did not involve inflow of funds into Greece and
were not linked to any business undertaking in the Hellenic Republic.' PoStova
banka’s interests were held in accounts in Clearstream, maintained in Luxembourg and

governed by Luxembourg law.!?°

113. Moreover, Claimants have not established that the purchase of GGB interests in the
secondary market involved a flow of funds into the Hellenic Republic, because “the
sums paid to the Hellenic Republic by the underwriters cannot possibly be
characterized as ‘advance payments’ of the purchase price paid by Postova Banka in
the course of the GGB interests’ ordinary trading, long after completion of the bond
issuance and distribution process.”'?! These purchases could not have benefited Greece
since, at the time they were made, Respondent had no primary market for GGBs.!?8

Holders of GGBs are not parties to any ‘loans’ in the terms of Article 1(1)(c) of the

Slovakia-Greece BIT for “/i/f the subscription of GGBs themselves could be compared

with a ‘loan,’ the subscription agreements in relation to the bond issuances would have

been concluded by the Primary Dealers, not Postova Banka.”'”? The situs of interests
in immobilized securities is the place where the clearer is established, thus PoStova
banka only had a right to payment against Clearstream, and these claims were situated

in Luxembourg and not in Greece.!*°

114. In its Reply on Jurisdiction, Greece responded to assertions by Claimants concerning
the nature of their investment. In the first place, Greece stated that the Invitation
Memorandum cannot change the fact that only Participants in the System are
considered the legal owners of the GGBs; only Participants were allowed to submit

Participation Instructions.'*!

115. In addition, Respondent contests the application of the “unity of investment” theory to
establish jurisdiction over transactions conducted in the secondary market for the
purchase of GGB interests. PoStova banka’s purchases were not ancillary to or an
implementation of an overall investment made by Claimants in Greece.!** Instead,

Claimants “seek to piggy back on the alleged original contributions made by unrelated

 

133 Postova banka’s purchases did

 

third parties in the original bond issuance proce.
not form an integral part of the original bond issuances, because the bank purchased

interests in the secondary market long after the distribution process was complete.

116. Greece distinguishes the situation of claimants in Abaclat v. Argentina and Ambiente
Uffizio v. Argentina, where the tribunals found that the purchase of security
entitlements constitutes a protected investment because these purchases resulted
indirectly in economic benefit or flow of funds to the State.'*+ The Hellenic Republic
did not receive any of the purchase price paid by PoStova banka for its GGB interests,
either directly or as an “advance payment.” Based on Professor Hubbard’s report,

Respondent assert that from an economic perspective, the interests acquired by PoStova

118.

banka, long after the end of the distribution period, were fundamentally different from

the instruments involved in the distribution process. !*5

Respondent then suggests that, in any case, Claimants’ purchases of GGB interests are
too remote from the GGBs issuance process to be considered to give rise to a dispute
arising directly out of an investment. Claimants’ purchases of the interests in GGBs
were structured in a way that had no effect on the price for the issuer.!*° At the time of
purchase by Claimants, Greece no longer had access to the primary market; transfers in
the secondary market had no effect on the primary market since the pricing of GGBs
was dependent on potential bail-outs to Greece.!*’ This remote and disconnected
secondary market did not provide any benefit to the Hellenic Republic.'** Based on
Enron y. Argentina’ and PSEG v. Turkey,'*° Respondent argues that even if interests
in GGBs and GGBs were not to be considered separate financial instruments, claims
based on PoStova banka’s trades in the secondary market are beyond the cut-off point
at which claims are permissible, because they are too distant from the underlying

investment.'4!

In its Reply on Jurisdiction and during the Hearing, Respondent asserted that PoStova
banka’s behavior involved a form of regulatory arbitrage, “(...) namely, the purchase
of high yield GGB interests (and yet with a disproportionate risk-weighting) with a
view to selling them when their yields converged with other financial instruments (i.e.,

when the price of the GGB interests increased).”'

Istrokapital Does Not Have a Protected Investment

119. Respondent also argues that Istrokapital never made a protected investment under the

Cyprus-Greece BIT or the ICSID Convention.

12

S

Respondent argues that as a shareholder of PoStova banka, Istrokapital does not have
any legal right to the company’s assets and thus may not base the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction on the GGB interests that belong to Postova banka.'*? In this regard,
Respondent notes that a company is a legal entity different from its shareholders and

that the property of the former is distinct from that of the latter.'##

121.

Citing to GAMI v. Mexico,'* BG Group v. Argentina," El Paso v. Argentina'*’ and
ST-AD v. Bulgaria,'*® Respondent argues that a shareholder has no enforceable right in
arbitration over the assets of the company in which it holds shares, but only over its

shares in the company. '4?

122. Consequently, in order to enforce its claim, Istrokapital would have to prove that its
shareholding in PoStova banka is protected under the Cyprus-Greece BIT and that the
measures allegedly taken against the Greek Bonds in contravention of the Cyprus-
Greece BIT impaired the value of Istrokapital’s shares.'*’ According to Respondent,
Istrokapital cannot claim that its shareholding in a Slovak company, such as PoStova

banka, qualifies as a protected investment under the Cyprus-Greece BIT, as it has no

property right or activity whatsoever in Greek territory.!>!

123. In its Reply on Jurisdiction, Respondent notes that the cases invoked by Claimants
actually support Respondent’s contention that a tribunal may only exercise jurisdiction
on the basis of claimants’ shareholding in a local company — even if such shareholding

is indirect — but not on account of the local company’s assets. !*?

124. Moreover, in explaining the differences between the circumstances addressed in the

153 and Azurix v. Argentina'™* cases cited by Claimants,

Siemens v. Argentina
Respondent indicates that, in order to claim protection of an investment under the
relevant treaty, the claimant must show an active involvement in the act of investing. '*>
Since, by Claimants’ own admission, Istrokapital had no part in the acquisition and
management of PoStova banka’s GGB interests, it cannot claim to have indirectly

invested in the bonds.'*°

125. Finally, Respondent stresses that, contrary to Claimants’ contention, there is a
fundamental difference between an indirect shareholding in a company and the assets
of such company. In this regard, Respondent explains that, while the shareholding
confers rights to participation in certain decisions affecting the company, it is the
company itself that owns and manages its assets.!°’ Therefore, investment treaty
protection is generally conferred to the claimant’s participation in a domestic company
for derivative or reflective losses in the value of its shares, but not for losses to the

domestic company and its assets in themselves.!>*

126. In regard to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Istrokapital, Respondent further refers to its
arguments that PoStova banka’s GGB interests are not protected under the Cyprus-

Greece BIT or the ICSID Convention.'*’ On this subject, Respondent stresses that (i)

the GGB interests do not display the elements of contribution to the host State, risk
sharing and duration that belong to the “inherent” meaning of the term “investment” in
the context of investment treaty arbitration,'® and (ii) that the GGB interests cannot be
considered an investment made “in the territory” of Greece as required by the Cyprus-

Greece BIT.'®!

b. Claimants’ Position

PoStové Banka Has a Protected Investment

n

Claimants assert that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione materiae under the broad
definitions of investment in the Slovakia-Greece BIT and in the Cyprus-Greece BIT
because GGBs are assets comprising a loan to the Greek Government, a claim to
money, and the right to performance under a contract having financial value under
Article 1.1(c) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT and are assets, comprising monetary claims
and contractual claims with economic value under Article 1.1(c) of the Cyprus-Greece
BIT.'® According to Claimants, this language “clearly encompasses a sovereign bond,
and the rights to that bond that were taken away by Greece’s forced surrender of our
client’s bonds. Certainly a bond is a monetary claim. It’s a monetary claim to coupon
payments and to payment of the principal on maturity.”'® Claimants submit that,
contrary to Respondent’s suggestion, there is no relevant difference between a bond

and a loan.'*

od

Claimants consider that Greece’s interpretation of the term “investment” is inconsistent
with the language and the object and purpose of the BITs. Article 31 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of the Treaties governs the Tribunal’s interpretation of the
BITs!® and Greece overlooks that Article 31(4) VCLT provides that a special meaning

shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended. Thus, instead of

resorting to a restrictive dictionary definition,'® Respondent should have consulted the

definition of ‘investment’ in each treaty.!°”

129. In fact, “[d]efinitional sections in treaties obviously may provide express elaborations
of particular meanings that Parties intended to give certain terms.”!°* Where a treaty
defines a given term, this definition overrides any other meaning that could be given to

such term.!©?

130. The definitions of “investment” in the treaties do not contain the limitations advanced

by Greece. In both cases, the State parties defined the term carefully, providing a broad
general definition as every kind of asset and a list of examples of what would constitute
an investment for the purpose of the treaty. The cap of the definition includes language
that shows that investment means every kind of asset without limitations, and there was
no need to define sovereign bonds specifically because they are included in monetary
and contractual claims.'’? Claimants rebut the notion proposed by Greece of some
concept of “investment” under international law that is different from treaty definitions.
If such a concept were to exist, “it would no doubt account for the fact that most
contemporary treaties refer in broad terms to every kind of asset, including those to

which Greece is a party.”!7!

131. These general definitions are consistent with the object and purpose of the treaties, as

2

elucidated in their preambles,'” specifically in the reference to the creation of

favorable conditions for investments of investors.'”* In any case, a treaty’s object and
purpose cannot be used to read out an express definition in its text.'”* Claimants argue

that “/iJn so doing, the parties to each BIT clearly intended to give a special meaning

to the term ‘investment’ and to ensure that, at a minimum, any kind of asset that they

enumerated would fall within that meaning.”'?

132. GGBs fall squarely in some of these categories and Respondent fails to ascribe
ordinary meaning to those categories that would exclude them from the BITs’ scope.!7°
Greece cannot get around the fact that it explicitly agreed to include financial

instruments in both BITs.!””

133. In addition, Claimants argue that Greece’s attempt to import definitions from Romak v.

Uzbekistan and Alps Finance v. Slovakia is inapposite.!”*

134. In any case, Claimants assert that the GGB interests purchased on the secondary market
constitute protected “investments.” The distinction drawn by Respondent between
GGBs and interests in GGBs and the fact that PoStova banka was not a registered
Participant in the System make no difference for jurisdictional purposes.'” This
distinction also ignores recent decisions by tribunals in Abaclat v. Argentina and

Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina.

135. Purchases by investors like PoStova banka imply a contribution to the Hellenic
Republic because the flow of funds to Greece depends entirely on the sale of GGBs on
the secondary market. Claimants state that the issuance of GGBs was necessarily
premised on the existence of a robust secondary market and that Greece knew and
understood this and therefore required the Primary Dealers to make a market in its
bonds.'®° Claimants base this proposition on several sections of the documents

underlying issuance of the bonds.'*!

136. During the Hearing, Claimants responded to the distinction raised by Respondent

between the issuance of the bonds and their purchase in the secondary market in order

to question the existence of an economic contribution. Claimants stated that foreign
portfolio investment provides access to funds that the State did not have and that the
increased liquidity generated by secondary market GGBs facilitated Greece’s debt
financing.'*? Furthermore, Greece treated the relevant investors in GGBs as if they
were the first purchaser in the secondary market.'** In fact, as further evidence of a
unified market between the primary and secondary markets, Claimants stated that

holders in the secondary market were the ones that voted the Consent Solicitation. '**

137. In addition, Claimants hold that the tribunals in Abaclat v. Argentina and Ambiente
Ufficio v. Argentina found that there is no distinction between government bonds and
security entitlements held in a book-and-entry form in a universal depository such as
Clearstream, since they are part and parcel of the same investment operation.'*° These
tribunals also rejected attempts to separate the primary and secondary markets and
found that investors in the secondary market had provided a contribution to the State.!*°
Referring to the “unity of an investment operation” as explained by the CSOB v.
Slovakia tribunal, Claimants conclude that: “/t/he bonds and the interests in the bonds
are part of one single act of investment in which Postova Bank and Greece

participated.”'*"

138. Moreover, Claimants submit that Greece’s conduct during the time of the restructuring,
whereby it treated PoStova banka as a bondholder and included holders of Designated
Securities in the Invitation Memorandum to participate in the exchange, cannot be
squared with its current litigation position. These facts were significant for the Abaclat

v. Argentina tribunal, which concluded that a sovereign that included secondary market

purchasers in the exchange offer admitted their importance in the bond issuance and

distribution process. !**

139. For these reasons, Claimants assert that secondary market purchases of GGBs

constitute protected investments.

140. As to the territorial nexus, Claimants first signal that neither the Slovakia~-Greece BIT
nor the Cyprus-Greece BIT require the funds to be linked to a specific project in
Greece and that tribunals, such as the tribunal in Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina, have
refused to insert such a requirement into treaties.'®? For territoriality purposes, it is
sufficient that funds were put at the disposal of Greece to foster its economic

development.!*°

. In this regard, Claimants explain that the GGBs are located in the Bank of Greece!?!
and that their issuance and their sale in the secondary market constitute a single
investment in Greece.'** Territorial nexus should be assessed differently in events of
financial investments, for, as established in Fedax v. Venezuela and in CSOB v.
Slovakia, in such events the funds are not physically transferred to the territory of the
beneficiary, but put at its disposal elsewhere.!®* Hence, in this case, the relevant
question is whether PoStova banka ultimately made funds available to Greece to
support its economic development. It is clear that Claimants’ investment involved a

flow of funds into Greece and thus the territorial nexus is satisfied.!°4

142. Since the bond issuance process incorporated both the primary and secondary markets
as a means to provide Greece with funds for government spending, and since the GGBs
would not have been successfully sold on the primary market without the secondary

market, the territorial nexus is satisfied.'9> This conclusion was also reached by the

Abaclat v. Argentina and Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina tribunals.'°° The existence of a
minor time interval between the flow of funds from the bond issuance to the sale of
bonds in the secondary market and the fact that Clearstream accounts were located in
Luxembourg and governed by Luxembourg law do not bear consequences on this

territoriality nexus.!°7

143. In addition, since GGBs are “investments” within the meaning of the BITs, they qualify
as investments under Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention. According to Claimants,
the ICSID Convention does not pose a bar due to a more restrictive definition of
investment than in each BIT. Greece’s consent to ICSID jurisdiction in each BIT
creates a strong presumption that the parties considered the bonds an investment under
both treaties to be an investment under the Convention.'* Furthermore, since the
drafters of the Convention chose not to define “investment,” “the clear trend is for
tribunals to hold that assets that fall within the definition of ‘investment’ under an
ipplicable bilateral in treaty also itute an ‘in ’ under the ICSID

Convention absent compelling reasons to disregard the Parties’ mutually agreed
2199

definition.
144. Nonetheless, Claimants submit that even under the “double-barreled test,” GGBs
qualify as a protected investment within the context of a broad “objective” definition of
the term investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.”” The purchase of
sovereign debt is not a marginal economic activity that can be compared to transactions
that have been determined to fall outside of the ICSID Convention.” In this sense and
referring to the decisions in Fedax v. Venezuela, Abaclat v. Argentina and Ambiente

Ufficio v. Argentina, Claimants state that every ICSID tribunal that has considered the

issue has held that government debt instruments purchased in the secondary market

constitute an “investment” under the ICSID Convention.”

Claimants rebut Greece’s reference to the set of cumulative criteria to determine
whether an investment was made under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention — the “so-
called ‘Salini criteria.”” Neither the BITs nor the ICSID Convention contain these
criteria, and Greece derives their authority from cases that post-date these treaties and
therefore cannot reflect the intention of the States that are parties to those treaties.?°°
Claimants refer to writings by scholars and decisions of prior tribunals that have
criticized this position and viewed it as contrary to the ICSID Convention. Particularly,
Claimants signal to the decisions in Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania? where the tribunal
deemed that this approach might exclude transactions that have been internationally
recognized as protected investments, and to the decision in Abaclat v. Argentina where
the tribunal considered that imposing limitations that the parties did not create would

be contrary to the Convention’s aim of encouraging investments.”

In any event, GGBs satisfy the criteria of the Salini approach. First, PoStova banka
made a contribution of approximately €500 million to purchase bonds and Greece
made regular payments for these bonds.”°° Second, Claimants bore a risk beyond an
ordinary commercial risk, evidenced by the existence of a dispute and by the possibility
of the host State’s intervention in relation to the sovereign bonds.” The need for
“operational risk sharing” to establish the existence of an investment is not inserted in
the language of the BITs.”°* Third, Po’tova banka made a contribution to the Greek
economy because through the issuance of bonds the host country raised funds for

government spending. Claimants further explained that no distinction could be

duration period in the term specified in the contract, as established in Deutsche Bank v.
Sri Lanka,?'! and not by how long Claimants held the bonds.?!? Claimants dispute
Respondent’s assertions that PoStova banka bought the bonds with the intent of
reselling them, by stating that a party’s intent is irrelevant in regards to the duration
requirement. In any case, PoStova banka did not speculate in GGBs, for by holding
them in its HTM portfolio, its long-term commitment to the bonds is evidenced.
Moreover, the 2011 tradings do not undermine the status of GGBs as investments,
since resale of bonds does not negate the benefit Greece received from the credit,
regardless of who the investor was at a given point in time.?!? Claimants’ investments
remained despite the 2011 tradings and they would remain until maturity.7!* These
transactions were motivated by an effort to address the bank’s losses due to the
declining value of GGBs.7!5

of GGBs was a short-term strategy and a bet on the volatility of bonds.?!® Postova

holding them until maturity, but simply gives the bank more flexibility.2'® Once

Istrokapital Has a Protected Investment

149. Claimants argue that Istrokapital’s indirect investment in the Greek Bonds is no barrier

to its claim.

150. Istrokapital claims that, as a shareholder in PoStova banka, it made an indirect

222

investment in the assets of PoStova banka*** — the GGBs — and that such investment is

protected under Article 1(1)(c) of the Cyprus-Greece BIT.”

More precisely, Claimants
hold that “Jstrokapital indirectly invested in the Greek Bonds through its Slovak
subsidiary Postova Bank.” According to Claimants, such investment schemes have
been recognized by arbitral tribunals which have “consistently assumed jurisdiction
over claims regarding shareholders’ indirect investments through intermediary

companies in third-party States.”?°>

Claimants argue that shareholders may assert treaty claims independently of the

corporations in which they hold shares, even if there are intermediary companies
separating the shareholder claimants from their investment in the respondent State.??°
Moreover, Claimants state that such intermediary companies may be incorporated in a

State different from the Contracting States parties to the BIT in question.?””

indirect investment in shares and an indirect investment in assets and argue that what

matters is that the BIT’s definition encompasses indirect economic interests as the
Cyprus-Greece BIT does.””* According to Claimants, the tribunals in BG Group v.
Argentina and El Paso v. Argentina, among others, recognized that the claimant’s
shareholding in the local company entitled it to bring claims before the tribunal based
on the host State’s treatment of such company’s contracts and assets.””? Thus, there is
no reason why Istrokapital should be denied protection under the Cyprus-Greece BIT

of its “indirect investment in the Greek Bonds.””°

The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction Ratione Temporis and/or the Claims Should Be
Dismissed on the Grounds of Abuse of Process

a. Respondent’s Position

. Respondent claims that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis over claims
based on the GGB interests held in PoStova banka’s HTM portfolio because Claimants
did not possess a protected investment at the time when the measures that allegedly
violated the relevant BITs were taken.*! According to Respondent, Po8tova banka had
transferred all risk associated with these interests and only assumed the losses claimed
in the present arbitration ex post facto? Such post hoc assumption of losses also
constitutes an abuse of process as it was made with the view of claiming them in this

arbitration.?*3

Respondent argues that in order to establish jurisdiction ratione temporis, a claimant
must show that it held a protected investment under the ICSID Convention and the
relevant BIT at the time when the alleged treaty violation occurred.” In this vein,
Respondent maintains that risk is an inherent element of a protected investment under

both the ICSID Convention and the two relevant BITs and, citing to KT Asia v.

Kazakhstan, contends that such element is missing when a claimant is somehow

shielded from any risk.?*>

According to Respondent, PoStova banka entered into a series of agreements with J&T
Finance in response to the pressure from its regulator (the NBS) to limit its exposure to
GGBs in order to protect capital adequacy.”*° Respondent argues that this purpose was
achieved through the Assignment Agreements, which fully shielded PoStova banka
from any risk associated with the GGB interests in its HTM portfolio, including that of
debt exchange.”*’ Thus, as of December 23, 2011, PoStova banka’s investment in the
GGB interests held in its HTM portfolio lost the element of risk inherent to the

definition of a protected investment.?**

Under the Assignment Agreements, PoStova banka was protected from any losses on
the GGBs so that it would not have been entitled to claim any damages in arbitration.??
Respondent asserts that PoStova banka only assumed the losses purportedly derived
from the Bondholder Act, the Consent Solicitation and the implementation of the debt
exchange after they had occurred. Indeed, Respondent claims that although
backdated to March 8, 2012, the Settlement Agreement that intended to cancel the
Assignment Agreements only became effective on March 13, 2012, i.e., after the
aforementioned measures had come into effect.”*! In this regard, Respondent explains
that a notification from Clearstream informing that the new securities had been credited
to PoStova banka’s account was set in the Settlement Agreement as a condition for the
cancellation of the Assignment Agreements and such notification was made on March

13, 2012.2

According to Respondent, the fact that the Settlement Agreement was conveniently

backdated to exactly the day before the results of the Consent Solicitation were

announced and four days before the debt exchange was implemented,
by the fact that Claimants were still exchanging drafts of the Settlkement Agreement in
late March 2012 and accordingly did not disclose the existence of that agreement in the
annual reports filed in the first semester of 2012.74 Respondent also suggests that the
minutes provided by Claimants as evidence that a settlement agreement was discussed
and approved on March 8, 2012 are not only unreliable but actually refer to another

agreement.”

158. In this regard, Respondent also claims that Claimants’ theory that an original settlement
agreement was effectively signed on March 8, 2012 and later amended is untenable as
Claimants have failed to produce the signed “original” agreement and to provide a
witness statement from the purported signatory (Mr. Hoffmann).7*° Since Claimants
have failed to deliver a consistent explanation of why the Settlement Agreement was
backdated to March 8, 2012, it must be inferred that PoStové banka assumed the losses
related to its HTM portfolio ex post facto with the sole purpose of claiming

compensation for the face value of the securities in this arbitration.”

159. In response to Claimants’ contention that the Assignment Agreements never entered
into effect because the condition precedent of a “haircut” never occurred, Respondent
notes that such assertion is inconsistent with the information provided by Postova
banka in its annual reports, the representations it made to its auditor and to its regulator
and with internal documents that suggest that PoStova banka would receive payment
from J&T Finance even in the event of a compulsory debt exchange.*4* Moreover,
Respondent points out that the text of the Assignment Agreements itself contemplated

a debt exchange.” Also, Respondent argues that the correct interpretation of the

Assignment Agreements is that they were effective on signature, but J&T Finance was

not obliged to make payments until the Due Date or the Early Due Date.?”

Finally, and in response to Claimants’ argument that Article 10(3) of the Slovakia-
Greece BIT explicitly acknowledges that a claimant may shield itself from risk without
losing protection under the BIT, Respondent argues that such provision refers to
insurance contracts which are different from the transactions under discussion.
According to Respondent, the J&T Finance Assignment Agreements are best paralleled
to a forward sale of receivables that effectively transfers the entire risk and not to an

insurance contract where payment of a premium is required.>!

In sum, Respondent claims that since PoStova banka was shielded from the risk
associated with its HTM portfolio at the time when the disputed measures were taken
and only assumed the losses ex post facto, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione

temporis over claims based on such interests.?>*

Furthermore, Respondent argues that, in any event, PoStova banka’s decision to assume
the losses ex post facto constitutes an abuse of process, because it was made in view of
the upcoming dispute and with the intention of claiming such losses in international
arbitration.2*? According to Respondent, the foregoing is particularly evidenced in
correspondence from PoStova banka and Istrokapital to international law firms
“regarding proposal for legal representation in dispute with Greece” dated February
23, 2012.74 It is also evidenced by a memorandum sent by the General Manager of
J&T Finance to Mario Hoffman and PoStova banka’s CEO, among others, which, in
exploring PoStova banka’s alternatives regarding the Consent Solicitation, suggested

that the best option was “not to ‘swap’” because it opened the door for international

arbitration against Greece.”°°

In its Reply, Respondent contests the alleged contradictions adverted by Claimants in
regard to its understanding of the transactions involving the Assignment Agreements
and the backdated Settlement Agreement. First, Respondent explains that these
transactions were motivated by the positions adopted by the NBS and PoStova banka’s
auditor KMPG regarding the bank’s dealing with its exposure to Greek debt.?*° Second,
Respondent asserts that J&T Finance is not part of the Istrokapital group and the
question of whether it could have brought a claim against Greece itself is irrelevant for
the purposes of this arbitration.?°’ Lastly, Respondent argues that Claimants can hardly
complain that Respondent disregarded the agreements between J&T Finance and
Istrokapital, when Claimants themselves concealed those agreements from PoStova
banka’s auditor and regulator.*** Besides, Respondent claims that, in any event,
evidence in the record supports the conclusion that J&T Finance was the one bearing

the risk of losses pursuant to the Assignment Agreements.?°°

As for the GGB interests held in PoStova banka’s AFS portfolio, Respondent claims
that these were purchased in late 2011 with a view to initiating investment treaty
arbitration at a time when the present dispute was highly probable and, as a result,
claims based on such GGBs should also be dismissed on grounds of abuse of

process.76°

In this regard, Respondent recalls that in the course of 2011, Po8tova banka sold the
GGB interests in its AFS portfolio and then repurchased the same amount and same
series in December 2011.76! According to Respondent, by this time the present dispute
was “clearly foreseeable” as the upcoming debt exchange had already been announced

in the October 26, 2011 Euro Summit.2° Additionally, consultations between Greece,

Euro Area authorities and private creditors on the debt exchange had been amply

publicized since July 2011.7

Moreover, Respondent explains that while PoStova banka’s selling of the GGB
interests in its AFS portfolio could achieve the stated purpose of improving the bank’s
capital adequacy and also result in some tax benefits, the same rationale cannot be
applied to the repurchase of the same interests as no such benefits would derive
therefrom. Hence, Respondent concludes that the repurchase of the GGB interests in
late 2011 can only be explained as an attempt to buy claims against Greece in view of

an imminent dispute.”

Finally, Respondent asserts that the transactions carried out by PoStova banka in
connection with the GGB interests held in its HTM portfolio and those held in its AFS
portfolio are not inconsistent.2% On the contrary, they are easily explained as
Claimants’ attempt to “double down on its bet” by buying further interests at a great
discount with a view of bringing a claim against Greece for the full face value of such

instruments.?*”

Accordingly, Respondent requests that all claims based on the GGB interests held in
Postova banka’s AFS portfolio be dismissed on grounds of abuse of process, as these
were bought at a time when the present dispute was clearly foreseeable and with the

sole intention of claiming compensation for their face value in this arbitration.?°*

b. Claimants’ Position

According to Claimants, Respondent’s ratione temporis and abuse of process
objections fail on both legal and factual grounds. As regards the legal justification,
Claimants argue that Respondent’s risk theory is an “improper distortion” of the Salini

test, irrelevant for the purposes of a ratione temporis objection. As to the factual

grounds, Claimants assert that Respondent has failed to fully and correctly explain the

context and effects of the Assignment Agreements and related transactions.”°?

170. First, Claimants argue that Respondent’s “unprecedented” theory that PoStova banka
did not hold a protected investment at the time when the treaty breaches occurred
because it was allegedly shielded from risk is not a question of jurisdiction ratione
temporis.2” According to Claimants, the ratione temporis doctrine “is entirely about
timing of investments and nationality at the time the investment was made and the time
that the treaty claim arose.”*"! Since Respondent has not made any allegations that

touch upon these questions, the ratione temporis doctrine is simply inapplicable.?””

Second, Claimants assert that Respondent’s reliance on the Salini test is misplaced
because the proper standard for determining whether a given investment is protected is
found in the language of the BIT. According to Claimants, the bonds in question are
comprised within the definition of investment of the Slovakia~-Greece BIT and such

status did not change upon Claimants’ entrance into the Assignment Agreements.””?

172. Third, Claimants argue that even if the Salini test were applied, Respondent’s
contentions are unsupported by case-law. On the one hand, tribunals that have applied
the Salini test have found that the fact that a claimant has mitigated the risk of its
investment does not necessarily mean that such investment is no longer protected.” In
this regard, the decision in KT Asia v. Kazakhstan relied upon by Respondent is
inapposite as it does not address a case where an investor made an investment and then

275

mitigated against part of its risk.“'” Moreover, Claimants indicate that the two relevant

BITs allow investors to mitigate against the risk of their investment through insurance

or otherwise?”° and accordingly prohibit raising a defense to the effect that an investor

has received compensation for damages under an insurance contract.?”7

173. On the other hand, even the tribunals that apply the Salini test convey that the elements
of an investment must be globally assessed and that the fact that one of them is not
present does not necessarily imply a lack of jurisdiction.?”* Thus, Respondent’s theory
that a temporary disappearance of one Salini factor renders an otherwise protected

investment no longer protected, is also unsupported.?””

174. In addition to the legal flaws in Respondent’s allegations, Claimants argue that
Respondent’s ratione temporis argument according to which Postova banka was
shielded from risk through the Assignment Agreements is not supported by the facts on

the record.

175. First, Claimants explain that under the J&T Finance agreements, Istrokapital — and not
J&T Finance — would absorb the losses eventually suffered by PoStova banka in
connection with the GGBs.”*° Claimants insist that these transactions must be
examined in conjunction with the share purchase agreement between Istrokapital and
J&T Finance whereby Istrokapital endeavored to reimburse J&T Finance for any losses
resulting from the bond restructuring.**' Accordingly, if a “haircut” was imposed on
the GGBs and, as a result, the Assignment Agreements came into effect, J&T Finance
would — pursuant to another set of assignment agreements between Istrokapital and
J&T Finance — assign to Istrokapital the claims previously assigned by Postova banka
under the Assignment Agreements.”*? In any event, Claimants point out that regardless

of who bore the losses, the risk factor remained inherent to the investment.?8?

Claimants complain that Respondent has conveniently overlooked the agreements
between J&T Finance and Istrokapital, hiding behind the fact that these were allegedly
concealed from KPMG and the NBS. In response to this allegation, Claimants explain
that those authorities have no jurisdiction over Istrokapital and thus Claimants were
only obliged to disclose what was reflected in the agreements between J&T Finance

and Postova banka.?*+

Second, Claimants argue that, in any event, the Assignment Agreements were
cancelled on March 8, 2012 by means of the Settlement Agreement. According to
Claimants, the cancellation of the Assignment Agreements was a result of the need for
an alternative structure to protect J&T Finance from losses associated with the GGBs in
view of the fact that a “seizure of the Greek Bonds” rather than a “haircut” was going

to take place.”*>

Third, even if the Settlement Agreement only entered into force on March 13, 2012, as
Respondent claims, PoStova banka had not assigned the “bonds” at the time of the
alleged treaty breaches because the condition precedent for the assignment envisaged in

the Assignment Agreements, namely a “haircut,” had not taken place at that time.?°°

As regards the abuse of process allegations, Claimants note that Respondent has failed
to comply with the high burden of proof that falls on the party raising such a claim.?°”
According to Claimants, none of the facts and evidence presented by Respondent
support the abuse of process claims.?** First, Claimants argue that Respondent’s theory
in regard to the cancellation of the Assignment Agreements as a means for PoStova
banka to assume the losses ex post facto and thereby gain standing in this arbitration is
illogical.”*° In this regard, Claimants point out that under Respondent’s theory, there
would be no reason for Postova banka to struggle with the cancellation of the

Assignment Agreements in order to get jurisdiction, because the Czech J&T Finance,

as alleged “true” holder of the Bonds, could have brought the claim itself under an

identical BIT.?°

Second, Claimants assert that the standard of review of an abuse of process claim is
whether a claimant took actions to manufacture jurisdiction where there was none.??!
According to Claimants, Respondent’s theory is flawed as its fails to explain why
PoStova banka decided to enter into the Assignment Agreements, which supposedly
endangered the claim, precisely at the time where a possible lawsuit was foreseeable,
but then hurriedly cancelled those agreements to obtain the same jurisdiction it would
have had three months before, when the Assignment Agreements had not been signed,

and then waited six months to exercise jurisdiction by initiating this arbitration.”””

As regards the allegedly backdated Settlement Agreement, Claimants argue that
Respondent did not meet the burden of proof of an abuse of process claim as it failed to
demonstrate that Claimants acted in bad faith.2?* Claimants explain that an original
settlement agreement was effectively signed on March 8, 2012, but since it had to be
drafted quickly in light of the pace of the events, the parties then negotiated a more
detailed Settlement Agreement replacing the original version. Given that the Settlement
Agreement provided the exact same protections as the original one, the parties found it
appropriate to date the former as of the same date as the latter.°* Claimants stress that

this explanation is consistent with Mr. Tarda’s testimony.?°

Moreover, Claimants
contradict Respondent’s contention that the Settlement Agreement did not exist until
late March 2012 by pointing out that it was discussed and approved in extraordinary
meetings of PoStova banka held on March 7 and 8, 2012, as evidenced in the

corresponding minutes.?°°

182. Finally, Claimants assert that the evidence invoked by Respondent as proof of PoStova
banka’s intention of manufacturing jurisdiction is clearly insufficient.?°’ According to
Claimants, bad faith cannot be derived from the fact that Claimants sought legal advice
in a situation (passing of the Bondholder Act) where legal representation was obviously
needed.”** As regards the memorandum discussing alternatives to respond to the
Consent Solicitation, Claimants point out that the document simply offers different
scenarios, including that of international arbitration, but says nothing about an effort to
manufacture jurisdiction.”°

183. On the contrary, Claimants argue that Respondent conveniently ignored the
presentations made by officials of PoStova banka in connection with the decision to
accept or reject the Exchange Offer. According to Claimants, these documents show
that PoStova banka’s main concern in this regard was whether the new securities would
be transferable to third parties in case liquidity was needed, but do not support
Respondent’s contention that PoStova banka reassumed the losses in order to gain

standing to later claim those losses in international arbitration.>”

184. Further, Claimants claim that the structure of the transactions envisaged in the
Settlement Agreement show that Claimants’ underlying intention was to ensure that
Postova banka stayed capitalized if the bonds were “forcibly taken” and that J&T

Finance would persist in its investment in PoStova banka without assuming the losses

derived from the bonds.*”!

185. Also, Claimants explain that the Assignment Agreements were cancelled in view of the

fact that the debt restructuring would consist of a swap instead of a “haircut” as

302

envisaged by the Assignment Agreements.*”* Contrary to Respondent’s contentions,

the Assignment Agreements could not possibly apply to a bond swap because they

were premised on transactions to be carried out with the existing bonds. If these ceased

to exist as the result of a bond exchange, the structure would no longer work.?°?

186. As regards the abuse of process claim in connection with the GGBs held in Po8tova
banka’s AFS portfolio, Claimants point to the contradictions in Respondent’s theory
that such bonds were sold and repurchased in late 2011 in an effort to create

jurisdiction in view of an upcoming dispute.

187. First, Claimants point out that if PoStova banka’s intention was to acquire claims, it
would make no sense that it would sell the bonds it already held.*°> According to
Claimants, PoStova banka was entitled to invoke the Tribunal’s jurisdiction both before
and after those trades were made and it simply bought back the same bonds at a loss in
order to ensure the bank’s capital adequacy.*” Moreover, Claimants argue that the
repurchase of the bonds only evidences the bank’s intention to hold the bonds to
maturity.*°’ Claimants add that there is no difference in the investment before and after
the sale and repurchase transactions, but even if treated as separate investments, there is

no basis to decline jurisdiction.*°

188. Second, Claimants assert that it is contradictory to argue that PoStova banka was at the
same time trying to shield itself from risk in relation to the GGBs held in its HTM
portfolio, while trying to purchase new bonds and gain risk to access international

arbitration in respect to the AFS portfolio.*

189. Accordingly, Claimants conclude that contrary to Respondent’s “imagined theories,”

which are not supported by the record, the only consistent and logical explanation is

that Claimants’ actions “had nothing to do with future treaty claims against Greece and

3. The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction Ratione Personae Over Istrokapital

a. Respondent’s Position

190. Respondent claims that Istrokapital is neither a “national of another Contracting State”
for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, nor a legal person organized
under Cypriot law with its seat in Cyprus as required by Article 1(3)(b) of the Cyprus-
Greece BIT.*!! Hence, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae over

Istrokapital.

191. Respondent argues that in order to qualify as an investor under Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention, a claimant must meet a twofold requirement: it must be a national
of a Contracting State of the ICSID Convention and it must not have the nationality of
the respondent State.*!? According to Respondent, as a supranational company
established under EU law, Istrokapital is incapable of fulfilling this twofold

condition.33

192. First, Respondent argues that as a societas europeas (“SE”), Istrokapital is formed and
existing under the law of the EU and not under Cypriot law.*'* In view of the fact that
the EU is not a Contracting State of the ICSID Convention, Istrokapital does not

qualify as an investor under Article 25(1) of the Convention.*'>

193. According to Respondent, Recital 6 and Article 1(1) of SE Regulation confirm that a
SE derives its existence and legal personality from EU law. Respondent claims that

Claimants have mischaracterized SE Regulation, in particular its Articles 3 and 10, as

59

none of these provisions obliges Greece to treat Istrokapital as a Cypriot investor for

the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.?!°

194. Second, Respondent contends that if, due to its SE nature, Istrokapital were considered
to have been incorporated in Cyprus, as Claimants claim, it had to be equally
considered as incorporated in any of the other EU Member States, including Greece,
and would therefore bear Greek nationality as well.*!’ Since Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention implicitly precludes juridical persons who have the “nationality” of the
respondent State from resorting to ICSID arbitration,*!* Istrokapital is outside the

Centre’s jurisdiction.*!”

195. In this regard, Respondent claims that Claimants’ analogy between an SE and an EU
citizen fails to disprove Respondent’s contention that Istrokapital does not comply with
the diversity of nationality requirement. According to Respondent, the status of an SE
is neither accessory nor complementary as is the EU citizenship and the proposed

analogy is therefore inapposite.*?°

196. Further, Respondent asserts that Istrokapital is not a protected investor under the
Cyprus-Greece BIT as it does not comply with the two cumulative conditions required
by Article 1(3)(b) of that BIT, namely those of (i) being constituted under Cypriot law
and (ii) having its seat (“édpa”) within Cypriot territory.*?! In other words, Istrokapital
lacks a genuine connection with Cyprus, which is required by the relevant BIT in the
form of incorporation and seat.*??

197. First, Respondent insists that Istrokapital is constituted under EU law and not under

Cypriot law.*”? Second, Respondent claims that since the SE nature allows Istrokapital

to transfer its seat from one EU Member State to another without dissolution or

reincorporation, Istrokapital lacks a genuine connection with Cyprus.*?+

198. Respondent asserts that Claimants’ translation of the term “édpa” as “registered office”
without requiring an “effective center of business administration” is incorrect. First, the
equation of “édpa” with “registered office” would render the two cumulative conditions
of Article 1(3)(b) of the Cyprus-Greece BIT ineffectual because the maintenance of a
registered office is practically a requirement of incorporation.*?> Second, Respondent
claims that the legal authorities invoked by Claimants as evidence that “édpa’” means
“registered office” actually support Respondent’s contention that the term’s correct

translation is “seat.”

199. Moreover, Respondent claims that Istrokapital cannot be deemed to have its seat within
Cypriot territory as required by Article 1(3)(b) of the Cyprus-Greece BIT, because the

company is not effectively managed from Cyprus.”

200. According to Respondent, the foregoing is evidenced by the fact that all of
Istrokapital’s current employees and directors are Slovak nationals who reside in the
Slovak Republic; the costs associated with Istrokapital’s registered office from 2010
to 2013 are primarily related to travel, supposed corporate events and telephone and

329 and

post expenses and the office itself does not seem to be used by the company;
most of the company’s operating expenses between 2010 and 2012 were incurred for
activities outside of Cyprus.**? According to Respondent, Claimants’ contention to the

contrary is incorrect or at least misleading.**!

Respondent contends that it is unlikely that a conglomerate the size of Istrokapital

could be effectively managed by only two non-resident employees and directors who

only meet four times a year for short periods of time outside of Istrokapital’s office.***
Instead, the more plausible inference from these facts is that Istrokapital is effectively
managed in the Slovak Republic where its ultimate beneficial owner (the Slovak Mr.

Hoffmann) resides.***

202. In sum, Respondent claims that Istrokapital lacks the genuine connection requirement
derived from the conjunctive conditions of incorporation and seat established under the
Cyprus-Greece BIT and therefore cannot be considered a protected investor under the

said treaty.>*4

203. Finally, Respondent argues that Istrokapital may not resort to investment treaty
arbitration by means of an intra-EU BIT in order to resolve a dispute that involves key
issues of EU law and touches upon the involvement of the EU and its Member States in

the Greek financial crisis.**

204. According to Respondent, by allowing that cases involving matters of EU law — such as
the present dispute — may be resolved by an investor-State arbitration tribunal, Article 9
of the Cyprus-Greece BIT disproves the CJEU’s role as final and sole authoritative
interpreter of EU law and is therefore incompatible with EU law.?*° Respondent claims
that under both Article 30(3) of the VCLT and EU law, EU law prevails over
conflicting provisions of intra-EU BITs that were entered into before the States parties
to the relevant BIT acceded to the European Union.**” Accordingly, Respondent
concludes that Istrokapital may not rely on the Cyprus-Greece BIT in order to have the
present dispute resolved by this Tribunal.*** In its Reply, Respondent stresses that
Claimants failed to address the incompatibility of the present arbitration with EU

law 339

b. Claimants’ Position

205. Contrary to Respondent’s contentions, Claimants assert that Istrokapital is indeed a
protected investor under both Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(3)(b)
of the Cyprus-Greece BIT.**?

206. Claimants argue that the nationality of a juridical person under Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention is determined by its place of incorporation or registered office.*#!
Istrokapital’s constitutive documents evidence that Istrokapital was incorporated in
Cyprus under Cypriot law, with its registered office in Cyprus, and Respondent’s
arguments to the effect that Istrokapital may not be deemed a “national of another
Contracting State” under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention mischaracterize and

disregard applicable EU law.*¥

207. Claimants assert that pursuant to the European Company Regulation, SEs must be
treated as public limited-liability companies of the Member State in which they have
their registered office.*#* Similarly, other provisions of the same Regulation evidence
that SEs are subject in many key aspects to the national law of the country in which

they have their registered office.*#

208. Moreover, Claimants sustain that, per the European Company Regulation, SEs are
domiciled in one single State and the fact that they can transfer their registered office
within the EU does not mean that they have multiple nationalities or no nationality
because such transfer is subject to registration in a Member State at a time.*>
Claimants also compare an SE with a natural person holding the nationality of an EU

Member State who automatically becomes an EU citizen, but is not therefore rendered

a national of every or no Member State.*4°

209. Claimants further argue that Istrokapital is a protected investor under the Cyprus-
Greece BIT. First, Claimants claim that the Cyprus-Greece BIT does not require that
Istrokapital have its “effective center of administration” in Cyprus.*4’ Following the
principles of treaty interpretation found in the VCLT, Claimants argue that (i) the
ordinary meaning of the word “édpa” in the context of corporate nationality has the
same interchangeable meaning whether translated as “seat” or as “registered office,”**

(ii) there is no reason for interpreting this term restrictively because the BIT does not

direct the interpreter to do so;*“ and (iii) the use of “édpa” in other of Greece’s BITs

confirms that the term is not intended to impose additional requirements on investors

other than having a “registered office” in the home State.*°°

210. In any event, Claimants assert that Istrokapital meets the standard for its “effective
center of administration” to be located in Cyprus, as (i) all of its board meetings and
shareholders’ meetings are held in Cyprus;*>! (ii) contrary to Respondent’s contention
its two managing directors reside, work and pay income taxes in Cyprus;*>? the
company is registered in Cyprus for tax purposes and pays value-added tax there;**
(iii) most of Istrokapital’s operating expenses (audit services; taxes and local fees; rent
and utilities for its office; employees’ salaries, among others) relate to its operations in
Cyprus;*** and (iv) Istrokapital has its head office in the same place as its registered
office in compliance with applicable EU law.** Accordingly, even under the expansive
interpretation of Article 1(3)(b) of the Cyprus-Greece BIT proposed by Respondent,

Istrokapital is a Cypriot investor.?°°

211. Claimants refute the theory that intra-EU BITs have become invalid or have otherwise
terminated as a result of the States’ accession to the EU.**” Claimants point out that, as
recognized by various arbitral tribunals, intra-EU BITs remain valid because they have
not been terminated pursuant to their own terms or the VCLT.*** Specifically, neither
of the States parties to the Cyprus-Greece and the Slovakia-Greece BITs have provided

notice of termination of either treaty pursuant to the respective BIT’s terms.*?

212. Moreover, Article 59 of the VCLT, which is often invoked as basis of the proposition
that intra-EU BITs are no longer valid, does not apply to the Slovakia-Greece and
Cyprus-Greece BITs because (i) EU treaties and the two relevant BITs do not relate to
the same subject matter;*° (ii) neither of the States parties to the Slovakia-Greece and
Cyprus-Greece BITs have indicated that they intended for their BITs to be superseded
by Slovakia’s or Cyprus’ accessions to the EU;*°! and (iii) EU treaties and the two

362

relevant BITs are not in such conflict that they cannot apply simultaneously.°°* In any

event, Article 59 of the VCLT is inapplicable because neither Greece nor Slovakia or
Cyprus have initiated the notification procedure required by the VCLT in order to
invoke termination of the respective BITs.°° In conclusion, Claimants assert that both
the Slovakia-Greece and the Cyprus-Greece BITs remain in full force and effect and
Claimants are entitled to rely on them in order to submit their investment disputes

against Greece to international arbitration.**

4, The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction Over Claimants’ Umbrella Clause Claims and/or
Claimants Have Failed to Establish Prima Facie Such Claims

a. Respondent’s Position

213. Relying on the 2013 Resolution of the Institute of International Law, Respondent
argues that umbrella clauses cannot be imported, as Claimants claim.*® In this regard,
Respondent first argues that the MFN clauses in the Slovakia-Greece and Cyprus-
Greece BITs do not apply to umbrella clauses because the said treaties do not contain
an umbrella clause themselves.* Moreover, the extension of the protection of the
Slovakia-Greece and Cyprus-Greece BITs to obligations incurred by Greece under its

domestic law would violate the ejusdem generis rule.*”

214. Second, Respondent claims that the umbrella clauses, in general, and the ones that
Claimants seek to invoke, in particular, require contractual privity.*** Respondent
argues that since neither PoStova banka nor Istrokapital has entered into any contractual

relationship with Greece, they may not invoke any umbrella clauses.*”

215. More specifically, Respondent argues that the umbrella clauses invoked by Claimants
only apply to “obligations entered into by the host State under investment contracts
and may only be invoked by the party to whom the contractual obligation is owed
under applicable domestic law.”>”° Respondent argues that the only contracts entered
into by PoStova banka in connection with the GGBs are ordinary commercial
agreements to which Greece is not a party.*”' Thus, Claimants have failed to
demonstrate that Greece has entered into an obligation with regard to their purported

investment for purposes of the invoked umbrella clauses.*””

66

216. Third, Respondent argues that even accepting Claimants’ proposed standard, Claimants
have failed to establish that (i) there is an “obligor-obligee relationship” between
Claimants and Greece that (ii) gives rise to obligations “specific in relation to an
investment.”?’? Regarding the first requirement, Respondent claims that the parties’
obligations arising from the GGBs must be examined under Greek law.*”* In this
regard, Respondent first notes that since Claimants do not qualify as bondholders under
the terms of the GGBs, they cannot invoke any rights under the GGBs’ terms or under
the offering circulars.*”* Second, Respondent argues that under Law 2198/1994,
PoStova banka only has a claim to payment against Greece if the latter fails to pay “due
interest and principal” to the Bank of Greece, which never occurred in the instant
case.*’° Otherwise, Po&tova banka only has a claim to payment against Clearstream.*””
Therefore, Respondent concludes that Law 2198/1994 does not create an obligor-
obligee relationship between Greece and Po8tova banka.*”* Finally, Respondent asserts
that Claimants have failed to demonstrate that the GGBs terms and conditions
conferred on them a right to payment that could not be lawfully amended under the

applicable Greek law.*””

217. Fourth, Respondent asserts that, by voting the Consent Solicitation, PoStova banka (i)
waived any rights it may have had under Greek law in connection with GGBs and (ii)
agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of Greek courts any dispute arising under the
Consent Solicitation and the Exchange Offer.**° Accordingly, Claimants may not raise

umbrella clause claims asserting that Greece violated its obligations under the

aforementioned documents.**!

b. Claimants’ Position

218. Claimants argue that by virtue of the MEN clauses contained in the Slovakia-Greece
and Cyprus-Greece BITs, they are entitled to import the umbrella clauses found in
other treaties entered into by Greece and, specifically, those found in the Jordan-Greece

and Croatia-Greece BITs.**”

219. According to Claimants, the authorities cited by Respondent to argue that investors
cannot rely on the clauses to import umbrella clauses actually undermine this

position.

220. Claimants argue that Respondent’s position that umbrella clause claims require
contractual privity ignores the absence of any such limitation in the relevant BITs***
and has little support in decisions of other investor-State tribunals.**° Moreover, the
idea that umbrella clause claims cannot be based on general commitments made by

States is also undermined in previous decisions of other tribunals.°*°

221. Claimants submit that the umbrella clause refers to the existence of an obligor-obligee
relationship between the host State and claimant in relation to an investment.**”
Accordingly, Claimants argue that the question for determining whether the umbrella
clause applies is whether the host State has assumed international obligations with
respect to the claimant and its investment.**8

222. According to Claimants, such an obligor-obligee relationship clearly exists between
Respondent and Claimants “with respect to payments of interest and principal”

deriving from the terms of the GGBs.**? Also, in Law 2198/1994, Greece recognizes

that payment obligations are specifically owed to investors.**” Therefore, Claimants

insist that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over its umbrella clause claims.*?!

223. Moreover, Claimants assert that the fact that the Invitation Memorandum was also
directed to holders who had bought bonds in the secondary market without regard to
when and how their purchases were made, and, as a result, that holders in the
secondary market voted and fully participated in the process, shows that there was an
obligation on the part of Greece and a sufficient relationship between Greece and the

secondary purchasers to create an umbrella-clause claim.*”

224. Finally, Claimants argue that the validity and meaning of the waiver contained in the
Invitation Memorandum is a question to be discussed in the merits phase, if

necessary.?°?

VI. ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBUNAL

225. Respondent has submitted objections to the jurisdiction ratione materiae, ratione
personae and ratione temporis of the Tribunal — together with an allegation of abuse of

process — and an objection to jurisdiction related to the umbrella clause.

226. The objections to jurisdiction ratione materiae are twofold: First, Respondent claims
that Istrokapital never made an investment under the Cyprus-Greece BIT and that
Istrokapital may not base jurisdiction on assets of PoStova banka. Second, Respondent
considers that PoStova banka’s GGB interests are not protected investments under the

Slovakia-Greece and Cyprus-Greece BITs.

227. For purposes of its analysis, the Tribunal will initially address objections to jurisdiction

ratione materiae as follows:

a. By determining whether Istrokapital may establish jurisdiction on the
basis that its investment under the Cyprus-Greece BIT are the GGBs held

by PoStova banka.

b. If so, by analyzing the term “investment” as described in Article 1 of the
Cyprus -Greece BIT and determining whether the GGBs and any rights of

Istrokapital thereunder fall within the scope of such definition.

c. If so, the Tribunal may have to determine whether the term “investment”
under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention has an inherent meaning or a
meaning under international law that has to be analyzed together with the
definition of “investment” under Article 1 of the Cyprus—Greece BIT, as
claimed by Respondent, or whether the term “investment” for purposes of
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention must be given the meaning of Article

1 of the Cyprus—Greece BIT, as claimed by Claimants.
Second, as to claimant Postova banka:

d. By analyzing the term “investment” as described in Article 1 of the
Slovakia-Greece BIT and establishing whether the GGBs and the rights of

PoStova banka thereunder fall within the scope of such definition.

e. If so, the Tribunal may have to determine whether the term “investment”
under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention has an inherent meaning or a
meaning under international law that has to be analyzed together with the
definition of “investment” under Article 1 of the Slovakia—Greece BIT, as
claimed by Respondent, or whether the term “investment” for purposes of
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention must be given the meaning of Article

1 of the Slovakia—Greece BIT, as claimed by Claimants.

70

1. Analysis of the Objections to the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction Ratione Materiae

a. Whether Istrokapital Has an Investment Protected Under the Cyprus-Greece
BIT

228. Istrokapital claims that, as a shareholder in PoStova banka, it made an indirect
investment in the GGBs through PoStova banka and that such investment is protected
under article 1.1. (c) the Cyprus-Greece BIT as assets comprising monetary claims and
contractual claims with an economic value*. In this regard, Istrokapital has clearly
stated that its claim rests solely on the GGB interests held by PoStova banka — that is,

on the bank’s assets — and not on its shareholding in the company.*” Respondent
challenges this position by asserting that Istrokapital has no legal right to the assets of
PoStova banka, including the GGB interests. Hence, those interests are not protected

under the Cyprus-Greece BIT and Istrokapital may not pursue a claim on such basis.*”°

229. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent: there is nothing in the record that supports
Claimants’ contention that a shareholder in the position of Istrokapital has standing to
assert claims for an alleged impairment of the assets of a company (in the place of
Postova banka) in which it holds shares. Claimants have failed to establish that the
Cyprus-Greece BIT enables Istrokapital to submit claims for any alleged rights or
claims that PoStova banka might have against Greece. Moreover, prior case law,
discussed by the Parties, supports the opposite proposition, that is, that shareholders do
not have claims arising from or rights in the assets of the companies in which they hold

shares.

230. First, as the HICEE B.V. v. Slovak Republic*”” tribunal rightly points out, the “default
position” in international law is that a company is legally distinct from its

shareholders.*** The foregoing implies that as an independent legal entity, a company is

231.

granted rights over its own assets, which it alone is capable of protecting.*°? Claimants
have not even attempted to establish whether there is a deviation of the “default
position” in the applicable domestic law. In other words, Claimants have failed to
prove that, under the applicable law, Istrokapital has any legal or contractual right to
the GGB interests held by PoStova banka that would allow it to bring a treaty claim

against Greece on the basis of an alleged impairment of such security entitlements.

Claimants’ contention does not find any support in previous decisions of investment
arbitration tribunals either. On the contrary, tribunals — such as the one in ST-AD
GmbH v. Republic of Bulgaria — have consistently held that “an investor has no
enforceable right in arbitration over the assets and contracts belonging to the company

in which it owns shares?“

232. Referring to the decisions in El Paso v. Argentina, BG v. Argentina, and ST-AD v.
Bulgaria, among others, Claimants argue that investment arbitration tribunals have
recognized that “the claimant's interest in a local company in the host State entitled it
to assert claims based in the host State’s treatment of that local company’s contracts
and assets.”*°' The foregoing is true, but — in accordance with the same decisions
referred to by Claimants — only to the extent that those claims are related to the effects
that the measures taken against the company’s assets have on the value of the

claimant’s shares in such company.

233. In El Paso v. Argentina, the question before the tribunal was whether the rights
protected by the US-Argentina BIT were limited to those pertaining to the shares held
by the claimant in various Argentinian companies, or whether they included other items
such as legal and contractual rights belonging to said companies.* In other words, the
tribunal had to examine whether certain assets of the companies in which the claimant

had a shareholding qualified as protected investments under the treaty.

234. The answer provided by the El Paso v. Argentina tribunal was straightforward: while
the shares held by the claimant in the Argentinian companies were a protected
investment under the US-Argentina BIT, the licenses and other contracts granted to the
Argentinian companies were not protected investments.‘

235. In its analysis, the E/ Paso v. Argentina tribunal first verified whether the Argentinian
companies qualified as protected investors under the relevant treaty and concluded that
they did not.* Consequently, the tribunal reasoned that if the domestic companies
were not protected investors, their assets could not be considered protected

investments.*° In the words of the tribunal:

“[...] El Paso owns no contractual rights to be protected, as it has signed no
contract with Argentina. [...] It is thus the conclusion of the Tribunal that none
of the contracts the interference with which is complained of by the Claimant
are protected investments under the ICSID Convention and the BIT.”

236. In summarizing its conclusion regarding the definition of the protected investment for

the purpose of the tribunal’s jurisdiction, the E/ Paso v. Argentina tribunal stated that

“what is protected are ‘the shares, all the shares, but only the shares. "4°"

237. The tribunal in BG v. Argentina reached the same conclusion. In that case, the claimant

contended that its investment in Argentina consisted, inter alia, of certain “rights over

22408

the economic value’ of a license for the distribution of natural gas held by one of the

domestic companies in which BG Group Plc (“BG”) owned an interest. Specifically,
BG claimed that Argentina had breached the investment treaty, causing damage to

BG’s “claims to money” and “claims to performance” under the said license.*”

238. In examining BG’s claim, the tribunal noted that BG was not a party to the license and

that it had not proved that it could directly assert any claims thereunder.*!°

Furthermore, the tribunal noted that the UK-Argentina BIT did not provide a
mechanism that would allow BG to bring claims before the tribunal derived from the
license on behalf of the domestic company.*"! Finally, the tribunal concluded that “BG
does not have standing to seize this Tribunal with ‘claims to money’ and ‘claims to

performance’, or to assert other rights, which it is not entitled to exercise directly.”*'?

239. Ultimately, the tribunal upheld jurisdiction over BG’s claims, but only in so far as they
related to its shareholding in the Argentine companies. While the tribunal found that
BG’s indirect participation in the domestic companies was an investment for the
purposes of Article 1(a)(ii) of the UK-Argentina BIT,*"? it made very clear that such
protection did not extend to the license held by one of the companies in which BG

owned an interest.

240. In Urbaser v. Argentina — another decision invoked by Claimants — the tribunal
accepted jurisdiction over the claims raised by the claimants under the relevant treaty
“for damage suffered by them arising from their investment in the form of shares in
AGBA,”*'* an Argentine company that operated a concession for the provision of public
services in Buenos Aires. In its decision, the tribunal emphatically noted that, pursuant
to claimants’ own case, their investment was bound to claimants’ shares in the
domestic company and their claims were limited to the protection of rights arising from

said shares.*! In the words of the tribunal:

“Claimants repeatedly have stated that their claim is not based on [...] a
hypothetical legal title that would allow a shareholder to raise in its own
name a claim that is based on a relationship to which the company alone is
party, and not the shareholders.”*'6

417 CMS Gas Transmi

Another decision endorsing a similar approach to the issue at hand was delivered by the
tribunal in CMS v. Argentina.*'’ This case concerned the treatment received by a
foreign investor holding a minority shareholding in an Argentine company, which, in
turn had been granted a license for the transportation of natural gas by the Argentinean
Government. The CMS v. Argentina tribunal accepted jurisdiction on the basis of the
claimant’s shareholding in the domestic company and not on the account of any rights

pertaining to such domestic company or relating to such company’s assets.*!®

The ST-AD v. Bulgaria tribunal clearly established that its jurisdiction was limited to
the claimant’s shareholding in the domestic company — which was in fact a protected
investment under the treaty — as opposed to the assets belonging to the local company

in which claimant owned shares.*!”

While the ST-AD tribunal conclusively held that “an investor whose investment consists
of shares cannot claim, for example, that the assets of the company are its property and

420 it also clarified that “such

ask for compensation for interference with these assets,
an investor can, however, claim for any loss of value of its shares resulting from an
interference with the assets or contracts of the company in which it owns the

shares.”

The same approach was confirmed by the Paushok v. Mongolia tribunal, which
recognized that a shareholder is entitled to bring claims concerning alleged treaty
breaches resulting from actions taken against the assets of the company in which it
holds shares, but only to the extent that the shareholder’s claims relate to the effect that
such actions have on the value of its shares. In the words of the Paushok v. Mongolia

tribunal:

“In the present instance, Claimants’ investment are the shares of GEM, a
company incorporated under Mongolian law as required by that country in

 

sion Company v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/O1/8, Decision of the

Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of July 17, 2003 (“CMS v. Argentina”).

order to engage into the mining business and, through ownership of those
shares, Claimants are entitled to make claims concerning alleged Treaty
breaches resulting from actions affecting the assets of GEM, including its
rights to mine gold deposits or its contractual rights and thereby affecting the
value of their shares. It is therefore important to note that Claimants must
prove that their claims arise out of the Treaty itself and not merely be an
attempt to exercise contractual rights belonging to GEM. To argue that
Claimants could not make such Treaty claims would render it practically
meaningless in many instances; a large number of countries require foreign
investors to incorporate a local company in order to engage into activities in
sectors which are considered of strategic importance (mining, oil and gas,
communications etc.). In such situations, a BIT would be rendered practically
without effect if it were right to argue that any action taken by a State against
such local companies or their assets would be not be subject to Treaty claims
by a foreign investor because its investment is merely constituted of shares in
that local company.”*?? (Emphasis added).

As clearly and consistently established by the above referenced decisions — all of which
were invoked or discussed by Claimants in their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction — a
shareholder of a company incorporated in the host State may assert claims based on
measures taken against such company’s assets that impair the value of the claimant’s
shares. However, such claimant has no standing to pursue claims directly over the

assets of the local company, as it has no legal right to such assets.

In the present case, Istrokapital has not relied on its shareholding in PoStova banka as
the basis of its claim: indeed, as stated in Claimants’ Counter-Memorial on
Jurisdiction, “/tJo be clear, Istrokapital’s protected investment is its indirect investment
in the Greek Bonds, not its shareholding in Postovad Bank.”*?> Istrokapital thus has
expressly sought to base the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on its alleged “indirect investment”
in the GGBs held by PoStova banka. However, Istrokapital has failed to establish that it
has any right to the assets of PoStova banka that qualifies for protection under the
Cyprus-Greece BIT. Therefore, this Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Istrokapital’s

claims in the present arbitration.

76

247. Considering that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over Istrokapital’s claims in
this arbitration for the reasons expressed above, there is no need to undertake a detailed
analysis of whether the GGBs qualify or not as an investment under the Cyprus-Greece
BIT, or to analyze the interplay between the Cyprus-Greece BIT and the ICSID
Convention, or the objections ratione personae or other objections to jurisdiction

related exclusively to Istrokapital.*”*

b. Whether PoStova Banka’s GGB Interests Are Protected Investments Under
the Slovakia-Greece BIT

248. The Parties do not dispute that under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, in order for
the Tribunal to have jurisdiction ratione materiae over the dispute submitted to this
Tribunal, it is necessary that the dispute relate to an investment. The Parties, however,
disagree as to how the term “investment” should be construed under Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention and Article 1(1) of the Slovakia—Greece BIT, and as to whether, in

the light of the aforesaid provisions, the rights that PoStova banka claims to have under

the GGBs are to be considered an investment.

249. The Parties do not contest that the VCLT contains the relevant provisions for the
interpretation of the Slovakia-Greece BIT and the ICSID Convention. The Parties are
in dispute, however, concerning the interplay between the aforementioned treaties and
the VCLT and the results of the application of the VCLT to the aforementioned BIT
and ICSID Convention.

250. In order to determine whether the rights of PoStova banka under the relevant GGBs

qualify as an investment under the Slovakia-Greece BIT, the Tribunal will first refer to

#4 However, even if the Tribunal had found that Istrokapital had standing to claim for the alleged injury to
PoStova banka’s interest in the GGBs, Istrokapital’s claims would still fail under the Cyprus-Greece BIT for
substantially the same reasons contained in the following section of this Award. For the Tribunal, it is clear
that there are some differences between the chapeau of the Cyprus-Greece BIT and the chapeau of the
Slovakia-Greece BIT, and that the list of examples of what may constitute an investment differ in some cases
between both treaties. But it is also clear that, first, the list of examples of the Cyprus-Greece BIT expressly
refers to bonds, but only in respect of bonds issued by companies; second, there is no reference to financial
instruments (not even, as in the case of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, a reference to loans); third, there is no
language that suggests that the State parties intended to include public debt or public obligations, and last but
not least, a general reference to “monetary claims” cannot be expanded to include instruments such as the
GGBs, for the reasons explained in the analysis ined in the foll ig of this Award.

the relevant facts relating to the issuance of the GGBs and the acquisition thereof by
PoStova banka (1). The Tribunal will then undertake the analysis of the relevant
provisions of the Slovakia-Greece BIT (2). Finally, the Tribunal will consider how the

ICSID Convention applies to such facts (3).

1. The Issuance of the GGBs and the Acquisition by Postova Banka

In this section, the Tribunal will refer to the process of issuance of the GGBs by
Greece, the actors that intervened in the process, the acquisition of the GGBs by
PoStova banka and the relevant provisions of the norms, contracts and documents that

apply to such issuance and acquisition.

1.1. The Issuance of the GGBs

252. It is undisputed that the GGBs on which Postova banka bases its claims were issued by

Greece between 2007 and 2010 and that they comprise five different series, as follows:

e ISIN GR0114020457, issued on March 2, 2007 pursuant to Ministerial Decision
2/13482/0023A of February 27, 2007, with an interest rate of 4.1% and maturing
on 20 August 2012.4°

e ISIN GR0114021463, issued on March 26, 2008 pursuant to Ministerial Decision
2/20947/0023A of March 18, 2008, with an interest rate of 4% and maturing on
20 August 2013.476

e ISIN GR0110021236, issued on February 17, 2009 pursuant to Ministerial
Decision 2/11184/0023A of February 13, 2009, with an interest rate of 4.3% and
maturing on 20 March 2012.4?”

e ISIN GR0114023485, issued on February 2, 2010 pursuant to Ministerial
Decision 2/6276/0023A of January 29, 2010, with an interest rate of 6.1% and
maturing on 20 August 2015.48

19 June 2020.4

It is also undisputed that the GGBs were subject to Greek law and to the jurisdiction of

Greek courts.**°

Chapter B, Articles 5-12, of Greek Law 2198 of 1994, governs the issuance of

dematerialized titles, such as the GGBs, by the Greek Government.*?!

Law 2198 of 1994 created the System for Monitoring Transactions in Book-entry
Securities (the “System”), administered by the Bank of Greece.**? In accordance with
Article 6 of Law 2198 of 1994, aside from the Greek Government and the Bank of
Greece, “(...) legal or natural persons (Participants) defined either by category or by
name are eligible for membership in the System, subject to approval by a Bank of

Greece Governor's Act."

Participants in the System are the only ones who can hold titles to GGBs, yet securities
acquired by Participants may be transferred to third parties.*** Such transfer “is valid
between the parties and does not bring about legal consequences in favor or against

the Greek Government or the Bank of Greece.”*>

The Participants keep an account in the System and must keep a separate account for

third parties who acquire the securities.**°

Pursuant to Article 8.2 of Law 2198 of 1994, the third party who acquires a security

“has a claim on his Security only against the Participant keeping his investor account.

If the Greek Government has not fulfilled its obligations under paragraph 6 of the
present Article, the investor has claim arising from the Security only against the Greek
Government.”**” Paragraph 6 of Article 8, in turn, provides that “payment of due
interest and principal on Securities by the Greek Government to the Bank of Greece

discharges the Greek Government's obligations.”4**

In addition to the Participants, the Greek regulations provide for the participation of the
“Primary Dealers,” in the syndications and auctions of Greek government securities in
the primary market as well as in trading such securities in the secondary market.*”
Primary Dealers are financial institutions appointed on a yearly basis by joint decision
of the Minister of Economy and Finance and the Governor of the Bank of Greece in

order to provide specialized services in the government securities market.”

The Primary Dealers assume obligations in the following areas: (A) the primary
market, (B) the secondary market, (C) the yield curve and (D) further contribution to

the Greek Government bond market.**!

In connection with the primary market, Primary Dealers “are required during the
whole calendar year for which they have been granted the Primary Dealer status to
participate actively in the auctions with competitive and non-competitive bids for an
amount not less than 2% per year (duration weighted) of the total amount of successful

bids at Government bond and Treasury-bill auctions. In addition, Primary Dealers
v4.2

 
 

participate in syndications of Greek Government securities

In the secondary market, Primary Dealers have the right to carry out transactions in
GGBs on every approved regulated market, but are required during the whole calendar
year for which they have been granted the Primary Dealer status to achieve a minimum

turnover of not less than 2% of the total annual turnover (duration weighted) on the

approved regulated markets.*? The transactions can be settled in the Bank of Greece
Securities Settlement System or in any other Clearing and Settlement System approved

by the Bank of Greece.*#+

263. In addition to the above, Primary Dealers are required, inter alia, as a further
contribution to the Greek Government bond market, to facilitate a broad distribution of
Greek Government securities domestically as well as internationally; to provide the
Greek Government with advice, information on and assessment of market conditions,
and other information pertaining to their status as Primary Dealers; and to submit
certain reports on the activity on the primary and the secondary market.

264. The GGBs in question were issued by syndication or auction to 22 Primary Dealers.“°

265. The operation of the issuance of the GGBs may be summarized as follows: the Greek
Government issued the GGBs through the Bank of Greece System to the Participants in
the System and the Participants paid the consideration due to Greece. Participants in

turn delivered the GGBs to the Primary Dealers, who provided the funds for the

acquisition. Primary Dealers, in turn, sold the GGBs in the secondary market.*“”

1.2. Purchase of the GGBs by Postova Banka

266. The Parties do not dispute that PoStova banka was neither a Participant nor a Primary
Dealer and therefore, PoStova banka did not intervene in the process of issuance of the

GGBs and the initial distribution thereof to the secondary market. Even though PoStova

+47 See Hubbard Report, | 44: “The issuance and distribution of GGBs on the primary and secondary market
can be briefly summarized. Upon issuance of a GGB to a Participant, that Participant transfers funds via the
Bank of Greece to the Hellenic Republic. All payments made by the Hellenic Republic, such as payments of
coupons for GGBs are made exclusively to Participants via the Bank of Greece system, and all payments
received by Greece for GGBs are likewise made only by Participants at the time of issuance. The primary
dealers act as underwriters and intermediaries between Participants and the secondary market. Once the
primary dealers have sold their GGBs into the secondary market the GGB distribution process is complete.”
Professor Hubbard cites to R-108, Article 6 and R-109. This understanding is confirmed by Professor Stulz in
his Cross Examination. See Hearing, Tr., 369:6-371:4.

banka claims that the “/pJarticipants, who are registered in the BoG System, purchased
the Greek Bonds and then immediately sold them to investors, like Postova Bank, on

the secondary market,”"48

there is no evidence that PoStova banka acquired GGBs in
the initial distribution made by Participants and Primary Dealers. On the contrary, the
evidence in the record indicates that PoStovd banka acquired the vast majority of its

interests in the GGBs well after the initial distribution process had been completed, as

It is also undisputed that PoStova banka acquired its interests in the GGBs on the
secondary market and that these interests were held in PoStova banka’s account with

Clearstream, a universal depository.*°°

Under its general terms and conditions, applicable to the purchases made by PoStova
banka, Clearstream opens an account for the deposit of securities of each of its

457 and

customers.*® The securities received by Clearstream are treated as fungible
“[nJo Customer shall have any right to specific securities but, each Customer will
instead be entitled, subject to these General Terms and Conditions, to require CBL
[Clearstream Banking, Luxembourg] to deliver to the Customer or a third party an
amount of securities of an issue equivalent to the amount credited to any securities
account in the Customer’s name, without regard to the certificate numbers of any
securities certificates.”?*

Cleastream’s general terms and conditions provide further for the obligation of
Clearstream to “promptly transmit to the appropriate agent of the issuer any order
received from a Customer constituting the exercise of a right, option or warrant held

for the account of such Customer.”*?

The Parties debate whether, as a result of the aforesaid purchases, PoStova banka held
GGBs, or “interests” in GGBs, or rights in a pool of fungible assets, and on whether

GGBs and “interests” on GGBs are different securities subject to different treatment.

PoStova banka initially classified in its accounting books and records the interests that
it acquired in the GGBs as HTM and as AFS, and later on reclassified some GGBs
from AFS to HTM.‘ The Parties debate as to the whether such initial classification

and further reclassification reflects an intent of having a long-term investment.

It is uncontested that at the time of the purchases of the GGBs by PoStova banka, the
Slovak regulator, NBS, had designated Eurozone bonds, including GGBs, as “zero
risk,” so PoStova banka did not need to hold capital against them. However, in the

market the GGBs had already been downgraded to BB+ by rating agencies.**!

1.3. The Sales and Assignments by Postovd Banka of Its Interests in the
GGBs

During 2011, PoStova banka sold all of its interests in the GGBs in its AFS portfolio.
The sale comprised three of the five series of GGB interests it had bought (ISIN
GRO0124032666, ISIN GRO114023485 and ISIN GRO114020457), accounting for about
18% of the value of Postova banka’s GGBs holdings.‘ Immediately after the sale,
PoStova banka purchased GGB interests of the same series and in the same principal
amounts, but for a different price.* Postova banka states that it made these trades to
ensure that the bank met its statutory capital adequacy and capital exposure limits,** as

well as a way to book its losses related to GGBs in its profit and loss account.4

Also, in 2011, through the Assignment Agreements, which involved J&T Finance and
Istrokapital, Postova banka assigned part of its interests in the GGBs to J&T Finance.
The Assignment Agreements terminated or lost effect at a date that is the subject matter

of debate between the Parties.

Claimants assert, and Respondent does not dispute, that from the different dates of
acquisition of the interests in the GGBs by PoStova banka up to the date in which the
exchange became effective, PoStova banka received payments of capital and interest

corresponding to the interests it held in the GGBs.*°

2. Article 1 of the Slovakia-Greece BIT

276. The Tribunal will first determine whether, in light of the facts summarized above and
the evidence in the record, the interests held by PoStova banka in the GGBs qualify as

an investment under Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT.

277. If there is no protected investment under the Slovakia-Greece BIT, the dispute subject
matter of this arbitration will not be a dispute related to an investment, as required in
Article 10(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT which contains the consent of the parties to
arbitration, and therefore such dispute will not fall under the jurisdiction of ICSID and

the competence of this Tribunal under the aforementioned Article 25.
278. Article 1 (“Definitions”) of the Slovakia~Greece BIT provides:

For the purposes of this Agreement:

1. “Investment” means every kind of asset and in particular, though not
exclusively includes:

a) movable and immovable property and any other property rights such as
mortgages, liens or pledges,

b) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of
participation in a company,

c) loans, claims to money or to any performance under contract having a
financial value,

d) intellectual property rights, goodwill, technical processes and know-how,

business concessions conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to
search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources.

2. "Returns" means the amounts yielded by an investment and in particular,
though not exclusively, includes profit, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties
and other fees.

3. "Investor" shall comprise with regard to either Contracting Party:

a) natural persons having the nationality of that Contracting Party in
accordance with its law

b) legal persons constituted in accordance with the law of that Contracting
Party.

4, "Territory" means in respect of either Contracting Party, the territory

under its sovereignty as well as the territorial sea and submarine areas, over which

85

279.

280.

281.

282.

that Contracting Party exercises, in conformity with international law, sovereign

rights or jurisdiction.”
As summarized under paragraphs 127 to 132 above, Claimants claim that their interests
in GGBs are included in what they consider a broad definition of “investment”
contained in the chapeau of Article 1 of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, and under section (c)
of the same article, because Claimants’ interests in the GGBs are either “loans” or
“claims to money” or both. In reading the Slovakia-Greece BIT, Claimants consider
that there is no inherent meaning of investment under international law and that the
Tribunal, pursuant to Article 31(4) of the VCLT must simply apply the special meaning

ascribed to the term “investment” by the State parties to the Slovakia-Greece BIT.

Respondent, in turn, considers that the term “investment” contained in the aforesaid
chapeau of Article 1 has an inherent meaning under international law and that a correct
interpretation of Article 31(4) of the VCLT leads to the conclusion that there is no

special definition of the term “investment” under the treaty.

Articles 31(1) and 31(2) of the VCLT require interpretation of a treaty:

  

“(1)...in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the
terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.

(2) The context for the purposes of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise,
in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes: (a) any agreement
related to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with
the conclusion of the treaty; (b) any instrument which was made by one or
more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by
the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.”4°"

The heading of Article 31 of the VCLT calls that article a “general rule of
interpretation” meaning that the elements contained in Article 31(1) form a single rule
of interpretation and may not be taken separately or in isolation. As indicated by the

tribunal in Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia:

“Interpretation under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention is a process of
progressive encirclement where the interpreter starts under the general rule
with (1) the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty, (2) in their context and

(3) in light of the treaty’s object and purpose, and by cycling through this three
step inquiry iteratively closes in upon the proper interpretation. In
approaching this task, it is critical to observe two things about the general rule
(...). First, the Vienna Convention does not privilege anyone of these three
aspects of the interpretation method. The meaning of a word or phrase is not
solely a matter of dictionary and linguistics. (...’*°

In other words, “the application of the means of interpretation in the article would be a

single combined operation. All the various elements, as they were present in any given

case, would be thrown in to the crucible, and their interaction would give the legally

relevant interpretation.“

In the view of this Tribunal, an interpretation in good faith is not simply interpretation
bona fides, as opposed to the absence of mala fides, or a principle providing for the
rejection of an interpretation that is abusive or that may result in the abuse of rights. It
also means that the interpretation requires elements of reasonableness that go beyond

the mere verbal or purely literal analysis.

The chapeau of Article 1 of the Slovakia-Greece BIT provides that for the purposes of
the treaty “fiJnvestment means every kind of asset and in particular, though not
exclusively includes: (...).” In turn section (c) of Article 1 refers to “loans, claims to

money or to any performance under contract having a financial value.”

The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that the concept of “investment” as contained in
Article 1 of the Slovakia-Greece BIT is a broad one. The BIT contains a broad asset-
based concept of investment — as opposed to a closed or limitative concept — and
considers that an investment includes “every kind of asset” comprising the examples of

investments listed in Article 1.

However, the Tribunal is not persuaded that a broad definition necessarily means that
any and all categories, of any nature whatsoever, may qualify as an “investment,” nor

that the only manner in which a category may be excluded as an investment, under a

broad-asset based concept, is by express exclusion in the given treaty. The rule of
interpretation of Article 31 of the VCLT must be applied to each treaty in particular,
and not seeking to create general categories or classifications of treaties, depending on

whether the definition is broad or closed.

288. It is true that when a treaty includes examples of categories that may constitute an
investment, such as the ones contained in Article 1 of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, the
structure of the treaty, as regards protected investments, is not that of a closed list or an
exhaustive description of what may constitute an investment. But this does not mean
that investor-State tribunals are authorized to expand the scope of the investments that
the State parties intended to protect merely because the list of protected investments in
the treaty is not a closed list. The rule of interpretation of Article 31 of the VCLT
requires that the terms of the treaty be interpreted in good faith, and not only referring

to the text but to the context, as well as considering the object and purpose of the treaty.

289. Several treaties, including the Slovakia-Greece BIT, contain similar — and even
identical — concepts of “investment” in the chapeau of the article that refers to
protected investments. In fact, the same chapeau contained in Article 1 of the Slovakia-
Greece BIT, with a broad asset-based concept, is repeated not only in a significant
number of Greek BITs but also in a number of other treaties referred to in decisions

repeatedly cited by the Parties to this arbitration.

290. As to Greek treaties, the same or similar chapeau is used, inter alia, in the BITs with

Albania (1991),4”° Romania (1991),47! Cyprus (1992), and Romania (1997).47

292. However, the list of categories that follows the introductory phase and that illustrates
what may constitute an investment varies — in some cases substantially — from one
treaty to another. In the above cited cases of Greek treaties, while some include, for
example, the term “loans,” others refer to “long term loans,” others to loans “connected
to an investment” and others — which is the case of the Cyprus-Greece BIT — exclude
the term “loan” altogether. As for the treaties that served as bases for the decisions

mentioned in 291 above, the examples vary significantly from one treaty to the other.

293. Interpretation of a treaty in good faith, considering not only the text but also the
context, requires that the interpreter provide some meaning to the examples and to the
content of such examples as part of the context of the treaty. The interpretation in good
faith, be it considered alone or in conjunction with the object and purpose of the treaty,
embodies the principle of effectiveness (ut res magis valeat quem pererat). Preference
should be given to an interpretation that provides meaning to all the terms of the treaty

as opposed to one that does not. As indicated by the Appellate Body of the WTO:

“We have also recognized, on several occasions, the principle of effectiveness
in the interpretation of treaties (ut res magis valeat quem pererat) which
requires that a treaty interpreter: ‘...must give meaning and effect to all the
terms of the treaty. An interpreter is not free to adopt a reading that would
result in reducing whole clauses or paragraphs of a treaty to redundancy or
inutility’. In light of the interpretative principle of effectiveness, it is the duty of
any treaty interpreter to ‘read all applicable provisions of a treaty in a way
that gives meaning to all of them, harmoniously’. An important corollary of this
principle is that a treaty should be interpreted as a whole, and, in particular,
its sections and parts should be read as a whole.”**°

296.

The list of examples provided by the Slovakia-Greece BIT must, thus, be considered in
the context of the treaty and be given some meaning together. Otherwise, if the
interpretation stops by simply indicating that any asset is an investment, the examples
will be unnecessary, redundant or useless. Treaties are carefully drafted and negotiated,
and the differences in the examples used in the treaties that contain a broad-based
definition of assets are not fortuitous. States include categories of investments as
examples for some purpose. Otherwise, it would be sufficient to define investment as
any kind of assets of any nature without including examples of what may constitute an

investment.

This does not mean that the list of examples becomes a closed or exhaustive list. Based
on the understanding that the concept of asset is a broad one and the examples are such
and not limitative lists, the examples altogether must be considered and given meaning

to arrive at the proper interpretation of the treaty.

The reasoning of the tribunal in the decision of Fedax v. Venezuela, repeatedly invoked
in this arbitration, assigned substantial weight to the wording of the list of examples
contained in Article 1(1) of the BIT between Venezuela and the Netherlands. In the

words of that tribunal:

“It follows that, as contemplated by the Convention, the definition of
‘investment’ is controlled by consent of the Contracting Parties, and the
particular definition set forth in Article I (a) of the Agreement is the one that
governs the jurisdiction of ICSID:

[T]he term Investments’ shall comprise every kind of asset and more
particularly though not exclusively:

(ii) rights derived from shares, bonds, and other kinds of interests in
companies and joint ventures;

(iii) titles to money, to other assets or to any performance having an
economic value ...’

This definition evidences that the Contracting Parties to the Agreement
intended a very broad meaning for the term ‘investment.’ The Tribunal notes in
particular that titles to money in this definition are not in any way restricted to

 

 

92

forms of direct foreign investment or portfolio investment, as argued by the
Republic of Venezuela. Some such _restrictions may perhaps apply to other
types of investment listed in such definition, such as rights derived from shares
or other similar types of investment, but_they do not apply to_the credit
transactions of different categories that are embodied in the ing of ‘titles
to money’ as referred to in subparagraph (iii) of the definition set out above. It
should be noted, moreover, that titles to money are not necessarily excluded
from the concept of direct foreign investment. ”**!

 

 

297. The Fedax v. Venezuela tribunal was not only persuaded by the broad context of the
chapeau of the relevant provision, but by the inclusion in the list of assets that may

constitute an investment of the term “titles to money.”

298. In the decision on jurisdiction and admissibility in Abaclat v. Argentina, cited by the
Parties in this arbitration and invoked by Claimants to support the allegation that there
is no inherent meaning for the term “investment,” the tribunal devotes several pages of
reasoning to whether or not the term “obligaciones” (in the Spanish version) and
“obligazioni” (in the Italian version) should be translated as “obligations” or as
“bonds” and as to whether or not bonds, considering the wording in the examples

provided under Article 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT, qualified as an investment.

299. In its analysis of Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, and specifically in its review
of the examples contained in the aforesaid Article, the Abaclat tribunal reasoned as

follows:

“According to the Tribunal‘s own English translation of Article 1(1) BIT, the
term ‘investment includes, without limitation’:

- lit. (a): ‘movable and immovable goods, as well as any other right in rem,
including — to the extent usable as investment — security rights on property of
third parties;’

- lit. (b): ‘shares, company participations and any other form of
participation, even if representing a minority or indirectly held, in companies
established in the territory of a Contracting State;’

- lit. (c): ‘obligations, private or public titles or any other right to
performances or services having economic value, including capitalized
revenues;’

“8! Fedax v. Venezuela, Wf 31-32. (Emphasis added).

93

- lit. (d): ‘credits which are directly linked to an investment, which is
constituted and documented in accordance with the provisions in force in the
State where the investment is made;’

- lit. (e): ‘copyrights, intellectual or industrial property rights — such as
invention patents, licenses, registered trademarks, secrets, industrial models
and designs — as well as technical processes, transfer of technology, registered
trade names and goodwill;’

- lit. (): ‘any right of economic nature conferred under law or contract, as
well as any license and concession granted in compliance with the applicable
provisions applicable to the concerned economic activities, including the
prospection, cultivation, extraction and exploitation of natural resources’.”

(..)

“Firstly, this list covers an extremely wide range of investments, using a broad
wording and referring to formulas such as ‘independent of the legal form
adopted,’ or ‘any other’ kind of similar investment. It even contains a residual
clause in lit. (f), encompassing ‘any right of economic nature conferred under
law or contract.’ In other words, the definition provided for in Article 1(1) is
not drafted in a restrictive way. Based on its wording, as well as on the
broader aim of the BIT as described in the Preamble, Article 1(1) cannot be
seen to have intended to adopt a restrictive approach with regard to what kind
of activity or dealing was meant to qualify as an investment.

“Secondly, lit.(c) specifically addresses financial instruments. It is true that the
term ‘obligations’ is a broad term and can refer to any kind of contractual
obligation, i.e., debt, and it is also true that the term ‘title’ is also very broad.
However, put in the context of the further terms listed in lit. (c) such as
‘economic value’ or ‘capitalized revenue,’ as well as considering that lit. ()
already deals with the more general concept of ‘any right of economic nature,’
lit. (c) is to be read as referring to the financial meaning of these terms. Thus,
the term ‘obligation’ may be understood as referring to an economic value
incorporated into a credit title representing a loan. This kind of obligations
would in the English language more commonly be called ‘bond,’ rather than
‘obligation.’ Similarly, the term ‘title’ in Spanish and Italian would be more
accurately translated into the English term of ‘security,’ which means nothing
more than a fungible, negotiable instrument representing financial value.

“Thus, the Tribunal finds that the bonds, as defined above in § 11, constitute

‘obligations’ and/or at least ‘public securities’ in the sense of Article 1(1) lit.
(c) of the BIT.

“With regard to the security entitlements that Claimants hold in these bonds,
they also represent ‘securities’ in the sense of Article 1(1) lit. (c), since they
constitute an instrument representing a financial value held by the holder of the
security entitlement in the bond issued by Argentina.”***

The tribunal in Abaclat v. Argentina, thus, paid due regard to the list of examples
contained in Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT and was persuaded by the fact that
the list, interpreted in context with the preamble and the chapeau of Article 1, (i)
covered “an extremely wide range of investments, using a broad wording and referring
to formulas such as ‘independent of the legal form adopted.’ or ‘any other’ kind of
similar investment,;”*® (ii) contained “a residual clause in lit. (f), encompassing ‘any
right of economic nature conferred under law or contract”;*** (iii) specifically
addressed financial instruments because “the term ‘obligation’ may be understood as
referring to an economic value incorporated into a credit title representing a loan

(7485

The conclusion of the Abaclat tribunal was that the terms “obligations” and “public
securities” were wide enough to encompass the bonds that were the subject of the

dispute in that arbitration.

The Ambiente Ufficio tribunal also considered in detail the list of examples in Article
1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT as a key element to its conclusion that bonds are
covered either because the word “obligaciones” or “obligatzioni” should be translated
as bonds, or because what the tribunal calls a “catch-all clause” covers rights derived

from law or contract.**°

In sum, the decisions that have specifically analysed issues related to financial products
similar to those at issue in this case have consistently considered the text of the list of
categories that may constitute an investment as a definitive element to determine

whether the activity or operation at stake may be considered an investment.

The language in the Slovakia-Greece BIT, as will be analysed below, is significantly
different from the one that led the Abaclat and Ambiente Ufficio tribunals to conclude

that government bonds were investments under the Argentina-Italy BIT.

_

First, as opposed to the wide language quoted by the Abaclat tribunal from the
Argentina-Italy BIT, that includes general formulas such as “independent of the legal
form adopted,” the language used in the chapeau of Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece

BIT simply provides that “/iJnvestment means any type of asset and in particular,

Second, the list of examples of Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, and
particularly the sections invoked by Claimants in support of their interpretation of the
relevant BIT, are substantially different from the ones invoked by the Abaclat and
Ambiente Ufficio tribunals under the Argentina-Italy BIT. Article 1(c) of the Argentina-
Italy BIT, invoked by the Abaclat and Ambiente Ufficio tribunals as the basis for their
conclusion, includes amongst the illustrative list of what may constitute an investment
“obligations, private or public titles or any other right to performances or services
having economic value, including capitalized revenues.” (Emphasis added) In
contrast, Article 1.1(c) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT refers to “loans, claims to money or

to any performance under contract having a financial value.” There is no reference in
the Slovakia-Greece BIT to a general concept such as “obligations,” much less to

“public titles.”

Third, the Slovakia-Greece BIT does not contain the wide language that the Abaclat
tribunal considered as language that would comprise bonds, i.e., “any right of economic
nature conferred under law or contract.” “Any right of an economic nature” is a wider

concept than claims to money under contract.

A wide term like “obligations” — particularly in the context in which it must be
understood in civil law systems — and a reference to “private or public titles” may well
lead, as it seems to have led the Abaclat and Ambiente Ufficio tribunals, to the
conclusion that a Government bond is generally an obligation and specifically a public
title. However, the same conclusion may not be reached when a treaty, interpreted in
accordance with the rules of interpretation of the VCLT, includes less encompassing

language.

312.

The preamble of the Slovakia-Greece BIT indicates that the State parties entered into

the BIT

“DESIRING to intensify their economic cooperation to the mutual benefit of
both countries on a long term basis;

“HAVING as their objective to create favorable conditions for investments by
investors of either Party in the territory of the other Party;

“RECOGNIZING that the promotion and protection of investment, on the basis

of the present Agreement, will stimulate the initiative in this field.”
The objective of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, as pleaded by Claimants, is for the State
parties to the treaty to create favorable conditions for investments by investors. But this
does not mean that, in case of doubt, the treaty must be interpreted in favor of the
investor, or that protecting investments is the sole purpose of the treaty. The State
parties, in addition to expressing their desire to intensify their mutual cooperation (first
section of the Preamble), agree that it is necessary to create favorable conditions to
investors (second section of the Preamble) and then recognize that the promotion and
protection of investment “on the basis of the present Agreement, will stimulate the
initiative in this field” (third section of the Preamble). The conclusion seems obvious:
the promotion and protection of the investments made by the investor of one State
party in the territory of the other State party is “on the basis” of the Slovakia-~Greece

BIT, i.e., subject to the terms of the BIT.

The terms of the BIT are contained in its 13 articles, which start with the chapeau of
Article 1(1) which, as already mentioned, provides that “[i]nvestment means every kind
of asset and in particular, but not exclusively, includes:” The chapeau is followed by a
list of what, “in particular, but not exclusively,” the parties to the treaty deem included

as an “investment.”

If the chapeau of Article 1(1) is interpreted in isolation, in a mere literal manner or
solely in conjunction with Article 1(1)(c), it would mean that: (i) any asset of any
nature whatsoever would qualify as an investment under the Slovakia-Greece BIT; but
(ii) that the list contained in Article 1(1) of the BIT would be useless or meaningless.

An interpretation of the chapeau, considering its text and context within Article 1(1) of

97

313.

the BIT, and the object and purpose of the treaty, as required by the VCLT, leads to a

different result.

w

Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT initially provides for a broad concept by
indicating that investment “means any kind of asset.” But then uses the words “and in
particular” (which means, specifically or especially distinguished from others; a term
used to show that a statement applies to one person or thing more than any other),‘*”
followed by the words “but not exclusively, includes,” and a list of what is included.
Article 1(1) of the BIT provides, thus, for a broad concept of investment, that it then
qualifies to indicate that the term applies especially to a specific group or category (the
list contained in sections (a) to (d)), which group or category is not closed, or limited or

restrictive.

314. In other words, an interpretation of the text and context of Article 1(1) leads the

Tribunal to consider that the State parties to the treaty wanted an ample definition of
what could constitute an investment, but within certain categories that are also broad,
but not unlimited. Otherwise, the examples could be expanded to include any asset

whatsoever, and would become useless or meaningless.

315. The categories selected by the State parties must be considered in determining if an

asset, that may constitute an investment, is included in the categories of investments
selected by the States. In such consideration, the Tribunal must balance the broadness

of the categories with the limits that result from their inclusion in the treaty.

316. Based on the above, an interpretation of Article 1 (1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT

requires a determination of whether PoStova banka’s interests in the GGBs fit within
the specific, but wide, category or group of investments listed in sections (a) to (f), and

specifically a determination as to whether, in the words of Claimants, the GGBs “fall

squarely within Article 1.1 (c) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT (“loans, claims to money or

to any performance under contract having a financial value”) (...).*°8

317. The Tribunal has no doubt and the Parties do not seem to dispute that, on the one hand,

the GGBs constitute sovereign debt, and on the other, that they are securities.*8?

318. Sovereign debt, as indebtedness of a sovereign State, has special features and
characteristics. First, it is clearly a method of financing government operations, from

investments in infrastructure to ordinary government expenditures.

319. Second, it is a key instrument of monetary and economic policy (e.g., indebtedness
may be incurred to avoid either the issuance of fresh money — that may create
hyperinflation — or an increase in taxes; or, as in the case at hand, for political reasons,
regulators may decide to rate sovereign debt at zero risk despite the rating of the debt in

the market).

320. Third, sovereign debt is subject to a high degree of political influence and risk. A
sovereign State engages in much more complex decisions, both in negotiating and
structuring the debt and in payment thereof, and repayment is subject not only to the
normal credit risk of any credit operation, but also to political decisions that are
extremely sensitive for the inhabitants of the given State, such as a tax increase or a
reduction in public expenditure or investment to repay the sovereign debt. Moreover,
given the above considerations, it has been hotly debated whether sovereign

indebtedness is an act of the sovereign or a commercial operation.*”

321. Fourth, while ordinary credits generally embody the interest of the main parties to the
credit agreement — debtor and creditor — and the influence of third parties is limited,
sovereign debt is highly influenced to different degrees by both internal and external

factors.

322. Fifth, the only security for the creditors of sovereign debt is normally the full faith and
credit of the given State. Moreover, as a general rule there is no strict seniority in
sovereign debt issues and therefore, existing creditors may see their debt “diluted” by

subsequent new bond issuances.

323. Last, but not least, creditors have much more limited legal resources if a sovereign
debtor fails to make a contracted payment considering issues of immunity that only

apply to sovereigns.

324. In sum, sovereign debt is an instrument of government monetary and economic policy
and its impact at the local and international levels makes it an important tool for the
handling of social and economic policies of a State. It cannot, thus, be equated to

private indebtedness or corporate debt.

325. As regards government bonds, the facts presented and documented by the Parties in
this case confirm that they are securities and as such are subject to specific and strict

regulations.

326. An issuance of bonds in the European context requires that an offer of securities to the
public within the territory of an EU Member State must be preceded by the publication
of a prospectus and that the publication of the prospectus is made subject to the
approval of the competent authority of the home Member State, in this case the
Respondent.**! Approval of the prospectus is subject to specific requirements under the
law of the issuing State and must consider the applicable laws of the State or States
where the bonds will be traded. Moreover, the bonds may need to include or exclude
certain provisions or disclaimers so as to prevent the application of strict legislation of

States where the bonds will be traded.4”

Managers do not represent that this document may be lawfully distributed or that the Bonds may be lawfully

327. The evidence submitted by the Parties, including the expert reports, describes in detail
the operation of bonds in the primary and secondary markets and the fact that bonds are
easily tradable on the secondary market, with clearing houses acting as intermediaries
or as administrators, but under contract with the bondholders.*”? As a result, creditors
change many times during the life of the bond, and there is no requirement to notify or

inform the issuing State about the changes of holders in the secondary market.

328. Bonds issued by a Sovereign are subject to ratings by rating agencies and to a
continuous monitoring of the State’s credit rating (which in turn varies depending on a
number of factors, including changes in the government, the adoption of economic
measures, including tax measures, and variation in the international prices of

commodities produced by the given State).

329. The requirements, characteristics and tradability of the GGBs are amply documented in
the record. The Tribunal has no doubt that GGBs are sovereign debt, in the form of
securities, in general, and bonds, in particular, that are subject to strict requirements in
their issuance. These securities are heavily regulated not only by the issuing State, but
in the markets where they are traded, including measures adopted by the banking
regulators and rules on to how they should be accounted for and rated for purposes of
the balance sheet of the bondholders subject to special regulations, such as the case of

PoStova banka.

 

‘for that purpose is required. Accordingly, the Bonds may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and
neither this Offering Circular nor any advertisement or other offering material may be distributed or
published, in any jurisdiction except under circumstances that will result in compliance with any applicable
laws and regulations. Persons into whose possession this Offering Circular or any Bonds come must inform
themselves about, and observe, any such restrictions.

The Bonds have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act”), or under any state securities law. Unless so registered, the Bonds may not
be offered or sold within the United States except in a transaction that is exempt from or not subject to any
registration requirement. As a result, the Bonds are only being offered (a) to qualified institutional buyers as
defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) in compliance with Rule 144A and (b) pursuant
to offers and sales in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”). Prospective
purchasers of the Bonds are hereby notified that the sellers of the Bonds may be relying on the exemption
from the provisions of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. See ‘Subscription and Sale’.” R-110, p. 2.

330. The question that the Tribunal must address is, therefore, whether the wide list of
investments provided for under Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT includes

sovereign debt in general and, if so, the GGBs in particular.

331.

It is clear to the Tribunal that the list of investments contained in Article 1(1) of the
Slovakia-Greece BIT does not include the language of the Italy-Argentina BIT from
which the Abaclat tribunal derived its conclusions on admissibility and jurisdiction,
and specifically, does not contain any reference to “obligations” or to “securities,”

much less to public titles or obligations.

332. Neither Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT nor other provisions of the treaty refer,
in any way, to sovereign debt, public titles, public securities, public obligations or the
like. The Slovakia-Greece BIT does not contain language that may suggest that the
State parties considered, in the wide category of investments of the list of Article 1(1)
of the BIT, public debt or public obligations, much less sovereign debt, as an

investment under the treaty.

333. The only reference to bonds in the Slovakia-Greece BIT is in Article 1(1)(b) which
refers to “shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of
participation in a company” (emphasis added). The text leaves no doubt that the bonds
referred to under Article 1(1)(b) are only bonds issued by a company — debentures of a
company — not sovereign debt in general, or bonds issued by either State party to the
treaty, in particular. Respondent argues, and the Tribunal agrees, that sovereign bonds
are different from forms of participation in corporations, and therefore their exclusion

from the definition of investment in a given treaty indicates that the contracting parties

did not intend to cover these types of assets.4°*

4°4 See Hearing, Tr., 441:9-442:4: “There is a fundamental difference between shares, corporate bonds and
other forms of participation in a company on the one hand and sovereign bonds on the other hand. Shares
and cory bonds are ic with ac ic ing in the host State. Now, a Shareholder
owns part of the company, and a corporate bond is a claim to a portion of the company's profit. Now,
sovereign bonds, by contrast, are not associated with the commercial undertaking in the host State. They
typically serve general budgetary purposes. Well, there are important differences between corporate bonds
on the one hand and sovereign bonds even at the time of the issuance of the sovereign bonds, and this is
particularly so with respect to sovereign bonds that are not linked with specific economic activity in the host
State such as the Greek Government Bonds at issue in this arbitration.”

102

 

334.

335.

336.

337.

338.

It is indeed telling that the State parties have specifically referred under section (b) to
“any form of participation in a company,” which includes bonds, but is clearly limited
to bonds issued by companies, and have not included bonds in general under section (c)
or in any other provision of the treaty. The provisions of treaties are, as both Parties
recognize,*”> carefully and extensively negotiated. The express inclusion of debentures
issued by companies and the omission of any other reference to bonds or to public
obligations in the treaty must be given some meaning for purposes of the interpretation

of the text and context of the treaty.

It is therefore clear that in the context of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, and particularly in
Article 1(1)(b) the State parties considered some types of bonds as investments, but the

reference to bonds is limited to bonds issued by a company.

In Article 1(1)(c) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, the State parties to the treaty included
“loans” as an example of an investment and Claimants consider that such term includes
the GGBs. The wide interpretation of the text of Article 1(1)(c) proposed by Claimants
considers that the GGBs, which are securities, bonds, clearly fit into the category of
investments described in the words “loans, claims to money or to any performance

under contract having a financial value.” The Tribunal disagrees.

Loans and bonds are distinct financial products. The creditor in a loan is generally a
bank or group of banks, normally identified in the pertinent agreement. Bonds are
generally held by a large group of creditors, generally anonymous. Moreover, unlike
creditors in a loan, the creditors of bonds may change several times in a matter of days
or even hours, as bonds are traded. The tradability of loans or syndicated loans is
generally limited, and precisely because loans are generally not tradable, they are not

subject to the restrictions or regulations that apply to securities.

The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that loans involve contractual privity between the
lender and the debtor, while bonds do not involve contractual privity. The lender has a

direct relationship with the debtor — in the case of public debt, the State — as party to

“5 C-Mem., 92; Hearing, Tr., 440:13-443:8.

103

339.

340.

341.

the same contract — the loan agreement — while in the issuance of bonds the contractual
relationship of the State is with the intermediaries — in the case at hand with the
Participants and the Primary Dealers. The holders of the bonds — the ultimate creditors,
holders of the bonds — have a contractual relationship with the intermediary or the

clearing house where the bonds are acquired or both.

The facts of this case and particularly the various operations undertaken by PoStova
banka with the GGBs confirm the above. PoStova banka acquired the GGBs under a
contract with Clearstream, sold the GGBs back through Clearstream under the same
contract. Thereafter, PoStova banka assigned rights to the GGBs to third parties under
the Assignment Agreements and then terminated such agreements pursuant to a
Settlement Agreement. It treated the GGBs as bonds in its financial statements for the
purposes that have been amply debated in this arbitration. If PoStova banka had granted
a loan to Greece, as opposed to having acquired bonds in the secondary market, it
would have had a direct contractual relationship with Greece, and the fast tradability of
the bonds — without involving Greece — which allowed PoStova banka to sell,
repurchase, assign and reverse the assignment, in some cases in matter of hours,
without even informing the State debtor in any step of the operation, would not have

been possible.

Again, the specific use of the term “debentures” only for debt issued by companies in
Article 1(1)(b) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT and the specific use of the term “loans” in
another section of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, Article 1(1)(c) , together with the lack of
reference to any sort of public indebtedness, leads the Tribunal to consider that the
Parties to the treaty did not intend to treat government securities, such as the GGBs, as

investments for purposes of the BIT.

In connection with “claims to money,” the other category of investments in Article
1(1)(c) of the BIT which Claimants deem to include GGBs, the Tribunal again

disagrees with the interpretation of Claimants for several reasons.

104

342.

343.

344.

345.

346.

First, a Tribunal should not lightly expand the language of a treaty so as to conclude
that a general reference to “claims to money” includes bonds or other securities issued

by a State, where there is no indication that the State parties intended to do so.

Second, the text of Article 1(1)(c) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT considers as an
investment “claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial
value” (emphasis added). Therefore the investment consists of a claim to money, or a
claim to performance, under a contract having a financial value. In other words, the

claim to money must arise under a contractual relationship.

The contractual relationships in the issuance by Greece in the primary market and the
purchase by PoStova banka in the secondary market have been widely discussed.
Greece had a contractual relationship with the Participants and the Primary Dealers for
the issuance and distribution of the GGBs. It is undisputed that PoStova banka was not
a Participant or a Primary Dealer, and that it therefore had no contractual relationship
with Respondent in connection with such issuance and distribution. PoStova banka
acquired its interests in the GGBs through a transaction with Clearstream, governed by
the laws of Luxembourg, which governed, inter alia, the opening of the corresponding

account for the purchase and sale of the GGBs.

Under Greek Law 2198 of 1994 and the documents governing the issuance and trade of
the GGBs, the rights of PoStova banka — like the rights of other bondholders — were
rights against the Participants. There is nothing in the record that even suggests that
there was a contractual relationship between Respondent and PoStova banka. Postova
banka had certain rights against the Greek Government under the terms of the GGBs,
as discussed below, but such rights would only become exercisable against Respondent
in one specific circumstance: the Greek Government’s failure to pay due interest and

principal on securities to the Bank of Greece.*”°

Even if, as suggested by Claimants, the issuance of the GGBs and the sales in the

secondary market constitute one single economic operation, the Tribunal is not

496 R-108, Article 8.2.

105

347.

348.

349.

350.

convinced that even the fact of considering such unified operation would result in

PoStova banka having a claim to money under contract against Respondent.

The record indicates that PoStova banka never entered into a contract with Respondent
and its contractual relationship under the GGBs was exclusively with the Participants
through Clearstream. In other words, the “claim to money” would not result from a

contract between PoStova banka and Respondent.

PoStova banka holds a right in a title — a right in rem — against the Participants, and
would have rights against Greece, not arising from a contract with Respondent, but
from the title and the consequences provided therein in case the Greek Government
fails to pay principal and interest to the Bank of Greece pursuant to the terms of Law

2198 of 1994.

Since Postova banka does not have a claim to money under contract having a financial

value, it does not have an investment for purposes of Article 1(1) of the BIT.

The Tribunal accordingly concludes that neither of the Claimants is an investor with an
investment as defined in Article 1(1) (c) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT and in Article 1(1)
(c) of the Cyprus-Greece BIT. Based on the above analysis, the Tribunal concludes
that it lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae to entertain this dispute. In light of this
conclusion, the Tribunal does not deem it necessary to examine the remaining
objections to jurisdiction advanced by Respondent, concerning absence of jurisdiction
ratione personae and ratione temporis, nor the allegations concerning abuse of process

and the umbrella clause.

2. Analysis of the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction Under the Washington Convention

351.

a. The Tribunal Need Not Determine Whether It Would Have Jurisdiction
Under the Washington Convention in the Circumstances of the Case

The Tribunal’s conclusion concerning the definition of “investment” under the
Slovakia-Greece BIT in Section VI.1 above makes it unnecessary for the Tribunal to

resolve the dispute between the Parties concerning whether PoStova banka’s GGBs

106

352.

353.

would be considered investments as that term is used in the Washington (ICSID)
Convention. Because the Parties have devoted significant attention to that issue,

however, the Tribunal feels it appropriate to refer to such disagreement.”

According to Article 25(1) of the Washington Convention:

“The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out
of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or
agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national
of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to
submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may
withdraw its consent unilaterally.”

It is well known that the drafters of the Washington Convention intentionally chose not

to include a definition of investment within that convention.”

In a number of well-known cases, tribunals have attempted to deal with this omission
of a definition by articulating what they have called “objective criteria” for the
definition of the term “investment” that are said to flow from the object and purpose of
the ICSID Convention. Those tribunals have concluded that such criteria cannot be set
aside by a consent that may have been given in another legal instrument, such as a BIT.
An example of such an approach is the one taken by the ad hoc Committee in the
Patrick Mitchell v. Congo annulment proceeding, which expressed its understanding of
the limits of the notion of investment in the following terms:

“[T]he parties to an agreement and the States which conclude an investment treaty

cannot open the jurisdiction of the Centre to any operation they might arbitrarily
qualify as an investment. It is thus repeated that, before ICSID arbitral tribunals,

+°7 The Tribunal here takes a similar approach as in Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria where the tribunal
explained that:

“The Parties have extensively documented their allegations; numerous exhibits, witness statements
and expert reports have been submitted by both Parties. The factual and legal arguments have been
discussed in detail during the Final Hearing, in which a number of witnesses and experts were also
examined by the Parties and the arbitrators. The Tribunal has therefore decided that, in
acknowledgement of the Parties’ efforts, it will consider their further allegations on the merits.”

147.

 

“88 See MHS Annulment, {ff 65-71.

107

the Washington Convention has supremacy over an agreement between the parties
ora BIT."

354. The same position was articulated in Phoenix:

“At the outset, it should be noted that BITs, which are bilateral arrangements
between two States parties, cannot contradict the definition of the ICSID
Convention. In other words, they can confirm the ICSID notion or restrict it, but
they cannot expand it in order to have access to ICSID. A definition included in a
BIT being based on a test agreed between two States cannot set aside the definition
of the ICSID Convention, which is a multilateral agreement. As long as it fits within
the ICSID notion, the BIT definition is acceptable, it is not if it falls outside of such
definition. For example, if a BIT would provide that ICSID arbitration is available
for sales contracts which do not imply any investment, such a provision could not
be enforced by an ICSID tribunal.”>

355. Other tribunals have taken the position that it is not so much the term “investment” in
the ICSID Convention as the term “investment” per se that should be considered as
having an objective meaning in itself, whether it is mentioned in the ICSID Convention
or in a BIT. For example, the tribunal in Romak S.A. v. Uzbekistan, conducting its

proceedings on the basis of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, observed as follows:

“The term ‘investment’ has a meaning in itself that cannot be ignored when
considering the list contained in Article 1(2) of the BIT.

[...] The Arbitral Tribunal therefore considers that the term ‘investments’ under the
BIT has an inherent meaning (irrespective of whether the investor resorts to ICSID
or UNCITRAL arbitral proceedings) entailing a contribution that extends over a
certain period of time and that involves some risk [...]. By their nature, asset types
enumerated in the BIT’s non-exhaustive list may exhibit these hallmarks. But if an
asset does not correspond to the inherent definition of “investment,” the fact that it
falls within one of the categories listed in Article I does not transform it into an
‘investment.’ In the general formulation of the tribunal in Azinian, ‘labeling ... is no
substitute for analysis.””>°!

356. In sum, the aforementioned tribunals seem to have developed an understanding to the

effect that some core elements characterize an investment, whether these are

108

considered as a general framework or as jurisdictional requirements. According to such
test, an investment requires a contribution of money or assets, duration and risk, which

elements form part of the objective definition of the term “investment.”

357. On the other hand, insofar as BIT arbitration under the ICSID Convention is concerned,
it has also been held in a number of well-known cases that, because the ICSID
Convention provides no definition of the term “investment,” the limits of this concept
are susceptible to agreement between the State parties to a BIT, and that the definition
of investment in a BIT providing for arbitration under the auspices of ICSID supplies
the definition missing from the Washington Convention. Such definitions have been
described as following a “subjective” approach adopted by such States in the
instruments (whether BITs or national legislation) which embody their consent to
ICSID jurisdiction. As stated by the tribunal in the CSOB case, under this approach, the
consent of the State parties as to what constitutes an investment is of primary

importance:

“[I]nvestment as a concept should be interpreted broadly because the drafters of
the Convention did not impose any restrictions on its meaning. Support for a liberal
interpretation of the question whether a particular transaction constitutes an
investment is also found in the first paragraph of the Preamble to the Convention,
which declares that ‘the Contracting States [are] considering the need for
international cooperation for economic development, and the role of private
international investment therein.’

[ou]

It follows that an important element in determining whether a dispute qualifies as
an investment under the Convention in any given case is the specific consent given
by the Parties. The Parties’ acceptance of the Centre’s jurisdiction with respect to
the rights and obligations arising out of their agreement therefore creates a strong
presumption that they considered their transaction to be an investment within the
meaning of the ICSID Convention.”>°?

358. Others have been more blunt. In Malaysian Historical Salvors v. Malaysia, the ad hoc

Committee observed that:

5°2 CSOB v. Slovakia, 1 64-66.

109

“It is those bilateral and multilateral treaties which today are the engine of ICSID’s
effective jurisdiction. To ignore or depreciate the importance of the jurisdiction
they bestow upon ICSID, and rather to embroider upon questionable interpretations
of the term “investment” as found in Article 25(1) of the Convention, risks crippling
the institution.”>°
359. Given the Tribunal’s conclusion that the definition of investment in the BIT at issue in
this case does not extend to PoStova banka’s GGBs, this is a controversy that this
Tribunal does not need to resolve. The Tribunal has considered both approaches, but
does not need to choose between the “objective” approach, which would give the term

“investment” an inherent meaning, and a “subjective” approach based on the will of

State parties, as expressed in the BIT.

b. If an Objective Approach were applied, a Majority of the Tribunal Would
Find That Claimants Do Not Have an Investment Under the Washington
Convention**

360. The Tribunal, by majority, believes that an analysis applying the “objective” test, as
pleaded by the Parties, would lead to the same conclusion with respect to PoStova
banka GGBs as the Tribunal reached in its analysis of the “subjective” test under the
BIT. The members of the Tribunal who conclude that, if the Tribunal were to analyse
the GGB interests in light of the “objective” test — contribution, duration, risk — the
Claimants would not have an investment under the ICSID Convention, would place

particular emphasis on the following circumstances.

361.

If an “objective” test is applied, in the absence of a contribution to an economic

venture, there could be no investment. An investment, in the economic sense, is linked

5

with a process of creation of value,°°> which distinguishes it clearly from a sale,*°°

which is a process of exchange of values or a subscription to sovereign bonds which is

503 MHS Annulment, 73.
5% Arbitrator Townsend does not agree with the reasoning or the conclusions stated in this section and
therefore does not join in this portion (Section VI.2.b) of the Award.

55 To be entirely accurate, it should be said “a process of purported creation of value,” in order to take into
account failed investments which must still be considered investments.

 

506 In a sale there is also a contribution of goods or services by the seller and a contribution of money by the
buyer, but this is different from the contribution to an economic venture required in order to find an
investment.

110

also a process of exchange of values i.e. a process of providing money for a given
amount of money in return. If the idea that the contribution, as an element of
investment, has to be involved in an economic operation creating value is accepted,

would this be the situation considering the concrete facts of the case?

362. A State is not primarily an economic actor engaged in economic ventures in the sense
just developed. The State enters into numerous sales contracts to run its different
administrations, it pays its civil servants, it ensures the functioning of its embassies,
refinances part of its foreign debt (which could imply that the sums raised are not used
in the territory of Greece, and possibly do not even pass through Greece’s territory, but
are sent to the different financial places where Greece had debts, possibly through

compensation schemes) and so on.

363. The Claimants have not argued that the money PoStova banka paid for the GGB
interests, even if considered as ultimately benefitting Greece, was used in economically
productive activities. Rather, it appears that the funds were used for Greece’s budgetary
needs, and particularly for repaying its debts, as acknowledged both in the written

submissions and at the Hearing:

“Greece's ability to raise these funds from investors was critical to its funding of its
government budget, particularly as it was discovered years after the fact that Greek
officials had underreported the country’s budget deficit when applying for entry
into the Eurozone in 2001.”°°"

“Greece heavily relied on the capital raised by its bond offerings to_fund_its
government budget.”°°*

Greece took the funds raised through its issuance and it used it to fund more debt
and it used it to fund its other budgetary obligations.”

364. For the purposes of ascertaining jurisdiction, prior decisions have distinguished

between sovereign bonds that are used for general funding purposes and those used for

507 C-Mem., 4. (Emphas
508 C-Mem., J 30. (Emphasis added).
5 Hearing, Tr., 116:6-8. (Emphasis added).

 

111

public works or services. Michael Waibel referred to two mixed commission cases in

the following terms:

“(...) Two mixed-commission cases dealing with sovereign bonds do suggest,
however, a distinction between physical and intangible assets; jurisdiction was
found only for those sovereign bonds used for public works or services rendered to
the government, as opposed to those issued for general budgetary purposes of the
issuing country. In Companie Générale des Eaux de Caracas, the commission
accepted jurisdiction over Venezuelan bearer bonds, issued to the Belgian claimant
CGE, to finance public works. The direct link between bonds issued as payment for
property transferred and services rendered to the government overcame the
presumption of no jurisdiction. In Boccardo, the commission accepted jurisdiction
where the claimant had received bonds in exchange for merchandise furnished.”>'

 

365. The same approach has been adopted by ICSID tribunals, in Fedax v. Venezuela, where
promissory notes were considered as investments because they were issued by the
Republic of Venezuela in connection with a contract for the provision of services, in
CSOB v. Slovakia, where a loan was considered as an investment, only because it was
part of an overall economic operation of restructuring of CSOB and development of the
bank. And in cases where the financial instruments were not linked with an economic
venture, ICSID tribunals have not considered them as investments on their own, like
for example in Joy Mining v. Egypt, where a bank guarantee which was not linked with
a contract that could qualify as an investment was not considered as an investment, or
in Alps Finance v. Slovak Republic, where the tribunal decided that, because the
underlying contract having given rise to some receivables was not an investment, the

receivables themselves could not be considered as investments.

366. As far as the element of duration is concerned, the Tribunal has been convinced by the
evidence in the proceedings that such element is present in the GGBs acquired by

PoStova banka.

367. Under an “objective” test, the element of risk is essential and cannot be analysed in

isolation. Indeed any economic transaction — it could even be said any human activity —

510 RL-27: Michael Waibel, Opening Pandora's Box: Sovereign Bonds In International Arbitration,
American Journal of International Law (2007), Vol. 101, p. 711, pp.743-744.

entails some element of risk. Risk is inherent in life and cannot per se qualify what is

an investment.

368. The investment risk, for purposes of the application of an “objective” test, was defined

by the Romak tribunal as follows:

“All economic activity entails a certain degree of risk. As such, all contracts —
including contracts that do not constitute an investment — carry the risk of non-
performance. However, this kind of risk is pure commercial, counterparty risk, or,
otherwise stated, the risk of doing business generally. It is therefore not an element
that is useful for the purpose of distinguishing between an investment and a
commercial transaction.

An ‘investment risk’ entails a different kind of alea, a situation in which the
investor cannot be sure of a return on his investment, and may not know the amount
he will end up spending, even if all relevant counterparties discharge their
contractual obligations. Where there is ‘risk’ of this sort, the investor simply cannot
predict the outcome of the transaction.”>"!

369. In other words, under an “objective” approach, an investment risk would be an
operational risk and not a commercial risk or a sovereign risk. A commercial risk
covers, inter alia, the risk that one of the parties might default on its obligation, which
risk exists in any economic relationship. A sovereign risk includes the risk of
interference of the Government in a contract or any other relationship, which risk is not

specific to public bonds.

370. Under the objective approach, commercial and sovereign risks are distinct from
operational risk. The distinction here would be between a risk inherent in the
investment operation in its surrounding — meaning that the profits are not ascertained
but depend on the success or failure of the economic venture concerned — and all the
other commercial and sovereign risks. This distinction has been underscored by

Emmanuel Gaillard:

“Trois éléments sont donc requis: l’apport, la durée et le fait que l’investisseur
supporte, au moins en partie, les aléas de l’entreprise [...] Dans une telle

511 Romak v. Uzbekistan, WM 229-230.

113

conception, un simple prét dont la rémunération ne dépend en rien du succes de
lVentreprise ne peut étre qualifié d’investissement.”>'?

371. In sum, if “objective” criteria were to be applied, while it could be accepted that there
was an intended duration of the possession by PoStova banka of the GGB interests, the
element of contribution to an economic venture and the existence of the specific
operational risk that characterizes an investment under the objective approach are not
present here. In other words, under the objective approach of the definition of what
constitutes an investment, i.e. a contribution to an economic venture of a certain
duration implying an operational risk, the acquisition by PoStova banka of the interests
in GGBs would not constitute an investment, and as a consequence, if that criteria were

applied, the Tribunal could not assert jurisdiction.

Vil. COSTS

372. Both Parties request an award of costs in respect of their legal fees and expenses and

the costs of arbitration incurred in connection with this proceeding.

373. Claimants’ legal fees and expenses amount to US$5,517,010.09 as of September 30,
2014.°! Claimants have advanced US$300,000 on account of the fees and expenses of
the Members of the Tribunal and the ICSID administrative fees and expenses, as well

as a lodging fee of US$25,000.

374. Respondent’s legal fees and expenses amount to €4,650,232.73 as of September 30,
2014.5!4 Respondent has advanced US$300,000 to ICSID to cover costs of the

arbitration.

375. The fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID’s administrative fees and expenses

(the costs of arbitration), including expenses relating to the Hearing, amount to

376. Rule 47(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides that the Tribunal’s Award “shall
contain [...] (j) any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.”
Article 61 of the ICSID Convention gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate costs of
the arbitration, including attorney’s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it

deems appropriate.

377. Although the Tribunal has concluded that it lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae and
ruled in favor of Respondent, the jurisdictional issue was not clear-cut and involved a
complex factual and legal background. Each side presented valid arguments in support

of its respective case and acted fairly and professionally.

378. In light of these circumstances, the Tribunal decides that both sides shall bear the costs

of arbitration equally, and that each side shall bear its own legal and other costs.

VIII. DECISION

379. For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:
i. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the dispute;
ii. The Parties shall bear the costs of the arbitration in equal shares;
iii. | Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and expenses;

iv. _ All other claims are dismissed.

515 The ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement of the case account as
soon as all invoices are received and the account is final.

516 Any remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced
to ICSID.
