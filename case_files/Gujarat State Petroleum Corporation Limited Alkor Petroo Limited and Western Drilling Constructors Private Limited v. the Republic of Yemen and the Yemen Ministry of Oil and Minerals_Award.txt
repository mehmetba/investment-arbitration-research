SUMMARY OF THE MAIN FACTS

The following summary gives an overview of the present dispute. It does not
include all facts which may be of relevance, particularly as they emerged from
the extensive evidence gathered at the hearings. Where necessary, the relevant
factual aspects will be discussed in the context of the Tribunal’s analysis of the
disputed issues.

1. The Claimants’ investment in Yemen

As mentioned above, the Claimants are all companies engaged in petroleum
exploration and production. In 2006, they decided to engage in hydrocarbon
activities in Yemen, particularly in the Third International Bid Round.

The Claimants submitted bids for three blocks 19, 57 and 28 (“the Blocks”). On
9 December 2006, the Blocks were awarded to them. Two years later, on 13
April 2008, the Ministry of Oil and Minerals (referred to in the PSAs as "Ministry"
or "MINISTRY"), on the one hand, and GSPC, Alkor, WDCPL, and the Yemen

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 12 of 128

General Corporation for Oil and Gas," collectively constituting the "Contractor"

on the other hand, entered into three almost identical Production Sharing
Agreements (“PSAs”) for the Blocks.* Almost a year later, on 17 March 2009,
the PSAs were ratified by the President of Yemen. The PSAs are governed by
Yemeni law, and are also themselves laws of Yemen.*

14. The PSAs divided the exploration and production activities to be conducted
thereunder into an Exploration Period, which, in case of a commercial discovery
of oil, was to be followed by a Development Period. The Exploration Period was
itself divided into a First Exploration Period of four years, and, at the election of
the Contractor, a Second Exploration Period of two years. Only the First
Exploration Period is relevant for the present dispute. This period commenced
on 17 March 2009, the date on which the PSAs came into effect.>

2. The PSA terms

15. The PSAs are identical except for their commercial terms and their respective
Work Program and Budget. Pursuant to their provisions, the Claimants were to
carry out reprocessing and interpreting existing seismic data; acquiring,
processing and interpreting new 2D and 3D seismic data; and drilling work in
Yemen during the First Exploration Period. Their obligations have been

summarized as under:®

‘ The Corporation, wholly-owned by the Republic of Yemen and controlled by the Ministry, is a
mandatory partner. As it is a “formal” partner, it does not participate in the present dispute. RfA, §11.

? Unless the context ise requires, the ital terms and iatic used in this Award
are those stipulated in the PSAs.

* Exh. C-1 (PSA Block 19); Exh. C-2 (PSA Block 28); Exh. C-3 (PSA Block 57).

* Laws No. 6, No.7 and No. 9 of 2009 (Exhs. R-1-3).

16. Pursuant to the PSAs, the Claimants undertook a Minimum Work Obligation (or
“MWO”) supported by a Minimum Expenditure Obligation. This Minimum
Expenditure Obligation was guaranteed by irrevocable Standby Letters of Credit
("SBLCs") in the total amount of US$ 42 million issued by the International Bank
of Yemen (“IBY”) in favor of Respondent 2. The SBLCs were accompanied by a
chain of corresponding counter-guarantees:” the SBLCs themselves were
backed by counter-guarantees issued by Dresdner Bank (now Commerzbank
AG, Germany (“Commerzbank’)), which in turn received counter-guarantees
from IDBI Bank Limited, India (“IDBI”). The counter-guarantees by IDB] were
secured by back-to-back guarantees issued by the Claimants.

17. In practice, the cost of performing the Minimum Work Obligation would likely

exceed the Minimum Expenditure Obligation.® Consequently, in order to assess

the real cost of the work, Article 4.3 of the PSAs provided that the Claimants
were to produce an annual Work Program and Budget (“WP&B”) for approval by

7 For the sake of convenience, the Tribunal uses the generic term “guarantees’, which should not be
construed as a determination of the nature of the relationship between the concerned entities. The
Tribunal also recalls that the “guarantees” between the IBY and the Respondents were in the form of
SBLCs.

the Ministry. Once approved, a WP&B could not be substantially revised or
modified without the Ministry's approval.°

On 17 September 2009, the Claimants submitted their first WP&B indicating
their planned work and expenditure for the remaining period of 2009 and for
2010. The technical arm of the Ministry, the Petroleum Exploration and
Production Authority (‘PEPA”),'° approved that WP&B (amounting to US$ 35.5
million) in May 2010.'* In November 2010, the Claimants submitted their second
WP8B for 2011 amounting to US$ 53.04 million. Finally, on 24 January 2012,
the Claimants submitted the WB&P for 2012 but only for Blocks 19 and 28
amounting to US$ 40.29 million. The last two WP&Bs were not approved by the
Respondents, although they contend that they would have been approved in
substantially the form submitted.

On 3 September 2010, the Claimants appointed Fugro Robertson Limited
(‘Fugro”), a specialized external service provider to analyze the existing data
and to conduct a “Prospectivity Review” of the Blocks. On 24 March 2011, the
Claimants received the results of Fugro’s analysis (“the Fugro Reports”).

The Claimants contend that they encountered several obstacles in the
performance of their obligations under the PSAs: relevant data was not
provided to them by the Respondents, landmines existed in Block 19, and the
coordinates of Block 19 were incorrect. All of these are contested by the
Respondents. To the extent necessary to resolve the issues in dispute, these
matters are addressed in the analysis below.

Declaration of Force Majeure and Termination of the PSAs

From January 2011, the security situation in Yemen seems to have begun to
deteriorate. A number of events took place the occurrence of which has not
been disputed: issuance of travel advisories by a number of governments, tribal
clashes, attacks, kidnappings etc. On 18 March 2011, the Government declared
a State of Emergency. On 23 March 2011, the Yemeni House of

° Article 4.3 of the PSAs (‘the Contractor shall not substantially revise or modify the Work Program
and Budget without the approval of the Ministry’).

‘© PEPA acts as agent of Respondent 2. See WS Al Humaidy | §§12-15.
"WS Al Humaidy | §§12-15.
” SoD §§33, 35.

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 15 of 128

Representatives approved the State of Emergency, which lasted for 41 days.
Various other events took place; these are discussed below where relevant.
According to the Claimants, these events fell within the definition of Force
Majeure events contained in Article 22.2 of the PSAs:

“Force Majeure’, within the meaning of this Agreement, shall be any
order, regulation or direction of the GOVERNMENT, or (with respect to the
CONTRACTOR) of the government of the country in which any of the
entities comprising the CONTRACTOR is_ incorporated, whether
promulgated in the form of law or otherwise, or any acts of God,
insurrection, riot, war, strike (or other labor disturbances), fires, floods or
any cause not due to the fault or the negligence of the Party invoking
Force Majeure, whether or not similar to the foregoing, provided that any
such cause is beyond the reasonable control of the party invoking Force
Majeure.”

On 10 April 2011, the Claimants sent a Force Majeure notice to the
Respondents under Article 22.1 of the PSA. It is the Claimants' case that by
their declaration of Force Majeure, the SBLCs were automatically suspended by
virtue of their terms:

"5, Suspension:
During the Force Majeure the Letter of Credit shall be suspended and
continue in force thereafter during such period of Force Majeure.

If the Force Majeure event continues for a period of six (6) Months and the
CONTRACTOR terminates its obligations in accordance with the
PRODUCTION SHARING AGREEMENT this Letter of Credit shall
automatically be cancelled according to its terms.

We hereby guarantee the payment of all amounts not having been
reduced in accordance with the above within ten (10) Days of receipt by
us of your written notice, without further juridical procedures."

The Claimants’ notice was denied by the Respondents on 13 April 2011.
Through subsequent correspondence and meetings, the Parties reiterated their
positions. In May 2012, representatives of the Claimants discussed the issue
with the Minister of Oil and Minerals. According to the Claimants, at the
meeting, the Minister advised them that they would be allowed to exit the Blocks
if they could show that the Blocks had no prospectivity. Since the Minister was
subsequently removed from his office, the Claimants’ contend that this
“negotiated solution” did not work out.

On 4 February 2013, another meeting took place between the Claimants and
PEPA. The Claimants were purportedly informed that if they did not submit the
WP&Bs for 2013 for the Blocks by 15 February 2013, the SBLCs would be
invoked.

On 13 February 2013, the Claimants terminated the PSAs purportedly under
Article 22.4 of the PSAs:

"If the Force Majeure event occurs during either the First Exploration
Period or the Second Exploration Period or any extension(s) thereof and
continues in effect for a period of six (6) Months, thereafter the
CONTRACTOR shall have the option upon ninety (90) Days' prior written
notice to the MINISTRY to terminate its obligations hereunder without
further liability of any kind except for those payments accrued under this
Agreement."

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND RELIEF REQUESTED

THE CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

The Claimants’ arguments in so far as they are relevant and necessary to
resolve the issues in dispute have been reproduced prior to the Tribunal’s
analysis of each disputed issue. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal emphasizes
that it has not provided a summary of each and every specific objection raised
by the Claimants in their submissions, as it would be both repetitive and
unnecessary. The Tribunal has reproduced only what it views as the most
important arguments for its decision. Even if not explicitly reproduced, it goes
without saying that the Tribunal has considered all of the Claimants’ arguments.

Claimants’ earlier submissions. *

THE RESPONDENTS’ POSITION

The Respondents’ arguments in so far as they are relevant and necessary to
resolve the issues in dispute have been reproduced prior to the Tribunal’s
analysis of each disputed issue. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal emphasizes
that it has not provided a summary of each and every specific objection raised
by the Respondents in their submissions, as it would be both repetitive and
unnecessary. The Tribunal has reproduced only what it views as the most
important arguments for its decision. Even if not explicitly reproduced, it goes
without saying that the Tribunal has considered all of the Respondents’

arguments.

THE RESPONDENTS’ REQUEST FOR RELIEF

On 8 October 2014, the Respondents submitted their “Reply to the Claimants’
Submission dated 26 September 2014”, “set[ting] out [...] their claims for
damages as the Respondents would like them to appear in the decision part of
the award”. The Respondents sought the following relief:

“Relief Sought

2. The Respondents seek the following orders:

a) The Respondents are entitled to draw down on the SBLCs for
US$42million, pursuant to Article 2.1.4(b); and;

b) The Respondents are additionally entitled to damages for the
Claimants’ breach of the Minimum Work Obligation, which are to be
assessed as the cost of performance of the work, namely [insert figure];
and/or

c) The Respondents are additionally entitled to damages for the
Claimants’ breach of obligation to perform the 2011 WP&Bs, which are to
be assessed as [insert figure].

3. The Respondents’ primary case is that the figures to be inserted in (b)
and (c) should reflect the cost of performance now of the work, because
this reflects their actual loss. This means that the figure in (b) should be at

"4 SoC §325.

20

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 24 of 128

least US$147m (covering all of the Exploration Work). The figure in (c)
should be US$133m (covering acquisition of the required 2D and 3D
data). Alternatively, the figures should both be at least US$49.47m, as the
2011 WP&B figure for acquiring the new seismic data.

4. The Respondents recognise that they are not entitled to recover more
than the largest of (a) to (c) above. Thus, as and when they succeed in
drawing down on the SBLCs, the sums due for other heads of damages
will reduce commensurately.

5. In the alternative to the claims set out in paragraph 2, if the Tribunal
were to hold that Force Majeure intervened from 11 March 2011, then the
Respondents seek an Award which states that the Claimants were in
breach of the PSAs by failing to perform the work set out in the 2010
WP&Bs. It would follow that the Claimants are liable to pay the
Respondents the cost of performing the 2010 WP&Bs. The claim is for
US$111million (at today’s costs of acquiring new 2D seismic data) or
US$32.46m (the actual amount of the 2010 WP&Bs, net of paid bonuses
and taxes).”

49. In their post-hearing brief, the Respondents sought the following relief:

“223. Accordingly, the Tribunal is asked to:

223.1.Reject the Claimants’ claim;

223.2.Hold that the Respondents are entitled to drawdown on the SBLCs
forthwith;

223.3.Hold that the Claimants were and are in breach of the PSAs by their
failure to perform the Minimum Work Obligation and/or the WP&Bs;
223.4.Award the Respondents damages of US$147m (or such other sum
as the Tribunal may see fit, and inclusive of interest / damages reflecting
the date of performance as the Tribunal may see fit);

223.5.Direct that the Claimants pay the costs of the arbitration and the
Respondents’ costs.”

50. This request for relief included requests for relief made in the Respondents’

earlier submissions.

lll. ANALYSIS

A. PRELIMINARY MATTERS

51. Prior to entering into a discussion on the merits of the Parties’ positions, the
Tribunal will address certain preliminary issues (III.A.1), the Parties to the PSAs

(II.A.2), the interpretation of the PSAs (III.A.3) and some evidentiary matters
(IILA.4-5).

21

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 25 of 128

1. Preliminary Issues

a. Arbitration Agreement

52. It is not disputed that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is based on Article 23 of the
PSAs which provides as follows:

“23.1 Except to those matters which are expressly agreed hereunder to
be settled by an expert, in case a dispute arises under this
Agreement between the MINISTRY and the CONTRACTOR with
respect to interpretation, application or its validity, the Parties to
the dispute shall use their good faith efforts to settle their
differences by mutual agreement. Otherwise, the said Parties
shall submit their dispute to arbitration as provided in this Article
(23).

23.2 Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties to the dispute, the
arbitration shall be held in Paris, France, and conducted in the
English language in accordance with the Rules of Conciliation
and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the
“Rules’). In the event of no specific provisions being provided
under the Rules, the arbitration tribunal shall establish their own
procedure.

23.3 The arbitration shall be initiated by either Party to the dispute
(‘First Party”) giving written notice to the other Party to the
dispute (“Second Party’) that it elects to refer the dispute to
arbitration and has appointed an arbitrator who shall be identified
in said notice. The Second Party shall notify First Party in writing
within forty-five (45) Days identifying the arbitrator that has been
selected and appointed by such Party.

23.4 If the Second Party does not so appoint its arbitrator, the First
Party shall have the right to apply to the Court of Arbitration of
the International Chamber of Commerce to appoint a second
arbitrator. The two (2) arbitrators shall, within thirty (30) Days,
select a third arbitrator failing, which the third arbitrator shall be
appointed by the Court of Arbitration of the International
Chamber of Commerce at the request of either the First Party or
the Second Party.

23.5 The third arbitrator shall not be a citizen of the ROY or of a
country in which any of the entities comprising the
CONTRACTOR is incorporated, but shall be a citizen of a
country which has diplomatic relations with the aforesaid
countries, and shall not have any economic interest in the oil
business of the ROY or of any party to the dispute.

23.6 The Parties hereto shall extend to the arbitration tribunal all
facilities (including access to the Petroleum Operations) for
obtaining any information required for the proper determination of
the dispute. The absence or default of any Party to the arbitration

22

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 26 of 128

shall not be permitted to prevent or hinder the arbitration
proceeding in any or all of its stages.

23.7 Pending the decision or award of the arbitration tribunal, the
Petroleum Operations or activities which have given rise to the
arbitration need not be discontinued. In the event the decision or
award recognizes that the complaint was justified, provisions
may be made therein for such reparation as may be
appropriately made in favor of the complainant.

23.8 Judgment the award rendered may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for a
judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement, as
the case may be.

23.9 The provisions of this Agreement relating to arbitration shall
continue in force notwithstanding the expiration or termination of
this Agreement.

23.10 The Parties hereto base their relationship under this Agreement
on the principles of goodwill and good faith. The interpretation
and application of the provisions of this Agreement with respect
to the Arbitration shall be in accordance with the Yemeni laws
that are outlined in Article 24 of the Agreement."

The Respondents’ argument that Respondent 1 is not a party to the PSAs (and

consequently that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Respondent 1) is
considered below [section III.A.2].

b. Place of Arbitration

In accordance with Article 23.2 of the PSAs, the place of the arbitration is Paris,
France.

c. Applicable Law

Article 23.10 of the PSAs provides in relevant part that:

“The interpretation and application of the provisions of this Agreement with
respect to the Arbitration shall be in accordance with the Yemeni laws that
are outlined in Article 24 of the Agreement.”

Article 24 of the PSAs, in turn, provides that:

“This Agreement, its Annexes, and any modification, will be governed and
interpreted according to Yemeni laws, except the laws which are
inconsistent with this Agreement.”

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 27 of 128

In sum, the law applicable in this proceeding is the law of the Republic of
Yemen, "except the laws which are inconsistent with (the PSAs)". As already
indicated, the PSAs are themselves laws of Yemen.

d. Applicable Procedural Rules

Article 23.2 of the PSAs provides in relevant part that:
“Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties to the dispute, the arbitration
shall be held in Paris, France, and conducted in the English language in
accordance with the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce (the “Rules”). In the event of no
specific provisions being provided under the Rules, the arbitration tribunal
shall establish their own procedure.”
Thus, on the basis of the Parties’ agreement, this arbitration is governed by the
ICC Rules of Arbitration of 2012 (‘the ICC Rules”) and the Procedural Rules
issued by the Tribunal. If none of the above addresses a specific procedural
issue, the issue shall be determined by agreement between the Parties or, in
the absence of such agreement, by the Tribunal. Further, in accordance with
paragraph 44 of the Procedural Rules of 20 September 2013, the IBA Rules on
the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (2010) (“the IBA Rules”) shall
serve as a guide to the Parties and the Tribunal but will not bind the Tribunal.

2. Parties to the PSAs
a. The Respondents’ position

According to the Respondents, no claim lies against Respondent 1, which is not
even a contracting Party to the PSAs. They point out that Yemeni law is to be
applied to determine who is a Party to the PSAs, not French law or international
arbitration doctrine. Under Yemeni law, the Ministry is a separate legal entity
from the State. For instance, under Article 2 of Decree No. 40 of 2000, the
Ministry has delegated authority to enter into PSAs, which indicates that it can
act independently of the Republic of Yemen, and enter into contracts itself. This
position is reinforced by the Preamble and other provisions of the PSAs.

63.

64.

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 28 of 128

Further, on their face, the PSAs are contracts between Respondent 2, i.e. the
Ministry, and the Claimants.

The Respondents also submit that the Claimants’ submissions are misguided.
If, as the Claimants contend, the Ministry contracted as agent for the Republic
of Yemen, then it would follow that only the Republic of Yemen (i.e. Respondent
1) is a party to the PSAs, not that both the Republic and the Ministry are parties.

b. The Claimants’ position

The Claimants dispute the Respondents’ submissions, and insist that
Respondent 1 is a party to the PSAs. They submit that the question of whether
the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Respondent 1 is governed by French law. On
several occasions, the Cour de cassation (and other international tribunals),
have found that where an arbitration agreement is entered into by a state organ,
the state is bound by the agreement. They invite the Tribunal to reach the same
conclusion in the present case.

The Claimants submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Respondent 1 for
principally two reasons. First, relying on provisions of the Yemeni Constitution
and general Yemeni law, they contend that both Respondents are effectively
the same. The only authority cited by the Respondent — Decree No. 40 — does
not say that the Ministry has separate legal personality. It says exactly the
opposite — that the Ministry has no separate legal personality; and that itis a
mere organ/sub-department of the Republic. Thus, the Republic, just like the
Ministry, is bound by contracts (such as the PSAs) concluded by the Ministry.
Second, the Claimants contend that even if the Respondents were considered
two distinct legal persons, the Tribunal would still have jurisdiction over
Respondent 1 because the Ministry entered into the PSAs both in its own name
and in the name of the Republic.'® According to the Claimants, “Respondent 2
is merely an organ of the state and acted also for and on behalf of Respondent
1 when it entered into the PSAs and the arbitration agreements.”"° In support,
they point to “numerous references” to Respondent 2 representing Respondent
14 for the purposes of the PSAs. They also contend that as Yemen’s natural

67.

68.

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 29 of 128

resources belong to the State, the Ministry could not grant rights under the
PSAs without acting as a representative of Respondent 1 and binding
Respondent 1. In sum, the Claimants contend that Respondent 1 could not
have granted rights under the PSAs if it was not party to them.

The Claimants further contend that it is not correct for the Respondents to rely
on the fact that on their face the PSAs say that they are concluded with
Respondent 2. After all, the PSAs also say that they relate to the “Republic of
Yemen”. Further, it is also not correct for the Respondents to say that Decree
No. 40 states that the Ministry would be the sole contracting party. The Decree
does not say any such thing, and should, in fact, be interpreted to reach the
opposite conclusion.

Finally, the Claimants disagree that if the Ministry acted as agent for the
Republic, then only the Republic should be a party to the PSAs and the
arbitration agreements, not both the Ministry and the Republic. According to the
Claimants, provisions of the PSAs and arbitral case law all stand for the
proposition that an entity can act simultaneously in its own interest and as an
agent of governmental authorities.”

c. Analysis

The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is based on Article 23 of the PSAs which
provides in relevant part:

23.1 Except to those matters which are expressly agreed hereunder to be
settled by an expert, in case a dispute arises under this Agreement
between the MINISTRY and the CONTRACTOR with respect to
interpretation, application or its validity, the Parties to the dispute shall use
their good faith efforts to settle their differences by mutual agreement.
Otherwise, the said Parties shall submit their dispute to arbitration as
provided in this Article (23).

23.2 Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties to the dispute, the
arbitration shall be held in Paris, France [...].”
The difference between the Parties lies in the law applicable to determine the
parties to the PSAs. The Respondents insist that Yemeni law should apply,
while the Claimants insist that French law is applicable.

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 30 of 128

If — as the Respondents insist - Yemeni law is to apply, then the Tribunal notes

that the Ministry of Oil and Minerals (Respondent 2) and the Republic of Yemen

(Respondent 1) are effectively the same. Under Yemeni law, the Ministry forms

a part of the Republic of Yemen:

Article 129 of the Yemeni Constitution’® states that the Council of
Ministers together forms the government of Respondent 1:
“The Council of Ministers is the government of the Republic of
Yemen, and it is the highest executive and administrative
authority of the state. All state administrative organisations,
agencies, corporations, without exception, are under the
directives of the Council of Ministers.”
Article 130 of the Yemeni Constitution declares that the government itself
is composed of the Prime Minister, his deputies and the Ministers:
“The government is composed of the Prime Minister and his
deputies and Ministers who together shall form the Council of
Ministers. The law defines the general basis for organising
ministries and the various bodies of the State.”
The Respondents have not produced any cogent authority supporting
their position that Respondent 2 has an independent legal personality.
The authority relied on by the Respondents — Decree No. 40 of 200 —
does not contain any provision conferring separate legal personality to
Respondent 2."° In fact, the Decree supports the position that the
Ministry functions as a part of Respondent 4.2

In the circumstances, as the Ministry forms a part of the Republic of Yemen,

and as the Respondents have not cogently established how the Ministry has an

independent legal personality such that only the Ministry should be considered

a party to the PSAs, especially in circumstances where the PSAs themselves

19 In their Rej. C.C, the Claimants specifically noted that the Respondents had not identified a
provision in Decree No. 40 that would grant the Ministry separate legal personality. Despite having
the opportunity to do so, the Respondents did not clarify its position on the issue.

20 See, for instance Art. 3 of the Decree which provides that the “Minister shall administer the Ministry
[...] in accordance with the Constitution;” Art. 3(5) of the Decree which provides that the Minister
shall “submit reports [...] to the Cabinet; Art. 3(10) of the Decree which provides that the Minister
shall “issue the laws and rules in connection with the oil and mineral operation [...] and the other
laws with regard to the industrial operation;” Art. 26 of the Decree which provides that the “ministry
and its departments shall [...] channel revenues to the public treasury.”

27

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 31 of 128

confer rights on the Republic of Yemen,’ it follows that the Republic of Yemen
(ie. Respondent 1), is party to the PSAs. In any event, the Tribunal notes that
Article 1.37 of the PSAs provides that the Ministry represents the “State” with
respect to the PSAs.” Further, Article 3.1 of the PSAs provides that the “State”
has granted rights to the Ministry and the Claimants to conduct petroleum
operations.”° Thus, at the very least, the Ministry represents the Republic of
Yemen in respect of the PSAs (which are also to be approved by the Yemeni
Parliament as laws of Yemen**), which the Respondents’ legal expert appears
to agree.” In these circumstances as well, the Republic of Yemen would also
be a party to the PSAs.°

71. \If—as the Claimants insist — French law is to apply, then the Tribunal notes that
pursuant to Articles 23.1 and 23.2 of the PSAs, the Claimants and Respondent
2 have agreed to arbitrate, and have further agreed that the place of arbitration
shall be Paris, France. Nonetheless, the French law on arbitration would not
apply by virtue of this choice only. The parties have to select French law.””

72. In PO 1, the Tribunal noted the Claimants' argument that French law grants the
Tribunal the authority in respect of interim measures. This argument was not
disputed by the Respondents. Further, the Respondents have generally

21 See, for instance Article 21.1. of the PSAs which provides that the “Government” i.e. the Republic of
Yemen has the right to “cancel” the PSAs. See also Article 9.1.1 (a) of the PSAs which provides that
taxes are to the paid to the “ROY” i.e. the Republic of Yemen.

2 article 1.37 of the PSAs provides: “MINISTER” means the Minister of Oil and Minerals ot any other
Minister designated from time to time by the Ministry to represent the STATE with respect to this
Agreement”. Article 1.60 of the PSAs defines “State” as “YEMEN” or “ROY” or “STATE” means the
Republic of Yemen [...]’.

?° Article 3.1 of the PSAs provides: “The STATE hereby grants to the CONTRACTOR” and the
MINISTRY the exclusive right to conduct Petroleum Operations in the Agreement Area subject to
the terms, covenants and conditions set out in this Agreement.”

25 WS Al Maqtari | §21 (“The essence of a PSA is that the State, through the Ministry, grants the
Contractor a potential opp to earn i from oil pi from the Block
L.-J’).

2° In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal is aware of the Respondents’ argument that “if as the
Claimants contend, the Ministry contracted as agent for the Republic of Yemen, then it would follow
that only the Republic of Yemen (i.e. Respondent 1) is a party to the PSAs not that both the
Republic and the Ministry are parties.” The Tribunal is unable to agree. Besides making a general
statement in this respect, the Respondents have not substantiated why this should be the case. By
contrast, the Claimants’ legal expert, Mr. Lugman testified that both the Ministry and the Republic of
Yemen could be parties even in cases where the Ministry represents the Republic of Yemen
(Luqman ER | p.2 et. seq; ER Il p.1-2, ER Ill, q.17).

28

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 32 of 128

recognised French law as the law of this arbitration.2° Both Parties therefore
seem to consider that French law on arbitration has relevance which can be
viewed as a selection of French law.

73. In France, an arbitration agreement is valid if the consent of the parties is
established and if it does not result in a violation of international public policy
(‘ordre public international’). Further, in the general experience of French
Courts, a ministry ordinarily appears to be the same entity as the state.”
Applied to this case, this would mean that if the Ministry has entered into a valid
arbitration agreement, then, unless there are reasons to the contrary, that
agreement will bind the State.

74, Here, the validity of the arbitration agreement in Article 23 of the PSAs has not
been challenged. Further, as above, the Ministry forms a part of the Republic of
Yemen. Thus, as the Ministry has entered into a valid arbitration agreement,
and as the Ministry is a part of the Republic of Yemen, the Tribunal believes
that the arbitration agreement binds the Republic of Yemen. In effect, this
means that the Republic of Yemen is party to the PSAs.

75. In the circumstances, irrespective of whether Yemeni law or French law
applies, the outcome would be the same: the Tribunal finds that the Republic of
Yemen (Respondent 1) is a party to the PSAs.

3. Interpretation of the PSAs

76. Inthe course of the proceeding, the Parties' legal experts agreed that the PSAs
were “special” laws i.e. they constituted Yemeni law as well as contracts,°° a
position with which the Tribunal agrees. The experts also agreed on some of
the principles governing the interpretation of the PSAs. On the basis of the
provisions of the PSAs, the agreement of the Parties’ experts, and its own

analysis, the Tribunal has kept the following points in mind while interpreting the
PSAs:

i, The PSAs are laws of Yemen;*"

ii. |The PSAs are governed by Yemeni law;*”

iii. |The PSAs are meant to be the exclusive source of the Parties' respective
rights and obligations as to their subject-matter;**

iv. The PSAs are to be interpreted and applied in accordance with Yemeni
law;**

v. _ If the wording of a provision in the PSAs is clear, the words must be
given effect.*> In giving effect to the words, the common meaning of the
words as well as the Yemeni law meaning of the words may be
considered;

vi. The PSAs prevail over general principles of law in so far as they make
specific provision for particular matters;°°

vii, Both the Arabic and English versions of the PSAs are to be referred to for
interpretation.*” It follows that if a word has several meanings, then that
meaning which is common between Arabic and English should be
preferred;

viii. If the PSAs are silent on a particular matter, or if the provisions of the
PSAs are unclear, then, for purposes of interpretation, reference may be

general customs." In such circumstances, the principles of good will and

good faith may be used to ascertain the intention of the Parties at the

time they entered into the PSAs.°°

77. On a related matter, the experts initially disagreed on the existence of the

contra proferentem principle of interpretation in Yemen.” This difference was

resolved at the hearing, with the Respondents’ expert Mr. Al Maqtari agreeing

that the rule does exist in Yemen.**

4. Evidence of Witnesses

a. Evidence of witnesses and experts not called to testify at the

hearing

78. The Tribunal notes that the Parties have made submissions on the conclusions

that the Tribunal should draw in respect of the evidence of witnesses that were

not called for examination at the hearing. For instance, in respect of Mr.

Bartholomew's testimony, the Respondents submit that “the Claimants chose

not to cross-examine Mr. Bartholomew because they did not want the Tribunal

to hear his evidence”? and that “adverse inferences are to be drawn.”** Similar

submissions were made in respect of the Claimants’ witnesses Messrs Roy

Chowdhury and Tejinder Pal Singh.
79. The Tribunal recalls that Paragraph 22 of Procedural Order No.1 provides that:

“The facts contained in the written statement of a witness whose
cross-examination is not requested shall not be deemed established
by the sole fact that no cross-examination is requested. Unless the
Tribunal determines that the witness must be heard, it will assess the

%8 Lugman ER II §1.3 relying on Articles 4, 5 and 6 of the Commercial Code.

°° Tr 1036:19-1037:23 ("MS SABBEN CLARE: But you [and Mr. Al Maqtari] also say that if (the PSAs

weight of the written statement taking into account the entire record

and all the relevant circumstances.”
In its decision below, the Tribunal has determined the weight of witness and
expert testimony in light of all the evidence on record, the Parties’ submissions,
and the applicable rules. It does not see any reason to depart from this principle
which the IBA Rules also edict.“*

b. Characterization of Mr. Al Maqtari’s testimony

Another issue that arose in the course of the arbitration was the characterization
of Mr. Al Maqtari’s evidence as witness or expert evidence. The Claimants
submit that “Mr. Al Maqtari is not a neutral expert, but a witness evidently in
Respondents’ camp”.*° By contrast, the Respondents contend that “Mr. Al
Magqtari is a qualified Yemeni lawyer and is indeed proffered by the
Respondents as an expert.”“°

Ordinarily an expert is a person who is independent of the party appointing
him/her. In the course of his examination, Mr. Al Maqtari stated that “| am the
Deputy Minister, which is a state Ministry involved in defending the State, the
interests of the State and the rights of the State.”*” Thus, the Tribunal believes
that he is not an “expert” as is commonly understood. That being said, there is
no applicable rule which obliges the Tribunal to give more (or less) weight to
testimony simply because it emanates from an expert or a witness of fact. In all
circumstances it is for the Tribunal to determine the weight of any evidence, a
principle which is recognised by the IBA Rules as well.“® Thus, Mr. Al Magtari’s
lack of independence from the Respondents is one of the factors that the
Tribunal has borne in mind in weighing his evidence.“*

“4 art. 4.8 of the IBA Rules (‘If the appearance of a witness has not been requested pursuant to Article
8.1, none of the other Parties shall be deemed to have agreed to the correctness of the content of
the witness statement.”)

c. Admissibility of Mr. Bartholomew's Testimony

83. The Tribunal resolved a number of procedural issues as they arose in the
course of the arbitration.®° After the hearing, the Tribunal specifically asked the
Parties to raise any further procedural objections they may have.®" In their
responses, the Parties indicated that they had no procedural objections.© The
Respondents however reiterated their earlier objections in respect of Mr.
Bartholomew's evidence.®* Therefore, for the sake of completeness, the
Tribunal addresses this issue below.

84. The Tribunal recalls that the Claimants objected to certain statements made by
Mr. Bartholomew in his witness statements on the basis that those statements,
“concerning information obtained during [Mr. Bartholomew's] tenure at Control
Risks / as embedded security manager with Schlumberger, Control Risks’
client’, contravened a contractual confidentiality obligation between Mr.
Bartholomew and Control Risks. The Respondents opposed this position, and
contended that there was no breach of confidentiality. According to them, the
applicable confidentiality clause only referred to trade secrets, and no such
secrets were disclosed in Mr. Bartholomew's evidence. They insist that his
evidence must be accepted.

85. Inits ruling of 23 June 2014, the Tribunal observed:

“According to the Tribunal, on the basis of the evidence presently
before it, at this juncture, it would not be appropriate to exclude
evidence on the basis of a contractual confidentiality obligation that is
external to the dispute before the Tribunal, especially when the
evidence in question appears to be relevant. The Tribunal does not
believe it to be correct to exclude the evidence at this stage of the
proceedings. As mentioned above, the Claimants are free to
challenge the evidence in whatever manner they deem fit, whether at
the forthcoming hearing and/or through their post-hearing briefs.
What weight (if any) is to be given to the evidence will be determined

© See, for instance, the Tribunal’s ruling of 23 June 2014 in which it addressed the Claimants’
‘objections concerning certain portions of Mr. Bartholomew's and Mr. Al Humaidy’s evidence.
Needless to say, the Tribunal has kept its earlier rulings in mind in reaching its decisions in this
award.

claims”, an issue which the Tribunal has addressed in the course of its analysis of the Respondents’
counterclaims.

by the Tribunal in light of all the relevant circumstances at a later

stage.”
The Tribunal does not see any reason to alter its ruling of 23 June 2014. No
new circumstances have been relied on by the Respondents that would cause
the Tribunal to reconsider its ruling. It is true that despite having additional
opportunities to call Mr. Bartholomew for examination at the hearing, the
Claimants chose not to do so. Further, it may be that the evidence on record
supports Mr. Bartholomew's testimony - an issue on which the Tribunal
expresses no opinion at present. However, this does not mean that Mr.
Bartholomew's evidence should be accepted as it is. Above [§§79-80], the
Tribunal has established the rules that apply to evaluate the testimony of
witnesses that were not called to testify at the hearing. The same rules would
apply to Mr. Bartholomew; the Tribunal does not see any reason to treat his
evidence any differently.

5. Adverse Inferences from Non-Production of Documents

The Tribunal notes that the Claimants’ “primary” submission is that they do
not need to prove that Force Majeure events occurred for a period of at least
six months between March 2011 and February 2013 “because the Tribunal
should draw adverse inferences from Respondents’ failure to produce all
[responsive] documents.” In the circumstances, the Tribunal believes that it
would be advisable to address this issue at the outset.

a. The Claimants’ position

The Claimants insist that the Tribunal should draw adverse inferences from the
Respondents’ failure to produce all documents responsive to Procedural Order
No. 2 of 31 January 2014 (“PO 2”). Specifically, they request the Tribunal to
draw three adverse inferences: “(1) Terrorist activities occurred in all mentioned
governorates between early 2011 and early 2013 and would have created
significant risks for Claimants; (2) Mutiny, defections and insurrections occurred

in the Yemeni military during the relevant period and decreased Respondents’
ability to protect oil and gas exploration and production activities; (3) Oil and gas
companies and subcontractors were subject of attacks during the relevant
period, which would have created significant risks for Claimants.”© For the
Claimants, these inferences should lead the Tribunal to conclude that “(i) a
Force Majeure event as defined in Art. 22.2 of the PSAs (ii) occurred for more
than six months, even until just before the termination, with regard to all three
Blocks.”*”

The Claimants submit that this is the ideal case in which adverse inferences
should be drawn because all the necessary criteria stipulated in the relevant
legal authorities are met. First, the Claimants themselves have submitted all
accessible evidence in support of their allegations concerning the deterioration
of the security situation from early 2011 until February 2013. Second, unlike the
Respondents, the Claimants do not have access to internal documents and
reports of Respondent 1’s ministries and institutions. Third, the adverse
inferences to be drawn are corroborated by the disclosed evidence.

The Claimants point out that the Respondents’ submission — that national
security considerations prevented production of the relevant documents — was
rejected in PO 2 for lack of proper substantiation. National laws are generally
not sufficient to justify a refusal to disclose relevant and material documents.®?
Further, it is not correct for the Respondents to submit that they are not in
possession of the relevant documents, as Respondent 1 is a party to these
proceedings “and the documents at issue are in the possession of the
Parliament or the ministries, organs/institutions of Respondent 4”,

The Claimants deny the Respondents’ submission that Yemen has an oral
culture. After all, Respondent 1’s Ministry of Defense and Interior Ministry did
not state that no responsive documents exist, they stated that the existing
documents cannot be disclosed. They also deny the Respondents’ submission
that adverse inferences should not be drawn because the Respondents had
produced some documents that were adverse to the Respondents’ interest or

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 39 of 128

because they had produced some documents that dealt with the topic. If the
Respondents' arguments are followed, “document production would become
worthless”.°

Finally, the Claimants submit that Respondent 1 is obliged to produce the
requested documents under PO 2 even if the Tribunal later finds that it has no
jurisdiction over it. PO 2 does not distinguish between the two Respondents
such that certain disclosure obligations are to be met by Respondent 1 and
others by Respondent 2. In any event, Respondent 2 is an organ of Respondent
1 and therefore obliged to involve Respondent 1 to meet Respondent 2’s
production obligation.®2

b. The Respondents’ position

The Respondents contend that the Claimants’ invitation to the Tribunal to draw
adverse inferences from the Respondents’ alleged non-production “is a blatant
and unjustified attempt to avoid discharging the heavy burden of proof the
Claimants otherwise bear.” They point out that they have produced a large
number of documents which were adverse to their interests, and submit that
“[tlhere is no basis whatever for concluding that the Respondents are
deliberately covering up the truth and impeding the Tribunal's investigation of
the facts.”°*

The Respondents object to the Claimants’ reliance on the IBA Rules, pointing
out that the Rules are not part of the ICC Rules. In any event, they submit that
Article 9.5 of the IBA Rules only applies if a party has failed to produce
documents without any explanation. Here, the Respondents had explained that
the documents in question were confidential in nature, and the Ministers were
bound to refuse to produce them under the applicable Yemeni laws. Moreover,
the Respondents point out that issues of national security are never discussed
in an open forum in the Yemeni Parliament and are, instead, subject to secret
sessions.

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 40 of 128

The Respondents further submit that Yemen has an oral culture as a result of
which there are few written reports from Parliamentary or Cabinet sessions.
Matters of security, in particular, are resolved through negotiations and
discussions on the ground. Even where matters of national security are
discussed in the Cabinet, a member of the High Security Commission (which is
the body responsible for overseeing the security in Yemen) usually addresses
Cabinet members orally.

Furthermore, the Respondents submit that they made a “further plea” to the
Parliament and the Head of the Parliament to provide responsive documents.
The documents produced as a result of their enquiry relate to issues that are
irrelevant to this arbitration.

c. Analysis

The Tribunal recalls that in Annex A to Procedural Order No. 2, it ordered
Respondents to produce the following:

“All internal reports, memoranda, analyses, and similar documents as
defined in the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence (hereinafter:
“documents’) (i) prepared for or by the Yemeni Ministry of Interior,
the Yemeni Ministry of Defense or (ii) presented to the Yemeni
Parliament or the President of Yemen, reporting about the security
situation with regard to
1.1 AQAP and other terrorist activities;
1.2 Mutiny, defections, insurrections or other forms of group
disobedience in the Yemeni military and clashes between military
factions;
1.3 Attacks against oi! and gas companies, subcontractors or
other oil or gas-related activities (at least regarding the
Governorates Sana’a, Marib, Al-Jawf, Amran, Hadhramaut, and
Shabwa) between 1 January 2011 and 13 February 2013.”

In doing so, it noted:

“The Tribunal notes that the Respondents have objected to the
request on the basis of national and international security. However,
they have not indicated how all the responsive documents (some of
which are over two years old) would contravene their security
concerns.”

It further stated:

“The Tribunal understands that its decisions may require the
disclosure of documents that may be protected on grounds of

37

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 41 of 128

national and/or international security. Should this be the case, the
Tribunal invites the Respondents to advise the Claimants and the
Tribunal accordingly, describing the documents in question,
specifying the nature and extent of the protection claimed and
indicating how that protection applies to the documents in question.
In consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal will then issue
appropriate directions.”

100. Further, in its communication of 5 March 2014, in response to the Parties’
communications concerning document production by the Respondents, the
Tribunal observed:

“[T]he Tribunal believes it to be sufficient to emphasize that its
decisions on document production should be fully complied with
particularly keeping in mind that the Republic of Yemen is currently a
party to the present arbitration, and that the Respondents’ arguments
concerning national security were dealt with in PO 2. Those
decisions impose a continuing obligation (as and when responsive
documents are made available to one of the Parties, they should be
supplied to the other). In this regard, the Tribunal notes with
satisfaction the Respondents’ awareness that it must comply with its
disclosure obligations pursuant to PO 2, Annex A. No. 1.”

101. As mentioned above, the Tribunal may be guided by the IBA Rules. The
Tribunal agrees with the Respondents that the IBA Rules are not as such part of
the ICC Rules. However, they have gained acceptance in international
arbitration. Arbitral tribunals, whether sitting under the ICC or under other
arbitration rules, widely use them because they represent best practices in the
matters they cover. Article 9.5 of the IBA Rules provides in this regard:

“If a Party fails without satisfactory explanation to produce any
Document requested in a Request to Produce to which it has not
objected in due time or fails to produce any Document ordered to be
produced by the Arbitral Tribunal, the Arbitral Tribunal may infer that
such document would be adverse to the interests of that Party.”

102. The Tribunal believes that Parties to an arbitration have a good faith obligation
to cooperate in procedural matters. In an ICC arbitration such as this, parties
undertake to comply with any order made by the arbitral tribunal. Here, under
the Tribunal’s directions, reports that were to be presented to the Yemeni
Parliament were to be produced. However, despite honestly admitting that

38

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 42 of 128

such reports exist, the Respondents only produced publicly available
summaries of the reports but not the reports themselves. Further, the
Respondents also candidly admitted that their production is incomplete.*” The
reasons cited by the Respondents for doing so — that the documents were
confidential in nature because of security concerns — were expressly dealt with
in PO 2. There, the Tribunal — while noting that the Respondents had not
explained why some responsive documents that were over two years old would
affect national security — nevertheless gave the Respondents an opportunity to
explain their position. The Respondents did not do so. In the circumstances, if it
seems to the Tribunal to be justified to complement otherwise available
evidence in the record, the Tribunal may be prepared to draw appropriate
inferences from the Respondents’ apparent non-production of documents. This
follows Article 9(5) of the IBA Rules, as well as a number of cases in which
tribunals have stated that they would draw inferences from non-production.

103. The Tribunal is aware of the Respondents’ argument that because the
Claimants failed to call evidence from Mr. Farooqui (Claimant 1’s nominated
General Manager), Mr. Ray (Claimant 1’s managing director) or those who were
charged with the matter at the time for Claimants 2 and 3, adverse inferences
should be drawn. Further, the Respondents contend that “the factual witnesses
who were produced by the Claimants had little first-hand knowledge of the
matters in issue.”°?

104. According to the Tribunal, it is for the Parties to present evidence that they
deem sufficient to prove their claims. Each Party bears the burden of proving
the facts relied on in support of its claim or defence. That relevant witnesses

°° Respondents email of 27 February 2014 ("So far and aside from the YLNG report that has been
provided to the Claimants our clients were unable to identify any other documents that were
presented to the Parliament concerning the security issue, but we understand that some of these
sessions may have been sessions that were held in secret and as such no reports from those
session can be disclosed.”).

® Respondents email of 27 February 2014 ("As regards responses from Parliament, the Ministry of
Interior, the Ministry of Defense, etc. with their disclosure the Respondents disclosed letters that
were sent to the various bodies requesting compliance with the Claimants’ disclosure request and
the Tribunal’s order. Our clients and we are working to chase these requests with a view to providing
any further disclosure if such disclosure exists.”) See also Rej. §339 (‘The Respondents’ lawyers
and delegates (i.e. the Committee) have at all times sought to comply with the Tribunal's orders but
have come up against ministerial decisions (founded upon Yemen laws) over which they have no
power.”).

that may have had knowledge of the matters under discussion have not been
presented is a factor that the Tribunal has kept in mind in its overall evaluation
of the evidence on record.

B. TERMINATION OF THE PSAS FOR FORCE MAJEURE

105. Article 22 of the PSAs provides that:

“Article 22
FORCE MAJEURE

22.1 The non-performance or delay in performance by the
MINISTRY or the CONTRACTOR of any obligation under this
Agreement other than the obligation to pay any amounts due
or giving notices shall be excused if, and to the extent that,
such non-performance or delay is caused by Force Majeure.
The period of any such non-performance or delay, together
with such period any may be necessary for the restoration of
any damage done during such delay shall be added to the time
given in this Agreement for the performance of any obligation
dependent thereon and consequently, to the term of this
Agreement, but only if the extension of this Agreement is
relevant to the performance of such obligation.
“Force Majeure” within the meaning of this Agreement, shall be
any order, regulation or direction of the GOVERNMENT, or
(with respect to the CONTRACTOR) of the government of the
country in which any of the entities comprising the
CONTRACTOR is incorporated, whether promulgated in the
form of law or otherwise, or any act(s) of GOD, insurrection,
riot, war, strike (or other labor disturbances), fires, floods or
any cause not due to the fault or negligence of the Party
invoking Force Majeure, whether or not similar to the
foregoing, provided that any such cause is beyond the
reasonable control of the party invoking Force Majeure.

22.3 Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions and except as
may be otherwise provided herein, neither the GOVERNMENT
nor the MINISTRY shall incur any responsibility whatsoever to
the CONTRACTOR for any damages, restrictions or loss
arising in consequence of such cause of Force Majeure.

22.4 If the Force Majeure event occurs during either the First
Exploration Period or the Second Exploration Period or any
extension(s) thereof and continues in effect for a period of six
(6) Months, thereafter the CONTRACTOR shall have the
option upon ninety (90) Days’ prior written notice to the
MINISTRY to terminate its obligations hereunder without

further liability of any kind except for those payments accrued
under this Agreement.”

106. The Claimants case is that they were entitled to terminate the PSAs for Force
Majeure under Article 22.4 of the PSAs. They submit that the prerequisites for
termination are clearly set forth in Art. 22 of the PSAs: “(1) the force majeure
event Article 22.2 of the PSAs for six months (2) non-performance Art. 22.1 and
(3) causation again Art. 22.1.” On their part, the Respondents submit that “in
order to establish Force Majeure, the Claimants would have to show that: “(i)
they would have performed their Minimum Work Obligations but for the alleged
Force Majeure events; (ii) the events relied on were unforeseeable at the time
of contracting; (iii) the events made performance impossible, not just harder; (iv)
the events fall within the contractual definition of Force Majeure; and (v) there
was a continuing state of Force Majeure in the 6 months immediately preceding
the Claimants’ notice of purported termination.””'

107.

In the discussion below, the Tribunal analyses the Parties’ arguments in respect
of Article 22 of the PSAs namely: the definition of Force Majeure ((1) below), the
location and duration of the alleged Force Majeure event(s) ((2)-(3) below), the
causal link between the alleged Force Majeure event(s) and the Claimants’
alleged non-performance ((4) below). It then analyses the Respondents’
submissions concerning the validity of the Claimants’ termination of the PSAs
((5) below).

1. Did Force Majeure event(s) occur?

. The Tribunal recalls that Article 22.2 of the PSAs defines Force Majeure as
follows:

“Force Majeure’, within the meaning of this Agreement, shall be any
order, regulation or direction of the GOVERNMENT, or (with respect
to the CONTRACTOR) of the government of the country in which any
of the entities comprising the CONTRACTOR is incorporated,
whether promulgated in the form of law or otherwise, or any acts of
God, insurrection, riot, war, strike (or other labor disturbances), fires,
floods or any cause not due to the fault or the negligence of the Party
invoking Force Majeure, whether or not similar to the foregoing,

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 45 of 128

provided that any such cause is beyond the reasonable control of the
party invoking Force Majeure.”

109. The Parties agree that this provision sets out certain requirements that should
exist to constitute Force Majeure under the PSAs. Certain so-called “additional
requirements” have been proposed by the Respondents. Accordingly, the
Tribunal first analyses the uncontested requirements ((i)), before proceeding to
analyse the so-called “additional” requirements ((ii)).

(i) Uncontested Requirements

110. It is uncontested that Article 22.2 lists several events as Force Majeure events:
(a) direction of the Government, (b) riot, (c) insurrection, and (d) events “not due
to fault or negligence” which are “beyond reasonable control”. If the Tribunal
finds that any one of these listed events occurred in the parts of Yemen that
would have been relevant for the Claimants’ performance between March 2011
and February 2013, and that that event prevented the Claimants’ performance,
it need not then determine whether the other listed events also occurred and
whether they would have had the same effect. Put differently, if the Tribunal
were to find that “riots” in the sense of Article 22.2 of the PSAs occurred for the
necessary duration at the relevant location and prevented the Claimants’
performance, then the Tribunal need not determine whether other listed events
(‘direction of the Government”, “insurrection” etc.) occurred, and whether they
too would have prevented the Claimants’ performance. The consequence of the
listed events is the same. What is important is the prevention of performance of
obligations. Whether this is because of “riot”, “insurrection” or any other defined
Force Majeure event would not matter. Thus, the analysis of one event in and of
itself would suffice.

. For the reasons mentioned below, the Tribunal believes that a Force Majeure
event (event (d) above, i.e. “not due to fault or negligence” and “beyond
reasonable control”) occurred in the parts of Yemen that would have been
relevant for the Claimants’ performance between March 2011 and February
2013, and that that event prevented the Claimants’ performance. As a result,
the Tribunal need not examine the Parties’ submissions on the other Force

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 46 of 128

Majeure events listed in Article 22.2 of the PSAs.” In the section below, the
Tribunal first reproduces the Parties’ arguments and then explains its reasoning.

i. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit that “the extreme risk of crime and kidnapping (in Sana’a
and most Block regions as well as between Sana’a and the different areas) and
the extreme risk for any kind of transport and logistics activities related to the
Blocks” as well as the unavailability of subcontractors qualify as “any cause” in
the sense of Art. 22.2 of the PSAs.” They note that other international oil
companies justified their extension requests or Force Majeure notices based on
the very same reasons as the Claimants.

According to the Claimants, the defined Force Majeure events in Art. 22.2 of the
PSAs provide guidance to the interpretation of the catch-all clause and clearly
lead to the conclusion that the events covered by the catch all clause do not
have to be similar to the non-exhaustive examples listed in Article 22.2 of the
PSAs. For the Claimants, for an event to fall within the catch-all “any cause”
clause, only two pre-requisites must be satisfied: (i) the event must not be
caused by the fault or the negligence of the party invoking force majeure, and
(ii) the event must lie beyond the reasonable control of such party. According to
them, this understanding is in line with the common international understanding
of Force Majeure and international jurisprudence.” By contrast, the
Respondents have not provided any explanations why the Yemeni law
requirements of unforeseeablity and impossibility should apply.

ii. | The Respondents’ Position
The Respondents submit that “[t]he only issue of law which arises in relation to

these words is whether they are subject to the requirements of unforeseeability
and impossibility [...] Even if the Claimants are correct that specific terms used

in Article 22.4 such as “riot” and “insurrection” are independent of other Yemeni
law concepts (which they are not), the same certainly cannot be said of “any
other causes”.”° They also point out that the Claimants have not submitted a
“focused analysis” consisting of a list of alleged events, the dates when those
events occurred or an explanation of how the events prevented the Claimants’
performance.””

iii, Analysis

415. The Tribunal recalls that Article 22.2 of the PSAs defines Force Majeure to
include a “catch-all” provision as follows:

“Force Majeure’, within the meaning of this Agreement, shall be
forder, riot, war, strike etc.] or any cause not due to the fault or the
negligence of the Party invoking Force Majeure, whether or not
similar to the foregoing, provided that any such cause is beyond the
reasonable control of the party invoking Force Majeure.”

416. The catch-all provision contains only two requirements for an event to be
classified as a “Force Majeure” event for the purposes of the PSAs. First, the
event must not be due to the fault or the negligence of the party claiming Force
Majeure. Second, the event should be beyond the reasonable control of such
party.”® In the present case, the Claimants rely on the unavailability of
subcontractors, “the significant quantitative and qualitative increase in security
events” and specific transport and logistics difficulties.

The Tribunal believes that the security situation deteriorated in the parts of

Yemen that would have been relevant for the Claimants’ performance between

March 2011 and February 2013. In particular, the Tribunal notes that during this
period:

¢ The Republic declared a State of Emergency and, importantly, that was

all around the Republic based inter alia on a state of riots in some cities

* Rej. §302.

TT Rej. §303.

78 Not every event that satisfies these two criteria would justify a termination of the PSAs. Indeed, the
event must have occurred at the relevant place and time, and must have caused non-performance
of the Clail igatic These other requi are i below. For the present
purposes, the Tribunal is only considering whether a Force Majeure event (as defined in the PSAs)
occurred.

chronicling the security situation in Yemen from 2011 to 2013.°° A report
produced by the Respondents’ witness also confirms that the country was close
to civil war in mid-2011.°° None of the events mentioned in these documents
were caused by the fault or negligence of the Claimants, nor were they within
the reasonable control of the Claimants. Indeed, it can hardly be said that social
and tribal unrest, sectarian clashes, crimes, kidnapping and other incidents
affecting peace and security took place because of the Claimants’ lapses. In
fact, the Respondents themselves do not appear to make such a submission.**
Rather, they make two arguments, which are considered below.

First, the Respondents contend that the requirements of unforeseeability and
impossibility should be read into the catch all provision. This argument is
discussed in the course of the Tribunal’s analysis of the “additional
requirements” below [§135 et seq.]. As mentioned there, the Tribunal believes
that Art. 22.2 of the PSAs is clear, setting out all of the requirements of Force
Majeure for the purposes of the PSAs. The provision does not mention
unforeseeability and/or impossibility, and, as a result, there is no reason to add
these requirements into Article 22.2 of the PSAs. Thus, this argument cannot be
sustained.

Next, the Respondents object that the Claimants have not provided a list of
events falling within the catch-all provision, explaining how the events prevented
performance. This argument is not concerned with the definition of Force
Majeure as such. For the sake of completeness however, the Tribunal notes
that this argument cannot be sustained. Along with their submissions before the
Hearing, the Claimants had submitted numerous documents, which, according
to them, referred to incidents qualifying as Force Majeure events.” In addition,
they had submitted two expert reports of Mr. Matthias Wieser of Control Risks.

8° Exh. C-171. Further, the Respondents’ witness introduced a report which also pointed to a
worsening situation in Yemen (Exh.R-133) (“intensification of existing risks” “[i]n early 2011, the
security situation deteriorated further’).

® Exh. R-133, which the Respondents have described as a “balanced and neutral account of the risk
situation in Yemen since 2006" (Respondents’ Overview Note §47).

* Rej. §302 (“[t]he only issue of law which arises in relation to these words is whether they are subject
to the requirements of unforeseeability and impossibility’).

82 See, for instance, Exhs. C- 12, 40, 56 etc. In addition, along with their post-hearing submission, the
Claimants submitted Exh.C-171 an “accumulated, non-exhaustive list of the (known) Force Majeure
events in the areas relevant for this case”. The list refers to documents already on record prior to the
Hearing, and the Respondents did not object to its introduction.

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 50 of 128

This evidence was never adequately challenged. Thus, while a list of the nature
envisaged by the Respondents may not have been produced, the relevant
evidence was on record. Further and in any event, the Tribunal recalls that in
their request to produce documents, the Claimants had requested the
Respondents to produce “all lists, overviews, evaluations, analyses, and reports
[...] of shootings, bomb attacks and killings”. The Respondents objected to the
production of such documents because they “lack[ed] sufficient relevance to the
case or materiality to its outcome.” The Tribunal finds that there is some tension
in the situation where the Respondents object on the basis that the Claimants
have not produced documents, and where the documents sought by the
Respondents are the same as those which the Respondents themselves
believed to be irrelevant and immaterial. Therefore, the Tribunal believes that it
is entitled to discount the objection. It is satisfied that the defined events
occurred.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that events which it has
characterized as Force Majeure events occurred on numerous occasions and in
multiple places, including at the relevant places in Yemen from March 2011 to
February 2013. These events were beyond the reasonable control of the
Claimants who did not cause them by their fault or negligence. They were
susceptible of preventing the Claimants’ performance of the PSAs. In effect, the
Tribunal concludes that a Force Majeure event in the sense of Art. 22.2 of the
PSAs occurred.

. The Tribunal is aware that the Respondents have opposed the Claimants’

position on fuel shortages,°? and one incident of kidnapping. Additionally, they
submit that “terrorism was not as bad [as the Claimants make out].” Above, the
Tribunal has found that several incidents not due to the fault or the negligence
of the Claimants and beyond the reasonable control of the Claimants occurred.
Thus, because it is not required to do so, the Tribunal does not analyze the
Parties opposing submissions on these two issues. Indeed, whether or not there
were fuel shortages or serious incidents of terrorism, it remains that several
other incidents not caused by the Claimants and not within their control

occurred — a position which the Respondents do not themselves appear to be
able to dispute.

For the reasons mentioned above [§110], the Tribunal need not determine
whether other events listed in Article 22.2 of the PSAs occurred. However, for
the sake of completeness, the Tribunal briefly reviews the Parties’ submissions
on the other events listed in Article 22.2 namely (a) direction of the Government,
(b) riot, and (c) insurrection. For the reasons mentioned below, except item (a),
the Tribunal believes that these Force Majeure events also occurred on
numerous occasions at the relevant places in Yemen.

For (a), in respect of the declaration of a State of Emergency on 18 March 2011
(‘the Declaration’), the Claimants submit that the Declaration is the “typical”
example of an “order, direction or regulation” in the sense of force majeure
clauses.°° The Respondents oppose this position. The Tribunal recalls that the
Declaration was binding in nature, something which the Respondents do not
dispute. Further, the Declaration was not limited to a few areas of Yemen,
rather it was based on a state of riots in some cities of Yemen. Thus, the
Tribunal believes that the Declaration is a Force Majeure event under Article
22.2 of the PSAs. Having reached this conclusion, the Tribunal does not find it
necessary to determine whether the Travel Advisories would equally qualify as
being “directions of the Government’ and, thus, Force Majeure events.

For (b), “riots”, the Claimants submit that “riot” is a commonly used term which
should be interpreted by applying the linguistic understanding of the term in
both English and Arabic. In English a “riot” is “an unlawful disturbance of the
peace by a number of people.” In Arabic, a “Shaghab”, the word mentioned in
Art. 22.2 of the Arabic version of the PSAs, means “any civil disturbance or civil
unrest, regardless of reason or cause.””” In any event, even if, as the
Respondents contend, Yemeni law applied to the interpretation of the term
“riot”, a legal protest as opposed to a riot would need prior approval, and the
Respondents had not produced any such approval.

126. By contrast, the Respondents submit that the term must be interpreted in a way

12

that is consistent with Yemeni law. For the Respondents, “riot” means “protests
which are illegal, not protests which fall within the legitimate right to protest or
demonstrate enshrined in the Yemeni Constitution.”*® Relying on Mr. Al
Maatari’s testimony, the Respondents contend that the term “riot” has “a
technical meaning”, associated with protests “which the police disperse
following a declaration for open fire.”

The Tribunal has specified the principles governing the interpretation of the
PSAs above [§76]. If the wording of a provision in the PSAs is clear, the words
must be given effect. Further, in giving effect to the words, the common
meaning of the words as well as the Yemeni law meaning of the words may be
considered. What is relevant however is always what the Parties intended at the
time they entered into the PSAs. While a dictionary meaning or specific
definitions in Yemeni law if there are any, is one way to look for that intent, one
should recall that the Parties probably did not refer to a dictionary at the time or
look for specific meanings under Yemeni law, and thus would rather think of a
common (ordinary/plain) meaning of terms.

The Tribunal believes that the common meaning of the term “riot” is a
disturbance of peace and order by several people acting together. This meaning
satisfies both the Arabic’ and the English’ versions of the PSAs. Understood
in this manner, the Tribunal believes that “riots” under Article 22.2 of the PSAs
took place in the parts of Yemen that would have been relevant for the
Claimants’ performance between March 2011 and February 2013.'” In any
event, even if the Respondents’ position - that the term should be given its
Yemeni law meaning — is adopted, it would not alter the Tribunal’s
determination. First, there is no legal definition of riot under Yemeni law,'°? and
the Respondents have not cogently explained why the incidents in question
would not constitute riots if the Yemeni law meaning of the term is applied.

Relying on Law No. 29 of 2003 concerning Demonstrations and Marches,’ the
Respondents appear to argue that if an application is made to a competent
authority prior to a demonstration, then it would not constitute a riot.'°° If this is
the case, then the Tribunal notes that the Respondents have in any event not
produced any applications in respect of the incidents that the Claimants allege
constitute riots. By the Respondents’ own arguments therefore, the incidents in
question should constitute riots under Article 22.2 of the PSAs.

The Respondents also appear to rely on Ministerial Decree No. 35 of 2002
Concerning the Police Authority to argue that riots have a technical meaning in
Yemeni law, which is associated with protests that the police disperse following
a declaration of open fire. First, the Tribunal notes that the Decree does not
expressly define what a riot is, rather it elaborates the powers of the police in
case a riot has already occurred. Second, it is counter-intuitive to suggest that a
protest can be a riot only if the authorities attempt to disperse it. If this was the
case, then it would mean that in situations where the relevant authorities have
ceased to function, there could be no “riots” at all; likewise, if the authorities, in
their discretion consider that dispersing a “riot” would possibly do more harm to
the public interest and safety than letting it run its course, there would be no riot
either. This cannot be correct. Third, what the Respondents effectively suggest
is that it is a police commander — not the court or other relevant authority - who
decides whether there is a riot or not (by opening fire). This too cannot be
correct.

Finally, the Respondents argue that the Claimants have not provided a list of
the locations and occasions on which riots took place, and that the Claimants
have failed to show how riots prevented their performance. These arguments
are not concerned with the definition of riots and are discussed elsewhere.
Thus, even if the Respondents’ arguments are considered, it remains that riots
within Art. 22.2 of the PSAs occurred.

For (c), insurrection, the Claimants submit that like “riots”, the term
“insurrection” should be given its plain meaning as “a situation in which
someone refuses the obedience of an order, regularly paired with the aim to

weaken the position of an established authority regardless of the means.” In
Arabic, “insurrection” / “Esyan” also refers to disobedience against the
established authority or government, whether or not arms are used." The
Claimants deny the Respondents’ submission that the term insurrection’ has to
be given a “Yemeni law meaning”.'”

By contrast, the Respondents submit that like riots, the term “insurrection” too
has to be interpreted in accordance with Yemeni law. Legal demonstrations
would not fall within the Yemeni law meaning of this term."°° For an act to
constitute an “insurrection”, it should fall within one of the acts of the Yemeni
Penal Code. According to the Respondents, there can be three types of
“insurrection” under Yemeni law: (i) armed insurrection, (ii) the incitement of an
armed insurrection by either the involvement of the military or the arming of the
populace and (3) opposition to a military leader by military personnel in the
carrying out of military duties, none of which the Claimants had established.

On the basis of its reasoning above [§127 et seq], the Tribunal believes that the
term insurrection is to be understood in its common meaning, which satisfies
both the English and Arabic versions of the PSAs. Insurrection means a violent
revolt against authority or government."° The Tribunal believes that
“insurrection” under Article 22.2 of the PSAs took place in the parts of Yemen
that would have been relevant for the Claimants’ performance between March
2011 and February 2013.""° As with the case of riots, here too, if the Tribunal
were to adopt the Respondents’ position that the term is to be given its Yemeni
law meaning, it would not change the Tribunal’s determination. Like riot, there is

no definition of insurrection under Yemeni law,'"'

and the Respondents have
not cogently explained why the incidents in question would not constitute
insurrection if the Yemeni law meaning of the term is applied. Further, like in the

case of riots, the Respondents have not produced any approval for the incidents

in question"? that would otherwise (on the Respondents’ own case), constitute
insurrection. Indeed, the events in question would fall within the provisions of
the Yemeni Civil Code and would satisfy even the three types of insurrection
identified by the Respondents. A review of the minutes of the meetings of the
Yemeni Cabinet also confirms insurrection in Yemen.'"°

Thus, the Tribunal concludes that Force Majeure event(s) in the sense of Article
22.2 of the PSAs occurred. The so-called “additional requirements” proposed by
the Respondents are considered below.

(ii) Additional Requirements

. The Respondents submit that the definition of Force Majeure under the PSAs is
not exhaustive, and “must be read with Yemeni law concepts in mind”.""* On
this premise, they insist that Art. 22.2 of the PSAs should be read as requiring a
Force Majeure event to be something that “was not foreseen or expected at the
time of contracting”'®, and something that is impossible to overcome, a position
which the Claimants oppose. The Parties’ arguments on the other “additional
requirements” are considered below.

a. The Claimants’ Position

According to the Claimants, it is undisputed that a contract cannot be
interpreted where the language is clear. The wording of the PSAs is exhaustive
and must be given effect."° The PSAs contain a clear definition of Force
Majeure in which the Parties chose to retain certain elements of force majeure
under general Yemeni law (“beyond the control”), but not others. Further, unlike
other PSA clauses, the Parties did not mention any recourse to Yemeni law in
Article 22 of the PSAs. To the Claimants, this “clearly proves the parties’ intent

to design a bespoke Force Majeure clause.”'"” On this basis, they claim that
they are not required to show anything else other than that the criteria set forth
in Art. 22 of the PSAs are met.

In support of their arguments, the Claimants also rely on Articles 18.2 and 24 of
the PSAs under which a Contractor's right to invoke Force Majeure and,
eventually, to terminate the PSAs for Force Majeure is a right solely governed
by the PSAs. According to them, a law requiring a more extensive showing for
Force Majeure would contain “an additional requirement” to those requirements
provided in the PSAs and, thus, would be inconsistent with the PSAs.

. Finally, relying on the principle of contra proferentem, the Claimants submit that

any ambiguity in the interpretation of Article 22.2 of the PSAs should be to
the detriment of Respondents. This means that it is sufficient for the
Claimants to show that the requirements of Article 22.2 of the PSAs are
satisfied. The other requirements of general Yemeni law are irrelevant.'"®

b. The Respondents’ Position

The Respondents submit that the PSAs are “Yemeni law contract[s] and,
therefore, the whole of Article 22 must be read with Yemeni eyes, and with the
Yemeni law concepts in mind.”""® Article 22 of the PSAs does not contract out of
the Yemeni law concept of Force Majeure that requires proof that the events
were unforeseen and that performance has become impossible. The PSAs do
not contain, or say that they contain, an exhaustive statement of all the
applicable rules on Force Majeure.'”° They point out that the Parties’ experts
agree that the Yemeni law concept of Force Majeure requires unforeseeability
and impossibility, and rely on National Oil Company v. Sun Oil Company of
Libya to conclude that force majeure provisions in a production sharing contract
cannot be interpreted independently of the applicable law.'?"

The Respondents also point out that the Claimants’ legal expert testified that
principles of good faith and good will apply to both interpretation and

performance of contracts. For the Respondents this means that “Art. 22.2
should be read as requiring a Force Majeure event to be something that was
not foreseen or expected at the time of contracting, and is beyond the control of
the parties.”

Finally, the Respondents submit that the Claimants’ own position is
“consistently confused”.'? While the Claimants say that the PSAs are
“exhaustive” of their legal commitments and must be interpreted without regard
to any other legal material, the Claimants nevertheless invite the Tribunal to
consider non-Yemeni legal materials for guidance as to the meaning of the
Force Majeure provisions.'**

c. Analysis

The Respondents first submit that as the PSAs are Yemeni law contracts,
Yemeni law principles (such as unforeseeability and impossibility) should be
implied into their terms. The Tribunal is unable to agree with this position. The
Parties’ experts agree that when the provisions of a contract are clear, they
should be given effect.’ For the reasons mentioned below, the Tribunal
believes that Article 22.2 of the PSAs is clear. As such, there is no scope or
need for implying Yemeni law requirements into the provision.

Article 22.2 starts by saying “Force Majeure within the meaning of this
Agreement, shall be”. The literal translation of the phrase in the Arabic version
of the PSAs is “what is meant by the terms [force majeure] within the meaning
of this Agreement is [...]". The Article then goes on to provide a list of events
which would constitute Force Majeure events for the purposes of the PSAs.
These events include commercial matters (strike, labor disturbances), political
matters (insurrection, riot, war and acts of the Government), and natural events
(acts of God, floods) etc. These events are specific and accurate. They also
have common features: all of the events listed in Article 22.2 are “beyond the
reasonable control” of the party relying on them and are not caused by that

party's fault or negligence (which Art. 22.2 itself mentions). None of the listed
events imply either unforeseeability (or impossibility) in the manner alleged by
the Respondents. Further, the Parties included some requirements of general
Yemeni law on force majeure (“beyond reasonable control”), while leaving out
others (unforeseeability).

&

In the Tribunal’s view, the language of the clause makes clear that the Parties
agreed to their own custom-made definition of Force Majeure for the PSAs. The
clause is self-contained and clear. The Claimants’ expert, Mr. Luqman’s
testimony on this point was illustrative:

“MR LUQMAN: I see the force majeure Article quite clear. If the parties
wanted to apply the rules of force majeure they would have said in the
event of force majeure then the party would be excused from execution
but they did not say that and they went into giving specific events
forming force majeure and once that event has occurred or persisted,
then the definition is clear. | can further elaborate. For example, the
parties wanted to give a wider definition in favour of the party wishing to
rely on force majeure. An example of that, when they talk about
direction and order and words, they could have used one word but they
have used different words and, in my view, it was there to widen the
scope of application of the clause. Another example in the clause is
where | think it was discussed maybe yesterday, an order by the
Government, | think was in agreement by a promulgate by a law or
otherwise. This "otherwise" to me opens the door wider in favour of the
party relying on force majeure because it could be a Government order
which is issued by law or otherwise. Otherwise to me could be a mere
announcement as an example or publication or an article. So | feel that
the Article was not only clear of what it was designed to do but also it
attempted to open the door wider than what was actually spelt out even
in it.”

By contrast, Mr. Al Maqtari testified that Art. 22.2 was unclear and ambiguous:

“MR AL-MAKTARI: Article 22 is composed of different paragraphs, 1, 2,
3, 4. | think that the force majeure is not defined in a clear manner here.
There are only specific events that are considered to be force majeure
events but the definition of the force majeure is not clear in this Article.
It has given some cases or events such as riots, insurrections, fire,
floods. So it has defined them as force majeure events if they happen
and even for riots and insurrection we do not have a definition of them.
This is unclear and this is ambiguous and this is why we have to go, to
resort to other things to be able to interpret them. This is the first
ambiguity that | find in this Article, in all its paragraphs. Another thing, it
has said that the period for ending the agreement is not clearly set. So

there is no definite period of time. This is why we need here to apply the
immediacy principle and this is why we needed more clarity. Thank

. The Tribunal is unable to agree with this position.

. First, Mr. Al Maqtari testifies that some of the terms used in Article 22.2 are not
clear (riots, insurrection etc.) because they have not been defined. According to
the Tribunal, simply because a provision does not define all the terms contained
in it, it does not — by virtue of that fact itself - make the provision ambiguous.
Several provisions of the PSAs do not define all of the terms they contain. It
would not be correct to characterize all of them as being ambiguous. Moreover,
even if some words in a particular provision are ambiguous, ascertaining the
true meaning of those words would be limited to interpreting those words
themselves, and not by introducing additional words into the provision that are
unrelated to the ambiguous words. Mr. Al Maqtari has not explained why
ambiguity (if any), in the definition of the terms “riot”, “insurrection” etc. should
lead the Tribunal to introduce the unrelated legal requirement of
unforeseeability (or impossibility) into Article 22. With respect, the Tribunal finds
it difficult to agree with Mr. Al Maqtari on this point.

Mr. Al Magtari next submits that Article 22 of the PSAs is ambiguous because
“the period for ending the agreement is not clearly set.” It appears that Mr. Al
Maatari's comments were directed towards Article 22.4 of the PSAs which
provides the time for termination of the PSAs. They are of less importance here
where the Tribunal is considering the definition of Force Majeure events in Art.
22.2 of the PSAs. In any event, the Tribunal cannot agree with Mr. Al Maqtari’s
views (whether in relation to Art. 22.2 or otherwise). Indeed, even if the time for
termination of the PSAs is ambiguous, the Tribunal cannot see why this would
require an additional, unrelated requirement of unforeseeability (or impossibility)
to be added into the PSAs. The ambiguity, if any, in respect of the time of
termination of the PSAs would be resolved in accordance with principles
mentioned above [§76]. That is an altogether different matter from inserting an
additional, unrelated requirement of unforeseeability (or impossibility) which has
not been expressly contemplated by the Parties. Ambiguity in one provision

cannot serve to insert additional, unrelated requirements in another provision,

150.

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 60 of 128

and no cogent explanation has been furnished as to why this should be the
case. This is all the more so in circumstances where Art. 22.2 is self-contained,
and where the insertion of the additional requirements would impose an
additional burden on the Claimants.

For all these reasons, the Tribunal believes that the provisions of Article 22.2
are clear.

This position is reinforced by looking at the other terms of the PSA. For
instance, Article 11.6 provides “[i]Jn the course of performing the Petroleum
Operations, the Contractor [...] shall comply with [...] the laws, decrees and
other rules and regulations.” Thus, when the Parties wanted to introduce
general Yemeni law, they used specific language to do so. The Tribunal recalls
that the parties that entered into the PSAs come from countries that have
different legal traditions. It is not surprising therefore that they clearly intended
their rights and obligations under the PSAs to be solely governed by the PSAs
themselves, “8 which are also Yemeni laws. The Parties clearly intended the
PSAs to be self-contained (Article 18.2'7°), with limited (and specific) references
to other Yemeni laws (Art. 11.6). In fact, the PSAs show an intent of the Parties
to exclude reference to Yemeni law when Yemeni law should prove to be
inconsistent with the PSAs (Article 24). The presumption is thus that the
Tribunal should be slow in turning to Yemeni laws to interpret the PSAs as this
would require proving first that there is a need for clarifying a contractual
provision (which is not the case here) and then that the applicable Yemeni law
provisions do not contradict the common intent of the Parties.

Further, the Tribunal notes that Art. 2 of Republican Decree No. 23 of 2007
relied on by the Respondents contains an express “unforeseeability”
requirement. The PSAs were drafted by the Respondents, and negotiated in
2007 and 2008. Thus, if the Respondents wanted to introduce other
requirements into the definition of Force Majeure in the PSAs and the Claimants
agreed to that introduction, they could have done so. This is all the more so in

™° art. 18.2 of the PSAs.

129 Article 18.2 of the PSAs (‘Interests, rights and obligations of the GOVERNMENT that are
represented by the MINISTRY and of the CONTRACTOR [...] shall be solely governed by the
provisions of this Agreement and may be altered or amended only by the mutual agreement of the
Parties, which will be subject to approval by a law to be issued according to the constitutional
procedures in the ROY.").

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 61 of 128

the present case where some requirements of general Yemeni law have been
introduced (“beyond reasonable control”) into the definition of Force Majeure by
the Parties. For these reasons as well, the Tribunal believes that the additional
requirements proposed by the Respondents should not be read into Article 22.2
of the PSAs.
. The Respondents also submit that if the Claimants’ arguments are followed, it
would mean that any act which is outside the control of the Parties (such as
Hurricane Katrina) would fall within the definition of Force Majeure in the PSAs.
Since that cannot be the case, it means that one has to turn to the general
requirements of Yemeni law while interpreting Article 22 of the PSAs. The
Tribunal is unable to agree. Article 22 sets out the scheme applicable in cases
of Force Majeure: Article 22.2 defines Force Majeure, Article 22.1 excuses non-
performance of only those obligations that have been caused by Force Majeure
and Article 22.4 contemplates termination in case of Force Majeure persisting
for six months. While it may be that when read in isolation Article 22.2 of the
PSAs could be interpreted to include any Act of God, such an interpretation in
isolation would not be helpful. The party intending to rely on any act for
suspending (or terminating) its obligations would have to show how that act
caused its non-performance. Reading the provisions of the same article in the
same agreement together to ascertain how those provisions operate is not the
same as implying into those provisions unrelated elements of law, especially in
circumstances where those unrelated elements do not clarify the operation of
the provisions in question but rather serve to impose an additional burden on
the party seeking to rely on those provisions. The Tribunal therefore cannot
sustain this argument.
In support of their case, the Respondents rely on the decision in National Oil
Company v. Sun Oil Company of Libya.‘ The Tribunal believes that the
decision has limited persuasive value because the case concerned an
altogether different contract and an altogether different applicable law. It is true
that the tribunal in that case found that the force majeure provision in the
contract in question could not be interpreted independently of the applicable

1 Exh, RL-8.

58

153.

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 62 of 128

law.'*' However, the Tribunal notes that in that case force majeure was defined
as follows: “Force Majeure shall include, without limitation Acts of God,
insurrection, riots war, and any unforeseen circumstances and acts beyond the
control...”. In its analysis, the tribunal found the clause to be non-exhaustive
(‘not as constituting per se events of force majeure”), and vague. It also
observed that because the clause was drafted in a particular manner, if it was
not interpreted to include the requirement of impossibility of performance under
the applicable Libyan law, any circumstance beyond the control of the parties
would excuse non-performance subject to the sole condition that such
circumstance was not foreseen. The tribunal found that this could not have
been the intention of the contracting parties as it would result in the
enforceability of contractual obligations being challenged on the occurrence of
the slightest difficulty. For these reasons, the tribunal turned to the applicable
Libyan law. The force majeure definition in Sun Oil is in stark contrast with the
definition of Force Majeure under the PSAs (“Force Majeure [...] shall be”).

 

Unlike in Sun Oil, where the tribunal found the force majeure clause to be non-
exhaustive and vague, here, the Tribunal has found that the force majeure
definition is clear and conclusive. This alone is sufficient to distinguish the
present case from that in Sun Oil. Further, the result in Sun Oil — that since
impossibility of performance was not mentioned in the clause, any event,
however trivial, would qualify as a force majeure event — would not apply for the
PSAs. Indeed, the Parties here agree that Article 22.1 of the PSAs requires that
the Force Majeure event in question must have caused non-performance of the
Claimants’ obligations."** Finally, the Tribunal notes that the tribunal in Sun Oil
identified a trend in long term international contracts to define force majeure
less strictly than under domestic contracts and that it noted that “[t]he fact that
the Parties felt it necessary to include [...] a force majeure clause, demonstrates
that they were not satisfied with the mere application of the rules in the
[applicable law]”.‘°?

In the circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to agree with the first limb of the
Respondents’ argument that the additional requirements (of unforseeability or

‘1 Exh. RL-8, Chapter 3, §§1.6-1.9.

impossibility) should be implied into Article 22 of the PSAs because they are
Yemeni law contracts.

The Respondents also argue that general Yemeni law applies unless there is
something that contracts out of it.'** Here too, the Tribunal cannot agree. First,
this argument is contrary to the Respondents’ (and their expert's) position that a
contractual provision is not subject to interpretation if the wording of the
provision is clear. Second, the Tribunal recalls that Article 11.6 of the PSAs
contains a specific and detailed invocation of Yemeni law. Thus, when the
Parties wanted Yemeni law to apply, they clearly knew how to manifest their
intention. The Respondents have not furnished any reason why Yemeni law
should apply to insert additional obligations on a party when the provision in
question itself does not, unlike other provisions of the PSAs, contemplate the
application of Yemeni law. For all of these reasons, this contention cannot be
sustained.

The Respondents next submit that the additional requirements should be
implied into the PSAs because of the principles of good faith and good will. The
Tribunal surmises that the argument is based on the provisions of Article 23.10
of the PSAs. Here too, the Tribunal cannot agree with the Respondents’
position. Article 23.10 of the PSAs provides that “[t]he Parties hereto base their
relationship under this Agreement on the principles of goodwill and good faith.
The interpretation and application of the provisions of this Agreement with
respect to the Arbitration shall be in accordance with the Yemeni laws that are
outlined in Article 24 of the Agreement.” The first sentence of Article 23.10
specifies that the principles of good will and good faith are to assist the Parties
in determining what they are to do under the PSAs. The second sentence then
provides that in matters of interpretation and application of the PSAs, Yemeni
laws mentioned in Article 24 are to apply. Article 24 does not refer to principles
of good will and good faith. Thus, it appears that these principles cannot directly
be used as a tool of interpretation by virtue of Article 23.10. Rather, they are to
be used in determining the appropriate manner in which the Parties should act
in a given situation. Mr. Luqman’s testimony on this point was illustrative:

“THE PRESIDENT: You said that good faith and goodwill means that
the party must have the intent to perform. My question is then what do

14 Rej, §160.

60

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 64 of 128

goodwill and good faith add to the fact that the parties anyway has the
obligation to perform? What does it add? what is the added value to
those principles?

DR LUQMAN: [...] Good faith and good intent or goodwill is often relied
on when things do not go exactly as set out in the contract. [...] What it
adds, it adds probably a smooth way forward in the event of a deadlock.

THE PRESIDENT: Second question: when it comes again to the
operation of good faith and goodwill, does it go to the interpretation of
the contract, namely, when you look for the intent of the parties or of
each party, | do not know, but when you look for the intent of the parties
to determine what the exact obligations of the parties are, do you use
the good faith and the goodwill or do you use the good faith or the
goodwill principle? That is one. Do the good faith and goodwill
principles have another role, alternatively or cumulatively, which is
when the parties do perform their obligations which are not as such in)
question, do they have also to perform in good faith and according to
goodwill? You understand my question?

DR LUQMAN: Yes. I believe that | agree with both your questions.”**>

156. In sum, the Tribunal believes that it cannot directly or principally rely on the

principles of good will and good faith mentioned in Article 23.10 of the PSAs as

a tool to interpreting Article 22.2 of the PSAs. In that context, those principles

are more concerned with the determination of the Parties’ intent to ascertain

their obligations or with the determination of the performance of the Parties’

obligations under the PSAs. Good faith and good will are useful to interpret the

will of the Parties or to apply the contract as Article 23.10 of the PSAs provides

because each Party has to accept in good faith what its consent implied. These

principles are however not meant to enable arbitrators to second-guess what

the Parties could have added to their common understanding, including, if that

should be the case, by reference to provisions of Yemeni law to which the

Parties did not refer, not even impliedly. In any event, it is unlikely that Yemeni

law would operate in a manner such that general principles of good will and

good faith will apply to introduce additional legal requirements into carefully

negotiated provisions. The Respondents have not advanced any cogent
reasoning why this should be the case.

185 Tr, 1031-1033. See also Tr. 1030:9-15 ("MS SABBEN-CLARE: What does good faith and goodwill

mean under Yemeni law, please?” DR LUQMAN: It means the literal translation in Arabic. It means

having the good intent, having good intention to act in accordance with the obligations of the
contract, for example.”)

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 65 of 128

. It is however possible that the principles of good will and good faith apply to

interpretation through the applicable Yemeni law (i.e. to the extent these
principles are recognised by the Commercial Code, the Civil Code, Sharia
principles and general customs). However, as mentioned above [§76], these
sources would apply only if the provisions of the PSAs are unclear — something
which is not the case for Article 22.2 of the PSAs.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal denies the Respondents’ submissions that
additional requirements (whether of unforeseeability or impossibility) should be
read into Article 22.2 of the PSAs. The PSAs provide a self-contained definition
of Force Majeure.

In any event, even if the Yemeni law requirement of unforeseeability is
introduced into Article 22 of the PSAs (whether because of Yemeni law or
because of good faith), it would not alter the Tribunal’s decision. The
Respondents argue that the types of risk that the Claimants allege amount to
Force Majeure under the PSAs already existed at the time of entering into the
PSAs. The risks were not unforeseeable, and hence the Claimants are not
entitled to rely on them.'®° The Tribunal cannot agree with this position. Merely
because a risk existed at the time of entering into a contract does not preclude
a party from relying on an increase in that risk to exclude its obligations in the
course of the contract. Indeed, if this was not the case, it would mean that a
party intending to rely on an increased risk under a contract would be unable to
do so simply because the existence of the risk was contemplated at the time of
contracting. This cannot be correct. Put differently, the Respondents’ argument
means that if numerous labor strikes occur, then the party wishing to rely on the
strikes as a force majeure event would be unable to do so because strikes, per
se, existed at the time of contracting (as it was mentioned in the contract). This
cannot be correct. Rather, what is more appropriate is an analysis of whether
there was a significant and sharp increase in risk beyond what was
contemplated by the Parties at the time of contracting. If that is the case, then
any “foreseeability” requirement would be met.'*” The Tribunal believes that
there was such a significant increase in risk in the parts of Yemen that would
have been relevant for the Claimants’ performance between March 2011 and

18° R-PHB §185.

February 2013. After all, as recounted above [§117], at the time, the Republic
declared a State of Emergency, Cabinet Meetings to discuss “national security”
issues were held almost on a weekly basis, several States issued travel
advisories and the United Nations Security Council had also issued two
Resolutions about the worsening security situation." The number of security
incidents and their seriousness reflected in these developments could not have
been foreseen at the time of contracting and there is no valid reason to say that
they were. The unexpected and severe nature of the security incidents was also
reflected in internal correspondence between PEPA and Respondent 2. For
instance, on 4 March 2012, PEPA’s Undersecretary for Exploration Affairs wrote
to the PEPA Chairman acknowledging that KNOC, the operator of Block 4 (a
production block in Shabwa governorate) had been unable to work because of
“L...] the critical circumstances in the last period.”"*° A day later, the PEPA
Chairman wrote to Respondent 2 attributing the operator's inability to function to
“the exceptional situation of the country within the last year’."“° The
unexpectedness of the deteriorating situation was also mentioned by several oil
companies in their correspondence with Respondent 2.1 Besides, the
Claimants’ expert, Mr. Wieser, reviewed the situation in Yemen and in the
Blocks, and concluded that there was a change in the risk level from for some
risk types (“tribal unrest’, “crime and kidnapping”, “transport and logistics’) from
2010 to February 2013.'*? His testimony on this issue was not convincingly
rebutted.

160. Similarly, if the Yemeni law requirement of impossibility is introduced into Article

So

22 of the PSAs (whether because of Yemeni law or because of good faith), it
too would not alter the Tribunal’s decision. At the Hearing, Mr. Al Maqtari stated
that “impossibility” in the context of force majeure meant that it was not possible

188 To @ limited extent, the Respondents appear to agree with this position (“As to the risk of armed
clashes in rural areas, to the extent that such clashes involved tribal unrest and tensions, the
Respondents accept that the general risk was somewhat greater in 2011 than it had been at the
time of contracting but not in a way which made oil exploration work impossible (emphasis
supplied)’(SoD §173)).

Respondents are introduced into Article 22.2 of the PSAs (whether because of

The Claimants’ Force Majeure case is not concerned with the entire territory of

between Al-Jawf and western Hadramaut is relevant for the present dispute. '“°

On their part, the Respondents submit that the Claimants must show that the
relevant Force Majeure event occurred throughout the territories of each Block.
They further submit that “[t]he security situation varies from block to block and
the alleged experiences of one operator in one block cannot be equated with
the likely experiences of a different operator in a different block”."“° The Tribunal
addresses this issue below.

The Tribunal recalls that:

e the territory of Respondent 1 is politically subdivided into the area of the
capital Sana’a and several governorates. For the purpose of oil
exploration and production, it is in part divided into blocks. A block may
extend into one or more governorates; "*”

e Block 19 measures around 8,400 sq. km. and touches on four different
governorates (Sana’a, Marib, Al-Jawf, and Amran). Block 57 measures
around 10,900 sq. km. and touches on three different governorates (AI-
Jawf, Hadhramaut and Marib). Block 28 measures around 4,400 sq. km.
and touches on two governorates (Shabwa and Hadhramaut).

Therefore, the Tribunal’s examination must involve an examination of the
conditions in the relevant parts of the relevant governorates in which the Blocks
fall (Sana’a, Marib, Al-Jawf, Amran, Hadhramut, Shabwa).

In addition, the Tribunal recalls that the Respondents themselves emphasized
the importance of the capital to the Claimants’ operations, insisting that under
the PSAs, the Claimants’ staff should have been permanently stationed in
Sana’a.“* Thus, the Respondents appear to agree that besides the Blocks,
Sana’a (city) too should be included in the Tribunal’s analysis. The Tribunal
believes that this is correct. The capital’s airport would have been used to
facilitate the movement of seismic crews and other personnel and equipment
that would have worked in the Blocks (and for evacuation in cases of
emergency). In addition, Mr. Dave’s testimony — that oil companies operating in

148 Rej. §35 (the Respondents insist on Claimants’ opening an office in Sana’a, and complaining that

importance of the General Manager having a permanent presence in Yemen).

Yemen need an office in the capital in order to interact with PEPA and that all
exploration activity goes through Sana’a with material, personnel and
equipment coming from the Sana’a office — was not expressly challenged. Thus,
the Tribunal adds the capital city Sana’a to the relevant part of the relevant
governorates in which the Blocks fall.

Finally, the Parties agree that the Claimants and their subcontractors would
have to travel to the Blocks by road. In fact, in the course of their cross-
examinations, the Respondents emphasized the importance of the approach
roads that the Claimants’ subcontractors would have to take to reach the
Blocks. Indeed, the approach roads would have been essential inter alia for the
mobilization of seismic crews. Thus, events taking place on the roads to the
Blocks as well as roads within the Blocks would be relevant.

In sum, in analyzing the alleged Force Majeure events, the following locations
are relevant: (i) the relevant part of the relevant governorates in which the
Blocks fall (Sana’a, Marib, Al-Jawf, Amran, Hadhramut, Shabwa); (ii) the capital
Sana’a and (iii) roads to the Blocks and within the Blocks. Further, it is not
necessary that the alleged Force Majeure events must have taken place
everywhere within these locations. Indeed, what is relevant is that the alleged
Force Majeure events — even if isolated from each other — prevented the
performance of the Claimants’ obligations.

The Tribunal has reviewed the detailed schedule submitted by the Claimants
chronicling the security situation in Yemen from 2011 to 2013'*° as well as the
numerous other exhibits on record'®° keeping these points in mind. The Tribunal
concludes that several incidents qualifying as Force Majeure event(s) occurred

at these locations.'®'

wo

(except the State of Emergency), lasted for at least six months. But even if the
Tribunal were to disagree with that position, they submit that “the Tribunal
should consider all security events together and treat them as one
comprehensive “other cause”, which continued to occur for more than six
months.”'®?

The Claimants deny the Respondents’ submission that the relevant Force
Majeure events were merely “episodic” — a term which the Respondents had
themselves not defined. According to the Claimants, it is not necessary for a
“tiot” to exist day and night. What is relevant is that the riots in question created
danger and insecurity such that a reasonable operator could not plan and
execute its operations. The same is true for terrorism.'® In any event, “riots”,
“insurrection” and “terrorism” all occurred on multiple occasions between early
2011 until February 2013.

. According to the Claimants, the Respondents’ arguments are legally flawed. It is

not correct to rely on a singular “event” in Article 22.4 of the PSAs (“the Force
Majeure event’) because the singular simply means that “the Force Majeure
status” or “situation” should continue for six months, not requiring each singular
event to persist for six months. Inserting the plural instead of the singular form
(ie., “If the Force Majeure events occur [...]”) would make it seem as if the
clause required more than one Force Majeure event to occur, which is not the
case. Moreover, the rationale of the Force Majeure provision is to relieve the
obligor of his duties in circumstances in which the working environment has
become detrimental. For this, it does not matter whether it was a “riot” or an
“insurrection” that prevented performance. What is relevant is the prevention of
performance for six months.

174. In any event, the Claimants submit that should any doubts remain in the correct
interpretation of Article 22.2, the clause should be interpreted to the detriment of
the Respondents, in accordance with the contra proferentem rule.

b. The Respondents’ position

17!

a

In contrast to the Claimants’ submissions above, the Respondents characterise
the Force Majeure events as “episodic”, and incapable of preventing the
Claimants’ performance for a continuous period of six months. '®* Citing several
examples, they submit that the security situation was much better from 27
February 2012 onwards.

17

7

According to them, it is wrong for the Claimants to contend as they do that if
conditions of Force Majeure exist for six months but then revert to normal for 12
months (during which time the contractor is to perform its contractual
obligations), the contractor can nevertheless terminate the contract at the end of
the 12 months on the basis of the conditions which ended six months earlier. "°°
177. The Respondents submit that the Claimants would be entitled to rely on only
those Force Majeure events which occurred immediately prior to their notice of
termination. The Claimants’ contention that any six months period would suffice
and, specifically that the period from mid-March 2011 and mid-September 2011
and between early October 2011 and early March 2012, “offends the obligation
of good faith under the PSAs”." Besides, it is also wrong as a matter of
construction of the PSAs.

c. Analysis

178. The Tribunal recalls that Article 22.4 of the PSAs provides that:

“If the Force Majeure event occurs during either the First Exploration
Period or the Second Exploration Period or any extension(s) thereof
and continues in effect for a period of six (6) Months, thereafter the
CONTRACTOR shall have the option upon ninety (90) Days’ prior
written notice to the MINISTRY to terminate its obligations hereunder

* SoD §199.

68

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 72 of 128

without further liability of any kind except for those payments accrued
under this Agreement.”

179. The Respondent contends that the Force Majeure events in question were

18

18

S

“episodic” and as a result cannot be found to have prevented the Claimants
performance for a continuous period of six months. The Tribunal is unable to
agree. First, the word “continuous” does not appear in the text of Article 22.4 of
the PSAs. The clause says that the Force Majeure event must “continue in
effect’ for six months. What is important therefore is that the effect of the Force
Majeure event must continue for at least six months, not the event itself. Such
an understanding is in line with the general purpose of a force majeure
provision — the clause remedies a situation in which a party is unable to perform
its contractual obligations not because of its own fault and/or negligence but
because of circumstances beyond its control. The focus must be on the
situation created by the event which prevents performance, rather than on the
event itself. If that were not the case, it would mean that a party would be
unable to claim force majeure on account of a flood/earthquake which lasted
only one day, but whose effects were felt for a considerable time thereafter, for
instance because it destroyed the facilities that party required for its
performance.

Thus, the Tribunal believes that it must consider whether the effect of the Force
Majeure events continued for six months. As above, the Tribunal has identified
one of the Force Majeure event(s) to be the deterioration of the security
situation in Yemen. The question therefore is whether the effect of this Force
Majeure event continued for a period of six months.

. On a review of the relevant exhibits in the record, the Tribunal believes this to

be the case.'® It appears to the Tribunal that numerous incidents of social and
tribal unrest, sectarian clashes, crimes, kidnapping and other incidents affecting
peace and security took place on numerous occasions at the relevant places in
Yemen in the period March 2011 to February 2013. The effect of such incidents
lasted for more than six months, as a result of which the Tribunal believes that
this requirement of Article 22.4 of the PSAs is satisfied.

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 73 of 128

. The Tribunal is aware of the Respondents’ argument that the Claimants must
show that they were prevented from performance in the six months immediately
preceding the notice of termination of 13 February 2013, and that any six month
period from March 2011 to February 2013 would not suffice. Above, the
Tribunal has found that the effect of the deteriorating security situation in
Yemen lasted from March 2011 to February 2013 i.e. it was felt in the six
months leading up to the Claimants’ notice of termination of 13 February 2013.
Thus, the Tribunal need not consider the Respondents’ argument. However, for
the sake of completeness, the Tribunal notes that it does not believe that a
party that was prevented from performing its obligations for six months because
of force majeure loses its right to rely on force majeure after the expiry of that
six month period. Indeed, after the expiry of the six month period of force
majeure, a party may choose to wait for some time, for instance in order to
determine whether performance again becomes possible. If, at that time, it
appears that performance is not to be possible, then that party should not be
penalized for having waited rather than having terminated.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal believes that the Force Majeure events
lasted from March 2011 to February 2013.

Having thus found that Force Majeure event(s) occurred in the parts of Yemen
that would have been relevant for the Claimants’ performance for the relevant
duration, the Tribunal now turns to the analysis of whether the Force Majeure
event(s) caused the Claimants’ non-performance.

Did the Force Majeure event(s) cause the Claimants’ non-performance?

The Parties agree that Article 22.1 of the PSAs requires “causation”. For the
Claimants, this means “a sufficient link between the event and the
consequence, nothing more.”® By contrast, the Respondents submit that
“causation” in Article 22.1 requires a “but-for” analysis.'°? Consequently, the
Tribunal first examines the applicable test of causation ((a) below), and then

-PHB §220.
oD §151.

186.

187.

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 74 of 128

proceeds to determine whether the relevant events caused the Claimants’ non-
performance ((b) below).

a. The relevant test
i. The Claimants’ position

. According to the Claimants, since the PSAs do not provide a definition for
“causation”, it is a matter of interpretation under which circumstances Force
Majeure can be considered to have “caused” non-performance."® For them,
“causation” in Article 22.1 of the PSAs means “a sufficient link between the
event and the consequence, nothing more.”'*' They oppose the Respondents’
“but for” test of causation for several reasons. First, according to them, the
“but for” test contradicts the wording of Art. 22.1 of the PSAs (“if and to the
extent that...”) which “[shows that] the causation-test in the PSAs is not
digital, [...] if other factors than Force Majeure intervene, non-performance can
be excused to a given extent only.” Second, the “but for” test would unfairly
benefit the host state, that could profit from its own shortcomings in violation of
the principle of nullus commodum capere potest de iniuria sua propria.

The Claimants also reject the Respondents’ submission that they cannot rely
on Force Majeure in a situation in which they have already breached an
obligation under the PSAs. They submit that under the PSAs, it is enough if
their performance was prevented, regardless of whether they would otherwise
have performed.'®* According to them: “‘Force Majeure” as a general legal
concept is a superior intervention into the equilibrium of a contract. If a superior
force intervenes, the equilibrium is destroyed, and debtors are for objective
reasons no longer obliged to perform.” They point out that Article 22.1 of the
PSAs itself assumes a situation of non-performance: the Article provides that
Force Majeure can serve as an “excuse” if and to the extent it causes non-

performance, which assumes that there can be non-performance that is

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 75 of 128

partially excused (“to the extent”) and partially non-excused. If the provision

itself foresees that both, an excused and a non-excused part of non-

performance can exist simultaneously, it is wrong to say that the contractor

cannot rely on Force Majeure in a situation of breach.

ii. |The Respondents’ position

188. The Respondents deny the Claimants’ submissions. According to them, Article

22 of the PSAs only applies if performance is prevented by Force Majeure,

which can only be the case if the contracting party would have performed but for

the alleged Force Majeure events. They submit that “it was the Claimants

own delayed and unstructured approach to performance coupled with their

inability to resolve the ongoing dispute with their joint venture partners that in

fact prevented performance in this case.”"® In sum, the Respondents contend

that the Claimants’ performance was not prevented by Force Majeure. '”

189. The Respondents point to the words used in Article 22.1 of the PSAs (“non-

performance or delay...caused by Force Majeure”) and submit that the text

“clearly” implies that the “but for” causation is required. Alternatively, they

submit that the “but for’ test is the only construction of Article 22.1 which is

consistent with the principles of good faith and good will, principles that apply to

both the interpretation and the performance of contracts.’
iii. Analysis

190. The Tribunal recalls that Article 22.1 of the PSAs provides that:

“The non-performance or the delay in performance by the MINISTRY
or the CONTRACTOR of any obligations under this Agreement other
than the obligation to pay any amounts due or giving notices shall be
excused if, and to the extent that, such non-performance or delay is
caused by Force Majeure.”

72

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 76 of 128

191. Thus, the provision does not define causation for the purposes of Article 22 of

19;

N

the PSAs. For the Claimants, the “causation” requirement of Article 22.1 is
satisfied if there is a link between the Force Majeure event and the Claimants’
non-performance. On their part, the Respondents first contend that the
Claimants cannot rely on Force Majeure in a situation in which they have
already breached the PSAs. Next, they argue that the Claimants must show that
they would have performed “but for” Force Majeure, and that the Claimants
must also show that they were willing to perform. Each of these submissions is
considered below.

(a) Force Majeure in case of breach

. The Respondents’ expert contended that the Claimants cannot rely on Article
22.1 of the PSAs because by the time the Force Majeure events started, the
Claimants had already breached the PSAs.'® However, in their submission, the
Respondents clarified that their argument was not that a prior breach
automatically precludes reliance on Article 22 of the PSAs. Rather, their position
was that the Force Majeure event, not some other factor must have caused
non-performance.'”° The Tribunal understands this to be the Respondents’ “but
for’ argument, which is considered below. In any event, the Tribunal clarifies
that a prior breach would not exclude reliance on Article 22 of the PSAs. Article
22.1 of the PSAs provides that non-performance is excused only to the extent it
is caused by Force Majeure events. Thus, Article 22.1 excuses only the Force
Majeure affected non-performance. It does not consider other non-performance
— which non-performance may cause a breach of the provisions of the PSAs.
The language of Article 22.1 of the PSAs does not appear to preclude the
possibility of a party in breach of some obligations of the PSAs claiming Force
Majeure in respect of its other obligations of the PSAs. It is therefore possible
that a party that has breached a provision of the PSAs can rely on Article 22.1

*°° Al Maqtari WS | §36.

7 SoD §151 ("For the avoidance of doubt, the ’ in relation to ion is that
the words of Article 22.1 explicitly excuse non-performance if but only if non-performance is “caused
by Force Majeure”. The requirement that the Force Majeure event, not some other factor, must have
caused the non-performance is, thus, part of the contractual term Contrary to paragraphs 290-296 of
the Statement of Claim, this is not an argument that a prior breach automatically precludes reliance
on the Force Majeure clause. It is an argument of causation.”)

193.

194.

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 77 of 128

of the PSAs and claim Force Majeure events have prevented it from performing
some other obligations of the PSAs. Thus, even if the Claimants had breached
the PSAs in respect of their obligations at the time of the Force Majeure events,
it remains that the Claimants would nevertheless be entitled to rely on Article
22.1 in respect of their other obligations under the PSAs.

(b) “But For” test

As mentioned above, the Respondents submit that “causation” in Article 22.1
requires a “but-for” analysis.'’' The Tribunal finds it difficult to agree with this
position. For the reasons mentioned above [§142 et seq.], the Tribunal believes
that the PSAs set out a self-contained regime for Force Majeure, and for
termination as a result thereof. Article 22.1 of the PSAs simply requires non-
performance or delay to be caused by Force Majeure (“such non-performance
or delay is caused by Force Majeure”). Thus, as long as there is an obligation
that a party is prevented from performing because of Force Majeure, then,
irrespective of whether some other event could have also caused non-
performance, that party is entitled to rely on Article 22 of the PSAs to terminate
the PSAs (provided the other conditions of Article 22 are satisfied). Put
differently, for the purposes of Article 22.1 of the PSAs, the Tribunal does not
believe that the Claimants have to show that Force Majeure was the only cause
of their non-performance. This requirement is not found in the text of Article
22.1. Instead, what a party relying on Force Majeure is to show is that Force
Majeure prevented its performance.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal need not analyze whether; (i) a “dispute
among the JV partners” prevented the Claimants’ performance; (ii) there was
some “other breach of obligations” that caused or could have caused the
Claimants’ non-performance; (iii) “other reasons” were the “real reasons” for
Claimants’ non-performance (such as the existence of landmines in the blocks,
delay in provision of the correct block co-ordinates); and (iv) it would have been
impossible for the Claimants to perform in the remaining time. Indeed, whatever
be the outcome of these arguments, what is relevant for the purposes of

™ SoD §151.

74

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 78 of 128

termination of the PSAs under Article 22 is that the Claimants were prevented
from performing their obligations because of intervening Force Majeure
event(s).

(c) “Willingness to Perform”

195. The Tribunal also does not believe that Article 22.1 of the PSAs requires the
party relying on Force Majeure to show its willingness to perform had the Force
Majeure event not occurred. For the reasons mentioned above [§142 et seq.]
additional requirements should not be introduced into Article 22.2 of the PSAs.
This is all the more so in the case where the Parties’ legal experts appear to
agree that the “willingness to perform” requirement is not found in the PSAs or
under general Yemeni law:

e In respect of the PSAs, Mr. Luqman testified that:
“DR LUQMAN: Causation, in my view, would be a link between the
force majeure event and non-performance

DR BURIANSKI: Does causation depend on the willingness to
perform?

DR LUQMAN: No, this is not what is in the contract. What is in the
contract is causation causing non-performance. So there should be
a sufficient link between the FM event and non-performance,”"”*

e In respect of force majeure under general Yemeni law, in his written and
oral testimony, Mr. Al Magtari never mentioned the requirement of
“willingness to perform”.

196. Thus, the Tribunal does not believe that “willingness to perform” is a
requirement of Force Majeure for the purposes of Article 22.2 of the PSAs.

197. A possible exception to this is the case if the Respondents establish that the
Claimants had already determined that they would not perform before the Force
Majeure events occurred. Indeed, if that were the case, the Claimants’
performance would be prevented not because of Force Majeure, but because of
other events that occurred prior to the occurrence of Force Majeure events. In
such circumstances, Force Majeure would not cause the non-performance (the

*? Tr.1069:5-14.

75

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 79 of 128

non-performance would pre-exist the occurrence of the Force Majeure events).

The Tribunal does not find this hypothetical situation to be present in this case.

Prior to the Force Majeure events in March 2011, the Tribunal does not believe

that the Claimants had manifested an intention not to perform. The PSAs

entered into force in March 2009. In 2009 and 2010, the Claimants performed
some of their obligations under the PSAs including setting up an office,
interacting with the Respondents and other authorities with respect to obtaining
and interpreting available data etc. Moreover, they paid bonuses amounting to

over US$ 9.112 million in those years. In 2011 too (or at least until March 2011),

the Claimants continued to act on their obligations under the PSAs,

corresponding with Fugro and Coral, preparing the tender documents etc.’ In
this year too they paid US$ 3.577 million as bonuses. The Fugro Reports of 24
March 2011 relied on by the Respondents in their submissions did not
recommend relinquishment of the Blocks. For Block 19, Fugro recommended
the acquisition of 920 lines of 2D and 450 kilometres of 3D.‘ For Block 28,
Fugro identified two possible areas of 2D seismic acquisition, one north in the
block and one south.'”® For Block 57, Fugro identified an array of 2D seismic
lines and places for potential wells but observed that an airborne magnetic and
gravity acquisition survey may be carried out first.'”° In these circumstances,
the Tribunal does not believe — and the Respondents have not established —
that prior to the commencement of Force Majeure event(s) in March 2011, the
Claimants had already decided that they would not perform.

198. The Tribunal is aware of the Respondents’ related argument that the Claimants’
non-performance was not caused by Force Majeure, but rather by a lack of
cooperation from Alkor and WDCPL, and their decision not to fund the work.177
As above, while “willingness to perform” is not a requirement under Article 22.2
of the PSAs, a possible exception to this rule is if the Claimants had already
determined that they would not perform before the Force Majeure events

173 The Tribunal is aware that the Respondents contest the adequacy of the Claimants’ performance of
their obligations under the PSAs. What is relevant for the present purpose however is only whether
until March 2011, the Claimants had determined that they would not perform their obligations under
the PSAs.

occurred. Thus, in order to succeed with their argument, the Respondents
would have to show that the disputes, if any, amongst the members of the
Claimants’ consortium were such that the Claimants were unwilling to perform
before March 2011. The Tribunal does not believe that this is the case. As seen
above, prior to the Force Majeure events in March 2011, the Claimants had not
manifested an intention not to perform. Further, at the time the amount to be
paid to Claimant 1 was approximately US$ 848,828,'” which is not a large
amount when compared with the total value of the obligations undertaken by the
Claimants under the PSAs. In any event, the amount was paid by January
2011, and further amounts were paid thereafter. '7°

For all these reasons, the Tribunal believes that the test of causation for the
purposes of Article 22.1 is that the Claimants must have been prevented from
performing their obligations under the PSAs because of Force Majeure events.
In the next section, the Tribunal proceeds to determine whether the Claimants
were so prevented from performing their obligations under the PSAs because of
Force Majeure events.

b. Cause of the Claimants’ non-performance

. The Tribunal recalls that under the PSAs, the Claimants were to reprocess

available seismic data, acquire new seismic data and drill exploratory wells. It is
not disputed that in order to fulfil their obligation to acquire new seismic data,
the Claimants would have to conduct a tendering process to select
subcontractors to carry out the seismic acquisition work. Further, the Claimants
would need to send their personnel on the ground to acquire seismic data, even
if the actual work would be done by the subcontractors.'®°

The Claimants contend that Force Majeure prevented the completion of the

tendering process and prevented any actual work on the ground related to

seismic data acquisition."*' The Tribunal need not consider both these
arguments. Whether the Tribunal finds that Force Majeure prevented the
Claimants from completing the tender process or whether it finds that Force
Majeure prevented the Claimants from sending their personnel to Yemen for
seismic data acquisition, the outcome would be the same — that Force Majeure
prevented the Claimants from performing their obligations in respect of
acquiring new seismic data. For the reasons mentioned below, the Tribunal has
found that Force Majeure prevented the Claimants from sending their personnel
on the ground in Yemen. In the circumstances, because it is not required to do
so, the Tribunal need not analyze the Parties’ submissions on the Claimants’
alleged inability to complete the tender process."®* The Parties arguments on
the Claimants’ inability to send personnel to acquire new seismic data are
analyzed below.

a) The Claimants’ position

The Claimants argue that for technical reasons, it would have been necessary
for them to have their personnel on the ground to supervise the acquisition of
new seismic data by the subcontractor.'®® However, the Travel Advisories
prevented them from sending personnel to Yemen. Besides, the other Force
Majeure events (i.e. riots, insurrection, and other causes) “created an
environment too dangerous even to try to initiate ground operations.”"™ Risk
mitigation measures would not have reduced the risks associated with ground
work to a level acceptable to the Claimants. In sum, the Claimants submit that
in view of the security situation, it would be appropriate to conclude that ground
operations could not be conducted.

Citing a number of incidents, the Claimants deny the Respondents’ submissions
that the Claimants could have used the air strip in Block 18 or the Mukalla
airport or port facilities for conducting their ground operations. According to the

-PHB §217. They do not contend that Force Majeure prevented the re-processing of existing data

but do claim that Force Majeure would have prevented them from drilling exploratory wells (C-PHB
§216).

Claimants, given the situation at the time, “it would have been too dangerous to
expose employees and valuable assets to the prevailing risks.”"®> Other oil
companies were of the same view. In fact, no other comparable exploration
company acquired new seismic data during March 2011 to February 2013."
. The Claimants deny the Respondents’ submission that airborne gravity
magnetic data gathering or remote sensing would have been an alternative to
seismic surveys on the ground. According to them, airborne surveys were
inappropriate for all the three Blocks.*®” Equally inappropriate for the Claimants
was the Respondents’ comparison with production companies like Canadian
Nexen. According to the Claimants, the security profile of production companies
is different from that of exploration companies.
The Claimants also deny the Respondents’ reliance on Mr. Bartholomew's
statements that new seismic data could be obtained. According to the Claimants,
these statements were diametrically opposed to other statements that had been
made by him at the relevant time. Further, the company Mr. Bartholomew worked for
at that time, “WesternGeco”, had not carried out any seismic operations in Yemen
since March 2011, and, in fact, suspended their operations when the security
situation deteriorated. Moreover, Mr. Wieser, who was Mr. Bartholomew's
superior at the time, explained in detail how seismic operations were
impossible at the time in Yemen.

b) Respondents’ position

The Respondents deny the Claimants’ submissions and point out that the
Claimants had not gotten to the stage of field operations. Since the Claimants
had not reached that point, it was not correct for them to invoke Force
Majeure."®® Moreover, even if the events alleged by the Claimants had
occurred, the correct remedy would have been for the Claimants to ask for more

time by way of an extension."

. In any event, the Respondents submit that the Claimants could have acquired

seismic data on the ground. They point to a number of oil companies that
acquired such data during the relevant period. MedcoEnergi for instance
acquired new 3D-seismic data in block 83 during 2011 and 2012 and moved the
equipment to block 82 to commence survey work there in 2013.'°° They also
note that between March 2011 and 13 February 2013, production was
interrupted only by pipeline explosions, which would not affect seismic
acquisition work. According to the Respondents, ‘if production could be
maintained [...] it was possible to acquire new seismic data too.”"*'

The Respondents rely on Mr. Bartholomew's expert report to deny the
Claimants’ submission that the workforce on the ground cannot be adequately
protected. According to them, teams on the ground can assist each other, and
the workforce can be protected as long as an adequate number of security
personnel are employed.

The Respondents oppose the Claimants’ submission that even if they would
have accepted one of the bids, the security situation would have prevented the
acquisition of seismic data and the drilling of wells. Simply because other
contractors served force majeure notice in the relevant period does not prove
that these activities could not be performed in the Claimants’ blocks. The
Claimants could have engaged the Yemen Geological Survey and Mineral
Resource Board to undertake field work, something which would not have
required the presence of the Claimants on the ground since it would be
conducted by Yemeni nationals. Further, conducting satellite imaging or a
gravity and magnetic survey would have required minimal presence in Yemen
and, being airborne, would be largely unaffected by the security issues on the
ground." Further, expat employees of Canadian Nexen and other companies
remained in Yemen at all material times.

Yemen from March 2011 to February 2013 prevented the Claimants from
sending their employees in Yemen, and therefore prevented the Claimants from
performing their obligations under the PSAs.
The Tribunal finds this to be the case. For the reasons mentioned above [§117],
the Tribunal has found that the security situation deteriorated substantially from
March 2011, and to an extent that could not be foreseen. The quality and
quantity of the security incidents in Yemen dramatically increased in the
relevant areas under consideration. The situation in Yemen at the time was one
in which, in the Claimants’ expert Mr. Johnston's words, the oil industry “draws
a line”:
“Yes, there is a lot of work done in dangerous places but if it is so
dangerous that the danger cannot be dealt with the properly [sic] and
mitigated substantially then people do not go in. It is when they have

almost no control and they are really placing their personnel at risk,
that is where the industry draws the line.”"®

. In the situation of social and tribal unrest, armed clashes, terrorist attacks, road

blockages, kidnappings and other security concerns, the Tribunal accepts that it
would not have been prudent for the Claimants to send their personnel to
Yemen. After all, at the time, the Indian government had issued two travel

advisories that Indian citizens should leave the country, '%*

and had put
evacuation measures in place.'®° Irrespective of whether or not these advisories
were binding on the Claimants, it remains that it would not have been prudent to
send personnel into Yemen at the very time the government advises its citizens
“to exit the country through whatever commercial means available”.'®° In fact,
some of Claimant 1’s employees even quoted the security situation to object against
travels to Yemen.’ Other employees in Yemen sought repatriation. One of the

subcontractors’ employees, Mr. Roy Chowdhury was kidnapped on 11

December 2011 on his way to scout the Blocks.’ Several operators
complained of risks to their personnel working on the ground, and the
reluctance of subcontractors to travel to oil exploration/production blocks due to
the insecure situation." A number of these issues were also discussed in the
meetings of the Yemeni Cabinet.2°° In light of these events, the Tribunal finds
that the Claimants could not be expected to send their personnel to Yemen to
acquire seismic data. In fact, it is arguable that had they done so, they would
have violated applicable Indian law,7°' and Sharia principles.

The Respondents argue that if the Claimants had adopted appropriate risk
mitigation tools, such as PRIAM (Project Risk Identification, Assessment and
Mitigation), they could have performed their obligations. This argument is
especially based on the expert report submitted by Mr. Lajtha. However, the
Tribunal notes that in his report, Mr. Lajtha does not testify that applying the
PRIAM methodology would have permitted Claimants to perform. Further, in his
second expert report, the Claimants’ expert, Mr. Wieser, using the PRIAM
methodology assessed whether seismic operations could have been made
possible by adopting risk mitigation measures. He concluded that “[t]he
prevailing risk levels over the relevant period lie outside the [Claimants’] risk
tolerance levels and risk mitigation measures would not have brought the
residual risk levels below the MEDIUMHIGH tolerance rating.””°° These findings
were not expressly and in any case not convincingly challenged in the
Respondents’ submissions or in their examination of Mr. Wieser. In these
circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to agree with the Respondents that
performance could have been made possible by adoption of risk mitigation
tools. Indeed, it appears that even by applying the tools suggested by the
Respondents, the Claimants would not have been able to perform.

The next argument advanced by the Respondents is that performance was not
impossible because the Claimants could have performed their obligations with

the assistance of the Yemeni military. Here too, the Tribunal is unable to agree.
From a review of the incidents that took place at the time, it appears to the
Tribunal that Yemeni military was not fully functional then. Problems plaguing
the military were the subject of several discussions of the Yemeni Cabinet.2%
Further, several companies complained about the military inaction or the
inability of the military to protect them.”° In fact, in some instances, the military
itself posed a threat to the operations of some companies in Yemen.”% In these
circumstances, the Tribunal cannot agree with the Respondents that the
Claimants should have approached the military for assistance in performing
their obligations, especially in circumstances where the Respondents have
themselves not indicated what assistance the military could have provided at
the time and even less made such an offer contemporaneously.

Relying on Mr. Bartholomew's testimony, the Respondents submit that it is
wrong for the Claimants to contend that new seismic data could not be
obtained. The Tribunal recalls that it is sufficient if the party relying on force
majeure establishes that it was prevented from performing its obligations “in a
practical way”.2°7 While Mr. Bartholomew is of the view that seismic operations

could be conducted, he also maintains that this would require “appropriate

logistical and security planning and support’,? which would come at a

substantial price.?°° For the reasons mentioned above [§159], the Tribunal has
found that the events that took place in Yemen during the relevant period were
unforeseeable. The Tribunal wonders whether it would be “practical” in that
sense and context to expect the Claimants to incur substantial additional
expenses to address risks that were not contemplated at the time that they
entered into the PSAs. In any event, it is not clear that even by employing the

are conducted securely in numerous high risk environments. This often requires considerably more

additional security measures suggested by the Respondents, the Claimants
would have been adequately able to protect their personnel, which results into
an impossibility that goes beyond the qualified “practical impossibility”. In fact,
the examples relied on by the Respondents relate to production blocks. The
security profile of exploration blocks is different from that of production
blocks,?"° not the least because while production is localized, seismic
acquisition camps have to move from place to place.”"' Further, even though
exploratory wells may be drilled at scattered locations in production blocks, this
too would not equate the security profile of production blocks to exploration
blocks. After all, such exploratory wells would be drilled within a production
block, and the block itself is likely to have a security infrastructure in place.?"
217. The Respondents also submit that the Claimants could have engaged the
Yemen Geological Survey and Mineral Resource Board to undertake “field
work”, and that they could have conducted satellite imaging or gravity and
magnetic surveys which would be unaffected by the security issues on the
ground.2"5 The Tribunal is unable to agree. It is not clear what is meant by “field

exploration and to production are different. MR STUDER: | am not a security expert. My sense
would be that the principles would be the same and the various different manners that you
implement those might change, you know, versus mobile versus fixed. THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but
when it comes to exploration it is not something which is stable, localised and remaining in the same
place. By definition they move. They move from one place to the other when you have some
exploration. MR STUDER: Yes. THE PRESIDENT: So it cannot be exactly the same process of

work” that the Yemen Geological Survey and Mineral Resource Board would
have been ready and able to perform and whether that work would have
satisfied the Claimants’ contractual obligations. As mentioned above, the
Claimants were to acquire seismic data. In order to do so, the Claimants would
have had to send their personnel to Yemen. It has not been sufficiently made
out how by conducting field work or other surveys the Claimants would have
fulfilled their PSA obligation to acquire seismic data. Further, no suggestion to
this effect appears to have been made by the Respondents at the relevant time.

. The other arguments advanced by the Respondents — that operations continued
on the ground in Yemen from 2011 to 2013, and that if production could be
maintained with all of its attendant logistical challenges, then it follows that it
was possible to acquire new seismic data too*’* — are equally unconvincing.
First, it is the Respondents’ own case that “[t]he security situation varies from
block to block and the alleged experiences of one operator in one block cannot
be equated with the likely experiences of a different operator in a different
block”.2"> Thus, the fact that operators of other blocks were able to conduct
ground operations would not, in and of itself, be sufficient to conclude that
ground operations could be conducted in the Blocks. Second, more importantly,
the Tribunal notes that in support of their argument, the Respondents cite
examples of ground operations in production blocks. Even if it is assumed that
ground operations did take place at the relevant time in these blocks, as above,
the security profile for production blocks is different from that of exploration
blocks. Merely because some ground operations took place in some production
blocks would not automatically mean that seismic data could be acquired in the
Blocks in question. In fact, the Tribunal recalls that no exploration company
(with the exception of Medco in one block in 2012) acquired new seismic data
after April 2011 until February 2013. No exploratory wells were drilled by
exploration companies after March 2011.?"° PEPA’s website too shows that no
major exploration or production activities took place between January 2011 and
17 March 2013.2”

. In sum, it does appear that the security situation in Yemen at the relevant time
had deteriorated to a level that the Claimants were prevented from sending their
personnel to Yemen to acquire new seismic data.

For the reasons mentioned above [§202], the Tribunal need not determine
whether the Claimants were prevented from completing the tendering process
because of Force Majeure. However, even if it were to consider the issue, it
would not lead to a different outcome. The Tribunal recalls that on 16 May 2011,
the Respondents instructed the Claimants to issue tenders in accordance with
the applicable tender laws.”"° Art. 8 of Ministerial Decree No.1 requires a
minimum of three tenders." On 21 August 2011, the Claimants requested
approval for tender documents in respect of Blocks 19 and 28.29 PEPA
confirmed its agreement for the Claimants to issue its invitation to tender on 24
August 2011.21 On 12 September 2011, the Claimants issued their invitation to
tender.22 Several companies advised the Claimants that they were unwilling to
tender because of the security situation.2% After several extensions, the
Claimants received only two bids per block (“Terraseis” and “Shiv-Vani” for
Block 19 and “Shiv-Vani” and “Alphageo” for Block 28). On 6 September 2012,
the Claimants advised PEPA that they had received only two bids for each
Block, which was insufficient according to the Ministerial Decree.?* No solution
was advanced by PEPA. In the circumstances, on reviewing the response
received from the subcontractors that the Claimants had approached, the
Tribunal believes that the security situation prevented the Claimants from
receiving the requisite number of tenders. In effect, the Tribunal believes that
Force Majeure prevented the successful completion of the Claimants’ obligation
to acquire new seismic data.

. The Tribunal is aware of the Respondents’ argument that Mr. Al Humaidy could
have dispensed with the three-bidder requirement. First, it has not been
established that the requirement could actually have been dispensed with.?”
However, even if this were possible, it would not further the Respondents’ case.
After all, the possibility of a waiver was not communicated to the Claimants at
the relevant time: in their communication of 16 May 2011 in which they
instructed the Claimants to issue tenders in accordance with the tender laws,
the Respondents did not indicate that they had the power to waive the three
bidder requirement.” In their letter of 6 September 2012 (i.e. after receipt of
insufficient bids despite several extensions), the Claimants pointed out that they
had received only two bids for each Block, which was inadequate according to
the Ministerial Decree which required “at least three technically and financially
competitive bidders.” They asked PEPA “to suggest and advice [them] for [their]
next course of action.”2?” In their response of 12 September 2012, the
Respondents did not mention PEPA’s powers to waive the three-bidder
requirement. Further, the possibility of a waiver would not alter the fact that a
number of subcontractors refused to bid because of the prevailing security
situation.

. The Tribunal is also aware of the Respondents’ argument that the Claimants

could have found more bidders to perform seismic work if they would have tried

harder. The Tribunal is unable to agree. First, it has not been cogently made out
that even if Claimants had tried harder, it would have led to more valid bids.

Second, on reviewing the record, it appears to the Tribunal that the Claimants

did make sufficient efforts to attract bidders. For instance, they replied to

queries raised by some of the bidders and extended the bid submission

deadlines on several occasions.

It is true for that for Block 57 no tenders were issued. However, this would not

affect the outcome either. As mentioned above, PEPA approved the tenders for

25 Mir. Lugman’s testimony on this point was not convincingly contested. See Lugman ER II, question

(‘Article (34) requires the Chairman to first analyse and evaluate whether the conditions for an

Blocks 19 and 28 in August 2011. Non-submission of a tender for Block 57 was
not raised at the time, or in subsequent correspondence. The Claimants’
witness Mr. Biswal testified that given the security situation and logistical issues
involved, the Claimants expected even less a response regarding Block 57,7”
and that the Claimants would first pursue Block 19 and then move the seismic
crew on to Block 57.”° It has not been established why the formal non-issuance
of a tender in Block 57 would alter the Force Majeure situation in the Block 57 in
Yemen, especially in circumstances where the Claimants’ personnel would be
required for seismic data acquisition, and where the Claimants had already
given several Force Majeure notices citing problems in going ahead with their
operations.”>

The Tribunal concludes that the Claimants were unable to send their personnel
to Yemen because of Force Majeure. As a result, they were unable to perform
their obligations under the PSAs. Their inability began in March 2011 and
continued at least until February 2013, when they issued their Notice of
Termination.

Is the Claimants’ Notice of Termination valid?

. Article 22.4 of the PSAs does not expressly provide a period of time following

the expiry of the six-month period of Force Majeure during which the notice of
termination is to be served. As was already pointed out, it merely says that if a
Force Majeure event “continues in effect for a period of six (6) months,
thereafter the CONTRACTOR shall have the option [...] to terminate its
obligations”. In their submissions, the Respondents contended that the right of
termination must be exercised promptly and that in February 2013 it was too
late for the Claimants to exercise a right of termination which had accrued at
least 11 months earlier.2*' By contrast, the Claimants submit that their
termination of the PSAs because of Force Majeure was “in time.” They submit

78 Biswal WS |, §21; Biswal WS II §16.
228 Tr 431 et seq. This appears to be aligned with industry practice. See Exh. C-116. See also Tr.768-

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 92 of 128

that Force Majeure occurred over a period of at least six months, and until
February 2013.

For the reasons mentioned above, the Tribunal believes that Force Majeure
event(s) occurred at the relevant locations over a period of six months
extending to February 2013. In the circumstances, the Tribunal need not
consider the Parties’ submissions on whether the Claimants’ termination was
declared in time. Indeed, Force Majeure would have accrued again and again
(the last six-month period being August 2012 to February 2013), with the
completion of each six-month period, until February 2013. The Claimants’ notice
of termination of 13 February 2013 was therefore after the last six-month period,
and “in time” for the purposes of Article 22.4 of the PSAs.

REIMBURSEMENT OF BONUSES
a. The Claimants’ position

The Claimants point out that despite the declaration of force majeure, they
made annual bonus payments to the Respondents of US$ 4.19 million. Article
22.1 of the PSAs merely obliged them to pay the amounts that were due. As the
PSAs were suspended during the time of Force Majeure, the payments made
by them never became due. As the Claimants were not obliged to make the
bonus payments but nevertheless made them, the Respondents should thus
reimburse the Claimants.”

The Claimants submit that the Respondents’ argument that the bonuses
accrued during a period in which the PSAs were in force is irrelevant. They
point out that Force Majeure extends the Exploration Periods, and therefore, the
longer the period during which Force Majeure lasts, the more bonuses
Respondents would earn, which was not correct. In sum, according to the
Claimants, bonuses cannot become due in periods of Force Majeure as it would
unjustly enrich the Respondents.”°

b. The Respondents’ position

229. The Respondents contend that the bonuses accrued during the period when the

23

nv

PSAs were in force. Even if the Claimants’ arguments were correct, the PSAs
were terminated with effect from April 2013, not any earlier date. As such, the
bonuses are not returnable now.

According to them, the effect of the Claimants’ declaration of Force Majeure did
not suspend the payment obligation, “it merely excuse[d] performance caused
thereby. That performance does not, on any view, extend to the obligation to
make bonus payments and the Claimants cite no authority for such a
proposition. No question of unjust enrichment arises.”*** They contend that the
fact that bonuses remain payable despite Force Majeure is consistent with the
fact that these sums are payable without any chance of redemption.

Finally, the Respondents submit that the Claimants are estopped from denying
that they were liable to make the bonus payments and/or are prevented by the
contractual requirements of good faith from claiming these sums. After all, the
Claimants did not exercise their right to terminate for 18 months, during which
time they acted as if they were performing the PSAs and bound by them. It
would be unfair to require the Respondents to reimburse the bonus payments
which were paid during this period because the Claimants chose to delay
exercising their alleged right to terminate. In effect, the Claimants were asking
the Respondents to pay the costs of the Claimants’ delay, which should not be
accepted.

c. Analysis

. The Tribunal recalls that at the time of signing the PSAs, the Claimants paid a

signature bonus of US$ 3.75 million to the Respondents.” Annual bonuses
amounting to US$ 2.095 million were paid in 2009 and in 2010.” No claim is
made in respect of these payments. The Claimants’ claim is limited to the
bonuses paid in 2011 and 2012, which collectively amount to US$ 4.19 million.

Article 7.2 of the PSAs states that:

“In addition to any non-recoverable costs and expenses provided for
in this Agreement or in the Accounting Procedures in Annex “F” of
this Agreement, the below-mentioned costs and expenses are not
recoverable from Cost Recovery Petroleum or otherwise under the
Agreement:

L..]
Bonuses paid to the STATE or to the MINISTRY.”

Article 9 of the PSAs provides that taxes and bonuses have to be paid at certain
specified intervals.

Art. 22.1 of the PSAs states that the Claimants are obliged to pay amounts that
are due:

“The non-performance or delay in performance by the MINISTRY or
the CONTRACTOR of any obligation under this Agreement other
than the obligation to pay any amounts due [...] shall be excused if,
and to the extent that, such non-performance or delay is caused by
Force Majeure.”

Article 22.4 of the PSAs provides that:

“L... the CONTRACTOR shall have the option [...] to terminate its

obligations [under the PSAs] without further liability of any kind

except for those payments accrued under this Agreement.”
. Thus, the Claimants were bound to pay bonuses under the PSAs (Article 9).
Once paid, these bonuses would not be recoverable under the PSAs (Article
7.2). Further, non-performance or delay in paying amounts due under the PSAs
would not be excused because of Force Majeure (Article 22.1). Finally, once the
PSAs are terminated there is “no further liability of any kind.”
The Claimants submit that they were not obliged to pay the bonuses, and hence
the Respondents should reimburse them. The Tribunal is unable to agree. As
seen above, the PSAs were validly terminated by 15 May 2013 at the latest.
The termination does not have — and the Claimants do not claim that it has —
any retrospective effect. Thus, until 2013, the PSAs were in full force and effect,
except those obligations which were suspended because of Force Majeure. The
Claimants’ Force Majeure declaration of April 2011 did not suspend all of their
obligations under the PSAs because of Force Majeure. Quite to the contrary,
Article 22.1 expressly provides that obligations to pay amounts due are not
suspended because of Force Majeure. Thus, until termination of the PSAs in

2013, the Claimants were obliged to pay the bonuses, which they did. By paying
the bonuses, the Claimants were merely complying with the contractual
obligations they voluntarily undertook in the PSAs. In the circumstances, the
Tribunal does not see any valid reason to require the Respondents to reimburse
monies to which they were legitimately entitled under the PSAs. Accordingly,
the claim is dismissed.

In dismissing the claim, the Tribunal is aware of the Claimants’ argument that
the Respondents will be “unjustly enriched” because the longer the period
during which the Force Majeure occurs, the more the bonuses the Respondents
would earn. The present dispute before the Tribunal concerns whether the
Claimants should be reimbursed for bonuses paid in 2011 and 2012. It is not a
case where bonuses have been paid for a considerable period of time because
the Force Majeure period keeps extending (whether because of one party or
otherwise), but never for a period of six months. Therefore, as it is not required
to resolve the dispute presently before it, the Tribunal does not consider the
Claimants’ argument. Indeed, the Claimants have not shown how (which
provisions of Yemeni law etc.) a (possible) difficulty in applying the clause in a
hypothetical scenario would operate to alter the existing provisions of the PSAs.

COUNTERCLAIMS

Procedural Background

At the outset, the Tribunal recalls the procedural history of the counterclaims as
under:

-{|n the Terms of Reference, the Respondents’ counterclaims were
reproduced as:

“58. The Respondents also ask the Tribunal to declare and/or
order as may be appropriate that:

a. The Claimants are in breach of the PSAs by failing to perform
all their obligations, inter alia: (i) their Minimum Work Obligation
for the First Exploration Period, as set out in Annex C; and/or (ii)
the work set out in their annual Work Programs and Budgets.

92

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 96 of 128

d. The Claimants are liable to pay damages to the Respondents
for breach of the PSAs in at least the amount of the 2011 Budget
(US$53.04m) and/or of the Minimum Expenditure obligation
(US$42m).

e. The Claimants are to pay interest on such damages for a
period and at a commercial rate to be assessed.

f. The Respondents are entitled to drawdown on the Standby
Letters of Credit issued in their favour by the International Bank of
Yemen.”

- On the basis of discussions with the Respondents during the hearing, the
Tribunal gave them the opportunity to amend their prayers for relief;

- On 19 September 2014, the Respondents submitted a “Note on Quantum”;

- In their reply of 26 September 2014, the Claimants contended that the claims
in the Respondents’ submission were “new claims” in the context of Article
23(4) of the ICC Rules, and were inadmissible;

- On 1 October 2014, the Tribunal requested the Respondents to comment on
the Claimants’ reply. In particular, the Respondents were directed to “state
their claims as they are now, namely how they wish to read the decision part
(‘dispositif’, “order’) of the Award”;

- On 8 October 2014, the Respondents submitted their “Reply to the
Claimants’ Submission dated 26 September 2014”, “set[ting] out [...] their
claims for damages as the Respondents would like them to appear in the
decision part of the award”. The Respondents sought the following relief:

2. The Respondents seek the following orders:

a) The Respondents are entitled to draw down on the SBLCs for
US$42million, pursuant to Article 2.1.4(b); and;

b) The Respondents are additionally entitled to damages for the
Claimants’ breach of the Minimum Work Obligation, which are to
be assessed as the cost of performance of the work, namely
[insert figure]; and/or

c) The Respondents are additionally entitled to damages for the
Claimants’ breach of obligation to perform the 2011 WP&Bs,
which are to be assessed as [insert figure].

4. In the alternative to the claims set out in paragraph 2, if the
Tribunal were to hold that Force Majeure intervened from 11
March 2011, then the Respondents seek an Award which states
that the Claimants were in breach of the PSAs by failing to
perform the work set out in the 2010 WP&Bs. It would follow that

93

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 97 of 128

the Claimants are liable to pay the Respondents the cost of
performing the 2010 WP&Bs. The claim is for US$111million (at
today's costs of acquiring new 2D seismic data) or US$32.46m
(the actual amount of the 2010 WP&Bs, net of paid bonuses and
taxes).”

- On 21 October 2014, the Tribunal advised the Parties that whether or not the
Respondents’ counterclaims were classified as “new” claims in the context of
Article 23(4) of the ICC Rules, what was necessary was that the Claimants
were given an opportunity to respond to the counterclaims. Accordingly, the
Tribunal gave the Claimants the opportunity to make submissions and/or
lead evidence on the Respondents’ counterclaims;

- On 10 November 2014, the Claimants filed their “Reply to Respondents’
Reply Note on Quantum” along with the fourth expert report of Mr. Lugman.
In their submission, the Claimants contended that they were not contesting
the admissibility of the Respondents’ claim for damages in respect of the
MWO or the WP&B. Rather, they were contesting (i) the Respondents’ claim
of US$ 147 million instead of the earlier amount of US$ 53.04 million; and,
(ii) the justification of the increase by reference of the concept of “value of
performance”,”°”

- On 11 November 2014, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it understood
that the Parties had completed their submissions in respect of the claims and
counterclaims. The Tribunal would request further input from the Parties if
necessary.

241. It follows from the above that the Respondents’ counterclaims to be decided by
the Tribunal are as under:

“Relief Sought

2. The Respondents seek the following orders:

4. In the alternative to the claims set out in paragraph 2, if the Tribunal
were to hold that Force Majeure intervened from 11 March 2011, then
the Respondents seek an Award which states that the Claimants were
in breach of the PSAs by failing to perform the work set out in the 2010
WP8Bs. It would follow that the Claimants are liable to pay the
Respondents the cost of performing the 2010 WP8Bs. The claim is for
US$111million (at today’s costs of acquiring new 2D seismic data) or
US$32.46m (the actual amount of the 2010 WP&Bs, net of paid
bonuses and taxes).”

. These counterclaims were framed somewhat differently in the Respondents’
PHB as under:
“223. Accordingly, the Tribunal is asked to:
]

[...

223.2. Hold that the Respondents are entitled to drawdown on the
SBLCs forthwith;

223.3. Hold that the Claimants were and are in breach of the PSAs by
their failure to perform the Minimum Work Obligation and/or the
WP8Bs;

223.4. Award the Respondents damages of US$147m (or such other
sum as the Tribunal may see fit, and inclusive of interest / damages
reflecting the date of performance as the Tribunal may see fit)

[-.]

2

It also appears that the Claimants do not object to the admissibility of the
Respondents’ claim for damages in respect of the MWO or the WP&B. Rather,
they contest the increase in the amounts claimed by the Respondents, as well
as the manner in which that increase has been calculated. The Claimants’
objections would have to be considered only in the event the Tribunal finds that
the counterclaims succeed on the merits. For the reasons given below, none of
the counterclaims succeed. Thus, the Tribunal need not analyze the Claimants’
admissibility objections.

95

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 99 of 128

2. Legal Framework

244. The Respondents rely on Articles 333 and 347 of the Yemeni Civil Code for
their counterclaim. These provisions state:

“A person who owes an obligation must perform it by specific
performance or compensate for its value, if specific performance was

not possible”.2°°

“If specific performance by the obligor is impossible, the judge will hold
him liable for compensation for non-performance unless the obligor
proves that the impossibility of performance arose due to a foreign
reason not attributed to him.”*°°

245. In addition, Article 351 of the Yemeni Civil Code which provides the rules
applicable to determine how damages are to be assessed is also relevant:

“If the amount of compensation was not agreed by contract or by law, it
shall be determined by the judge based on the ‘actual/tangible
damage’ suffered by the obligee, provided that the damage is a natural
consequence of nonperformance or delay in performance of the
obligation. The damage shall be considered a natural consequence if
the obligee was unable to reasonably mitigate its effects. If the damage
originated from a contract, the obligor who did not commit fraud or
gross negligence, would only be liable for damage which was
foreseeable at the time of contracting.”

24

o

. The Tribunal now proceeds to examine each of the counterclaims. In doing so,
the Tribunal is mindful that, for each counterclaim, the Respondents have to
show that an obligation exists, that the obligation has been breached, and that
the breach has caused damage.”

288 art. 333 of the Civil Code.
289 art. 347 of the Civil Code.

240 The Respondents agree. See “Issues of Yemeni Law/Construction of the PSAs” §14 (“In order to
claim damages for breach of contract under Yemeni law, the aggrieved party must demonstrate: (a)
the existence of a contract; (b) A breach of that contract; (c) Loss suffered as a result of that
breach"). See also Respondents “Overview Note” §17.3.

Analysis

a. Drawdown of the SBLCs

7. The Respondents alleged entitlement to drawdown on the SBLCs is set forth in
Art.2.1.4(b) of the PSAs:

“If, at the end of the First Exploration Period or the Second Exploration
Period or at the termination of this Agreement, the CONTRACTOR has
failed to fulfill its Minimum Work Obligation for the applicable period,
and neither the CONTRACTOR nor the bank under the applicable
Letter of Credit has paid the entire amount corresponding to the
amount of the applicable Letter of Credit (reduced as provided below),
then the MINISTRY shall be entitled to draw the amount of said Letter
of Credit against the bank in accordance with its terms.”

@

Thus, the Respondents are allegedly entitled to drawdown the SBLCs if the

Claimants have failed to perform the MWO at the end of the First Exploration

Period or at termination of the PSAs. In the absence of Force Majeure, the First

Exploration Period would have expired on 17 March 2013. However, as above,

the Tribunal has found that Force Majeure intervened in March 2011. Thus, the

Claimants’ obligations (at least in respect of acquiring new data and drilling

wells) were suspended.”*' Hence, the First Exploration Period was suspended

from March 2011 onwards. It effectively ended on 15 May 2013 at the latest (i.e.

90 days after the Claimants’ notice of termination of 13 February 2013). Thus,

the Respondents may be entitled to drawdown the SBLCs if they can establish

that the Claimants had failed to perform their MWO at the latest by 15 May

2013.

9. The MWO itself consists of three obligations: (i) reprocessing available data, (ii)
acquiring new 2D and 3D-seismic data, and (iii) drilling wells.“ Thus, in order
for the Respondents to succeed, they must establish that the Claimants have
not fulfilled these obligations by 15 May 2013 at the latest.

0. Article 22.1 of the PSAs (reproduced above) excuses the Claimants from

performance of their obligations if the non-performance is caused by Force

Majeure. For the reasons mentioned above, the Tribunal has concluded that the

Claimants were unable to fulfill their obligations in respect of acquiring new

Article 22.1 of the PSAs.
Exhs. C-1 - C-3, Article 1.36 and Annex C.

97

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 101 of 128

seismic data and, consequently, drilling of wells because of Force Majeure.
Thus, the Claimants are excused from performing these obligations from March
2011 onwards. Therefore, the Claimants’ obligations to acquire new seismic
data and drill wells were suspended as of March 2011. Their obligations being
so suspended, the Claimants could not have breached these obligations by 15
May 2013 when the First Exploration Period effectively ended. The
Respondents’ counterclaims in this respect are, therefore, rejected.

. The Claimants’ obligation to reprocess available data however, was not affected
by Force Majeure.” Thus, if the Respondents can establish that by 15 May
2013 at the latest, the Claimants had breached their obligation to reprocess
available data then the Respondents may be entitled to drawdown the SBLCs
insofar as the SBLCs relate to this obligation. The Parties’ arguments on this
issue are considered below.

Respondents’ Position

252. The Respondents submit that they complied with their obligations under the

PSAs by making all the data which they had been provided by previous
operators available to the Claimants at the databanks. To the extent that
such data was found to be lacking or of poor quality, that was a risk which
the Claimants assumed at the time of contracting. The Respondents did not
undertake to provide the data in any particular format. Nor did they guarantee

its extent.2*

253. The Respondents further submit that the Claimants already had most of the

available data for the Blocks prior to entering into the PSAs. The Claimants
would have reviewed the data before deciding whether to bid for the Blocks,
something which is also borne out from the fact that the Claimants’ prospectivity
reports for the Blocks prepared in March-June 2010 refer to missing and poor

43 C.PHB §216 (“Claimants’ case is that Force Majeure in the sense of Art. 22.2 of the PSAs
prevented the performance of 2D- and 3D seismic surveys and the drilling of exploratory wells in the
Blocks. Claimants’ case is not that Force Majeure prevented the first step of the PSAs’ MWO, the re-
processing of existing data. With regard to the MWO to reprocess existing data, Claimants’ case is
that performance was impossible because Respondents had not provided them with the necessary
original data and support files’).

quality data.2° In any event, once the PSAs were signed the Claimants could
have enquired with PEPA / the Ministry as regards any other available data in
relation to the blocks. The Claimants did not ask if any further data was
available and to what extent the data previously acquired was in a readable
format until February 2010.

The Respondents finally submit that it is wrong for the Claimants to contend that
reprocessing was not possible. The Respondents had supplied data which was
capable of being reprocessed. Even if this were not the case, the Respondents
point out that the Claimants’ inability to reprocess was not brought to the
Respondents’ attention. The Claimants had not produced a single study or
report that performance of the reprocessing obligation was impossible. As the
Claimants did not seek a variation of their PSA obligations, the obligation to
reprocess remained, and the Claimants’ failure to comply was a breach.

Claimants’ Position

. On their part, the Claimants contend that it was impossible to perform the
obligation to reprocess the available data.”“° They submit that the obligation to
reprocess “available data” attaches to original data only. The Claimants
received this data only on 17 October 2010, and it was impossible for them to
reprocess data before then. Even after that date, reprocessing was impossible.
For Block 19, the Respondents did not provide the Claimants with “all
supporting files” for the original data for the 27 lines supplied on 17 October
2010.24” Ms. Sileem, the Respondents’ expert, had herself testified that these
files were necessary for reprocessing. For Block 28, the reprocessable data
supplied by the Respondents was outside the Block boundaries. While some of
the data supplied fell within the Block, the Claimants submit that it would have
been “futile” to reprocess this data because it would not have generated useful
information.2“8 For Block 57, the Claimants point out that necessary relational

files were missing and this made it impossible for them to reprocess the
available data for that Block.

6. In sum, the Claimants submit that reprocessing was impossible for Blocks 19
and 57, whereas reprocessing would have been useless for Block 28. If
however, the Tribunal were to find otherwise, “then the Tribunal should find that
Claimants are in breach only to the extent original data were made available to
Claimants in relation to the far larger amount of objectively existing original

data, which Respondents did not make available to Claimants.’*“°

The Tribunal recalls that the Claimants were obliged to “reprocess available
seismic data” related to the Blocks. This “available seismic data” was to be
“made available” to the Claimants pursuant to Article 14.8 of the PSAs which
provides in this respect:

“All available technical data concerning the Agreement Area including
the geological, geophysical and drilling data and any rock or
hydrocarbon rock samples shall be made available to the
CONTRACTOR free of charge except of copying within thirty (30) Days
from the Effective Date.”

»250 to

8. Thus, the Respondents were to “make available” “available technical data

the Claimants, which the Claimants would then reprocess.
9. The Tribunal believes that in order to reprocess, the Claimants would need not
only the raw data, but also certain support files. As Mr. Biswal testified:

“Two things are necessary for reprocessing of seismic data: the raw
data and the support files. It is also important to have all the support
files. In this regard, Ms Sileem's expert report is not precise. The table
on page 27 lists many files which were provided for the 27 "Phillips"
lines (block 19). These include tape labels, final report vibroseis
seismic Survey, Preliminary test report, Dynamite report and recording
summary. But all of these are not support files. These accessory parts
are often called "Operational reports". They are helpful, but they are
not support files and you cannot do any reprocessing with them.

C-PHB §705.

The Parties contest the translation of the Arabic equivalent for the word “available” used in the
English version of Article 14.8. The Claimants submit that it means “existing”, while the
Respondents contend that it means “available”. For the reasons mentioned subsequently, the
Tribunal need not decide the issue. For the reasons mentioned subsequently, the Tribunal need not
decide the issue. For the sake of convenience, the Tribunal uses the word “available” although it
has not decided on the Parties’ opposing views on the issue.

100

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 104 of 128

Support files include the "Observer Logs" which Ms Sileem mentions in
paragraph 37.5. These support files were never provided to us for the
block 19 lines.””°"

26

S

This necessity of support files was also confirmed by the Claimants’ witness Mr.
Saha in his testimony:

“MR SAHA: Yes, we received the raw data only on 17 October 2010
and for confirmation which GSPC and DBDP also confirms that
whatever raw data we received for block 19 without support file, that
means reprocessing was not possible.”*°*

“MS SABBEN-CLARE: Now, | want to know how long it took you to
form the view that for some blocks, some lines at least, you did not
have the raw data that you would need to make reprocessing possible.
Did it take you a week, six months, a year? How long was it?

MR SAHA: | cannot understand your question because our
understanding was from the beginning we were saying that we need
raw data along with the support files.”

261.

=

In her written expert testimony, Ms. Sileem stated that:

“The recorded seismic data in the field is called Pre-Stack data, field
data and also called seismic traces. Their Identification records are
called Observer logs or trace headers. It is necessary to have both
complete data sets in order to process the Pre-Stack data.”**

26:

Nv

. Finally, Medco, another oil and gas company operating in Yemen also
established the need for support files:

“tlhe obstacle of reprocessing all seismic data is the lack of supporting
data i.e. observer report, navigation files and some are not complete
data record.”?°°

26

oe

Thus, it appears to the Tribunal that the Claimants could fulfill their obligation of
reprocessing “available seismic data” only if they had both, the raw data and the
support files. Both of these would have to be “made available” by the
Respondents, who own all the data in respect of any block in Yemen.°° The

258 Al] data obtained in respect of any block in Yemen is the property of the Ministry (SoD §94). The
Respondents have not substantially made out a case that the Claimants should have created the
support files themselves, or acquired them from other operators (if either of these were possible).

101

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 105 of 128

Claimants’ case is that it was “impossible’**’ to reprocess data for Blocks 19
and 57, and that it would be useless to reprocess data for Block 28.

264. For Block 19, it appears undisputed that there were 132 existing lines. Of these,
the Respondents’ expert explained that 27 seismic lines were provided to the
Claimants. Thus, the Claimants’ reprocessing obligation could have been
performed only in respect of these 27 lines. However, as above, reprocessing of
raw data is not possible in the absence of support files. On reviewing the
evidence supplied by the Respondents, it appears that necessary support files
were missing.” For instance “Observer Logs” — which Ms. Sileem submitted
were needed® — were missing.“ Thus, reprocessing was not possible in
respect of Block 19.

265. The Tribunal is aware that in the course of her examination, Ms. Sileem stated
that it would have been possible to reprocess the original data for Block 19
based on the information contained in processed data and shot point location
maps that were supplied to the Claimants in 2006. The Tribunal is not
convinced by this testimony. First, Ms. Sileem relied on lists provided to her by
the Respondents," and only speculated that the relevant maps were actually
provided to the Claimants.2°? Second, in her written testimony filed months prior
to the hearing (and without the benefit of the Claimants’ Rejoinder on the
Counterclaim in which they emphasized the necessity of the relevant support
files), she did not mention anything about using other information as a substitute
for the support files. As above, her written testimony prior to the hearing was

categorical. Even more so, Medco, an independent operator, also largely came
to the same conclusion as she did in her original testimony.

For Block 28, it appears undisputed that there were 43 existing lines. Of these,
the Respondents’ expert explained that 30 seismic lines were provided to the
Claimants. Thus, the Claimants’ reprocessing obligation could have been
performed only in respect of these 30 lines. However, as above, reprocessing of
the original raw data is not possible in the absence of support files. On
reviewing the evidence supplied by the Respondents, it appears that support
files were missing for 27 lines.”°* Thus, reprocessing would be possible only in
respect of three lines for which support files were present. However, the
Respondents have not (expressly) challenged that of these three lines, one was
outside the Block and the other two were partially within the Block boundaries
(approximately 15 km). Further, the Respondents do not appear to dispute the
Claimants’ submission that there is no obligation to reprocess one line within
the block because 2D seismic acquisition means that a grid is created and with
one line you cannot create a grid. In his testimony, Mr. Biswal stated that it
would not have been useful to reprocess the limited data in respect of Block 28:

“The 3 remaining lines of block 28 were not relevant. They were mostly
outside the block area, as can be seen from the illustration below. One
line was completely outside and one hardly reached into the block.
Only the third and shortest line was to the majority inside the block:

Therefore the reprocessing and interpretation of these lines would

have not provided much information for us. 2D seismic lines are shot in

a grid. If you have several lines in a grid, you have two dimensions. If

you do not have a grid, you cannot visualise the subsurface feature of

the area.”

Mr. Biswal stated that reprocessing the few lines available in Block 28 would not

be useful. Effectively, if the reprocessing was meant to serve an economic

process, namely to collect useful information from the available data for the

Block, reprocessing was impossible because it would not achieve that.

. This testimony was not challenged by the Respondents. Besides, neither have
the Respondents established the loss suffered by them as a result of the

283 Rej. §60(a), Exh. R-134.

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 107 of 128

Claimants’ non-processing of approximately 15 km of seismic lines. In the
circumstances, the Respondents’ claims in respect of Block 28 are rejected.
269. For Block 57, it appears undisputed that five seismic lines (out of a total of five
lines) were provided to the Claimants. Thus, the Claimants could have
reprocessed all five lines. However, as above, reprocessing of the original data
is possible only if necessary support files are also present. It appears that
necessary support files (“relational files” or “.x files”) were missing. The
Claimants’ witnesses, Mr. Biswal and Mr. Saha testified that this was the case:

“Finally with regard to the 5 lines of block 57, it is correct that we
received support files. But these were not complete. When we checked
the data, we discovered that the relational files were missing.

Without the support files, the raw data cannot be processed.”*©

“With regard to block 57, the support files of those fi ive. lines were not
complete because the relationship files were missing.”

270. This testimony was not challenged at the hearing. Neither was Mr. Saha’s

meeting the Claimants’ case that it was not possible for them to perform their
obligation to reprocess available seismic data in respect of Block 57, this
counterclaim is also denied.

provided to the Claimants. The Tribunal believes that it need not resolve this
issue. What is relevant for the present purposes is that necessary support files
were missing, which rendered it impossible for the Claimants to fulfill their
reprocessing obligations.”

273. The Respondents have also pointed out that the Claimants did not mention their
alleged impossibility to perform their reprocessing obligations. The Tribunal is
unable to agree with the Respondents’ position. First, in the Exploration
Advisory Committee meeting of 20 March 2010, the Claimants mentioned that
the minimum commitment of US$ 500,000 per Block towards reprocessing
available data “may not be utilized in full due to lack of data availability and
should be allowed for substitution”.”° Further, in their communication of 22
June 2010, the Claimants advised PEPA that without supporting documents
and processing reports, “reprocessing of the seismic data may not be
possible.’2”' The matter was then apparently not raised by either Party until 18
February 2012 when the Exploration Advisory Committee sought the Claimants’
explanation on “re-processing previous information’.””? The Claimants

responded on 17 March 2012 stating that the available seismic data was of

“very poor quality’. They further indicated that they would discuss with PEPA

“about relevance of reprocessing of existing data’.?’”* In these circumstances,

the Respondents seem to have been on notice since at least March 2010 that

the Claimants may be unable to fulfill their reprocessing obligation. Second,
even if it is assumed that the Claimants did not timely advise the Respondents
of their inability to perform their reprocessing obligation, it would not alter the
outcome. Indeed, in the absence of support files, the Claimants’ obligation to

28° The Respondents do not appear to contest this position, at least in so far as the Claimants would
not be able to perform their reprocessing obligation in the event that the necessary supporting files
are missing: (“The Claimants were obliged to reprocess “available” data. If there were only 5 lines
with full supporting files, and if full supporting files were needed in order to be able to reprocess
data, both as they now allege, then it follows that there was no content to this PSA obligation.”). See
also Tr.91:16-18 (“Thus if they did not have the requisite data, then they did not have to do
anything.”).

reprocess was impossible, and the Claimants cannot be said to have breached

such an obligation. This seems to be the Respondents’ position as well,2”

b. Failure to perform the MWO

274. The Minimum Work Obligation was to be performed by the end of the First

27

a

Exploration Period.” For the reasons mentioned above [§248], the Tribunal
has found that the First Exploration Period was suspended from March 2011
onwards. It effectively ended by 15 May 2013 at the latest (i.e. 90 days after the
Claimants’ notice of termination of 13 February 2013). Therefore, in order to
succeed on their counterclaim, the Respondents would have to show that (a)
the Claimants were under an obligation to perform their MWO at the latest by 15
May 2013; and (b) that they had failed to do so.

. As mentioned above, the MWO itself was composed of three obligations: (i) the
reprocessing of available data, (ii) the acquisition of new 2D and 3D-seismic
data and (iii) the drilling of wells. The Claimants could not have been in breach
of items (ii) and (iii) because of Force Majeure. In respect of item (i), ie. the
obligation to reprocess available data, the Tribunal has already found that the
Claimants were unable to fulfill this obligation. Thus, even if the Respondents
were to establish that the Claimants were under an obligation to perform their
MWO at the latest, by 15 May 2013, they would, in any event, not succeed in
establishing that the Claimants had breached such an obligation.

276. In the circumstances, the Tribunal rejects the Respondents’ counterclaim in so

far as it relates to the Claimants’ alleged non-performance of its Minimum Work
Obligation.

277. The Tribunal notes that the Respondents have also submitted that the

Claimants are in breach of their obligations under the PSAs “to take steps so
that the Minimum Work Obligation could be completed by the end of the First
Exploration Period”. The Tribunal is unable to agree. As mentioned above,

274 Tr 1464-5 ("{i]f your view is no support files, no reprocessing and you do not get any support files,

and you are told by PEPA in no uncertain terms there is no more to come, then you know then that
there is no reprocessing that you can do. Moreover, that does not put you in breach of the PSAs
there is just no PSA reprocessing obligation. The PSAs require you to reprocess available data.").

the MWO is to be performed by the end of the First Exploration Period. There is
no obligation — and the Respondents have not cogently submitted to the
contrary — that the PSAs require certain steps to be taken towards fulfillment of
the MWO, and especially that such steps would have to be taken prior to March
2011, when Force Majeure prevented performance of at least some of the
Claimants’ obligations.

278. The Tribunal also notes the Respondents’ submission that “the Claimants

delayed fulfilment of their contractual obligations and adopted such a
haphazard approach to performance that (by April 2011 when they declared
Force Majeure) they had put themselves in a position in which it had become
impossible for them to fulfill their minimum obligations whether in the years to
which they had committed in the WP&Bs or by the end of the First Exploration
Period.”*”” The Tribunal is unable to agree. After all, the Respondents’ case is
that the 2011 and 2012 WP&Bs as submitted by the Claimants would have
been approved. If this is the case, then it would appear that the Respondents
too believed that it was possible for the Claimants to fulfill their obligations by
the end of the First Exploration Period. The Respondents have the burden of
proof on this issue of alleged impossibility for the Claimants to fulfill their
minimum obligations by the end of the First Exploration Period. Nothing in the
record convincingly establishes that.2”° For instance, the Respondents do not
establish how time of performance was an essential part of the PSAs, especially
in circumstances where the PSAs themselves provide that the Claimants can
‘elect’ to enter into extensions, which extensions “shall not be unreasonably
withheld”2”° and where such extensions were granted to other operators in what
appear to be similar circumstances.%° The Respondents thus resort to
analyzing their own state of mind in respect of their prospective approval of the
WP8Bs,2"" which is insufficient. The Respondents’ reservations in this respect

do not appear to have been communicated contemporaneously to the
Claimants. Neither have the Respondents established the actual loss they
suffered by the Claimants’ alleged delay in fulfillment of their contractual
obligations. The Tribunal also notes that no specific damages are sought in
respect of this claim.2

c. Failure to perform the WP&Bs

. The Respondents submit that “[t]he Claimants were in breach of the obligation
to perform the [WP&Bs], not “just” of the obligation to performance of the
Minimum Work Obligation. Accordingly [...], there would still be a separate
damages claim for breach of the obligation to perform the WP&Bs”.”* As
above, the Tribunal has found that Force Majeure prevented the performance of
the Claimants’ obligations from March 2011. In these circumstances, the
Tribunal would have to decide the Respondents’ counterclaims in respect of
only the 2010 WP&Bs.24 The Parties’ submissions are considered below.

Respondents’ Position

280. The Respondents submit that the words used in the PSAs, especially in Articles
4.3. and 4.4 thereof should lead the Tribunal to conclude that the Claimants
must perform the WP&Bs. Their contention is not that WP&Bs are in
themselves contracts, or that the WP&Bs varied the PSA terms. Rather, their
submission is principally that once approved under Article 4.3 of the PSAs, the
WP8Bs must be performed and that the PSAs, by their own terms, require the

 

has always been to assume the validity of the timescales advanced in the WP&Bs and to approve

these documents in order to enable the Claimants to proceed with performance as soon as possible.

Any such approval would accordingly have been granted on the basis of an assumption that the

therein were and, in the event that the Claimants

their to perform , in any event i In no way does the

hypothetical approval of the 2011 WP&B amount to an acknowledgement either that performance by
March 2013 was possible and/or that the Claimants were not already in breach’).

24 See “Reply to the Claimants’ ission dated 26 2014” (“In the alternative to the
claims set out in paragraph 2, if the Tribunal were to hold that Force Majeure intervened from 11
March 2011, then the Respondents seek an Award which states that the Claimants were in breach
of the PSAs by failing to perform the work set out in the 2010 WP&Bs’).

Contractor to perform the WP8Bs.”" They point out that in case of any
ambiguity, Article 212 of the Yemeni Civil Code applies, which means that the
PSAs should be given a “commercial commonsense meaning”.”°°

. The Respondents further submit that the approved WP&Bs define the content
of the Minimum Work Obligation and Minimum Expenditure Obligation for the
ensuing year. The First Exploration Period is apportioned in time, and the
obligations under the WP&Bs are owed in respect of each apportioned period.
They therefore disagree with the Claimants’ submission that their obligation is
to complete the MWO by the end of the First Exploration Period. If that were
the case, then it would mean that the Claimants could postpone their
obligations at a higher cost, and then recover that greater sum from the
Respondents. This could not have been the intention of the Parties at the time
of contracting.”°”

. The Respondents also disagree with the Claimants that the WP&Bs only have a
“price tag” function. They submit that the provision is for work programs and
budgets — not merely work budgets, which is the price tag element.°

Claimants’ Position

283. On their part, the Claimants contend that the WP&Bs do not create any

performance obligations in addition to the MWO.”*° According to them, none of
the PSA provisions relied on by the Respondents actually support the
Respondents’ case. They point out that the Respondents’ claim is that the
WP&Bs contain additional obligations that can be separately breached.
However, Art. 18.2 of the PSAs limits the obligations of the Claimants to the
PSAs. Further, Art. 30.2 of the PSAs contains an “Entire Agreement” provision
according to which the PSAs can be modified only by written agreement, which
also has to be ratified as a law. None of the WP&Bs was ratified as law.°°

4. The Claimants further submit that the WP&Bs do not create additional
obligations because their purpose is to monitor the activities of a contractor and
to enable the Respondents to limit the expenditure of the contractor so to limit

the contractor's ability to claim expenses in case of a commercial discovery.”*"

a

The Claimants’ next submission is that the Respondents’ own position is that
the annual WP&Bs supersede each other. If this is so, then it is contrary for the
Respondents to claim a breach of the 2010 WP&Bs because the Respondents
themselves claim that the 2011 WP&Bs would have been approved. The 2011
WP&Bs would supersede the 2010 WP&Bs. They also submit that between the
end of 2010, i.e. when Claimants were purportedly in breach of the 2010
WP&8Bs, and April 2011, when Force Majeure intervened, Respondents never
warned Claimants that they had not performed the 2010 WP&Bs.7°

Finally, the Claimants submit that under Art. 22.4 of the PSAs, in order to claim

a

damages, the Respondents would have “to show that their damages claim for
non-performance of the 2010 WPB has accrued (i) by the time termination was
declared and (ii) under [the PSAs].” As the Respondents’ claim did not meet any
of these conditions, it ought to be rejected. -

Analysis

7. As mentioned above [§246], for each of the counterclaims, the Respondents
have to establish that an obligation exists, that the obligation has been
breached, and that the breach has caused damage. The first step is therefore to
establish that there was an obligation i.e. each WP&B individually created a
binding obligation on the Claimants. The Parties seem to agree that this is an
issue of construction of the PSAs and that Yemeni law does not include any
relevant rules.7

which the CONTRACTOR proposes to carry out during the ensuing
Year. During each Exploration Period or extension, such Work
Programs and Budgets taken together shall be at least sufficient to
satisfy the CONTRACTOR’s Minimum Work Obligation and Minimum
Expenditure Obligation for the period it covers, taking into account any
credits for excess work previously carried out by the CONTRACTOR in
prior portions of the Exploration Period.”

. Article 4.3 provides that once approved by the Ministry, the WP&Bs cannot be
modified:

“Following review by the Exploration Advisory Committee, the
CONTRACTOR shall make such revisions as it thinks appropriate and
submit the Exploration Work Program and Budget to the Ministry for its
approval. Following such approval, the CONTRACTOR shall not
substantially revise or modify the Work Program and Budget without
the approval of the Ministry.”

293. It goes on to say that:

“Following such approval [by the Ministry], it is further agreed that:
CONTRACTOR shall neither substantially revise or modify said
Exploration Work Program and Budget nor reduce the approved
budgeted expenditure without the approval of the MINISTRY.”

294. Article 4.4 of the PSAs provides:

“The CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for the preparation and
performance of the Exploration Work Program and Budget which shall
be implemented in a workmanlike manner [...].”

29:

a

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 4.1(c), the Claimants were entitled to withdraw
from the PSAs before the end of the First Exploration Period provided that they
had “fulfilled the Minimum Work Obligation for the applicable period in effect at

111

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 115 of 128

the time of withdrawal”. Pursuant to Article 4.1(d), excess work in any portion of
the Exploration Period “may be carried forward to satisfy the work in a
subsequent portion of the Exploration Period”.

296. The Respondents effectively contend that the WP&Bs create binding
obligations, which the Claimants oppose.

297. The Tribunal believes that none of the provisions extracted above provide either
individually or even together that the WP&Bs themselves create an annual
binding obligation. Articles 4.2. and 4.3 of the PSAs merely require the
Contractor i.e. the Claimants to prepare and submit the WP&Bs. They do not
provide that the obligations (voluntarily®>) undertaken by the Claimants in the
WP8Bs create binding obligations that would sound in damages unless there is
a failure to meet the MWO at the end of the First Exploration Period. When the
Parties wished to impose binding obligations on each other, they used clear
language to do so. For instance, Article 4.1 of the PSAs provides that “the
Contractor agrees and commits to undertake in the Agreement Area during the
Exploration Period a program of Exploration work as Minimum Work Obligation
as set out in Annex C [...]’.The Parties also limited their obligations to those
under the PSAs.2°° As the express terms of the PSAs do not specify that the
WP8Bs are binding in nature, the Tribunal cannot impose such obligations on
the Claimants.

298. Further, as above, Article 4.4 of the PSAs merely provides that the Claimants
“shall be responsible for the preparation and performance of the Exploration
Work Program and Budget.” Exploration Work Program and Budget is defined
in Article 1.28 to mean “Work Program and Budget for Exploration as defined in
Article 4 and described in Annex C.” Article 4 is titled “WORK PROGRAM(S)
AND BUDGET(S) FOR THE EXPLORATION PERIOD.” “Exploration Period”
refers to the First Exploration Period of four years, which, ordinarily would have
ended on 17 March 2013. It does not contemplate an annual breakdown of the
Claimants’ obligations under the PSAs. Annex C — which is also referred to in
Article 4.4 of the PSAs — contains the MWO only. It too does not contain a year-
by-year breakdown of the MWO. Further, Article 4.3 provides that the Claimants

= Subject to compliance with the Minimum Work Obligation (Annex C, Article 1.2) and Minimum
Expenditure Obligation (Annex C, Article 1.3).
2° article 18.2 of the PSAs.

112

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 116 of 128

are to prepare a WP&B, “setting forth the Exploration operations which the
[they] propose to carry out during the ensuing Year.” It states that the WP&Bs
taken together shall be at least sufficient to satisfy the MWO. The WP&Bs are
thus meant to be proposals, and all such proposals, which shall be approved by
the Respondents and then not be amended unless the Parties agree, taken
together, should be sufficient to meet the MWO. The Tribunal does not find in
these provisions any requirement that the WP&Bs taken individually contain
binding obligations. Rather, these provisions seem to indicate that the annual
WP&Bs must collectively lead up to the MWO, which, under the PSAs must be
fulfilled by the end of the First Exploration Period. The PSAs use non-
ambiguous wording: “the CONTRACTOR agrees and commits to undertake [...]
a Minimum Work Obligation [...] [which] should be fulfilled notwithstanding the
Minimum Expenditure Obligation.”°” The WP&Bs serve to break down the
performance of such Exploration obligations year on year but the PSAs do not
provide for any specific consequences if they should not be fulfilled: the failure
to fulfill will only expose the Claimants to pay the shortfall in Minimum Work
Obligation or Minimum Expenditure Obligation at the end of the concerned
Exploration Period.2°

299. The Tribunal finds some additional support for this view in Article 4.1(c) of the
PSAs, which specifies the Claimants’ obligations in respect of the Second
Exploration Period: “[a]ny shortfall in aggregate Exploration expenditure by the
end of the Second Exploration Period [...] shall oblige the CONTRACTOR to
pay the amount of such shortfall to the MINISTRY.” What is contemplated here
is a shortfall at the end of the Second Exploration Period. The provision does
not contemplate a scenario where amounts promised to be spent in one year
are not spent. Rather, what it does is contemplate that all amounts spent during
the Second Exploration Period are to be totaled at the end of the Second
Exploration Period, and, if those amounts are found to be less than amounts
promised to be spent under the PSAs, then the Claimants are to make up the
shortfall. The accounting is done at the end of the PSAs, and not on a year-on-
year basis. To the Tribunal this indicates that no obligations are owed on an

So

annual basis, rather what is relevant is that at the end of the Exploration Period
what has been promised is done.

. The first part of Article 4.1(c) also supports this view. It provides that in case of

withdrawal within the First Exploration Period (which terminates the PSAs), the
Contractor must pay to the Ministry the difference between the Minimum
Expenditure Obligation and the amounts expended until the time of withdrawal.
This means that at the termination of the PSAs because of the Claimants’
withdrawal, amounts spent during the First Exploration Period are added, and if
that sum is less than the Minimum Expenditure Obligation, then the shortfall has
to be made up. The accounting is done at the end of the PSAs, and not on a
year-on-year basis and not on the basis of WP&Bs. The WP&Bs appear to be
prospective instruments to define what the Claimants intend to do on the field
and allow both Parties to monitor the actual performance; the Respondents
must supply their acceptance, given the consequences if the forecast amounts
are actually spent (repayment of the Claimants when oil is produced). The
WP&8Bs are not meant to operate as supplemental minimum expenditure or
work obligations with the strict monetary lumpsum penalties attached to shortfall
in their performance: such strict consequences would definitely have been
clearly, in fact expressly, stipulated in the PSAs. To the Tribunal, this too
indicates that no obligations are owed on an annual basis. Rather, all
accounting is to be done at the end of the PSAs (or the end of the relevant
Exploration Periods). Although they serve a different purpose, namely to define
on a year by year what the Claimants will do by way of Exploration work and
what expenses they may recoup when oil is produced, the WP&Bs also help to
keep check that the Contractor is on track to fulfill the MWO, but do not impose
annual binding obligations.

. The Tribunal notes that the Respondents cite Article 4.1(c) in support of their

arguments because the provision uses the word “applicable period”.2 The
Tribunal is unable to agree. When read in context, it is clear that the words
“applicable period” in Article 4.1(c) refer to the First Exploration Period or any
extensions thereto, and not period within the First Exploration Period.

302. To the Tribunal, the terms of the PSAs are clear in that they do not impose any
obligations on the Claimants in addition to the MWO (and MEO). In any event,
even if the Respondents’ case that the provisions are ambiguous is adopted, it
would not lead to a different outcome. Indeed, in cases of ambiguity, the
Respondents argue that the relevant provisions should be given a “commercial
commonsense meaning’.°” The Tribunal recalls Mr. Johnston’s uncontroverted
testimony of the use of WP&Bs in the oil and gas industry:

“Furthermore, | understand that the Respondents argue that the WPBs
create binding obligations of the Contractor to perform the tasks
outlined in the Work Programs in each of the given budget periods — as
if these constitute a separate agreement or amendment of the
contractual PSA obligations. During the past 33 years that | have
worked in the international sector of the petroleum industry on projects
all around the globe, | have never heard of this kind of interpretation
before. Therefore this interpretation is definitely a contradiction to the
global practice in the oil and gas industry in my experience.”**"

“The budget process is for planning purposes and to allow the state a
forum in which to oversee and control, to a certain extent, the technical
direction of the petroleum operations and to protect the state from over
expenditure. This will ensure that the state will be protected from
excess cost recovery when production begins. This issue regarding
costs is one of the greatest concerns that governments have; over
expenditure, goldplating, transfer pricing or non-arms-length acquisition
of goods and services.”*°?

303. Mr. Luqman too supported this view,°° which the Tribunal believes is correct. A
budget, per se, is always an estimate. Here, it is Claimants who prepare the
WP8Bs. Their obligations are to make sure that the WP&Bs are at least
sufficient to satisfy the Minimum Work Obligation.°™ Thus, if the Claimants had
to pay for the failure to meet the WB&Ps would they not be tempted to limit
them to the minimum and do more on the field, which cannot be correct? What
is more appropriate is that the annual work plans and budgets chart out how a
contractor proposes to fulfill its overall obligations within the stipulated period. If
it is unable to fulfill its obligations at the end of the period in question, then it can
be said to be in breach of the applicable contractual provisions. Until that time

however, the contractor is free to organize itself in the manner that it deems fit.
The Respondents themselves appear to have accepted this position.°°

304. The Tribunal believes that the principal purpose of the WP&Bs is that they
assist in determining the amount the Claimants can recover once oil has been
discovered. Exploration Expenditures incurred by the Claimants during the
Exploration Phase are to be taken into account during the Production Phase, if
any. The WP&Bs fix the value Claimants may recover during the Production
Phase, thereby avoiding disputes over the (recoverable) value of the works
performed prior to the discovery of oil.°°°

305. The Parties’ performance of the PSAs also supports the view that the WP&Bs
do not impose binding obligations. Article 4 of the PSAs does not provide a
specific time at which the WP&Bs are to be approved. If the WP&Bs were to set
out the binding obligations to be fulfilled by the Claimants on a year on year
basis, then it would be reasonable to expect that they would be agreed prior to
the commencement of the year. However, discussions on the 2011 WP&B
continued well into 2012.°” It is counterintuitive to suggest that the Claimants
would know of their binding obligations for a year only after the year had
passed. Moreover, in 2010, the Respondents requested a reduction in the
WP8B submitted by the Claimants for that year from US$ 68.24 million to US$
35.5 million. If, as the Respondents contend, the Claimants were obliged to
perform the WP&Bs in the sense that a specific compensation would be
payable in case of breach, it would have been in the Respondents’ interest to
approve the WP&Bs as originally submitted, rather than require a reduction of
US$ 30 million. The fact that the Respondents required the reduction is further
evidence that the WP&Bs did not impose binding obligations. Rather, as
mentioned above, the WP&Bs merely set out the amounts that could be
recovered in case of a discovery of oil. Finally, the Tribunal notes that most of
the activities that the Claimants were to perform under the 2010 WP&Bs were

95 Tr 429-130 ("MS SABBEN-CLARE: [...] It might be helpful just to clarify that | do accept that year
‘on year the work programs and budgets supersede each other. So what | cannot do is add up 2010
and 2011 and say you are in breach of both because in 2011 there was agreement about the cost of
all the work that was going to be performed in 2011, which included in large part everything that
should have been performed in 2010. There is a rollover. Each work program and budget becomes
historical once you are into the next year.”).

8 The Respondents appear to agree. See Answer fn.5.

°°” See, for example, Exh. R-20.

116

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 120 of 128

repeated in the 2011 WP&Bs (which the Respondents say they would have
approved). It would be contrary to the PSA requirement of good faith if a Party
were to approve that certain activities be carried out in a coming year and
then also claim damages because they were not carried out in preceding year.

306. The Tribunal believes that the counterclaim fails for another reason as well.

Article 22.4 of the PSAs provides that if the PSAs are terminated under their
terms, the termination is ‘without further liability of any kind except for those
payments accrued under this Agreement.” For the reasons mentioned above,
the PSAs were validly terminated. Thus, the Respondents would have to show
that their damages claim for non-performance of the 2010 WP&Bs has accrued
under “this Agreement’ by the time of termination. However, the
Respondents have themselves submitted that the WP&Bs supersede each
other. Thus, the 2010 WB&P would have been substituted by the 2011
WP8B. If this is so — and especially because the Respondents contend that the
2011 and 2012 WP&Bs would have been approved*"° (effectively substituting
the 2010 WP&Bs) — then it cannot be the case that the damages claim for non-
performance of the 2010 WP&Bs had accrued at the time of termination in
2013. Indeed, on the Respondents’ own argument, the 2010 WP&Bs would
have been substituted by the 2011 and 2012 WP&B once approved (which the
Respondents contend that it would have been).

307. In the circumstances, the Tribunal rejects the counterclaim in respect of the

2010 WP&Bs.

308. For the reasons mentioned above, the Tribunal has found that the WP&Bs do

not impose any binding obligations on the Claimants. Thus, the counterclaims in
respect of the 2009, 2011 or 2012 WP&Bs — to the extent they are still

maintained®"" — are also rejected.

%°8 Article 1.2 defines “Agreement” as “Agreement shall mean this production sharing agreement and

the attached Annexes”.
909 Tr 429 et seq.(‘MS SABBEN-CLARE: [...] It might be helpful just to clarify that | do accept that year

on year the work programmes and budgets supersede each other. So what | cannot do is add up
2010 and 2011 and say you are in breach of both because in 2011 there was agreement about the
cost of all the work that was going to be performed in 2011, which included in large part everything
that should have been performed in 2010. There is a rollover. Each work programme and budget
becomes historical once you are into the next year.”).

309. The Tribunal notes that the Respondents have also submitted that because by

31

31

o

2009, the Claimants had not (i) signed the Joint Operating Agreement, (ii)
appointed a General Manager, (iii) opened an office, (iii) performed an
Environmental Impact assessment, the Claimants had breached the relevant
provisions of the PSAs. As seen above, the Respondents have sought relief
only in respect of the SBLCs, MWO and/or the WP&Bs. No mention is made of
these or other alleged breaches of the PSAs. Thus, the Tribunal believes that it
need not decide the Respondents’ allegations concerning the alleged breaches
of the PSAs. The Tribunal needs only to decide the counterclaims in respect of
the SBLCs, MWO and the WP&Bs, which it has done above.

. Thus, for the foregoing reasons, all of the Respondents’ counterclaims are
rejected. Thus, the Respondents are not entitled to draw down/should refrain
from drawing down the SBLCs. Neither are the Respondents entitled to
damages for the Claimants’ alleged breaches of the WP&Bs.

Costs

. As mentioned above, on 14 November 2014, the Parties filed their costs
submissions (‘“Claimants’ Costs Submission and “Respondents’ Costs
Submission” respectively), and on 12 December 2014, their replies to each
others costs submissions (“Claimants’ Reply Costs Submission and
“Respondents’ Reply Costs Submission” respectively).

312. On 11 December 2014, the ICC Court fixed the global advance on costs at US$

1,055,000, which the Parties paid equally.

313. On 3 March 2015, the Claimants sent their revised costs submissions

“containing the additional costs incurred in relation to the extension of the
SBLCs and the counterclaims (amount in dispute and separate advances on
costs).”

314. On 14 April 2015, the Tribunal advised the Parties that subject to any views to

the contrary, it would close the proceedings without intending to cover the
matter of costs and the possibility for the Parties to make further cost
statements if necessary.

5. On 4 May 2015, the Tribunal closed the proceedings. The Parties were advised
that they could make no further submissions nor produce evidence unless
requested or authorized by the Tribunal.

6. On (or around) 27 May 2015, the Claimants extended the SBLCs until July
2015. Unlike the earlier extension in March, this extension was not
accompanied by revised costs submissions. Accordingly, the Tribunal has
proceeded on the basis of the Parties’ submissions cited above

N

. In their post-hearing submission, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to:

“(g) order Respondents to pay to Claimants any damages, costs and
expenses (including, but not limited to, legal fees and expenses)
incurred by Claimants in connection with Respondents’ drawing on the
Standby Letters of Credit referred to in paragraph (d) as well as in
connection with Claimants’ extension of the SBLCs;

(h) order Respondents to pay all costs and expenses (including, but
not limited to, costs payable to the ICC, legal fees and expenses, and
fees and expenses of experts, consultants and others) incurred by
Claimants in connection with the preparation for and conduct of this
arbitration”.°"?

8. The Tribunal notes that these two requests somewhat overlap. For instance, in
their Costs Submission, the Claimants sought US$ 5.5 million for “costs and
expenses incurred by Claimants in connection with the preparation for and
conduct of the arbitration” (i.e. request (h) above). The Claimants included in
that amount a sum of US$ 1.5 million for costs incurred due to extension of the
SBLCs, and also a sum of US$ 29,554 for costs for court proceedings in India
(i.e. request (g)). Thus, in the discussion below, the Tribunal considers requests
(g) and (h) together.

In their submission of 3 March 2015, the Claimants detailed their request for

©

costs as under:
“Claimants respectfully request the Tribunal to order Respondents to
pay:

(1) USD 5,957,109.42 (consisting of the already claimed USD
5,546,577.93 plus USD 341,767.44 and USD 68,764.05) for costs
and expenses incurred by Claimants in connection with the
preparation for and conduct of the arbitration;

C-PHB §791.

119

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 123 of 128

(2) in any event, USD 77,627.79 for costs and expenses incurred by
Claimants as a result of Respondents’ two Notes on Quantum and
particularly the subsequently required submission dated 10
November 2014;

(3) in any event, USD 1,941,030.63 as compensation for costs incurred
due to the unnecessary extensions of the SBLCs, which
Respondents demanded even though they agreed that there was
no legal argument requiring such an extension;

(4) if Respondents do not succeed with their additional counterclaims
(in the amount of USD 93,960,000), USD 68,764.05 for costs
incurred by Claimants regarding correspondence with the ICC and
Respondents regarding the amount in dispute and separate
advances on costs.”

o

. In their post-hearing brief, the Respondents sought the following relief:
“223.5.Direct that the Claimants pay the costs of the arbitration and the
Respondents’ costs.”

A “Schedule of Costs” was included with the Respondents’ Costs Submission,
in which the Respondents indicated their costs as under:
“Index and Summary of the Respondents’ Schedule of Costs

. At its session of 24 June 2015, the Court fixed the arbitrators’ fees and the ICC
administrative expenses which, together with the arbitrators’ expenses, amount
to US$ 1,055,000.

322. The Tribunal recalls that Article 37 of the ICC Rules contains the rules

32

32

313

applicable to the Tribunal’s decision on costs:

“1 The costs of the arbitration shall include the fees and expenses of
the arbitrators and the ICC administrative expenses fixed by the Court,
in accordance with the scale in force at the time of the commencement
of the arbitration, as well as the fees and expenses of any experts
appointed by the arbitral tribunal and the reasonable legal and other
costs incurred by the parties for the arbitration.”

L.]

4 The final award shall fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which
of the parties shall bear them or in what proportion they shall be borne
by the parties.

5 In making decisions as to costs, the arbitral tribunal may take into
account such circumstances as it considers relevant, including the
extent to which each party has conducted the arbitration in an
expeditious and cost-effective manner.”

xe

These rules give the Tribunal broad discretion in deciding the costs of the
arbitration. Further, it is generally understood that the Tribunal should give
reasons for the solution it adopts (Article 31(2) of the [CC Rules).

4. A common method of deciding costs is to award costs to the prevailing party or,
where no party clearly prevails, to allocate costs taking into account the relative
success of the claims and defenses ("costs follow the event"). The Parties have
agreed to the application of this method in the case, pointing out that each
others’ conduct in the course of the arbitration should also be taken into
account.5"? On the basis of the Parties’ agreement with which the Tribunal also
agrees, the Tribunal proposes to apply the "costs follow the event" rule in the
present case. Thus, the party that does not prevail is to bear all (or part) of the

Claimants’ submission of 14 November 2014.

121

Case 1:16-cv-01383-EGS Document 1-2 Filed 06/29/16 Page 125 of 128

costs of the proceedings, including those of the other party. As counsel on both
sides conducted this arbitration with high professional standards, the Tribunal
does not see any reason to mitigate the costs of the “winning” Party.

325.

a

Here, the Claimants have succeeded on all their claims, with the exception of
the claim of US$ 4.19 million in respect of the bonuses. The Respondents have
been unsuccessful on all their counterclaims. In the circumstances, and also
because some of the Claimants’ costs are considerably higher than the
Respondents’ (but not unreasonably high),°"* the Tribunal believes that it would
be appropriate for the Respondents to bear 75% of the costs and expenses
incurred by Claimants in connection with the preparation for and conduct of the
arbitration,>" with the exception of the costs and expenses incurred by the
Claimants in extending the SBLCs, which are considered below. Thus, the
Respondents are to pay to the Claimants 75% of US$ 4,016,078.79 (US$
5,957,109.42 (total costs)*'® less US$ 1,941,030.63 (costs for extending the
SBLCs)) which is US$ 3,012,059.09.

326. In respect of the costs and expenses incurred by the Claimants in extending the
SBLCs (US$ 1,941,030.63), the Tribunal notes the Respondents’ submission
that the Claimants are not entitled to claim these costs under Article 37(1) of the
ICC Rules.°"” The Tribunal is unable to agree. After all, the Tribunal ordered the
extension(s) of the SBLCs so as to balance and protect the interests of both
Parties while the arbitration was ongoing. In these circumstances, the Tribunal
believes that the costs expended towards extending the SBLCs were costs
incurred “for the arbitration” under Article 37(1) of the ICC Rules. Consequently,
the Claimants are entitled to recover them in accordance with the principles set
out above. However, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants have claimed
amounts from February 2013, which may not be correct, especially in

314 For instance, the costs and expenses of the Claimants’ experts.

35 The Claimants have sought a total US$ 5,957,109.42 for the following 11 items: (i) White & Case
fees and (ii) Claimants’ (iii) Costs for ion of the SBLCs; (iv) Costs for
court proceedings in India; (v) Yemeni counsel's fees and expenses; (vi) Yemeni legal expert's fees
and expenses; (vii) Security expert’s fees and expenses; (viii) Industry expert's fees and expenses;
(ix) Costs for translators; (x) Advance on ICC costs; (xi) Hearing venue.

"8 The Tribunal understands that item (2) of the Claimants’ request for costs i.e. “[...] USD 77,627.79
for costs and expenses incurred by Claimants as a result of Respondents’ two Notes on Quantum
and particularly the subsequently required submission dated 10 November 2014" is included in the
US$ 5,957,109.42. See Claimants' Costs Submission §14.

circumstances where the PSAs expired at the latest on 17 May 2013. In the

circumstances, keeping this in mind, the Tribunal believes that the Respondents
should pay US$ 776,412.25 (i.e. approximately 40% of US$ 1,941,030.63) to
the Claimants for the costs incurred by the Claimants in extending the SBLCs.
