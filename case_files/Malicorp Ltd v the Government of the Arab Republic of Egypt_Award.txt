shares 0; £/ each», and its object was stated to be to «...carry on business as a
general ‘ommercial company. Its paid-up capital on incorporation was £2. The
changes to its capital, and the confusion between its authorised and paid-up
capital aie a central issue in this case,

§ 9.- The Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority announced the tender for a
new Airort of Ras Sudr, and made available the tender documents in August
1999. ©1 October 1, 1999 the Claimant submitted an offer in response to the

in Cairo or behalf of «Mr. Sayed Hanaft Mahmoud...for the construction of an
International Airport in Ras Sudr», and addressed to the Egyptian General Civil
‘Aviation Authority (dated September 29, 1999; Letter of Guarantee N
32/99/A/114). it is not clear what documentation accompanied the bid, and in
particular whether the Claimant presented an extract from the Companies.
Register in England and Wales in order to confirm its objects and capital,

The Claimant was invited to appear before a committee presided by the President
of the Citil Aviation Sector, Mr. Mamdouh Mohamed Heshmat. The meeting
took place on January 3, 2000 and the letter of invitation set out a list of six
matters vhich the Claimant was expected to clarify. The Claimant was.
represented at this mecting by General Mahmoud Shakir Ibraim (or Ibrahim).
‘The first :juestion related to the details of the Claimant's ‘issued and licensed’
capital, Ti ¢ Minutes of this meeting record the response as follows.

«Upor their question concerning the first point: details of the capital he [i.c.,
Gene al Mahmoud Shakir Ibraim] responded by the following: “The Oris
Com any with which the contracting shall be concluded and which submitted the
offer is the British Company Malicorp Ltd, a company established under the
British law and its residence is in London with its capital of one hundred million
Sterling pounds according to the attached commercial register which was reviewed
hy th: Committee's members»,

‘The Respondents state that the Claimant produced at this meeting an extract from
the register of Companies House, Cardiff, in respect of Malicorp Limited, dated
Septemb«r 15, 1999. The object of Malicorp Limited was stated in this extract to
be «to build, develop and operate the Ras Sudr Airport and to develop associated
sites for industrial and tourist purposes». In respect of capital this extract stated:

«The Company's share capital is £100 miltion divided into one million shares of
£10 each»,

Mr Hestmat confirmed in his oral evidence that he was appointed to head a
committe to review the two bids, and that a meeting was arranged to clarify
certain aspects of Malicorp’s bid. General Shakir Tbraim was the only person
who attended on behalf of Malicorp, and he [i.e., General Ibraim] told the
Commitize that Malicorp’s “paid-up” capital was £100 million, and presented a
commer: ial register issued in the United Kingdom to support this statement
regardin s the paid-up capital. This document was scrutinised by the reviewing
commit :e.

‘The Claimant's evidence, by contrast, was quite explicit that the intention always
was to finance the project from outside sources. For example, Mr, les
Leonides Panayides, the Group Development Director of Group Medi

Holding stated in his oral evidence:

Wheres your lack of seriousness has been established from the signature of the

Based on the above, it has been decided to cancel the agreement ond seize the
letter « guarantee, reserving the right to claim punttive damages for the prejudice
incurr-d by the holding company and the Egyptian Government resulting from the
non-sh rting with the execution of one of the vital and important projects included
in the lanning of the Government for the development of the econonty.»

follows:

end i null and does not concern the Company nor affect it, it is an internal matter
that concerns you solely and does not affect the

contr 2et and law, requesting the Government to deliver the airport site in order to
start with the execution in the interest of the Company and of the Government.»

Vil. Reasons

§3¢.- The Parties have made many arguments in this arbitration. The
Arbitral “‘ribunal for convenience classifies these arguments as
jurisdictional and substantive in nature, and proposes to deal with them in this
‘order, It rscognises that this classification is for convenience only, and many of
the arguments are interrelated or have implications not confined to only one of
procedure, jurisdiction or the merits.

(1) Procedural Issues:
§33.- The Parties itration: The first party to the Concession

The Parties to the Arbitration
Contract is described as «The Arab Republic of Egypt, represented by the
Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority...».

 

The Request for Arbitration (replicating the fonn of the Concession Contract),
named the Arab Republic of Egypt as the Respondent represented by the
Minister of Transportation, the Minister of Civil Aviation, the Egyptian Holding
Company’ for Aviation and the Egyptian Airports Company «all of the above
replacing: the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority». The Request for Arbitration did
not give an address for the Arab Republic of Egypt, but gave a contact address
for each of its four ‘representatives’. Under the heading ‘Contract and Parties’
the Claj nant explained in detail the legal succession to the Ej ian Civil

Aviation Authority

§36.- A contraet (including an arbitration agreement) may be entered into
by an agent and be binding on its principal. However, an arbitration arising from
such contrast is usually commenced against either the principal as the only party
or (if an arsitration agreement can be established with the agent as well as the
principal) «gainst both principal and agent as two separate parties. In the
present cas? the Claimant adopted neither of these possibilities, but rather has
pretended > commence the arbitration against only one party (the Arab Republic
of Egypt) t rough four ‘representatives’.

‘This form was ambiguous as to the legal status of the four representatives in the
arbitration, and in particular whether the Claimant sought to arbitrate a dispute
with the Arab Republic of Egypt, or with the Arab Republic of Egypt and the
four allegid successor entities to the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority. The
ambiguity of the Request for Arbitration was compounded by the Claimant's
insistence that the four ‘representatives’ named in the Request for Arbitration
confirm th? nomination of the arbitrator nominated by the Government of Egypt.

§37.- The legal representation of the Arab Republic of Egypt and
specifically the Ministers of Civil Aviation and the Minister of Transport was
undertaken by the Egyptian State Law Suits Authority, which by virtue of Article
6 of Law N° 75 of 1963 is empowered to «represent all of the public juridical
persons w'th regard to the lawsuits that are filed by or versus the state before the
‘courts...ad before any other entity that is granted jurisdiction by virtue of law...
y. However, the Egyptian Holding Company for Aviation and the Egyptian
Airports Company appointed separate counsel, and developed its own
independent legal position and arguments. Both sets of legal counsel have
participated fully in this arbitration, presenting separate submissions, evidence
‘and witnesses and recciving copies of all submissions or evidence filed by the
other cousel in the arbitration. Both sets of counsel appeared separately at the
hearing, end defended the interests of their respective parties.

‘The Clair rant accepted the separate legal representation of the Arab Republic of
Egypt on the one part, and the Egyptian Holding Company for Aviation and the
Egyptian Airports Company on the other in this manner.

§38.- The Arbitral Tribunal finds that although the Arab Republic of
Egypt wns a party to the arbitration agreement in the Concession Contract and
named a3 Respondent in the Request for Arbitration, the Claimant, the Arab
Republic of Egypt (specifically the Ministers of Transport and Civil Aviation),
the Egyptian Holding Company for Aviation and the Egyptian Airport Company
have ail sy their conduct agreed to participate in this arbitration and accepted the
participa ion of all the others. All have been treated on an equal foosifig, pnd each

have been zecorded an equal and full opportunity to present their cases within the
meaning o! Article 26 of Arbitration Law N° 27 of 1994 and Article 15 of the
CRCICA Rules. Accordingly, the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine
the dispute between the Claimant on the one part, and the Arab Republic of
Egypt (spenifically the Ministers of Transport and Civil Aviation), the Egyptian
Holding Ccmpany for Aviation and the Egyptian Airport Company.

The Arbitial Tribunal emphasizes that his conclusion relates solely to the
jurisdictior of the Arbitral Tribunal over parties that have voluntarily appeared
‘and fully participated in the arbivation. Their implicit consent to arbitrate
involves nus admission of any substantive liability, which was vigorously denied.
‘According y, substantive liability under the Concession Contract must be
separately :xamined, in light of the arguments of all counsel and the applicable
principles of Egyptian law including Article 145 of the Egyptian Civil Code that
confines the effects of a contract «to the parties and to their universal successors
in title, un'ess it follows from the contract from the nature of the transaction or
from a prowision of the law, that the effects of the contract do not pass to the
universal successor in litle of a party».

§39,- The Time Period for the Arbitration: In its Post-Hearing Submission
the Republic of Egypt made a submission based upon Article 45 of Arbitration
Law N° 2} of 1994 which reads as follows:

wArtivle (65)

1. The Arbitral Tribunal shall issue the award finally ending the entire dispute

withir the time frame agreed by the parties, in the absence of such agreement, the
must

2, If the arbitral award is not rendered within the period referred to in the
prece ling paragraph, either of the two parties fo arbitration may request the
ipresi‘ent of the court referred to in Article (9) ofthis law, to tssue an order setting
{a nes dendline or terminating the arbitral proceeding. In such case either party
may raise his claims to the court of original jurisdiction.»

The Arab Republic of Egypt submitted that it bad not agreed to any extension of
time, the award has not been issued within twelve months from the initiation of
the arbital proceedings, and therefore the arbitral proceedings should be
discontinued and terminated as regards the Ministers of Transportation and Civil
Aviation.

§4).- There was an agreement between the Claimant and the Egyptian

The Reput- ic of Egypt had been informed of this mecting but did not attend. The
Ministers uf Transportation and Civil Aviation, on behalf of the Republic of
Egypt, alse received a copy of Procedural Order N° 1 dated December 19, 2004
that included the following paragraphs:

«5, Te Arbltral Tribunal records that the Claimant, The nope Holding

‘The Egyp isn State Law Suits Authority, on behalf of the Republic of Egypt,
duly subniitted its Defence to the Claim in accordance with the timetable
establishe:! in Procedural Order N° 1. The Republic of Egypt did not object to
any part 07 the Procedural Order N° 1 in its Defence to Claim and until its Post-
Hearing submission had never raised any objection to the agreement of the
Parties to extend the time limit in this arbitration and to empower the Arbitral
Tribunal to further extend the time limit at its own discretion. The Arbitral
Tribunal slid in fact exercise this power (also recognised in Article 45(1) of
Asbitration Law N° 27 of 1994) in extending the period for the arbitration by a
further six months until June 19, 2006.

During th: hearing on November 15, 16 and 17, the Arab Republic of Egypt
requested additional time to make Post-Hearing Submissions, to a date beyond
both the criginal twelve month period referred to in Article 45 of Law N° 27 of
1994 and also the initial twelve month hearing agreed at the first procedural
meeting riferred to above, demonstrating again its acceptance of extensions of
the time period of the arbitration. This additional time for Post-Hearing
‘Submissic ns was agreed by all Parties and approved by the Arbitral Tribunal,

§4 .~ It was during the period granted for Post-Hearing Submissions, on

2006». Th’s extension was specifically acknowledged without objection by
counsel fo: the Egyptian Holding Company for Aviation and the Egyptian
Airports Company in its letter of February 11, 2006. The Egyptian State
Lawsuits /.uthority, however, objected to the extension of time in its Post-
Heating Stbmission, although in its Post-Hearing Reply recognised the validity
‘of the proc-edings at least until March 10, 2006 in stating:

«Thersfore the Egyptian State Lawsults Authority on behalf of the Egyptian
Minist,r of Civil Aviation and the Egyptian Minister of Transportation hereby
noufle: the Arbitral Tribunal and the Parties that it will regrettably resort to tha
compe.¢nt domestic court in accordance to Articte 45 of the applicable Egyptian
‘arbitration Law No. 27 of 1994 and its amendments, wnless the Arbitral Tribunal
appli, the aforementioned article and takes note of discontinuance and
termin ution of the present arbitral proceedings for the First and Second
Respo: dents on or before March 10, 2006,»

In these circumstances, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the Republic of Egypt, by
its conducl, has accepted the agreement of the other parties recorded in paragraph
5 of Proc :dural Order N° 1, and therefore the award is issued «within the
timeframe agreed by the parties» in accordance with Article 45(1). Alternatively,
the Repub ic of Egypt has failed to raise its objection to the alleged breach of
Article 45 within a reasonable time, and therefore has waived its right to object in
accordanci: with Article $ of Law N° 27 of 1994, which reads as follows:

§42.- Therefore the Arbitral Tribunal does not accept the submission of
the Reput lic of Egypt that the time period in accordance with Article 45(1) or
Law N° 2” of 1994 has expired,

§4:.- Claimant's Legal Representation in Egypt: The Egyptian Holding
Company for Aviation and the Egyptian Airports Company submitted that the
Request {>r Arbitration and all subsequent proceedings in this arbitration were
null and yoid for breach of the Egyptian Advocacy Law N° 17 of 1983 in that the
Claimant's counsel, a Lebanese lawyer, did not satisfy the mandatory
requirements regarding legal representation in Egypt. Asticle 3 of Advocacy Law
N° 17 states that no one except a lawyer as defined in this Law is entitled to
practice law in Egypt, with practice of law including «presence on behalf of
competen* parties before courts and arbitral wribunals...and the practice of
pleadings and relevant judicial proceedings.» A lawyer is a person name

is register: in the list of lawyers, and apparently Mr. Daouk, the Claimant’s
representalive, is not so regis!

It is furthe” submitted that the provisions of the Egyptian Advocacy Law N° 17 of
1983 relate to Egyptian public order «because it relates to the operation of the
Judiciary ond justice which ts a primary duty of the State, and the law profession
is @ free rofession which contributes with the judicial power to administer
Justice, as: ert the rule of law and the right to defend the rights and freedoms of
citizens, and the legislator has decided a criminal punishment for breach of the
provisions of this law» (Egyptian Holding Company for Aviation and the
Egyptian / irports Company, Post-Hearing Submission, paragraph 219).

§44.- The Claimant states that Advocacy Law N° 17 of 1983 does not
apply to this intervational arbitration and states that the capacity of counsel in
this arbitr:tion does not raise any question of Egyptian public order. It refers to
Article 4 cf the CRCICA Rules which states that «the parties may be represented
or assistes by persons of its choice», and state that if necessary Mr, Daouk can be
simply cor sidered as a representative of the Claimant and not as its lawyer.

§45.- The Arbitral Tribunal does not accept that the representation of a
foreign investor by a lawyer not registered for practice in Egypt in an Egyptian
arbitration raises any question of Egyptian public order. It is no doubt correct that
one purpo.i¢ of Advocacy Law N° 17 of 1983 is to ensure the rights and freedoms
of patties .1re properly defended and to facilitate the administration of justice, but
there is ro reason to consider that a foreign Claimant in an international
arbitration cannot be adequately represented by a foreign lawyer.

The Clairsant's legal representative does not require detailed knowledge of
Egyptian judicial practice and procedure in order to properly represent the
Claimant’. interests in an international arbitration. If for any reason judicial
proceedin;;s were commenced in Egypt relating to this arbitration then of course
Egyptian-egistered counsel would be required for those proceedings. Further,
the Claimant might engage an Egyptian lawyer for assistance with Egyptian
substantiv law, as the Claimant in fact did in this case, but still prefer the case to
be led by its international counsel.

It is com. on practice in international commercial arbitration for the parties to be
represented by counsel of their choice. This freedom of representation is derived
from the >rinciple of party autonomy, upon which international arbitration is
founded, ind is so widcly recognised that it could be said to form part of
transnatio.1al public policy in international commercial arbitration. itral
Tribunal s not convinced that in Egypt, a jurisdiction where j ional,

 
    

aus

7/03 °06 14:14 TEL 34 91 570 97 94 B. CREMADES & ASOCTADOS Bosz

arbitration is well-established, public policy is any way inconsistent with
intematior al standards in this regard.

Further, the public policy interest of any state of the proper representation of
parties anc. administration of justice in legal proceedings held witbin its borders
in fact fivours the participation of international counsel in international
arbitration Such participation enables a foreign party to be represented by
counsel o}' confidence, of past association, of knowledge of their business, of
experience in international arbitration law and practice, and with the necessary
linguisitic skills for the proceedings. The narrow interpretation of the public
policy of Advocacy Law N° 17 of 1983 proposed by the Egyptian Holding
Company for Aviation and the Egyptian Airports Company would lead to the
result, abs ard from the public policy perspective of the administration of justice,
of declaring these arbitral proceedings void and denying the Claimant all the
work of it: legal representative since April 2004.

§4€.- Accordingly, the submission to declare the proceedings null and
void beca ise the Claimant has not been represented by a lawyer registered in
Egypt is nijected. Whether there has or has not been a breach of Article 3 or the
other provisions of Advocacy Law N° 17 of 1983 is purely a matter for the
Egyptian courts. The Arbitral Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant's
representa ion raises no question of Egyptian public policy, and that Mr. Daouk’s
actions ar valid and effective as the representative of the Claimant in this
arbitration.

§47.-_Failure to_have Prior Recourse to Alternative Means of Dispate
Resolutio: : Counsel for the Egyptian Holding Company for Aviation and the
Egyptian Airports Company submitted in its Post-Hearing Submission that the
Concessio Contract contained a mandatory pre-condition to submit a dispute to
an Experi appointed pursuant to Article 6 before submission to arbitration.
Accordingly, the submission to arbitration was premature, and the Arbitral
Tribunal c oes not have jurisdiction.

The Arbiiral Tribunal cannot accept this argument on a number of grounds.

Firstly, Atticle 6.1 mandates the appointment of an Expert when «any decision is
required :2 be made in terms of this Concession Contract», and the making of
such a ‘dzcision’ is quite a distinct function from the resolution of disputes.
Further, -\rticle 21.3.1 clearly contemplates the submission of disputes to
arbitratior that have not previously been subject to an expert determination («/fa
dispute...including, but not limited to, any dispute as to any opinion, instruction,
determinction, certification or valuation of the Expert...», emphasis ad

  

3Us3

07/03 (06 14:14 TEL 34 01 576 07 v4 B, CREMADES & ASOCrADOS Boas

The Arbit-al Tribunal is satisfied that the nature of the dispute in this case,
involving the termination of the Concession Contract, was not of a kind that
required s ibmission to an Expert. Further, the Arbitral Tribunal is Satisfied that
the Claimant made genuine efforts to reach an amicable settlement prior to
commenci 1g arbitration. Finally, in the present circumstances any requirement of
Prior recourse to alternative methods of dispute resolution should not be applied
formalisti: ally to frustrate the resolution of the dispute. The dispute in this case is
of a very serious nature (including cancellation of the Concession Contract,
allegation: of fraud) and all Parties have fully participated in the arbitration, and
so the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal cannot be called into question on this
basis.

(2) Jurisd ction/Consent to Arbitrate:

§48.- The Respondents challenge the jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal
‘on the basis of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Arbitration Law N° 27 of
1994, Th:s paragraph requires an arbitration agreement in an administrative
contract tc whave the approval of the concerned minister or the official assuming
his power. with respect to public juridical persons», This submission requires
the Arbitril Tribunal to consider first whether the Concession Contract is an
administrative contract in Egyptian law and, if so, to examine whether the
arbitration agreement had the appropriate approval required by Article 1 of
Arbitratioi; Law N° 27 of 1994,

§49.- fat Concessi Tn Egypt there is a
fundamenial division between private law and administrative law. According to
Article 172 of the Egyptian Constitution the Council of State is an independent
judicial or zanisation competent in administrative disputes. The Council of State
has built u2 a theory of administrative contracts distinct from civil contracts.

§50.- The nature of administrative contracts was considered (in the context
of arbitration) by a General Meeting of the Council of State. The General
Mecting’s legal opinion presented three differences between administrative
contracts ind civil contracts (see Dr. Mohie Eldin I. Alam Eldin ‘Arbitral
Awards o! the Cairo Regional Centre for International Commercial Arbitration,
Case N° 2 (Commentary):

(1) Administrative contracts always Include a party who represents public
evuthorities:

(2) Sach contracts are not related to ordinary transactions such as sale or le
‘omong private law persons, but they deal with the creation, develo
» eintenance of public utilisies; and

07/03 ‘06 14:15 TEL 34 91 576 97 94 B. CREMADES & ASOCIADOS Boas

(3) Such contracts contain exceptional clauses not found in ctvil contracts.»

§51.- The Parties substantially agree that the Concession Contract is an
administra:ive contract, but disagree on its particular characteristics as an
administra ive contract and their legal consequences, The Respondents submit
that the Concession Contract is a typical administrative contract. The Claimant
submits that «Zhe Egyptian doctrine and case law consider the B.O.T. contracts
as intern: tlonal administrative contracts and the international arbitration
doctrine considers it as @ contract of particular nature and therefore the
regulation: of an ordinary administrative contract do not apply» (Claimant's
Rejoinder on Claim, paragraph 167 (emphasis original)).

The deterr ination of the juridical nature of the Concession Contract must begin
by considering the terms and conditions of the Concession Contract itself.

§52 - The Preamble of the Concession Contract states that the Concession
Contract is «based on the investment laws N° 3 and 8 both of the year 1997». The
Preamble «f the Heads of Agreement also refers to Laws N° 3 and N° 8 of 1997,
Law N° 3 > 1997 is entitled ‘On granting the concession of a Public utility for
constructirg, managing, and exploiting airports and landing lands’ and contains
specific pr visions relating to the airport concessions «without restriction by the

isions of law N° 139 for 1947 for the concessions of the public utilities and
law N° 61 ‘or 1958 concerning granting concessions related to the investment of
natural resources and the public utilities...». Law N° 8 for 1997 relates to
investment! guarantees and incentives and their executive regulations, and
includes, iver alia, detailed regulations relating to the incorporation and capital
of investm :nt companies, which are considered in further detail below. Both the
Preamble 1> the Concession Contract and the Preface to the Heads of Agreement
relate the : onstruction of Ras Sudr airport to a plan at a national level to build
new airports to take advantage of the development opportunities offered by air
transportat on. It was also conceived as part of a larger project potentially
including «hotels, tourism, shopping centers, industrial agriculture etc in order
to achieve the necessary demand for passengers needed by the airport for
economic »iabilityy,

The Concession Contract is for a period of forty-one years. Article 24 of the
Concessior, Contract provided that «Both parties shall abide by the revision of
the Counci! of State of this contract», This requirement accords with Article 5 of
Law N° 3 of 1997 that provides that «A decree of the Council of Ministers shall
be issued t.von the proposal of the competent Minister, awarding the concession,

as well as sletermining or amending its conditions or provisions,...». Atticle 21.1

Of the Rep iblic of Egypt». Turning to the Egyptian Civil Code 1948, Article 668

provides:

Art. 68.~ A concession of @ public utility service is a contract whose object is the
‘mana; ement of a public utility service of an economic nature. Such a is
conch ded berween the administrative authority in charge of the organisation of
such « service and a private person or company to whom the exploitation of the
servic. is entrusted for a fixed period,»

§53- The proper description of the contract is a legal question (and
therefore not within the exclusive power of the parties to designate, so that
Article 21 1 of the Concession Contract cannot be considered determinative of
the nature of the Concession Contract). Accordingly, the Arbitral Tribunal
concludes that the Concession Contract is a public concession within the
meaning of Article 668 of the Civil Code, and also an administrative contract in
Egyptian lw, The factors demonstrating its administrative nature include (i) One
party is tie Egyptian state, represented by a public authority (namely the
Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority which is described as a public authority in
Presidentic1 decree N° 2931 of 1971; (ii) The contract is a concession contract
relating tc a public utility (namely airports and landing grounds which are
described :s a public utility concession, for example, in Law N° 3 of 1997); (iii)
The Concession Contract raises issues of state sovereignty and national policy in
respect of air traffic, safety, tourism and infrastructure development; (iv) The
Concession Contract is subject to a specific regulatory framework (Law N° 3 of
1997); (v) The Concession Contract contains exceptional clauses not found in
civil contricts (most importantly the requirement of approval by the Council of
State and tae granting in Article 2.6.5 of wall rights, privileges and warranties as
stated in Liw 8 of the year 1997»).

ational of the 5

Claimant las submitted that the Concession Contract should be described as an
internatio.ral administrative contract. The Claimant has not identified any
particular ules or exemptions applicable to the Concession Contract as a matter
of domestic Egyptian administrative law by reason of its international nature.
Counsel for the Egyptian Holding Company for Aviation and the Egyptian
Airports Company submitted that the international element in an administrative
contract is irrelevant where there is an explicit choice of law, as there is of
Egyptian lw in this case,

This Concission Contract is properly described as an international contract. The
Claimant i: an English company (specifically recognised in Article 23.1.1), the
Contract rc lates to an international airport (expressly recognised, for,
Article 115.5), and the Claimant must ensure the Airport compfi

   

17/03 “06 14:18 TEL 34 91 576 97 94 B. CREMADES & ASOCTADOS Dore

internatios al obligations imposed by the Warsaw Convention (Article 22.12.3).
Further, th: arbitration agreement within the Concession Contract is international
within the meaning of Article 3 of Arbitration Law N° 27 of 1994,

The impcriance of the characterisation of the Concession Contract as
intematioral does not lie within the domestic Egyptian legal order. Its
internatior al nature means that some aspects of the Contract —most significantly
the arbitr:tion agreement-are also part of international legal relations and
therefore may be subject to rules outside the domestic Egyptian legal order. In
the presert case, the international nature of the Concession Contract and
arbitration agreement has consequences for the rules applicable to certain issues
raised in tt is arbitration.

§55 Jurisdiction: Article 1 of the Arbitration Law N° 27 of 1994; The
Responder ts challenge the jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal on the basis that,
being an idministrative contract, the arbitration agreement did not «have the
approval vf the concerned minister or the official assuming his powers with
respect to public juridical persons» as required by the second paragraph of
Article 1 o* Arbitration Law N° 27 of 1994.

§56- The Claimant submits that the arbitration agreement in the
Concession Contract complies with the second paragraph of Article 1 of
Asbitratior Law N* 27 of 1994. The Claimant states that pursuant to Presidential
Decree N° 2931 of 1971 the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority was a public
Juridical px rson, with its own juridical personality and patrimony and represented
by its Chairman. Further, the Chairman of the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority
was the of icial who in fact signed the Concession Contract, The Claimant also
‘States that the Minister of Transportation clearly approved the Concession
Contract, even if he did not sign it.

Egypt docs not dispute that the Minister of Transportation approved the
Concessio:. Contract, but states that Article 1, second paragraph, requires the
approval cf the arbitration agreement, which as a matter of Egyptian law is
separate fiom the Concession Contract, and the arbitration agreement has not
been approved by the Minister.

§57.- Presidential decree N° 2931 of 1971 created the Egyptian Civil
Aviation Authority. Article 7 states that the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority is
managed by its Chairman in accordance with «the terms of this decree and under
the supervision of the State Minister for Civil Aviation matters», Article 7 goes
on to state that «The Chairman represents the Authority in its yélaijons with

e 36083

| 97703 *08 14:16 TEL 34 91 576 97 94 B. CREMADES & ASOCIADOS oar

other Aut) orities, third parties and the Judiciary», The Chairman has in fact
signed the Concession Contract, and every page of the Concession Contract is
initialed oy its signatories, including the page containing the arbitration
agreement

The Arbit al Tribunal also note that Dr. Suleman Mohamed El Tamaoui in
Administrs tive Law: A Comparative Study (ed. Dar El Fikt El Araby) at page
335-336 iicludes the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority in the category of
Egyptian rublic authorities.

According y, the Arbitral Tribunal is satisfied that the Chairman of the Egyptian
Civil Avia ion Authority was an official empowered under Egyptian law to enter
into an aibitration agreement with respect to an administrative contract. It
follows thit the arbitration agreement is binding and effective and the Arbitral
Tribunal h ts jurisdiction over this dispute. The Arbitral Tribunal is also satisfied
that the Minister of Transportation knew and approved of this arbitration
agreement, for the reasons set out in §66 below.

§58 - As a final point, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that while Article 1,
second paiagraph is clearly part of Egyptian domestic law and arbitration, its
status in a1 international commercial arbitration with a foreign investor is less
certain, There is ample indication in this case that the Arab Republic of Egypt
has sought to establish a secure regime for the protection of foreign investment
in Egypt (tor example, the protections in Laws N° 3 and 8 of 1997 and the UK-
Egypt BIT and Arbitration Law N° 27 of 1994), so that in normal circumstances
this right t» arbitrate should not be lost on the basis that a senior official lacked
the appropiate authority. Such a result would be contrary to good faith (pacta
sund servanda). Indeed the Cairo Court of Appeal in its judgment of March 3,
1997 has r: cognised the importance of good faith in this context,

The Arbitial Tribunal also refers to the well-recognised principle in public
intemation il law that a State is bound by the acts of an official vested with

authority when that person acts in his official capacity, even if he
exceeds hi: authority or contravenes instructions (see for example, article 7 of
the Interna ional Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility) and to the
principle o * transnational public policy that a State party or public entity should

incapacity.

 

§59.-~ Jurisdiction: inistrative ici ion: The
Administrutive Judiciary Court Decision found that under Egyptian law this
Court shar‘ d jurisdiction with an arbitration tribunal to rule on a nge to the
validity of an arbitration agreement («While [Article 22 of Arbj ‘Law 27 of

1994] conferred upon the arbitral mtbunal the authority to rule on these
challenge: and pleas, it does not and should not deprive the judge of the
authority 10 rile on such challenges and pleas should they be raised before
him... If tre Legislator wanted to limit the competence to the arbitral panels, it
would hae been easy for it to add the expression ‘exclusively’»). It went on to
find that there was no Ministerial approval of the arbitration agreement in this
case, as required by Article 1, second paragraph, of Arbitration Law N° 27 of
1994, and therefore the arbitration agreement was null and void.

Article 22:1) of Arbitration Law N° 27 of 1994 reads as follows:

«d- Tie arbitral tribunal is empowered to rule on motions related to its non-
competence, including motions based on the absence of an arbitral clause. its
‘expiry or nullity, or it's failure to include the subject or the dispute.»

Article 22(1) reflects the internationally recognised principle of komperenz/
kompetenz in arbitration. In accordance with Article 22(1) and this principle this
Arbitral Tribunal, for the reasons set out above, finds the arbitration agreement in
this Concession Contract binding and effective on the Arab Republic of Egypt.
This Tribcnal also considers that it has the sole and exclusive jurisdiction to
make this :Jecision.

The effect of the Administrative Judiciary Court Decision is that one state organ
(the Administrative Judiciary Court) is seeking to release the State from an
international obligation entered into by another State organ (the Chairman of the
Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority) on the basis of a failure to comply with the
State’s ow 1 administrative law. Domestic legal obligations might be dealt with
in this mar ner, but where senior officials of the State enter into obligations with
the citizen: of another State (in this case, an arbitration agreement with a British
company) thea the resulting responsibility of the State is to be determined
according ‘o intemational rules and principles, and not domestic law.

§60 - Jurisdiction: Article $8 of Council of State Law N° 47 of 1972: The
Egyptian Holding Company for Aviation and the Egyptian Airports Company
submitted hat Article $8 of Council of State Law N° 47 of 1972 required the
Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority to submit the Concession Contract and the
arbitration agreement for approval by the Council of State, and as this was not
done the C mncession Contract is a nullity,

Article 24 of the Concession Contract specifically provided for the agreement

agreemen itself, refers to principle of transnational public policy already
mentionec. by which in respect of an intemational contract a State party cannot
invoke its domestic law to escape the effects of an arbitration agreement entered
into by its officials,

(3) Jurisdiction/the Significance of the UK-Egypt BIT:

§61.- The Arbitral Tribunal in Procedural Order N° 2 specifically asked
the partie; to clarify at the hearing the «significance (if any) of the United
Kingdom. Sgypt Bilateral Investment Treaty to the matters at issue in this
arbitratiov», The Claimant in its Post-Hearing Submissions stated that the
Respondeuts have not only abusively cancelled the Concession Contract, but
have also »eached their obligations under the Egypt-UK BIT, and referred to the
‘wide reac ing’ of ‘umbrella clauses’ in investment treaties. «However, Claimant
has reque.:ted from the present arbitral tribunal compensation for this abusive
cancellati»n as a contractual breach and has reserved its right to further
recourse to ICSID if necessary.» (Claimant's Post-Heating Submission,
paragraph 424). Egypt in its Post-Hearing Submission (paragraph 30, emphasis
added) stated that «the Concession Contract includes a forum selection clause
which govzrn all the claims of the parties under the contract, and not under the
Treaty Thus all the treaty based claims fall outside the scope of the Iribunal’s
Jjurisdictio 1.»

§62 - The Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of
Great Britzin and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Arab Republic of
Egypt for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (WUK-Egypt BIT»)
entered ino force on February 24, 1976, The UK-Egypt BIT establishes the
investor protections customary in such treaties such as national and most-
favoured-r ation treatment (Article 3), the right to compensation in the event of
expropriat on (Article 5) and repatriation of investment (Article 6). Article 8
addresses fisputes between a State Party and an investor, which establishes a
right to conciliation or arbitration pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement
of Investirent Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States
(Washingtn, 1965), after attempts to resolve the dispute by other means during
4 period of at least three months,

The significance of the UK-Egypt BIT to the present dispute arises from the final
sentence 0 "Article 2(2), Article 2(2) reads as follows (emphasis added):

«Promotion and protection of investment
OD) we

2) In, estments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shajlet all
times \¢ accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full pro and

Y 39183

07/03 ‘pO 14:18 TEL 34 91 S76 97 94 B. CREMADES & ASOCIADOS oso

secur'ty in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party
shall ensure that the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of
invessments in its territory of nationals or companies of the other Contracting
Pary is not in any way impaired by unreasonable or discriminatory measures.
Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into
with ‘egard to investments of nationats or companies of the other Contracting
Party.»

The final saragraph of Article 2(2) is a pacta sund servanda clause (sometimes
called an ‘umbrella’ clause) that purports to bring within the Treaty the breach of
obligations not specifically created or enumerated in the treaty. In this case ‘any
Obligation’ in Article 2(2) refers principally to contractual obligations as it is
followed by the expression ‘may have entered into ‘, which suggests an
agreemen| or at least a formal undertaking.

§62.- The Claimant has not submitted any request to arbitration under the
UK-Egyp! BIT, and so at present there is not parallel arbitral proceedings
considering issues arising between the same partics or relating to the same
dispute.

Article 21 3.1 of the Concession Contract confers jurisdiction over this Arbitral
Tribunal n respect of «a dispute of any kind whatsoever...between the
Concessoi ...and the Concessionaire...in connection with or arising out of the
Concession Contract» (emphasis added). The jurisdiction of this Arbitrat
Tribunal i: very wide and it certainly has jurisdiction over ‘any obligation’ that
‘may have been entered into’ by the Arab Republic of Egypt in connection with
or arising -vut of the Concession Contract.

By virtue of Clause 21.3 of the Concession Contract the Parties have submitted
to this Arijtral Tribunal the dispute arising from the Concession Contract. The
fact that Article 2(2) of the UK-Egypt BIT on its face might allow the Claimant
to submit the present dispute (or some parts of the present dispute) to another
forum doe; not affect or in any way limit the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal,
The Clair ant has elected to submit these disputes (arising out of or connection
with the Concession Contract) to the jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal, and
these sami: disputes have not already been submitted to or determined by any
ICSID trisunal established pursuant to the UK-Egypt BIT. Therefore this
Tribunal coes not need to consider and is not in any manner constrained by
issues of lis pendens or res judicata.

 

§64- Accordingly, the Arbitral Tribunal accepts the Position of the
Republic ¢f Egypt, and finds that it has jurisdiction over all claims arising from
the Conce: sion Contract, and does not have any jurisdiction oveyTr ity claims

  

17/03 ‘06 14:18 TEL 34 91 576 97 94 B. CREMADES & ASOCTADOS ost

under the Egypt-UK BIT. It also notes that the Claimant has only requested
compensation for breaches of the Concession Contract.

(4) Breac 1 / Annulment of the Concession Contract:

§6:.- The first substantive issue relates to the Parties to the Concession
Contract, Article 145 of the Egyptian Civil Code confines the effect of a contract
«to the parties and to their universal successors tn title, unless it follows from the
contract J-om the nature of the transaction or from a provision of the law, that
the effect: of the contract do not pass to the universal successor in title ofa
party».

The Repiblic of Egypt submits that it is not a party to this “municipal"
Concessioa Contract, It states that the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority was a
separate 1: gal entity, and had no authority to conclude a contract on behalf of the
Minister cf Transport or the Minister of Civil Aviation, and therefore could not
bind the Republic of Egypt. Counsel for the Egyptian Holding Company for
Aviation ind the Egyptian Airports Company submit that the Egyptian Civil
Aviation Authority was representing the Ministry of Transport by virtue of
Presidenti.) Decree N° 360 of 1999 and so Egypt, and not the successor entities
to the Egy stian Civil Aviation Authority, is a party to the Concession Contract.

§66.- The Arbitral Tribunal finds that the Concession Contract binds the
Republic « f Egypt, within the framework of restrictions imposed both by its own
terms and by applicable Egyptian administrative law. The evidence clearly
establishe: that the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority was acting with the
knowledg: and under the control of the Minister of Transport, and that this
situation persisted for eighteen months between the signature of the Heads of
Agreemen: and the termination (by the Minister of Transport) of the Concession
Contract. For example, the Minister of Transportation expressly invited the
Norwegiar. ambassador to the signing ceremony and appeared at the ceremony
(Exhibits 520 and C22 respectively). The Minister of Transport chaired the
Special Commission that on July 21, 2001 made the decision to cancel the
Concessio:: Contract. The Minister of Transport confirmed the cancellation of the
Concessio.1 Contract by letter dated September 28, 2001. Finally, the Letters of
Guarantee were called by the Head of the Financial and Administrative
Departmer t of the Ministry of Transportation (Exhibit C106).

§67 - The Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority has an express role in the
Concession Contract as the representative of the Arab Republic of, t, and its
signature cn the Concession Contract is a clear representation to she Claimant of

YL

ans

27/03 “06 14:19 TEL 34 91 570 ST 94 B. CREMADES & ASOCTADOS Bose

its power and suthority to enter into the Concession Contract on behalf of the
Arab Rep iblic of Egypt. It also has express rights under the Concession Contract
(such as “he right of access to Air Traffic Navigation Facilities under Article
7.2.1.3), “he evidence establishes that the successors in title to the Egyptian
Civil Aviation Authority, particularly pursuant to Presidential Decree No.
72/2001, nchade the Egyptian Holding Company for Aviation and the Egyptian
Airports Company. As the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority was at all times
acting as an agent and was not a party to the Concession Contract, the claims
against th: Egyptian Holding Company for Aviation and the Egyptian Airports
Company are accordingly dismissed.

$6t .- The Concession Contract was expressly subject to ‘revision’ by the
Council cf State (Article 24). The introduction (page 9, ‘General’) of the
Concessioa Contract recognised that it was subject to a feasibility study and
«may be cancelled if the relevant Feasibility Study shows the Airport Project and
Annexed !'rojects cannot be carried out in a sound economic manner». Further,
the Concession Contract was expressly subject to the Laws N° 3 and N° 8 of
1997, and Article 5 of Law N° 3 of 1997 requires a decree from the Council of
Ministers «upon a proposition by the competent minister concerning granting the
concessio:. defining its terms and provisions, or amending them...» The
Claimant 1as not demonstrated that any such decree was ever promulgated in
respect 0;° the Concession Contract. Accordingly, the Arbitral Tribunal is
satisfied taat the Concession Contract, although binding on Egypt, was not
unconditic nally effective, and Egypt retained the power to cancel the Concession
Contract.

§69.~ The evidence satisfies the Arbitral Tribunal that the Concession
Contract was in fact cancelled by Egypt for a combination of reasons, including:
(i) conceras regarding the delay in incorporating the mandatory Egyptian
subsidiary and doubts regarding the accuracy or authenticity of information
provided f yr this purpose; (ii) concerns regarding the identity of the shareholders
and assoc ates of the Claimant and its proposed Egyptian subsidiary; (iii) a
perceived ack of professionalism (‘seriousness’) and suitability of the Claimant
for a proje:t of this nature arising from delays and the problems in the provision
of informe tion; (iv) that the Claimant had failed to comply with its obligations
under the Concession Contract.

§70 - The Republic of Egypt also submitted that the Concession Contract
could be cancelled because of the breaches of contract of the Claimant (exeptio
non adimp'eti contractus) and for breach of good faith. The Art ibunal is

   

42/53

17/03 ‘06 14:19 TEL 34 91 576 97 94 B. CREMADES & ASOCIADOS oss

Aot requird to enter into these arguments in detail in light of its other decisions
in this awd, particularly regarding mistake,

§71.- The Respondents submit that the Concession Contract is void for the
«graudulevt artifices which led to the conelusion of a contract, and [which] were
of such gravity that, but for them, the contracting party would not have
concluded the contract» (Post-Hearing Submission of the Egyptian Holding
Company for Aviation and the Egyptian Airports Company, paragraph 230). The
allegation: of fraud relate to the capital of the Claimant, and include a serious
allegation that a forged ‘commercial register’ of the Claimant company,
fraudulant y misrepresenting its capital, was used to obtain the Concession
Contract. The Arbitral Tribunal has reviewed exhaustive submissions of the
Parties on this question. It notes that these allegations of fraud in relation to this
contract v,ere not relied upon at the time of the termination of the Concession
Contract aid were not raised until after this arbitration was commenced.

§72.- The importance of the capital of the Claimant, the incorporation of
the Egypti in subsidiary and the approval of the Investment Authority arises from
certain provisions of Law N° 8 for 1997, Article 4 of the Law provides as
follows:

«Article (4)

The c: mpetent administrative department shall undertake revising the contract of
the co.npanies articles and memoranda of assoctation. It should be indicated in the
contrat of establishment and by-laws the names of the contracting parties, the
legal ,orm of the company, tts name, the subject of ite activity, its duration, itt
eapita , the share of contribution of the Eeyptian and non Egyptian parties, the
meant of subscription therein and the partners rights and obligations must be
stated ‘n the articles and memoranda of association. And the preliminary contracts
and the articles of association of the joint stock companies and the limited
partne ships shall be prepared according to the forms of which a decree from the
counei! of ministers shall be promulgated.

The sivmatures on the companies contract must be authenticated, whatever be their
legal j wm in return of an authentication fee...

And the license for the association of companies shall be issued from the competent
admin strative department, according to the provisions of this law and shall have
the rig'st in its benefits. And these companies shall have the legal person from the
date a, their entry in the commercial register. And the articles of association of the
compary and its memorandum of essociation shall be published according to the
rrules and procedures which the executive statutes of this law shall define.

And te above provisions shall apply to cack amendment of the
systen:»

  

07/03 ‘96 14:20 TEL 34 91 376 97 94 B, CREMADES & ASocrApos Boss

Article 4 has strict and detailed requirements relating to the revision of the
articles ard memorandum of the articles and memorandum of association, the
Corporate activities, its capital, the share and contribution of Egyptian and non-
Egyptian parties, the means of subscription, and the authentication of signatures,
However, by contrast, Law N° 3 of 1997, the law most directly connected with
the construction and management of airports, does not contain any explicit
requiremets relating to the capital of an investor. In fact, Article 1 of Law N° 3
of 1997, ly providing that airport concessions may be granted to Egyptian or
foreign investors ‘whether natural or juridical persons’ suggests there is no
mandator, capital requirements,

§72.- The issue here was the method of financing of the project. The
Claimant considered that the capital requirements were satisfied, at least
provisiouslly, by increasing the authorised capital to £100 million. Whether this
capital wes subscribed and issued, or finance was arranged from alternative
sources, was an issue that might be addressed during the performance of the
Concessio1 Contract. By contrast, the Egyptian officials considered this to be an
important iubstantive requirement at the outset.

The differ «nt perceptions of this issue led to confusion. The Claimant was casual
in the preszntation of its documentation and in response to questions, and did not
distinguist. between authorised (and not paid) and issued (paid-up) capital. The
Egyptian «fficials for their part, in an issue of this importance, could have made
further independent inquiries. The different importance referred to above given to
the capita requirements of investors in Laws N° 3 and 8 of 1997 may have
contribute | to these distinct perceptions.

‘The Arbitial Tribunal is satisfied that the Arab Republic of Egypt committed an
essential mistake in entering into the Concession Contract in that it believed that
the registe ‘ed and paid-up capital of the Claimant was £100 million. Further, it is
Satisfied that the Claimant could have, and should have, detected this mistake,
and that the mistake is of such gravity that had it not been committed the Arab
Republic « f Egypt would not have entered into the Concession Contract.

Article 120 and 121 of the Civil Code provide for essential mistake. These
Articles read as follows:

«Art, °20.- A party to a contract may demand the avoidance of the contract if he
comm.tted an essential mistake, if the other Party committed the same mistake or

had kr owledge thereof. or could have easily detected the mistake.
Att. 1td.- A mistake is an essential misiake when its gravity i of such a
that, ("it had not been committed. the party who was mistaken, would

conch ded the contract,

44is3

| 97/03 "96 14:20 TEL 34 91 576 97 94 B. CREMADES & ASOCTADOS Boss

The m stake is deemed to be essential more particularly:

(a) hen it has a bearing on the quality of the thing, which the parties have
consicered essential or which must be deemed essential, taking into consideration
the ch cumstances surrounding the contract and the good faith that should prevatt
‘in bus ness relationships.

(0) wien it has @ bearing on the identity or on one of the qualities of the person
with ~hom the contract is entered into, if this identity or this quality was the
princi al factor in the conclusion of the contract,»

The resposibility for this mistake rests primarily with the Claimant for the
ambiguou: information it provided in circumstances when it should have
tealised the importance of the issue of paid up capital to the Egyptian officials.
However, here is also some responsibility of the Egyptian officials in failing to
clarify the importance of this issue or to make independent inquiries. The
Arbitral T ibunal assesses the respective responsibility of the Parties as ninety
percent wi h the Claimant and ten percent with the Respondent.

 

$74 - The Arbitral Tribunal therefore declares the Concession Contract is
void for riistake. The consequences are described in Articles 138-144 to the
Egyptian Civil Code and particularly Article 142 which reads as follows:

«An, 42. When @ contract is void or annulled, the parties are reinstated in their
positicn prior to the contract. If such reinstatement is impossible, danages
equivalent to the loss may be awarded.»

  

The Arbit-al Tribunal notes that the Concession Contract contains express
provisions for compensation in the event of cancellation of the Contract by the
Republic «f Egypt (see Article 19.1.3). However, as the Arbitral Tribunal bas
found thai the Concession Contract is void for mistake it considers that the
damages s r0uld be calculated in accordance with Article 142 of the Civil Code
‘on the basis of damages in lieu of reinstatement.

§75- Article 46 Arbitration Law N° _27/Suspension for Criminal
Proceedin; s: The Respondents have submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal must
suspend these arbitration proceedings pursuant to Article 46 of Arbitration Law
N° 27 of 1'194 until a final judgment is issued in the criminal proceedings relating
to the Concession Contract. This request was made during the proceedings and
was the su sect of a majority ruling of the Arbitral Tribunal dated September 19,
2005. The Egyptian Holding Company for Aviation and the Egyptian Airports
Company n its Post-Hearing Submission renewed this request for icle 46
suspension, submitting that as a matter of Egyptian public iminal
proceedings must take precedence,

In consid:ring the relationship between criminal Proceedings and arbitral

Proceedini;s the Arbitral Tribunal notes that the principle of “le penal tient le

civil en ett” docs not apply in any absolute way in Egyptian law, The Claimant

referred tle Arbitral Tribunal to the decision of the High Constitutional Court

(Cassation N° 8 of the Judicial Year 22; hearing of August 4, 2001) which

concerned the conflict between an arbitral award finding in favour of a party that

involved tre arbitral tribunal also needs to consider whether the existence of

56/53

 

17/03 "96 14:21 TEL 34 91 576 97 94 B. CREMADES & ASOCIADOS @osr

A provisicn such as Article 46 that seeks to automatically suspend an arbitration
simply b:cause criminal proceedings have been commenced that require
investigation of the same facts amounts to an interference with the jurisdiction of
the arbitr:! tribunal. In the present case, the reliance by the Respondents on
Article 46 arguably amounts to the reliance of the State on its own law to defeat
an arbitrat on agreement, and this is contrary to international public policy,

§78.- In the present case the Arbitral Tribunal has found that there was a
mistake re ating to whether the paid-up capital of the Claimant amounted to £100
million, aid according the Concession Contract was void. Forgery, if proved,
would mein that the Claimant was also guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation.
However, the civil consequences of fraudulent misrepresentation under Article
125 of the Civil Code are the same as those for a mistake; that is, the contract is
void and <amages may be awarded pursuant to Article 142. On this basis, it is
unnecessaiy for the Arbitral Tribunal to make any decision on forgery or the
other criminal acts alleged, and so Article 46 has no application to the present
arbitration

§79.- There remains the question of whether the Tribunal in its discretion
should sispend these proceedings because of the criminal proceedings
commence d in Egypt. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that in the circumstances
of this ca:¢ no suspension is required, and in reaching this decision notes the
following: (i) No party to this arbitration bas been prosecuted with any criminal
offence (t! ¢ Claimant is a British company and not any of the individuals named
in the prosecution); (ii) the offences alleged are serious, and some of the
individual: involved are closely connected with the Claimant; (iii) the alleged
offences a'e closely connected with the making of the Concession Contract, and
so with the matters at issue in this arbitration; (iv) nevertheless, the Arbitral
Tribunal i: satisfied that the matters at issue in the arbitration can be decided
without making determinations as to whether the Claimant have committed
criminal a2ts of fraud, theft or criminal collusion in the breach of duty by
Egyptian ; ublic officials; (v) the Claimant opposes any suspension and (subject
to the accimmodation made to take the evidence of certain witnesses by video
conference ) considers that it can and has been fully able to present its case in this
arbitration (vi) the prosecutions did not take place immediately after the alleged
criminal ations or after the suspicion of irregularities contributed to the decision
to cancel he Concession Contract, but four years later and during an intense
phase of j.ctivity in this arbitration; (vii) the criminal proceedings are of an
indefinite ind maybe lengthy duration; (viii) a suspension of this arbitration and
consequen: delay might prejudice the Claimant in the exercise of #18\right to
arbitration in terms of uncertainty and increased costs,

VIII. DaMaces

§80.- The Claimant submitted as evidence of the loss it had suffered a
report by riceWaterhouseCoopers dated April 3, 2005. The Egyptian Holding
for Airports and the Egyptian Airports Company submitted a report in
reply by PMG Hazen Hassan, At the hearing, Mrs. Ghada Ezzat El-Feky of
PriceWate houseCoopers gave oral evidence and answered questions on behalf
of the Claimant, and Mrs. Niveen Shahine of KPMG Hazen Hassan gave oral
evidence end answered questions on behalf of the Egyptian Holding Company
for Airpor:s and the Egyptian Airports Company.

§81 - The Arbitral Tribunal has already decided that the general principle
of compensation for the Claimant in this case should be that stated in Article 142
of the Civil Code for cases of annulment of a contract. Article 142 gives the
Claimant «1 right to be ‘reinstated in their position prior to the contract’, and
where suc't reinstatement is impossible, ‘damages equivalent to the loss may be
awarded’

§82 - The Claimant's major claim in monetary terms is for loss of profits,
amounting to $US5S00,000,000. The elements and calculation of this claim have
been the s sbject of submissions and expert evidence. It includes loss of profits
from the «peration of the airport, loss of profits from the exploitation of the
airport sitt;, and loss of profits relating to freehold land (including proposed
projects sich as hotels, tourism, shopping centers and industrial agriculture).
After a cai eful review of the expert evidence, the Arbitral Tribunal has decided
that the profits of the Claimant, had the Concession Contract been performed,
would not rave exceeded $100 million.

In this cas :, however, the Arbitral Tribunal has already found that the Claimant
should have realised that the Arab Republic of Egypt was entering into the
Concession Contract under the influence of an essential mistake, The Arbitral
Tribunal tas already found that the responsibility of the Claimant for this
mistake artounted to ninety percent. Accordingly, the damages for lost profit
must be reduced by this percentage. The resulting figure of $US 10 million is
according! ¢ awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal in the concept of lost profits.

The Claimant also seeks moral damages of $US1,000,000. Moral damages may
be claimeil under Article 222 of the Civil Code, and here are based on the
allegation that the purpose of the Respondents’ behaviour was fame and
affect the (laimant’s reputation, The Tribunal does not accept that the purpose of

07/03 ‘06 14:22 TEL 34 91 576 97 94 B. CREMADES & ASOCTADOS Boss

effect of tite conduct of the Arab Republic of Egypt justifies any award of moral
damages, ind notes in this regard its earlier finding that the Arab Republic of
Egypt exe:cised its power to cancel the Concession Contract for economic and
security reasons. Accordingly, damages under this heading are refused.

§83.- As regards the claim for the return of the letters of guarantee,
damages o the amount of the present value of these letters of guarantee
(estimated by the Claimant's expert witness as $US564,069.00 and by the
Respondenits' expert witness as SUSS14,000.00), clearly fall within the principle
of damagcs equivalent to reinstatement. However, the Republic of Egypt relies
upon Artic le 26 of the Law N° 89 of 1998 in connection with Tenders and Bids
which sp-zcifically authorises the confiscation of performance bonds in
circumstat ces such as the present. Accordingly, Egypt has established a legal
right to retain this sum and the Claimant's claim under this heading is denied.

§84.- There remains the claims for the Claimant's expenses, invoices, and
the salaries of its employees amounting to $US12,416,574.00 consisting of (i)
claim for general expenses (SUS1,704,370); (ii) expenses for four invoices
(SUS2,11:,204); (iii) salaries (SUS8,597,000).

§85,- As regards the first of these claims, the KPMG Hazen Hassan report
submits, aad the Arbitral Tribunal accepts, that these expenses should only be
calculated for the period of 1999 to 2001 (and not to 2004 as claimed) resulting
in a figure of $USS62,793,

As regirds the four invoices totalling $US2,115,204, the
Price Wate thouseCoopers report submitted by the Claimant does not explain the
nature of these expenses. It simply states, after discussing the gencral expenses
referred to above, that «additionally, copies of four invoices sum up to an amount
of SUS2,113,204 were presented to us by Malicorp. Malicorp will provide the
original ix,voices on request». The Respondents made no submissions in respect
of these invoices, its own expert report did not refer to them, and they were only
raised in passing during the searching cross-examination of Mrs. Ghada Ezzat El-
Feky of Price WaterhouseCoopers by counsel for the Respondents at the hearing.
On the ba:is of the uncontradicted evidence of the existence of four invoices to
this amouat, offered for review to the Respondents, the Arbitral Tribunal
considers that this element of the claim is proved.

In contras,, the claim for salaries was challenged by the Respondents in cross-
examinati( n, Mr Hafez (on behalf of the State Law Suits Authority) questioned
the reason tbleness and coherence of the alleged payments. Mrs. Ghada Ezzat El-

07/03 "06 14:22 TEL 34 91 S76 97 94 B. CREMADES & AsocraDOS Boco

Feky of J riceWaterhouseCoopers referred to the assumptions expressed in the
report. The assumptions within the report shows that such agreements exist, but
specifically disclaims any review of the ‘reasonableness’ of these contracts. The
Arbitral Tribunal, applying the principle in Article 142, finds that the Claimant
should on y recover the costs for the period between the signing of the Heads of
Agreemert and the termination of the Concession Contract (that is,

circumstances of the arbitration in reaching a decision on costs, and particularly
the following: (i) The Claimant has largely succeeded on the procedural and
Jurisdictio ral issues raised in this arbitration; (ii) The Claimant's ambiguous
manner 0! identifying the Parties in this arbitration has contributed to increased
costs in this arbitration; (iii) The Respondents have successfully established that
the Repub ic of Egypt had a right to cancel the Concession Contract and also that
the Conce ision Contract was null and void for fraudulent mistepresentation; (iv)
The Clairzant has established a right to compensation notwithstanding the
cancellatic n and nullity of the Concession Contract.

and the R :spondents on the other shall each bear one half of all the fees, costs
and expenses of the arbitration, and each party shall remain responsible for its
own legal costs.

to the Claimant ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-SEVEN THOUSAND AND FIFTY UNITED
STATES DOLLARS (SUS 147,050.00), being the part of the Respondents’ half
