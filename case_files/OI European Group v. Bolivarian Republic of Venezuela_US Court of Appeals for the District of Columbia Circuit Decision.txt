v.
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,

Appellant

BEFORE:  Tatel, Millett, and Pillard, Circuit Judges
ORDER

Upon consideration of the pro se application filed by Reinaldo Enrique Mufioz
Pedroza, and the response thereto (captioned as “Reply in Support of Motion to
Strike”), which contains a request to strike the pro se application, it is

ORDERED that the pro se application be denied. The application includes a
request by the administration of Nicolas Maduro to bar Juan Guaido and his
representatives from arguing this appeal on behalf of Venezuela. On January 23, 2019,
the Executive Branch of the United States recognized Guaido as the Interim President
of Venezuela. "What government is to be regarded here as representative of a foreign
state is a political rather than a judicial question, and is to be determined by the political
department of the government." Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, 304 U.S. 126,
137 (1938). The executive branch's "action in recognizing a foreign government . . . is
conclusive on all domestic courts, which are bound to accept that determination... ."
Id. at 138. Furthermore, "the rights of a sovereign state are vested in the state rather
than in any particular government which may purport to represent it, and . . . suit in its
behalf may be maintained in our courts only by that government which has been
recognized by the political department of our government as the authorized government
of the foreign state." Id. at 137; see also Pfizer, Inc. v. Government of India, 434 U.S.
308, 319-20 ("It has long been established that only governments recognized by the
United States . . . are entitled to access to our courts ...."). Itis

FURTHER ORDERED that the request to strike the pro se application be denied.
