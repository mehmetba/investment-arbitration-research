conference call held on January 17, 2011.

By letter dated January 20, 2011 (Gal 67), the Claimant submitted the affidavit of
Ms. Anna Viggers and provided comments on the issue of the forensic reports and
the witnesses.

By e-mail sent on January 21, 2011, the Respondent noted that it had received the
Claimant’s submission and witness statement and informed the Arbitral Tribunal
of its objection to the Claimant's proposal to submit a new fact witness on the
grounds that this was a late submission not contemplated by the procedural order
governing the hearing. The Respondent also advised that it would be filing a
formal objection by the next day, and further requested that the Arbitral Tribunal
refrain from reviewing the new witness statement until it had an opportunity to
review the Respondent’s formal objection.

By e-mail sent on January 21, 2011 (Gal 68), the Claimant submitted the Deloitte
Report dated January 1, 2011.

By letter dated January 21, 2011 (Can 68), the Respondent provided a response to
the Claimant’s submission of January 20, 2011, and requested that the Claimant’s
new evidence and witness introduced therein be excluded from the upcoming
jurisdictional hearing. The Respondent requested that, in the alternative, the
hearing be postponed at the Claimant’s expense to accommodate his new witness
and evidence.

By letter dated January 21, 2011 (Gal 69), the Claimant provided comments to the
Respondent’s letter Can 68 and argued that the Arbitral Tribunal should admit
Ms. Viggers’ witness statement.

By letter dated January 22, 2011 (Gal 70), the Claimant proposed a schedule with
the order for the calling of his witness and on the same day he informed the
Arbitral Tribunal that Mr. Bain had executed a second witness statement, which
will filed as part of the Claimant’s reply evidence submission on January 25, 2011
and that therefore, it would not be necessary for Mr. Bain to attend the hearing for
examination on his first statement.

By letter dated January 25, 2011 (Gal 71), the Claimant submitted the expert
report of Dr. Aginsky.

By letter dated January 26, 2011 (A 37), the Arbitral Tribunal informed the
Parties of its decision to admit Ms. Viggers’ affidavit and summoned her to the

hearing to be examined on those factual issues that the Claimant felt required
additional evidence.

107. By e-mail sent on January 27, 2011, the Respondent requested that the Arbitral
Tribunal summon Mr. Bain to testify following the examination of Mr. Belardi on
January 31, 2011. The Respondent noted according to the Claimant’s e-mail of
January 22, 2011, that the Claimant had no objection to such examination. By e-
mail sent on January 28, 2011 (A 38), the Arbitral Tribunal confirmed that
Mr. Bain would be summoned on January 31, 2011, following the testimony of
Mr. Belardi. The Arbitral Tribunal invited the Respondent to take the necessary
steps to guarantee the presence of the witness.

108. From 31 January through 4 February 2011 a hearing was held in Toronto on the
jurisdictional issues.

109.

Ss

By letter dated February 11, 2011 (Can 70), the Respondent informed the Arbitral
Tribunal that it did not believe that the submission of additional expert opinion
evidence by Professor Welling was warranted and that it was its intention to fully
address Professor Welling’s assertions in its post-hearing submission by referring
to relevant Canadian legal authorities. The Respondent further noted that the
Claimant’s request for the production of his original US income tax returns had
been rejected by the US Internal Revenue Service and that the Claimant had
indicated that he will resubmit this request to the US Internal Revenue Service as
soon as possible.

110. By e-mails sent on April 8, 2011, the parties submitted their Post-Hearing Brief
on Jurisdiction.

111.

By letter dated April 21, 2011 (Gal 77), the Claimant requested that the Arbitral
Tribunal give it the opportunity to reply to the Respondent’s new evidence
submitted in the form of Canadian jurisprudence and to permit Prof. Welling to
address other new cases introduced by the Respondent in its Post Hearing
Submission.

112. By letter dated April 28, 2011 (Can 71), the Respondent opposed to the
Claimant’s request to submit a supplemental witness statement from Prof.
Welling responding to certain Canadian court cases referred to in Canada’s Post
Hearing Submission.

113. By letter dated April 29, 2011 (Can 72), the Respondent provided a response to
the Claimant’s request that the transcript of the hearing on jurisdiction not be
published, maintaining that the Arbitral Tribunal should allow publication in light
of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and under the circumstances of the case, and
public policy considerations.

By letter dated April 29, 2011 (Gal 78), the Claimant provided a response to the
Respondent’s letter Can 72 and its request to publish the transcripts of oral
hearings in the matter.

By letter dated May 4, 2011 (A 38), the Arbitral Tribunal informed the Parties
that it dismissed the Claimant’s request with regard to the supplementary witness
statement from Prof. Welling. The Arbitral Tribunal noted that if, during the
course of this arbitration, the Arbitral Tribunal felt that further opinion on the
available Canadian case law be needed, it would ask the Claimant to produce
evidence and provide the Respondent with an opportunity to counter such
evidence.

On August 30, 2011, the PCA, on behalf of the Arbitral Tribunal, circulated
Procedural Order no. 6 on the publicity of the hearing transcripts.

By letter dated September 9, 2011 (Can 73/Gallo 80) the parties jointly informed
the Arbitral Tribunal that the Forms 5471, which had been requested from the IRS
in accordance with the Tribunal’s communication A 31, could not be produced by
the IRS, and that the parties looked forward to the release of the Award on
September, 15.

The Arbitral Tribunal held deliberations in writing and through conference calls,
in order to reach an agreement on the decisions taken in this Award.

TV. INTRODUCTION

119. In its decision A 30, the Arbitral Tribunal decided to bifurcate the proceedings
and to open a Separate Procedure to address all jurisdictional objections raised by
the Respondent, including the Claimant’s legal standing. This Award adjudicates
these jurisdictional objections, and concludes that the Claimant lacks legal
standing, and the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide the claims submitted by
Mr. Vito G. Gallo.

120.

Ss

The issue before the Tribunal can be described, in a nutshell, as follows:

121.

On September 6, 2002 a Canadian company called 1532382 Ontario Inc. [the
“Enterprise”] signed a purchase agreement for an abandoned mine in Ontario
known as the “Adams Mine”, which already had certain administrative approvals
required for its use as a waste disposal site. Two years later, on April 5, 2004 the
Ontario legislature passed the so called Adams Mine Lake Act [“AMLA”],
prohibiting the disposal of waste at the Adams Mine, revoking the existing
approvals and providing for limited compensation in favour of the Enterprise. The
Claimant, Mr. Vito G. Gallo, an American citizen, avers that, at the time when the
AMLA was promulgated, he owned and controlled the Enterprise, which suffered
significant damages as a result of this legislation, which he estimates at Canadian
Dollar [“C$”] 105 million. He seeks compensation for that damage, reasoning that
by enacting the AMLA Canada violated NAFTA Arts. 1105° and 1110° and
customary international law’.

122. Canada denies that prior to the introduction of the AMLA Mr. Gallo was the
owner of the Enterprise and an investor under the NAFTA, because there is no
reliable contemporaneous evidence proving these allegations: the Claimant did
not act as the owner of the Enterprise, took no interest in the risks and rewards of
ownership, and it was in fact a wealthy Canadian real estate developer, Mr. Mario
Cortellucci, rather than the Claimant, who organised, negotiated and assumed all
the risks of purchasing the Adams Mine and was its real owner’.

123. The Respondent’s defence is, thus, essentially fact driven; the Tribunal’s first task
is to analyse the facts, and to weigh the extensive evidence submitted by both
parties.

V. POSITION OF THE PARTIES

 

1. THE CLAIMANT’S CASE

 

124. The Claimant submits that he is an American citizen who resides in Pennsylvania
and that he has been the owner of the Enterprise since 2002.

Ownership of the Enterprise

125. The Shareholders Register of the Enterprise, contained in the corporation’s
Minute Book, confirms that Mr. Gallo is its sole shareholder. As Prof. Welling,
the Claimant’s legal expert explained, under Ontario law Mr. Gallo controls the
Enterprise, being the only Person authorised to appoint the directors or issue

As an ion of
international law, the sole shareholder of a corporation also is the | owner of such
corporation’. This was the conclusion of the Tribunal in the Yukos Trilogy of
Energy Charter Treaty [“ECT”] claims against the Russian Federation, which
concerned treaty language identical to Art. 1117 of the NAFTA’.

 

126. Prof. Welling also testified that the Enterprise’s corporate record satisfies the
statutory requirements and that the Courts of Ontario are the only courts vested
with authority to determine the authenticity of corporate records'®. Absent
compelling documentary or forensic evidence to the contrary, an Ontario court
would accept the Enterprise’s share register as conclusive evidence of Mr. Gallo’s
status.

127. The Claimant alleges that he has clearly demonstrated that he exercises legal
control over the Enterprise, as a matter of applicable law and that he has done so
since the Enterprise was established in 2002. As found by the Thunderbird'*
Tribunal, proof of legal control under applicable law also presumptively satisfies
the definition of “control” under Art. 1117 of the NAFTA”.

128. Mr. Gallo’s ownership and control of the Enterprise were established in 2002 —
long before the Government of Ontario effectively took away the right to use the
Adams Mine as a waste facility. But, subsidiarily, the Claimant alleges that
Art. 1117 permits an investor of a NAFTA party to bring a claim on behalf of an
investment enterprise that it owns or controls without any limitation as to when
such ownership or control of the enterprise began. If there are bona fide

commercial reasons for obtaining ownership or control of an enterprise that just
so happened to be nursing a nascent NAFTA claim, there is nothing in Art. 1117
that would prevent a claim from being made on the enterprise’s behalf — as long
as ownership or control was transferred to a person who qualified as an “investor
of a NAFTA Party”,

129. The Claimant adds that the agreements entered into by the Enterprise in order to
finance and manage the Adams Mine do not have any bearing on Mr. Gallo’s

ownership or control. Directors have the authority to sign documents on behalf of
the Enterprise, and consequently [i=pXegt=p)
REDACTED lare consistent with the

 

applicable law and cannot possibly affect the Tribunal’s determination of whether
Mr. Gallo owned or controlled the Enterprise within the meaning of Art. 1117 of
the NAFTA". Mr. Gallo did not lose control of the Enterprise, because he chose a
financing model that included access to local funds. Prof. Welling also confirmed
[UEREDACTED

REDACTED

ae was valid under Ontario law. The Claimant submits that a corporation

like the Enterprise is allowed to enter into
REDACTED d/or to grant agents the authority to manage its business
however it sees fit™”.

   
    

130. The Claimant adds that the EG] Agreement (which provides for the sale of
the Mine site) also fails to demonstrate that Mr. Gallo did not own or control the
Enterprise. As Prof. Welling confirmed, it was within Mr. Cortellucci’s authority,
as a matter of common law, to take the initiative and enter into such agreement on
behalf of the Enterprise. If U=@¥XegfSM had actually been successful in locating a
suitable purchaser, the SeyXe¥ Agreement did not dictate how the proceeds from
the sale of the Adams Mine would be distributed, not without first obtaining the
approval of Mr. Gallo'’. A shareholder vote would be required before the
ownership of the Adams Mine could be sold and the Enterprise would have been

the sole beneficiary of any such sale'®,

Mr. Gallo’s contribution

131.

Claimant acknowledges that he has made no financial contribution to the project.
But in his opinion, the origin of funds used to develop an investment is simply not
relevant, as the Tribunal in Siag & Vecchi has confirmed'’. And there is nothing
improper or unusual in funding an entrepreneurial venture through a limited
partnership arrangement, as Prof. Welling confirmed. The limited partnership

structure provided the potential for an immediate tax deduction to the limited
partners investing funds, thereby reducing the cost of capital. Mr. Gallo did not
lose control of the Enterprise because he chose a financing model that included
access to local funds”®. For good reason, the NAFTA Parties put no limitations on
how investment could be financed. Arbitrarily constraining the sources of capital
required to qualify an investment as foreign would run directly contrary to the
stated objectives of the NAFTA.

132. Mr. Gallo’s primary contribution to the project was his ability to secure the
support of interested and experienced investors and/or buyers from the US, once
the site was made ready for construction”!

Art. 1117 of the NAFTA

133. Mr. Gallo is bringing this procedure pursuant to Art. 1117 of the NAFTA on
behalf of the Enterprise — not on his own behalf. This is why he is not making a
claim under Art. 1116 of the NAFTA. The purpose of Art. 1117 of the NAFTA is
to escape the customary international law paradigm adopted by the International
Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction decision, and to permit claims to be
brought on behalf of investment enterprises incorporated under the laws of the
host state’. When an Art. 1117 claim is pursued, the claimant is not allowed to
collect the damages himself, and these must flow to the investment enterprise.
What the enterprise chooses to do with the proceeds of a damages award is not
relevant to these proceedings. The investment enterprise would be at liberty to
dispose of the proceeds of the award as it sees fit”.

134. Art. 1139 of the NAFTA defines an “investor of a Party” as a national of a
NAFTA Party who “seeks to make, is making or has made an investment”.
Art. 1139 defines “investment” as including “an enterprise” and Art. 201 of the
NAFTA defines an “enterprise” as including a corporation “organised under
applicable law”. It is undisputed that the Enterprise is an entity constituted under
the laws of Ontario, and the laws of Ontario are the “applicable law”.

135. From the moment Mr. Gallo decided to establish the Enterprise and have it
acquire the Adams Mine site, he became for the purposes of the NAFTA an
“investor of a Party”, because he was at that point seeking to make an investment.
From the moment Mr. Gallo became the owner of the Enterprise, he qualified as
an “investor of a Party” because he had made an investment in Canada.

136. The Claimant adds that the Respondent cannot be permitted to benefit from the
alacrity with which Ontario acted against the Enterprise, namely to stop it from
making use of a valuable piece of permitted land as a waste facility. Such result
would be inequitable, not only because it would allow the Respondent to benefit

from its own wrongdoing, but also because its argument misses the point of the
claim before this Tribunal: as of the date it was taken from the Enterprise, the
Adams Mine site was a highly valuable asset and worth a great deal of money as a
permitted waste landfill’*.

137. The Claimant avers that he has met the burden to prove jurisdiction, and requests
that the claim should now proceed to the merits”>.

2. THE RESPONDENT’S CASE

138.

oo

The Respondent starts its allegations submitting that a claimant in an investment
arbitration bears the burden of proving that the tribunal has jurisdiction to hear its
claims, including the facts on which it relies. Where the claimant has failed to
prove those facts, tribunals have ruled that they do not have jurisdiction”, as the
Tribunals in Soufraki?”, Cementownia’® and Europe Cement” have decided. In
the instant case, the Claimant has alleged that Canada bears the burden of
evidence, because the Claimant asserts that the Respondent has alleged that he is
part of a “fraudulent conspiracy” and that therefore the burden of proof should be
shifted to Canada. In fact, Mr. Gallo is mischaracterising Canada’s objection to
jurisdiction: the Respondent is not alleging that the Claimant engaged in a
fraudulent conspiracy, but simply that he has not adduced sufficient proof to
establish jurisdiction”’.

139. In order for the Claimant to establish that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear his
claims in respect of the AMLA, he must prove that he owned the Enterprise prior
to the introduction of the AMLA in April 2004, and he must do so through
reliable and contemporaneous documents’'. Mr. Gallo has failed to discharge this
burden. There is no documentary evidence of his ownership, no single document
executed prior to the introduction of the AMLA which bears his signature.
Indeed, the Claimant has failed to even produce a single piece of
contemporaneous evidence that reliably links him in any way with the Enterprise
prior to the introduction of the AMLA™. There is no documentary evidence
supporting that he was involved:

- In the purchase of the Adams Mine;
- In the establishment or organisation of the Enterprise;
- In the Enterprise’s acquisition of the Adams Mine;

- In the efforts to sell the Adams Mine;

- In the raising of funds for the development of the mine;
- In the litigation affecting the Enterprise;

- In the negotiations for compensation under the AMLA.

140. Furthermore, none of the explanations provided by the Claimant to justify the
absence of documentary evidence are satisfactory®>.

141,

The Respondent also submits that neither the Enterprise’s tax filings nor those of
the Claimant constitute contemporaneous and reliable evidence that the Claimant
owned the Enterprise prior to the AMLA™. Both the Claimant and the Enterprise
failed to file with the tax authorities before enactment of the AMLA any tax

declaration stating that Mr. Gallo was the_owner of the Enterprise. And the tax
return eventually filed by the Enterprise [N=apyXeau=ie)

142, The Claimant also failed to make the regulatory filings required to indicate his
ownership of the Enterprise prior to the AMLA, both to the US Department of
Treasury and to the Canadian government.

we

As regards the Enterprise’s corporate documents, the Respondent alleges that the
dates on such documents are unreliable, that several documents are missing from
the Minute Book and that the witness statements presented by the Claimant are
insufficient to establish that Mr. Gallo owned the Enterprise prior to the AMLA.

Lack of contribution

145.

a

Pursuant to NAFTA Article 1139, to be an “investment of an investor of a Party”
it is necessary that the investment be “owned or controlled directly or indirectly
by an investor of such Party”. However, while ownership or control is necessary,
it is not sufficient. This is made clear by the definition of an “investor of a Party”
which imposes the additional requirement that the individual “seeks to make, is
making or has made” the investment in question. An investment is made by an
investor only where there is a commitment of resources to the economy of the
host state by the claimant entailing the assumption of risk. In this case Mr. Gallo:

- Did not pay ETS «0 acquire the Enterprise or the Adams Mine;

- Did not pay a single expense;

- Did not loan any money to the Enterprise;

: Did not contribute any technical, management or other expertise to the
Enterprise;

- Did not bear any risk should the Enterprise fail;

- Did not stand to gain if the Enterprise succeeded in selling Adams Mine.

Abuse of right
146.

a

The Respondent, subsidiarily, alleges that there is an abuse of right, which
deprives the Claimant of legal standing. Mr. Gallo is using Article 1117 of the
NAFTA to bring a claim on behalf of a Canadian investment to which neither he
nor any other non-Canadian contributed. This is not the purpose of this article,
whichis intended to give a right to a foreign investor to claim on behalf of a
foreign investment. In light of the lack of contribution by the Claimant or
assumption of any risk, the guid pro quo between the foreign investor and the host
state, which is the cornerstone for the system of investment treaty arbitration,
does not exist. This claim harms Canada, which has received no foreign
investment in return for conveying the right on which the Claimant now relies.
Since the Claimant has harmed others by using a right for a purpose other than
that for which it was created, the Claimant has abused that right”.

147.

x

The Respondent requests that the Tribunal dismiss the Claimant’s claims in their
entirety and with prejudice and order that the Claimant bear the costs of this
arbitration, including Canada’s costs for legal representation and assistance, the
Respondent expressly reserving its rights to make a submission on the costs to
which it alleges to be entitled*.

VI. Facts

1. DRAMATIS RES ET PERSONAE

148. The Adams Mine site is located in Northern Ontario, within the Township of
Boston. It is a former iron mine, which began operation in 1964 and closed in
1990. The ore was shipped by train from a rail head on the site’®. In 1999, and
after many efforts, the then owner of the Adams Mine, Notre Development
Corporation [“Notre”], obtained a Certificate of Approval, which authorised the
use of the mine for the storage of non-hazardous waste, with a capacity of
1,341,600 tons per year, up to a total of 21.9 million cubic meters”.

Vito Gallo

149, The Claimant is Mr. Vito G. Gallo [“Mr. Gallo”], an American citizen resident in
Pennsylvania. He holds a Degree in Business Management and a Juris Doctor. On
September 9, 2002, when allegedly he became the sole owner of the Enterprise
which owned the Adams Mine, he was a 33 year old government employee, who
had recently become Senior Policy Director in the Pennsylvania Governor’s
Policy Office’. Mr. Gallo is currently Assistant Vice-President for State
Government Relations at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, and it is his
responsibility to obtain funding from public and private sources for research and
education programs“. He has no track record as investor or as entrepreneur, and
no direct knowledge of or experience in the waste management industry’.

Mari

 

rtellucci

150. Mr. Mario Cortellucci [“Mr. Cortellucci”] is a key player in the facts surrounding
the Adams Mine. He was born in Italy in 1949 and immigrated to Canada at the
age of 13, becoming in due course a wealthy and prominent real estate developer
and entrepreneur in Ontario and other parts of Canada. It was he who learnt that
an opportunity existed for somebody to acquire the right to use the Adams Mine
as a permitted waste landfill, and it was he who negotiated the transaction and
financed the deal**. One of Mr. Cortellucci’s business associates and partner in
numerous ventures is Mr. Saverio Montemarano, who also participated in the

Besides his role as legal advisor both for Mr. Gallo and Mr. Cortellucci,
Mr. Swanick also assumed the position of sole director and officer of the
Enterprise, and of a special purpose corporation which holds the legal title to the
partnership units owned by Mr. Cortellucci and his partners™.

154. In 2002, Ms. Anne Viggers was the secretary to Mr. Swanick. She was the person
who actually recorded in the shareholder register of the Enterprise that the
shareholding had been transferred to Mr. Gallo. Ms. Viggers left her employment
at some moment after the passage of the AMLA.

2. THE PURCHASE OF THE ADAMS MINE

15.

“

Before the purchase of the Adams Mine, there had been almost no contact
between Mr. Gallo and Mr. Cortellucci. They had only once met face to face, in
the summer of 2001, at a social function®® — Mr. Gallo a young American civil
servant, without any business experience in the waste management industry,

Mr. Cortellucci a well-connected and wealthy entrepreneur with interests in real
estate development and other sectors. Mr. Gallo submits that in the course of this
meeting, he told Mr. Cortellucci about his idea that it was the right time to invest
in the Ontario waste industry, and that he had contacts among American waste
site developers in Pennsylvania™. Mr. Cortellucci reacted, promising Mr. Gallo
that he would keep an eye out for any opportunity®>.

156. While the only evidence of this first meeting between Mr. Gallo and
Mr. Cortellucci is their own testimony, there is a clear documentary record that
proves that six months thereafter, in early 2002, Notre, the then owner of the
Adams Mine, approached Mr. Cortellucci — not Mr. Gallo — to enquire whether he
would be willing to finance or participate in the development of the project.
Mr. Cortellucci, an important political donor and a personality well connected to
local and provincial government, was seen as the right person to assist in the
highly-regulated and politically charged field of waste management®’. During the
next few months it was Mr. Cortellucci — without any involvement of Mr. Gallo —
who negotiated with Mr. Gordon McGuinty, Notre’s main shareholder and
manager. These negotiations led to a successful conclusion, and on May 10, 2002
an Agreement of Purchase and Sale*’ involving the Adams Mine {the “Purchase
Agreement”] was signed.

157. Who were the parties to this Purchase Agreement?

158. There is no doubt surrounding the seller, Notre, the company owning the Adams
Mine, which had invested time and effort to obtain the necessary authorisations to

convert the old mine into a permitted waste disposal site.

Purchase pt

160. In accordance with the Purchase Agreement, Notre agreed to transfer to the
Cortellucci Group the Adams Mine for a purchase price of C$ 1.8 million, plus
payment of the outstanding realty taxes on the mine. The purchaser also agreed to
pay to Mr. McGuinty, Notre’s manager and shareholder, C$ 1.25 million over a
five year period in return for a non-competition and consulting agreement™. In
total, signature of the Purchase Agreement committed the Cortellucci Group to
C$ 3.25 million in unconditional payments (and significant additional variable fee
payments, once the Adams Mine started operating).

Was Mr. Cortellucci Claimant’s agent?

161.

The Claimant alleges that, although formally the negotiations which led to the
purchase of the Adams Mine, were undertaken by Mr. Cortellucci, in actual fact
Mr. Cortellucci was acting on the Claimant’s behalf: Mr. Cortellucci was
Mr. Gallo’s agent®’. Although no written agreement has been produced, Mr. Gallo
and Mr. Cortellucci submit that the contractual relationship was established
orally, over the telephone”, Mr. Cortellucci adding that this is his preferred
business practice — a simple hand shake with people he believes he can trust”
There is thus no doubt that Mr. Cortellucci and Mr. Gallo must have entered into
some sort of agreement [the “Cortellucci-Gallo Agreement”); however, since
there is no written record of such agreement and there is a lack of any other
evidence, it is impossible to establish when such Agreement was entered into; it
may have been in 2002 or thereafter, and before or after the introduction of the
AMLA. Mr. Gallo and Mr. Cortellucci additionally aver that the Cortellucci-Gallo
Agreement created an agency relationship, in which Mr. Gallo was the principal
and Mr. Cortellucci was his agent.

The alleged Cortellucci-Gallo Agreement is surrounded by unusual features.
Absence of written evidence

163.

oO

(i) The first problem which the Tribunal faces is that there is no written evidence,
direct or circumstantial, which supports the oral depositions now being made by
Mr. Gallo and Mr. Cortellucci. The record shows that in other circumstances,
Mr. Cortellucci was rather diligent in the written formalization of his agreements.
For example, when he recorded the agreements lSB/@gNS2)

   
  
  

 

 
 

he chose to do so in rather detailed and technically complex
documents, which have been duly presented in this procedure. This contrasts with

the Cortellucci-Gallo Agreement, in which Mr. Cortellucci allegedly accepted to
act as Mr. Gallo’s agent, in a business as contentious and risky as waste
management disposal, simply on the basis of a “hand shake”. The Tribunal
acknowledges that sometimes businessmen rely on trust, and do not formalise
their agreements in writing. But these situations typically arise when the partners
know each other well, have undertaken together a number of transactions, and
have learnt to trust each other. None of these conditions existed in the relationship
between Mr. Gallo and Mr. Cortellucci.

Absence of personal involvements

164.

(ii) Mr. Gallo has admitted that he never visited the Adams Mine, before or after
the signing of the Purchase Agreement™, that he never did any due diligence, nor
engaged any engineer or consultant to do a due diligence®, that he never saw any
documentation referring to the mine, not even the Certificate of Approval which
authorised its use as a waste disposal facility. According to the Claimant, he
entrusted to Mr. Cortellucci every single aspect in the negotiation of the complex
multi-million purchase of the Adams Mine.

165. Mr. Cortellucci accepted to sign an agreement implying unconditional payments
of at least C$ 3,25 million and requiring additional investments amounting to tens
of millions of C$ without any written instruction. Mr. Cortellucci did a i
acting in his own name and assuming vis-a-vis third parties full responsibi
secretly being the agent of an American civil servant with unknown wherewithals,
whom he had only met at a social function, who never visited the Adams Mine,
with whom he only communicated through a few telephone conversations, and
with whom he never established a written contract.

   

Absence of circumstantial evidence

166.

a

(iii) An additional surprising element is that, further to the fact that the
Cortellucci-Gallo Agreement was never formalized in writing, there is a total lack
of any type of written communication between Mr. Gallo and Mr. Cortellucci.
Mr. Cortellucci never sent a single e-mail, fax or letter, any negotiating
documents, any drafts of the purchase agreement, any materials on the Adams
Mine”, or any copy of the actual Purchase Agreement to Mr. Gallo®’. Similarly,
there is no written evidence that Mr. Gallo ever sent any written instruction to
Mr. Cortellucci.

HT 1, p. 232.

HT I, ps. 232 — 233 and 235.

© Mr. Gallo stated for the first time during the hearing that he did receive a short presentation on the
Adams Mine from Mr. Cortellucci (HT 1, p. 225). This fact was not mentioned in his WS, and Mr. Gallo
either did not keep a copy of the presentation or subsequently lost it, and has been unable to produce it
(HT 1, p. 227).

*’ CMeml, para. 34. Mr. Gallo testified that he had reviewed the Purchase Agreement before it was
signed (HT 1, p. 242), but Mr. Cortellucci admitted that he neither sent Mr. Gallo drafts of the Purchase
Agreement (HT 4, p. 138) nor a copy of it before he signed (HT 4, p. 138).

No revelation of Mr. Gallo’s identity

(iv) The existence of the Cortellucci-Gallo Agreement and the fact that Mr. Gallo
was the principal, and Mr. Cortellucci the agent acting on his behalf, was never
revealed to any independent third party before the enactment of the AMLA.

It is especially surprising that Mr. Gallo’s identity was never disclosed to the
vendor, Mr. McGuinty, who throughout this period believed that it was the
Cortellucci group which was purchasing the Adams Mine — a supposition which
made sense, because it was Mr. Cortellucci who had first been approached as a
possible purchaser and had the political contacts which could be helpful for the
successful development of the waste disposal facility®®. After the purchase of the
Mine, Mr. Cortellucci entrusted its former owner, Mr. McGuinty, with the day to
day management of the site. But the existence of Mr. Gallo, and the fact that
Mr. Cortellucci was not the actual owner, but merely the agent of a US owner,
was kept secret from Mr. McGuinty. It was only after the promulgation of AMLA
that the existence of a US investor, on whose behalf Mr. Cortellucci was acting,
became public knowledge.

Mr. Gallo has tried to explain this secrecy, stating that if Mr. McGuinty had
believed that a US citizen was interested in the site, he would have driven up the
price. The argument is unconvincing, because the participation in the deal of a 33
year old civil servant from Pennsylvania would in any case have been eclipsed by
the presence of Mr. Cortellucci, a wealthy and well-connected local millionaire
who was providing the money. Mr. Gallo has offered a second argument: he was

d that publicity regarding his hip of a waste facility
in Ontario would have a negative impact upon his position as a policy officer for
the Governor of Pennsylvania®. But this reason can only justify the secrecy until
February 2003, when he left the Governor’s office, but not that it was kept until
the approval of the AMLA in 2004,

 

3. INCORPORATION OF THE ENTERPRISE

The Cortellucci group signed the Purchase Agreement of the Adams Mine on
May 10, 2002, and shortly thereafter, on June 26, 2002, Mr. Swanick,
IRREDACTED incorporated the Enterpri
company which was to act as purchasing vehicle”. At the time of incorporation,
Mr. Swanick was appointed President, Secretary and Director of the Enterprise,
his offices were listed as the business address and he received the single common

Mr. Swanick was the initial incorporator, director, officer and only shareholder of
the Enterprise”!.

171. This is as far as the undisputed facts surrounding the incorporation of the
Enterprise go.
172. All other facts, and especially if and when ownership of the Enterprise was

acquired by Mr. Gallo, have been the subject of fierce debate among the parties
and their experts, the Claimant submitting that on September 9, 2002 Mr.
Swanick transferred the share which represents the capital of the Enterprise to Mr.
Gallo, while the Respondent alleges that there is no certainty that the transfer took
place in such manner and on such date.

Scarcity of written evidence

173. The debate is fueled by the scarcity of written evidence. Claimant's allegation that
Mr. Gallo acquired ownership of the Enterprise in 2002 is founded on the
depositions as witnesses of Messrs. Gallo, Cortellucci and Swanick and
Ms. Viggers. The Respondent has stressed that these testimonies have been
provided by interested parties and that there is no written evidence confirming
these allegations.

174. In fact, the only contemporaneous documentary evidence in the file, which
provides evidence of the Claimant's case, is a single hand written, non-signed line
in the shareholders register of the Enterprise, plus two share certificates signed by
Mr. Swanick, the endorsement transfer of the share to Gallo signed by
Mr. Swanick, the Resolution of the Director transferring this share to Gallo and
the Declaration of Trust for Mr. Gallo allegedly signed on June 26, 2002 by
Mr. Swanick. No further written evidence has been produced, corroborating that
before enactment of the AMLA Mr. Gallo already was the owner of the
Enterprise:

- No document bearing Mr. Gallo’s signature;

- No agreement, no deed, no letter, no e mail, no written instruction;

- No bank transfer; ;

- No commercial registry entry;

- No certificate from any authority;

- Not even an invoice from Mr. Swanick in which Mr. Gallo’s name
appears”.

There are also no contemporaneous
- Shareholders resolutions;

- Tax returns;

”' Hearing Transcript, Day 5 [“HT 5°], p. 24.
” This has been specifically confirmed by Mr. Swanick: HT 2, ps. 298 — 299.
PCA 55798 - NAFTA Gallo v Canada

Gallo v. Canada
Page 32 of 73

- Official documents of any kind
in relation to the Enterprise, which bear Mr. Gallo’s name or signature.

175. In order to settle the debate between the parties, and weigh the available evidence,
the Tribunal will proceed chronologically, separating for each date those facts
which can be deemed proven and those which cannot.

A. June 26, 2002

176. It is a proven fact that on this date Mr. Swanick incorporated the Enterprise — as
shown by the Master Business Licence”, issued by the Ministry of Consumer and
Business Services of Ontario, with its attached Articles of Incorporation”. But
this official Licence only includes references to Mr. Swanick — he is the only
shareholder, the only officer and the only person whose name appears. There is no
specific mention that Mr. Swanick was acting “in trust” for a third person, nor is
there any reference whatsoever to Mr. Gallo.

178. Mr. Swanick and Mr. Gallo have tried to explain this lack of paper trail, arguing
that YpyNews their subsequent communications
took place exclusively over the phone. This explanation, however, is inconsistent
with two other pieces of evidence:

there is however no reference at

179. Another surprising fact is that, while there are no letters or emails exchanged
between Mr. Swanick and Mr. Gallo before the AMLA, there is evidence that in
2008 — after the AMLA — Mr. Swanick emailed certain corporate resolutions for

Mr. Gallo’s signature®’,

Content of the Minute Book

180. Further to the Master Business Licence and the Articles of Association, the
Minute Book also contains a number of documents which are dated “as of
REDACTED and which were all prepared
by Ms. Viggers and signed by Mr. Swanick. These include:

Actual dating

181.

The Claimant does not dispute and Mr. Swanick acknowledges that these
corporate documents were prepared and signed at a later date than the official “as
of” date shown. It is thus undisputed that these documents were backdated. But it
is impossible to ascertain the degree of backdating: neither Mr. Swanick nor Ms.

PCA $5798 - NAFTA Gallo v Canada,

Viggers can remember the exact date when these documents were actually
prepared and executed.

182. There is thus no documentary evidence in the record showing when the
documents dated as of June 26, 2002 were actually prepared and signed.

183.

3

The only evidence in the record is in the negative sense: it is impossible that the
June 26, 2002 documents were actually signed before September 9, 2002. The
reason is that Mr. Lindblom, Respondent’s expert, has shown that the signature on
one of the June 26, 2002 documents appears indented on a document which bears
the September 9, 2002 date*', But Mr. Lindblom’ analysis only proves that the
June 26, 2002 were signed at the earliest on September 9, 2002; they do not prove
when they were actually executed, especially bearing i in mind that it is proven that
the September 9, 2002 documents were backdated’. And there is no other
evidence in the file clarifying this issue. The signature could have taken place
within 60 days from September 9, 2002, as Mr. Swanick avers was the practice of
his law firm, or at a later date, before or after enactment of the AMLA. There
simply is no evidence in the file.

Number of writing episodes

184. Another surprising feature of the set of documents signed as of June 26, 2002 is
that Mr. Swanick used five different pens to write his name. This has been
established by ink test performed by the expert Mr. Lindblom®’, who added that
“in many thousands of documents that I’ve looked at, it’s very unusual that such a
small number of documents would be executed with so many pens‘, The
implication is that Mr. Swanick must have signed the set of documents which all
bear the same date in more than one writing episode, spread out over various
days.

185. Mr. Swanick, however, has explained that it was his custom to have a number of
pens on his desk, that he would use them at random, that he was frequently
interrupted during the signature of documents, and that it could well have
occurred that he used five pens in total even if all documents were signed in one
writing episode. And he avers that this is what has happened®®. Ms. Viggers
confirmed Mr. Swanick’s allegations that he had many pens, . that he was
frequently interrupted while signing and that he was extremely busy®*,

186. Although it certainly seems unusual that a small set of documents is signed with
five different pens, the Tribunal cannot exclude that things may have happened as
Mr. Swanick alleges. And since both Mr. Swanick and Ms. Viggers accept that

not Mr. Gallo, the only shareholder, nor Mr. Swanick, the President and only

188. There are a number of rather unusual elements surrounding this General Banking

borders on the unbelievable that an experienced lawyer like Mr. Swanick

have been signed twice by Mr. Swanick, who held both positions.

192. The Respondent has suggested the possibility that there were, at some point, other
directors or officers of the Enterprise that were listed in the Officers’ and

Directors’ Registers of the Minute Book, -jaeyNeuses)
REDACTED

193. In the Respondent’s opinion, this possibility is reinforced by additional evidence.
It is a fact that the original Officers’ and Directors’ Registers, which came with
the Minute Book, were removed, and that a new version was printed by
Ms. Viggers”. Ms. Viggers explained that she did so because the original
Registers were missing from the Minute Book. But this statement is contradicted
by Mr. Bain, the manager of the company manufacturing the Minute Book, who
deposed as a witness, and averred that the possibility that a specific ledger had
been left out from a delivered Minute Book was extremely unlikely and that he
was not aware of that ever having happened”!

194. The issuance of the General Banking Resolution is surrounded by unusual
circumstances. It is strange that Mr. Gallo, the alleged owner, (Ax BlN@ANS13)

   

 

And it is an odd coincidence that the Minute Book delivered to the
Enterprise was incomplete, an incident which the manufacturer asserts had never

195. The third and most relevant date is September 9, 2002, because the Minute Book
records three significant corporate acts allegedly performed on September 9,
2002:

(i) The first is the endorsement of the original share certificate, issued by
Mr. Swanick, in favour of Mr. Gallo; this was done by Mr. Swanick signing on
the back of the certificate; Mr. Gallo did not sign the (acceptance of) the
endorsement; the date is stated as “September 9, 2002”, but it is plainly visible
that the original date had been “September 2, 2002” and that it was corrected by

hand to read “September 9, 2002”; September 2, 2002 had been Labour Day, a
national holiday, and a date when a share transfer was unlikely to have occurred;
the signature was made “in presence” of a witness, whose signature appears on
the endorsement; this witness was Ms. Laura Querin, an assistant in Mr.
Swanick’s law firm”; Claimant has not called Ms. Querin to depose in this
procedure and her presence on September 2, 2002, a holiday, would have been
highly unlikely.

197. (ii) The second is the issuance of a new share certificate, in favour of Mr. Gallo;
again, this document is only signed by Mr. Swanick; there is no signature from
Mr. Gallo or any other person; the date is September 9, 2002.

198. (iii) The third is the registration of the transfer in the Shareholders Register: the
name “Brent W. Swanick in trust” was deleted and the name Vito Gallo inserted;
the date of the transfer is September 9, 2002, but again it is plainly visible that the
original date had been September 2, 2002, and that this was corrected
subsequently to September 9, 2002.

199. These three documents are crucial for proving Claimant’s standing: they are the
only written evidence in the record, purporting to prove that he was the
Enterprise’s owner of record at the time when the AMLA was enacted. And of the
three, the Shareholders Register is the most important document, because under

93,

Ontario law it is determinative of the ownership in the shares of a corporation’.

201. Two questions arise: (i) who drafted these documents, and (ii) when were they
prepared or signed?

(i) | Who drafted the documents?

202. As regards the first question, the evidence shows that the Shareholders Register —
which is not signed — was written by Ms. Viggers of her own hand. This has been

confirmed by Mr. Swanick™ and by Ms. Viggers herself®’. And the two share
certificates were filled in by Ms. Viggers, and signed by Mr. Swanick.

(ii) When were the documents prepared?

Both Mr. Swanick and Ms. Viggers acknowledge that the transfer of the share
capital in favour of Mr. Gallo did not occur on the date stated in the Shareholders
Registry — i.e. September 9, 2002 — but at a later date”, and that the entry in the
Shareholders Registry, the endorsement of the first share certificate and the
issuance of the second certificate, which all bear the date September 9, 2002, in
fact were all prepared and signed on a later date, and then backdated.

What was the actual date of transfer of the share capital in favour of Mr. Gallo?

Neither Mr. Swanick nor Ms. Viggers have a precise recollection, and
consequently they cannot testify as to a precise date’’. The only testimony they
did offer is that the documents must have been signed in accordance with the
routine adopted in the Swanick law firm. It is submitted that this routine implied
that corporate documents were systematically backdated. But there have been
significant divergences regarding the extent of the backdating:

In his witness statement, Mr. Swanick averred that documents were prepared and
signed within 60 days after the date indicated thereon”*; he reiterated the same
position during the hearing”.

. Ms. Viggers declared in her witness statement that it was her practice to organise

the Minute Book after Form 1'®, which informs the Ministry of the identity of the
officers and directors of a newly incorporated company'’', had been sent to the
authorities (which in the case of the Enterprise was done on September 12, 2002);
during the hearing, she changed her position and declared that the Minute Book
was organised “within a month or so after. the initial incorporation" (i.e June
26, 2002), not after the delivery of Form 1'°.

The 2002/3 Resolutions

In fact, the Swanick law firm seems to have lacked clear instructions or accepted
routines regarding the (back) dating of corporate documents.

209. The record shows two corporate resolutions which were backdated by periods of
time which significantly exceed the periods referred to by Mr. Swanick and
Ms. Viggers in their testimonies: these are two “Resolutions of Shareholders”
dated as of March 8, 2003 and of March 9, 2004, signed by Mr. Gallo, approving
the financial statements for 2002 and 2003 [the “2002/3 Resolutions”) and
included in the Enterprise’s Minute Book.

210. The 2002/3 Resolutions are significant for this procedure, because if they had
actually been signed by Mr. Gallo before the promulgation of the AMLA, they
would have represented an important piece of evidence proving that Mr. Gallo
indeed was the contemporaneous shareholder.

211. In his supplementary witness statement, Mr. Swanick categorically affirmed that

the 2002/3 Resolutions had not been backdated and that they had been approved
before the AMLA:

“I deny that these documents [''] were signed after the Adams Mine
Lake Act was enacted. | further deny that they were signed then as
part of a fraudulent conspiracy to transfer the ownership to Mr. Gallo
so that this proceeding could commence™'”>.

At the hearing, Mr. Swanick had to acknowledge that this statement was false!”
In fact, the 2002/3 Resolutions had been signed by Mr. Gallo in 2008, and then
backdated to 2003 and 2004.

The Swanick practice of backdating

212. The Tribunal finds that the Swanick firm incurred in a systematic practice of
d corporate d lutions and other decisions were dated not
as of the date oF actual preparation or signature, but as of the date when a related
transaction had been carried out, or when the corporate resolution should have
been adopted. The practice of backdating involves a risk: the actual date of a
corporate resolution or of the registration in the share register of a share transfer
also produces effects vis-a-vis third parties. In our case, whether the share transfer
occurred before or after promulgation of the AMLA has deep implications for the
legal standing of the Claimant. In these cases, what must count is, of course, the
actual date of the transfer, not the formal date ex post inserted into the corporate
records by the company secretary.

The actual date of the transfer

213. This leads to the problem of establishing the actual date when Mr. Gallo became
the owner of the Enterprise. There is no doubt that Mr. Gallo now is the

shareholder of record of the Enterprise. But this is not the issue relevant for
establishing his standing in this arbitration. The relevant question is when he
achieved ownership.

The official date of acquisition stated in the Shareholders Register was Sep

2, 2002, a date which was then corrected by hand to read September 9, 2002. But
it is undisputed that none of these is the real date, and that the Register was
backdated. Can the actual date of acquisition be established?

In fact, there is no evidence in the file proving the date when Mr. Gallo actually
became the owner of the Enterprise.

First of all, there is a total absence of written circumstantial evidence. The record
lacks any document of any type proving that Mr. Gallo became the shareholder of
the Enterprise before the enactment of the AMLA; there is not even a reference to
Mr. Gallo in any contemporaneous document of any kind.

The only available evidence regarding the actual date are the testimonies of
Mr. Swanick and Ms. Viggers.

Mr. Swanick cannot remember the date of his signature. His only recollection is
that, on the date when the AMLA was approved, he went to the corporate records
of the Enterprise, and they were complete'”’. But Mr. Swanick is not an unbiased
and uninterested witness. He was — and still is — 4S TED

ee anc he has not been the most consistent of witnesses.

     

Furthermore, it is not true that on the date of enactment of the AMLA the
corporate records of the Enterprise were complete. The Minute Book should have
included the 2002/3 Resolutions, approving the financial statements for 2002 and
2003, duly signed by Mr. Gallo. It is now undisputed that, on the date of the
AMLA, these Resolutions were not there, and Mr. Swanick has now
acknowledged that they were signed in 2008 and backdated.

Ms. Viggers also does not remember the exact date when she filled in the
Shareholders Registry, but she has deposed that her practice was to do it within a
short period of time since incorporation. Ms. Viggers was also adamant that in her
17 years in the Swanick law firm she had never been asked to manipulate a
minute book in any way'”*

The Tribunal has no reason to doubt Ms. Viggers’ straightforwardness. It will
thus accept that no one asked her to handle minute books in such a way that she
would see a palpable manipulation. But Ms. Viggers admitted that she frequently
took instructions from lawyers in the office to prepare documents to reflect past
events and to date such documents not as of the date of preparation, but as of the

date she was told the event had happened’. It should be remembered that in our
case September 9, 2002 — the official date of the share transfer — coincides with
the closing date for the sale of the Adams Mine (see next paragraph). Moreover,
Ms. Viggers testified that she was not aware of the enactment of the AMLA'",
and thus an instruction to record the Claimant’s ownership as of an earlier date,
even if such instruction was given after the AMLA, would not have raised her
attention and Seemed unusual. Therefore her practice of backdating but not

Claimant’s name in the Shareholders Register after the AMLA!!!.

4. THE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AND RELATED AGREE Ss

   

Pro memoria: on May 10, 2002 Mr. Cortellucci had signed the Purchase
Agreement, undertaking to buy the Adams Mine against payments totaling
approximately C$ 3.25 million. The closing of the transaction and actual transfer
of the mine were postponed until the acquisition vehicle had been incorporated
and the requisite financing obtained. This was accomplished in the first days of
September 2002.

On September 9, 2002 Notre conveyed the Adams Mine to the Enterprise — the
vehicle which had been created by Mr. Swanick on June 26. The conveyance was
documented” in a standard form (“Transfer/Deed of Land”), with Notre as the
transferor, the Enterprise as the transferee and a purchase price of C$ 1.8 million.

. On the following day Mr. Swanick formed a Limited Partnership (Spy Nets)

One of the unusual aspects of the facts as presented by the Claimant is that
Mr. Gallo, the alleged owner of the Enterprise and of the Mine, not only failed to
visit the Mine at any time, but he did not even once meet with or speak over the
telephone with Mr. McGuinty, its managing director’, The lack of knowledge
was reciprocal: the existence of Mr. Gallo was never disclosed to Mr. McGuinty,
who only met with and reported to Mr. Cortellucci, and who believed throughout
this period that the Cortellucci Group was the actual owner of the Adams Mine'™

Mr. Gallo’s lack of participation is total. He left everything in the hands of
Mr. Cortellucci, never asked for information and never gave any instructions.
There is no documentary evidence — not an email, not a letter, not a fax, not a
memorandum, not a note, absolutely no document — showing that the Claimant
was in any way involved in any of the business operations of the Enterprise, that
he gave any instructions or that he was informed of what was being done or what
had been accomplished'”’.

This situation is the more astonishing, because in the two years between the
purchase of the property and the promulgation of the AMLA a number of
significant events affecting the Adams Mine happened: the Enterprise attempted
to obtain permits which were outstanding, to purchase the border lands
surrounding the site, it was involved in two serious litigations and there were
several efforts to resell the Adams Mine.

Mr. Gallo’s lack of interest stands in stark contrast with the activity shown by
Mr. Cortellucci. It was Mr. Cortellucci who engaged Mr. McGuinty, and to whom
Mr. McGuinty reported'™ 6 it was Mr. Cortellucci who twice visited the site'”

was the true and only owner of the Enterprise, and Mr. Cortellucci was simply his
agent, Mr. Gallo’s ownership of the Enterprise must have had some impact on his
own and on the Enterprise’s tax declarations.

Mr. Gallo’s personal income tax returns

US tax residents are required by US tax law to file an annual income tax
declaration to the IRS, together with accompanying forms and schedules. The law
requires that, if the US resident is the sole shareholder of a foreign corporation, he
make a separate declaration using Form 5471.

REDACTED

 
 
 

After some procrastination, Mr. Gallo finally acknowledged that he had failed to
submit Form 547] jointly with his annual statements, and that in November 2008
he filed with the IRS Forms 5471 for all the relevant years; i.e. the IRS was not
informed that Mr. Gallo was the owner of the Enterprise until after the
commencement of this arbitration and one month after Mr. Gallo had received
Canada’s request for documents.

Failure to present Form 547] when due can result in substantial fines’,

Tax filing by the Enterprise

The Claimant initially relied on the Enterprise’s 2002 and 2003 Canadian tax
returns to prove that he owned the Enterprise prior to the introduction of the
AMLA™®, Later on the Claimant acknowledged that these returns had been filed
in October 2004, i.e. after the enactment of the AMLA. Moreover, the returns,
although they indicated that Mr. Gallo was the only shareholder, described the
Enterprise as a “Canadian Controlled Private Corporation” (“CCPC”) — a
statement which is not compatible with Mr. Gallo’s alleged ownership.

7. MR. GALLO’S THE US

 

Mr. Gallo submits that, after the acquisition of the Adams Mine, he contacted
several individuals in the US waste industry to sound out if they would be
prepared to participate as partners in the venture. For these purposes, he used
Mr. Jeffrey Belardi, a lawyer from Pennsylvania specialised in the waste
management sector and his personal friend, and Mr. Philip Noto, a retired
Lieutenant Colonel now working as a consultant and also personal friend of
Mr. Gallo. There is no record that the Claimant either contacted other US
individuals or performed additional activities p ing the i in the
Adams Mine".

Mr. Belardi’s main client was PEE owner of significant landfills
in the US, At some point in 2002 Mr. Gallo submits that he told Mr. Belardi that
he had purchased a waste disposal site in Toronto, and they discussed the general
characteristics of the site. Thereafter, Mr. Belardi approached and
asked him in general terms whether he would be interested in investing in a waste
disposal project in Ontario. Mr. Belardi did not mention to SRNGRISON tine
name or location of the site he was referring to'**, Mr. Belardi has testified that
EER 2s, excited about the possibility of investing in the project and
“ready to go”"°. Ev met Mr. Gallo, no written documents of any
kind were exchanged, and no formal bid or offer was ever made.

Mr. Philip Noto and Mr. Gallo allegedly discussed the possibility of investing in a
waste disposal project in Canada at the beginning of 2002 — at a time when both
Mr. Gallo and Mr. Noto were still “at-will” employees of the Pennsylvania
Government. Mr. Noto had contacts in the waste disposal industry, promised to
help and approached {=eyXeqgsp) a well-known entrepreneur in the
sector'*’. As in all other previous occasions, there is no document trail confirming
these contacts: Mr. Gallo never provided Mr. Noto with a single document!**, and
he also did not provide him with any details about the size or permitted capacity
of the Adams Mine'*’, not even with the name of the site'“’. The potential
investor could only have a very vague, general idea of the venture he was
allegedly invited to participate in.

 

Summing up, the Tribunal concludes that Mr. Gallo did contact two of his friends
in the US and these friends have deposed that they contacted two US
entrepreneurs with experience in the waste management sector. No documents
were forwarded, no precise details were shared, not even the name of the mine
seems to have been conveyed to the prospective investors. The purpose of the
contacts seems to have been limited to asking if, assuming that a good investment
opportunity in a waste disposal site in Ontario appeared, the US investors would
be prepared to participate. To which the US entrepreneurs gave the obvious
answer: if the project is promising, they would be ready to commit funds.

 

After the acquisition of the Adams Mine by the Enterprise, and before the
enactment of the AMLA, Mr. Cortellucci — allegedly acting as Mr. Gallo’s agent
— tried on several occasions to resell the Mine with a substantial profit. For

The possibility of reselling the Mine to the Toronto authorities at a huge profit
was no chimera: it should be remembered that Mr. Cortellucci was a very well
connected millionaire, had extensive experience in property dealings, was one of
the biggest donors to the party then in power in the provincial government! and
there was an acute need to solve the waste disposal problem in Ontario.

Sharing of profits between Mr. Gallo and Mr. Cortellucci

256. An important question to be addressed is how profits generated by the resale
would have been shared between Mr. Gallo and Mr. Cortellucci (and the other
limited partners). Would the capital gain accrue to Mr. Cortellucci and his
investors, or would it flow to Mr. Gallo? The Tribunal posed this very question to
the Claimant in the Tribunal’s communication A 30, and in due course the
Claimant gave the following answer

Enterprise and the Partnership. Mr. Cortellucci was the principal partner in the
Partnership, and that may have justified that he signed on the Partnership’s
behalf'**. But how could he sign on behalf of the Enterprise?

264. Mr. Cortellucci testified that he believed that he had the authority to do so'”’. But

in fact he did not. The only authorised signing officer of the Enterprise was

Mr. Swanick. And Mr. Swanick testified that he was never informed of the

This arrangement is totally in contradiction with the allegations made by the

There is an additional inconsistency: Mr. Gallo was not even made aware of the

telephone, that he was retaining {qp¥Neawaip) for the sale of the Adams Mine'™.

But he never showed Mr. Gallo the [SIINCMA greement, and never explained to
Mr. Gallo the essential details of the transaction. Mr. Gallo never got to know that
the purchase price would flow to the Partnership, and not to his own company,
and that Mr. Cortellucci, allegedly acting as his agent, in fact was giving away his
ownership rights'**,

9. | ENACTMENT OF THE AMLA

On 2 October 2003 a new liberal government was elected in Ontario and
Mr. David Ramsay, MPP, was the newly appointed Minister of Natural
Resources. Mr. Ramsay was a virulent opponent of the Adams Mine waste
disposal site, and the local MPP for the area for more than a decade!**. He was so
opposed to the development of the Adams Mine as a waste disposal site, that he
threatened to resign as a Minister, if the plans were not stopped'*’. Thus the new
Liberal government was under significant political pressure from Mr. Ramsay to
shut the project down and take away the Certificate of Approval which had
already been issued to the site.

On July 7, 2003 the Enterprise had filed an application to obtain the Permit to
Take Water, an important step for the actual commencement of the works, and it

was expected that the authorisation would actually be issued by early April
2004'%*, This made immediate legislative action unavoidable, if the project was to
be successfully stopped. On April 5, 2004 the AMLA was introduced into the
Ontario legislature and it was duly enacted on June 17, 2004. Before enactment,
the bill was refered to the Standing Committee of the Legislative Assembly, an

d di comprised of of all parties. The
Enterprise was provided with an opportunity to make a presentation to the
Standing Committee, and Mr. McGuinty appeared on its behalf!**. He made a
well drafted and well argued presentation, criticised the Proposed legislation, and
asked for an ding the of
Mr. McGuinty at no moment mentioned that the Enterprise was owned by an
American investor, protected by the NAFTA.

 

The purpose of the AMLA was a total prohibition for the Adams Mine to be used
as a waste disposal site'°. To achieve this aim, all environmental approvals which
had been obtained by Notre and the Enterprise (both companies being mentioned
nominatim) were revoked imperio legis'®'. Additionally, all agreements already
signed between Notre and the Crown in right of Ontario, for the purchase of
certain land adjacent to the Mine (the so called “Borderlands”) were also declared
extinguished imperio legis'”.

The AMLA specifically stated that these actions do not “constitute an
expropriation or injurious affection”'®. Notwithstanding the above, the AMLA
acknowledged that Notre and the Enterprise were entitled to some limited
compensation, to be established in accordance with a formula. In essence, the
compensation was limited to the amount of reasonable expenses incurred by
Notre and the Enterprise, minus the fair market value of the Adams Mine site, on
the day when the AMLA came into force’, The law added that “for greater
certainty, no compensation is payable ... for any loss of goodwill or possible
profits’"°*. The AMLA allowed the Enterprise to apply toa domestic court but
only to determine any issue of “fact or law” concerning compensation!

Finally, the law also included a section, purporting to extinguish all causes of
action against the Crown, the Executive Council or its employees, that existed at
the time of enactment of the AMLA, or which had arisen between 1989 and the
enactment!

An issue (going to the evidence in the record) for this Tribunal to consider is
whether, at some time before the enactment of the AMLA, the fact that the
Enterprise was owned by a US investor, protected by the NAFTA, was ever
disclosed to the Ontario authorities. It would possibly bring some credibility that,
before the enactment of AMLA, Mr. Gallo had some part in the Enterprise. There
is no evidence of this having happened. The Respondent has averred that the
Government of Ontario was not aware that there was a US investor'” and the
Claimant has also implicitly accepted that he never told the authorities about his

VII. AssESSMENT OF EVIDENCE

 

1. INTRODUCTION: THE BURDEN OF PROOF

 

277. Both parties submit, and the Tribunal concurs, that the maxim “who asserts must
prove”, or actori incumbit probatio, applies also in the jurisdictional phase of this
investment arbitration’: a claimant bears the burden of proving that he has
standing and the tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the claims submitted. If
jurisdiction rests on the existence of certain facts, these must be proven at the
jurisdictional stage — only the alleged violations of the treaty affording
jurisdiction (in this case the NAFTA) can be accepted pro tem'”, But the
principle actori incumbit probatio is a coin with two sides: the Claimant has to
prove its case, and without evidence it will fail; but if the Respondent raises
defences, of fraud or otherwise, the burden shifts, and the defences can only
succeed if supported by evidence marshalled by the Respondent.

278. The Claimant has added a twist: in his opinion, if the Respondent raises defences
of fraud and abuse of process, it lies with the Respondent to provide compelling,
affirmative evidence, which fully supports its allegations!” In the Claimant’s
opinion, international tribunals should set a high threshold for evidence
supporting the existence of an alleged fraud or acts of bad faith, such as an abuse
of right!” . The Respondent has challenged these conclusions, asserting that the
Claimant is mischaracterising Canada’s position, and that Canada has never
alleged that the Claimant has engaged in a fraudulent conspiracy.

279. In the Tribunal’s opinion, given the Respondent’s acknowledgement that it is not
pleading fraud, the issue raised by the Claimant has become moot and it is not
necessary to address whether the standard for proving fraud should be more
demanding or more relaxed than the usual standard.

 

2. WEIGHING OF EVIDENCE REGARDING THE TUAL RECORD

 

280. The first task which the Tribunal has to face is that of weighing the evidence
regarding the factual record. Mr. Gallo has presented extensive pleadings
explaining how the facts developed, and has submitted evidence in an effort to
prove his case, The Respondent has devoted important efforts, trying to destroy
the plausibility of the factual record as presented by Mr. Gallo. Thus the Tribunal
has to establish to what extent the facts actually happened as Mr. Gallo is now
averring they did.

It is evident to the Tribunal that the acquisition, financing and management of the
Adams Mine was not structured nor documented in the way one would expect
experienced business people to act when making a significant M&A (merger &
acquisition) transaction. The factual record is full of unusual circumstances and
outright mistakes:

It is unusual that Mr. Gallo, although he incorporated a corporation and
allegedly purchased the Adams Mine for more than C$ 3 million, never
signed any document whatsoever; there is not one single document in the
file, dated pre AMLA, which bears Mr. Gallo’s signature;

It is even more unusual that Mr. Gallo’s name does not even appear in any
unchallenged contemporaneous document;

It is also unusual that Mr. Gallo and Mr. Cortellucci, who only met once at a
social event, later on agreed, over the telephone, on the Cortellucci-Gallo
Agreement; this Agreement was never formalised in writing, everything
being agreed orally over the telephone, without a single scrap of paper
documenting their dealings; this contrasts with Mr. Cortellucci’s practice in
other circumstances, where contractual arrangements were properly
formalised;
It is surprising that the Purchase Agreement was (iSpyXeutSp)

   

 

Mr. Gallo’s lack of curiosity and interest is also surprising: he never went to

memorandum; he entrusted the management of the mine to Mr. Cortellucci,
and never gave any written instructions;

It is unusual that Mr. Swanick, an experienced lawyer, SBI NCAESP)

 

More unusual yet is that Mr. Swanick accepted to act as the only

It is also highly unusual that Mr. Cortellucci, who publicly acted as the
owner of the mine with respect to third parties, was not the actual owner of
the mine, while the true owner, Mr. Gallo, was kept absolutely secret from
everyone, including the general manager of the Adams Mine and the
Government of Ontario;

It is unusual that Mr. Swanick ed the small set of corporate documents
relating to the Enterprise dated REDACTED BRN five different pens and in

ready to accept that the Claimant has not participated in any fraudulent conspiracy

are neither false nor fraudulent. The Tribunal thus accepts that the Enterprise and

A. The date of acquisition of the Enterprise

4. In accordance with the principle actori incumbit probatio, it is for the Claimant to
marshal convincing evidence showing the date when he acquired ownership of the
Enterprise’s share capital, in accordance with applicable law, in this case Ontario
corporate law,

a

Ontario law provides that a corporation is required to maintain a securities
register at its registered office, or elsewhere in Ontario at a place designated by
the Board of Directors'”’. The corporation is entitled to treat the person named in
the register “as the person exclusively entitled to vote, to receive notices, to
receive any interest, dividend or other payments in respect of the security, and
otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of a holder of the security”!®’.
The registration in the securities register maintained by the corporation is
consequently the relevant factor for establishing ownership.

6. The Shareholders’ Register of the Enterprise states that on September 9, 2002
Mr. Gallo became the owner of the Enterprise’s only share and the person
controlling the corporation. Prima facie it would thus seem that Mr. Gallo has
proven that as of that date he became the owner and controller of the Enterprise.

7. But this prima facie evidence only creates a rebuttable presumption, which must
give way if undisputable proof is marshalled, showing that the transaction took
place at a date different from that stated in the Shareholders’ Registry'*!. And this
undisputable proof has been provided: the Enterprise’s secretary, Mr. Swanick,
the person legally responsible for keeping the Enterprise’s records, and his
assistant, Ms. Viggers, the person who actually filled in the Shareholders’
Registry, have both deposed under oath that the transfer of the share in favour of
Mr. Gallo did not happen on the date stated in the Registry, but at a later date'™.
In view of this acknowledgement, the Tribunal concludes that Mr. Gallo did not
acquire the share capital of the Enterprise on September 9, 2002, the date shown
in the Shareholders’ Registry.

oo

If the acquisition did not take place on that date, when did it happen? Before or
after the enactment of the AMLA? Neither Mr. Swanick nor Ms. Viggers were
able to testify as to the precise date when the transfer was actually registered in
the Shareholders’ Registry'*’. Ms. Viggers did not remember the enactment of the
AMLA, so that her testimony cannot prove whether the acquisition occurred pre
or post AMLA'. The only evidence purporting to prove that the transfer was

performed before the AMLA is the testimony of Mr. Swanick that on the date of
introduction of the Act, he went to the file and he found that the Minute Book was
complete!®’.

But this testimony does not carry sufficient evidentiary conviction, neither from a
subjective nor from an objective point of view. Subjectively, the deposition is not
made by an independent and unbiased witness, but by the Claimant’s lawyer, who
also was the Enterprise’s secretary, and who has a personal interest in the
matter'®’, Objectively, the Tribunal would expect Mr. Swanick’s testimony to be
corroborated by some circumstantial evidence. There is none. In an age where
almost every human action leaves a written record, it is simply unconceivable that
the Claimant, after extensive discovery, has not been able to produce one single
shred of documentary evidence, confirming the date when Mr. Gallo acquired
ownership: no agreement, no contract, no confirmation slip, no instruction letter,
no memorandum, no invoice, no email, no file note, no tax declaration, no
submission to any authority — absolutely nothing. In addition, as noted in
paragraph 219 supra, it is not true that on the date of enactment of the AMLA the
corporate records of the Enterprise were complete. It is now undisputed that, on
the date of enactment of the AMLA, the Minute Book did not include the 2002/3
Resolutions approving the financial statements for 2002 and 2003, which
Mr. Swanick has acknowledged were signed in 2008 and backdated.

The Tribunal’s conclusion

The Tribunal, after carefully reviewing the extensive evidence marshalled by the
parties, has reached the conclusion that the Claimant has not proven the date on
which Mr. Gallo acquired ownership and control of the Enterprise. And from the
evidentiary record submitted in this case it is not possible to ascertain whether this
happened before or after the enactment of the AMLA.

There are two additional elements of persuasion which weigh heavily in the
Tribunal’s determination: the inexistence of contemporaneous corporate
resolutions and the absence of contemporaneous tax filings.

Inexistence of contemporaneous corporate resolutions

In the time period between the purported acquisition of the Enterprise by
Mr. Gallo and the enactment of the AMLA (i.e. between September 9, 2002 and
April 5. 200), the Enterprise should have approved the so-called 2002/3

I the Share PP! g the 2002 and 2003
financial statements”, And these Resolutions should have been signed by the
Enterprise’s only shareholder, Mr. Gallo. In fact, the 2002/3 Resolutions were
approved in 2008, when this arbitration procedure had already been filed, and

then backdated, purporting to have been signed on March 8, 2003 and
March 9, 2004.

It is a basic duty of every corporation to have its annual financial statements
approved in a general shareholders meeting'**, to be held at the beginning of the
next fiscal year'®, and every minimally diligent corporate secretary is aware that
the appropriate resolutions must be approved by the shareholders'*”. Mr. Swanick,
an experienced lawyer with an extensive corporate and tax practice, must have
been aware of this legal obligation. If Mr. Gallo indeed was the only shareholder
of the Enterprise, he should have signed the 2002/3 Resolutions
contemporaneously — and not with a delay of more than four years.

Absence of contemporaneous tax filings

The absence of personal and corporate tax returns filed in the period between the
acquisition of the Adams Mine and the enactment of the AMLA further weakens
the plausibility of the Claimant’s allegations. Both Mr. Gallo and the Enterprise
should have presented tax declarations for the fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to the
US and to the Canadian tax authorities, Mr. Gallo disclosing that he was the
owner of the Enterprise and the Adams Mine, and the Enterprise identifying
Mr. Gallo as its only shareholder. Both Mr. Gallo and the Enterprise were under a
legal obligation to do so, and both failed to comply. After the enactment of the
AMLA, the Claimant submits that he became aware of his failure and belatedly
did what the law required him to do.

Mr. Gallo has tried to explain why he failed to comply with the requirements of
US tax law, (ESD) NOT =p

It may be that Mr. Gallo was unaware of his US taxpayer reporting obligations.
However, it seems implausible that Mr. Gallo, a trained lawyer, who should have
been aware of US tax law and of the penalties for non-compliance, and a civil
servant with a political appointment, who should have been worried about the
reputational risk, never gave thought to possible tax implications of being the
owner of the Adams Mine in Canada — a waste disposal site which he had just
purchased for a price of at least C$ 3.25 million and which potentially could
develop into a business worth tens of millions of Dollars. His conduct is thus not

consistent with what he would have been expected to do given his involvement in
what could have become a considerable investment.

eee

In summary, the burden of proving that at the relevant time he was the only
shareholder of the Enterprise rests with the Claimant. The Tribunal finds that the
Claimant has proven that he is the owner of record of the only share issued by the
Enterprise and, thus, formally the sole owner of the corporation and the person
who controls it. But he has not been able to discharge his duty of proving the date
when he acquired ownership and control. There cannot be any dispute that the
purported date stated in the Shareholders’ Registry — September 9, 2002 — is not
the date when the registration was performed and the transfer of the shares took
place. The burden of proving the actual date of transfer, and proving that this date
predates the AMLA, falls on the Claimant. He has not succeeded.

B. The nature of the relationship between Mr. Gallo and Mr. Cortellucci

Both Mr. Gallo and Mr. Cortellucci have accepted that, at the time of the
acquisition of the Adams Mine, they entered into the oral Cortellucci-Gallo
Agreement, in which Mr. Gallo allegedly acted as principal, and Mr. Cortellucci
as agent!

The record confirms that a contractual relationship indeed arose between
Mr. Gallo and Mr. Cortellucci, and that this relationship seems to fit the pattern of
a fiduciary relationship.

But the Tribunal rejects that this fiduciary relationship was structured in the way
the Claimant and Mr. Cortellucci now aver. Except for their own depositions,
there is no evidence that Mr. Cortellucci, a wealthy, experienced business man,
who was providing all the funding required by the Enterprise, who was taking

i without or who was publicly
appearing as the owner of the Adams Mine, in fact was the agent of a young
American civil servant, whom he had only met once at a social function, and with
whom he only spoke on the telephone.

 

The basic theory of the agency device is to enable a person, through the services
of another, to broaden the scope of activities and receive the product of another's
efforts, possibly paying such other for what he does, but retaining for himself the
risk of and the benefit from the work performed by the agent. In an agency
relationship, it is the principal who takes the decisions and the agent who follows
the principal’s instructions, it is the principal who assumes the risk and the
reward, and it is normally the principal who provides the funding.

was superseded by the oral Cortellucci-Gallo Agreement.

- Had found the investment opportunity;

- Had provided all

- Was performing all of the management tasks;

- Was taking the reputational risk surrounding the development of the site;

- And had all the political and personal connections necessary for a
successful completion of the sale.

 

306. What was Mr. Gallo’s contribution to the deal?

307. Mr. Gallo had, during a family ceremony, whispered into Mr. Cortellucci’s ear
that investing in the waste management sector was a good idea — a thought which
Mr. Cortellucci could easily have developed on his own. Further to that, the
record does not show that Mr. Gallo made any additional contribution (no money,
no personal activity, no contacts, no third party funds). Mr. Gallo even denied
authorisation for his name to be made public, so that Mr. Cortellucci had to face
all the bad publicity caused by the plans to transform a mine into a hazardous
waste management facility, But in fact — if we are to accept Mr. Gallo’s and
Mr. Cortellucci’s story — the true owner of the Adams Mine was not the person
being publicly blamed, but rather a young US civil servant, who for reasons of his
own did not want his name to become known.

308. In view of the contributions made by each of the parties, the
distribution of profits between Mr. Gallo and Mr. Cortellucci borders on the
unbelievable: it is hard to believe that Mr. Cortellucci, a seasoned and very
experienced business man, accepted a business deal so skewed in favour of the

counterparty. And this alleged distribution stands in stark contradiction with the

The Agreement, which foresaw that the Adams Mine would be resold
with a huge profit (the amounts to be received would have exceeded C$ 170

the real terms of the deal: while the written agreements provided for

of the profits, the oral Cortellucci-Gallo Agreement between Mr. Gallo and
Mr. Cortellucci must have established that in case of sale of the Adams Mine the
totality (or at least a very substantial part of the profits) would flow to
Mr. Cortellucci and partners and not to Mr. Gallo.

. This conclusion confirms the Tribunal’s opinion that the rights and obligations

assumed by Mr. Gallo in the Cortellucci-Gallo Agreement, cannot be
characterised as those of a principal, nor those assumed by Mr. Cortellucci as
those of an agent; in fact, it was Mr. Cortellucci who gave instructions, who
provided funds, who assumed the risk and reward of the business.

4%

Summing up the Tribunal concludes that there are two aspects in the Claimant’s
factual allegations which must be qualified:

- First, the Claimant has not been able to discharge his duty of proving the
date when he acquired ownership of the Enterprise and that this acquisition
predates the AMLA, and

- Second, the oral Cortellucci-Gallo Agreement does not fit the pattern of an
agency agreement, in which Mr. Gallo is the principal and Mr. Cortellucci
is acting as his agent.

VIII. LEGAL ANALYSIS

1. INTRODUCTION

 

313.

o

The Tribunal must decide whether it has jurisdiction to hear the claim brought
pursuant to Art. 1117 of the NAFTA by the Claimant, Mr. Gallo, on behalf of the
Enterprise, against the Respondent, Canada.

NAFTA provisions

314. At the outset it is important to list the provisions of the NAFTA which bear most
relevance upon the issue under adjudication:

315. Article 1101.1 of the NAFTA defines the “Scope and Coverage” of Chapter 11:

“This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party
relating to:

(a) Investors of another Party;

(b) Investments of investors of another party in the territory of the
Party;

(c)...”

316.

a

Article 1117.1 of the NAFTA is the cornerstone of Claimant’s allegation:

“An investor of a Party, on behalf of an enterprise of another Party
that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or
indirectly, may submit... a claim that the other Party has breached an
obligation [defined in Section A of Chapter 11 of the NAFTA] ... and
that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising
out of, that breach”.

317. Equally relevant are various definitions contained in Arts. 201 and 1139 of the
NAFTA:

318.

oo

(i) “Investment”: Art. 1139 defines “investment”, including (among other assets)

- An “enterprise”,

- An “equity security of an enterprise”,

- An “interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in income or
profits of the enterprise”, or

-  “[R]eal estate ... acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of
economic benefit or other business purposes”.

“Enterprise” means “any entity constituted or organized under applicable law,
whether or not for profit, and whether privately owned or governmentally owned,

including any corporation, trust, partnership, sole proprietorship, joint venture or
other association”. And “Enterprise of a Party” is “an enterprise constituted or
organized under the law of a Party, and a branch located in the territory of a Party
and carrying out business activities there”.

(ii) “Investor of a Party” means, in accordance with the same provision, “a
national or an enterprise of such Party, that seeks to make, is making or has made
an investment”.

(iii) “Investment of an investor of a Party” is defined by Art. 1139 to mean “an
investment owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor of such
Party”.

2. LACK OF JURISDICTION RATIONE TEMPORIS
The Tribunal has already found'®> that the Claimant has not been able to
discharge his duty of proving the date when he acquired ownership and control of
the Enterprise, and that this acquisition predates the AMLA. Does this finding
imply that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis?

The Claimant's allegations

The Claimant has submitted that, even if the Tribunal found that Mr. Gallo had
acquired the share of the Enterprise after the promulgation of the law, the
Tribunal would still be vested with authority to decide this case. In Claimant’s
opinion, Art. 1117 of the NAFTA permits an investor of a party to bring a claim
on behalf of an investment enterprise that it owns or controls, directly or
indirectly, without any limitation as to when such ownership or control of the
enterprise began'®*, If there were bona fide commercial reasons for obtaining
control or ownership of an enterprise that just so happened to be nursing a nascent
NAFTA claim, there is nothing in Art. 1117 that would prevent a claim from
being made by the new shareholder on the enterprise’s behalf*?’.

The Respondent’s position

The Respondent disagrees. In Canada’s opinion, for Chapter 11 to apply to a
measure relating to an investment, that investment must be of an investor of
another Party, at the time the measure is adopted or maintained'*. The
Respondent adds that investment arbitration tribunals have also generally found
that they do not have jurisdiction unless a claimant can establish that an
investment was owned by an investor of another party.

Page 64 of 73

The Tribunal’s decision
The Tribunal without hesitation sides with the Respondent.

Art. 1117 of the NAFTA authorises “[a]n investor of a Party, on behalf of an
enterprise of another Party, that is a juridical person that the investor owns or
controls directly or indirectly” to submit a dispute to arbitration. And Art. 1101(1)
limits the scope of Chapter 11 protection “to measures adopted or maintained” by
Canada that relate to “investors of another Party” and “investments of investors of
another Party”. Accordingly, for Chapter 11 of the NAFTA to apply to a measure
relating to an investment, that investment must be owned or controlled by an
investor of another party, and ownership or control must exist at the time the
measure which allegedly violates the Treaty is adopted or maintained. In a claim
under Art. 1117 the investor must prove that he owned or controlled directly or
indirectly the “juridical person” holding the investment, at the critical time.

As the Tribunal in Phoenix declared, it does not need extended explanation to
assert that a tribunal has no jurisdiction ratione temporis to consider claims
arising prior to the date of the alleged investment, because the treaty cannot be
applied to acts committed by a State before the claimant invested in the host
country’. In the present case, the Claimant must have owned or controlled the
Enterprise at the time when the AMLA was enacted. And since the Tribunal has
already found that the Claimant has failed to marshal the evidence necessary to
prove such ownership and control at the relevant time, the necessary consequence
is that his claim must fail for lack of jurisdiction ratione temporis.

The Claimant has submitted a second line of argument: Art. 1117 permits an
investor of a party to bring a claim on behalf of an investment enterprise that it
owns or controls, directly or indirectly, without any limitation as to when such
ownership or control of the enterprise began”. If there were bona fide
commercial reasons for obtaining ownership or control of an enterprise that just
so happened to be nursing a nascent NAFTA claim, there is nothing in Art. 1117
that would prevent a claim from being made on the enterprise’s behalf — so long
as ownership or control was transferred to a person who qualified as an “investor
of a NAFTA party””', This argument is circular: if the obtaining of control or
ownership is made after the alleged breach of the Treaty, the acquired enterprise
cannot be “nursing a nascent NAFTA claim”; there cannot be any enterprise
nursing such a nascent claim, if the enterprise is not already at the time of
acquisition under the control or in the ownership of a NAFTA-protected person, a
circumstance which patently did not arise in this arbitration.

Case law

Investment arbitration tribunals have unanimously found that they do not have
jurisdiction unless the claimant can establish that the investment was owned or
controlled by the investor at the time when the challenged measure was adopted.
Amto”” is a case under the Energy Charter Treaty [*ECT”] which shows
similarities with the present arbitration. The State argued that the investor’s
contractual right to purchase shares did not qualify as an investment under the
ECT, and that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal should commence only as of the
date that Amto could show ownership of the shares. In fact, the tribunal put the
date of the investment at the time on which the records of the corporation in
which a 16% investment had been made. showed Amto’s actual ownership of
16% of the shares in the investment; it was on that date that the tribunal decided
that the jurisdiction ratione temporis began”. All other known investment
arbitration decisions have followed the same line of reasoning’.

The Claimant has not been able to provide a single reference to an arbitral award
supporting his position.

IX. CONCLUSION

 

Investment treaties confer rights to foreign investors, which are unavailable to
nationals of the host country. Legitimate policy reasons justify this differential
treatment. But the same policy reasons mandate that the boundaries between
foreign and domestic investors be respected, and that the privileged rights
conferred to the former are not abused by the latter, in violation of the stated
objectives of the international treaty.

This general principle is reflected in Art. 1117 of the NAFTA, which requires that
any claimant seeking to successfully file an arbitration on behalf of a domestic
“juridical person”, must pass a first hurdle: the plaintiff must prove that at the
time when the alleged treaty violations occurred he or she owned or controlled the
“juridical person” holding the investment.

The case at hand is an excellent example of the tension between claimants’
requests to expand treaty protection to substantially-domestic investment
structures, and the Tribunal’s obligation to apply the treaty on the terms and with
the subjective scope agreed between the NAFTA contracting parties.

The Claimant was asserting that the AMLA, a law enacted by the Legislature of
Ontario, violates certain obligations assumed by Canada under the NAFTA. The
AMLA prohibits the Adams Mine, which is owned by the Enterprise, from being
used as a waste disposal site”, revokes all existing environmental approvals
which had been obtained by Notre and the Enterprise” and annuls all agreements
already signed between Notre and Ontario, for the purchase of certain land
adjacent to the Mine”. The AMLA specifically states that these actions do not
“constitute an expropriation or injurious affection’ and limits compensation to
the reasonable expenses incurred by Notre and the Enterprise, minus the fair
market value of the Adams Mine site, on the day when the AMLA came into
force”. The law adds that “for greater certainty, no compensation is payable ...
for any loss of goodwill or possible profits””'’. The AMLA allowed the Enterprise
to apply to a domestic Court, but only to determine any issue of “fact or law”
concerning compensation”"'.

If the Enterprise were owned or controlled by a person who does not qualify as a
protected investor under the NAFTA, such person, if dissatisfied with the AMLA,
would be restricted to the causes of action provided for under Canadian law. The
situation would be different if the Enterprise were owned or controlled, at the

relevant time, by a US or Mexican investor, since in such case it would enjoy an
additional level of protection: the investor would be entitled to the same
instruments open to Canadian citizens, or alternatively the investor could draw
protection from the international law rights conferred by the NAFTA. The
different treatment applied to foreign and domestic investors is a natural
consequence of the Treaty. However, this unequal treatment is not without
justification: justice is not to grant everyone the same, but suwm cuique tribuere.
Foreigners are more exposed than domestic investors to the sovereign risk
attached to the investment and to arbitrary actions of the host State, and may thus,
as a matter of legitimate policy, be granted a wider scope of protection.

But for investors to enjoy this additional right, there must be a quid pro quo:
Given that the stated objective of investment treaties is to stimulate flows of
private capital into the economies of contracting states, the claimant in any
investment arbitration must prove that he or she is a protected foreign investor,
who at the relevant time owns or controls an investment in the host country. And
Mr. Gallo has only partially succeeded: he has shown that he is a US citizen, but
he has failed to marshal convincing evidence that at the time of enactment of the
AMLA he was the owner of the Enterprise. In these circumstances access to the
additional level of protection afforded by the NAFTA cannot be available, and the
Claimant and the Enterprise must resort to the general remedies available to
investors under Canadian law in general and under the AMLA in particular.

The Claimant included in his Statement of Claim the following prayer for
relief":

“As set out above, Claimants seek the following:

(i) Damages of not less than C$ 104,919,250.00 for interference
with the Enterprise’s use and enjoyment of the Adams Mine
Site, to the extent of its approved landfill capacity;

(ii) Costs associated with these proceedings, including all
professional fees and disbursements;

(iii) An award of compound interest a rate to be fixed by the
Tribunal, both on a pre-award, and on a post-award, basis;

(iv) Payment of a sum of compensation equal to any tax
consequences of the award, in order to maintain the award’s
integrity; and

(v) Such further relief as counsel may advise and that the Tribunal
deems appropriate.”

In his Memorial on Jurisdiction and Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant did not
include a specific prayer for relief.

339. The Respondent has sought, throughout its submissions, the same relief"?

“For the foregoing reasons, Canada respectfully requests that the
Tribunal dismiss the Claimant’s claims in their entirety and with
prejudice, order that the Claimant bear the costs of this arbitration
including Canada’s costs for legal representation and assistance, and
grant any further relief it deems just and proper”.

340. The Tribunal notes that the Claimant has only sought a relief as to the merits of
the claim and the Respondent has requested the Tribunal to dismiss such claim,
with prejudice. Both parties have then asked for the awarding of costs.

341.

Since the Tribunal has decided that is has no jurisdiction over the present dispute,
it will make no decision as regards the merits of the claim — be it with or without
prejudice and it will address costs in the following section.

X. Costs

 

342. There is one final request which has to be addressed: the awarding of costs, the
Claimant and the Respondent having requested’ that the Tribunal order the
counterparty to pay all fees and costs incurred in these preliminary proceedings.

343. The Tribunal observes that, with respect to costs, Article 1135(1) of the NAFTA
simply states that the Tribunal “may also award costs in accordance with the
applicable arbitration rules”. The provisions regarding the Tribunal’s decision in
the matter of costs are therefore to be found in Articles 38 to 40 of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Article 38 defines the “costs of arbitration” as
follows:

“(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each
arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with
article 39;

(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the
arbitral tribunal,

(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such
expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful
party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and
only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount
of such costs is reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the
expenses of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of
Arbitration at The Hague”.

344. Meanwhile, paragraphs | and 2 of Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provide
the criteria to be applied by the Tribunal in awarding costs:

“1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in
principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral
tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it
determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the
circumstances of the case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance
referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into
account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine
which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between
the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable”.

The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules contain two separate rules on the awarding of
costs: (1.) one rule concerning the costs of arbitration, and (2.) another rule for the
costs of the parties’ legal representation and assistance.

1, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION
Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Avbitration Rules stipulates as follows:

“Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in
principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral
tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it
determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the
circumstances of the case”.

Thus, the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provide that, if there is a winning party,
it should “in principle” be exonerated from paying the costs of arbitration. This
principle should only be broken if the Tribunal determines that apportionment as
between the parties is “reasonable.”

The Tribunal has decided that it has no jurisdiction over the claims submitted to it
by the Claimant and so the Respondent has been successful in its jurisdictional
objections. The Tribunal sees no basis upon which it might be concluded that it
would be reasonable for the parties to share the costs of arbitration. Accordingly,
as the unsuccessful party, the Claimant shall bear the full costs of arbitration.

The Parties deposited a total of USD 900,000 (USD 450,000 by the Claimant;
USD 450,000 by the Respondent) with the PCA to cover the costs of arbitration.

The fees and expenses of Prof. Jean-Gabriel Castel, OC, QC, the arbitrator
appointed by the Claimant, amount to USD 273,425.68 and USD 1,483.29,
respectively. The fees and expenses of Dr. Laurent Lévy, the arbitrator appointed
by the Respondent, amount to USD 175,232.85 and USD 28,395.35, respectively.
Dr. Lévy’s fees and expenses are in addition to those of Mr. J. Christopher
Thomas, who served as the arbitrator appointed by the Respondent through
October 21, 2009. The fees and expenses of Mr. Thomas amount to
USD 52,855.00 and USD 3,995.72, respectively. The fees and expenses of
Prof. Juan Fernéndez-Armesto, the Presiding Arbitrator, amount to
USD 253,097.47 and USD 12,788.82, respectively.

Pursuant to the order of the Tribunal and agreement of the Parties, Mrs. Deva
Villania was designated as Administrative Assistant of the Arbitral Tribunal and
the International Bureau of the PCA was designated to act as Registry in this
arbitration. Mrs. Villanta’s fees amount to USD 60,466.02. The PCA’s fees for
registry services amount to USD 36,447.70.

Other tribunal costs, including transcription services, courier deliveries,
conference calling expenses, bank charges, and all other expenses relating to the
arbitration proceedings, amount to USD 1,818.10.

Based on the above figures, the combined tribunal costs, comprising the items
covered in Articles 38(a) to (c) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, total
USD 900,000.

Summing up, the Tribunal decides that the Claimant shall bear the full costs of the
arbitration, and consequently orders the Claimant to reimburse to the Respondent
the deposit towards the arbitration costs already made by the Respondent, in the
amount of USD 450,000.

2. THE Costs OF LEGAL REPRESENTATION AND ASSISTANCE

The costs of legal representation and assistance are the subject of a distinct rule
set out at Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules:

“With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance
referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into
account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine
which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between
the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable”.

Costs of legal representation and assistance are thus not subject to the general
principle that costs shall be borne by the unsuccessful party. Rather, the
UNCITRAL Rules grant the Tribunal discretion as to the allocation of these costs
as between the parties.

The terms of Article 40(2) allow the Tribunal to decide that all the costs of legal
representation and assistance shall be borne by one party (the words “which party
shall bear such costs” referring to a party in the singular) or to apportion such
costs “between the parties”. If the latter path is to be followed, the only guidance
provided by the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules is that the Tribunal must “tak[e]
into account the circumstances of the case”.

The traditional position in investment arbitration, in contrast to commercial
arbitration, has been to follow the practice under public international law that the
parties shall bear their own costs of legal representation and assistance. The
Tribunal, taking the conduct of the parties, the expenses incurred during the
procedure and all other circumstances of the case into consideration, decides to
adhere to such traditional position and finds it equitable that each side bear its
own costs of legal representation and assistance.
