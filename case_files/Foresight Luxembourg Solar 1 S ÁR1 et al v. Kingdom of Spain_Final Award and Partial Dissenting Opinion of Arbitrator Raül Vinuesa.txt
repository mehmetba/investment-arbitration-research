On 5 April 2018, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal requesting that the final
judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Slowakische
Republik v Achmea BV dated 6 March 2018 (Achmea) be entered into the
record and that the Parties be permitted to make comments on the judgment in
their post-hearing brief.’ On 12 April 2018, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal
confirming their agreement to enter the Achmea judgment into the record on

in their reply post-hearing brief.

On 13 June 2018, the Parties exchanged reply post-hearing briefs
(Claimants’ Reply PHB and Respondent’s Reply PHB, respectively).

On 14 June 2018, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to complain that the
Claimants’ submissions in their reply post-hearing brief on the Masdar award
amounted to “ambush” in violation of PO1. On 19 June 2018, the Claimants
wrote to the Tribunal, pointing out inter alia that they had in their cover letter of
18 May 2018 given the Respondent notice of their intention to address the
Masdar award. On 22 June 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties stating that

the Masdar award is admitted into the record and granting the Respondent until
25 June 2018 to submit brief comments on the Masdar award.

On 21 June 2018, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal alleging that the
Claimants had violated PO1 by disclosing information regarding the
Respondent's document production in this arbitration to the law firm Allen &
Overy, who act as counsel for investors in other renewables arbitrations against
Spain. On 26 June 2018, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal to deny that they
had violated PO1 or any other applicable rule. On 28 June 2018, the Tribunal
wrote to the Parties stating that it had noted the points advanced and had
decided to make no order.

On 6 July 2018, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal stating that they had
provided the necessary information in relation to their legal fees and requesting
that the Tribunal deny the Respondent's request of 27 June 2018.

On 13 July 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties stating that the issue of costs
would be dealt with in the Final Award. The Tribunal declined to make any
further order at that time.

On 19 October 2018, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed.
THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY

The ECT was signed in December 1994 and entered into force in April 1998.
The ECT has been signed or acceded to by fifty-two states (including
Luxembourg, Italy, Denmark and Spain), the European Union (EU) and
Euratom.

The Energy Charter Secretariat's Guide summarizes the ECT’s purpose in the
following way:

According to Article 2 of the ECT, the purpose of the Treaty is to establish a
legal framework in order to promote long-term cooperation in the energy field,

10

52.

53.

based on complementarities and mutual benefits, in accordance with the
objectives and principles of the Energy Charter. It is a milestone in international
energy cooperation. By creating a stable, comprehensive and
nondiscriminatory legal foundation for cross-border energy relations, the ECT
reduces political risks associated with economic activities in transition
economies. It creates an economic alliance between countries with different
cultural, economic and legal backgrounds, but all united in their commitment to
achieve the following common goals:

e To provide open energy markets, and to secure and diversify energy
supply;

e To stimulate cross-border investment and trade in the energy sector;

e To assist countries in economic transition in the development of their
energy strategies and of an appropriate institutional and legal
framework for energy, and in the improvement and modernisation of
their energy industries. '°

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The Tribunal will begin by summarizing the factual background to this dispute,
including the applicable Spanish legal framework, the Claimants’ investments
in Spain, and the disputed measures.

A. Overview

The Claimants’ claims concern certain legislative and regulatory measures
introduced by Spain since 2007 to support investment in renewable electricity
generation. The measures were intended to enable Spain to meet national and
EU level targets for electricity generation from renewable energy. In particular,
Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 27 September
2001 (Directive 2001/77/EC) set Spain an indicative target for electricity
energy generation from renewables at 29.4% of total electricity consumption by
2010.'' Pursuant to Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and
Council of 23 April 2009 (Directive 2009/20/EC), this indicative target was later
replaced by a mandatory target for renewable energy consumption set at 20%
of Spain's total energy consumption by 2020.'? These EU directives were
transposed by Spain into its domestic law; as a Member State of the EU,

broader context of the EU’s and Spain’s measures was the international effort
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, most notably in the Kyoto Protocol 1997,
pursuant to which signatories, including the EU and Spain, accepted ambitious
targets for emissions reductions.

Between 8 May 2009 and 7 May 2010,"* the Claimants acquired Spanish
companies that operated three solar photovoltaic (PV) facilities registered
under Royal Decree 661/2007 (RD 661/2007),'° a renewables support scheme
enacted by Spain to achieve its renewable electricity target under Directive
2001/77/EC. Two salient features of RD 661/2007 were that it established fixed
Feed in Tariffs (FiTs) for qualifying PV facilities — ostensibly to be paid for the
lifetime of the facility — and priority of access and dispatch to the electricity grid.

It is important to appreciate that RD 661/2007 was a regulatory instrument and
therefore subordinate as a matter of Spanish law to the relevant Act of
Parliament (Law) that established the general regulatory framework for the
Spanish electricity system (SES). That was Law 54/1997, which liberalized the
SES and updated the parameters of Spain’s legal regime, both for conventional
energy generation (termed the “Ordinary Regime’) and for renewable energy
production and supply (the “Special Regime”). The RD 661/2007 support
scheme operated within the broad framework established by Law 54/1997. Of
particular relevance to the Parties’ dispute, Law 54/1997 also provided that
investors under the Special Regime would receive a “reasonable rate[] of return
with regard to the cost of money in the capital markets”.'7 However,
Law 54/1997 did not specify what this reasonable rate of return should be. That
was left to regulations like RD 661/2007.

RD 661/2007 succeeded in attracting significant investment in renewables;
within just four months of its enactment, installed PV capacity reached 85% of
the target set by RD 661/2007.'® But RD 661/2007 also coincided with — and
indeed exacerbated — a widening gap between regulated electricity access
charges (i.e. the amount retail customers paid for their electricity) and the

regulated costs of the SES (which includes the costs of renewables support
schemes). This shortfall is known as the “tariff deficit”.

The Claimants take issue with a number of measures that were subsequently
enacted by Spain, purportedly to eliminate the tariff deficit. The Claimants
contend that these measures materially reduced the returns on their
investments. In particular, between 2010 and 2013, Spain modified the
incentives available to PV facilities registered under RD 661/2007. Then, in
2013-2014, Spain repealed and replaced RD 661/2007 with what the Claimants
term the “New Regulatory Regime”, which inter alia replaced the fixed FiTs for
PV facilities with remuneration designed to achieve a “reasonable rate of
return” for a “standard plant” of the relevant type, as defined by Spain. The
“reasonable rate of return” was initially set by Spain at the ten-year average of
Spanish Government bond yields plus 3%, which was 7.398% (pre-tax).
However, the Respondent contends that the New Regulatory Regime in fact
maintained the essential characteristics of RD 661/2007, including the payment
of a “subsidy” and priority of access to the grid.

The key measures at issue in this arbitration are summarized in the following

B. Regulatory Framework
(1) Hierarchy of regulatory measures under Spanish law

The SES is regulated under Spanish law by the following instruments, in order
of hierarchy: (i) the Spanish Constitution of 1978; (ii) Acts of the Spanish
Parliament; (iii) Royal Decree-Laws, which have the force of an Act and may
be enacted by the Government in situations of extraordinary need or urgency;
(iv) Royal Decrees, which are regulations issued by the Government pursuant
to powers granted by an Act; (v) Ministerial Orders, which are issued by
ministerial departments (such as the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism)
to implement Royal Decrees; and (vi) Resolutions, which are issued by
Government to also implement Royal Decrees. Finally, in the context of the
SES, there are renewable energy plans, which are regulatory standard-setting
instruments drawn up by the regulator.

(2) Evolution of Spain’s renewable energy regulatory framework
prior to the disputed measures

Spain has a longstanding commitment to the promotion of renewable energy.
In 1994, Spain enacted RD 2366/1994 creating the Special Regime, which is
the name given to Spain’s legal framework for qualifying renewable energy
facilities.2”

The Tribunal summarizes below the relevant key legislative and regulatory
developments that occurred prior to the disputed measures, from Spain’s
liberalization of its electricity market in late 1997 to the enactment of the
RD 661/2007 support scheme under which the Claimants’ PV facilities were
registered.

(i) Law 54/1997

In November 1997, Spain enacted Law 54/1997 to transpose into Spanish law
EU Directive 96/92/EC on the internal market in electricity. To that end,
Law 54/1997 liberalized Spain’s electricity sector — particularly energy
generation (production) and supply — and also committed Spain to produce
12% of its total energy demand from renewables by 2010.78

Law 54/1997 established the essential characteristics of Spain’s regulatory
framework governing the electricity sector, as well as the limits of the regulatory
power of the Spanish government.” Notwithstanding the creation of a free
market system, Law 54/1997 provided that incentives would be offered in order
to promote investment in renewable energy facilities. Specifically, Law 54/1997
provided that remuneration of electricity producers under the Special Regime
would be supplemented by a “premium” that would be established in
subsequent regulations so as to achieve “reasonable rates of return with regard
to the cost of money in the capital market.”

In order to achieve its 12% renewables target by 2010, Law 54/1997 called for
the drawing up of a renewable energies promotion plan that would be taken
into account in the setting of the premiums for renewable energy producers.*'

(ii) Royal Decree 2818/1998

In December 1998, Spain enacted Royal Decree 2818/1998 to implement the
specific parameters of Law 54/1997 applicable to the Special Regime, including
a remuneration framework whereby renewable electricity producers could elect
to receive either: (i) a FiT for each kWh produced; (ii) or a premium to the
market price of the energy produced.** RD 2818/1998 did not prescribe
specific levels of remuneration for an individual facility.

(iii) 2000-2010 Renewable Energies Promotion Plan (1999
PER)

Pursuant to the requirement under Law 54/1997, in December 1999 a
renewable energies promotion plan for the 2000-2010 period (1999 PER) was
prepared by the Institute for Energy Diversification and Savings (IDAE), an
agency of the Spanish government. The plan proposed that a remuneration
scheme be developed through regulations in order to meet the EU’s indicative
target that Spain produce 12% of its total energy demand from renewables by
2010. On 30 December 1999, the plan was approved by Spain’s Council of
Ministers.

(iv) Royal Decree 436/2004

On 27 September 2001, the European Parliament and Council adopted
Directive 2001/77/EC, which set Spain an indicative target for renewable
energy generation at 29.4% of total electricity consumption by 2010.

However, the RD 2818/1998 support scheme failed to attract a sufficient level
of investment in renewable energy for Spain to meetits targets. By 2004, Spain
had achieved only 56.2% of its 2006 objective for renewable electricity
production, and only 28.4% of its target for 2010.°°

In February 2003, the Renewable Energies’ Producers Association (APPA),
which represents over 500 Spanish renewable energy companies, published a
report that recommended improvements to the RD 2818/1998 support scheme.
APPA recommended that: (i) incentives for certain technologies, including solar
PV, be increased in order to guarantee an adequate return on investment; and
(ii) incentives be explicitly guaranteed for the life of the investment.**

In April 2003, Spain’s energy regulator, the National Energy Commission
(CNE), likewise concluded that it was necessary to increase remuneration and
also to guarantee incentives throughout the facilities’ useful life, in order to

encourage sufficient investment and hit Spain’s renewables targets.°°

In March 2004, Spain enacted RD 436/2004, a new renewables support
scheme that addressed several perceived shortcomings of RD 2818/1998. The
purpose of RD 436/2004 as articulated in its preamble was to provide “security
and stability” and to establish a “long-lasting, objective, transparent regulatory
framework” in order to promote investment in renewable electricity
generation.°°

Like RD 2818/1998, RD 436/2004 gave eligible electricity producers the option
to elect to receive either: (i) a FiT; or (ii) the market price plus an incentive for

participating in the market and premium.” RD 436/2004 also continued to
guarantee that producers would receive a “reasonable remuneration”.*®

In order to incentivize investors, RD 436/2004 revised the rate scale for FiTs,
premiums and incentives. For example, PV facilities of 100kW or smaller
received an almost 95% increase in FiT rates.°° However, the FiT rates were
not fixed but were set as percentages of the “Average Electricity Tariff’ (AET),
which was an index determined annually by Spain based on a complex set of
variables affecting the cost of the electricity system, including the cost of the
renewables support scheme itself. Spain only subsequently realised that the
linking of the FiTs to this index created a “feedback loop” whereby growth in
renewable energy generation led to an increase in the AET, which in turn led
to an increase in the FiTs even if the cost per kWh produced did not increase.*°

Notably, RD 436/2004 introduced a provision that any future revisions to the
FiTs, premiums and incentives would not apply to facilities already registered
and in operation under the support scheme.**

(v) Renewable Energies Plan 2005-2010 (2005 PER)

In August 2005, a Renewable Energies Plan for the period 2005-2010
(2005 PER) prepared by IDAE was approved by the Council of Ministers. The
2005 PER revised the 1999 PER and acknowledged the insufficient growth of
Spain’s renewable electricity capability“? In order to meet Spain's target of
29.4% share of renewables in total electricity consumption by 2010 in light of a
projected growth in energy demand, the 2005 PER increased Spain’s installed
PV capacity target for 2010 from 144 MW to 400 MW.*? The 2005 PER also
projected that PV electricity generation would require €1.875 billion in total
capital investment, of which amount nearly 80% would be debt financed.*

(vi) Royal Decree 661/2007

Like RD 2818/1998 before it, RD 436/2004 failed to attract the level of
investment in renewable energy necessary for Spain to meet its 2010 targets.

The shortfall in PV investment was pronounced; whereas the 2005 PER
targeted a PV capacity of 400 MW by 2010, Spain’s installed PV capacity as of
2006 was 84 MW.*°

Consequently, Spain decided to reform the RD 436/2004 support scheme. In
February 2007, the CNE published a report on the draft regulations that would
later become RD 661/2007. The CNE observed inter alia that economic
incentives were necessary to promote the development of renewables and that
‘[i]n certain cases, differentiated incentives are justified that lead to higher
returns, so that the objectives set in the planning can be achieved.”“® The CNE
also called for the draft regulations to be amended to include “sufficient
guarantees to ensure that the economic incentives are stable and predictable
throughout the entire life of the facilities...."47

On 27 May 2007, Spain enacted the new regulation, RD 661/2007, which
repealed and replaced RD 436/2004.

RD 661/2007 introduced several changes to the incentives available to
qualifying renewable electricity producers under the Law 54/1997 general
regulatory framework. Unlike the RD 2818/1998 and RD 436/2004 support
schemes, PV facilities registered under RD 661/2007 were entitled only to a
FiT and were not given the option to receive a premium. But whereas
incentives under RD 436/2004 were based on the AET index — which was
determined annually by Spain — RD 661/2007 fixed the FIT in absolute numbers
(c€/kWh), based on the facility's total electricity generation capacity, for the
whole life of a facility.

Annex V of RD 661/2007 contains the following table setting out the FITs
offered to qualifying PV facilities (“Category b 1.1”), sub-grouped by power
output of the facility.

For each sub-group, there is a fixed FiT that applies for the first 25 years of a
PV facility's operations which is then reduced to 80% of the original tariff for the
remaining life of the facility. The fixed FiT would be adjusted annually for
inflation based on the Consumer Price Index.*® RD 661/2007 does not explain
the methodology by which the fixed FiTs are arrived at.

For PV facilities with a power output of between 100 kW and 10 MW, the fixed
FiT rate in RD 661/2007 represented an almost 82% increase as compared to
the corresponding FiT under RD 436/2004.*° However, the value of FiTs for
PV facilities producing less than 100 kW or more than 10 MW of power
remained virtually unchanged under RD 661/2007.°°

RD 661/2007 also granted renewable producers, including PV facilities, priority
of dispatch and grid access, meaning that they could sell and transmit electricity
whenever it was produced.*!

RD 661/2007 provided that Spain would review the fixed FiT rates in 2010 and
every four years thereafter. Like RD 436/2004, RD 661/2007 required that any
revisions to the FiT rates would guarantee a reasonable rate of return by
reference to the cost of money in the capital markets and would not apply to
facilities already enrolled in the support scheme. In full, the relevant provision
of RD 661/2007, Article 44.3, reads as follows:

During the year 2010, [in view] of the results of the monitoring reports on the
degree of fulfillment of the Renewable Energies Plan (PER) 2005-2010, and of
the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy in Spain (E4), together with such

2011-2020, there shall be a review of the tariffs, premiums, supplements and

lower and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree with regard to the costs
associated with each of these technologies, the degree of participation of the
[S]pecial [R]egime in covering the demand, and its impact on the technical and
economic management of the system, and a reasonable rate of profitability
shall always be guaranteed with reference to the cost of money in the capital
markets. Subsequently a further review shall be performed every four years,
maintaining the same criteria as previously.

The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits indicated in
this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the deed of commissioning
shall have been granted prior to 1 January of the second year following the
year in which the revision shall have been performed.°*

Likewise, in a press announcement on RD 661/2007, Spain stated that:

The tariff revisions carried out in the future will not affect those installations
already operating. This guarantee affords legal safety to the producer,
providing stability to the sector and promoting its development. The new
regulations will not be of a retroactive nature.

In order to receive the fixed FIT under the RD 661/2007 support scheme, PV
facilities were required to obtain a “Final Commissioning Certificate” and be
registered in the regional Administrative Registry for Special Regime
Generation Facilities (RAIPRE).*

Although the Respondent denies that it engaged in a campaign to attract
foreign investment in renewable facilities covered by RD 661/2007, the
Respondent did in fact conduct a number of roadshows for investors around
the world in which its representatives promoted the stability and potential
profitability of the RD 661/2007 support scheme.*>

In any event, private investors responded enthusiastically to RD 661/2007. In

On 26 September 2008, Spain enacted RD 1578/2008, which created a new
support scheme for PV facilities that were not registered by the deadline for
enrollment under RD 661/2007.°° RD 1578/2008 retained the essential
features of RD 661/2007 but reduced the FiTs available to PV facilities.
RD 1578/2008 did not affect the incentives offered to those PV facilities already
registered under RD 661/2007.

(viii) | Spain’s PV capacity following enactment of RD 61/2007

Spain far surpassed the target specified in RD 661/2007, which had been to
achieve an installed PV capacity of 371 MW by 2010. Between 2006 and 2007,
Spain’s installed PV capacity in fact increased from approximately 167 MW to
690 MW. By 2008, it had grown to over 3,000 MW.*° In 2008, Spain accounted
for half of all the solar power installed globally.

By 2010, Spain had achieved an aggregate installed PV capacity of over
3,960 MW.*' This meant that renewable energy supplied 13.2% of Spain's total
energy consumption and 29.2% of its electricity, close to Spain’s 2010 target
of 29.4%.

c. Claimants’ Investments

The Claimants’ investments were comprised of three PV plants: (i) Madridejos,
an 8 MW PV plant, acquired by Foresight 1 in May 2009; (ii) La Castilleja, a

As discussed further below, in August 2011, GMW II contributed its interests in
La Castilleja and Fotocampillos to Greentech and became a parent company
of Greentech.® As of 30 June 2014, Greentech was a direct owner of the La

S.A. (Santander), an investment fund organized within the Spanish Santander
Group.

99. Foresight learned from BP Solar that Santander was looking to sell its interest
in the Madridejos project. Foresight retained PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)
and Landwell Abogados y Asesores Fiscales (Landwell) to conduct due
diligence of the potential acquisition. Foresight also developed a valuation
model to forecast the project’s returns over a 36-year period based on the tariffs
under RD 661/2007. Following this due diligence, Foresight decided to acquire
Madridejos.

100. On 8 May 2009, Foresight | purchased Acacia for over €9.3 million, thereby
acquiring 100% of Madridejos. In their representations and warranties, the
sellers guaranteed that “[Acacia] has entered into all the necessary contracts
in order to buil[d], exploit and maintain the PV Plant according to...Spanish law,
[e]specially...Royal Decree 661/2007, of May 25."°°

to its wholly owned Dutch subsidiary, Foresight Netherlands Solar 1 B.V..

(2) La Castilleja

102. On 25 September 2008, La Castilleja received its RAIPRE registration under
RD 661/2007.

103. La Castilleja was originally owned by Magtel Redes de Telecomunicaciones
S.A.U., a Spanish company. At the time of the Claimants’ acquisition, the
facility was operated by La Castilleja Energia S.L.U.

104. Foresight decided to jointly invest in La Castilleja with GWM II with whom
Foresight had become acquainted through its work in Italy. Foresight and
GWM retained PwC, Landwell and Garrigues to conduct due diligence on the
project.

105. The Claimants describe the acquisition process in the following terms:

On March 18, 2010, Foresight 2 purchased a 49.97225% stake in a Spanish
company that would serve as the joint venture with GWM, called Global Litator
S.L., while GWM II purchased the remaining 50.03775% interest. The same

agreement to purchase the La Castilleja facility for over €58 million. Thus, as
of March 26, 2010, Foresight 2 and GWM jointly owned 100% of La Castilleja
through Global Litator S.L.97

Foresight’s acquisition costs for La Castilleja were approximately €6.35 million
and GWM's acquisition costs were approximately €6.3 million.

(3)  Fotocampillos

On 20 May 2008, the Fotocampillos PV project received their RAIPRE
registrations.

The Fotocampillos park was developed by a company called Abantia Sol de
Malaga S.L., financed with a €12 million loan from the Spanish bank Caja de
Ahorros del Mediterraneo.

The Claimants describe the acquisition process in the following terms:

To carry out the acquisition, on May 3, 2010, the subsidiary of what is now
Claimant GWM Il - GWM Renewable Energy S.p.A. — made a capital
contribution of over €10 million to Lux Energia, acquiring a 61.35% ownership
interest in that company. Then, on May 7, 2010, Lux Energia purchased the
project companies that owned and managed the Fotocampillos facilities. Thus,
as of May 8, 2010, through its wholly owned subsidiary GWM Renewable
Energy S.p.A., GWM II held a 61.35% interest in Fotocampillos.”°

In January 2011, GWM became the 100% owner of the Fotocampillos PV
project when its subsidiary GWM Renewable Energy S.p.A acquired Lux
Energia.”

GWM'ss acquisition costs for Fotocampillos were approximately €3.8 million.’

Consequently, the Claimants contend that the interests of GWM Il and
Greentech in this arbitration are coextensive.’

D. Spain’s tariff deficit and the sustainability of the Spanish
electricity system

After enacting RD 661/2007, Spain became increasingly concerned by its
growing “tariff deficit’, which is the difference between the regulated costs of
the SES, on the one hand, and revenues from regulated electricity prices paid
by consumers, on the other. In short, the SES did not generate enough
revenue to cover the costs of FiTs and other remuneration.

Spain’s tariff deficit was attributable to several factors. These include the fact
that actual electricity consumption in Spain fell below forecasts in the 2005 PER
as a result of the global financial crisis and subsequent recession in Spain.’¢
However, the tariff deficit had in fact emerged several years earlier and is not
therefore exclusively the product of the financial crisis.

As illustrated by the following chart taken from the first report of Drs Moselle
and Grunwald of FTI, Spain’s annual tariff deficit first materialized in 2000 and
subsequently grew to over €6 billion for the year 2008, before returning to
surplus in 2014:

On an accumulated basis, Spain’s tariff deficit exceeded €40 billion by 2013

(approximately 4% of GDP), an increase of 271% from 2007, when the

accumulated deficit stood at approximately €10.8 billion.”®

In April 2009, Spain enacted Royal Decree-Law 6/2009 (RDL 6/2009), which
adopted certain measures to address the tariff deficit. The preamble to
RDL 6/2009 explains that:

The increasing tariff deficit [...]is causing serious problems which in the current
context of international financial crisis, is profoundly affecting the system and
endangering, not only the financial situation of the companies in the electricity
sector, but the system’s sustainability itself. This imbalance is unsustainable
and has serious consequences by deteriorating the security and investment
financing capacity necessary to supply electricity in the quality and safety
levels demanded by Spanish society. [...] by its increasing incidence on the
tariff deficit, mechanisms are established with regard to the remuneration
system of the facilities under the special regime. The trends followed by these
technologies could put at risk in the short term, the sustainability of the system,
both from the economic point of view due to their impact on the electricity tariff,
and from a technical point of view, further compromising the economic viability
of the already completed facilities, whose operation depends on the proper
balance between manageable and non-manageable generation. 7

123.

In addition to RDL 6/2009, Spain adopted several other measures addressed
to the tariff deficit, including those discussed in the following section on the
disputed measures in this arbitration.

The tariff deficit became a political issue in Spain. In his inaugural speech on
19 December 2011, the newly elected prime minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy,
stated:

Another essential structural reform concerns our energy system. Energy policy
must aim to pursue an adequate balance between its objectives:
competitiveness, security of supply and environmental impacts [...]. Energy is
a key factor in the competitiveness of Spanish companies. It is important for
us to realise Spain has a major energy problem, especially in the electricity
sector, with an annual deficit in excess of 3,000 million Euros, and an accrued
tariff deficit of more than 22,000 million.

 

Electricity tariffs for domestic consumers are the third most expensive in
Europe, and the fifth highest for industrial consumers.

L..] If reforms are not made, the imbalances will be unsustainable, and
increases in prices and tariffs will place Spain at the greatest disadvantage in
terms of energy costs in the entire developed world. We must therefore
introduce policies based on putting a break on and reducing the average costs
of the system, take decisions without demagoguery, employ all the
technologies available, without exception, and regulate with the
competitiveness of our economy as our prime objective.®°

In March 2012, the CNE published a report in response to a request from the

Security of State for Energy to propose regulatory adjustment measures to
address the tariff deficit. The CNE report stated that:

[T]he current situation is unsustainable. The introduction of regulatory
measures, as requested by the document of the [Secretary of State for Energy],
is called for with immediate effect in the short term, in order to eliminate the
deficit of the system, mitigate the cost of funding the yet unsecuritised debt and
clearly define the access costs that will be assumed by electricity customers,
in order to determine their access tariffs in a satisfactory and stable manner.®!

Among the short-term measures proposed by the CNE was the removal of
annual CPI indexing for FiTs, and the elimination of FiTs at the end of the
economic (or useful) life of a facility (as opposed to its operating life).

On 20 July 2012, as part of an EU financial assistance package relating to the
financial crisis in Spain, the Respondent signed a Memorandum of

E. The Disputed Measures
(i) RD 1565/2010

In November 2010, Spain enacted Royal Decree 1565/2010, which cancelled
the right of PV facilities to receive the FiTs specified in RD 661/2007 after the
first 25 years of their operation.®*

However, in response to criticism, Spain subsequently extended the cut-off to
28 years in RDL 14/2010, and then to 30 years in Law 2/2011.%

(ii) RDL 14/2010

In December 2010, Spain enacted Royal Decree-Law 14/2010, which
concerned urgent measures to address the tariff deficit.®°

RDL 14/2010 capped the annual operating hours (i.e. the total quantity of
electricity produced) for which PV facilities could receive FiTs under
RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008.’ The actual operating hour limit depended
on the type of PV technology and geographic location.®® PV facilities in
locations with higher solar radiation had a higher cap. Once a PV facility hit the
applicable cap, additional electricity could only be sold at market prices.

RDL 14/2010 also established a new 0.5 EU/MWh “access toll” on all electricity
a producer delivered to the grid.

(iii) Law 15/2012

In December 2012, Spain enacted Law 15/2012, which introduced a 7%
“energy production value tax” on all revenues (including FiT revenues) derived
from the production of electricity (TVPEE).®°

(iv) — RDL 2/2013

In February 2013, Spain enacted Royal Decree-Law 2/2013, which introduced
an “amended CPI” that excluded prices changes in food, energy products and
certain tax effects for the purposes of calculating annual FIT inflation revisions
under RD 661/2007 (and RD 1578/2008).°° Initially, the amended CPI was
lower than the general CPI. However, from late 2014, the amended CPI was
higher than the general CPI.°

(v) RDL 9/2013

In July 2013, Spain enacted RDL 9/2013, concerning the tariff deficit and
“urgent measures to guarantee the financial stability of the electricity system”.°?
RDL 9/2013 abolished the RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 support schemes
— including the FiT regime — and authorized the government to approve a new
legal framework for renewable energy production.

Pursuant to Article 1(2) RDL 9/2013, Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997 was modified
as follows:

4. Additionally, and in the terms set forth in the regulations by royal decree of
the Board of Ministers, for the compensation of the sale of generated energy
valued at market price, the facility can receive a specific compensation
composed of one period by unit of installed power that covers, when applicable,
the investment costs of a typical facility that cannot be recovered by the sale
of energy and one period of operation that covers, in any case, the difference
between the exploitation costs and the income for the market share of said
typical facility.

For the calculation of said specific remuneration, the following aspects shall be
considered, taking into account a standard facility throughout its legal service
life, according to the activity performed by an efficient, well-managed business:

a) The standard income for the sale of generated energy valued at the price of
the production market.

b) The standard exploitation cost.

c) The standard value of the initial investment.

To these effects, in no case, will the costs and investments that come
determined by norms or administrative actions that are not applicable in all the
Spanish territory be considered. In the same manner, only those costs and
investments are taken into account that respond exclusively to the electrical
energy production activity.

As a consequence of the peculiar characteristics of the electrical systems
internal and external to the Iberian peninsula, specific type installations can be
exceptionally defined for each one of them.

C-91, Royal Decree-Law 9/2013.

134.

135.

This compensation regime will not surpass the minimum level necessary to
cover the costs that will allow the installations to compete on an equal level
with the rest of the technologies in the marketplace and that permit the
possibility of obtaining a reasonable profit in reference to the installation type
in each applicable case. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the compensating
regime can also exceptionally incorporate an investment and execution
incentive within a determined period of time when its installation supposes a
significant cost reduction in the insular and extra-peninsular systems.

This reasonable profitability will be based, before taxes, on the average yield

in the secondary market of the Obligations of the State to ten years applying

the adequate differential.9°
The gist of the new framework envisaged by RDL 9/2013 — the precise details
of which were left to subsequent legislation and regulations — was that all
renewable energy facilities would be required to sell electricity on the wholesale
market; instead of FiTs, producers would receive the market price plus
remuneration designed to achieve a “reasonable rate of return” for a “standard”
facility over a defined regulatory life.°* RDL 9/2013 set the target rate of return
at 300 points above the ten-year average yield of Spanish government ten-year
bonds.°>

RDL 9/2013 provided that PV facilities would temporarily continue to receive
remuneration under the RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 support schemes
until the new legal framework was enacted. However, any such payments
would be subject to a “true-up” adjustment (or claw back) once the new
framework was in force.%®

(vi) Law 24/2013, RD 413/2014 and MO IET/1045/2014

In December 2013, Spain enacted Law 24/2013 to implement the new
renewable energies framework envisaged by RDL 9/2013. Law 24/2013
eliminated the distinction between the Ordinary and Special Regimes that had
prevailed under Law 54/1997. % Law 24/2013 further provided that
remuneration under the new renewables support scheme would be “compatible
with the economic stability of the electric system” and would:

“not exceed the minimum level required to cover the costs which allow the

production installations from sources of renewable energies ... to compete on
an equal footing with the other technologies on the market and which allows a

fair return to be obtained pertaining to the standard installation applicable in
each case”.9%

Following the enactment of the new general framework for renewables under
Law 24/2013, a new support scheme was established by RD 413/2014 and
supplemented by Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 (MO 1045), which detailed
precisely how remuneration for PV facilities would be calculated.

In sum, remuneration of renewable energy facilities under the new support
scheme was comprised of:

(a) Market remuneration from the sale of electricity in the wholesale market
(€/MWh); and

(b) “specific remuneration’, which was based on “standard” not actual costs
of a PV facility and consisted of:

(i) an “operating incentive” (or “Return on operation”), calculated
per unit of electricity produced (€/MWh), to compensate facilities
for operating expenses not covered by the wholesale price of
electricity; and

(ii) an “investment incentive” (or “Return on_ investment’),
calculated per unit of installed capacity (€/MWh), to enable
investors to cover their investment (capital) costs and receive a
“reasonable rate of return” over a defined regulatory life, which
was set at 30 years for PV facilities. The “reasonable rate of
return” prescribed by Spain was initially the 10-year average of
Spanish 10-year treasury bonds, plus 300 basis points, which
was 7.398% pre-tax for 2013-2018.°°

The formula for calculating the “specific remuneration” that a PV facility would
receive was published in MO 1045, a 1,761-page document that sets the
“remuneration parameters” for 1,517 different “standard facilities”, including
578 different “standard” PV facilities.

Pursuant to MO 1045, each PV facility was assigned one of 578 “standard”
facility codes (known as “IT codes”) on the basis of several factors, including

C-180, Law 24/2013, Art. 7. The Respondent's translation (R-47) uses the term “reasonable return”
rather than “fair return”.
C-91, RDL 9/2013, Art. 1.2; C-90, RD 413/2014, Art. 11; C-179, MO 1045, Art. 5.1.

technology type, capacity, date of installation and location.'!°° Within each IT
code, MO 1045 sets out the parameters of compensation applicable to that
standard facility, including: an imputed investment cost; estimated current
operating costs; estimated future operating costs; estimated hours of operation;
estimated daily and intraday market prices of electricity; and net asset value of
the facility.'°"

MO 1045 also set a minimum operating hours threshold for a PV facility to
receive the operating incentive and investment incentive, as well as a maximum
operating hours threshold to receive the operating incentive. '°

The parameters used to set the operating incentive were subject to revision
every three years. The parameters for the investment incentive and the level
of the “reasonable rate of return” were subject to revision every six years. '°>
Although the initial target reasonable rate of return (7.398% pre-tax) was based
on the ten-year average yield of ten-year Spanish treasury bonds, the periodic
review would be based on a two-year average of the ten-year bond, taking into
account “the cyclical state of the economy, the electricity demand and an
appropriate remuneration.”

G. Spanish Domestic Court Decisions

In Spain, it is the courts that control the exercise of regulatory power by the
Executive branch.'°

The Respondent has entered into the record over one hundred judgments of
the Spanish Supreme Court concerning the Special Regime support schemes.

Of those, the following seven judgments pre-date the Claimants’ investments:

(a) 15 December 2005, concerning a challenge to the application of
RD 436/2004 to facilities under RD 2366/1994 or RD 2818/1998;'°

(b) 25 October 2006''° and 20 March 2007,'"' concerning a challenge to
an amendment to RD 2818/1998;

(c) 9 October 2007, concerning a challenge to RD 1454/2005;1'2

(d) 9 December 2009, concerning a challenge to articles 28, 45.4 and 5 of
RD 661/2007;'°

(e) 3 December 2009, concerning a challenge to Transitory Provision No. 1
of RD 661/2007.1'4

Since the Claimants’ made their investments, the Spanish courts have issued
several decisions concerning the changes to the RD 661/2007 support
scheme.

Greentech also received an additional payment of €0.4 million to settle intercompany balances and
atax payment. Edwards 2"4, q 4.41; RE-336: Greentech’s Share Sale and Purchase Agreement of

On 17 December 2015, the Spanish Constitutional Court ruled that the New
Regulatory Regime was valid and neither violated investors’ legitimate
expectations, nor had prohibited retroactive effect as a matter of Spanish
law.15

On 12 July 2016, the Spanish Supreme Court rejected a challenge to
RD 413/2014 and MO 1045/2014, stating:

It is not possible to counter the support through subsidies for renewable energy
generation and the defence of the system's financial sustainability, when the
latter is a necessary condition for the very survival thereof, since it is senseless
to design a support system for these technologies that is financially
unsustainable and, accordingly, is not economically viable in the medium and
long term."®

JURISDICTION

The Respondent has raised two objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

A.

First Objection: The Intra-EU Objection

The Respondent's first objection to jurisdiction is that the ECT does not apply

to so-called “intra-EU” disputes, such as the present case, where the Claimants

are nationals of EU Member States and the Respondent is also an EU Member

State.

There are several distinct aspects to the Respondent's “intra-EU” objection,

including:

(a)

The interpretation of Article 26(1) ECT, which limits the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction to disputes “between a Contracting Party and an Investor of
another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the
Area of the former...”;

The question of whether or not, in the event of a conflict, EU law prevails
over the ECT by virtue of Article 26(6) ECT, which provides that the
Tribunal “shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this
Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law’; and

The question of whether or not the ECT in fact conflicts with EU law, in
particular as regards (1) the submission of an “intra-EU” investor-State
dispute under the ECT to international arbitration rather than to the
domestic courts of the EU, and (2) EU rules governing State aid.

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. Respondent’s Position
(i) Overview

The Respondent contends that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over
“intra-EU” disputes because the ECT is incompatible with applicable EU law,
specifically (i) as regards investor-State arbitration, and (ii) EU rules on State
aid.

There are several elements to the Respondent's jurisdictional objection,
including that: (i) there is not a dispute “between a Contracting Party and an
Investor of another Contracting Party” for the purposes of Article 26(1) ECT
because the EU is a Contracting Party and the Claimants are also EU nationals;
(ii) pursuant to Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU)
(the procedure for preliminary reference from EU Member State courts to the
Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU)) and Article 344 TFEU (enshrining the
autonomy of the EU legal system), the interpretation of EU law is the exclusive
preserve of the EU judicial system, which does not include arbitral tribunals
constituted under investment treaties;''® (iii) the Tribunal must interpret the
ECT in accordance with applicable EU law pursuant to Article 26(6) ECT;
(iv) the Tribunal is required to apply EU law because the subject matter of this
dispute concerns a support scheme that qualified as State aid under EU law;
(v) in the event of a conflict, EU law prevails over express provisions of the
ECT; (vi) there is such a conflict in the present case because (a) EU law forbids
EU Member States from arbitrating disputes with EU investors, and also (b) an
award of damages by the Tribunal would be contrary to EU State aid rules, and
the Tribunal may not interfere with the judicial competence of the EU; and
(vii) the only interpretation of Article 26(1) ECT that is compatible with EU law
is one that precludes an EU investor from bringing an ECT arbitration against
an EU Member State.

The Respondent relies on the final judgment issued on 6 March 2018 by the
CJEU in the Achmea case (Achmea Judgment),'®° which the Respondent
contends confirms that intra-EU disputes under the ECT are precluded by

RL-1, Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (“TFEU”).
RL-96, Achmea Judgment.

121

binding EU law. The Respondent also notes that enforcement of the
Novenergia v. Spain award in the Svea Court has been suspended pending
annulment based on the Achmea Judgment.'?"

(ii) — Article 26(1) ECT

The Respondent contends that the Claimants are not protected investors under
the ECT because the dispute is not “between a Contracting Party and an
Investor of another Contracting Party” for the purposes of Article 26(1) ECT.

The Respondent does not deny that Luxembourg, Denmark, Italy and Spain all
individually ratified the ECT as Contracting Parties in their own right. However,
the Respondent contends that the Claimants are not protected investors “of
another Contracting Party’ because: (1) the Claimants are nationals of
Luxembourg, Denmark and Italy, which are EU Member States; (2) the
Respondent, Spain, is also an EU Member State; and (3) the EU is itself a
Contracting Party to the ECT.

The Respondent contends that its interpretation of Article 26(1) ECT is
consistent with the object and purpose of the ECT. In this regard, the
Respondent contends that the ECT was intended, following the fall of the Berlin
Wall, to promote East/West cooperation between regions of Europe that had
been divided by the Iron Curtain; the ECT’s investment protections were never
intended to operate within EU Member States.

The Respondent also relies on the fact that the definition of “Contracting Party”
under Article 1(2) ECT includes “Regional Economic Integration Organisations”
(ORIE), which are in turn defined at Article 1(3) ECT as:

an organisation constituted by states to which they have transferred
competence over certain matters a number of which are governed by this
Treaty, including the authority to take decisions binding on them in respect of
those matters.
The Respondent submits that the EU is the only ORIE that is a Contracting
Party to the ECT. Accordingly, the Respondent contends, Article 1(3) ECT (and
Article 1(10) defining the “Area” of an ORIE) demonstrates that the ECT was
not intended to interfere with matters over which contracting States have
transferred competence to the EU, including investor protection.

Respondent's PHB, § 15.

38

164.

165.

122

(iii) Primacy of EU law

The Respondent submits that the “essential principle of which the objection to
the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal is raised by the Kingdom of Spain’ is “the
principle of primacy of EU law’.

The Respondent contends that the following provisions and declarations in the
ECT establish the primacy of EU law over the ECT:

(a) Article 16 ECT, pursuant to which a more favourable provision to an
investor or investment in another treaty between two or more
Contracting Parties concerning the same subject matter prevails over
the ECT;

(b) Article 25 ECT, which provides that:

(1) The provisions of this Treaty shall not be so construed as to oblige
a Contracting Party which is party to an Economic Integration
Agreement (hereinafter referred to as “EIA”) to extend, by means of
most favoured nation treatment, to another Contracting Party which is
not a party to that EIA, any preferential treatment applicable between
the parties to that EIA as a result of their being parties thereto.

(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), “EIA” means an agreement
substantially liberalising, inter alia, trade and investment, by providing
for the absence or elimination of substantially all discrimination
between or among parties thereto through the elimination of existing
discriminatory measures and/or the prohibition of new or more
discriminatory measures, either at the entry into force of that
agreement or on the basis of a reasonable time frame.

(c) The European Community's declaration to Article 25 ECT, which states:

[...] the application of Article 25 of the Energy Charter Treaty will allow
only those derogations necessary to safeguard the preferential
treatment resulting from the wider process of economic integration
resulting from the Treaties establishing the European Communities.

(d) Article 36(7) ECT, which states that, in respect of decisions taken by
the Charter Conference, a REIO shall have the number of votes equal
to the number of its member States that are Contracting Parties; and

(e) Article 26(6) ECT, which states that an investor-State arbitral tribunal
established under the ECT “shall decide the issues in dispute in

Rejoinder/Reply, § 72.

39

166.

167.

168.

170.

171.

172.

123

accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of
international law’, which the Respondent contends includes EU law.

(iv) | EU law prevails over conflicting provisions of ECT

The Respondent contends that there is a conflict between the ECT and EU law
because EU law does not permit arbitration under the ECT between an EU
investor and an EU Member State. In this situation, the Respondent contends
that EU law must prevail over the ECT.

In particular, the Respondent contends that Article 26(6) ECT requires the
Tribunal to apply EU law as the “applicable rules and principles of international
law”. This in turn directs the Tribunal to Article 344 TFEU, which provides that:

Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation

or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those
provided for therein. 123

According to the Respondent, EU Member States are therefore prohibited by
Article 344 TFEU from submitting to ECT arbitration any matters relating to the
EU internal market in electricity, over which the Respondent has transferred its
sovereignty to the EU.

Further, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal may not interfere with the
competencies of the CJUEU.

As far as the Respondent is concerned, the EU has its own intra-EU system of
investor protection that is preferential to the protection conferred by the ECT
and any BIT. Further still, the Claimants enjoy the full protection of EU law, and
should be pursuing their claim in the courts of the EU.

(v) CJEU’s Achmea Judgment

The Respondent submits that Achmea Judgment is fully applicable to the
present dispute and confirms that the Respondent's “intra-EU objection” to
jurisdiction should be upheld.

In particular, the Respondent contends that the Achmea Judgment precludes
an investor from an EU Member State from bringing arbitration proceedings
against another EU Member State under the ECT.

RL-1, TFEU, Article 344.

40

173.

174.

175.

176.

124
125

The Respondent relies on the CJEU’s ruling that:

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an
international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8
of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments
between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative
Republic, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in
the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring
proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose
jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept. '24

The Respondent contends that the ECT is such an “international agreement

concluded between Member States” and the effect of the Achmea Judgment is

not limited to disputes under bilateral investment agreements.

The Respondent contends that the Tribunal must apply EU law to this dispute
because EU law is “international law” for the purposes of Article 26(6) ECT, the
governing law clause of the Treaty, which provides that the Tribunal “shall
decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules
and principles of international law’. In particular, the Respondent contends, the
Tribunal must give effect to the EU Treaties, the Decision of the European
Commission concerning Spain’s renewables support scheme and State aid
dated 10 November 2017 (EC State Aid Decision), '% and the Achmea
Judgment.

b. Claimants’ Position
(i) Overview

The Claimants submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over so-called “intra-EU
disputes”. The Claimants rely primarily on the language of Article 26(1) ECT,
which provides for the settlement of disputes “between a Contracting Party and
an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter
in an Area of the former.” The Claimants contend that these jurisdictional
requirements are satisfied here because they are nationals of Contracting
Parties to the ECT and the Respondent is also a Contracting Party. In
accordance with the rules of treaty interpretation, there is no need for the

127

Tribunal to look beyond the unambiguous language of Article 26(1) ECT in
deciding this issue.

In any event, the Claimants reject the Respondent's contentions that EU law
grants “preferential” investment protections or that there is any conflict between
the ECT and EU law such that EU law would prevail over the ECT’s investor-
State dispute settlement mechanism.

The Claimants further rely on the unanimous practice of twenty investment
treaty tribunals considering this issue, all of which have concluded that the ECT
applies to intra-EU disputes.

Finally, the Claimants reject the CJEU’s Achmea Judgment as irrelevant to the
present dispute. The Claimants rely on the recent ECT award in Masdar v.
Spain, which found the Achmea Judgment to be inapplicable to ECT cases. "76

(ii) — Article 26(1) ECT

The Claimants contend that the Tribunal must exercise jurisdiction over this
dispute according to the clear terms of Article 26(1) ECT because Spain is a
Contracting Party to the ECT and the Claimants are nationals of “another”
Contracting Party (Luxembourg, Denmark and Italy, respectively).

The Claimants contend that it is irrelevant that the EU is also a Contracting
Party to the ECT: the present dispute is against Spain, not the EU.

The Claimants reject the Respondent's contention that Article 26(6) ECT
requires the Tribunal to apply EU law to this dispute. Rather, the Claimants
contend, the reference to international law in Article 26(6) ECT requires the
Tribunal to apply the ECT according to its provisions, as well as in accordance
with the applicable rules of public international law, but not the regional law of
the EU. In sum, Article 26(6) ECT is not a “back door” for the application of
another set of legal rules outside the Treaty.

The Claimants further contend that the case law on this issue is unanimous,
consistent and definitive in finding that the ECT applies to intra-EU disputes. '?”
For example, the Claimants contend that the tribunal in Eiser v. Spain rejected

CL-189, Masdar, § 679.
Claimants’ PHB, § 24.

42

184.

185.

186.

129
130

exactly the same arguments that the Respondent now advances in this case.
In Eiser, the tribunal stated that:

...Respondent's arguments do not justify disregarding the ECT’s ordinary
meaning in order to exclude a potentially significant body of claims. It is a
fundamental rule of international law that treaties are to be interpreted in good
faith. As a corollary, treaty makers should be understood to carry out their
function in good faith, and not to lay traps for the unwary with hidden meanings
and sweeping implied exclusions.

[...] The Tribunal finds nothing ambiguous or obscure in the interpretation of
Article 26 [of the ECT], so recourse to supplementary means of interpretation
is not required, or even permitted.

Even were the circumstances to warrant recourse to supplementary means of
interpretation, Respondent has not offered evidence to document its
characterization of the [EU Member States’] supposed negotiating objective in
the ECT negotiations. Of perhaps greater significance, there is no evidence
showing that any such objective was shared by all [EU Member States], or was
communicated to and accepted by the other parties to the treaty.'178

(iii) No disconnection clause excluding “intra-EU” claims

The Claimants reject the Respondent's contention that EU Member States
either did not have the competence or did not intend to enter into obligations
as between themselves when they ratified the ECT. The Claimants contend
that the absence of a “disconnection clause” is fatal to the Respondent's
position. Whereas a disconnection clause has been included in certain treaties
to make them, in whole or in part, inapplicable between EU Member States, 7°
there is no such provision in the ECT.

Further, even if a disconnection clause could be implied, the Claimants rely on
the conclusion of the tribunal in Charanne v. Spain, which held that there was
no need to consider the disconnection issue because “there is no conflict
between the [ECT and the TFEU]...no contradiction exists in this case between
the ECT and EU law.”

(iv) No conflict with EU law

The Claimants contend that the Respondent mischaracterizes both the
principle of EU “primacy” and Article 25 ECT. The Claimants contend that the
“primacy” issue is not relevant because it only arises where an EU Member

132

State enacts a measure that conflicts with existing EU law. The Claimants deny
that Article 25 ECT explicitly recognizes the primacy of EU law. Rather, the
Claimants contend that Article 25 ECT could only apply to the treatment that
Spain must accord to nationals outside the EU.

The Claimants deny that there is any conflict in the present case between the
ECT and EU law. In particular, the Claimants contend that the ECT and EU
law do not share the same subject matter and, crucially, EU law does not afford
investors a right to international arbitration. Moreover, the Claimants contend
there is no need to interpret EU law to resolve the dispute because the
Claimants’ claims are based exclusively on the ECT. Indeed, the Claimants
have not submitted any claims of violation of EU law in this arbitration. Rather,
the Claimants seek compensation for Spain’s alleged violations of its
obligations under the ECT.

The Claimants rely inter alia on the award in Eiser v. Spain, where the tribunal
stated:

The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is derived from the express terms of the ECT, a
binding treaty under international law. The Tribunal is not an institution of the
European legal order, and is not subject to the requirements of that legal order.
However, the Tribunal need not address the possible consequences that might
arise in case of a conflict between its role under the ECT and the European
legal order, because no such conflict has been shown to exist. '3"
The Claimants also rely on the CJEU Advocate General’s observation in his
opinion in the Achmea case, where he stated that the EC could not “offer the
slightest explanation of the how the prohibition of illegal expropriation [under
the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT] is incompatible with the EU and FEU

Treaties.”192

Even assuming a conflict between the ECT and EU law existed, the Claimants
contend that the ECT would prevail over EU law. The Claimants rely on
Article 16 ECT, which provides that:

Where two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior international
agreement, or enter into a subsequent international agreement, whose terms
in either case concern the subject matter of Part III [Investment Promotion and
Protection] or V [Dispute Settlement] of [the ECT],

134

(1) nothing in Part Ill or V of this Treaty shall be construed to derogate from
any provision of such terms of the other agreement or from any right to dispute
resolution with respect thereto under that agreement, and

(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed to derogate
from any provision of Part Ill or V of this Treaty or from any right to dispute
resolution with respect thereto under this Treaty, where any such provision is
more favorable to the Investor or Investment.

The Claimants further rely on the following analysis of Article 16(2) ECT by the
Eiser tribunal:
To the extent that provisions of European law may in some manner provide
protections more favorable to Investors or Investments than those under the
ECT, Article 16(2) makes clear that they do not detract from or supersede other
ECT provisions, in particular the right to dispute settlement under ECT Part V.
By its terms, Article 16 assures Investors or their Investments the greatest
protection available under either the ECT or the other agreement. Thus, an
agreement covered by Article 16(2) may improve upon particular protections
available to Investors or their Investments, but it cannot lessen rights or
protections under the ECT that are in other respects more favorable.'%
The Claimants contend that the upshot of Article 16 ECT is that EU law would
only take priority over the dispute settlement provision in the ECT if EU law
afforded the Claimants a “more favourable” dispute settlement mechanism.
However, the Claimants contend that their right to investor-State arbitration
under the ECT is in fact more favourable than pursuing remedies under EU
law, which would first require them to litigate in Spain’s courts.

Thus, Article 26 ECT, and in particular the Claimants’ right to international
arbitration under the ECT, trumps EU law that allegedly may be in conflict with
the ECT.

The Claimants also reject the Respondent's interpretation of Article 344 TFEU.
Quoting the provision, the Claimants contend that Article 344 TFEU only
prevents EU Member States from “submit[ting] a dispute concerning the
interpretation or application of the [Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and
TFEU] to any method of settlement other than those provided for therein”. '*
Article 344 TFEU is therefore inapplicable because the Claimants have not
invoked either the TEU or TFEU in this arbitration.

The Claimants also reject the Respondent's arguments that the ECT conflicts
with EU State aid law. Further, the Claimants contend that the EC State Aid
Decision is irrelevant to the Respondent's jurisdictional objection (as well as

CL-170, Elser, § 202.

RL-1, TFEU, Article 344.

45

197.

195
136

the Claimants’ legitimate expectations claim). The Claimants rely on the
Novenergia award, which decided that the EC State Aid Decision was irrelevant

to Spain’s “intra-EU” jurisdictional objection in that case because it concerned
breaches of the ECT, not EU law.'%°

(v) The CJEU’s Achmea Judgment

The Claimants contend that the CJEU’s Achmea Judgment is irrelevant to the
present dispute, for four principal reasons: (i) the literal jurisdictional
requirements of Article 26(1) and (2) ECT, which is the exclusive basis for the
Tribunal's jurisdiction, are met, and therefore the Tribunal must conclude that
it has jurisdiction to hear the dispute; (ii) the CUEU’s Achmea Judgment has no
impact on the reasoning of the known investment treaty awards to have
considered this issue, all of which have unanimously rejected the “intra-EU”
objection; (iii) even if relevant, the CJEU’s Achmea Judgment is clearly
distinguishable because (a) the decision concerns an intra-EU BIT “concluded
between Member States”, '*° whereas by contrast the ECT is a multilateral
investment treaty to which the EU is a Contracting Party, and (b) unlike
Article 8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT at issue in Achmea (which required
that tribunal to apply the domestic law of the host State or other relevant
agreements between the contracting parties to the BIT), the governing law
clause of the ECT (Article 26(6)) does not permit the Tribunal to interpret or
apply EU law, so it does not matter that the Tribunal is not a “tribunal or court”
that can refer questions of EU law to the CJEU pursuant to Article 267 TFEU;
and (iv) the theoretical future impact (if any) of the CUEU’s Achmea Judgment
on the Claimants’ ability to enforce an award in certain EU jurisdictions is not a
relevant factor for the Tribunal in determining this issue.

(vi) Masdar v. Spain

The Claimants rely on the decision of the ECT tribunal in Masdar v. Spain,
which is the first award rendered by an ECT tribunal since the CJEU’s Achmea
Judgment. The Claimants contend that the Masdar tribunal rejected the same
arguments on the “intra-EU” objection that the Respondent puts forward in this
case. In sum, the Claimants submit that there is no reason why the Tribunal
should reach a different decision to the Masdar tribunal, which concluded that

198.

137
138

“the Achmea Judgment has no bearing upon the present case” because “it
does not take into consideration, and thus it cannot be applied to, multilateral
treaties, such as the ECT, to which the EU itself is a party”.'%”

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The crux of this jurisdictional objection is the question of whether or not the
dispute settlement clause under Article 26 ECT excludes disputes between
Investors of EU Member States, on the one hand, and a Contracting Party to
the ECT that is an EU Member State, on the other. The Respondent contends
that the Tribunal must look beyond the plain language of Article 26 ECT, which
contains no such exclusion on its face. Ultimately, the Respondent's position
is that Article 26 ECT should be read as excluding arbitration of “intra-EU”
investor-State disputes because EU law forbids it.

The Tribunal takes the opportunity here to comment that the European
Commission has submitted a clear and helpful Amicus Brief addressing this
issue. The Tribunal has carefully considered the Commission's submissions.
However, since the Commission is not a party to these proceedings, and both
Parties elected not to directly comment on the Commission’s brief or any part
thereof,'®* the Tribunal's analysis below deals only with the Claimants’ and the
Respondent's submissions on this issue.

The Tribunal turns to the interpretation of Article 26 ECT, which provides in
relevant part as follows:

(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the
former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under
Part Ill shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions of paragraph
(1) within a period of three months [...] the Investor party to the dispute may
choose to submit it for resolution:

(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.
(3) (a) [...] each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the

submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance
with the provisions of this Article. [...]

As any other treaty provision, the text of Article 26 ECT must be interpreted in
accordance with the normal canons of treaty interpretation contained in

CL-189, Masdar, 679.
Hr. Day 1, 152:7-153:10.

Article 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT),
which provide as follows:

Article 31. GENERAL RULE OF INTERPRETATION

1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light
of its object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise,
in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the
parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection
with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an
instrument related to the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the
interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;

(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which
establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;

(c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations
between the parties.

4. Aspecial meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties
so intended.

Article 32. SUPPLEMENTARY MEANS OF INTERPRETATION

Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the
preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order
to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to
determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:

(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or

(b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.
In short, Article 31 VCLT is the primary rule of treaty interpretation. In limited
circumstances, the Tribunal may have regard to the supplementary means of
interpretation under Article 32 VCLT.

Accordingly, the Tribunal begins the interpretative exercise by considering the
ordinary meaning of the ECT’s terms, their context, and the object and purpose
of the ECT. Pursuant to Article 31(2) VCLT, “t[h]e context for the purpose of
the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise [...] the text, including its preamble
and annexes [...].”

48

204.

205.

209.

The Tribunal must also interpret the text of the ECT in accordance with
Article 31(3)(c) VCLT, which requires that “[a]ny relevant rules of international
law applicable in the relations between the parties” shall be taken into account
together with the context.

The Tribunal considers that the context of Article 26 ECT includes:

(a) Article 1(2) ECT, which defines “Contracting Party” as “a state or
Regional Economic Integration Organization which has consented to be
bound by this Treaty and for which the Treaty is in force.”;

(b) Article 1(7)(a)(ii) ECT, which defines “Investor” of a Contracting Party
as “a company or other organization organized in accordance with the
law applicable in that Contracting Party.”;

(c) Article 10(1) ECT, by which Contracting Parties to the ECT promise to
accord certain international standards of treatment, including fair and
equitable treatment, to “Investments of Investors of other Contracting
Parties”; and

(d) Article 13 ECT, which establishes the requirements of a lawful
expropriation by a Contracting Party of “Investments of Investors of a

Contracting Party in the Area of any other Contracting Party”.

The purpose of the ECT is expressly set out under Article 2 ECT, which
provides as follows:
This Treaty establishes a legal framework in order to promote longterm

cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual
benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Charter.

The ECT does not contain a disconnect clause. Further, the Tribunal can
discern no attempt in the ECT’s provisions to carve out “intra-EU” investor-
State disputes from the protections afforded by the treaty.

It follows that the provisions of Article 26 ECT should be given their ordinary
meaning in accordance with Article 31 VCLT.

The Respondent does not contest that the Claimants are nationals of
Luxembourg, Denmark, and Italy. In the Tribunal’s opinion, the Claimants are

therefore Investors of “another” Contracting Party to the ECT for the purposes
of Article 26(1) ECT.

Likewise, the Tribunal has no doubt that the Respondent, being “a state...which
has consented to be bound by this Treaty and for which this Treaty is in force”,
falls within the definition of “Contracting Party” under Article 1(7)(a)(ii) ECT.'°°

Article 26(1) ECT requires that a dispute between a Contracting Party and an
Investor must relate to “an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former”.'4°
Article 1(10) ECT defines “Area” as “the territory under [a Contracting Party's]
sovereignty...”.'41 Again, the Tribunal considers that this requirement is clearly
met.

Following the textual approach to interpretation under Article 31 VCLT, the
Tribunal would therefore conclude that it has jurisdiction over the Parties’
dispute under the plain language of Article 26(1) ECT.

Further, the Tribunal considers that there is no need to resort to supplementary
means of interpretation under Article 32 VCLT. Indeed, there is nothing
ambiguous or obscure in Article 26(1) ECT, nor is the Tribunal’s conclusion
from the text that it has jurisdiction a manifestly absurd or unreasonable result.

For completeness, the Tribunal shall nevertheless briefly dispose of the
Respondent's submissions based on the “primacy” of EU law over allegedly
inconsistent provisions of the ECT.

The Respondent primarily relies on Article 25 ECT, which concerns Economic
Integration Agreements. Yet there is plainly nothing in the language of Article
25 ECT on the subject of the primacy of EU law. The Tribunal accordingly
rejects this submission.

Additionally, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal must apply applicable
rules of EU law pursuant to Article 26(6) ECT. The Respondent contends that
such applicable rules of EU law include a prohibition on ECT arbitration

C-1, ECT, Art. 1.
C-1, ECT, Art. 26.
C-1, ECT, Art. 1(10).

142
143,

between EU investors and an EU Member State. This prohibition allegedly
overrides the plain meaning of Article 26(1) ECT.

The Respondent also contends that there is a conflict between EU law and the
ECT because the Tribunal is being asked to rule upon a regulatory regime that
constitutes State aid under EU law. The Respondent places significant weight
on the EC State Aid Decision dated 10 November 2017.'*? The Respondent
contends inter alia that the EC State Aid Decision stands for the proposition
that any award by the Tribunal in this arbitration ordering the Respondent to
pay compensation would constitute State aid, which the Tribunal does not have
the competence to authorize as it falls within the exclusive competence of the
EC.

The Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent's submissions on the
“primacy” of EU law. Contrary to the Respondent’s contention, Article 26(6)
ECT applies to the merits of the case and not to jurisdiction. The Tribunal must
determine its jurisdiction exclusively in accordance with the jurisdictional
requirements of the ECT. As the Eiser v. Spain tribunal held:

The Tribunal's jurisdiction is derived from the express terms of the ECT, a
binding treaty under international law. The Tribunal is not an institution of the
European legal order, and it is not subject to the requirements of this legal
order.'48

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that EU law is not relevant to the question of

the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and the Respondent's jurisdictional objection based
on the “primacy” of EU law must be rejected.

As regards the Achmea Judgment, the Tribunal considers that it is irrelevant to
the Respondent's jurisdictional objection. The Tribunal agrees with the
following analysis of the Masdar tribunal:

679. The Achmea Judgment is of limited application — first, and specifically, to
the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investment
between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federal
Republic and, second, in a more general perspective, to any “provision in an
international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8
of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection between the
Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic.”
The ECT is not such a treaty. Thus, the Achmea Judgment does not take into

RL-97, EC State Aid Decision.
CL-170, Eiser, § 199.

51

221.

consideration, and thus it cannot be applied to, multilateral treaties, such as
the ECT, to which the EU itself is a party.

680. The conclusion of the Tribunal is in line with the Opinion of Advocate
General Wathelet delivered on 19 September 2017 in Achmea. [...]

681. With specific reference to the ECT, the Advocate General made the
following statement:

“That multilateral treaty on investment in the field of energy [the ECT]
operates even between Member States, since it was concluded not as
an agreement between the Union and its Member States, of the one
part, and third countries, of the other part, but as an ordinary
multilateral treaty in which all the Contracting Parties participate on an
equal footing. In that sense, the material provisions for the
protection of investments provided for in that Treaty and the ISDS
mechanism also operate between Member States. | note that if no
EU institution and no Member State sought an opinion from the
Court on the compatibility of that treaty with the EU and FEU
Treaties, that is because none of them had the slightest suspicion
that it might be incompatible.” (Emphasis added)

682. Had the CJEU seen it necessary to address the distinction drawn by the
Advocate General between the ISDS provisions of the ECT and the investment
protection mechanisms to be found in bilateral investment treaties made
between Member States within the ambit of its ruling, it had the opportunity to
do so. In fact, the Tribunal notes that the CJEU did not address this part of the
Advocate General's Opinion, much less depart from, or reject, it. The Achmea
Judgment is simply silent on the subject of the ECT. The Tribunal respectfully
adopts the Advocate General's reasoning on this matter, and it relies in
particular upon the observation in the final sentence cited above from his
Opinion.'44

Finally, the Tribunal observes that it is not aware of a single award that has
found “intra-EU” disputes to be excluded from the scope of Article 26(1) ECT.
By contrast, the Claimants led the Tribunal to eighteen awards in which
jurisdiction over intra-EU investment treaty disputes has been upheld." Since

the Hearing, at least two more published awards (Novenergia v. Spain and
Masdar v. Spain) have reached the same conclusion.'** As the foregoing
discussion has demonstrated, the Tribunal finds no reason to depart from these
awards, in particular those arising from cases involving similar or identical

issues.
Accordingly, the Respondent's first jurisdictional objection is dismissed.
B. Second Objection: The TVPEE Claim

In this arbitration, one of the Claimants’ claims is that the Respondent breached
Article 10(1) ECT when it introduced a 7% tax on the value of the production of
electrical energy (TVPEE) under Law 15/2012. The Respondent objects that it
has not consented to submit to arbitration any claims under Article 10(1) ECT
relating to “Taxation Measures’, pursuant to the carve-out in Article 21(1) ECT.

Consequently, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal does not have
jurisdiction to hear the Claimants’ claim that the introduction of the TVPEE is a
breach of Article 10(1) ECT. However, the Respondent does not contest
jurisdiction in respect of the Claimants’ separate claim that the TVPEE violated
Article 13 ECT on expropriation, as Article 13 ECT is expressly exempt from
the carve-out.

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. Respondent’s Position
(i) Overview

The Respondent submits that Article 21 ECT contains a general exclusion of
taxation measures from the scope of application of the ECT, and that none of
the claw-backs under Article 21(2) to (5) ECT are applicable. Accordingly, the
Respondent contends that the Tribunal is barred from hearing the claim that
Spain breached its obligations under Article 10(1) ECT through the introduction
of the TVPEE, which is a bona fide “Taxation Measure” for the purposes of
Article 21 ECT.

(ii) — Article 21 ECT

The Respondent contends that there is no doubt that the TVPEE is a “tax[] of
the domestic law of the Contract Party” and therefore meets the definition of
“Taxation Measure” in Article 21(7)(a)(i) ECT.

Specifically, the Respondent submits that Law 15/2012 is a national law of the
Kingdom of Spain, approved by the Spanish Parliament pursuant to its
Constitutional authority to impose taxes through law and in accordance with the
ordinary legislative procedure under Spanish law.

In determining this point, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal should
have regard to the pronouncements of Spain's courts and domestic bodies, '*”
as well as decisions at the international level pursuant to Article 26(6) ECT. The
Respondent contends that these decisions demonstrate that the TVPEE is a
tax both as a matter of domestic law and also under international law.'®

Further, as a matter of international investment law, the Respondent contends
that a tax has the following characteristics: (i) the tax is established by law; (ii)
the law imposes an obligation on a class of people; (iii) such obligation implies
paying money to the state; and (iv) the tax is for public purposes.'*° The
Respondent contends that these defining characteristics are met by the
TVPEE. In particular, the Respondent contends that the TVPEE is established
by Law 15/2012, which imposes an obligation on all persons who produce and
incorporate electricity (both conventional and renewable) into the SES, and the
revenue raised from the TVPEE is included in the General State Budgets for
the financing of public expenditure."

(iii) Bona fide taxation measure

230. The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ contention that the TVPEE is not a
“bona fide” taxation measure and is therefore outside of the scope of
Article 21 ECT.

231. The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ reliance on Yukos v Russian
Federation is misplaced. The Respondent contends that the tribunal's finding
in Yukos that the carve-out under Article 21(1) ECT applied only to bona fide
taxes was limited to the “extraordinary circumstances” of that case, where the
purpose of the taxation measure was “entirely unrelated” to the purpose of
raising general revenue for the State, namely “the destruction of a company or
the elimination of a political opponent”."5' The Respondent contends that such
extraordinary circumstances are clearly not present in this case.

232. The Respondent contends that an economic analysis of the taxation measure
is unnecessary. The Respondent relies on EnCana v Ecuador, where the
tribunal stated:

The question whether something is a tax measure is primarily a question of its
legal operation, not its economic effect.[...] The economic impacts or effects of
tax measures may be unclear and debatable; nonetheless a measure is a
taxation measure if it is part of the regime for the imposition of a tax. 5

233. In any event, the Respondent contends that such an analysis reveals the
TVPEE to be a bona fide taxation measure that was not designed to reduce the
tariffs paid to renewable plants.

234. The Respondent also contends that the Claimants consider the TVPEE to be a
bona fide tax, as demonstrated by the fact the Claimants have referred the
issue of whether or not the TVPEE is expropriatory to the competent Spanish
tax authority pursuant to Article 21(5)(b)(i) ECT."

235. Finally, the Respondent refers to the awards in /so/ux and Eiser, in which both
tribunals declared that they lacked jurisdiction to hear claims for breach of
Article 10(1) ECT arising out of introduction of the TVPEE.'®*

b. Claimants’ Position
(i) Overview

The Claimants submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over this claim because
the TVPEE is not a “Taxation Measure” for the purposes of the carve-out in
Article 21 ECT. In particular, the Claimants contend that the TVPEE is not a
bona fide tax of general application but is in fact unfair, arbitrary and a disguised
reduction to the tariffs that the Respondent promised to investors in renewable
electricity facilities.

Accordingly, the Claimants contend that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to
determine whether or not the TVPEE breached Article 10(1) ECT.

(ii) Article 21 ECT

The Claimants contend that Article 21 ECT does not exclude the application of
Article 10 ECT to the TVPEE because the TVPEE is not a “bona fide tax”.

The Claimants rely inter alia on the award in Yukos v. Russian Federation,
where the tribunal held that:

[T]he carve-out of Article 21(1) can apply only to bona fide taxation actions,
i.e., actions that are motivated by the purpose of raising general revenue for
the State. By contrast, actions that are taken only under the guise of taxation,
but in reality aim to achieve an entirely unrelated purpose...cannot qualify for
the exemption from the protection standards of the ECT under the taxation
carve-out in Article 21(1).155

[el

Since the claw-back in Article 21(5) of the ECT relates only to expropriations
under Article 13 of the ECT, a State could, simply by labelling a measure as
“taxation”, effectively avoid the control of that measure under the ECT’s other
protection standards. It would seem difficult to reconcile such an interpretation
with the purpose of Part III of the ECT.1¢

In the absence of a definition of “taxes” in the ECT, the Claimants contend that
the Tribunal must “look behind the label” in order to determine whether a

purported tax falls within the scope of Article 21 ECT.

In this regard, the Claimants contend that the measure’s status as a tax under
domestic law is not dispositive. Still, the Claimants question the conformity of

CL-70, Yukos Universal Ltd. V. Russian Federation, Final Award, July 18, 2014, § 1407.
Id., 1433.

56

the TVPEE with Spanish law. Specifically, the Claimants contend that Spain’s
Supreme Court has raised doubts regarding the constitutionality of the measure
and has referred the question of its compatibility with EU law to the CJEU.'5”
The Claimants further contend that regulations and declarations of fiscal
authorities relied on by the Respondent have no bearing on the lawfulness of
the measure. The Claimants submit that the validity of the TVPEE under
Spanish law therefore remains unsettled.

242. In any event, the Claimants contend that whether or not the TVPEE is
considered to be a valid tax as a matter of Spanish law is not determinative of
this point. The Claimants rely on several awards in which tribunals have
developed legal tests to help determine whether a measure qualifying as a tax
under domestic law is a “tax” for the purposes of an investment treaty. 1°

(iii) Bona fide tax measure

243. The Claimants cite Walde and Kolo that a purported tax “can constitute a
‘velvet’ revocation of contractually conceded investment incentives, and it can
be escalated up to the level of what is the economic equivalence of a direct
expropriation.”"9

244. The Claimants submit the TVPEE does not have the characteristics of a bona
fide tax. In order to assess whether or not a measure is a bona fide tax, the
Claimants contend that the Tribunal should focus on three issues:'® (i) is it
imposed by law?; (ii) is it imposed on broad classes of persons?; and (iii) does
it raise money for the State treasury to be used for public purposes?

245. Although the TVPEE is imposed by law, the Claimants contend that the
measure does not satisfy the other two requirements because: (i) it applies to
revenues including incentive tariffs, rather than profits or the wholesale value
of electricity generation, and therefore applies disproportionately to incentive
revenues that only renewable producers received (i.e. renewable facilities paid

a higher “tax” on the same amount of electricity production than conventional
electricity facilities); and (ii) it does not raise general revenue for the State but
is syphoned into the electricity system in order to reduce the regulated tariffs
that electricity consumers pay into the system to cover costs such as the tariffs.

The Claimants seek to distinguish the awards in /solux, Eiser and Masdar on
the grounds that they focused on Spain’s alleged bad faith intent, whereas the
Claimants submit that the proper test is the legal and economic effect of the
measure, which is not taxation but a reduction of incentives so that electricity
consumers will not have to pay for them.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal upholds the Respondent's jurisdictional objection that the Tribunal
does not have jurisdiction to hear the Claimants’ claim that the introduction of
the TVPEE in Law 15/2012 amounted to a breach of Article 10(1) ECT.

The Tribunal reaches this conclusion on the basis of the unambiguous
language of Article 21 ECT, which like many investment treaties contains an
express general “carve-out” of taxation measures from the application of the
ECT’s protections for investors.

The relevant provision is Article 21(1) ECT, which provides that:

Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall create
tights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the
Contracting Parties. In the event of any inconsistency between this Article and
any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the
inconsistency.'®"

This general exclusion, or carve-out, under Article 21(1) ECT is subject to the
following claw-backs under Article 21(2) to (5) ECT:

(2) Article 7(3) shall apply to Taxation Measures other than those on income
or on capital, except that such provision shall not apply to: [...]

(3) Article 10 (2) and (7) shall apply to Taxation Measures of the Contracting
Parties other than those on income or on capital, except that such provisions
shall not apply to: [...]

(4) Article 29(2) to (8) shall apply to Taxation Measures other than those on
income or on capital.

(5) (a) Article 13 shall apply to taxes. [...]

None of these claw-backs are relevant to this jurisdictional objection, a point
not contested by the Parties. (Pursuant to the exception at Article 21(5) ECT,
the Parties agree that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the claim that
Law 15/2012 violated Article 13 ECT on expropriation.)

This jurisdictional objection therefore turns on the meaning of the term
“Taxation Measure”, which is defined under Article 21(7)(a) ECT as:

(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party
or of a political subdivision thereof or a local authority therein; and

(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of double
taxation or of any other international agreement or arrangement by which the
Contracting Party is bound.

The ECT does not define the term “taxes” itself.

The Claimants do not contest that the ECT limits certain claims relating to
“Taxation Measures”. Rather, the Claimants’ case essentially is that the
TVPEE does not fall within the definition of “Taxation Measure” because it is
not really a tax at all, but a disguised reduction in the FiTs that the Claimants’
PV facilities were eligible to receive under RD 661/2007.

The Parties broadly agreed that, in looking “behind the label” to assess whether
or not a taxation measure is truly what it says it is, the Tribunal should consider
whether the measure: (i) is imposed by law; (ii) imposes an obligation on a
broad class of persons; and (iii) entails the payment of money to the State for
public purposes.

The Tribunal finds that these characteristics are present in this case. In
particular, the Spanish Constitutional Court confirmed in its judgment of
6 November 2014 that the TVPEE is a tax and is in conformity with the Spanish
Constitution.! The Tribunal observes that the lower Spanish courts and the
Spanish General Directorate of Taxes have all treated the TVPEE as a valid
tax under Spanish law.'®? The Tribunal also has regard to the decision of the

R-18, Judgment of the Constitutional Court, 183/2014, 6 November 2014.

R-9, Judgment of the Spanish National Court, 2 June 2014; R-10, Judgment of the National Court,

257. In seeking to distinguish this case from /Isolux, Eiser and Masdar, where
tribunals found they had no jurisdiction over Article 10(1) ECT claims
concerning the TVPEE, the Claimants suggest that the Tribunal should not
analyze the Respondent's subjective intent but its legal and economic effect.'®

258. However, the Tribunal has already found that the TVPEE is a tax as a matter
of both Spanish and EU law. Further, the Tribunal agrees with the finding in
the award in EnCana v. Ecuador that the economic analysis of a measure
should not displace a finding that a measure is a tax as a matter of law.'®

259. Moreover, the Tribunal observes that the Claimants’ argument that the
Article 21(1) ECT carve-out can only apply to bona fide taxation measures is
founded primarily on the award in Yukos Universal v. Russian Federation,
which was itself premised on the factual finding that Russia had sought to
destroy the Yukos oil company for political reasons. Even if the Tribunal were
to interpret Article 21(1) ECT as applying only to “bona fide” tax measures
(which the Tribunal does not decide), the Claimants have not proven such bad
faith on the part of the Respondent.

260. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the TVPEE is a “Taxation Measure” for
the purposes of Article 21(1) ECT. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not have
jurisdiction over the Claimants’ claim that the introduction of the TVPEE in
Law 15/2012 amounted to a breach of Article 10(1) ECT.

Vil. LIABILITY
A. Overview

261. The Claimants contend that the Respondent violated Article 10(1) ECT —
specifically: (i) the fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) standard, (ii) the non-
impairment standard, and (iii) the requirement to observe obligations entered
into with an Investor (the so-called “umbrella clause”) — and Article 13 ECT

concerning unlawful expropriation and measures having equivalent effect,

when it enacted the disputed measures.

On the basis of the Parties’ respective submissions, the Tribunal considers that

the issues to be decided on liability are as follows:

(a)

Fair and equitable treatment (Article 10(1) ECT):

Factually, did Spain incentivize the Claimants to invest when it
enacted the tariff regime under RD 661/2007?

Did the Claimants have legitimate expectations that the tariff
regime under RD 661/2007 would not change?

Did Spain subsequently abrogate the RD 661/2007 regime? If

so, was this:
(1) a breach of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations?
(2) a failure to treat the Claimants’ investments

transparently and consistently?

(3) a failure to act in good faith towards the Claimants’
investments?

Impairment: Whether Spain impaired the Claimants’ investments

through unreasonable or discriminatory measures, in violation of the

non-impairment standard under Article 10(1) ECT?

Umbrella clause: Whether the Respondent violated the ECT’s umbrella

clause under Article 10(1) ECT when it retroactively amended and then
abrogated the RD 661/2007 tariff regime?

Expropriation: Whether the Claimants’ investments were unlawfully

expropriated under Article 13 ECT as a result of the changes to the

regulatory framework after RD 661/2007?

The Tribunal has had the benefit of a full exchange of written pleadings and

submissions addressing each of these issues. For the avoidance of doubt, even

if not specifically mentioned in the summary of the Parties’ submissions in the

following sections of the Award, all of the Parties’ submissions and arguments

have been carefully considered by the Tribunal in reaching its decisions.

B. Applicable Law
The Tribunal is bound to decide the merits of this dispute in accordance with:

(a) Article 22(1) of the Rules of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm
Chamber of Commerce in force since 1 January 2010 (the “Rules”),
which provides that the Arbitral Tribunal “shall decide the merits of the
dispute on the basis of the law(s) or rules of law agreed upon by the
parties”; and

(b) Article 26(6) ECT, which provides that: “The Tribunal shall decide the
issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules
and principles of International Law.”

c. Fair and Equitable Treatment under Article 10(1) ECT

The fair and equitable treatment (FET) obligation is contained in
Article 10(1) ECT, which provides in full that:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty,
encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions
for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such
conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of
Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such
Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no
Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory
measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no
case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that
required by international law, including treaty obligations. Each Contracting
Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an
Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.

The Claimants contend that:

Spain violated its duty of fair and equitable treatment in at least three distinct
ways: 1) by violating Claimants’ legitimate expectation of fixed tariffs for all the
electricity produced by their photovoltaic facilities for the lives of those facilities;
2) by failing to treat Claimants’ investments transparently and consistently; and
3) by failing to act in good faith towards Claimants’ investments. 167

Further to the Tribunal’s directions to the Parties at the conclusion of the
Hearing,'®® the Tribunal has distilled the Parties’ submissions on the FET claim
into four issues:

a) Factually, did Spain incentivize the Claimants to invest when it enacted
the tariff regime under RD 661/2007?

(b) Did the Claimants have legitimate expectations that the tariff regime
under RD 661/2007 would not change?

(c) Did Spain subsequently abrogate the regime?

(d) If so, was this:
(i) a breach of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations?;
(ii) a failure to treat the Claimants’ investments transparently and

consistently?; and/or
(iii) a failure to act in good faith towards the Claimants’ investments?

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. Claimants’ Position

(i) Factually, did Spain incentivize the Claimants to invest when it
enacted the tariff regime under RD 661/2007?

The Claimants contend that Spain:

exercised its regulatory power to incentivize renewable energy investments by
granting fixed tariffs and deliberately relinquishing its discretion to reduce those
tariffs for existing (already built) plants, because Spain needed and wanted to
induce massive investment in its renewable energy sector. '®°

In particular, the Claimants contend that they were incentivized to invest by the
explicit terms of RD 661/2007 and by certain roadshows, statements and
promises of high-ranking Spanish representatives reinforcing that
RD 661/2007 offered stability and an attractive and predictable level of
profitability for renewable energy investors.

The Claimants contend that RD 661/2007 expressly established fixed FiTs
(indexed to inflation) that would be paid for the lifetime of a PV plant,
established priority of access and dispatch to the grid, and, crucially,
guaranteed that Spain would not in future alter the benefits for an existing
(already built) PV facility properly registered under RD 661/2007.'7° FiTs would
be reviewed four years after enactment, but any future revisions would not
affect the FiTs guaranteed to existing PV facilities already in operation.

The legal framework for the RD 661/2007 support scheme was provided by
Law 54/1997, which aimed to reduce electricity costs through market
mechanisms and instructed the regulator to set above-market FiTs in order to
meet Spain’s renewable energy targets, taking into account many different
factors. These factors included a “reasonable rate of return”, which the
Claimants contend was neither intended to be a cap nor a target for
incentives.'”'

The Claimants contend that the incentives in RD 661/2007 were necessary for
Spain to attract sufficient investment to meet its ambitious EU and international
environmental targets for renewable energy production. By contrast, the
support schemes enacted by Spain in 1998 (RD 2818/1998) and 2004
(RD 436/2004) had failed to attract sufficient investment for Spain to meet its
targets because they had not offered fixed or stable FiTs. Spain finally “got it
right” when it enacted RD 661/2007.'72

The Claimants contend that rational investors would not have constructed PV
facilities without government support because of the capital-intensive nature of
PV investments. Approximately 90% of the total installed costs of a PV facility
are upfront capital costs incurred in constructing the facility.'° In the case of
the Claimants’ PV facilities, that figure was 92%.'4 These costs are sunk upon
completion and will never decrease for the existing PV facility in question. By
contrast, operating costs are relatively low (approximately 8% of total installed
costs).'”° Moreover, the up-front cost of constructing PV facilities was higher
than the price of electricity, and the average cost of constructing a PV facility
decreased with technological advances over time, meaning that a rational
investor would always delay investing in the knowledge that a PV facility would
cost less to build in future.'”° Thus, the Claimants contend, stable and
predictable incentives were necessary in order to encourage investment in PV
facilities by mitigating the capital-intensive and high cost nature of such
investment.

The Claimants contend that Spain “very aggressively promoted the
transparency, stability and non-retroactivity” of the RD 661/2007 support
scheme.'’” The Claimants rely inter alia on the following:

(a) a press release accompanying RD 661/2007, in which Spain stated:

It will be in 2010 that the tariffs and premiums set out in the proposal
will be revised in accordance with the targets set in the Renewable
Energies Plan 2005-2010 and in the Energy Efficiency and Savings
Strategy and in line with the new targets included in the following
Renewable Energies Plan for the period 2011-2020.

The revisions carried out in the future of the tariffs will not affect those
Installations already in operation. This guarantee provides legal safety
for the producer, affording stability to the sector and fostering its
development.

[1

Every 4 years the tariffs will be revised, bearing in mind compliance
with the targets set. This will allow an adjustment to the tariffs in line
with the new costs and the degree of compliance with the targets. The
tariff revisions carried out in the future will not affect those installations
already operating. This guarantee affords legal safety to the producer,
providing stability to the sector and promoting its development.'78

(b) assurances of “legal security” and “stable remuneration” by senior
Spanish officials;"7°

(c) CNE presentations promoting Article 44.3 RD 661/2007 as a guarantee
that FiTs would not be retroactively changed for existing facilities;1®°

(d) CNE, IDAE and INVEST IN SPAIN “roadshows” held to promote
RD 661/2007 across the globe, in which returns of “between 8 and 11%”
and “sometimes even up to 20%” were touted; '®"

The Claimants also rely on the finding of the ECT tribunal in Novenergia v.
Spain, which concerned the same measures as in the present case, that Spain
made “a number of relevant statements or assurances” that “were indeed
aimed at incentivizing companies to invest heavily in the Spanish electricity
sector”, and “[a] considerable number of RE companies...invested in reliance
on these statements and assurances.”'®

In sum, the Claimants contend that they were offered an extraordinary degree
of security through the combination of: (i) a perfectly known price (since the FiT
was fixed) and (ii) inflation-indexed adjustments, together with (iii) the
guarantee of continued support throughout the entire life of each PV facility,
and (iv) the guarantee of no retroactive effect of future revisions.

Further, with the comfort of fixed, long-term FiTs — which comprised 80-90% of
a PV facility's revenue — the Claimants were able to secure financing for their
investments. The Claimants contend that they conducted due diligence and
were advised by prominent counsel and experts with no caveats that they were
eligible for the fixed FiTs under RD 661/2007.1®

The Claimants contend that, in reliance on the guarantees in RD 661/2007, as
well as the representations of Spanish officials, they acquired and developed
three PV projects: Madridejos (acquired by Foresight | in May 2009), La
Castilleja (acquired by Foresight 2 and GWM in March 2010), and
Fotocampillos (acquired by GWM II in May 2010; contributed to Greentech in
August 2011). All three were registered in the Administrative Registry for
Special Regime Generation Facilities (RAIPRE) (see paragraph 88 above), at
which point the Claimants contend that the right to receive the FiTs stipulated
in RD 661/2007 vested. The Claimants’ PV facilities initially received the
RD 661/2007 FiTs.

More generally, the Claimants contend that RD 661/2007 was a great success
and resulted in approximately €18 billion being invested into Spain’s renewable
energy sector between 2007 and 2009,'* thereby transforming Spain's PV
sector into a global leader. Spain subsequently enacted a similar, albeit scaled
back, FiT support scheme under RD 1578/2008.

(ii) Did the Claimants have legitimate expectations that the tariff
regime under RD 661/2007 would not change?

The Claimants submit that the protection of legitimate expectations is a well-
established component of the FET standard."®>

The Claimants contend that their legitimate expectations that they would
receive the precise FiTs specified in RD 661/2007 over the lifetime of their PV
facilities are based primarily on the unequivocal terms of RD 661/2007,
specifically:

(a) The right to receive incentives “for the total of partial sale of the net
electricity generated” pursuant to Article 17;

(b) The right to fixed incentives pursuant to Article 36, as follows:

PV facilities under 100 kW - Fixed FiTs of 44.0381 c€ per kWh of
electricity produced for the first 25 years of the facilities’ operation (and
fixed tariffs of 35.2305 c€ per kWh of electricity produced for the
remaining life of the facilities);

PV facilities between 100 kW and 10 MW - Fixed FiTs of 41.75 c€ per
kWh of electricity produced for the first 25 years of the facilities’
operation (and fixed tariffs of 33.4 c€ per kWh of electricity produced
for the remaining life of the facilities).

(c) The right to have those FiTs updated “on an annual basis using as a

reference the increase in the CPI” pursuant to Article 44.1;

(d) The guarantee against any other revisions to the FiTs granted to
existing plants pursuant to Article 44.3, which provides:
The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits

[under the premium option] indicated in this section shall not affect
facilities for which the deed of commissioning shall have been granted

prior to January 1 of the second year following the year in which the
revision shall have been performed.

Further, the Claimants contend that their legitimate expectations that the tariff
regime under RD 661/2007 would not change are also based on: (i) the fact
that, under Spanish law, registration in the RAIPRE “transformed
RD 661/2007’s offering of incentives to a specific, identifiable class of investors
into an individual (plant-specific) right to a certain incentive tariff recognized by
Spain”; ‘8° (ii) the context in which Spain enacted RD 661/2007, which
established a clear, straightforward and stable legal framework to incentivize
renewable investment after earlier support schemes had failed; (iii) roadshows,
statements and promises of high-ranking Spanish representatives and offices,
including by the Council of Ministers in its announcement accompanying
RD 661/2007; (iv) advice from Spanish lawyers; and (v) the fact that
international banks were willing to provide financing on favourable terms based
on predictable cash flows under the RD 661/2007 regime.'®”

The Claimants submit that their legitimate expectations are supported by the
findings of the Novenergia v. Spain tribunal, which found that, “RD 661/2007
was so adamantly clear that its understanding by common readers did not
require a particularly sophisticated analysis’, and that the 2005 PER,
RD 661/2007, RD 436/2004 and Spanish Supreme Court cases could not
have:

given the Claimant the expectation that a ‘reasonable rate of return’ would be

limited to 7%, that stability and predictability could not be expected in the SES,

that the Special Regime could be abolished, or any of the other arguments that
the Respondent appears to make.'8°

Applying the approach of the Novenergia tribunal, the Claimants contend that
the date of investment for the purposes of the ECT is 8 May 2009, when the
first of the Claimants’ investments was made by Foresight.'®° However, the
Claimants contend that the majority of the Respondent’s evidence purportedly
demonstrating that the Claimants should have expected changes to the
RD 661/2007 incentives in fact post-dates the Claimants’ investments. For
example, only seven of the hundreds of Spanish Supreme Court decisions
between 2005 and 2012 relied on by the Respondent were rendered before the

Claimants made their investments between 8 May 2009 and 7 May 2010,'°°
and none of those cases involved the RD 661/2007 support scheme, nor
considered the effect of a clause precluding future changes to incentive rates
for existing PV facilities (such as that in Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007).'"' In
sum, the Claimants contend that there was no indication at the time the
investments were made that the Respondent would or could reduce incentives
for existing PV facilities.

Moreover, the Claimants contend that, at the time they made their investment,
neither the Respondent nor the EC asserted that payment of FiTs under
RD 661/2007 constituted State aid under EU law. The Claimants submit that
the EC State Aid Decision dated 11 November 2017 relied on by the
Respondent — concerning the lawfulness of the New Regulatory Regime under
EU State aid law — does not assess the RD 661/2007 support scheme and is
therefore irrelevant to the question of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations. '°*

(iii) Did Spain subsequently abrogate the RD 661/2007 regime?

The Claimants contend that Spain, having met its renewable energy targets for
2010, subsequently reneged on the guarantees of stability and non-retroactivity
under RD 661/2007 and began cutting the incentives granted to existing PV
facilities, including the Claimants’ three facilities.

In particular, the Claimants contend that:

(a) In November 2010, Spain reduced the duration of the RD 661/2007 FiTs
from the lifetime of the PV facility to 25 years (RD 1565/2010,
subsequently extended to 28 years by RDL 14/2010 and to 30 years by
Law 2/2011);

(b) In December 2010, Spain reduced the effective FiT rates for the
Claimants’ PV facilities by 24% in 2011-2012 through the introduction
of an “emergency” operating hour cap on PV production,"®? and also
imposed a 0.5€/MWh “access toll” on all electricity delivered to the grid
(RDL 14/2010).

(c) In December 2012, Spain introduced a 7% “tax” on the production of
electricity (Law 15/2012).

(d) In February 2013, Spain amended the inflation index used to annually
update FiTs under RD 661/2007 (RDL 2/2013).

(e) Finally, between July 2013 and June 2014, Spain enacted the New
Regulatory Regime, which abolished the fixed FiT support schemes
under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 and replaced them with far less
valuable incentives under a result-orientated regime that engineered
remuneration to achieve a “reasonable rate of return” for a “standard
facility’ initially set at the ten-year average of Spanish Government bond
yields plus 3% (7.938% pre-tax).

The Claimants further contend that the New Regulatory Regime implemented
major structural changes in comparison to RD 661/2007, including: (i) the
change from a “regulated return” to an “at risk” regulatory framework; 1%
(ii) stricter targets to earn the target rate of return, in particular an increase in
operating hours and electricity production that a PV facility must achieve to
obtain the target return;'® (iii) the change in the FiT incentive structure from a
production payment (a fixed €/MWh FIT, with no limit on production) to a
payment based mainly on plant capacity, and the introduction of a cap on
production incentives at the maximum operating hours; (iv) reduction in the
reasonable return on investments by setting it at 7.398% pre-tax for 2013-2018
(5.9% after-tax, compared with 7%-9.5% after-tax under RD 661/2007); '®”
(v) introduction of a mechanism to retroactively “clawback” profits earned prior
to the New Regulatory Regime by reducing remuneration earned in 2013-2018,
so as to ensure PV facilities earn a return around the new 7.398% pre-tax target
over their entire regulatory lives;'®* (vi) cut the duration that incentives would
be paid from the lifetime of a PV facility to 30 years;'%° and (vii) changed the
allocation of interest rate risk.2°°

The Claimants contend that the Respondent’s decision to cut renewable
incentives, rather than set electricity prices at levels sufficient to cover total

electricity costs, was a political choice taken with full knowledge that Spain
would be liable to compensate investors. The Claimants cite an article in the
El Mundo newspaper dated 8 October 2014, which reported that:
...[T]he Government estimates that ... if all arbitrations are resolved against
Spain, the impact for the state would be €1.2 billion... In the [Energy Ministry]
they believe that this number is ‘minor’ if [it is] compared with the savings for

the electricity consumer due to the latest reforms on the remuneration of
renewable [energy] and cogeneration.2"

The Claimants contend that Spain’s abrupt regulatory about-face severely
harmed the Claimants’ investments. In particular, Spain’s measures:
(i) reduced the revenues and cash flows that had been promised under
RD 661/2007, thereby also shortening the economic life of the Claimants’
investments; (ii) increased working capital requirements; (iii) increased the risk
of default and insolvency; (iv) increased exposure to changes in market prices,
interest rates, and operating costs; and (v) increased regulatory risk.

The Claimants’ quantum expert calculates that the disputed measures reduced
the revenues of the Claimants’ PV facilities by approximately 23% (or €150
million) over their lifetimes.20

On 6 November 2015, Foresight 1's subsidiary,
Foresight Netherlands Solar 1B.V., sold the Madridejos project for €4.2
million, compared to the over €9 million it had originally paid to acquire
Madridejos.?°° As part of its mitigation strategy, in July 2016 Greentech
acquired Foresight 2’s 49.97% share of La Catilleja for €3.8 million, and has
thereby become sole owner of that project.2°* On 28 September 2016,
Greentech sold its equity the Fotocampillos project for €2.9 million.2°

(iv) Was there a breach of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations?

The Claimants submit that the Respondent violated their legitimate
expectations when it: imposed a limit on the annual operating hours for which
PV facilities could receive FiTs (RD 14/2010); further reduced the effective tariff
rate through the introduction of a 7% tax on the production of electricity (Law
15/2012) and by de-linking tariff adjustments from the CPI (RDL 2/2013), and

The Claimants submit that there is “a critical distinction to be made in this case
between existing, already built plants versus future PV plants”.°° The
Claimants recognize that Spain could always change the FiTs for new or future
PV facilities. However, the Claimants contend that Spain may not, without
breaching its obligations under the ECT, change FiTs for existing, already built
PV facilities.20”
The Claimants deny that the awards in Charanne v. Spain and Isolux v. Spain,
in which both tribunals found that investors did not have legitimate expectations
that Spain would not change the RD 661/2007 support scheme,?° are relevant
to the present case. The Claimants criticize and seek to distinguish the

Hr. Day 1, 6:

72

Charanne and Isolux awards on a number of grounds, including that Charanne
concerns only the 2010 measures and the claimant in /solux did not invest until
2012, after Spain had already enacted changes to RD 661/2007.

297. In the alternative, the Claimants submit that, even if they did not have a
legitimate expectation of stability regarding the precise FiTs in RD 661/2007,
Spain’s enactment of the New Regulatory Regime still violates the FET
standard because it is, to quote the tribunal in Eiser v. Spain, a “fundamental
change to the regulatory regime in a manner that does not take account of the
circumstances of existing investments made in reliance on the prior regime.”2°°
The Claimants also rely on the finding of the ECT tribunal in Novenergia v.
Spain that Spain violated the ECT by implementing the New Regulatory
Regime, which the Novenergia tribunal found “radically”, “unexpectedly”, and
“drastically” altered the RD 661/2007 support scheme, fell “outside the
acceptable range of legislative and regulatory behavior’, and “entirely
transformed and altered the legal and business environment under which the
investment was decided and made”.?!°

298. However, the Claimants contend that it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to apply
the “fundamental change” standard — or to engage in any balancing exercise
that seeks to evaluate whether or not Spain’s modifications to the regulatory
regime were appropriate — because there was, to quote Eiser, a “specific
assurance giving rise to a legitimate expectation of stability” in Article 44.3 of
RD 661/2007.2"'

(v) Was there a failure to treat the Claimants’ investments
transparently and consistently?

299. The Claimants contend that the Respondent also violated the FET standard by
failing to treat the Claimants’ investments transparently and consistently, which
the Claimants submit is a distinct component of the ECT’s FET clause.?'2

300. The Claimants submit that a State’s duty of transparency “requires both the
absence of any ambiguity or opacity in its treatment of investments, and that
the legal framework that will apply to an investment be readily apparent.”*!>

The Claimants contend that none of the changes enacted by the Respondent
subsequent to the Claimants’ investments can be traced to the legal framework
under which they invested.

Moreover, the Claimants contend that the New Regulatory Regime is plainly
inconsistent with the regime under which the Claimants invested. Indeed,
Spain repealed Law 54/1997, which provided the overarching legal framework
under which the RD 661/2007 support scheme operated, so that it could enact
the New Regulatory Regime.

In short, the Claimants contend, the Respondent “has made the investment
environment entirely uncertain and future remuneration impossible to
predict.”2"4

Further, the Claimants contend that the Respondent's pleaded case on
legitimate expectations — that RD 661/2007 did not mean what it plainly said
when it guaranteed specific FiTs for the life of a facility, that RD 661/2007 did
not mean what Spanish officials repeatedly said it said, and that RD 661/2007
did not mean what sophisticated investors and lenders believed it said — is
“essentially a damning confession on the subject of transparency (as well as

consistency and good faith)”.2"5

(vi) Was there a failure to act in good faith towards the Claimants’
investments?

The Claimants contend that the Respondent violated the FET standard by
failing to treat the Claimants’ investments in good faith, which the Claimants
submit is a distinct component of the ECT’s FET clause.?'®

The Claimants contend that the Respondent's conduct was not in good faith
because it: (i) cut the FiTs after reaping the benefit of new PV capacity and in
the knowledge that the majority of investors’ costs in PV facilities was sunk at
the time of investment; and (ii) used the Claimants and other renewable energy
investors as a “scapegoat’ for its tariff deficit.2””

b. Respondent’s Position

(i) Factually, did Spain incentivize the Claimants to invest when it
enacted the tariff regime under RD 661/2007?

The Respondent admits that RD 661/2007 was one of the incentives it offered
for renewable energy investors at the time the Claimants made their
investments.?'®

However, the Respondent contends that it never guaranteed that the
Claimants’ PV plants would receive a fixed FiT throughout their operating lives.
Rather, Article 30.4 RD 661/2007 guaranteed only a “reasonable rate of return”
assessed by reference to returns in the capital markets. The Respondent
accepts that the press release accompanying RD 661/2007 did state that future
revisions to the FiTs would not affect PV facilities that had already been
commissioned, but the Respondent contends that this statement concerned
revisions within the framework of Article 44 RD 661/2007.?"° As Mr Vaquer, the
Respondent's expert on Spanish law, stated at the Hearing, the press release
“doesn’t say a thing about the possibility of having [RD 661/2007] being
repealed afterwards. It only speaks about revisions carried out under that
particular royal decree.”?°

Further, the Respondent contends that RD 661/2007 did not offer more stability
than RD 436/2004 and was actually intended to correct windfall profits
generated under the RD 436/2004 support scheme, and to reverse the tariff
deficit so as to ensure the sustainability of the SES. Indeed, the Respondent
contends that RD 661/2007 actually reduced remuneration for all PV facilities
under 100kWh, which in 2009 were 99% of all PV facilities in Spain.?2"

Moreover, the Respondent contends that the fact that RD 661/2007 amended
the RD 436/2004 support scheme is fatal to the Claimants’ theory that they
were guaranteed fixed FiTs for the lifetime of their PV facilities. The
Respondent contends that this reflects the reality that the RD 436/2004 and
RD 661/2007 support schemes were merely regulations that could not as a
matter of Spanish law petrify the legal framework under Law 54/1997. The
Respondent also rejects the Claimants’ reliance on the supposed guarantee

under Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007. Rather, the Respondent contends that
Article 44.3 RD 661/2007 is very similar to Article 40.3 RD 436/2004, which did
not prevent the changes to FiTs and other aspects of the support scheme
subsequently introduced by RD 661/2007.

The Respondent also denies that it conducted an “aggressive campaign” to
attract foreign investment under RD 661/2007.

The Respondent contends that the Claimants misrepresent the alleged
assurances of Spanish officials. The Claimants knew — or would have known,
had they conducted proper due diligence of the strategically important and
highly regulated SES — that they were entitled only to a reasonable rate of
return under Law 54/1997, which provided the regulatory framework for the
RD 661/2007 support scheme. Further, the Claimants’ reliance on the
purported stabilization clause in Article 44.3 RD 661/2007 is completely
misplaced. No diligent investor could have believed that existing regulations
could never be adapted to changing economic circumstances or technical
developments. Indeed, prior to the enactment of RD 661/2007, there were a
number of regulatory changes to the renewable energy support schemes that
were introduced under Law 54/1997.

The Respondent also contends that the Claimants have not provided any
evidence supporting their claim that they acquired a right to the payment of
future FiTs in respect of all the energy their PV facilities might produce, for the
whole operating life of those PV facilities, without any possible limit.

(ii) Did the Claimants have legitimate expectations that the tariff
regime under RD 661/2007 would not change?

The Respondent submits that the Claimants did not have legitimate
expectations that the tariff regime under RD 661/2007 would not change during
the entire life of the PV facilities registered thereunder.

The Respondent contends that it did not make any specific commitment to the
Claimants, without which the Respondent submits there can be no legitimate
expectation that a general regulatory framework will remain unchanged.” The
Respondent submits that the Claimants’ position effectively requires the
regulatory framework to be “petrified” at the time an investment is made,

316.

317.

204

contrary to the position under Spanish law, EU State aid law, and the Parties’
rights and obligations under the ECT.

The Respondent contends that the Claimants never commissioned legal due
diligence on the specific issue of whether or not the tariff regime could be
changed, as admitted by Mr Jamie Richards, a partner of Foresight Group, at
the Hearing.2"° The Respondent contends that such legal due diligence would
have revealed that there was no basis for the Claimants to objectively and
reasonably expect the regulatory framework to be “petrified”. The Respondent
further contends that the Claimants’ expectations were not reasonable or
justified in light of the information regarding regulatory risk that the Claimants
knew, or should as a diligently informed investor have known, at the time of
their investments.

The Respondent contends that the following factors demonstrate that the
Claimants could not have had legitimate expectations that the tariff regime
would not change.

First, the Respondent contends that the evolution of the Spanish support
schemes demonstrated to the Claimants that the regulatory regime could be
changed. In particular, the Respondent relies on the fact that RD 436/2004
was modified by RD 661/2007 — notwithstanding Article 40.3 RD 436/2004,
which is similar to the supposed “guarantee” language in Article
44.3 RD 661/2007 relied on by the Claimants — as well as the Fifth Additional
Provision of RD 1578/2008, which expressly provided for revision to FiTs of
existing facilities in 2012.24

Second, the Respondent submits that it is significant to the issue of legitimate
expectations that the Claimants invested in a strategic and highly regulated
sector. In particular, the Respondent contends that any diligent investor would
have been aware that the Respondent was required to balance investor and
consumer interests pursuant to the legal and regulatory framework. The
Respondent refers to the preamble to RD 661/2007, which provides:

The economic framework established in the present Royal Decree develops
the principles provided in Law 54/1997, of 27 November, on the Electricity
Sector, guaranteeing the owners of facilities under the special regime a
reasonable return on their investments, and the consumers of electricity an

320.

assignment of the costs attributable to the electricity system which is also

reasonable, [...].225
The Respondent further explains that the SES is based on two basic principles:
sustainability and reasonable return. In accordance with the principle of
hierarchy under Spanish law, RD 661/2007 operated within the regulatory
framework established by Law 54/1997, which subordinates the payment of
renewable electricity subsidies to the need to ensure the financial sustainability
of the SES.7° The Respondent contends that since 2006 it has warned
investors that returns must be proportional to consumers’ bills. ?27 The
Respondent further contends that RD 661/2007, RD 1578/2008, CNE
Report 30/2008, RDL 6/2009, and Law 2/2011 all emphasized the need to
ensure the sustainability of the SES.7

Third, the Respondent contends that a reasonable investor would have known
that the incentives under RD 661/2007 could be amended as a matter of
Spanish law, as interpreted by the Spanish Supreme Court. 7° The
Respondent contends that the Supreme Court has confirmed in its judgments
that the Respondent's power to make regulatory changes to renewable
electricity support schemes is limited only to ensuring that investors have: (i) a
reasonable rate of return; (ii) priority of access to the grid; and (iii) priority of
dispatch to the grid.°°° The Respondent contends there is no material
difference in the jurisprudence dated prior to and after the Claimants’
investments.*' Moreover, before the Claimants invested the limits of the
Respondent's regulatory power under Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997 had been
clearly established in the Supreme Court's decision of 25 October 2006.7? The
Respondent relies inter alia on the decision of the Spanish Supreme Court
dated 9 December 2009 concerning a challenge to RD 661/2007, in which the
court stated:

[The claimant] does not pay enough attention to the case law of this Chamber

specifically referred to with regard to the principles of legitimate expectation

and non-retroactivity applied to the successive incentives’ regimes for
electricity generation. This involves the considerations set out in our decision

dated October 25, 2006 and repeated in that issued on March 20, 2007, inter
alia, about the legal situation of the owners of electrical energy production
installations under a special regime to whom it is not possible to acknowledge
for the future an "unmodifiable right " to the maintenance unchanged of the
remuneration framework approved by the holder of the regulatory authority
provided that the stipulations of the Law on the Electricity Sector are respected
in terms of the reasonable return on investments.83

Fourth, the Respondent contends that the payment of FiTs under RD 661/2007
was a subsidy intended only to create a level playing field between
conventional and renewable energy producers. The Claimants could not
therefore expect to receive a higher FiT than necessary to compensate for the
difference between the cost of producing renewable electricity and the market
price.

Fifth, the level of subsidy was set on the basis of assumptions and forecasts
regarding macroeconomic circumstances but was also subject to ensuring the
overall sustainability of the SES. The Claimants could not therefore have had
a legitimate expectation that FiTs would not change in the event a change of
macroeconomic circumstances impaired the sustainability of the SES.

Relatedly, the Respondent also relies on the EC State Aid Decision dated
11 November 2017, which concerns whether or not the New Regulatory
Regime that replaced RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 constituted unlawful
State aid under EU law.

The Respondent contends that the EC State Aid Decision stands for five
propositions. First, the RD 661/2007 support scheme constitutes State aid
under EU law, which requires that subsidies are constantly monitored in to
order to ensure that they are always proportionate from an economic
perspective to the State’s policy goal of promoting renewable energy. Second,
under EU law there is no right of an investor to State aid generally or to a
specific structure or level of support. Third, the RD 661/2007 support scheme
was not authorized by the European Commission, meaning that its lawfulness
under EU State aid rules was not determined. Fourth, the Claimants, as
recipients of State aid, could not have had legitimate expectations that the un-
notified State aid, i.e. RD 661/2007, was either lawful or would not be modified.
Fifth, the European Commission is the only authority with the competence to

326.

328.

234

decide the lawfulness of State aid; it follows that the Tribunal does not have the
competence to authorize the granting of State aid.?5+

Sixth, the Respondent relies on the fact that certain of the Claimants’ contracts
relating to the Claimants’ acquisitions of the PV facilities contain provisions
acknowledging the possibility of regulatory changes.?°>

(iii) Did Spain subsequently abrogate the RD 661/2007 regime?

The Respondent contends that it has not in fact abrogated the support scheme
for PV electricity producers, from either an economic or legal perspective. The
Respondent admits that the disputed measures have introduced some changes
but maintains that the essential nature of the renewables regime has remained
unchanged, specifically the granting of a subsidy, priority of market access and
dispatch, and a reasonable rate of return of 7.398% pre-tax (6.39% post-tax)
that was well above the market weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
(6.89% pre-tax*).257 There has been no negative impact on the Claimants’
investments as a result of the disputed measures.

The Respondent contends that fixed Fits were never guaranteed under
RD 661/2007 and it permissibly made changes to incentives in response to
changing circumstances. The economic situation in Spain by the time of the
Claimants’ investments in 2009-2010 was completely different from that which
had prevailed when RD 661/2007 was enacted. As a result of the financial
crisis, electricity demand fell to 2005 levels.7%® Whereas the Respondent had
intended the FiTs to yield a 7% rate of return,”°? investors in PV facilities ended
up receiving excessive remuneration resulting in a rate of return of more than
9%. This negatively impacted the economic sustainability of the SES.

In order to address this situation, the Respondent did two things. First, it
increased the access tariffs paid by Spanish electricity consumers to among

The Respondent also contends that any award by the Tribunal in this arbitration ordering the
Respondent to pay compensation would itself constitute State aid, and such an award would
therefore have to be authorized by the European Commission. Hr. Day 2, 127:4-21; Respondent's

the highest in Europe, representing an 81% increase between 2004 and
2011.41 Second, between 2010 and 2014, the Respondent enacted the
disputed measures to restore the economic sustainability of the SES.

From an economic perspective, the Respondent contends that the disputed
measures maintain the essence of the RD 661/2007 support scheme that the
Claimants invested under. In particular, the Respondent contends that the
Claimants have received up to 88% of their revenues from FiTs,”4? and have
received a reasonable rate of return of 8.6% pre-tax.*43 According to the
Respondent's primary valuation methodology, the Claimants have not suffered
any loss as a result of the disputed measures." The Claimants’ PV facilities
will generate enough cash-flows to recover investment costs, operating costs,
and to obtain a reasonable return that is above the benchmark market return
(WACC (6.89% pre-tax)*°) and the reasonable return established by the
Respondent (7.398% pre-tax“*), More generally, the Spanish PV sector has
received government subsidies in the amount of €64.2 billion.24”

From a legal perspective, the Respondent contends that the New Regulatory
Regime maintains the essential features of the RD 661/2007 support scheme
under which the Claimants invested, namely a reasonable rate of return with
reference to the cost of money in the capital markets, guarantee of priority of
access to grid and priority of dispatch, all in accordance with EU State aid law.

(iv) Was there a breach of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations?

The Respondent submits that, given the absence of a specific commitment of
stability, the Claimants did not at the time they made their investments have
legitimate expectations that RD 661/2007 would not be amended, nor did they
have legitimate expectations that their PV facilities would receive a guaranteed
fixed FiT throughout the plants’ operating lives. Accordingly, the Respondent
contends that there has been no breach of the Claimants’ legitimate
expectations.

The Respondent contends that the Eiser, Novenergia and Masdar cases
against Spain were wrongly decided.“ The Respondent submits that the
Tribunal should follow the Charanne and Isolux awards in finding that the
Claimants did not have legitimate expectations that their incentives would never
be changed and there was no violation of the FET standard.?4°

In any event, the Respondent contends that the disputed measures were
reasonable and proportionate, and are therefore non-compensable regulatory
measures.?° The measures were reasonable because they were inter alia
addressed to the rational policy of ensuring the economic sustainability of the
SES, which is the guiding principle of the regulatory framework. The SES had
become unsustainable because of: (i) a fall in energy demand as a result of the
financial crisis; (ii) an increase in tariffs paid by Spanish consumers, which were
amongst the highest in the EU; (iii) over-remuneration in the renewables sector
resulting in windfall profits; and (iv) an increasing tariff deficit. The Respondent
contends that the measures are proportionate because they reduced the
economic burden to consumers of delivering a sustainable electricity system
while renewable energy investors continued to have priority of access and
dispatch, and received a reasonable rate of return of approximately 7.398%
pre-tax. Moreover, the disputed measures were totally in accordance with EU
State aid law.

(v) Was there a failure to treat the Claimants’ investments
transparently and consistently?

The Respondent contends that it acted transparently and consistently as
regards the Claimants’ investments.

The Respondent submits that there cannot be a breach of the transparency
obligation when it was notorious that regulatory changes could be made, as
demonstrated by the evolution of the renewables support schemes enacted by
Spain and the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court.

In any event, the Respondent contends that the disputed measures followed
the established procedures and maintained the essential nature of the
regulatory framework under which the Claimants invested, in particular: a

subsidy, priority of market access and dispatch, and a reasonable rate of return
in accordance with the cost of money on the capital markets. The Respondent
denies that the contested measures were retroactive. In fact, the Respondent
contends, the disputed measures apply to future rights only, as provided in
RDL 9/2013.251

The Respondent submits that the duty of consistency does not require the
regulatory framework to be petrified or frozen absent a specific commitment to
an investor by the host State. The Respondent contends that the disputed
measures were consistent with the guiding principles of the regulatory
framework, namely sustainability and a reasonable rate of return.

(vi) Was there a failure to act in good faith towards the Claimants
investments?

The Respondent contends that it has acted in good faith at all times towards
the Claimants’ investments. Moreover, the Respondent contends that the fact
that the Claimants’ failed to conduct adequate due diligence so as to
understand the regulatory framework does not support a finding of bad faith on
the part of the Respondent.

Further, the Respondent contends that the disputed measures were adopted
in good faith and were non-discriminatory. The Respondent submits that the
disputed measures were ultimately the consequence of the severe economic
crisis in Europe from 2009-2014, including a resulting fall in energy demand,
and the need to correct the tariff deficit. The Respondent further contends that,
in accordance with the basic principles of sustainability and reasonable return,
it is not required to elevate the interests of foreign investors above other
considerations. In any event, the Claimants have in fact received a reasonable
rate of return.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

This case raises the important question of the circumstances in which a State
will be found to have violated its obligations under the ECT as a consequence
of the exercise by that State of its inherent right to regulate in the public interest.

The Tribunal’s first task is to determine the content of the FET obligation,
including the question of whether or not the duties of transparency/consistency
and good faith are stand-alone obligations under Article 10(1) ECT or form part
of the assessment of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations. The Tribunal shall
then apply that standard to the facts of this case.

(i) The FET Standard

The Tribunal turns first to the construction of the obligation to accord fair and
equitable treatment, which is set out under Article 10(1) ECT and provides in
relevant part as follows:
Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty,
encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions
for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such
conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of
Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment.
As any other treaty provision, the text of Article 10(1) ECT must be interpreted
in accordance with the normal canons of treaty interpretation contained in the
VCLT.

Article 31 VCLT, the primary rule of treaty interpretation, provides that “[a]
treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning
to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object
and purpose.” In limited circumstances, the Tribunal may if necessary have
regard to the supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 VCLT.

Accordingly, the Tribunal begins the interpretative exercise by considering the
ordinary meaning of the ECT’s terms, their context, and the object and purpose
of the ECT. Pursuant to Article 31(2) VCLT, “t[h]e context for the purpose of
the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise [...] the text, including its preamble

and annexes [...].”

The Tribunal must also interpret the text of the ECT in accordance with
Article 31(3)(c) VCLT, which requires that “[a]ny relevant rules of international
law applicable in the relations between the parties” shall be taken into account
together with the context.

Article 2 ECT states that the “Purpose of the Treaty” is as follows:

84

348.

349.

350.

351.

352.

This Treaty establishes a legal framework in order to promote longterm

cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual

benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Charter.
As regards the ECT’s object and purpose, the Claimants cite An Introduction
to the Energy Charter Treaty, which states that the ECT’s “fundamental aim” is
“to strengthen the rule of law on energy issues”.”°* Citing the preamble and
Article 2 ECT, the Claimants further submit that two overarching purposes of
the ECT are to “catalyze economic growth” through investment and trade and
in energy and to establish “a legal framework to promote long-term
cooperation” between States and investors.?°>

The Respondent submits that the “main objective” of the ECT is “to create an
efficient energy market based on the principle of non-discrimination and price
formation according to market rules.”** The Respondent contends that the
Claimants’ assertion of a right to a guaranteed fixed FiT — which the
Respondent considers to be tantamount to the assertion of a right to a specific
amount of State aid — is incompatible with the ECT’s objective of creating an
efficient market.255

The Tribunal agrees with the Eiser tribunal that the purpose of the ECT is to
ensure that national legal frameworks are “stable, transparent, and compliant
with international legal standards.”*5° Accordingly, the FET standard must be
interpreted in this context.

Indeed, the Tribunal considers that it is well established that legal stability is
part of the FET standard under the ECT.?°”

Further, the Tribunal considers that it is widely accepted that the protection of
an investor's legitimate expectations is one of the most important components
of the FET standard.?* The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that a State's

duty under the FET standard to ensure a stable legal and regulatory framework
“arises when the State has generated ‘legitimate expectations’ of such stability
‘on the part of investors”.?59

As the Micula v. Romania tribunal stated, in order for an investor to have such
a legitimate expectation:

There must be a promise, assurance or representation attributable to a
competent organ or representative of the state, which may be explicit or
implicit. The crucial point is whether the state, through statements or conduct,
has contributed to the creation of a reasonable expectation, in this case, a
representation of regulatory stability. It is irrelevant whether the state in fact
wished to commit itself; it is sufficient that it acted in a manner that would
reasonably be understood to create such an appearance. The element of
reasonableness cannot be separated from the promise, assurance or
representation, in particular if the promise is not contained in a contract or is
otherwise stated explicitly. Whether a state has created a legitimate
expectation in an investor is thus a factual assessment which must be
undertaken in consideration of all the surrounding circumstances.2©°

An investor’s expectations of legal stability must be reasonable and objective.
As the Plama Consortium v. Bulgaria tribunal held:

the ECT does not protect investors against any and all changes in the host
country's laws. Under the fair and equitable treatment standard the investor is
only protected if (at least) reasonable and justifiable expectations were created
in that regard.?5"

Likewise, the Charanne v. Spain tribunal held:

A finding that there has been a violation of investor's expectations must be
based on an objective standard or analysis, as the mere subjective belief that
could have had the investor at the moment of making of the investment is not
sufficient. Moreover, the application of the principle accordingly depends on
whether the expectation has been reasonable in the particular case with
relevance to representations possibly made by the host State to induce the
investment.262

It is also well-established that there are limits to the legal stability that an
investor can legitimately expect. In the absence of a specific commitment to
the investor by the host State, the investor cannot expect the legal or regulatory
framework to be frozen. In such circumstances, a host State has space to

reasonably modify the legal or regulatory framework without breaching an
investor's legitimate expectations of stability.

As the Micula v. Romania tribunal held:

[T]he fair and equitable treatment standard does not give a right to regulatory
stability per se. The state has a right to regulate, and investors must expect
that the legislation will change, absent a stabilization clause or other specific
assurance giving rise to a legitimate expectation of stability.26°

Similarly, the AES v. Hungary tribunal held:

The stable conditions that the ECT mentions relate to the framework within
which the investment takes place. Nevertheless, it is not a stability clause. A
legal framework is by definition subject to change as it adapts to new
circumstances day by day and a state has the sovereign right to exercise its
powers which include legislative acts. Therefore, to determine the scope of the
stable conditions that a state has to encourage and create is a complex task
given that it will always depend on the specific circumstances that surround the
investor's decision to invest and the measures taken by the state in the public
interest.264

However, the Tribunal agrees with the Eiser v. Spain and Novenergia v. Spain
tribunals that the FET standard in the ECT protects investors from a radical or
fundamental change in the legal or regulatory framework under which the
investments are made.?° As the Eiser tribunal stated:

Taking account of the context and of the ECT’s object and purpose, the
Tribunal concludes that Article 10(1)’s obligation to accord fair and equitable
treatment necessarily embraces an obligation to provide fundamental stability
in the essential characteristics of the legal regime relied upon by investors in
making long-term investments. This does not mean that regulatory regimes
cannot evolve. Surely they can... However, the Article 10(1) obligation to
accord fair and equitable treatment means that regulatory regimes cannot be
radically altered as applied to existing investments in ways that deprive
investors who invested in reliance on those regimes of their investment’s
value.?65

The next question for the Tribunal is whether the obligation of transparency and
consistency, and the obligation of good faith, are stand-alone obligations under
Article 10(1) ECT that should be determined separately, or whether they form
part of the obligation to respect the legitimate expectations of an investor.

As for the obligation of transparency and consistency, the Tribunal agrees with
the findings of the tribunals in Plama v. Bulgaria, Charanne v. Spain, Isolux v.

CL-20, Micula, | 666.

Spain, and Novenergia v. Spain that this is not an independent obligation.”°”
Rather, the obligation of transparency and consistency is “simply an illustration
of the obligation to respect the investor's legitimate expectations through the
FET standard.”

Likewise, the Tribunal considers that the obligation of good faith is a component
of legitimate expectations. Accordingly, the Tribunal shall consider the Parties’
submissions on good faith as part of its assessment of the Claimants’ legitimate
expectations.

Finally, this case raises the issue of Spain’s right to regulate in the public
interest. As the Philip Morris v. Uruguay tribunal held:

It is common ground in the decisions of more recent investment tribunals that
the requirements of legitimate expectations and legal stability as
manifestations of the FET standard do not affect the State’s rights to exercise
its sovereign authority to legislate and to adapt its legal system to changing
circumstances.6

However, as Eiser and the cases cited above demonstrate, the right to regulate
must be subject to limitations if investor protections are not to be rendered
meaningless. As the ADC v. Hungary tribunal held:

423. [...] while a sovereign State possesses the inherent right to regulate its
domestic affairs, the exercise of such right is not unlimited and must have its
boundaries. [...] [T]he rule of law, which includes treaty obligations, provides
such boundaries. Therefore, when a State enters into a bilateral investment
treaty like the one in this case, it becomes bound by it and the investment-
protection obligations it undertook therein must be honoured rather than be
ignored by a later argument of the State’s right to regulate.

424. The related point made by the Respondent that by investing in a host
State, the investor assumes the ‘risk’ associated with the State’s regulatory
regime is equally unacceptable to the Tribunal. It is one thing to say that an
investor shall conduct its business in compliance with the host State’s domestic
laws and regulations. It is quite another to imply that the investor must also be
ready to accept whatever the host State decides to do to it. In the present case,
had the Claimants ever envisaged the risk of any possible depriving measures,
the Tribunal believes that they took that risk with the legitimate and reasonable
expectation that they would receive fair treatment and just compensation and
not otherwise.?7°

(ii) Did the Claimants have legitimate expectations that the tariff
regime under RD 661/2007 would not change?

The Tribunal has decided that the Claimants did not have legitimate
expectations that they would receive the precise FiT specified in RD 661/2007
for the entire lifetime of their PV plants. However, the Tribunal, does find that
the Claimants had the legitimate expectation that the legal and regulatory
framework would not be fundamentally and abruptly altered, thereby depriving
investors of a significant part of their projected revenues.

The Claimants contend that Article 44.3 RD 661/2007 is a specific assurance
giving rise to a legitimate expectation that the Claimants would receive fixed
FiTs for the lifetime of their PV plants. The Tribunal is not persuaded. The
Tribunal agrees with the finding in Eiser that RD 661/2007 did not give investors
“immutable economic rights that could not be altered by changes in the
regulatory regime”.2”!

The Tribunal notes that the Masdar tribunal's finding of the existence of a
specific commitment is distinguishable because in that case the claimant
sought and received specific clarification from Spain that their facilities would
receive the RD 661/2007 FiTs throughout their operating lives.?”

The Tribunal considers that, in the absence of specific commitments
guaranteeing the immutability of the legal framework, it is difficult to assume
that a reasonable investor would not have expected any regulatory changes to
RD 661/2007 at all.

First, remuneration under the Special Regime had been regularly amended
prior to the enactment of RD 661/2007. Indeed, prior to the Claimants’ making
their investments, Spain had modified the regime when it enacted
RD 2818/1998, RD 436/2004, RD 661/2007 itself, and RD 1578/2008.

Second, again prior to the Claimants’ investments, the Spanish Supreme Court
had rejected challenges to these modifications and denied that investors had a

vested right to specific subsidies. For example, in December 2005, the
Supreme Court stated that:

There is no legal obstacle that exists to prevent the Government, in the
exercise of the regulatory powers and of the broad entitlements it has in a
strongly regulated issue such as electricity, from modifying a specific system
of remuneration [...] Producers do not have an unmodifiable right that the
economic scheme which regulates modifications to premiums will stay the
same. Said regime is not [a] guarantee to remain unaltered in the future.?”°

And in October 2006, the Supreme Court held that:

electricity producers under the special regime do have an "unalterable right" to
remain in an unchanged economic regime governing the collection of
premiums. The scheme is, in fact, to encourage the use of renewable energy
through an incentive mechanism, like all of this genre, and cannot be
guaranteed to remain unchanged in the future.”

In its judgment dated 3 December 2009 concerning the interpretation of Article

40.3 RD 436/2004 — a clause similar to Article 44.3 RD 661/2007 — the Spanish
Supreme Court held that:

Ultimately, it shall be considered that the claim that the Administration be
sentenced to update the tariffs for 2007, applying the updating methodology
resulting from Royal Decree 436/2004, or from Royal Decree 661/2007, must
be rejected, since the criterion of not raising the values of the regulated tariff
for photovoltaic technology installations is justified in that the profitability of the
generation activity from this technology was higher than that considered as
sufficient and reasonable remuneration.?75

This judgment was rendered after the Claimants’ investment in Madridejos, but
before their investments in La Castilleja and Fotocampillos.

After the 3 December 2009 judgment, the Majority of the Tribunal considers
that a diligent investor might have been in a position to foresee the possibility
of regulatory changes altering RD 661/2007.

As the Charanne tribunal held:

Although decisions of the Spanish courts are not binding on the Arbitral
Tribunal, they remain relevant as factual elements to verify that an investor
could not, at the time of the disputed investment, have the reasonable

378.

expectation that in the absence of a specific commitment the regulation would
not be modified throughout the life of the plants.276

The Tribunal also agrees with the Charanne tribunal that:

503. In this case, the Claimants could not have the legitimate expectation that
the regulatory framework laid down by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 would
remain unchanged during the entire lifespan of their plants. Accepting such an
expectation would, in fact, amount to freezing the regulatory framework
applicable to eligible plants, even though the circumstances may change [...]
The Arbitration Tribunal cannot accept such a conclusion.

504. The conclusion drawn by the Tribunal, i.e. that in the absence of a specific
commitment the Claimants could not reasonably expect that the applicable
regulatory framework provided in RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 would
remain unchanged, is backed by case law from the highest courts in Spain.
Prior to the investment, these courts had clearly established the principle that
domestic law could modify the regulations in force.

505. [...] in the present case, the Arbitration Tribunal considers that the
Claimants could have easily foreseen the possibility that the regulatory
framework was going to be modified [...]. Indeed, the Spanish Law left wide
open the possibility of modifying the remuneration scheme applicable to
photovoltaic energy. [...]

511. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants could not have the
reasonable expectation that RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 were not going
to be modified during the lifespan of their facilities.2””

However, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants had legitimate
expectations that the regulatory framework would not be fundamentally and
abruptly changed, depriving them of a significant part of their projected
revenues, as opposed to merely modified. In this regard, the Tribunal also
agrees with the Charanne v. Spain tribunal that:

[A]n investor has the legitimate expectation that, when modifying the regulation

under which it made the investment, the State will not act unreasonably,
contrary to the public interest, or in a disproportionate manner.?78

The Claimants’ legitimate expectation that the remuneration and benefits their
PV facilities received would not be radically changed were based foremost on
the express language of RD 661/2007, which sets out fixed FiTs to be paid for
entire operating life of a PV facility.2” This expectation was reinforced by
statements of Spanish officials emphasizing the stability of the remuneration
regime for PV facilities registered under RD 661/2007 and promoting the
possibility of returns for investors well above 7%.”8° Further, the Majority of the

Tribunal considers that a reasonable investor would not have interpreted the
Spanish Supreme Court jurisprudence concerning modifications to earlier
support schemes as a warning that Spain had the power to abrogate
RD 661/2007 and replace it with a radically different support scheme.
Ultimately, the Majority of the Tribunal arrives at the same conclusion as the
Novenergia v. Spain tribunal that investors such as the Claimants could not
have expected that:

a ‘reasonable rate of return’ would be limited to 7%, that stability and

predictability could not be expected in the SES, [or] that the Special Regime

could be abolished...?8'
The Respondent contends that the Claimants could not have had such
legitimate expectations because they failed to conduct proper legal due
diligence that would have confirmed the Respondent's power to replace
RD 661/2007 with the New Regulatory Regime. Indeed, none of the due
diligence reports submitted by the Claimants contain an analysis of the Spanish
legal framework surrounding RD 661/2007. 7% However, the Claimant
contends that the Garrigues Abogados law firm confirmed that RD 661/2007
assured stability and long-term remuneration throughout the whole life of the
Claimants’ PV plants. In particular, the Claimants rely on a “Note on the
Economic Regime of Application to [La Castilleja]” produced by Garrigues
dated 14 January 2010, which states:

The stability of the economic system provided under the RD 661/2007 for

electricity producers in the special regime is guaranteed by system updates

and reviews of the tariffs, premiums, and incentives provided in Article 44.283
The Respondent contends that this language does not say that the support
scheme under RD 661/2007 cannot be modified.”8 In the Tribunal’s view, the
Garrigues report is in fact rather vague on the issue. Nevertheless, the Majority
of the Tribunal considers that it is reasonable for an investor to assume that its

legal advisors would have raised a red flag had they detected any risk of
fundamental change to the regulatory regime.

Finally, the Respondent has placed particular reliance on the EC’s Decision on
State Aid dated 10 November 2017 concerning Spain’s renewables support
scheme and EU State aid rules.”®> This point can, however, be disposed of
swiftly. The EC State Aid Decision concerns the lawfulness of the New
Regulatory Regime under EU State aid law. The Commission concludes that
the New Regulatory Regime was not unlawful but that Spain wrongly failed to
notify the Commission before implementing it.2° However, the Majority of the
Tribunal considers that the decision makes no assessment of the RD 661/2007
support scheme, under which the Claimants made their investment.
Accordingly, the Majority of the Tribunal concludes that EC State Aid Decision
has no bearing on the issue of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations of

regulatory stability at the time of their investment.

(iii) Did Spain subsequently abrogate the RD 661/2007 regime? If
so, did Spain breach the Claimants’ legitimate expectations?

The Tribunal now turns to the issue of whether or not the Respondent breached
the Claimants’ legitimate expectations when it enacted the disputed measures.
As explained above, the Tribunal considers that the obligation of transparency
and consistency, and the obligation of good faith, form part of the Claimants’
legitimate expectations. The Parties’ submissions on
transparency/consistency and good faith have therefore been considered as
part of the Tribunal’s assessment of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations.

The Tribunal is cognizant of the fact that the ECT tribunals in Charanne, Isolux,
Eiser, Novenergia and Masdar have also considered the disputed measures.”°”
The Tribunal is not bound by any of those decisions and must reach its own
decision on the claims at issue in this arbitration. That said, the awards are
clearly relevant to the Tribunal’s analysis of the factual issue of whether or not
Spain abrogated the RD 661/2007 support scheme, as well as the legal
question of whether, if such an abrogation occurred, this amounts to a violation
of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations. Before turning to these questions,
the Tribunal shall therefore briefly consider the conclusions of the Charanne,

Isolux, Eiser, Novenergia and Masdar tribunals as regards the disputed
measures and the FET standard under Article 10(1) ECT.

In Charanne, the tribunal found that RD 1565/2010 and RD 14/2010 did not
violate the FET standard because the claimants could not have had a legitimate
expectation that the regulatory framework “is not to be modified at any time to
adapt to the needs of the market and to the public interest”.2°° However, the
Charanne tribunal was not called upon to assess the measures subsequently
enacted by Spain that established the New Regulatory Regime. In /solux, the
tribunal also found no breach of the FET standard, albeit on the basis that by
the time the claimant in that case had invested in June 2012, the regulatory
regime had already been modified and no reasonable investor could have had
the expectation that the framework would not be modified in future.?8°

By contrast, the Eiser, Novenergia, and Masdar cases are factually and legally
more apposite to the present case because they concern the effect of the New
Regulatory Regime on investments made before Spain started to enact the
disputed measures in 2010. The tribunals in those cases agreed with the
Charanne tribunal that RD 1565/2010 and RD 14/2010 did not violate the FET
standard under Article 10(1) ECT. However, the Eiser and Novenergia
tribunals went on to conclude that the New Regulatory Regime violated the
Claimants’ legitimate expectations of stability because it amounted to a
fundamental or radical change to the legal and regulatory framework.?°° In
Masdar, the tribunal concluded that the New Regulatory Regime violated the
claimant's legitimate expectations, based on specific commitments by Spain in
that case that the benefits granted by RD 661/2007 would remain unaltered.?°"

The Tribunal’s own assessment of RD 1565/2010, RDL 14/2010 and
RD 2/2013 concurs with that of the tribunals in Charanne, Isolux, Eiser, and
Novenergia.

RD 1565/2010 reneged on the promise under RD 661/2007 to pay FiTs for the
entire operating life of a PV facility. However, FiTs were still to be paid for the
first 25 years and this was extended to 30 years in Law 2/2011. 7%

RDL 14/2010 capped the annual operating hours for which PV facilities could
receive FiTs and imposed a 0.5 €//MWh “access toll” on all electricity a producer
delivered to the grid.?8° RD 2/2013 introduced an “amended CPI” that excluded
prices changes in food, energy products and certain tax effects for the purposes
of calculating annual FIT inflation revisions under RD 661/2007.29%4

As explained above, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants had a legitimate
expectation that the regulatory framework would not be fundamentally and
abruptly altered so as to deprive investors of a significant part of their projected
revenues. The Claimants did not, however, have a legitimate expectation that
there would be no regulatory changes to RD 661/2007 at all. In the Tribunal’s
view, none of the changes enacted by RD 1565/2010, RDL 14/2010 or
RD 2/2013 meet the threshold requirement of a fundamental change to the
regulatory framework. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that neither
RD 1565/2010, RDL 14/2010 nor RD 2/2013 breached the FET standard.

The Tribunal now turns to the New Regulatory Regime that was introduced by
Spain pursuant to RDL 9/2013, Law 24/2013, RD 413/2014 and
MO 1045/2014. The Tribunal recalls that RDL 9/2013 was enacted in July 2013
as an emergency measure to address Spain’s worsening tariff deficit.
RDL 9/2013 repealed the RD 661/2007 support scheme and authorized the
government to approve a new legal framework for renewable energy
production. The precise details of the New Regulatory Regime were
subsequently fleshed out in December 2013 by Law 24/2013 — which created
the new legal framework that eliminated the distinction between the Ordinary
and Special Regimes that had prevailed under Law 54/1997 — and was finally
settled in June 2014 by RD 413/2014 and MO 1045/2014, which established
the new support scheme that replaced RD 661/2007. The new support scheme
was applied retrospectively to PV facilities, such as the Claimants’ investments,
that had originally benefitted from the RD 661/2007 support scheme.

In the Majority of the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent abrogated RD 661/2007
and replaced it with a new support scheme under RD 413/2014 and
MO 1045/2014 pursuant to an entirely new legal and regulatory framework
under Law 24/2013. This New Regulatory Regime did not merely modify the
fixed FiTs promised to investors under RD 661/2007. Rather, it introduced a

number of fundamental changes to the support scheme for the Claimants’ PV

plants.

First, the Respondent switched the support scheme from an “at risk” model to
a “regulated return” model. As the Claimants’ regulatory experts Dr Moselle

and Dr Grunwald explain:

By switching from an “at risk” model to a “regulated return” model, Spain has
exposed investors to an asymmetric risk. Under the “at risk” model, if their
project was unsuccessful (for example, there were cost over-runs, delays, or
poor operating performance) then they were fully exposed to the outcome, so
they bore the downside risk. However, firms that bore those risks and managed
to establish efficient operating plants would then enjoy a reward in the form of
the tariffs provided for under [RD 661/2007]. Investors viewed the expected
reward, assuming a successful project, as sufficient to outweigh the costs and
risks involved in investment (else they would not have.chosen to invest).

[el

However, had they enjoyed foresight as to the-actions the Government would
later take, they would have had entirely different expectations. ...[Under the
New Regulatory Regime,] [I]nvestors in a “standard solar PV plant” would have
expected that if their project was successful then they would earn a pre-tax
return of at most 7.398% (which in itself was lower than the pre-tax return of
around 10%-11% that we estimate the same hypothetical “standard plant”
would have achieved under [RD 661/2007]); but inefficiency or ill fortune could
mean a negative return (while extraordinary efficiency would generally not be
rewarded with a higher return than 7.398%). In other words, with foresight they
would have known that they faced an asymmetric risk arising from their
potential returns having a relatively low cap, but not a floor.295

Second, the Respondent reduced the “reasonable rate of return” of a PV facility

from between 7% and 9.5% post-tax under RD 661/2007 to 7.398% pre-tax

(5.9% post-tax) under the New Regulatory Regime.?°°

Third, the Respondent raised the bar for a “standard plant” to earn the target
return under the New Regulatory Regime. Whereas the 2005 PER assumed
that a standard plant under 100kW would have an investment cost of
5,700 €/kWp, 1,250 operating hours per year, and a regulatory life of 25 years,
MO 1045 assumed an investment cost of 6,350 €/kWp, 1,648 operating hours
per year, and a regulatory life of 30 years.°9” As the Claimants’ counsel
explained at the Hearing, “under the new regulatory regime, you have to
produce more electricity for five years longer in order to earn a target return

that is 2 percentage points lower than it used in setting RD 661 on its own

case”.

Fourth, the Respondent changed the remuneration structure so that payments
were based mainly on plant capacity rather than a fixed €/MWh FIT for all
production. As well as paying most incentives based on capacity rather than
production, the New Regulatory Regime also capped all payments with a
“maximum operating hours” cut off.2°°

Fifth, the New Regulatory Regime introduced a retroactive “claw back” of
returns a PV facility had earned above 7.398% pre-tax per year prior to 2013,
in order to achieve an average return in line with the new target of
approximately 7.398% pre-tax over the entire regulatory lives of the PV
facility.2°°

Finally, the Respondent replaced the guaranteed fixed remuneration (indexed
only to inflation) under RD 661/2007 with remuneration under the New
Regulatory Regime that now varies with changes in market interest rates.
Specifically, the New Regulatory Regime initially used a 10-year historical
average of Spanish bond yields between 2003 and 2013 to arrive at the 7.398%
rate of return of a “standard plant”. However, from 2019, future updates to the
“reasonable rate of return” will be based on 2-year historical averages.
Dr Moselle and Dr Grunwald opine that the Respondent initially used the 10-
year average to average out the effect of higher rates in 2011-2013, and by
switching to a 2-year average for future updates will therefore exclude from the
rate of return calculation the higher rate observed between 2011 and 2013.5
The value of an asset that generates a fixed stream of revenue will rise and fall
inversely with market interest rates. Under RD 661/2007, the Claimants bore
the risk that interest rates would go up, and they therefore entered into swaps
to fix interest rates on their project debt. Since the Claimants made their
investments, however, market interest rates have fallen. Under the New
Regulatory Regime, investors get no benefit from this fall in interest rates.

As the Tribunal has explained in the context of its findings in respect of
RD 1565/2010, RDL 14/2010, and RDL 2/2013, sophisticated investors like the

Claimants should have reasonably expected that RD 661/2007 could be
modified, “but within foreseeable limits”.°°? For the Majority of the Tribunal, this
was not the case with the New Regulatory Regime, which as the Eiser tribunal
held was an “unprecedented and wholly different regulatory approach, based
on wholly different premises” that amounted to a “total and unreasonable
change”. The Majority of the Tribunal also agrees with the Novenergia tribunal
that the measures that enacted the New Regulatory Regime were “radical and

unexpected”.°°

The Majority of the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent's enactment of the
New Regulatory Regime constituted a fundamental change to the legal and
regulatory framework that crossed the line from a non-compensable regulatory
measure to a compensable breach of the FET standard in the ECT.
Accordingly, the Majority of the Tribunal concludes that RDL 9/2013, Law
24/2013, RD 413/2014 and MO 1045/2013 violated the FET standard as set
out in Article 10(1) ECT.

D. The Claimants’ Further Alleged Breaches of Article 10(1) ECT

The Majority of the Tribunal has found the Respondent liable for a breach of
Article 10(1) ECT for failure to accord fair and equitable treatment to the
Claimants. In addition to the FET claim, the Claimants have raised two further
claims under Article 10(1) ECT: (i) the Respondent impaired the Claimants’
investments through unreasonable or discriminatory measures (Impairment
Clause); and (ii) the Respondent failed to observe obligations it entered into
with the Claimants (Umbrella Clause).

In Novenergia, the Stockholm-seated tribunal stated that:

Under the rationale of procedural economy it is generally accepted that an
arbitral tribunal does not need to address claims and issues that are already
implied in those that are essential to its decision. This has been the view
adopted by other arbitral tribunals seized with the task of resolving claims of
multiple breaches of applicable investment treaties. Nevertheless, the
Claimant's prayers for relief are phrased in a manner that obliges a tribunal
seated in Stockholm, Sweden to rule on each request. Mindful of the decision
on the Respondent's breach of the FET standard above and of procedural
economy, the Tribunal's reasons as regards the Claimant's remaining grounds
for breach under Article 10(1) of the ECT will be brief.5%

The present case differs from Novenergia because the Claimants have not
particularized their request for relief to include their separate claims under
Article 10(1) ECT. Rather, the Claimants seek “a declaration that Spain has
violated Part Ill of the ECT and international law with respect to Claimants’

investments”.2°5

However, in their post-hearing brief, the Claimants submit that if the Tribunal
determines that only the New Regulatory Regime violated the FET standard,
then the Tribunal must also consider whether the earlier disputed measures
(RD 1565/2010 and RD 14/2010) violated the Impairment Clause and Umbrella
Clause.°°° The Respondent contends that the Tribunal is required by the SCC.
Rules to determine each claim.5°”

The Tribunal considers that the proper approach in the present case is that
adopted by the tribunal in Novenergia. Accordingly, in the following section,
the Tribunal shall briefly address the two remaining Article 10(1) ECT claims.

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. Claimants’ Position
(i) Impairment Clause

The Claimants submit that the Respondent impaired their investment through
unreasonable or discriminatory measures (or both), in violation of the
Impairment Clause in Article 10(1) ECT, which prohibits contracting host States
from “impair[ing] by unreasonable or discriminatory measures” the
“management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal” of an investment.
The Claimants submit that the term “impairment” means “any negative impact
or effect”.°° Further, the Claimants submit that the Impairment Clause sets a
low threshold for the requisite impact on an investment.3%°

The Claimants contend that the disputed measures violated the impairment
Clause because they inflicted harm on the Claimants’ investment without
serving a legitimate purpose (or “rational policy’>"°). In particular, the Claimants
contend that, although the disputed measures addressed the tariff deficit, they

att

did so in a manner that was unnecessary, arbitrary, disproportionate in impact
on renewable energy investors, and caused such investors financial harm. The
Claimants contend that the disputed measures also violated the Impairment
Clause because they violated fundamental principles of non-retroactivity and
non-discrimination by singling-out renewable energy investors.

(ii) Umbrella Clause

The Claimants submit that the Respondent violated the Umbrella Clause in
Article 10(1) ECT when it retroactively amended and then abrogated the
RD 661/2007 support scheme by which the Respondent had entered into a
number of binding legislative and regulatory obligations with regard to the
Claimants and their investment, including the obligation to pay fixed FiTs for
the lifetime of the PV facilities.

The Umbrella Clause provides that “[eJach contracting Party shall observe any
obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor
of any other Contracting Party.”. The Claimants contend that the ECT’s
umbrella clause is “famously broad” and covers legislative acts such as
RD 661/2007.3"' In particular, the Claimants rely on the express obligations to
pay FiTs in Articles 17, 36 and 44 RD 661/2007. Further, the Claimants
contend that the Respondent’s obligation to pay the RD 661/2007 FiTs was
further enshrined in the RAIPRE registrations, which specifically cross-
referenced the FiT categories in Article 36 RD 661/2007.

b. Respondent’s Position
(i) Impairment Clause

The Respondent denies that it has impaired the Claimants’ investment through
unreasonable or discriminatory measures.

The Respondent contends that the disputed measures were reasonable,
proportionate and non-discriminatory. In particular, the Respondent contends
that the disputed measures:

(a) were adopted in furtherance of a rational policy in the public interest,
namely re-establishing the economic sustainability of the SES — as
required by the applicable legislation — following the fall in electricity

demand during the financial crisis, the rise in consumer prices, over-
remuneration in the renewable energy sector, and an increasing tariff
deficit that amounted to 4% of Spain’s GDP in 2013,°"? and had placed
an excessive burden on Spanish consumers through an 81% increase
in electricity bills between 2004 and 2011;319

(b) were proportionate and successful in eliminating the tariff deficit, as
conceded by the Claimants’ regulatory expert Dr Moselle;3"

(c) did not discriminate between Spanish and foreign investors, and
required the burden to be shared by all stakeholders, including Spanish
taxpayers;3'5

(d) were consistent with the legitimate expectations of investors in a highly
subsidized sector, and delivered a reasonable rate of return to investors
generally of 7.398%, and to the Claimants specifically of 8.6% pre-
tax;316

(e) were accepted by most domestic and foreign investors, as
demonstrated by the fact that the New Regulatory Regime attracted
more than €5,000 million investment in 2015;3"7

(f) were approved by the EC, International Monetary Fund and
International Energy Agency in 2015 and 2016.918

(ii) Umbrella Clause

The Respondent denies that it has breached the Umbrella Clause. In
particular, the Respondent contends that a general regulation of erga omnes
character such as RD 661/2007 does not fall within the scope of the Umbrella
Clause because there was no specific commitment agreed with an investor or
their investment. The Respondent submits that the predominant view under
international investment law is that the umbrella clause term “entered into” —
which is found in Article 10(1) ECT — requires the host State to have assumed

specific bilateral obligations through an express and individualized commitment
to acertain investor or investment; an umbrella clause cannot elevate domestic
laws to the level of the treaty or convert them into promises.°"°

The Respondent contends that it did not assume obligations vis-a-vis the
Claimants under RD 661/2007. The Respondent relies on the finding of the
tribunal in the Charanne award that there was no specific commitment entered
into by Spain towards the claimants in that case under the RD 661/2007 and
RD 1578/2008 regulatory frameworks.°*° The Respondent further relies on
Isolux, in which the tribunal held that the ECT’s umbrella clause did not apply
to RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 because they were not expressly designed
to seek foreign investment and “a regulation aimed at both domestic and
foreign investors cannot, due to its general character, generate obligations only
for the first ones...”.52! The Respondent also submits that such a commitment
to maintain unchanging FiTs is not permitted under EU State aid rules.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis
(i) Impairment Clause

In the Tribunal’s view, the standard of protection in the Impairment Clause is
part of or at least linked to the same standard set out in the FET Clause.
Moreover, the factual and legal basis of the Claimants’ claim under the
Impairment Clause is the same as the Claimants’ FET claim. This being so,
the Majority of the Tribunal has concluded that it has nothing further to add to
its decision on the Claimants’ FET claim above. Accordingly, the Majority of
the Tribunal determines that it is unnecessary to reach on a separate
determination of the Claimants’ claim under the Impairment Clause, which has
been effectively disposed of by the Majority of the Tribunal’s decision of the
Claimants’ FET claim.

(ii) Umbrella Clause

In the Tribunal’s view, the obligation on the Respondent under
Article 10(1) ECT to “observe any obligations it has entered into with an
Investor or an Investment of an Investor” applies to a specific commitment

325

rather than a general regulatory act.°° The Tribunal has concluded that the
Respondent did not make such a specific commitment to the Claimants.
Neither the terms of RD 661/2007, nor the registrations of the Claimants’ PV
facilities in the RAIPRE, amount to an obligation entered into by Spain with the
Claimants for the purposes of Article 10(1) ECT. Accordingly, the Claimants’
claim under the Umbrella Clause is dismissed.

E. Expropriation under Article 13 ECT
(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. Claimants’ Position

The Claimants contend that the Respondent's “progressive erosion” of their
rights under RD 661/2007, and the subsequent abrogation of the regime
altogether, amount to an unlawful indirect expropriation of the Claimants’
investment under Article 13 ECT.***

The Claimants contend that the Respondent has expropriated their
“Investments” under the ECT, namely the future right under RD 661/2007 to
receive guaranteed FiTs (i.e. moneys and returns) for the lifetime of their PV
Plants’ operations. The Claimants submit that their investment may be viewed
as “property rights”, “claims to money”, or “any right conferred by law”, which
all fall within the definition of “Investments” under the ECT.*° The Claimants
also appear to contend that their investment includes “returns”.*76

In particular, the Claimants contend that following measures were
expropriatory:

(i) In 2010, the Respondent retroactively cancelled the right of the
Claimants’ PV facilities to receive the RD 661/2007 FIT after
Year 25 (later extended to Year 30) (RD 1565/2010), and
imposed operating hour limitations on Claimants’ PV facilities
(RDL 14/2010);

420.

(ii) In 2012, the Respondent imposed a 7% purported “tax” on
electricity production that reduced the revenues (including tariff
revenues) of the Claimants’ PV facilities (Law 15/2012);

(iii) In 2013, the Respondent replaced the CPI with a lower index for
the purpose of adjusting RD 661/2007 FiTs annually for inflation
(RDL 2/2013);

(iv) In 2013/2014, the Respondent abrogated RD 661/2007 in its
entirety when it enacted the New Regulatory Regime
(Law 24/2013, RD 413/2014, MO 1045/2014).

The Claimants contend that the cumulative effect of the Respondent's
measures was to substantially deprive the Claimants of the value of their
investment, specifically almost the entire equity value (83%*”) in their PV
facilities, thus constituting a “taking” under Article 13(1) ECT.°° The Claimants
further contend that tribunals have found a “substantial interference” with the
control or the economic value of an investment to constitute a “substantial
deprivation” 329

The Claimants contend that the Tribunal should not follow the Charanne award
because it did not properly consider the issue of indirect ownership of the right
to FiTs guaranteed by RD 661/2007, and only considered measures adopted
by the Respondent in 2010.

b. Respondent’s Position
The Respondent denies that it has expropriated the Claimants’ investment.

First, the Respondent contends that the Claimants do not have the acquired
right under Spanish law to receive the RD 661/2007 FiTs in future, as confirmed
by the Respondent's expert Professor Vaquer at the Hearing.**° Since the
Claimants do not have this right, the Respondent contends that such future
returns are not an asset “owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an
Investor” for the purposes of Article 1(6) ECT. The Respondent submits that

331

the Tribunal should adopt the conclusions on the Charanne tribunal on this

point.33"

Second, the Respondent contends that the Claimants’ only protected
investment is their shareholding in the PV facilities, and the disputed measures
have not caused a substantial deprivation in the value of these shares.

Third, even assuming the Claimants’ investment suffered harm, there is no
requirement under the ECT or international investment law to compensate the
Claimants because the contested measures were enacted in good faith and in
accordance with due process pursuant to the Respondent's police power to
regulate the energy sector in the public interest, and were non-discriminatory,
reasonable and proportionate to the objective of resolving the tariff deficit and
re-establishing the economic balance of the SES.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal has determined that the Respondent did not expropriate the
Claimants’ investment and has not therefore violated Article 13 ECT.

Article 13(1) ECT provides in relevant part as follows:

1. Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other
Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to a
measure or measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or
expropriation (hereinafter referred to as "Expropriation") except where
such Expropriation is:

)
)) not discriminatory;

) carried out under due process of law; and

) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and
fective compensation.

The definition of “Investments” is to be found under Article 1(6) ECT:

every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor and
includes:

(a) tangible and intangible, and movable and immovable, property, and any
property rights such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges;

(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity
participation in a company or business enterprise, and bonds and other debt
of a company or business enterprise;

(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract having an
economic value and associated with an Investment;

(d) Intellectual Property;

CL-92/RL-49, Charanne, §{ 458-459.

105

426.

427.

428.

429.

(e) Returns;
(f) any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licenses and permits
granted pursuant to law to undertake any Economic Activity in the Energy
Sector.
The Tribunal considers that the Claimants invested in shares in the holding
companies that owned the PV facilities. The Claimants’ investment therefore

falls under the definition at Article 1(6)(b) ECT.

This case does not concern a nationalization or direct expropriation because
the Claimants have not been deprived of legal title to the PV facilities as a result
of the disputed measures. Rather, the Claimants’ claim under Article 13 ECT
concerns “measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or
expropriation”, i.e. an indirect or de facto expropriation, of the Claimants’
alleged right to receive the full value of the RD 661/2007 FiTs over the entire
operating lives of their PV facilities.

The Claimants contend that 83% of the value of their equity investment in the
companies that own the PV facilities has been destroyed as a result of the
disputed measures.**? This, the Claimants submit, amounts to a substantial
deprivation, or “substantial interference”, and thus constitutes an expropriation
of their investment.

The Claimants are correct that the standard for expropriation requires a
substantial deprivation of the use, benefit, or value of the investment. °°
However, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the Claimants are still
the “untouched” owners of the PV facilities. The Respondent contends that
these PV facilities continue to earn returns of 8.6% pre-tax under the New
Regulatory Regime.*** The Claimants contest the Respondent's calculation,
but still report an internal rate of return (IRR) of 5.5% post-tax.*5

The Majority of the Tribunal accepts that the Claimants have suffered serious
financial losses as a result of the disputed measures. But this is not enough to

sustain an expropriation claim. The Tribunal recalls the finding of the Charanne
tribunal that:

For a measure to be considered as equivalent to an expropriation, its effects
must be of such a significance that it could be considered that the investor has
been deprived, in whole or in part, of its investment. A simple decrease in the
value of the shares constituting the investment cannot constitute an indirect
expropriation, unless the loss of value is such that it can be considered
equivalent to a deprivation of property.2%°
431. In the Tribunal’s view, the disputed measures did not substantially deprive the
Claimants’ of the value, use or enjoyment of their investment. Accordingly, the

Claimants’ claim under Article 13 ECT is dismissed.
Vill. DAMAGES
A. Applicable Standard

432. The Tribunal, by a majority, has found that the Respondent violated its
obligation under Article 10(1) ECT to accord fair and equitable treatment to the
Claimants’ investments. Unlike Article 13 ECT concerning expropriation, the
ECT does not set out a standard of compensation for breaches of Article 10(1)
ECT. The Tribunal therefore looks to customary international law for the
applicable standard of compensation.

433. Under international law, a State is required to make full reparation for the
damage caused by a treaty breach or other internationally wrongful act.

434. The principle of full reparation was articulated by the Permanent Court of
International Justice (PCJ) in the Chorzéw Factory case. The PCJ stated that:

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act - a
principle which seems to be established by international practice and in
particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as far
as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish
the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been
committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum
corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if
need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by
restitution in kind or payment in place of it - such are the principles which
should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary
to international law.397

The principle articulated by the PCJ in Chorzéwis reflected in Article 31 of the
International Law Commission’s Articles on the Responsibility of States for
Internationally Wrongful Acts, which provides that:

1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the
injury caused by the inter- nationally wrongful act.
2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the
internationally wrongful act of a State.°°°

The Tribunal further considers that the principle of full reparation is generally

accepted in international investment law. As the tribunal in Vivendi I/ observed:

[b]ased on these principles, and absent limiting terms in the relevant treaty, it
is generally accepted today that, regardless of the type of investment, and
regardless of the nature of the illegitimate measure, the level of damages
awarded in international investment arbitration is supposed to be sufficient to
compensate the affected party fully and to eliminate the consequences of the
state’s action.299

The Tribunal also agrees with the Annulment Committee in Azurix v. Argentina

that, “for breaches of BIT obligations other than the expropriation clause, the

Tribunal has a discretion in determining the approach to damages”.**° The

Tribunal considers that this statement is equally applicable to the ECT.

In conclusion, the Tribunal, by a majority, has decided that the Claimants are
in principle entitled to full compensation for Spain’s violation of Article 10(1)
ECT. The Tribunal shall now turn to the Parties’ respective submissions on

quantum.

B. Quantum of Compensation
(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. Claimants’ Position
(i) Overview

The Claimants seek damages for the diminution in the market value of their
investments in the three PV facilities as a result of the disputed measures.

The Claimants’ quantum expert, Mr Richard Edwards of FTI, uses a discounted
cash flow (DCF) method to assess the impact of hypothetical lost revenue
caused by the disputed measures on the market value of the Claimants’
investments in the PV facilities.

On this basis, the Claimants claim total losses before interest of €58.2 million.
The Claimants also claim interest on these losses based alternatively on the
Respondent's or the Claimants’ cost of borrowing, as detailed below.

(ii) Claimants’ DCF methodology

The Claimants explain the valuation methodology of their quantum expert as
follows:

As set out in the FT| Quantum Report, FTI calculates the quantum of
compensation that Spain owes to Claimants in respect of their three solar
plants based on the difference between: (a) the market value that Claimants’
investments in Spain would have had if Spain had not introduced the
challenged measures, based on the Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) method
(the “Counterfactual Position”); and (b) the market value of those investments
after the introduction of the challenged measures, as reflected by the proceeds
that the Claimants actually received (or expect to receive) from completed or
imminent sales of the investments in arms’ length transactions (the “Actual
Position”). The specific investments that FTI values are the Claimants’ equity
interests in and shareholder loans to the operating companies that owned
those three PV plants in Spain.**'

At the Claimants’ instruction, FT| has assessed the impact of the disputed
measures as of 30 June 2014 (Date of Assessment), at which time Foresight
and Greentech owned and operated the Madridejos, La Castilleja and
Fotocampillos plants. The Claimants submit that this is an appropriate Date of
Assessment because it is the end of the quarter shortly after the Respondent
had enacted RD 413/2014 on 10 June 2014 and published MO 1045 on 20

SoC, 4 449 [emphasis added].

109

June 2014, at which point the full impact of the disputed measures was known
to the market.

444. TI's assessment of the Claimants’ losses is the difference in his opinion
between the market value of their investments on the Date of the Assessment
as they actually were after the Respondent had enacted the disputed measures
(Actual Position), and as they would hypothetically have been had the
disputed measures not have been made (Counterfactual Position).

445. For the Actual Position, FTI uses the actual prices at which the Claimants sold
their entire interests in the three plants in 2015 and 2016, as these sales were
all arm’s length transactions. Adjusting for (i) cash injections that the Claimants
made into the companies after the Date of Assessment, and (ii) the passage of
time, FTI arrives at an equity value of €12.2 million (€6.8 million in respect of
Foresight’s investment and €5.4 million in respect of GWM/Greentech’s
investment). (For the purposes of a “sanity check” on the valuation in the Actual
Position, FTI also ran a calculation using a simplified DCF approach that
resulted in a slightly higher valuation that would have reduced the Claimants’
ultimate losses by €3 million, or approximately 5%.5*)

446. For the Counterfactual Position, FTl’s valuation is based on a forecast of
operational cash flows of the PV facilities. FTI assumes that the Claimants
succeed on their claim as pleaded, which is to say that the Claimants’ PV
facilities were entitled to receive the full FiTs set out under RD 661/2007.

447. FTI calculates that the disputed measures reduced the revenues of the
Claimants’ PV facilities by approximately 23%.°4° Put another way, the
Claimants’ PV facilities would have earned more than €150 million in additional
revenue over their lifetimes had the disputed measures not been enacted.°4*
The following chart taken from Mr Edwards’ First Expert Report illustrates FTI’s
forecast of the actual and counterfactual revenues (in € millions) of the
Claimants’ three PV plants over their assumed 35-year operating lives:*°

Pursuant to the DCF methodology, FTI discounted the forecasted cash flows
using a cost of capital of 5.5% based on the weighted average cost of capital
(WACC) of the Claimants’ PV facilities.4° From this, FTI calculates that the
total equity value of the Claimants’ investment interests in the operating
companies in the Counterfactual Position is €70.4 million (€44.3 million
representing Foresight’s ownership and €26.1 million representing
GWWMGreentech’s interest).

To arrive at the final calculation of loss, FTI subtracts the value of each of the
Claimants’ investments in the Actual Position from the hypothetical value of
those investments in the Counterfactual Position. FTI’s final calculation of total
loss in respect of both Foresight and GWM/Greentech is €58.2 million, broken
down as follows:*4”

the Claimants’ PV facilities and an 83% decrease in the value of the Claimants’
equity in their investments. 548

The Claimants contend that the DCF approach has been strongly endorsed by
several tribunals considering the same disputed measures enacted by
Spain.*°_ In Mr Edwards’ opinion, the DCF method is appropriate in this case
because the future cash flows of PV facilities are very predictable. In
particular, the price at which electricity is sold is clearly defined under
RD 661/2007, annual electricity production is largely predictable
notwithstanding weather fluctuations, and operating costs are also relatively
predictable as well as being relatively small.

The Claimants submit that their damages claim corresponds to losses
attributable to all of the disputed measures. The Claimants reject as groundless
the Respondent's contentions that the Claimants have not satisfied their burden
of proof because they did not separately quantify damages for each disputed

measure, or that the Claimants should have separately quantified losses based
on different liability theories, such as FET and expropriation.°°'

The Claimants also request that the Tribunal award pre- and post-award
compound interest at the highest lawful rate from the Date of Assessment until
the date that the Respondent pays the award in full.

At the Claimants’ instruction, FT| submitted two alternative interest calculations
on the Claimants’ losses from the Date of Assessment until January 2018,
calculated using either the Respondent's cost of borrowing (Spanish 5-year
government bonds) or the Claimants’ cost of borrowing (Claimants’ cost of
debt). Foresight’s total loss including interest amounts to between
€38.1 million or €41.4 million, and Greentech’s total loss including interest
amounts to between €21.0 million or €22.8 million.2%*

(iii) Rebuttals to Respondent's calculations

Mr Edwards identifies three (or possibly four) different approaches used by the
Respondent's quantum expert, BDO, to assess the Claimants’ losses on their
investments in the PV facilities.

In summary, Mr Edwards offers the following critiques of BDO’s approaches:

(a) Regulatory asset base (RAB) method (BDO assesses no loss to the
Claimants**’): Mr Edwards criticises this approach because it assumes
that the Claimants do not prevail on liability, i.e. BDO assumes that the
Claimants were only ever entitled to earn a “reasonable rate of return’,
which is the Respondent's case, and that the Respondent was therefore
not obliged to ensure that the fixed FiTs under RD 661/2007 were paid
to the Claimants’ PV facilities. Moreover, Mr Edwards opines that BDO
makes two further assumptions “that render all of its discussions and
calculations utterly irrelevant’.2%* First, BDO assumes that the RABs of
Claimants’ PV facilities are the same in the Actual Position and
Counterfactual Position. Second, BDO assumes that the valuation
multiple would be the same in both the Actual and Counterfactual
positions. At the Hearing, Mr Edwards opined that: “If you’re simply

going to assume that the value of the two assets is the same in both
scenarios, then of course losses are nil. The whole exercise is utterly
redundant.”255

(b) DCF method assuming a reasonable rate of return (BDO assess a
€1.2 million gain by the Claimants*°*): Mr Edwards criticizes BDO’s
approach because it assumes that the Claimants were only entitled to
earn a “reasonable rate of return”, and not the FiTs under RD 661/2007.
Mr Edwards considers that BDO has reverse-engineered FiTs that
deliver a return equal to the cost of capital over the life of the Claimants’

PV facilities so as to conclude that the Claimants’ losses are nil;

(c) DCF method with premium for risk of system collapse (BDO assesses
the impact as ranging from a loss of €18 million to a gain of €5 million
depending on the assumptions used**’): Mr Edwards opines that the
difference between the Parties’ respective DCF calculations is largely
attributable to: (i) BDO’s assumption that the Claimants’ PV facilities
would receive the RD 661/2007 FiTs for only the first 30 years of their
operating life; and (ii) BDO’s discount of the counterfactual cash flows
to reflect the risk of system collapse under the weight of the tariff deficit,
ie. the Respondent being unable to pay the RD 661/2007 FiTs.%8
Mr Edwards considers this discount (which reduces damages by
around 60%, from €44.7 million to €18.1 million) to be inappropriate,
because inter alia the Claimants’ case is that the Respondent had to
ensure payment of the FiTs, and the default risk cannot be materially
higher in the Counterfactual Position as the disputed measures did not
materially affect the Spanish economy in the Actual Position.

(d) Rate of return (BDO assesses no loss®*™): Mr Edwards offers a critique
of an apparent fourth valuation method proposed by BDO that asserts
the actual IRRs (8.6% pre-tax) of the Claimants’ PV facilities exceed the
rate of return of 7.398% pre-tax offered under the New Regulatory

Regime, and therefore the Claimants suffered no loss.°°' Mr Edwards
opines that the IRRs are materially inflated because BDO has artificially
lowered investment costs and reduced operating costs; the IRRs in the
Actual Position are in fact 5.5% post-tax.®* Again, Mr Edwards opines
that BDO’s approach also incorrectly assumes that Spain did not have
to pay the FiTs under RD 661/2007.

b. Respondent’s Position
(i) Overview
The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ damages claim.

Even if the Tribunal finds liability on the merits, the Respondent contends that
the Claimants’ damages claim must be denied because the Claimants have
failed to discharge their burden of proof. The Respondent relies on the
following statement of the Gemplus v. Mexico tribunal:

Burden of Proof: Under international law and the BITs, the Claimants bear the
overall burden of proving the loss founding their claims for compensation. If
that loss is found to be too uncertain or speculative or otherwise unproven, the
Tribunal must reject these claims, even if liability is established against the
Respondent ...23
The Respondent’s quantum expert, BDO, opines that the Claimants’ valuation
method based on DCF is flawed because it fails to consider the main structural
features of the SES (sustainability and reasonable return) in the context of the
tariff deficit that existed at the time of the disputed measures, and is highly
speculative. By contrast, BDO relies primarily on a RAB-based approach to
conclude that the value of the Claimants’ investments did not change as a result
of the disputed measures because the PV facilities’ returns in the long run will
tend to a reasonable return required by the capital markets in both actual and
but-for scenarios. **4 According to BDO’s calculations, the disputed measures
allowed the Claimants to recover their cost of investment and receive a
reasonable return on their investments. Moreover, BDO opines that the PV
facilities’ actual value and but-for value are significantly higher than their book

value. Accordingly, BDO concludes that the Claimants’ PV facilities cannot
have suffered losses.

The Respondent also rejects the Claimants’ claim for interest. In the event that
the Tribunal awards interest, however, the Respondent submits that the 5-year
Spanish Government bond yield is the appropriate interest rate because it
reflects a “risk-free” rate.

(ii) Critique of Claimants’ DCF methodology

First of all, the Respondent submits that the Claimants’ use of the DCF method
is inappropriate because it is inherently speculative. The Respondent cites
Ripinksy on Damages in International Investment Law, which states in part that:

[T]he future is uncertain and looking into the future requires one to make
numerous assumptions and subjective choices regarding future market
conditions, sales, costs, additional capital requirements, currency fluctuations,
rates of inflation, levels of risk, etc. The end-result is thus inherently somewhat
speculative. This explains why litigating parties’ experts frequently produce
DCF valuations with diverging results. Noting this tendency, Stauffer has
warned against a ‘Cinderella effect’, that is, overvaluation of assets by
claimants in their DCF valuations.3°5
The Respondent also contends that the Claimants’ valuation is based on the
mistaken premise that the FiTs under RD 661/2007 would remain frozen in
future. As a result, FTI’s assessment of loss fails to take account of the
regulatory risk that Spain might exercise its power to change the FiTs,°°° and

of the fact that the Claimants invested at a time of “high regulatory risk”.°°”

In BDO’s opinion, the valuation approach of the Claimants’ expert, FTI, fails to
consider: (i) the main structural features of the SES, namely the principles of
sustainability and reasonable return; and (ii) the fact that there was a structural
imbalance at the relevant time that threatened the sustainability of the SES.
Moreover, BDO opine that FTI’s valuation approach is “highly speculative, and
therefore unreliable, due to the high level of uncertainty and subjectivity of
methodologies, assumptions and parameters used”.°°® BDO consider that
FTI’s operating assumptions, such as production, useful life and discount rate,
have a strong impact on his final damages calculation.* For example, BDO

challenge the basis for FTI’s assumption that the useful life of the Claimants’
PV plants is 35 years. In BDO’s opinion, the model should assume no more
than 30 years, based on the fact that the 2005 PER assumes a useful life of 25
years, the annual accounts of the Claimants’ PV facilities do not foresee a
useful life over 30 years, and the impairment tests run for the Claimants’ PV
facilities also assume a useful life of 30 years.2”°

Other methodological criticisms offered by BDO include that FTI’s valuation
approaches lack a “reality check” (i.e. additional support to compare how
reasonable the results obtained are),°”' and that FTI inconsistently uses a DCF
method in the Counterfactual Position at the same time as using an arm's
length transaction valuation method in the Actual Position, which results in a
€3 million lower valuation in the Actual Position than would be using a DCF
method.372

The Respondent raises a number of other criticisms of the Claimants’ valuation,
including that FTl’s Date of Assessment is disconnected from the date of the
disputed measures, and that FTI does not consider the individual impact of
each disputed measure sequentially.°”°

BDO also criticize FTI’s alternative calculation that, like BDO, assumes a
reasonable rate of return rather than fixed FiTs. BDO’s criticisms include that
FTI wrongly assumes 8% or 9% returns when RD 661/2007 in fact established
a post-tax target return of 7% for a standard installation.2”

The Respondent also contends that the principles of assessment used by the
Claimants are appropriate to an expropriation claim, but that compensation for
breaches of other ECT standards such as FET requires the Tribunal to reach
an equitable outcome. The Respondent relies on the commentary to Article 36
of the International Law Commission's Articles on the Responsibility of States
for Internationally Wrongful Acts, which states:

As to the appropriate heads of compensable damage and the principles of

assessment to be applied in quantification, these will vary, depending upon the
content of particular primary obligations, an evaluation of the

respective behaviour of the parties and, more generally, a concern to reach an

equitable and acceptable outcome.375
In this regard, the Respondent submits that it is relevant to achieving such an
“equitable outcome” that the Claimants’ PV Plants are in fact highly profitable
today thanks to the subsidies they receive from Spain. The Respondent also
focuses on the amounts that the Claimants actually invested in the PV Plants.
In particular, the Respondent contends that the Claimants’ compensation claim
(for between approximately €59 million and €64 million) is disproportionate
because the Claimants only invested €25.8 million to acquire their interests in
the three PV facilities at issue.°”°

(iii) Respondent's valuations

BDO’s preferred approach to valuing the Claimants’ investments is a RAB-
based method that takes account of the SES principles of sustainability and
reasonable return.5”” BDO opine that, under the reasonable return principle,
long-term returns will tend to follow returns required by the capital markets.
Accordingly, BDO assumes that the market value of a PV plant will be closely
related to the efficient investment cost, or RAB.

BDO concludes that the value of the Claimants’ investments does not change
as a result of the disputed measures. In BDO’s opinion:

254. Given that the regulatory value is estimated considering the cost of
efficient market investment, this value can also be assumed to be the
regulatory value in the But-for scenario. Likewise, the multiple to be applied
should be similar in the But-for and Actual scenarios given that it should reflect
the fact that returns obtained should approximate the return demanded by the
market.

255. Our conclusion that the multiple over the value of a regulated asset will
be similar in each scenario that arises starts from the premise that the return
to be obtained by efficient producers, regardless of the specific regulatory
regime of application, will tend to resemble the return required by capital
markets. Therefore, this multiple will be similar in both scenarios due to the
adjustment mechanisms of the system itself.

256. Such adjustment mechanisms would have focused on the measures
under consideration or on other measures of any other nature (by adjusting the

CL-175, International Law Commission's Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally
Wrongful Acts, 28 January 2002, Article 36, Commentary 7.

The Claimants submit that Foresight’s acquisition costs were approximately €9.3 million for
Madridejos and €6.35 million for La Castilleja, and GWM/Greentech’s acquisition costs were
approximately €6.3 million for La Castilleja and €3.8 million for Fotocampillos. Claimants’ PHB,

premiums, eliminating them, etc.), so that the return to be obtained by the
producers of renewable energy would have been adjusted to the market return.

257. Therefore, the flows of a But-for scenario like those of the Actual scenario,
in one way or another, must also tend to obtain the return demanded by the
capital markets.378

In addition to the primary valuation based on RAB, BDO submitted alternative
calculations using the following different methodologies:

(a) Alternative calculation following the DCF methodology and based on
SES principles: Using the DCF methodology, BDO assumes that in the
Counterfactual Position investors will always obtain returns close to the
market return (or “reasonable return”). The result is that the value of
the Claimants’ investments is €1.2 million higher in the Actual
Position.°”°

(b) Alternative calculation based on FTI’s primary valuation approach: BDO
adjusts the assumptions in Mr Edwards’ model, particularly the discount
rate in the Counterfactual Position and the useful life of the Claimants’
PV plants. The impact ranges from a loss of €18 million to an increase
in value of €5 million.3®°

(c) Alternative calculation based on FTI’s alternative valuation approach:
BDO adjusts the assumptions in Mr Edwards’ model, particularly the
actual value base (standard), the useful life of the Claimants’ PV plants
and the Counterfactual Position discount rate. The impact ranges from
a loss of €10 million to a loss of €2 million.°*"

The Respondent contends that a RAB-based approach is frequently used in
regulated industry sectors, as well as the renewable energy industry, and is
more reliable than the DCF approach preferred by the Claimants’ expert.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Claimants seek damages of €58.2 million, which they contend represents
the diminution in the fair market value of their equity in the PV facilities as a
result of all the disputed measures combined.

As will be further elaborated upon below, the Majority of the Tribunal has
decided that the Claimants’ approach to calculating damages, which employs
the DCF method to model the present value of lost cash flows resulting from
the disputed measures, is an appropriate basis for determining the quantum of
compensation that should be awarded to the Claimants for the Respondent's
violation of Article 10(1) ECT.

The Tribunal shall begin its analysis by considering the Parties’ submissions
on the appropriate valuation method, before turning to the Claimants’
assessment of damages and the Respondent's criticisms thereof.

(i) Valuation Method

The Parties do not agree on the appropriate valuation method. The Claimants
consider that an income-based valuation, using the DCF method to calculate
the hypothetical market value of the Claimants’ investments had Spain not
introduced the disputed measures, is appropriate. °° The Respondent
contends that the DCF method is inappropriate because it is too speculative.**>
The Respondent instead proposes an asset-based valuation.

The Majority of the Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent’s objections to the
use of the DCF method in this case, which concerns the future financial
performance of PV assets with up to five years of operating history. As the
tribunal in Novenergia, which also concerned investments in PV facilities,°*
stated:

[T]he DCF-valuation is based on fundamental principles of economic and
finance and is regarded by many as the preferred method for valuation of
income-earning assets. The DCF-method is widely supported in professional
literature, but more importantly, the method has been broadly accepted by
numerous arbitral tribunals as "the only method which can accurately track
value through time" and "the preferred method of calculating damages in cases
involving the appropriation of or fundamental impairment of going concerns".
In the words of the CMS v. Argentina tribunal: “DCF techniques have been
universally adopted, including by numerous arbitral tribunals, as an appropriate
method for valuing business assets”.28>

Indeed, the DCF method is routinely used in the PV industry because of the
predictability of PV facilities. As Mr Edwards of FTI, the Claimants’ expert,
stated:

Assuming a stable regulatory regime, | consider that the operational and
financial performance of PV plants is relatively predictable once they have
been operational for a period sufficient to establish the efficiency of the
equipment. As | note in my First Report, unlike many businesses, PV plants
registered under RD 661 can sell all that they produce for a price (or revenue)
that is highly predictable. In other words, they are not subject to the competitive
risks that most businesses face. The weather does vary from year to year, but
electricity production tends to follow a fairly predictable pattern [...]. Costs are
also relatively predictable and relatively small in comparison to capital costs
and revenues — PV plants do not have to acquire raw materials or feedstock,
and the most significant costs (operations and maintenance) are typically
governed by multiyear contracts.386

Mr Edwards also explained that:

[T]he DCF method is widely used to assess the value of PV plants in Spain. |
have worked on a number of matters (both contentious and not) that involved
assessing the value of PV plants in Spain. In every matter the primary, and
often the only, method used to value PV plants by the parties involved
(including lenders, investors, and third party valuation advisors) is DCF. For
example:

(1) Foresight uses the DCF method for assessing the value of the
assets in the Foresight European Solar Fund for its investors, which
Madridejos and La Castilleja were part of;

(2) Greentech uses the DCF method in its impairment testing of the
Spanish Plants, which is reviewed and approved by Greentech’s
auditors;

(3) Foresight relied upon the DCF method when acquiring its
investments in the Spanish Plants; and

(4) other investors in the industry, including companies such as EDF
Energies Nouvelles, also use DCF in their impairment testing.°°”

Further, the Majority of the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the DCF

method is appropriate in this case, because: “the future performance of

operating solar PV plants is relatively predictable (i.e., they can sell all of the

electricity they produce at prices and costs that are known or can be forecast

with a high degree of confidence for a significant period of time).”°*

The Majority of the Tribunal’s conclusion that the DCF approach is appropriate

is not undermined by the “sensitivity analysis” performed by BDO that results

in a reduction of €55 million to FTI’s loss assessment. In its assessment, BDO

increased the discount rate from 5.5% to 7.5%, reduced production forecasts
by 15%, and reduced the useful life of the Claimants’ PV facilities from 35 to 30

years.°° The Majority of the Tribunal agrees with FTI that “it is not surprising
that significant changes to the inputs of a model can result in significant
changes to the outputs”.*°° The Majority of the Tribunal has confidence in FTI's
general approach and considers the model to be reliable. Nevertheless, the
Tribunal shall consider later in this section the reasonableness of the
assumptions used by FTI, and whether any adjustments should be made.

482. As for the “Regulated Asset Base” (RAB) approach favoured by the
Respondent's expert BDO, the Majority of the Tribunal is not persuaded that
this is more appropriate in the particular circumstances of this case than the
DCF valuation method. Moreover, the Majority of the Tribunal does not have
confidence in BDO’s overall approach to its RAB valuation, which is based on
the efficient construction cost.

483. In particular, the Majority of the Tribunal is not convinced by BDO’s
assumptions that: (i) the RAB of each of the Claimants’ PV facilities would have
been the same in the Actual Position and the Counterfactual Position; and
(ii) the applicable EV/RAB multiples applied to value the Claimants’ three PV
facilities would also have been similar in the Actual Position and the
Counterfactual Position.**' It would appear that BDO’s conclusion that the
disputed measures have not caused any loss to the Claimants’ investments
necessarily follows from their assumption that, in both the Counterfactual and
Actual Positions, the Claimants’ PV facilities were only ever entitled to a
regulated rate of return that fluctuated with interest rates.

484. As Mr Edwards opines:

BDO's ingoing assumption that investors were only ever entitled to receive a
return similar to the return they have received and will receive under the current
regime means that the values of the Spanish Plants would not have been
higher in the Counterfactual Position than they actually are. This is because
investors would (or should) have expected returns to be regulated in ways
similar to the steps actually taken by Spain. By assumption, therefore, losses
are nil.392

485. This assumption is incompatible with the Majority of the Tribunal’s findings that
the RD 661/2007 support scheme, under which the Claimants’ invested,
offered fixed FiTs. In fact, compensation only subsequently became linked to
the concept of a reasonable return rather than a fixed FiT when the Respondent

repealed and replaced RD 661/2007 with the New Regulatory Regime. The
Majority of the Tribunal agrees with FTI that:
Given these assumptions [that the RABs and RAB multiples are the same in
the Counterfactual Position and Actual Position], it is obvious that BDO will
conclude that the value of the plants is the same in both Positions, and assess

the losses as nil. It is irrelevant what the RABs of the plants are, or what
multiple of RAB ought to apply.

By assuming that Spain was entitled to limit returns to a “reasonable” level that
varies over time, and that the current regime does this, the outcome of this
calculation is pre-determined.399

In sum, the Majority of the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent's RAB
valuation approach. The Majority of the Tribunal shall instead assess damages
in this case on the basis of the Parties’ valuations derived from the DCF method,
which is the more appropriate approach in this case.

(ii) FTI’s primary DCF valuation

The Majority of the Tribunal considers that the Claimants’ primary DCF model
is an appropriate method for calculating the Claimants’ damages in the
particular circumstances of this case. Further, the Majority of the Tribunal
considers that the Claimants’ primary DCF model is comprehensive and its
methodology is robust. For the reasons to be discussed, the Majority of the
Tribunal is not persuaded that BDO’s DCF models should be preferred. The
Majority of the Tribunal shall therefore use the Claimants’ primary DCF model
and the assumptions contained therein as a baseline for valuing the Claimants’
loss. In the exercise of its broad discretion in matters of quantum, the Majority
of the Tribunal shall then consider whether or not any adjustments should be
made to the Claimants’ valuation in light of the Respondent's criticisms thereof.

The Claimants’ primary valuation of the impact of the disputed measures on
their investments is the difference between (a) the hypothetical market value of
the Claimants’ equity interests in and shareholder loans to the operating
companies that owned the three PV facilities had the disputed measures not
been enacted (Counterfactual Position), based on a model of future cash flows
of each PV facility constructed using the DCF method; and (b) the market value

FTI 24, 99 3.17-3.18.
123

491.

304

of the Claimants’ investments after the introduction of the disputed measures

(Actual Position).

The Date of Assessment is 30 June 2014, which is the end of the quarter in

which the New Regulatory Regime was finalized by RD 413/2014 (enacted on
10 June 2014) and MO 1045 (enacted on 20 June 2014). In the Majority of the
Tribunal’s view, this is an appropriate date to use, as it corresponds to the time

when the definitive terms of the New Regulatory Regime became known to the

market.

The Claimants contend that:

FTI calculates the value of the three solar PV projects in the Counterfactual
Position under the regulatory framework enacted in RD 661/2007, assuming
that Spain never enacted the challenged measures. This is a very
straightforward DCF calculation because the companies were legally entitled
to sell all of their electricity production at the tariff rates guaranteed in the
regulations. Thus, FTI’s DCF model in the Counterfactual Position entails only
a few material projections, which themselves can be estimated with a high
degree of reliability, including:

Electricity Production: FTI projects future electricity production based on
each company’s average historical production in each full year from 2011
through the end of 2014. FTI then applies a degradation factor of 0.5%
per annum to account for future declines in the efficiency of the solar
panels, which is consistent with Spain's own assumptions regarding future
panel performance in MO-1045;

Inflation: Under RD 661/2007, the tariffs were to be adjusted annually
based on the Spanish CPI (less 0.25% until 2012 and 0.5% thereafter). FTI
projects future inflation in the near term (through 2019) based on forecasts
published by the International Monetary Fund, and in the longer term
based on the European Central Bank’s inflation target;

Operating life: FT| projects that Claimants’ plants will continue to operate,
and thus continue to receive the tariffs and complements guaranteed by
RD 661/2007, for 35 years from inception. A useful life expectancy of 35
years is supported by a study published by the European Commission in
2011, and the Claimants also expected their facilities to operate for at least
30 to 40 years;

Operating costs: FTI projects future operating costs based on the
companies’ historical costs and forward-looking budgets (excluding the
access toll imposed by Royal Decree 14/2010 and the 7% energy tax
imposed by Law 15/2012, because those are disputed measures), which
FTI projects to grow with inflation; and

Income tax: FTI projects future corporate income tax based on the tax code
in effect as of the Date of Assessment (incorporating future changes to the
tax code that had been announced as of the Date of Assessment).3%4

The Claimants’ expert then discounted these future cash flows to present value

on the Date of Assessment based on the Claimants’ PV facilities’ WACC of

5.5%.°%5 From this, FTI estimates that the loss in value of the Claimants’
investments to be €58.2 million.2%°

For the Actual Position, FTI used the arms’ length sales prices of the Claimants’
PV facilities. On 6 November 2015, Foresight 1’s_ subsidiary,
Foresight Netherlands Solar 1B.V., sold the Madridejos project for
€4.2 million.°°” In July 2016, Greentech became the sole owner of La Catilleja
when it acquired Foresight 2’s 49.97% shareholding in Global Litator, the owner
of La Catilleja, for €3.8 million. 99 On 28 September 2016, Greentech sold its
100% shareholding in the Fotocampillos project for €3.3 million, of which
€2.9 million represented consideration for Greentech’s equity. °° The
Claimants contend that these prices, adjusted to reflect the value on the Date
of Assessment, are a good indicator of the actual market value of those
investments at the time of sale.4

(iii) BDO’s first DCF valuation

The Tribunal now turns to the Respondent's valuations using the DCF method,
and the critiques raised by the Respondent of the Claimants’ primary DCF
model.

In its first report, the Respondent's expert, BDO, submitted a DCF valuation
which arrives at the surprising result that the disputed measures, despite
reducing the incentives paid to the Claimants’ PV facilities, actually led to an
increase in the value of the Claimants’ investments of approximately
€1.2 million, compared with FTI’s estimate of €58.2 million.4”'

Mr Edwards of FTI submitted the following illustration of the impact of BDO’s
different assumptions on his calculation of loss in his first report:4

Fits ‘capital losses taxrate

 

 

 

As can be seen in FT!’s illustration above, the difference between FTI’s and
BDO’s calculations is largely explained by the fact that BDO assumes that the
Claimants were only entitled in the Counterfactual Position to a “reasonable
rate of return” that would fluctuate with interest rates, rather than the fixed FiTs
specified in RD 661/2007.*°° Indeed, this assumption accounts for €34 million
(58%) of the difference between BDO'’s and FTI's valuations.“

As Mr Edwards states, “BDO’s assessment of loss does not assume that the
Claimants were entitled to the FiTs as set out in RD 661. Instead, it assumes
that Spain was entitled to amend the regulatory regime as long as the
Claimants were able to earn what Spain deems to be a ‘reasonable rate of
return’ on their investments.”4°

In BDO’s opinion, however, the Counterfactual Position must: “take into
account the adjustments required to ensure that the project returns for
producers of renewable energy tends to approach the returns demanded by
the market,” because it should “take into consideration that the premiums

126

(subsidies) to be received by operators in the renewable energy sector from
the date of analysis should not make it possible to obtain returns in excess of
reasonable returns.”40

499. BDO’s first DCF calculation not only assumes that investors were only ever
entitled to a “reasonable return” but also that the target return in the
Counterfactual Position is lower than in the Actual Position.*°” At the Hearing,
Mr Edwards stated:

So what does that mean? That means that BDO has essentially said, "You

were only ever entitled to earn less than you're currently entitled to earn, and

I'm going to work out what the value of your plants would have been with some

depressed feed-in tariffs that deliver a lower return, and I'm going to compare

it to what your plants are actually worth assuming a higher rate of return". So

once again, by assuming or by establishing that the appropriate rate of return

is lower than the rate of return implicit in the current regime, by definition, the

value of the plants is lower. Again, they didn't really have to do any of the DCF

modelling to establish that conclusion. They could simply have said: investors

were only ever entitled to earn a reasonable rate of return, that rate of return is

lower than the current return, so they've lost nothing. | mean, it's an obvious
conclusion based on the ingoing assumptions a second time.4°

500. Almost all (97%) of the remaining difference between FTI’s €58.2 million and

BDO’s €1.2 million valuation is attributable to: (i) BDO using a higher equity

value of the Claimants’ investments in the Actual Position (€16 million (27%) of

the difference);“°° and (ii) BDO excluding damages for losses prior to the Date

of Assessment, i.e. losses resulting from the disputed measures prior to the

New Regulatory Regime, e.g. the hours cap (RD 14/2010) and TVPEE

(Law 15/2012) (€8 million (13.5%) of the difference).41°
(iv) BDO’s revised DCF calculations

501. FTI’s calculation of a €58.2 million loss in the value of the Claimants’
investments is based on a DCF method that assumes the Claimants’ PV
facilities would have received the RD 661/2007 FiTs for their entire operating
life. In its second report, the Respondent's expert BDO submitted an
alternative DCF-derived valuation based on FTI’s approach to counterfactual
revenues but assuming that the Claimants’ PV facilities would receive the
RD 661/2007 FiTs for only the first 30 years of their operating life. The resulting

impact on the value of the Claimants’ investment ranged from a loss of €18
million to a gain of €5 million."

As Mr Edwards explained at the Hearing, the difference between FTI’s
valuation and BDO’s alternative valuation is mainly attributable to three major
differences of assumption.*1?

First, FT| assumes that the PV facilities have an operating life of 35 years
whereas BDO does not project cash flows beyond 30 years. ‘"? BDO’s
assumption reduces FTI’s estimate of loss by €11 million.

Second, BDO assumes a corporate income tax rate of 30% whereas FTI
assumes it was reduced to 28% in 2015 and 25% in 2016.** BDO's
assumption reduces FTI’s estimate of loss by €5 million.

The third and most significant difference is the much higher discount rate used
by BDO, which reduces FTI’s calculation of damages by around 60%, from
€44,7 million to €18.1 million.4*

(v) Tribunal’s analysis of the differences between FTI’s model
and BDO’s models

The Majority of the Tribunal is satisfied that FTI’s DCF model is generally
appropriate and should therefore provide the baseline for the Tribunal’s
assessment of damages in this case. However, the Majority of the Tribunal
shall now consider whether the particular assumptions used by FTI are
reasonable, or should be modified to reflect BDO’s criticisms.

In his second report, FTI’s Mr Edwards opined that the differences between
FTI’s primary valuation and BDO’s first DCF valuation were attributable to:
(i) counterfactual revenue forecasts; (ii) the value of the PV facilities in the
Actual Position; (iii) operative life of the PV facilities; (iv) historical losses; and
(v) corporate tax rate. In response to BDO’s supplemental report after the
Hearing, the Claimants contend that, when BDO adopts a similar counterfactual
revenue forecast to FTI’s using RD 661/2007 FiTs rather than a “reasonable

return”, the main difference between the Parties’ estimates is due to the
regulatory risk discount used by BDO.4"®

The Tribunal now turns to the Parties’ submissions on these points.
Counterfactual revenue forecasts

FTI’s primary DCF valuation forecasts revenues as a product of production
(which is based on average historical production) and fixed RD 661/2007 FiTs
for 35 years (which are forecast by updating the historical FiTs published by
the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism by CPI (less a factor)).4"7 By
contrast, BDO’s first DCF valuation assumes that the revenues generated by
the Claimants’ PV facilities would only give a set return on investment.*"® This
accounts for €34 million of the €59 million difference between the experts’
estimates of loss in their first reports.“

The Majority of the Tribunal considers that the assumption in FTI’s primary
model, also adopted in BDO’s revised DCF model, that the Claimants’ PV
facilities would receive the RD 661/2007 FiTs, is appropriate. This assumption
is consistent with the Majority’s finding on liability that the Respondent
abrogated the RD 661/2007 support scheme when it introduced the New
Regulatory Regime, in violation of Article 10(1) ECT.

Accordingly, the Majority of the Tribunal disregards BDO’s first DCF model,
which assumes that the Claimants were only ever entitled to a regulated rate
of return linked to the capital markets. The Majority of the Tribunal therefore
also disregards FTI’s alternative DCF valuation that forecasts counterfactual
revenues based on a reasonable rate of return rather than fixed FiTs under
RD 661/2007.“° The Majority of the Tribunal shall give further consideration
to BDO’s second DCF model, which assumes RD 661/2007 FiTs, in its
discussion below of the discount rate.

Actual value of PV facilities

FTI uses the arm’s length sales of the Claimants’ three PV facilities in 2015 and
2016 to assess the market value in the Actual Position of the Claimants’ equity
holdings.*?' BDO does not agree with this approach. Instead, BDO uses the
DCF method to arrive at an equity value of the Claimants’ PV facilities in the
Actual Position of €28.5 million.*?? BDO's approach results in a €16 million
reduction of the losses estimated by FTI.47°

The Majority of the Tribunal considers that the arm’s length transactions are
the best measure of market value in the Actual Position. The Majority also
lacks confidence in BDO’s approach, as there is a lack of consistency between
BDO’s DCF estimate (€28.5 million) and RAB estimate of €17.4 million of the
equity value of the Claimants’ investments.‘

Operating life

FTI assumes that the PV facilities have a 35-year operating life, based on an
European Commission study of the market for recycling PV panels, which
estimates that PV panels should operate for 30 to 40 years.##° FTI also notes
inter alia the statement of Mr Jamie Edwards of Foresight that: “there is no
reason to expect a well-built and well maintained solar plant will experience a
sudden drop in production or catastrophic failure.”426

In their second report, BDO perform an alternative DCF valuation that forecasts
RD 661/2007 FiTs for 30 years. BDO considers a 30-year useful life to be
appropriate based on the assumptions in the 2005 PER, which established the
FiTs under RD 661/2007, as well as the annual accounts and impairment tests
of the Claimants’ PV facilities.42”

In response, in FTI’s second report, Mr Edwards amended his model to assume
a useful life of 30 years, which reduces FTl’s assessment of loss by
approximately €11.2 million.47

The Tribunal observes that neither FTI nor BDO are experts on the useful life
of PV facilities. Based on the evidence in the record, the Majority of the Tribunal
considers that BDO’s assumption of a useful operating life of 30 years is more
reasonable than FTI’s assumption of 35 years. Accordingly, the Majority of the
Tribunal shall reduce its award of damages by €11.2 million to reflect the
difference between FTI’s and BDO’s operating life assumptions.

Historical losses

FTI opines that the disputed measures have affected cash flows of the
Claimants’ PV facilities since the start of 2011.79 However, BDO has not
undertaken an analysis of the impact of the disputed measures before the Date
of Assessment (30 June 2014).*° This is because BDO’s DCF methodology
for establishing the market value of the Claimants’ PV facilities in the
Counterfactual Position “entails establishing the premium needed from 2014
onwards for the Photovoltaic Plants to obtain project returns during the 30-year
useful life at the level of returns required by the capital[] markets.”49"

The Majority of the Tribunal observes that FTI has not provided a break-down
of historical losses caused by each disputed measure individually. But FTI has
calculated that the additional cash flows that the Claimants’ PV facilities would
have received in the Counterfactual Position prior to the Date of Assessment
amounted to €8 million“? Moreover, as part of the analysis of the discrepancy
between FTI’s primary DCF valuation and BDO’s first DCF calculation, FTI
opined that €8 million of the difference was attributable to BDO having
assumed no losses “[flor the period prior to the introduction of the current

the FET standard under Article 10(1) ECT until June 2014 when, as the Eiser
tribunal also concluded, “the prior regulatory regime was definitely replaced by
an entirely new regime”.*** As in Eiser, any award of damages by the Tribunal
must exclude the effects of the disputed measures prior to the New Regulatory
Regime on market value of the Claimants’ investments.**° The Majority of the
Tribunal shall dispose of this issue as part of its overall assessment of losses,
which is set out at the end of this section.

Corporate tax rates

At the Date of Assessment, the Spanish corporate tax rate was 30%.**° BDO’s
DCF model assumes that the tax rate on cash flows earned by the Claimants’
PV facilities remains at 30%. However, FTI’s model takes account of the
expectation at the Date of Assessment that the corporate tax rate would be
reduced to 28% in 2015 and 25% in 2016.8” BDO’s assumption of a consistent
30% rate reduces FTI’s estimate of loss by €5 million.“®

BDO acknowledges that the corporate income tax rate was in fact reduced in
November 2014, which is shortly after the Date of Assessment.*°° On balance,
the Majority of the Tribunal consider FTI’s assumption to be reasonable.

Spanish Electricity Sector risk

Whereas the Claimants contend that the disputed measures increased the
regulatory risk in the Actual Position, the Respondent contends that regulatory
risk actually decreased in the Actual Position and was higher in the
Counterfactual Position because, in BDO’s opinion:

[I]n a But-for scenario under which no control measures are applied and facing
an uncontrolled increase in the deficit, it is indisputable that premiums to
renewable energies would be reduced and, what's more, significantly.

Evidently, having rebalanced the Spanish Electricity System, this risk has been
reduced significantly.44°

BDO further opines that, in a Counterfactual Position without the disputed
measures, “an investor would have required a significant risk premium before
investing in the energy sector in Spain."“' BDO therefore adds a premium to
the cost of capital that FTI uses to discount future cash flows in the
Counterfactual Position to reflect this apparent risk that the SES would have
become unsustainable and the RD 661/2007 FiTs would therefore not have
been paid in the Counterfactual Position.

The Majority of the Tribunal cannot accept this contention. To do so would
require the Tribunal to conclude that Spain would not have been able to fund
the payment of the RD 661/2007 FiTs but for the disputed measures. But as
FTI opines, the disputed measures have not in fact materially impacted the
Spanish economy.*? As the Masdar tribunal held:

Respondent offered no valid explanation as to why regulatory risk would
decrease in the Actual scenario and increase in the But For scenario, other
than that the financial sustainability of the Spanish electricity system was at
risk prior to the enactment of the Disputed Measures and that, as evidenced
by rating agencies, this risk decreased once the measures were enacted. As
Claimant's expert testified at the Hearing, this reasoning is flawed. Accepting
Accuracy’s premise would require assuming that the Disputed Measures were
Respondent's only way to address the tariff deficit and that they did not only
contribute to the sustainability of the Spanish electricity system but to the
overall improvement in government finances that Respondent has experienced
since 2012.443

The Majority of the Tribunal also agrees with the Novenergia tribunal's
assessment that:

[I]t cannot be correct to assume a higher risk in a scenario where the regulatory
framework of the RE sector would have remained stable and RD 661/2007
would have continued to remain in force as originally implemented. The facts
of the case show that under the Special Regime, the Respondent managed to
attract numerous investors to the tune of billions of euros, indicating that the
tisk was considered low. Conversely, under the Specific Regime, it is not
reasonable to conclude that the risk is lower, especially considering that the
current remuneration system is subject to periodic reviews and the turmoil that
they have caused.‘44

In sum, the Majority of the Tribunal is satisfied that FTI’s approach to regulatory
risk is more reasonable than BDO’s, and that FTI’s discount rate of 5.5% should

not be increased.

In response to the Claimants’ cross-examination at the Hearing and
subsequent written request, ““° BDO submitted a supplemental report
containing a revised DCF model. This revised model was based on BDO’s
second DCF model, which assumes that the Claimants’ PV facilities would
receive RD 661/2007 FiTs for 30 years and includes a 5.74% regulatory risk
premium as part of the discount rate applied in the Counterfactual Position.*°
As requested by the Claimants, however, in its revised model BDO reduced the
risk premium from 574 basis points to 0 basis points.*4”

In the Majority of the Tribunal’s view, the revised model from BDO
demonstrates that the difference between the experts’ valuations when RD
661/2007 FiTs are assumed is largely attributable to the regulatory risk discount
used by BDO. When the regulatory risk discount in the Counterfactual Position
is removed, damages in BDO’s model are reduced by around 60%, from
€44,7 million to €18.1 million.“®

(vi) Tribunal’s assessment of loss

The Tribunal now arrives at its final assessment of the Claimants’ loss. As the
Eiser tribunal stated, “in a case of such scope and complexity damages cannot
be determined with mechanical precision.”"“? That being said, the Majority of
the Tribunal is confident that FTI’s primary DCF model is fundamentally sound
and requires only limited adjustment. Further, the Majority of the Tribunal
considers that the Claimants have satisfied their burden of proof.

In addition to its criticisms of FTI’s methodology and assumptions, the
Respondent has also raised more general objections to the Claimants’

damages claim.

First, the Respondent contends that the Claimants should not be awarded any
compensation because their PV facilities are “today highly profitable thanks to
the subsidies provided by the disputed measures, despite having low market,
production and cost risks.”°° In particular, the Respondent contends that the
Claimants have received a reasonable IRR of 8.6% pre-tax on their PV
facilities, which the Respondent contends compares favourably with the WACC.
of the renewable sector between 2013 and 2016.*' The Claimants contest the
Respondent's calculation, and submit that the IRRs in the Actual Position for
the Claimants’ PV facilities is 5.5% post-tax, which the Claimants contend is
materially below the 7% post-tax IRR that the Respondent claims was
considered a reasonable return when it set the RD 661/2007 FiTs.“?

The Tribunal need not resolve this particular disagreement between the
Parties. In the Majority of the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent's criticism that
the Claimants’ PV facilities may still generate a profit under the New Regulatory
Regime misses the point that the purpose of damages is to eliminate the
consequences of the Respondent’s breach of Article 10(1) ECT. The Majority
of the Tribunal has assessed these damages based on FTI’s primary DCF
valuation, subject to the adjustments that the Majority of the Tribunal has made.
On this basis, the Majority of the Tribunal is entirely satisfied that the Claimants
are in a worse position under the New Regulatory Regime than they would have
been had the Respondent not abrogated the RD 661/2007 regime. The
Claimants are therefore entitled to compensation for the Respondent's breach
of Article 10(1) ECT.

Second, the Respondent contends that the Claimants’ claim for €58.2 million
in compensation is disproportionate because the Claimants only invested
€25.8 million to acquire their PV facilities.6° Recognizing that the amount
historically invested is not directly relevant to a DCF valuation, the Respondent
submits that this sum is nevertheless relevant to assess the reasonableness of
a DCF outcome.‘

The Majority of the Tribunal agrees with the Eiser tribunal that the amount
invested can act as a “reality check” on the reasonableness of a damages
assessment.*®© In the Majority of the Tribunal’s view, however, the difference
between the Claimants’ quantum claim and the amounts they invested is
reasonable in the circumstances of this case. In particular, the Majority of the
Tribunal considers that the relevant comparison is the value of the Claimants’
equity at the time of the Respondent's breach, rather than at the time the
Claimants originally made their investment, which was several years earlier.
The Majority of the Tribunal accepts the Claimants’ contention that the value of
their equity “appreciated substantially between acquisition [in 2009-2010] and
2014, but for the disputed measures, as a result of declining interest rates, a
reduction in the corporate tax rate, and strong plant performance.”*°° The
Majority of the Tribunal does not consider the Claimants’ quantum claim to be
disproportionate.

The Tribunal has concluded that the disputed measures that preceded the New
Regulatory Regime did not violate the ECT. Itis therefore necessary to exclude
those earlier measures (RD 1565/2010, RDL 14/2010, RDL 2/2013) from the
assessment of the Claimants’ losses, which have been calculated as of the
Date of Assessment, 30 June 2014. The Tribunal has also held it does not
have jurisdiction over Law 15/2012 concerning the TVPEE, so this measure
must be excluded for the Tribunal’s assessment too.

Unhelpfully, the Claimants did not provide a breakdown of the individual impact
of each of the disputed measures.**” The Majority of the Tribunal has therefore
decided to exclude all historical losses from the Claimants’ damages claim to
reflect the fact that the disputed measures preceding the New Regulatory
Regime did not breach Article 10(1) ECT. This means that the Claimants’
valuation of losses shall be reduced by €8 million, which is the amount by which
the Claimants’ losses are reduced when FTI’s primary DCF valuation is
modified to exclude losses prior to the Date of Assessment.‘®°

The Majority of the Tribunal recognizes that the exclusion of all historical losses
may include certain losses prior to the Date of Assessment that are attributable

to the retroactive effect of the New Regulatory Regime. However, to the extent
that the Claimants receive less than full compensation as a result of the
exclusion of historical losses, this is a direct consequence of the Claimants’
decision, acknowledged at the Hearing,**? not to provide a break-down of
losses caused by each disputed measure individually, or caused by the New
Regulatory Regime in isolation.

Finally, as discussed above, the Majority of the Tribunal has also decided to
reduce the Claimants’ valuation of losses by a further €11.2 million to reflect
the assumption of a 30-year useful operating life of the Claimants’ PV facilities,
as opposed to the 35-year assumption in FTI’s primary model.

Accordingly, the Majority of the Tribunal determines that the Claimant is entitled
to an award of compensation in the amount of €39 million.

(vii) Interest

In their request for relief, the Claimants seek “pre- and post-award compound
interest at the highest lawful rate from the Date of Assessment until Spain’s full
and final satisfaction of the Award”. 4°

The Claimants have submitted two alternative interest claims, calculated using
either the Respondent's cost of borrowing (5-year Spanish government bonds
(0.4% to 1.4%)) or the Claimants’ cost of borrowing (Claimants’ cost of debt
(3.5% to 4.5%)).481

The Respondent contends that the 5-year Spanish government bond yield is
the appropriate interest rate because it reflects a “risk-free” rate. The
Respondent also contends that the Tribunal should not award post-award
interest at a higher rate than pre-award interest.*©2

The Tribunal observes that Article 10(1) ECT is silent on the awarding of
interest. Looking to investment treaty arbitration practice, the Majority of the
Tribunal is satisfied that interest should be awarded as part of the
compensation for the damages that the Claimants have suffered. As the Asian
Agriculture Products v. Sri Lanka tribunal stated, “interest becomes an integral

part of the compensation itself, and should run consequently from the date
when the State's international responsibility became engaged.”** Further, the
Majority of the Tribunal considers that compound interest is the generally-
accepted standard in international investment arbitration.

Having considered the Parties’ submissions, the Majority of the Tribunal adopts
the same approach as the tribunals in Eiser and Masdar, which awarded both
pre- and post-award interest, compounded monthly, but at a lower rate pre-
award, in order to “facilitate prompt payment”.4°°

Accordingly, the Majority of the Tribunal decides that the Respondent shall pay
interest from the Date of Assessment, 30 June 2014, to the date of this Award
at the rate of 1.4%, compounded monthly. From the date of this Award, the
Majority of the Tribunal decides that the Respondent shall pay interest at 3.5%,
compounded monthly, until payment has been made.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Pursuant to Article 43(1) of the SCC Rules, the Costs of the Arbitration consist
of: (i) the Fees of the Arbitral Tribunal; (ii) the Administrative Fee; and (iii) the
expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and the SCC.

139

554. Article 43(5) of the Rules provides that:

Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal shall, at the
request of a party, apportion the Costs of the Arbitration between the parties,
having regard to the outcome of the case and other relevant circumstances.
555. Pursuant to Article 43(6) of the Rules, the parties are jointly and severally liable
to the arbitrators and to the SCC to pay the Costs of the Arbitration.

556. On 29 October 2018, the Board of the SCC set the Costs of the Arbitration as
follows:

(a) The fees and expenses of Dr Michael Moser, Chairperson, amount to
€154,500 (fees), €7,862.87 (expenses), and €7,721.39 (per diem
allowance), in total €170,084.26.4

(b) The fees and expenses of Professor Dr Klaus Michael Sachs, Co-
Arbitrator, amount to €92,700 (fees), €868.95 (expenses), and
US$6,000 (per diem allowance), in total €93,568.95 and US$6,000.

(c) The fees and expenses of Dr Rat Emilio Vinuesa, Co-Arbitrator,
amount to €92,700 (fees), US$5,159.83 (expenses), and US$7,200
(per diem allowance), in total €92,700 and US$12,359.83.

(d) The Administrative Fee of the SCC amounts to €48,600 and
compensation for expenses €15,584.26, in total €64,184.26.

557. Value Added Tax must be added to the above amounts where applicable.
558. Further, Article 44 of the Rules provides that:

Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal may in the final
award upon the request of a party, order one party to pay any reasonable costs
incurred by another party, including costs for legal representation, having
regard to the outcome of the case and other relevant circumstances.
559. Each Party respectively seeks full reimbursement of their costs, fees and
expenses from the other Party. Given the Parties’ opposing positions on this

issue, the Tribunal must therefore decide how to apportion costs.

560. The Majority of the Tribunal has decided that the Respondent is liable to pay
the entire Cost of the Arbitration and the reasonable costs incurred by the

488 Dr Moser's expenses and per diem allowance have been reimbursed in advance by the SCC. For

the purposes of calculating the total Costs of the Arbitration, these sums (€7,862.87 (expenses);
€7,721.39 (per diem allowance)) are accounted for solely as expenses of the SCC, as set out in
paragraph 556(d).

140

Claimants. The Claimants have substantially prevailed in their claim on the

merits and were also successful in defeating the Respondent's primary

jurisdictional objection, which was briefed at length during the proceedings.

561. For these reasons, the Majority of the Tribunal considers it appropriate to award
to the Claimants the amount of €3,900,374.73 and US$2,997,596.33, which
includes the entire Cost of the Arbitration as determined by the SCC in the
amount of €404,953.21 and US$18,359.83.

x. AWARD

562. For the reasons stated in the body of this Award, the Tribunal decides:

Partial Dissenting Opinion
Co- Arbitrator Raul E. Vinuesa

I regret to dissent with my distinguished colleagues in reference to the applicable law
to the merits of the present dispute. I also disagree with the Majority of the Tribunal
conclusions concerning Claimants due diligence. Furthermore, I could not agree with
the Majority of the Tribunal conclusions regarding Respondent’s liability.

I. APPLICABLE LAW TO THE MERITS OF THE DISPUTE

1. Article 26(6) ECT provides that: “The Tribunal shall decide the issues in dispute in
accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of International Law”. As
already stated by the Tribunal “...the provisions of Article 26 ECT should be given their
ordinary meaning in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT”. |

2. The Tribunal has also affirmed that “...Contrary to the Respondent’s contention, Article
26(6) ECT applies to the merits of the case and not to jurisdiction... hod

3. Claimants alleged that EU law could not be considered as international law under Article
26 ECT.* They also alleged that the EU law is not applicable to the merits because all

claims in this arbitration are submitted based on ECT provisions.*

4. First of all, there is no reason to alleged that EU Law could not be considered as
international law. In that sense, following Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary, the tribunal
concluded, “...EU law is international law because it is rooted in international treaties”;
EU law “...forms part of the rules and principles of international law applicable to the

Parties’ dispute under Article 26(6) ECT”.®

5. Second, the applicable law to the merits does not depend on Claimants’ or Respondent’s
will. In the present case, the applicable law to the merits of the dispute has been pre-

determined by Contracting Parties to ECT as expressed in Article 26(6).

The Tribunal could not ignore the law it has to apply in accordance with art. 26(6) of ECT
only because Claimants claimed that alleged violations only concern a violation of ECT.
Claimants do not have the right to imposed restrictions on the applicable law to decide the

merits.

Quoting the Novenergia tribunal’, Claimants assume a false presumption taking for granted
that the present dispute does not concern matters, which are governed by EU law.
Considering that State aid under EU law has been argued by Respondent as part of the
applicable law under article 26(6)*; the Majority of the Tribunal could not avoid dealing
with Respondent’s allegations concerning the application of EU law in this arbitration.

In Electrabel v. Hungary, the tribunal stated, “...In the Tribunals’ view, the ECT and the
EC Treaty share the same broad objective in combating anti-competitive conduct. One of
the obligations undertaken by States under ECT was to protect investors, but another was
to combat anti-competitive conduct, as provided in Article 6 ECT.”®

Electrabel also stated that: “For all these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the
objectives of the ECT and EU law were and remained similar as regards anti-competitive
conduct, including unlawful State aid. Foreign investors in EU Member States, including
Hungary, cannot have acquired any legitimate expectations that the ECT would necessary
shield their investments from the effects of EU law as regards anti-competitive conduct.”"°

EU law and ECT are part of international law. Both legal systems have ruled on investment
protection. When in a particular case there is an overlap, it should prima facie be
understood that the ECT and EU rules are compatible and/or complementary to each other.
If there is an incompatibility in the application of one or the other, international law has its

own principles to settle such conflicts.

The possibility of conflicts between ECT and EU law allows presuming that the content
and scope of their particular rules, when referring to the same subject matter, may generate

contradictions. But, taking into account that legal certainty and legitimate expectations are
part of general principles of law under EU law, there is no real chance for contradiction
within the context of FET under ECT with general principles of law as applied under EU

law.

Therefore, EU Law, being part of rules and principles of international law, should be
applied to the merits of the present dispute.

Following Electrabel tribunal, it could be concluded that: “In summary, from whatever
perspective the relationship between the ECT and EU law is examined, the Tribunal
concludes that EU law would prevail over ECT in case of any material inconsistence: and
the Tribunal has concluded that non exists for the purpose of deciding the Parties dispute in
this arbitration”.""

From Electrabel conclusions, it could be confirmed that the ECT and EU Law did not have
a predetermined hierarchy between them within the literal context of Article 26(6).

In case of incompatibilities, the very content of the rules in conflict would determine the
criteria to be followed in order to decide which law must be applied to the particular
situation.

Finally, as an independent argument”, Claimants alleged that Article 16 ECT prevents the
terms of another treaty from being construed as to derogate from more favourable rights of
investors or their investments under Parts III or V ECT.

Article 16 ECT is not a reassurance for investors to deny the right to regulate of the
European Commission of the EU or its Member States. EC Decision on State aid of 10
November 2017 is the manifestation of a public policy binding on Member States, and all
other subjects subordinated to the European Union treaty system. Article 16 ECT could not -
be alleged as to circumvent an obligation binding on EU Member States, as well as on
Claimants as subject to EU law.

The EC Decision overrules the application of Article 16 ECT, due to the fact that it is a
special rule by which the EC has determined the legality of Spain’s new regulatory
measures, the same measures that have been challenged by Claimants.

The EC Decision has applied the principles of legal certainty and legitimate expectations
within the context of a general public policy concerning State Aid. The Majority of the
Tribunal has disregarded the content and scope of the EC Decision. They have not even
question the possibility of a conflict between FET principles under ECT with general
principles of law as applied by EU law.

The Majority of the Tribunal, when dealing with fair and equitable treatment under Article
10(1) ECT, overlooks to assess its compatibility with EU law in order to determine if there
was a conflict between the laws applicable to the merits of the dispute under Article 26(6)
ECT.

Whereas, it is reasonable to depart from a fair legal presumption in favour of a full
harmonization and compatibility of general principles of law, including legitimate
expectations as part of FET under ECT as well as under EU law; and whereas, EU law is
part of the law to be applied to the merits of this arbitration: I dissent with the Majority of
the Tribunal’s omission of a substantial part of the law it was obliged to observe in
conformity to Article 26(6) ECT.

In the consideration of the above, I disagree with the Majority of the Tribunal conclusion
that “...EC State Aid Decision has no bearing on the issue of Claimants’ legitimate
expectations of regulatory stability at the time of their investment”!? The Majority based its
conclusion considering that the EC Decision “...makes no assessment of the RD 661/2007
support scheme, under which Claimants made their investment”.'* The Majority is wrong

with the above reasoning.

From the mere analysis of the EC Decision dated 10 November 2017, it follows that the

Commission has made a comprehensive assessment of RD 661/2017.

The EC Decision has concluded that Spain’s New Regulatory Regime was in conformity
with EU law. On the basis of that conclusion, “...The Commission has assessed the
compensation that facilities receive under the scheme over the entire lifetime. For existing
facilities, this includes the payments received under the premium economic scheme. On the
basis of the aforementioned assessment, it has decided not to raise objections to the aid on

the grounds that it is compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article 107(3) (c)

TFEU.”'®

The EC Decision has also confirmed that “the scheme replaces and supersedes the
premium economic scheme (‘regimen econdmico primado’), which was governed by
Royal Decrees 661/2007 and1578/2008. Payments under the premium economic scheme
are covered by the decision in order to assess proportionality, ie. the absence of
overcompensation”.'® On that line, the Decision referred to the premium economic scheme
regulated by RD 661/2007'” reconfirming that “...the scheme supersedes and fully

replaces the premium economic scheme whose awards are absorbed.” '*

The Majority of the Tribunal has not taken into account that under EU law, “A measure
constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU if it is granted by a
Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or
threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of
certain goods [...] in so far as it affects trade between Member States”. '?

The reason of EC Decision is based on the confirmation that State aid has been ruled and
applied as part of a public policy within EU law. State aid granted without EC Commission
authorization is illegal. No legitimate expectations with regard to illegal State aid could be
recognized under EU law.

In the present case, Claimants have not even complied with an adequate due diligence

concerning the consequences of relying on an illegal State aid.

The EC Decision concluded that the New Regulatory Regime was not unlawful. As a
consequence of the above, Claimants’ claim that the New Regulatory Regime is illegal, is
fatally defeated.

Considering that Spain has in fact abrogated RD 661/2007 and replaced it with a new
regime, does not allow Claimants to automatically presume that the new regime violates a

fair and equitable treatment as recognized under international law, including ECT and EU
law.

In that context, “a reasonable rate of return” as determined through the new regime and
guaranteed by Spanish legislation, has been assessed by EC Decision: “The commission
has verified that the aid does not exceed what is required to recover the initial investment
costs and the relevant operational costs, plus a margin of reasonable rate of return, based
on the past and estimated costs and market prices (7.503% before tax for new facilities and
7,398 % for existing facilities. The rates appear to be in line with the rates of return of
renewable energy and high efficiency cogeneration projects recently approved by the
Commission and does not lead to overcompensation. During the regular revisions of the
compensation parameters, the payments to which each beneficiary is entitled in the future

are calculated to ensure a reasonable rate of return....””°

The EC also confirmed that, “In the present decision, the Commission has assessed the
measure notified by Spain (see section 2.1). It has therefore assessed whether existing
installations receive overcompensation for their entire period of life and has found that on
the basis of the total payments received under both schemes (the specific remuneration
scheme and the premium economic scheme) that is not the case, as explained above in
section 3.4.4. As Spain has decided to replace the premium economic scheme with the
notified aid measure it is not relevant for the scope of this decision to assess whether the
originally foreseen payments under the previous schemes would have been compatible or

not.” 21

The Majority of the Tribunal conclusions that investors, such as Claimants, could not have
expected that a reasonable rate of return would be limited to 7% or that the Special Regime
could be abolish ”” are not supported by the evidence. Under the domestic legal regime at
the time that Claimants invested in Spain, the State promise to secure a reasonable rate of
return did not depend upon the investors’ expectations, but on an objective criteria defined
by Law 54 of 1997: “...a reasonable rate of return with regard to the cost of money in the

capital market”.?>

The Majority of the Tribunal also omitted to take into consideration that, in accordance
with the case-law of the European Court of Justice, a recipient of State aid cannot, in
principle, have legitimate expectations in the lawfulness of aid that has not been notified to

the Commission.”*

Taking into account that subjects of the EU legal order include not only the EU Members,
but also their nationals”’; the European Court has found that a diligent businessman should
normally be able to determine whether that procedure [EC Commission procedures on

State aid authorizations] has been followed or not. 7°

For all the previous reasons, I am convinced that the EC Decision of 10 November 2017
has recognized and affirmed relevant legal issues that clearly determined the proper
standing of RD 661/2007 in relation to State aid. The simple reading of that EC Decision
confirmed that an assessment of RD 661/2007 support scheme has been properly done.

Claimants’ claims main objectives are based on the illegality of new measures affecting
RD 661/2007. As the European Commission has already considered (Decision on State
Aid of 10 November 2017) that the challenged new measures are legal measures within the
EU law, it follows that such modification is not unlawful.

For all previous reasons, I could not agree with the conclusion of the Majority of the
Tribunal that “...that EC State Aid Decision has no bearing on the issue of the Claimants’

legitimate expectations of regulatory stability at the time of the investment.”””_ ~

LACK OF CLAIMANTS DUE DILIGENCE

I also disagree with the Majority of the Tribunal conclusions on “due diligence” as

performed by Claimants at the time they made their investment.

Claimants, as sophisticated investors, have fail to command an adequate due diligence

exercise concerning Spanish Law and EU law on State aid. There is no question that due

diligence is a prerequisite for the viability of a legitimate expectation’s claim.

The evidence confirmed that Claimants failed to procure an adequate due diligence
assessment, concerning not only the evolution of Spanish performance on State aid and on
State’s subsidies, but also on the content and scope of EC regulations. Moreover,
considering that Claimants have invested in such a highly regulated activity, as the one

they have invested.

Taking into account that none of the due diligence reports submitted by the Claimants
contain an analysis of the Spanish legal framework surrounding RD 661/2007, the Tribunal
has confirmed that, “...In the Tribunal’s view, the Garrigues report is in fact rather vague
on the issue...”*°, To my understanding, the above Majority of the Tribunal assumption,
could not reasonable allow to conclude that Claimants behaved diligently.

Claimants never commissioned a due diligence assessment on Spanish legal system. They
also have ignored that subsidies to renewables were incentives subject to State aid under
UE law. Under EU Law, subsidies to renewables constitute State aid.”®

Evidence shows that they have commissioned no due diligence on Spanish as well as on
EU law. At the Hearing, Claimants witnesses acknowledged that the Garrigues
memorandums regarding Castilleja Project, were not commissioned by Claimants but by
the seller of the projects to the Claimants.*°

Taking into account the evidence produced during the present proceedings, I could not
share the inference made by the Majority of the Tribunal that, “...Nevertheless, the
Tribunal considers that It is reasonable for an investor to assume that its legal advisors
would have raised a red flag had they detected any risk of fundamental change to the
regulatory regime.”?!

On the same line of reasoning, I could not share the Majority of the Tribunal assumption
that “...Further the Tribunal considers that a reqsonable investor would have not
interpreted the Spanish Supreme Court jurisprudence concerning modifications to early

support schemes as a warning that Spain had the power to abrogate RD 661/2007 and

replaced it with a radically different support scheme..."

The above assumptions are mere speculations without legal support. Therefore, Claimants’
have not proved that they complied with an adequate due diligence process as to justify the

reasonability of their alleged legitimate expectations.

From 2005 and on, Spanish courts’ constant jurisprudence have established a clear legal
framework assuming that “...Producers do not have an unmodifiable right that the
economic scheme which regulates modifications to premiums will stay the same...”.°?
Since them, Spanish courts have constantly referred to Law 54 of 1997 in order to assure
that any regulatory modification on the electricity sector, would guaranty a reasonable rate
of return to producers. In the present case, it has been proved that the Claimants’
investments continue to obtain a reasonable rate of return as established under the legal

framework in force at the time the investments were made.

Spanish Supreme Court has confirmed that, “Companies that freely decide to enter a
market such as electricity generation under the special regime, knowing that it is largely
dependent on the setting of economic incentives by public authorities, are or should be
aware that they may be modified within legal guidelines by those same authorities. One of
the “regulatory risks” to which they submit and which they must take into account is
precisely the variations of parameters for premium or incentives, something which, the

electricity sector limits, as previously discussed, but does not preclude”**

Whereas, the constant jurisprudence of Spanish Courts has clearly determined the general
legal framework of electricity generation under special regime, there is no reasonable
justification for Claimants’ negligent behaviour. As the Blusun tribunal has confirmed:
“.,.investors like anyone else have access to independent advise. If it avoids outright

misrepresentation, the Government does not offer warranties in that regard.”°°

Therefore, I could not agree with the Majority of the Tribunal’s assumptions concerning

Claimants’ due diligence.oversights and omissions.

In conclusion, and for all the above reasons, I dissent with the Majority of the Tribunal
with the law as applied to the merits, with the Majority of Tribunal conclusions on
Claimants due diligence and as a consequence of that, I disagree with the Majority of the
Tribunal findings on Respondent’s liability.

Furthermore, and in conformity with the essential principle contained in the classic notion

of an illegal act’; in the present case, the inexistence of a violation attributable to

 

Respondent, determines the inexii of an obligation to repair hypothetical d: As
a consequence, of the above, I dissent with arguments and conclusions of the Majority of
the Tribunal in respect of the allocations of damages, interests and costs to Respondent.
