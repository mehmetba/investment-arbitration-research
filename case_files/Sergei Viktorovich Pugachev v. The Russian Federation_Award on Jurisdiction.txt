L INTRODUCTION

1. This Arbitration concerns the disputes between Mr. Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev
(“Claimant”) and the Russian Federation (“Respondent” and together with Claimant, the
“Parties”) for alleged breaches of the Agreement Between the Government of the French
Republic and the Government of the United Soviet Socialist Republics on the Reciprocal
Promotion and Protection of Investments dated July 4, 1989 (the “BIT” or the “Treaty’).

 

2. The Parties’ disputes broadly relate to Respondent’s alleged breaches of its international
obligations under the Treaty to afford a fair and equitable treatment, full protection and
security and not to expropriate assets in relation to five alleged investments of Mr.
Pugachev:

a. A project to renovate and redevelop certain historic buildings adjoining the Red
Square in Moscow into a luxury hotel and high-end residential complexes (the “Red
Square Project”);

b. CJSC Enisey Production Company, a company which owned a licence for the
exploitation of the Elegest Plateau of the Ulug Khemsky coal basin in Tuva, and the
development of the coal mine, including a project of constructing a railway to
transport the mined coking coal (“EPC”);

c. OAO Northern Shipyard or “Severnaya Verf” (the “Northern Shipyard”), OAO
Baltic Shipyard or “Baltiysky Zavod” (the “Baltic Shipyard”) and OAO Iceberg
Central Design Office or Central Design Bureau Iceberg (the “Iceberg Shipyard”
and together with the Northern Shipyard and the Baltic Shipyard the “Shipyards”
or “Shipyard Interest”);

d. A number of land plots located in the Krasnogorsky District of the Moscow Region
(the “Land Plots”); and

e. Other investments outside the Russian Federation (the “Non-Russian
Investments”).

3. In the appropriate procedural opportunity, Respondent requested to bifurcate these
proceedings in accordance with the procedural calendar established in Scenario 3 of Annex
1 to Procedural Order No. | (“POI”). Claimant requested the Tribunal to dismiss
Respondent’s request for bifurcation in its entirety. Having carefully examined the
arguments put forward by both Parties, on 22 December 2017, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 3 (“PO3”) ordering the bifurcation of the Arbitration.

4. During the jurisdictional phase of the Arbitration, both Parties submitted multiple
allegations as to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the dispute. Accordingly, in the present
Award on Jurisdiction the Tribunal will decide, inter alia, whether or not Claimant: (i) is
an “investor” in accordance with the Treaty; (ii) made protected investments in the Russian

Federation; and (iii) whether or not Claimant satisfied the procedural requirements set forth
under Article 7 of the Treaty.

For the reasons set out in this Award on Jurisdiction, the majority of the Tribunal finds that
(i) the Treaty requires Claimant to have held French nationality at the time he made his
alleged investments; and (ii) that Claimant did not hold French nationality at the date of all
of his alleged investments. Accordingly, in the operative part of this Award on Jurisdiction,
the majority of the Tribunal will declare that it does not have jurisdiction over the present
dispute because Mr. Pugachev is not an “investor” in accordance with the Treaty. In
consequence, the majority of the Tribunal will dismiss all of Claimant’s claims.

In the following Sections of this Award on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal summarizes the
procedural background of the Arbitration (Section II) and the arguments put forward by
both Parties in their submissions (Section III). Afterwards, the Tribunal sets forth its
analysis and considerations (Section IV), decides on the costs of the Arbitration (Section
V), and provides its decision (Section VI).

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

Claimant served a Notice of Arbitration dated 21 September 2015 (the “Notice of
Arbitration”) on Respondent pursuant to Article 7 of the Treaty and the 1976 Arbitration
Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (the “UNCITRAL
Rules”).

Pursuant to Article 3(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, and as confirmed in paragraph 2.3 of the
Terms of Appointment dated | March 2017 (the “TOA”), these arbitration proceedings are
deemed to have commenced on 22 September 2015, the date on which Respondent received
the Notice of Arbitration.

Claimant initiated the proceedings in the present arbitration represented by the French law
firm Lazareff— Le Bars. Respondent was represented by itself at the beginning.

By letter dated 17 June 2016 (received by Respondent on 21 June 2016), Claimant appointed
Professor Thomas Clay, a French national, as the first arbitrator pursuant to Article 7(1) of
the UNCITRAL Rules.

In the same letter dated 17 June 2016, Claimant proposed that the Secretary General of the
Permanent Court of Arbitration (the “PCA”) act as appointing authority in this Arbitration.
By letters dated 9 and 10 August 2016, Respondent agreed to the PCA Secretary General
acting as appointing authority in this Arbitration.

On 19 August 2016, the Secretary General of the PCA appointed Dr. Bernardo
M. Cremades, a Spanish national, as the second arbitrator pursuant to Article 7(2)(b) of the
UNCITRAL Rules.

On 19 September 2016, the two Arbitrators having failed to reach an agreement on the
chairman within the time limit, Claimant asked the PCA to appoint the chairman.

On 24 October 2016, The Respondent informed that it would now be represented by the
international law firm, White & Case.

On 31 October 2016, the Secretary General of the PCA appointed Dr. Eduardo Zuleta
Jaramillo, a Colombian national, as the presiding arbitrator pursuant to Article 7(3) of the
UNCITRAL Rules, as modified by agreement of the Parties.

On 9 November 2016, the Tribunal ordered the Parties to refrain from making public
statements or disclosing any information related to this Arbitration during their discussions
on procedural matters, including the applicable confidentiality rules.

By letter dated 14 December 2016, Claimant informed the Tribunal and Respondent that he
would henceforth be represented only by the French law firm Betto Seraglini. Claimant
enclosed a Power of Attorney, dated 12 December 2016.

On 19 December 2016, Claimant submitted the Request for Interim Measures. As part of
its Request for Interim Measures, Claimant sought a Preliminary Order (the “First
Preliminary Application”).

On 27 December 2016, Respondent submitted its Response to Claimant’s First Preliminary
Application (the “Response to the First Preliminary Application”).

On 4 January 2017, the Tribunal issued its Decision on the First Preliminary Application
(the “First Preliminary Application Decision”), rejecting Claimant’s request.

On 8 January 2017, Claimant submitted a Second Application for a Preliminary Order (the

“Second Preliminary Application”).

On 10 January 2017, Respondent replied to the Second Preliminary Application (the
“Response_to_ the Second Preliminary Application”). Respondent submitted further
information regarding the Second Preliminary Application in a letter dated 12 January 2017,

to which Claimant replied on 14 January 2017.

On 20 January 2017, the Tribunal issued its Decision on the Second Preliminary Application

(the “Second Preliminary Application Decision”) rejecting (i) Claimant’s Second
Preliminary Application, and (ii) Claimant’s request for the Tribunal to revisit its Decision
on the First Preliminary Application issued on 4 January 2017.

On 10 February 2017, Respondent filed its Response to the Request for Interim Measures

(the “Response to Claimant’s Request for Interim Measures” or “Response to Request
for Interim Measures”).

On the same date, Respondent submitted to the Tribunal its Security for Costs Application
(the “Respondent’s Security for Costs Application”).

On 1 March 2017, the Tribunal issued the TOA. Pursuant to paragraph 6.1 of the TOA, the
place of the Arbitration is Madrid, Spain.

On the same date, the Tribunal issued PO1. As per the Tribunal’s order dated 9 November
2017, Article 10.5 of POI provides that the Parties shall refrain from making any public
statements or disclosures that undermine the integrity and efficiency of this Arbitration,
including the disclosure of any confidential material submitted by either Party as part of this
arbitral proceeding.

By letter dated 3 March 2017, Claimant raised to the attention of the Tribunal that
Respondent had allegedly breached the confidentiality provisions contained in Article 10 of
PO1 by publishing a press release related to the Arbitration on the website of the Russian
Federation’s Public Prosecutor.

On the same date, Respondent informed the Tribunal of a series of public statements, press
releases, and interviews made by Claimant related to the Arbitration, allegedly in breach of
the Tribunal’s order of 9 November 2017 and POI.

By email dated 3 March 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on each other’s
letter sent on that same date.

On 8 March 2017, Claimant responded to Respondent’s letter dated 3 March 2017 opposing
it and requesting the Tribunal to order Respondent to refrain from making future
communications that undermine the efficiency and integrity of this Arbitration.

On the same date, Respondent commented on Claimant’s letter dated 3 March 2017
opposing it and seeking an additional relief by way of a Partial Award.

On 10 March 2017, Claimant submitted its Reply to Respondent’s Security for Costs
Application (the “Reply to Respondent’s Security for Costs Application”).

On 13 March 2017, Claimant brought to the attention of the Tribunal a letter received on 8
March 2017 from the law firm Hogan Lovells in London on behalf of the Deposit Insurance
Agency (the “DIA”). Claimant alleged that this letter requested Claimant’s counsel to
disclose information covered by the attorney-client privilege.

On 16 March 2017, Respondent responded to Claimant’s letter dated 13 March 2017 and
requested the Tribunal to reject all of Claimant’s requests.

On 17 March 2017, the Tribunal reiterated that the place of the arbitration is Madrid, Spain,
but that, pursuant to Section 6.2 of the TOA and Section 1.1 of PO1, the hearings may be
held in other locations. The Tribunal considered all arguments put forward by the Parties,
particularly in the submissions of 3 March 2017 and 8 March 2017, as to the appropriate
venue for the upcoming hearing, and decided to hold a hearing on 17 April 2017 in Paris,
France exclusively devoted to Claimant’s Request for Interim Measures (the “Hearing on
Interim Measures”), and to reserve 18 April 2017 if needed. The Tribunal established that
the aforesaid decision only applied for the Hearing of Interim Measures and shall not be
construed in any way as a ruling on the location of any future hearing in this Arbitration, or
as a judgment on the merits of any of the applications put forward by the Parties in their
submissions.

by the confidentiality obligations provided for under POI and, accordingly, they could not
hold press conferences, issue statements to the press, or the likes, related to this Arbitration.!

Interim Measures, Respondent’s Security for Costs, applications on confidentiality, and any

other interim measure. In this regard, the Tribunal noted that it would only receive
additional submissions from the Parties with prior authorization from the Tribunal in the
event that something new and urgent arose.”

On 20 April 2017, Respondent submitted an application alleging further breaches by
Claimant of POI and of the orders made by the Tribunal during the Hearing on Interim
Measures. On 24 April 2017, Claimant submitted its comments to Respondent’s application.

On 29 April 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide additional comments and
information concerning the alleged breaches of PO1. As requested by the Tribunal,
Respondent submitted its comments on 4 May 2017, and Claimant responded on 9 May
2017.

On 26 May 2017, the Tribunal sent a letter to the Parties whereby (i) it ordered specific
measures in order to preserve the integrity and efficiency of the arbitration, and (ii) it
submitted a proposal to the Parties to balance confidentiality and transparency concerns in
this Arbitration (the “26 May 2017 Order’). The Tribunal invited the Parties to submit
joint or separate comments to the proposal on or before 5 June 2017.

On 6 June 2017, Respondent submitted its comments to the proposal put forward by the
Tribunal and alleged that Claimant breached the specific orders made in the 26 May 2017
Order. Accordingly, Respondent requested the Tribunal to take such steps as it considers
necessary to ensure Claimant’s compliance with its orders, including in particular the 26
May 2017 Order. In addition, Respondent expressed the view that, until Claimant indicates
a willingness to comply with the Tribunal’s orders in this Arbitration, it should not be
required to incur further time and expense in defending itself, including in relation to
agreeing on logistics for the publications of documents relating to the arbitration.

On 9 June 2017, Claimant responded to Respondent’s letter dated 6 June 2017. Claimant
stated that he has complied with the 26 May 2017 Order and removed 103 pages from his
website that contained publications concerning this Arbitration. Claimant argued that
Respondent failed to point out to any article, post or any publication, for the simple reason
that Claimant removed from his website all articles and publications as per Tribunal’s
direction. Claimant urged this Tribunal to (i) acknowledge that Claimant has complied with
the 26 May 2017 Order; (ii) order full transparency, in exchange for its extremely strict
confidentiality provision; and (iii) decide on the entity that should be designated to
administer the website in order to avoid further obstructive attitude from Respondent in that
respect.

On 12 June 2017, Respondent submitted a letter to the Tribunal alleging Claimant’s further
breaches of the 26 May 2017 Order. Respondent maintained that, in breach of the 26 May
2017 Order: (i) as of 2 June 2017, multiple publications and documents with respect to the
Arbitration had not been removed from Claimant’s website; (ii) it was only after
Respondent’s letter dated 6 June 2017 that Claimant started to remove such materials; and

(iii) that, as of 12 June 2017, a number of such materials remain on Claimant’s website.
Respondent repeated its request made in its letter dated 6 June 2017, i.e. that the Tribunal
take whatever measures it deems necessary to ensure Claimant’s compliance with its orders.

On 12 June 2017, the Tribunal, after carefully reviewing the multiple applications and cross-
applications submitted by the Parties related to alleged breaches of the confidentiality orders
and the additional relief sought, informed the Parties that such matters addressed several
issues that needed to be resolved in the context of the Request for Interim Measures and
Respondent’s Security for Costs Application. However, the Tribunal noted that, despite the
fact that the proceedings were closed during the Hearing of Interim Measures, the Parties
continued submitting additional applications and cross-applications on these matters, the
last one filed on 12 June 2017. Hence, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would not
issue an interim award by 17 June 2017 but during the last days of June or the first days of
July.

On 13 June 2017, the Tribunal requested the Parties to submit any objection on or before
14 June 2017 to the Tribunal’s understanding of the procedural timetable and the resulting
dates of issuance of the interim award. Neither Party submitted any objection to this effect.

On 7 July 2017, the Tribunal issued an interim award (“Interim Award”) within the time
limits agreed upon by the Parties, in regard to an extradition request formulated by the
Russian Federation to France (“France Extradition Request”). In its decision, the Tribunal
ordered Respondent to take all necessary actions to suspend the France Extradition Request
and to abstain from initiating any future extradition request to France. The Tribunal denied
all other claims and applications and ordered each Party and respective counsels to refrain
from making public statements about any fact regarding this Arbitration.

On the same date, 7 July 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (“PO2”)
maintaining the confidentiality provisions of PO1 with respect to the documents that are not
Available Documents.

On 29 September 2017, Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim (“Claimant’s
Statement of Claim’).

On 30 October 2017, Respondent sent a letter to the Tribunal attaching its Request for
Bifurcation (“Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation”), together with Legal Exhibits RL-
61 to RL-91 and Factual Exhibits R-54 to R-59.

On 10 November 2017, Respondent sent a letter to the Tribunal referring to (i) the Interim
Award, (ii) PO2, (iii) the Tribunal’s letter of 2 August 2017, and (iv) Claimant’s statement
of 3 August 2017 which addressed the removal of posts and publications concerning the
Arbitration from his website. Additionally, Respondent referred to its letter of 2 November
2017 regarding Claimant’s non-compliance with the Tribunal’s instructions on
confidentiality. Respondent stated that, as Claimant failed to respond to such letter, he (i)
failed to comply with the Tribunal’s instructions regarding confidentiality made in the
Interim Award and PO2; (ii) submitted a wholly incorrect statement regarding his
compliance with the Tribunal’s request; and (iii) breached the Tribunal’s order to refrain

from making public statements in the press. Respondent concluded by requesting the
Tribunal to consider applicable sanctions to Claimant.

On 27 November 2017, Claimant submitted his Observation on Respondent’s Request for
Bifurcation (the “Claimant’s Observations on Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation”).

On 22 December 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (“PO3”) ordering the
bifurcation of the proceedings.

On 18 January 2018, the Tribunal sent a letter to the Parties requesting Claimant to submit,
on or before 20 January 2018, a letter or memorial: (i) identifying the extracts from the
Statements of Claim he purported to disclose; (ii) substantiating his request to disclose
pursuant to the criteria set forth in PO2; and (iii) clarifying whether the disclosed extracts
from the Statement of Claim will remain confidential if submitted before the French civil
proceedings, or whether it would, therefore, become public by virtue of it being provided
in those proceedings.

On 20 January 2018, Claimant submitted a letter to the Tribunal in reference to the
Tribunal’s letter of 18 January 2018 with respect to Claimant’s request to produce extracts
of the Statement of Claim in the French civil proceedings. Claimant clarified that the request
had a very limited scope, only seeking to avoid contradicting findings and decisions of the
Tribunal and of the parallel proceedings worldwide.

On 22 January 2018, Respondent sent a letter to the Tribunal referring to Claimant’s letter
of 20 January 2018, stating its disagreement with Claimant’s request for permission to
disclose extracts of the Statement of Claim, and noting that the said request was not
submitted before the French court in a timely fashion. In Respondent’s view, the said delay
in submitting the request is evidence that such request is not central to Claimant’s case.

On 26 January 2018, Respondent sent a letter to the Tribunal referring to the Statement of
Claim and its exhibits, as well as the Tribunal’s decision in PO3 to bifurcate the
proceedings. In this letter, Respondent requested Claimant to provide a series of documents
by 1 February 2018.

On 7 February 2018, Respondent sent a letter to the Tribunal bringing to its attention that
Claimant has failed to respond to any of its requests and requesting the Tribunal to order
Claimant to provide the documents and confirmations as listed in its letter.

On 12 February 2018, Claimant responded to the Tribunal’s letter of 7 February 2018
related to Respondent’s request for disclosure documents. Claimant urged the Tribunal to
deny Respondent’s request as it aimed to unilaterally amend the arbitral proceedings.
Claimant noted that the document production phase was to occur between 13 July and 7
September 2018, and that there was no reason to change such dates. In Claimant’s view, the
only way to preserve the equality of arms and due process is to keep the arbitral procedure
as agreed by the Parties and to respect the agreed-upon phases, their times and dates.

On 14 February 2018, Respondent sent a letter to the Tribunal stating that Claimant cannot
cherry-pick certain pages of documents for exhibition when those pages are unhelpful to
Claimant’s case. Respondent stated that the Parties have an obligation to cooperate in good
faith in the process of gathering and providing evidence to the Tribunal; failure to disclose
or produce evidence entitles the Tribunal to draw an adverse inference in respect of such
evidence.

On 16 February 2018, Claimant sent a letter to the Tribunal responding to Respondent’s
request for disclosure of documents of 14 February 2018. In the view of Claimant,
Respondent’s request disregards the Tribunal’s orders and instructions, as well as the
content of POI, which addresses all matters pertaining to the taking of evidence and the
document production phase of the Arbitration. Claimant invited the Tribunal to refuse
Respondent’s request.

On 5 April 2018, Claimant submitted Fabienne Jault-Seseke’s First Expert Report (“First
Expert Report of Professor Jault-Seseke”).

On 6 April 2018, Respondent submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction (the “Respondent’s
Submission on Jurisdiction”), as well as Sergey Aleksandrovich Belov’s First Expert
Report (“First Expert Report of Mr. Belov”).

On 20 July 2018, Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (“Claimant’s
Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction’).

On 3 August 2018, Respondent submitted its Request for Production of Documents
(“Respondent’s Request for Production of Documents”). On the same date, Claimant
submitted its Request for Production of Documents (““Claimant’s Request for Production
of Documents”).

On 12 September 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (“PO4”) (i) ordering
Respondent to produce certain documents as provided for in Claimant’s Redfern Schedule,
(ii) ordering Claimant to produce certain documents as provided in Respondent’s Redfern
Schedule; (iii) rejecting the Parties’ request to produce certain documents as provided for
in the terms of the Redfern Schedules; (iv) ordering the Parties to produce the documents
ordered by the Tribunal in the Redfern Schedules; and (v) reserving the power to request
the Parties to produce additional documents.

On 19 November 2018, Respondent sent a letter to the Tribunal referring to POI and PO4,
disputing the authenticity and/or completeness of certain documents submitted by Claimant.
Respondent noted that the Tribunal has the competence to decide on the authenticity of the
Disputed Documents, as well as the power to request the production of legible and complete
copies of the final versions of the Disputed Documents.

On 30 November 2018, Claimant sent a letter to the Tribunal in response to Respondent’s
letter of 19 November 2018 and emails from 20 and 21 November 2018. Claimant noted
that the documents that Respondent requested were already in its possession as they were
almost exclusively created by Respondent itself. Claimant stated that Respondent has the

burden of proving that its concerns as to the authenticity of the Disputed Documents are
justified. In its letter, Claimant requested the Tribunal to dismiss Respondent’s request.

On 17 December 2018, Respondent submitted the Supplementary Expert Report of Sergey
Aleksandrovich Belov (the “Second Expert Report of Mr. Belov”). On the same date,
Claimant submitted the Second Expert Report of Professor Jault-Seseke (the “Second

Expert Report of Professor Jault-Seseke”).

On 18 December 2018, Respondent submitted (i) Professor Roman Sergeevich Bevzenko’s
First Expert Report (the “First Expert Report of Professor Bevzenko”), and (ii) the First
Witness Statement of Dimitry Sergeevich Rybakov (the “First Witness Statement of Mr.
Rybankov’”).

On 19 December 2018, Respondent submitted its Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction (the
“Respondent’s Reply on Jurisdiction”).

On 11 February 2019, Claimant sent a letter to the Tribunal in response to its letter of 4
February 2019 and its invitation for additional comments by the Parties on the new Hearing
dates. Claimant requested the Tribunal to issue an order on interim measures under Article
26 of the UNCITRAL Rules to preserve Claimant’s rights until the Decision on Jurisdiction
is rendered. Claimant noted that, due to the circumstances that surround the case, any delays
in the Arbitration were financially and morally detrimental exclusively to Mr. Pugachev.

On 19 February 2019, Respondent sent a letter to the Tribunal referring to Claimant’s letter
of 11 February 2019 making an application for interim measures. Respondent requested the
Tribunal to dismiss Claimant’s petition, arguing that there has been no material change in
circumstances to justify such an application.

On 5 March 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 (“PO5”), rejecting
Claimant’s request for interim measures as submitted in Claimant’s Application.

On 26 March 2019, Claimant submitted his Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (“Claimant’s

Rejoinder on Jurisdiction”).

On 17 May 2019, the Tribunal submitted a series of questions to the Parties (the

“Tribunal’s Questions”).

On 1 July 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 (“POG”), establishing the
procedural timetable in its Annex 1.

On 19 July 2019, Claimant submitted his answer to the Tribunal’s Questions (“Claimant’s
Answers to the Tribunal’s Questions”) and Respondent submitted its answers to the
Tribunals Questions (“Respondent’s Answers to the Tribunal’s Questions”).

On 26 July 2019, the Tribunal sent a letter to the Parties pursuant to PO! and PO6, with the
proposed agenda for the hearing on jurisdiction of 12-17 November 2019.

On 29 August 2019, the Tribunal sent a letter to the Parties setting forth the agenda for the
pre-hearing organizational conference call to be held between the Parties and the Tribunal
on 4 September 2019.

On 29 September 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 (“PO7”), establishing
the time and place of the hearings on jurisdiction to be held on 12 November 2019 (the
“Hearing on Jurisdiction”), as well as all details related to it. PO7 included the
identification of the witnesses summoned for cross-examination, the order of examination
of witnesses, the Tribunal’s summon of additional witnesses, the list of the attendees to the
Hearing on Jurisdiction, among other issues.

On 4 October 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 (“PO8”) allowing the
Parties to include additional witnesses in the hearing, in the interest of guaranteeing
procedural equality. The Tribunal further instructed that any additional contact,
communication and engagement by either Party with the additional witnesses is to be made
in writing with the Tribunal’s authorization; and the other Party is to receive a copy of such
communication.

By letter dated 4 October 2019, Claimant’s counsel informed the Tribunal and Respondent
of a change in the composition of its team, as well as of its name to Betto Perben Pradel
Filhol.

On 27 April 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 9 (““PO9”), declaring the closing
of the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration and inviting the Parties to make their
presentations of costs.

On 15 May 2020, each Party submitted their presentations of costs to the Tribunal
(“Claimant’s Presentation of Costs” and “Respondent’s Presentation of Costs”).

     

On 19 May 2020, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Parties’ correspondence and
requested Claimant to clarify the scope of his presentation of costs and certain related
matters.

On 22 May 2020, Claimant submitted his clarification to Claimant’s Presentation of Costs
pursuant to the Tribunal’s instructions.

THE PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS

The Tribunal summarizes below the position of the Parties regarding the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. The Tribunal has taken into consideration all the arguments and evidence
submitted by the Parties. The fact that an argument or a specific piece of evidence is not
mentioned in the summary does not mean that the Tribunal has not considered it.

Respondent’s Position

Respondent advanced four objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to hear Claimant’s
claims, asserting that anyone of such objections is capable of disposing of all, or a material
part of the entire case.* Respondent highlighted that it is Claimant who has the burden of
proving that the Tribunal has jurisdiction, which, it argues, Mr. Pugachev has failed to do.‘

In the view of Respondent:°

a

Claimant is not an “investor” in accordance with Article 1.2 of the BIT; consequently,
the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae;

b

Claimant’s claims are abusive because Mr. Pugachev sought to artificially acquire
French nationality, with the sole purpose of gaining access to international arbitration
under the BIT;

c

The DIA’s actions are not attributable to Respondent, and the DIA is not a contracting
party under the BIT; and

d) Claimant failed to comply with the mandatory pre-conditions for arbitration as
established in Article 7 of the BIT.

96. The Tribunal summarizes the main aspects of Respondent’s arguments below.
a) The definition of “investor” under the BIT

97. Respondent argues that Claimant bears the burden of proving that it complies with the
definition of “investor” in order to have access to international arbitration under the BIT.°
In this case, the Russian Federation asserts that Mr. Pugachev has not discharged such
burden, as he has failed to prove (1) that he validly acquired French nationality in
accordance with French law; (2) that the BIT is applicable to him as a holder of dual
nationality (i.e., French and Russian); (3) that his dominant and effective nationality is
French and not Russian; and (4) that he held French nationality at the relevant times for
application of the BIT (i.e., at the time of the making of the investment, at the time of
occurrence of the alleged breaches of the BIT, and at the time of the introduction of the
arbitral proceedings).”

I. The validity of Claimant’s acquisition of French nationality

98. Respondent states that Claimant did not comply with the mandatory requirements for
acquiring nationality through naturalisation under French Law, “notwithstanding the
French authorities’ decision to naturalise him” § It argues that the Tribunal is competent to
independently determine? — for the purposes of this Arbitration — whether or not Mr.
Pugachev has French nationality, in accordance with French law.'° The Russian Federation
highlights that the Tribunal has the power to disregard any nationality documents, as they
merely constitute prima facie evidence; in its view, Claimant acquired French nationality
either by error or fraud.!!

99. According to Respondent, under French law, foreigners can acquire French nationality
through the process of naturalisation.'? Both the process and the requirements are set out in
Articles 21-15 to 21-27 of the French Civil Code, applicable at the time of Claimant’s

request for naturalisation, and they include conditions pertaining to morality, age, '°
assimilation and residence. Respondent pays particular attention to the requirements of
assimilation and residence,'4 which are to be independently assessed.'*

100. Regarding the requisite of assimilation of the French culture, based on the expert report of
Professor Jault-Seseke, Respondent argues that Mr. Pugachev does not comply with such a
requirement, as he would have been unable to provide evidence of sufficient knowledge of
the French language, for example.'®

101. Furthermore, based on the case law of the French Conseil d’Etat, the Russian Federation
submits that the residency requirements are fulfilled if the applicant has located “the centre
of his interests in a stable manner”"’ in France.'* To make this determination, the French
authorities rely on elements such as the length of the stay of the applicant in French territory,
his family situation and his source of income during such stay.!? Respondent notes that “the
financial situation of the applicant plays an important role in the assessment carried out by
the French authorities. The financial links of the applicant with France imply that his

 

income originates from France and more precisely that the applicant exercises a profession
29 20

in France
102. | Respondent noted the different assertions made by Claimant with respect to Mr. Pugachev’s
residence, highlighting that: (i) in the Notice of Arbitration, Claimant stated that Mr.
Pugachev “has resided permanently in France from 2011 onwards”;?! (ii) in the Statement
of Claim he asserted that Mr. Pugachev “resides permanently in France since 1996”;2? and
(iii) in his witness statement, Claimant stated that “[i]n 2009 ... [he] decided to once more
establish a permanent residence in France”. In Respondent’s view, it is highly unlikely
that Claimant could have been habitually residing in France before 2009, which would entail
that he did not comply with the residence requirements of the Request for Naturalisation.

Seseke, Exhibits FJS-1, FJS-11.

4 According to the Respondent: “Articles 21-16 and 21-17 of the French Civil Code provide two cumulative
conditions of residence in France: i) The applicant must prove that he has been living in France for the last five
years or, in exceptional cases, two years, before the Request for Naturalization was made (Article 21-17); and ii)
The applicant must be residing regularly in France when the naturalization decree is signed (Article 21-16).”

Respondent additionally highlights that the fact that the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeals
of Moscow made a reference to the nationality of Mr. Pugachev does not entail that the
Russian courts acknowledged the validity of his nationality. It states:

“Te]ontrary to the Claimant’s assertion, it is clear from the decision of the Ninth
Arbitrazh Court that the Russian Court did not review the Claimant's acquisition of
French nationality, rather, it simply verified, on the premise put forward by the
Claimant, that he holds French nationality, whether or not the requirements set by
the Hague Convention on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents
were fulfilled. The Claimant’s French nationality was not challenged before the
Russian Court and hence the Russian Court did not review his nationality.”

103. In the view of the Russian Federation, from the evidence available in the record of this
Arbitration,”> it cannot be established that Mr. Pugachev transferred the centre of his
interests to France; thus, failing to comply with all the requirements to acquire French
nationality under French law.”° In light of this conclusion, in its answer to the Tribunal’s
Question No. 8, Respondent notes, that “the French authorities have a discretionary power
to refuse naturalization in circumstances where the applicable conditions are met, but do
not have any discretionary power to grant naturalization where the applicable conditions
are not fulfilled” 2"

104. The Russian Federation thus concluded that Claimant did not meet the conditions for
naturalisation established in French law, making his naturalisation the product of material
error or fraud.”* As a result, Respondent submits that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction
ratione personae as Mr. Pugachev does not qualify as an “investor” under the BIT.

2. The applicability of the BIT to dual nationals of Russia and France

105. | Respondent submits that international dispute settlement mechanisms are not intended to
resolve domestic disputes between an investor and his home State; it states that this principle
is confirmed in the Preamble of the BIT, as it intends “to create favourable conditions for
French investments in the Union of Soviet Socialists Republics and Soviet investments in
France”.”° In this sense, the Russian Federation submits that the BIT excludes dual

nationals of France and Russia, which entails that dual nationals are not “investors” under
the BIT. Consequently, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae.

106. Respondent submits that in applying Articles 31(1) and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties (the “VCLT”), the correct interpretation of Article 1.2 of the BIT excludes
its applicability to dual nationals of Russia and France. The argument of the Russian
Federation is based on the language used by the Parties in Article 1.2 of the BIT: “read in
context in light of the object and purpose of the BIT, taking into account the entirety of the
provisions of the BIT’.*! It argues that all other provisions of the BIT, including those

related to the arbitration clause, refer to “investors of the other contracting Party”,
“investors of this Contracting Party”* or “investors of one of the other contracting
Parties”**

107. Respondent highlights that:*>

“The Claimant has attempted to allege that ‘none of these expressions exclude dual
nationals from the scope of the Treaty’.** However, he has himself previously
recognized that these expressions result in the express exclusion of dual French-
Russian nationals from the scope of bilateral investment treaties:

 

 

a) in his Statement of Claim, he stated that ‘France has expressly excluded dual
nationals from the scope of the BITs concluded with Ethiopia, China, Kazakhstan
and Uruguay’,*’ which respectively apply to the investors having ‘the nationality of
one or the other of the contracting Parties’,** to the nationals of one or the other

contracting Parties’,*® and to the ‘nationals of the French Republic or of the
Republic of Kazakhstan’; and

b) in his Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, he admitted that Article 4.1 of the BIT
which refers to the “investments made by investors of one or the other of the
contracting Parties” uses the same wording as the France China bilateral
investment treaty”.”

In the view of the Russian Federation, albeit the fact that Article 1.2 of the BIT does not
contain an explicit exclusion of dual nationals,"* the correct interpretation of the language
used in other provisions of the BIT — i.e., the ordinary meaning of the words“ — evidences
the intent of the Parties to exclude dual nationals; granting the protections of the BIT only
to investors of either France or Russia.*>

Respondent additionally argues that this interpretation is in line with the position taken by
the law of the former USSR (in force at the time of the conclusion of the BIT) in relation to
dual nationals; as Article 8 of the law of the former USSR on Citizenship (in effect on 4
July 1989) expressly provided that foreign citizenship of a USSR citizen “must not be
recognized”.*° According to Respondent, the cited provision evidences that the former
USSR (and thus Russia) could not have agreed to treaty claims submitted by investors
holding dual nationality, as such investors would have only been recognized as nationals of
the USSR.

3. The “dominant and effective nationality” test
Respondent submits that Mr. Pugachev remains a Russian national, as (i) he has not (and

could not have) renounced to his Russian nationality as a matter of Russian law;*” and (ii)
his genuine links,"* and thus, his “real and effective nationality” is that of Russia.

111. Regarding Claimant’s renunciation to his Russian nationality, Respondent states that
Claimant’s assertions of such renunciation,”” are inconsistent with his own actions and with
the evidence submitted to this Arbitration.*’ It notes that in the Notice of Arbitration Mr.
Pugachev declared that he had been a national of France since 2009; yet he was also a
national of Russia.*' According to the Russian Federation, Claimant has failed to produce
the certificate of acceptance of his request for renunciation to his Russian nationality for
consideration by the relevant official, which — it states — is issued automatically under
Russian law.**

 

112. With respect to the issue of Claimant’s “genuine links” with France, after referring to Mr.
Pugachev’s background from the personal, academic, professional and_ political
standpoints,*? Respondent elaborates on the principle of dominant and effective nationality,
as found in the “relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the
parties”.* Based on the Nottebohm case,*> the Russian Federation states that one of these
rules of international law is, that a nationality granted by a domestic law can only be
recognized at the international level if it corresponds to a genuine link between the natural
person and the State of which he claims nationality.°°

113. | Respondent highlights that international arbitrators apply the principle of real and effective
nationality when deciding on “allegations of nationality by the applicant State which were
contested by the respondent State”.*’ Respondent furthered its argument with the findings
of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in Case A/18, which established the criteria
required to apply the “real and effective nationality” test: his habitual place of residence,
his centre of interests, his family ties, his participation in public life and other evidence of
attachment.** The Russian Federation concluded that:

“Applying the criteria set forth by the IUSCT in Case A/18 mentioned above, it is
obvious that the Claimant’s effective and dominant nationality is not that of France.
The Claimant had neither his habitual residence, nor his centre of interests, nor his

family, in France. All of these elements were located in Russia, where his real ties
in fact lie.”

114. In this manner, the Russian Federation concludes that Mr. Pugachev’s dominant and
effective nationality is Russian; ° consequently, “the Tribunal should dismiss the
Claimant’s claims on the basis that he is not a French national in accordance with
principles of international law and the BIT”.§!

4. Claimant's holding of French nationality at the relevant times for application
of the BIT

115. Respondent argues that, in addition to requiring the investor to hold the nationality of the
non-host State (i) at the time of the alleged violations of the BIT,” and (ii) at the date when
arbitral proceedings were commenced,” Article 1.2(a) of the BIT requires the investor to
demonstrate that he was a national of the other Contracting Party (iii) at the time the
investment was made. These are the critical dates for assessment of the investor’s
nationality under the BIT.

116. In the view of Respondent, Claimant has failed to demonstrate that Mr. Pugachev was a
national of France at the time of making the investment, as well as at the time of the alleged
breaches of the BIT, even assuming that he lawfully acquired French nationality on 30
November 2009." Accordingly, Mr. Pugachev is not an investor under the BIT, and the
Tribunal thus, lacks jurisdiction ratione personae.

117. According to Respondent, the language of the BIT is sufficiently clear to require the analysis
of the nationality of the investor at the time when the investment was made. Russia supports
this argument on the rules of treaty interpretation established in Article 31 of the VCLT.

118. Respondent submits that the BIT consistently refers to investments “made” and not simply
“held” by a natural person,” including Articles 1.1, 1.2, 7, 3.1, 4.1 and 8 of the BIT.°* In its
analysis of the ordinary meaning of the words, Respondent argues that the language used in
the BIT requires that the investor be a national of the other Contracting State before making
the investment in the territory of the host State.® Respondent asserts, on the basis of the
dissenting opinion of Professor Rodrigo Oreamuno in the Serafin Garcia case,” and the
decision of the Paris Court of Appeal setting aside such award,” that the BIT’s choice of
language evidences the intent of the Contracting Parties to require the investor to be a
national of the other Contracting Party.”

119. In Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, the Russian Federation cites Article 1.2(a) as follows:

“Any natural person who is a national of one of the Contracting Parties and who is

permitted [may], in accordance with the laws of that Contracting Party, to make
investments on the territory or in the maritime zone of the other Contracting Party
(emphasis added)”.”*

 

120. The Russian Federation states that the emphasized quoted text is critical, as it creates a
temporal requirement applicable to natural persons, to be a national of the home State at the
time of making the investment; so as to be permitted to do so in accordance with the laws
of that State.”*

121. Respondent addresses the cases cited by Claimant in support of his arguments, stating that
“{njone of the treaties applied in the investment arbitration awards on which the Claimant
relies in support of this assertion contain the specific wording of the BIT — either as regards
the expression ‘investment made by investor’, or as regards the requirement for the national
to be permitted by the laws of the contracting State of his nationality to make investments

in the territory of the other contracting State”:”

7 Respondent’s Submi

a. With respect to Pac RIM Cayman v El Salvador, Respondent points out that the
wording used to define the term “investor” in the treaty applicable in said arbitration
is materially different from the BIT.”

b. With respect to Aguas des Tunari v Bolivia, Respondent highlights that the award
rendered in that case only refers to the abuse of a change of nationality by the
investor and does not analyse the conditions established in the treaty to be
considered a protected investor, rendering the award irrelevant to the present case.”

°

With respect to Vladislav Kim v Uzbekistan, Respondent notes that the tribunal
applied the ICSID Convention — which is not applicable in this case — to conclude
that the Convention requires the investor to be a national of the other contracting
State at three critical dates that do not include that of the investment. Furthermore,
the question of the critical dates was undisputed in that case, rendering the decision
irrelevant to the present case.”

Respondent, therefore, states that the definition of investor under Article 1.2(a) of the BIT
requires the investor natural person to have the legal capacity under the laws of the home
State — France — to make investments in the territory of the host State — Russia. This is a
requirement that precedes the making of the investment, i.e. its acquisition by or transfer to
the investor.”

Respondent asserts that Claimant has admitted to have made — at least — three of the
investments, object of this arbitration, before his acquisition of the French nationality;*°
namely, the Red Square Project,*! the Shipyards*? and the Land Plots.*? Regarding the EPC,
Respondent asserts that “[d]uring his cross-examination, the Claimant claimed not to recall
how he made his investment in EPC. However, in his Statement of Claim his case is that
this investment was made in 2003: ‘Mr Pugachev acquired EPC in July/September
2003’.”*4 The Russian Federation states that “[t]he Claimant’s own statements illustrate
that the investments on which he bases his claims were made before he allegedly obtained

French nationality” **

124. Respondent also argues that the “other non-Russian investments” do not fall within the
scope of the BIT, as they were made in third-party countries. However, they appear to have
been made before Claimant allegedly became a French national.

125. In response to Claimant’s allegations related to Article 10 of the BIT,*° the Russian
Federation submits that the text of this provision supports its argument according to which
the BIT provides protection to investments “made”, and not simply “held” by investors.*”
Respondent asserts that a different interpretation — one favouring the Claimant’s position —
would render Article 10 of the BIT meaningless, “as all investments would be protected,
regardless of the date they were made”.** According to the Russian Federation, this was not
the intent of the Contracting Parties when signing the BIT.*°

126. Therefore, according to the Russian Federation, by not being a national of France at the time
of the making of his investments in Russia, Claimant does not qualify as an investor in the
sense of the BIT.

127. Regarding the transnational nature of the investment, in its Response to the Tribunal’s
Question No. 11, Respondent emphasized that the BIT only covers transnational
investments and requires that an investor be a national of the other contracting State at the
time the investment was made.”

128. Furthermore, Respondent argues that Claimant was required to demonstrate that he held
French nationality at the time of the alleged violations of the BIT,! and highlights that for
the Tribunal to have jurisdiction ratione temporis, the BIT cannot retroactively apply to acts
or facts that occurred before its entry into force.°? The Russian Federation states that
international case law confirms this understanding, as found by the tribunals in Société

Générale v Dominican Republic” and Philip Morris v Australia.*

129. Respondent recalls Mr. Pugachev’s claim that the Russian Federation terminated and
expropriated the Red Square Project, and states that “even accepting the Claimant's factual
case, this termination and expropriation was first purportedly considered in 2007 and took

place before the Claimant became a French national on 30 November 2009”.°° In
Respondent’s view, the alleged expropriation — on Claimant’s case — would have taken
place on 13 April 2009, when the Presidential Order allegedly instructed the DPA to ensure
the termination of the Red Square Agreement.”

b) Claimant’s claims are abusive

130. According to Respondent, Claimant has committed an abuse of process or rights, by (i)
allegedly acquiring the French nationality with the sole purpose of gaining access to the
BIT’s protection; (ii) attempting to internationalise a domestic dispute in order to re-litigate
issues that have already been decided against him; and (iii) allegedly acquiring and holding
French nationality whilst remaining a senator in Russia.”

131. In substantiating its argument, Respondent elaborates on the doctrine of abuse, recalling
that international case law — including investment arbitration case law — provides authority
for the right of a tribunal to dismiss a claim that constitutes an abuse of right or process.”
The Russian Federation reiterates that where there is an abuse of process, the Tribunal has
a duty to ensure that the BIT does not lead to protect investments that it is not designed to
protect.”

132. Respondent states that Claimant’s alleged acquisition of the French nationality was abusive,
as its sole purpose was to gain access to the benefits of the BIT, and to internationalize a

domestic dispute that was already decided against him. Based on the decisions of the

tribunals in Venezuela Holdings v Venezuela,'” Société Générale v Dominican Republic!”

and Renée Levy v Peru,'° the Russian Federation argues that such circumstances are not
permissible with respect to existing or foreseeable disputes, or better, pre-existing disputes,
as such constitute an abusive manipulation of the system of international investment

protection.'® In the view of Respondent, the key matter is whether or not Claimant knew,
or was able to foresee a dispute under the BIT at the moment he applied for French
nationality.'"' According to Respondent:

“the Claimant knew, on his own case, that a dispute had arisen, or would probably
arise, on both 20 April 2009 (when he made his application for French nationality)
and on 30 November 2009 (when that application for nationality was granted) in
relation to (at least) his investments in the Red Square Project, and that he
subsequently acquired French nationality for the purpose of seeking to bring this
dispute within the ambit of the BIT. As a result, the Tribunal should not exercise its
discretion on the grounds that the Claimant has abused the purpose of the BIT.”'°°

133. The Russian Federation further states that Claimant’s claims have already been extensively
considered and dismissed by domestic courts:'°°

i. Respondent recalls Claimant’s arguments in relation to the Shipyard Interests: that
(a) Mr. Pugachev was forced to pledge the Shipyard Interests in favour of the
Russian Central Bank; (b) the IIB was forced into bankruptcy; (c) the DIA was
appointed as its bankruptcy receiver; and that (iv) the Russian Central Bank
proceeded to take action to enforce the Shipyard pledges which resulted in the sale
of the Shipyard Interests at an alleged undervalue.'”’ In its view, these arguments
are virtually the same as those advanced and considered before the Russian courts,
which entails that Mr. Pugachev’s arguments in this Arbitration constitute a re-
litigation of those advanced within the Russian domestic jurisdiction.'°*

ii. Regarding Claimant’s claims related to the Red Square Project, Respondent states
that the Russian courts have examined these arguments and have ultimately
dismissed them.'” Respondent highlights that the substance of the claims brought
before this Tribunal is manifestly the same as the relief sought by Claimant within
Russian jurisdiction.'!°

iii. In relation to EPC, Respondent states that EPC challenged the revocation of its
mining license in the Moscow City Commercial Court, which, in its view, is
substantially similar to Claimant’s claims brought before this Tribunal.!!!

iv. Regarding the DIA-related claims, the Russian Federation argues that the DIA, in
its capacity of bankruptcy receiver, initiated proceedings against Claimant in
England and Wales. These proceedings are linked to the Subsidiary Liability
Judgement and have already been settled by the English courts. '!? Moreover,
Respondent submits that international arbitration is not the appropriate forum for
this dispute, as it is the DIA, and not the Russian Federation, the party to those
proceedings.'' Respondent additionally points out that “[p]roceedings to enforce
the Subsidiary Liability Judgement are ongoing in the Cayman Islands,
Luxembourg and France”.''*

134. Furthermore, Respondent alleges that by submitting his claims to this Arbitration, Claimant
is attempting to inappropriately internationalise domestic disputes. Thus, it requests the
Tribunal to dismiss the claims.'!°

135. Lastly, the Russian Federation states that Mr. Pugachev’s alleged acquisition of French
nationality contravenes Russian law, since Claimant was a Russian parliamentarian at the
time of the alleged naturalisation.'!

 

136. Based on the First Expert Report of Mr. Belov, Respondent states that “Russian legislation
expressly prohibits members of the Russian parliament, including members of the
Federation Council, from holding foreign nationality (i.e., any nationality other than
Russian” .'"” In the view of the Russian Federation, Claimant’s deliberate contravention to

Russian Law reinforces its argument according to which Mr. Pugachev’s acquisition of
French nationality constitutes an abuse of process in respect of these proceedings. !!*

For these reasons, Respondent requests the Tribunal to refuse to exercise its jurisdiction and
entirely dismiss Claimant’s claims.

c) The DIA’s actions are not attributable to the Russian Federation

Respondent refers to the international rules of attribution of actions to States to establish
that the conduct of the DIA is not attributable to the Russian Federation as a matter of
international law.!!° Respondent notes that Claimant’s omission to rely on Article 4 of the
ILC Articles of Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the “ILC
Articles”), amounts to Claimant’s concession that the DIA is not a State organ. '?°
Respondent, then, states that (i) the DIA does not act with delegated government authority
in the context of Article 5 of the ILC Articles, and that (ii) the DIA was not acting under the
instruction, direction or control of Respondent under Article 8 of the ILC Articles.

Regarding Article 5 of the ILC Articles, Respondent recalls the “functional test”, stating that
it entails a two-fold approach, where Claimant was required to establish that: (a) the DIA is
empowered to exercise governmental authority as a matter of law; and (b) the specific facts
of which he complains involved the exercise of that governmental authority.!?!

According to the Russian Federation, the DIA is not empowered to exercise government
authority as a matter of law, as it acted in its capacity of bankruptcy receiver; one of its
various functions. It further states that under Russian law, such a function is defined as
“carryling] out the functions of a bankruptcy receiver (liquidator) in the bankruptcy of
credit organisations” .'”? Respondent explains that if a collapsed bank does not hold a retail
deposits license, the Russian courts have the discretion to appoint either the DIA or a private
insolvency administrator to act as bankruptcy receiver;'** However, if the bank holds the
aforementioned license, the court must appoint the DIA.'24

141. On the basis of the decisions of the tribunals in Plama v Bulgaria,'* Vocklinghaus v Czech

Republic'?® and Oostergetel v Sloval Republic,'*’ the Russian Federation asserts that the
acts carried out by a bankruptcy receiver, an administrator or a liquidator do not constitute
the exercise of government authority. In this sense, Respondent holds that the DIA does not

exercise government authority as a matter of law.

142. Furthermore, Respondent asserts that the acts of which Claimant complains did not involve
the exercise of governmental authority, since the DIA acted in the capacity of bankruptcy
receiver. In the view of Respondent, this capacity entails that the DIA was required to act
in the best interests of the bank’s creditors, and not of the Russian Federation;!7* making it
a representative of the creditors, and not of the State.!”° Additionally, based on the ILC
Commentary of Article 5 of the ILC Articles, Respondent highlights that “it is not enough
that [the State] permits [the] activity as part of the general regulation of the affairs of the
community. [Governmental authority] is a rather narrow category” .'*°

143. In the view of Respondent, Claimant failed to establish that the conduct of the DIA of which
Mr. Pugachev complains, is attributable to the Russian Federation under Article 5 of the
ILC Articles.

144. Regarding Article 8 of the ILC Articles, Respondent states that “[i]n order to succeed in
arguing that the DIA’s actions are attributable to the State [...] the Claimant must not only

establish that the State exercised general control over the DIA, but that the DIA acted on

the instructions of the State in carrying out the wrongful act”.'>!

does not necessarily entail that the State gives instructions to or has control over it.!°?

Additionally it states that the DIA’s conduct as bankruptcy receiver is limited by the
framework established in Russian law,'* and that there is no legal mechanism that would
allow Respondent to interfere with such a function, as it is expressly prohibited. Moreover,
Respondent states that Claimant has failed to adduce any evidence on an interference from
Respondent to the DIA’s functions.'**

In this sense, Respondent submits that Claimant failed to establish that the conduct of the
DIA related to the Shipyard Claims, the Other Investments and the Moral Damages Claims,
is attributable to the Russian Federation; exceeding the BIT. 35 Therefore, Respondent
asserts that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide over Claimant’s claims.

d) Claimant did not comply with the procedure established in Article 7 of the BIT

According to the Russian Federation, Article 7 of the BIT sets out the mandatory
requirements to initiate arbitration, which Claimant failed to comply with, because: (1)
Mr. Pugachev did not give notice of the dispute under the BIT, and (2) Mr. Pugachev did
not comply with the six-month cooling-off period to attempt amicable settlement of the
dispute. '° Additionally, Respondent argues that (3) Claimant cannot circumvent the
application of Article 7 of the BIT via the Most Favoured Nation clause.

1. Mr. Pugachev did not give notice of the dispute under the BIT

Respondent explains that Article 7 of the BIT contains three distinct requirements: (i) a
notice of a dispute, (ii) an attempt to settle the dispute amicably; and (iii) the expiration of
a cooling-off period of six months.'5? The Russian Federation alleges that Claimant failed
to comply with these requirements.

Regarding the notification of the dispute, Respondent states that when the provision refers
to the “raising” of the dispute, it inevitably entails a notification of such dispute as “it is
impossible to conceive how a party could “raise” a dispute tacitly and without noi

other party of it”.'*

opportunity to redress the problem before the investor submits the dispute to arbitration” .'°
Respondent notes that, if the notice is not interpreted as mandatory, the provisions of Article
7 of the BIT cannot operate, because the initiation of the attempt to amicably settle the

dispute is not triggered.'"°

151. According to Respondent, Claimant made no notification of the existence of a dispute under
the BIT. Respondent considers there is a discrepancy between the Notice of Arbitration and
the Statement of Claim: in his Notice of Arbitration, Claimant asserts that Mr. Pugachev
delivered a letter to President Putin on 14 December 2014;'*! however, in his Statement of
Claim, Claimant asserts that such letter was provided to President Putin on 10 December
2014. The Russian Federation, on its part, claims to have no record of receiving the
aforementioned letter, and challenges the genuine nature of the evidence submitted by
Claimant in that regard.'*?

2. Mr. Pugachev did not comply with the six-month cooling-off period to attempt
amicable settlement of the dispute

152. Respondent argues that the use of the word “shall” in the text of Article 7 of the BIT,
imposes a mandatory obligation on the Parties to attempt to find an amicable settlement of
the dispute during a six-months cooling-off period.'*? Based on the decisions Murphy
Exploration and Production Company International v Republic of Ecuador,'** Enron
Corporation v Argentine Republic’ and Guarachachi America Inc. and Rurelec Plc v The

Plurinational State of Bolivia,'“* Respondent asserts that the relevant inquiry is whether the

Parties made a genuine attempt to amicably settle such dispute.

153. Respondent asserts that, aside from failing to notify the dispute, Claimant did not make any
attempt to amicably settle the dispute. Furthermore, it objects to Claimant’s statement that
he “had already attempted on numerous occasions to settle the dispute amicably with

Respondent” by 21 March 2015'”, arguing that the evidence submitted by Claimant in that
regard'** appears insufficient.

The Russian Federation also opposes to Claimant’s argument that the obligation is one of
“best efforts”,'*? but notes that, “even if the Tribunal were to adopt this standard, the
Claimant did not make a ‘best efforts’ (or indeed, any) attempt at settlement: he simply
failed to inform the Respondent sufficiently of allegation of breaches before the dispute was
submitted to arbitration — this constitutes no effort to resolve the dispute prior to arbitration
on the Claimant's part”.\°

3. Claimant cannot circumvent the application of Article 7 of the BIT via the

Most Favoured Nation clause

Respondent rejects Claimant’s argument that Article 7 of the BIT is inapplicable due to the
effect of the MFN clause of the BIT, which allows him to import the most-favourable
provisions of Article 11 of the Japan-Russia bilateral investment treaty.!5! According to the
Russian Federation, (i) Claimant is not entitled to engage in disruptive “treaty-shopping”,
and (ii) in any event, the MFN clause does not extend to supplementing dispute settlement
provisions by treaty shopping.'*?

In this sense, Respondent argues that Claimant is seeking to rely on some provisions of the
BIT while rejecting others. It notes that Claimant purports to apply Article 11(1) of the
Japan-Russia bilateral investment treaty — which is silent on the topic of notification of the
dispute; but does not intend to apply Article 11(4) of the Japan-Russia bilateral investment
treaty — which prevents an investor from initiating arbitration in the presence of domestic
judicial settlement.'** In its view, such selective application constitutes disruptive treaty
shopping.

157. Respondent notes that the purpose of the MEN clause is to ensure that foreign investors
from different countries compete on the same level; not to promote disruptive treaty
shopping.'4 The Russian Federation further argues that:!*>

“contrary to the Claimant’s assertion that MFN provisions in bilateral investment

treaties should be understood to be applicable to dispute settlement, and this position
‘has been since reiterated on multiple occasions’,'” this is far from being settled

jurisprudence. The tribunal in Gas Natural v Argentina stressed that the issue of
applying a general MFN clause to the dispute resolution provisions of bilateral
investment treaties is not free from doubt, and that different tribunals, faced with
different facts and negotiating background, may reach different results.”'*"

B. Claimant’s position

158. Claimant requests the Tribunal to dismiss Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction, as — in
his view — Claimant has sufficiently and unequivocally established the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction to settle the present dispute.'°* In this sense, Mr. Pugachev argues that:'°°

i. Claimant is a protected investor under Article 1.2 of the BIT;
ii. Claimant’s claims are not abusive;

iii. notwithstanding its limited relevance to this Arbitration, the DIA’s acts are
attributable to the Russian Federation; and

iv. the provisions of Article 7 of the BIT do not constitute a procedural bar to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

159. Claimant begins by making two general preliminary remarks in relation to the burden and
the standard of proof in this case, stating that (i) the evidential burden of proof has shifted
to Respondent; and that (ii) Claimant has proved his claims under the required standard of
proof!

160. Regarding the shift of the evidential burden of proof, Claimant asserts that, pursuant to the
principle of reus excipiendo fit actor — the defendant, by raising an exception or by pleading,
becomes a plaintiff — reflected in Article 24 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, Claimant has
to prove its case; then, it is for Respondent to provide evidence and to prove the defences

raised.'*! In this context, Mr. Pugachev highlights that he has never contested that he carries
the legal burden of proving that (i) he meets the jurisdictional requirements of Article 1.2
of the BIT; (ii) he fulfils the procedural conditions of Article 7 of the BIT; and (iii) the
attributability of the DIA’s acts to Respondent.'

161. Claimant notes that “contrary to what Respondent suggests, it is a settled principle that
once a party adduces sufficient evidence in support of its assertion, the evidential burden
shifts to the other party, without affecting the legal burden of proof.”'® Claimant submits
that it was thoroughly demonstrated throughout his submissions that he has discharged his
evidential burden in all respects.

162. Additionally, Mr. Pugachev highlights that a large amount of the evidence submitted by
Respondent is self-made, which creates a strong imbalance between the Parties. Claimant
invites the Tribunal to consider such imbalance in ensuring the equality of arms between
the Parties.'*

163. Regarding the standard of proof, Claimant states that he has already provided sufficient
evidence in support of his claims.'® In this context, Mr. Pugachev notes that:

- “Under the balance of probabilities standard, any doubt should benefit to
Claimant since the evidence brought only needs to be ‘sufficient to incline a

fair and impartial mind to one side of the issue rather than the other ’;'®

-  [...] Respondent provides no serious explanation as to why its abuse of

process claim should be based on a prima facie standard, while it is
uncontested that the applicable standard for such a claim is very high; and

- Respondent also fails to justify why Claimant’s claim in relation to the DIA
would be an exception to the balance of probabilities standard, which is, on
Respondent’s own case, ‘normally applied in international arbitration”

a) The definition of “investor” under the BIT

164. Claimant begins by highlighting that the Russian courts have officially recognized that
Mr. Pugachev is a French national as stated by the judgement of the Ninth Arbitrazh Court
of Appeals of Moscow, on 15 February 2018;!© and as confirmed by the ruling of the
Commercial Court of Moscow, on 9 July 2018.'° In Claimant’s Response to the Tribunal’s
Questions, Mr. Pugachev brought to the Tribunal’s attention that, under Russian law, the
notification procedure for foreigners used by the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeals of
Moscow against Claimant was exclusively applicable to people who are not citizens of
Russia, because the main criterion for its application is the existence of foreign citizenship
residing abroad.'7! Claimant states that this understanding is further confirmed by Ruling
No. 23 of the Plenary Session of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation of 27 June
2017!” and reiterated by Professor Butler.'7°

165. Claimant thus concludes that Respondent’s denial of Claimant’s French nationality in spite
the existence of these rulings, represents an essential flaw within the Russian Federation’s
first objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.!™

166. Mr. Pugachev further argues that (1) he validly acquired French nationality, (2) there is no
bar to the applicability of the BIT to dual French-Russian nationals, (3) the principle of
“dominant and effective” nationality is not applicable to the present case; and that (4) he
was a national of France at all the relevant times for the application of the BIT.

1. The validity of Claimant’s acquisition of French nationality

167. In the present case, Claimant argues that his French nationality is valid, as (i) France has
sovereign power and a margin of appreciation in the conferment of nationality; and (ii) the
Tribunal may only examine France’s sovereign decision to grant nationality to
Mr. Pugachev in light of decisive evidence of material error or fraud.!” According to
Claimant, the Russian Federation has failed to meet its burden of proving its own
allegations.!”° Claimant also highlights that Respondent’s analysis of French law bears no
relevance to this Arbitration.

168. Regarding France’s sovereign power and margin of appreciation in the conferment of
French nationality, Claimant states that it is not for the Tribunal to assess whether the
French authorities have rightfully applied French law when conferring French nationality
to Mr. Pugachev, which renders Professor Jault-Seseke’s expert report on French law,
irrelevant.'”’ In the view of Claimant, the Tribunal is to determine the opposability of
Mr. Pugachev’s French nationality for the purposes of this Arbitration, if and only if,
Respondent had decisively established that the acquisition of such nationality was
fraudulent or the product of a material error.'* Claimant asserts that Respondent has failed
to meet its burden of bringing decisive evidence against Mr. Pugachev in that regard.'”

169. Claimant supports its argument with the reasoning of the tribunal in the Joan Micula case,'*°

and states that the margin of appreciation of a State in conferring nationality to a natural

person, is confirmed in the Report of the International Law Commission.'*! It adds that there
exists a presumption in favour of the validity of such conferment.'*?

170. Claimant challenges Professor Jault-Seseke’s expert report, noting that it does not contest
the existence of the Naturalisation Decree,'* but attempts to analyse — in the abstract —
whether Mr. Pugachev obtained French nationality under normal conditions.'* In the view
of Claimant, this analysis disregards the fact that Mr. Pugachev is an eminent and political
personality, whose citizenship may represent different interests to a State. This justifies the
exercise of France’s margin of appreciation in conferring him French citizenship.'*°

171. Mr. Pugachev also objects to Respondent’s allegations based on the Soufraki case and notes
that there is a clear contrast between that case and the case at hand. According to Claimant,
the tribunal in the Soufraki case merely disregarded a nationality certificate issued by Italian
authorities without enquiring into Mr. Soufraki’s situation at that time;'*° whereas in the

present case, Mr. Pugachev’s French nationality is materialized by an official decree issued
by the sovereign State of France as a result of a positive decision, signed by both the French
Prime Minister and the Minister of Immigration.'*”

172. Therefore, Claimant states that, as there is no doubt as to the validity of Mr. Pugachev’s
citizenship, “he is not required, for the sake of establishing that he is an investor in the
meaning of Article 1.2 of the France-Russia BIT, to demonstrate that he fulfilled the
requirements set under French law for the acquisition of his French nationality” |**

173. Furthermore, Claimant asserts that the French authorities have ample discretionary powers.
in the granting of naturalisation to certain persons, such as Mr. Pugachev. In Claimant’s
Response to the Tribunal’s Questions, he asserted that the aforementioned discretion “does
not only relate to [the French authorities’) power to refuse French nationality when the
applicant meets the conditions, but also, to different aspects of their positive decisions” .'*°
According to Claimant, these powers are also reflected in (i) the absence of judicial control
of the Administration’s granting of nationality; (ii) the fact that these decisions are not
required to be reasoned;'® (iii) the Administration’s ample margin of appreciation in its
assessment of the naturalisation requirements;!°! and (iv) the existence of expediency
decisions in regard to naturalisation.!°*

174. Claimant further noted that since the French Administration is not required to include any
reasoning as to its positive naturalisation decisions, it is not possible for Mr. Pugachev to
determine the exact route chosen by the French authorities in this case. Yet, Claimant
highlights that “[a]t the time of his Request for Naturalization, it was clear that his
naturalisation represented an interest to France”.'**

175. Regarding the power of the Tribunal to examine France’s sovereign decision to grant
nationality to Mr. Pugachev,'°° Claimant asserts that the threshold to override the decision
of a sovereign State of conferring nationality to a natural person is very high, and the
Tribunal may only do so in the case of a proven fraud or material error.'°° In substantiating

its argument, Claimant referred to the decisions in Joan Micula'”” and Mr. Franck Charles
Arif v Republic of Moldova,'** highlighting that it is not sufficient for Respondent to cast
doubts without decisive evidence.

176. In this sense, Claimant submits that:

“Mr. Pugachev has discharged his burden of proof and demonstrated that he is a
French national for the purposes of the France-Russia BIT.'” Respondent, on the
other hand, fails to prove any material error or fraud as to Mr. Pugachev’s French
nationality, and absent such rebuttal, the presumption in favour of the validity of the
State’s conferment of nationality prevails.”

2. The applicability of the BIT to dual nationals of Russia and France

177. Claimant objects to Respondent’s arguments, stating that (i) dual nationals are not excluded
from the BIT; and that (ii) in any event, Mr. Pugachev is not a Russian national.”°! In this
sense, Claimant insists that Respondent should be precluded from objecting to
Mr. Pugachev’s standing as a foreign investor under the BIT, provided that its own courts
have recognized his foreigner standing.”

178. In line with this argument, Claimant states that, contrary to the ICSID Convention,” the
UNCITRAL Rules do not contain a restriction as to the applicability of the BIT to dual
nationals of France and Russia.” In the view of Mr. Pugachev, based on the principles of
treaty interpretation,°° the issue of dual nationality should be resolved exclusively in light
of the /ex specialis existent between the Parties; i.e., the BIT.2°

179. Claimant states that, similar to the findings of the tribunal in Serafin Garcia,” the Tribunal
is to interpret the BIT in a manner that is compatible with its text, unless persuasive evidence
exists suggesting otherwise.”°* This reasoning is supported by decisions such as Abdel
Raouf Bahgat v Arab Republic of Egypt? and Dawood Rawat v the Republic of
Mauritius,'° which deemed the inexistence of a jurisdictional bar for dual nationals.
Claimant notes that similar to the case at hand, these cases were decided under the
UNCITRAL Rules.”!!

180. Mr. Pugachev emphasizes that the Tribunal cannot impose upon the Parties a definition of
investor other than that agreed in the BIT;7" therefore, the term “investor” under Article
1.2 shall be interpreted as not excluding dual nationals.?!3

 

181. Regarding Respondent’s argument that the USSR Law on Citizenship — that allegedly
prohibited dual nationals — is an indication of the signatories’ intention to exclude dual
nationals from the BIT,7'* Claimant asserts that it is misplaced and has no bearing on his
standing as a protected investor. He furthers that there is no legitimate basis for having
recourse to this domestic law in the context of Article 31 of the VCLT and that the BIT
supersedes the Russian domestic law, as recognized by the Paris Court of Appeal decision
cited by Respondent.?!>

182. Additionally, Claimant argues that, in any case, Mr. Pugachev is not a dual national, as he
renounced to his Russian nationality at the Russian Embassy in London on 10 August
2012.7!° Mr. Pugachev also notes that any renunciation to his Russian nationality has no
bearing on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, as dual nationals are not excluded from the BIT.

?°7 The Claimant notes that the Russian Federation’s attempt to distinguish the Serafin Garcia case with the case
at hand is incorrect, since that tribunal also relied on the definition of investor provided under the relevant BIT in
order to confer treaty protection to dual nationals, notwithstanding the existence of scattered terms such as the
ones cited by the Respondent in its submissions. See: Claimant’s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, 20 July 2018,

183. In Claimant’s Response to the Tribunal’s Questions, Mr. Pugachev delved into the three
arguments which Professor Butler developed in relation to the implications under Russian
law of not having a certificate confirming acceptance of a request for renunciation to the
Russian citizenship, concluding that:?!7

a. If a person never filed for withdrawal from Russian citizenship, that person will
remain a Russian citizen.?!*

b. Ifa Russian person has applied to renounce citizenship, there are three options: (i)
the denial of the application for failure to submit the necessary documentation in
the proper form; (ii) the denial of the application on the basis of statutory provisions;
or (iii) a positive withdrawal.?'? In this last case, if the response to the application
thereof is never received, the person is not a Russian citizen and it needs only to
request the issuance or reissuance of the corresponding document.?””

c. If the person applied for renunciation while physically present in Russia, the
application would have been formalized by a Presidential edict and possibly also
published in the official gazette of the Russian Federation.””! Should the application
for withdrawal be filed while the Russian citizen was abroad, the successful
renunciation would have been confirmed by a senior official within the Russian
Federal Migration Service.”

184. For these reasons, Claimant submits that Mr. Pugachev is a protected investor for the
purposes of Article 1.2 of the BIT.

3. The “dominant and effective” nationality test

185. Claimant refers to Respondent’s reliance on the Nottebohm case, noting that the ICJ’s
application of the principle of dominant and effective nationality in that case was made in
the context of diplomatic protection and was confined to that scope alone. He highlights
that “[i]n the more specific context of international investment arbitration, the applicability

of the principle of dominant and effective nationality was rejected on numerous
99 225

accounts
186. Claimant furthers its argument stating that, contrary to Respondent’s allegations, the BIT
does not provide for the application of the principle of dominant and effective nationality,
as the contrary would amount to revising the terms of the BIT and adding a condition that
was not envisaged by the Parties.?”°
187. Mr. Pugachev, therefore, submits that the BIT only requires that the investor be a “national
of one of the Contracting Parties”*”” and does not provide for the requirement of a dominant
and effective nationality.

188. However, in the event that the Tribunal deems the principle of dual and effective nationality
as applicable, Claimant submits that Mr. Pugachev’s dominant and effective nationality is
that of France.?”* In his submissions, Claimant recounts Mr. Pugachev’s ever-growing ties
with France, highlighting that, from as early as the year 2000, he was a member of the
Franco-Russian Government commission,’ owned a significant number of properties in
France,”*° had several family members permanently residing in France,”*! and finally
submitted his file for naturalisation to the French authorities on 20 April 2009;?** obtaining
French nationality on 30 November 2009.7

 

189. In sum, Claimant submits that the principle of dual nationality is not applicable to the
present case. Should the Tribunal apply such principle, Mr. Pugachev’s dominant and
effective nationality is that of France.

4. Claimant's holding of French nationality at the relevant times for application
of the BIT

190. Claimant challenges Respondent’s argument according to which, aside from the dates of
the treaty violation and the date of commencement of the arbitral proceedings,” there is a
third relevant date to assess the investor’s nationality: the date of the making of the
investment.2*> In Claimant’s view, this is an attempt of the Russian Federation to introduce
an allegedly third and new condition to the timeframe of the assessment of the nationality
of the investor.?°°

191. Claimant further objects to Respondent’s argument, according to which the BIT consistently
refers to investments “made” — as opposed to “held” — by the investor,” stating that this is
an ill-attempt of Respondent to argue that Mr. Pugachev is not a protected investor.
Claimant argues that, contrary to the Russian Federation’s allegations, Mr. Pugachev was a
French national under the BIT at the only relevant times, i.e.: (i) at the time of the breaches
of the BIT, and (ii) at the time of initiation of this Arbitration.”°* He states:

“It is indeed a settled principle that the investment is protected as of the investor's
acquisition of the relevant nationality, even if posterior to the making of the
investment, as long as the breaches of the BIT and the commencement of the arbitral
proceedings post-date said acquisition.”?*

192. Regarding the nationality of Mr. Pugachev at the time of the breaches of the BIT,
Claimant notes that Respondent does not contest that Mr. Pugachev held the French
nationality at the time of the commencement of this Arbitration, nor at the time of the treaty
breaches in regard to the Shipyard Interest, the EPC and the Land Plots. Respondent
disputes that Mr. Pugachev was a French national at the time of the breaches to the Red
Square Project.”4!

193. With respect to the Red Square Project, Claimant argues that the determination of the date
of the breach in cases where the violation of the BIT was not performed in a single act, is

made considering a chain of events.”4? Claimant asserts that the Parties agree that the breach
will not necessarily be found to have occurred at the time of the first or the last event, but
when the interference deprives the investor of its fundamental rights of ownership; this
deprivation being not ephemeral but irreversible.“* Claimant concludes that, since the BIT
states that there is no breach if the investor receives “prompt and adequate compensation”,
a breach only occurs when it becomes clear that no compensation will be received after the
expropriation becomes effective.*“4 This ultimately means that the relevant date to be
examined is that of when the expropriation of the Red Square Project became illegal.”°

194. Under this reasoning, Claimant argues that the expropriation of Mr. Pugachev’s investment
in the Red Square Project occurred at the earliest in April/May of 2010,2"° which is when
the Federal Guard Service entered into a State contract No. KC 10-06 for the reconstruction
of the Red Square Buildings with ATEKS. According to Claimant, this is the date when Mr.
Pugachev was entirely excluded from the Red Square Project.”4” Claimant further explains
that this expropriation became illegal with the irreversible decision of the Russian courts of
10 July 2014, to not compensate Mr. Pugachev.”“* Claimant highlights that the fact that the
state budget was amended in April 2009 to ensure compensation for the cancellation of the
Red Square Project simply shows a promise of payment that has not yet been fulfilled.

195. Mr. Pugachev additionally states that he has exhausted all domestic judicial remedies
available to him, recounting that he initiated two sets of legal proceedings against the
Russian Federation in 2011 and 2012 — after his acquisition of the French nationality —
seeking compensation for the loss of the Red Square Project.” However, in 2013, the
Russian courts declared the Red Square Investment Agreement null and void and denied
compensation.’ On 10 July 2014, the Supreme Court of Arbitration of the Russian
Federation rendered its last decision in that regard.*!

b) Claimant’s claims are not abusive

196. Claimant states that his acquisition of the French nationality is not abusive? and notes that
both Parties agree that it is Respondent’s burden to prove this objection.?°* He highlights,
however, that the standard for arbitral tribunals to find an abuse of process is high,” and
that a tribunal will not presume an abuse of right.?° Such finding is only upheld in very
exceptional circumstances.7*°

 

197. In any event, Claimant argues that (i) there was no dispute between Mr. Pugachev and the
Russian Federation at the time of acquisition of his French nationality;?°’ (ii) Mr. Pugachev
did not acquire French nationality for the sole purpose of the BIT; (iii) Mr. Pugachev did
not try to internationalize a domestic dispute;?** and (iv) Mr. Pugachev’s position as senator
of the Russian Federation is irrelevant to the objection of abuse of process.”

198. Regarding the non-existence of the dispute at the time of acquisition of Claimant’s French
nationality, Mr. Pugachev states that treaty shopping is not illegal as such.” Citing the
reasoning of the tribunal in Pac Rim v El Salvador,*' he notes that in examining a claim of
abuse of process, arbitral tribunals consider “whether or not all the elements of a treaty

cause of action have crystallised prior to the restructuring event” 2°

199. Regarding Mr. Pugachev’s acquisition of French nationality, Claimant reiterates that the
finding of an abuse in this regard requires that the change of nationality be made with the
sole purpose of benefiting from the treaty, and of internationalizing the dispute.” In his
submissions, Mr. Pugachev elaborates on the criteria required to find an abuse of process
following the reasoning of the tribunal in Mobil v Venezuela, stating that the timing of
the acquisition of nationality, the timing of the breach and the timing of the proceedings are
the determinant factors. In this sense, Claimant argues that:

“Mr. Pugachev submitted his Demande de naturalisation on 20 April 2009 and
acquired his French nationality on 30 November 2009. On Respondent’s own
account, from 13 April 2009 to 30 April [sic] 2009, Mr. Pugachev had multiple
meetings with Prime Minister Putin during which compensation for the loss of the
investment of the Red Square Project was discussed.””*

200. Claimant submits that the dispute over the Red Square Project was not existent, nor highly
foreseeable at the time of Mr. Pugachev’s acquisition of the French nationality.

201. Referring to the findings of the tribunals in Mobil v Venezuela”® and ST-AD v Bulgaria”
—cited by Respondent — Mr. Pugachev argues that the acquisition of a nationality before the
outbreak of a dispute is valid, even when this is done to shield the investment from a
possible future dispute. Claimant notes, however, that these cases are very different from
Mr. Pugachev’s, as his acquisition of the French nationality was not a last-minute change
only aimed at gaining access to international arbitration. Claimant supports this assertion
with the various, personal, financial and professional links of Mr. Pugachev with France.”
He further states that:

“219. Respondent cannot argue that Claimant's motives for obtaining French
nationality based on his ties with France are “not plausible” only because he was a
senator in Russia when he applied for naturalisation2®

223. Mr. Pugachev could have more easily restructured his investments by selling
his shares to foreign based companies under his control. However, his situation is
very different: acting as an individual, for personal reasons, he acquired French
nationality before he even knew of the existence of the France-Russia BIT.”

202. Regarding the internationalization of the dispute, Claimant states that there is no abuse of
process present in the sole fact that the investor makes claims before local courts prior to
the commencement of arbitral proceedings.””!

203. Referring to the findings of the tribunal in Jvan Peter Busta and James Peter Busta v Czech
Republic, Claimant submits that where both the BIT and arbitral case law allowed for
shareholder claims, this could not be construed as abusive.?”* Claimant does not contest
having resorted to local and foreign courts seeking to settle the disputes between the Parties;
but highlights that — contrary to Respondent’s position — such proceedings are not the same,
in absence of an identity of parties, or when the causes of action are different.?”*

204. Moreover, Claimant notes that the BIT lacks a “fork-in-the-road” provision, which
ultimately means that the investor is not prevented from submitting his claim before this
Tribunal even in the presence of domestic legal proceedings.”

205. Lastly, regarding Mr. Pugachev’s status as a Russian senator, Claimant states that
Respondent’s argument that Mr. Pugachev violated Russian law has no bearing on the abuse
of process objection. In this sense, the objection relates to an alleged violation of domestic
law, with no relation to Mr. Pugachev’s investments in Russia.””>

206. Claimant highlights that the objection of abuse of process relates to the validity of the
investment itself, as it seeks to prevent illegal investments from benefiting from
protection.” Claimant clarifies that the alleged illegality resulting from Mr. Pugachev’s
status as a senator and as a dual national are two different scenarios; and notes that
“obtaining a foreign nationality is a ground for early termination of a member of the

Federation Council’s mandate” 2”

Claimant thus concludes that Respondent failed to prove its abuse of process objection.
c) The DIA’s actions are attributable to the Russian Federation

As a preliminary note, Claimant states that the matter concerning the attribution of the
DIA’s actions to the Russian Federation is one of the admissibility and merits of the dispute
and should not be addressed in the jurisdictional stage.””*

Claimant rejects Respondent’s allegation that the DIA’s actions, in its capacity of
bankruptcy receiver of IIB, are relevant to three sets of claims: The Shipyard Claims,”” the
Worldwide Proceedings Declaration”*’ and the Other Investment and Moral Damages
Claims.”*! He also rejects Respondent’s contention that the lack of connection between the
DIA’s actions and the Russian Federation would result in the dismissal of the claims as
being improperly directed.?**

In this context, Mr. Pugachev states that the expropriation of the Shipyard Interests was
performed through the transfer of the investment to the trust management of the Central
Bank of Russia and its significantly undervalued sale without compensation.”** He notes (i)
that Respondent does not contest that the CBR is a State entity and that its actions are
attributable to the State; and (ii) that the actions of the DIA, though part of the overall
scheme, do not affect the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the Shipyard Interests, nor does it alter
the nature of the expropriation. Claimant thus concludes that, should the Tribunal find that
the DIA’s actions are not attributable to Respondent, Claimant’s claims would not be
affected.

In the matter of attributability, Claimant begins by stating that (i) under Article 4 of the ILC
Articles, it cannot be disputed that the DIA is a State organ; in any event, Claimant argues
that the actions of the DIA may also be attributed to the Russian Federation under (ii) Article
8 of the ILC Articles and (iii) Article 5 of the ILC Articles.7**

In the context of Article 4 of the ILC Articles,*> Claimant submits that Article 4(2) does not
exclude an entity from being a State organ merely because it is not specifically classified as

such under law.”*° Mr. Pugachev states that other factors are taken into account in order to
determine whether an entity is an organ of the State de jure and de facto.?*” He notes that
the status of a State organ may be inferred from the purpose of the entity, especially when
it serves a public purpose, as opposed to having a private or commercial purpose.”**

213. Following this reasoning, Claimant recounts the different aspects that — in his view —
evidence the nature of the DIA as a State organ:

i. Onits own account and pursuant to Russian law, the DIA is a State corporation with
the purpose of exercising the functions of compulsory deposit insurance, and has a
seal bearing the Emblem of the Russian Federation;”*? additionally — contrary to
Respondent’s allegations — the Russian Federation may be held liable for the actions
of the DIA where provided by law.?””

ii. Under Article 42.1 of the Federal Law No. 177-FZ of 23 December 2003, “[c]ontrol
over functioning of the deposit insurance system shall be exercised by the
Government of the Russian Federation and the Bank of Russia by their

representatives’ participation in the Agency’s managerial bodies.”

iii. | Russian courts granted the Ministry of Justice upon request, the access to the entire
case file of the bankruptcy proceedings of the IIB and of the subsidiary liability case
against Mr. Pugachev.??

of these terms, an “effective control” test is to be performed, in order to find a real link
between the person or entity performing the act, and the State.

215. Claimant elaborates on the “effective control” test, explaining that it can take two forms: (i)
when the person or entity acts under the instructions of the State, supplementing State
actions while remaining outside of its official structure; and (ii) when the State directs or
controls a specific operation and the conduct that is subject to the complaint, is an integral

part of its operation.?°>

216. Following this reasoning, Claimant states that the real link between the DIA and the Russian
Federation lies in the control operated by Russian courts over the DIA’s legal actions with
respect to Mr. Pugachev, as well as on other factual evidence such as the nature of the
DIA.” According to Claimant, these facts evidence the clear — general — control exercised
by Respondent over the DIA.

217. Furthermore, Claimant submits that the Russian Federation exercises specific control over
the DIA.” This is evidenced by the fact that the Moscow Commercial Court unlawfully
appointed the DIA as receiver of the IIB, albeit the fact that, under Russian law, the DIA is
only appointed in such capacity when the bankrupt bank possesses an individuals’ deposit
license;?°* which was not the case of the IIB.

218. Mr. Pugachev furthers that — contrary to Respondent’s allegations” — the DIA’s and the
Russian Federation’s interests were not materially different in regard to the legal
proceedings initiated against Mr. Pugachev, “as [the DIA’s] actions were all directed at
protecting the CBR’s interests at the detriment of that of the remaining creditors and in
view of persecuting Mr. Pugachev worldwide.”

219. Lastly, in the context of Article 5 of the ILC Articles,*°' Claimant submits that the text of the
provision entails a two-fold approach: first, the existence of an empowerment by the State;
and second, whether the unlawful acts were taken under such empowerment.

220. Mr. Pugachev explains that the concept of governmental authority is broadly interpreted
and quotes Professor Crawford to elaborate on the governmental content of an act:

“[O]ne method by which an act may be describe as having governmental content is
if the state ordinarily reserves such conduct for itself. Put another way, if a private
person can perform the function without the government’s permission, it is not to be
considered governmental.”>°

221. In this sense, Claimant argues that the administration of bankruptcy estate is considered a
non-core function representative of government authority.* Additionally, Mr. Pugachev
notes that the publicly available information related to the DIA evidences that the DIA acts
as a regulator of the banking sector and implements governmental policies in this field.*°>

222. According to Claimant, the DIA — in exercise of this governmental authority*” — has taken
a series of acts that have been detrimental to Mr. Pugachev. *°’ These included, among
others:

i. the illegal appointment of the DIA as bankruptcy receiver of the IIB;*°*

ii. the systematic actions of the DIA in the interest and for the benefit of the CBR —

and thus, the Russian Federation;

iii. the DIA’s lack of contestation as to the termination of IIB’s pledges over the
310

Shipyard Interests;

iv. the DIA’s worldwide campaign against Mr. Pugachev, since, instead of assigning
IIB’s claims to a third party through their sale, it lamnched worldwide proceedings
seeking to confiscate Claimant’s assets in clear violation of the creditor’s
interests;*!! and

v. the DIA’s launch of the worldwide enforcement proceedings of the Subsidiary
Liability Judgement issued against Mr. Pugachev, which lead to the UK Default
Judgement and the Cayman Default Judgement, as well as the launching of
enforcement proceedings in France, Luxembourg and Saint Barthelemy.*!?

In the view of Claimant, “the DIA — as the arm of the Russian Federation — is harassing
Mr. Pugachev in order to force him into seclusion, and more importantly, deprive him of
all his means for the purposes of precluding him from pursuing the present arbitration
proceedings.”>'3

Claimant, thus, concludes that the acts of the DIA are obviously attributable to the Russian
Federation in application of the ILC Articles.

d) Article 7 of the BIT does not constitute a procedural bar to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction

Claimant argues that — contrary to Respondent’s allegations — (i) Mr. Pugachev has satisfied
the requirements of Article 7 of the BIT; (ii) the provisions of Article 7 of the BIT do not
create any jurisdictional hurdle or admissibility bar, as they are purely procedural in nature
and, (iii) in application of the Most Favoured Nation Clause, Article 7 of the BIT is not
applicable.

J. Claimant satisfied the requirements of Article 7 of the BIT

According to Claimant, Article 7 of the BIT*'* does not require a formal notification of the
dispute in order to trigger the six-month period.*!> He states that the provisions of Article 7
simply require the Parties to attempt negotiations “if at all possible” for a period of six
months; this period starts “from the time when [the dispute] was raised by either one of the
parties to the dispute”.

Following the reasoning of the tribunal in the Teinver case,*'° Claimant explains that by
interpreting the language of Article 7 in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the words,
it is not possible to rightfully interpret it as containing an additional condition not expressly
contemplated in the BIT.*!7

228. According to Claimant, following the decisions of tribunals such as Abaclat*!* and
Ambiente Ufficio,’ the correct interpretation of the obligation contained in Article 7 of the
BIT is an obligation of “best efforts”, i.e. an obligation of means. Claimant supports this
argument, submitting that the correct interpretation of Article 7 of the BIT, is that of the
wording of the provision, which fails to make reference to “consultations” or
“negotiations”, and on the contrary, refers to amicable consultations “if at all possible” or
“autant que possible” >”

229. Furthermore, Claimant argues that the vast majority of arbitral tribunals construe waiting
periods as non-mandatory in nature, in cases where it is evident that the dispute is unlikely
to be settled amicably.*?! Mr. Pugachev additionally states that Respondent has wrongfully
considered that Claimant did not make the best efforts to settle the dispute. He notes that,
well-before 21 March 2015, the Parties had exchanged very different views by means of
numerous communications, which have included the highest level of Russian authorities.*”?

230. In Claimant’s view, it is evident that Mr. Pugachev has complied with the six-months period
established in Article 7 of the BIT, as the Notice of Arbitration was submitted well-after the
dispute was originally raised. Claimant notes that, aside from contending the authenticity
of the letter of 10 December 2014, the Russian Federation had the burden of proving the
existence of a fraud, which it has failed to meet.*?*

2. The provisions of Article 7 of the BIT are of procedural nature

231. Claimant submits that waiting periods and notices of disputes are not requisites for
jurisdiction, but rather, procedural rules*** to encourage negotiations, with the object of
allowing the parties to avoid resorting to arbitration. Additionally, Mr. Pugachev submits
that where there is no realistic change for meaningful consultations, Claimant may resort to
arbitration before the waiting period has expired.*”°

232. Citing the decision in Tulip v Turkey, Claimant asserts that the notice of dispute requirement
is a procedural provision that does not bar the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, nor does it constitute
grounds for inadmissibility.*”°

233. In relation to the cooling-off period, Claimant first refers to the decision of the Guarachachi
America Inc and Rurelec Plc v The Plurinational State of Bolivia — cited by Respondent’
—, which concluded that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction over certain claims because of the
claimant’s inobservance of the cooling-off period. Claimant clarifies that Respondent omits
to note that the relevant treaty in that case contained a very different wording from the BIT,
requiring a “written notification of a claim” >°*

234. Claimant further highlights that numerous arbitral tribunals, including those in Enkev v
Poland,*”° SGS v Pakistan,*° Lauder v Czech Republic, 33! and Biwater, *** (among
others)**> have considered waiting periods as merely procedural.

235. In this sense, Claimant submits that Respondent has failed to reply to Claimant’s many
attempts to settle the dispute by way of negotiations; therefore, the Russian Federation’s
objection is without merit and simply dilatory.**

3. The non-application of Article 7 of the BIT via the Most Favoured Nation
Clause

236. Mr. Pugachev argues that the use of the MEN clause is a well-settled practice in investor-
State arbitration, as first-confirmed in the Maffezini case, where it was used to circumvent
the conditions of exhaustion of local remedies and expiration of the cooling-off period.**
Claimant notes that this position has been reiterated on multiple occasions**° and has been

recognized by scholars and practitioners.**”

237. In this sense, Claimant relies on Article 3(2) of the BIT, which contains the MFN Clause
that “allows the importation, to the present dispute, of more favourable procedural
provisions (i.e., no notice of dispute or cooling-off period)” .*** In the view of Claimant, he
“may rely on the more favourable procedural provisions provided under Article 11 of the
Japan-Russia BIT’, which circumvents any requirement of a notice of dispute or of a
cooling-off period.>”

238. Claimant further states that — contrary to Respondent’s assertions*“° — his reliance on the

MEN provision does not constitute “disruptive treaty shopping”. *4' He agrees with

Respondent that the purposes of these types of clauses are to “accord foreign investors

treatment no less favourable than that accorded to the ‘most favoured’ third nation”;*

therefore, importing the most-favourable provision contained in the Japan-Russia BIT

amounts to applying the MEN clause in accordance with its purpose, without undertaking
99 343

any “cherry-picking”.

Lastly, Claimant states that, the fact that the domestic proceedings in Russia allegedly
involved “the very same issues he now brings under the BIT’** is purely irrelevant.
Mr. Pugachev cites the tribunal’s reasoning in Alex Gestin v Estonia**’ to hold that the
existence of domestic proceedings should not bar a claimant from recurring to investment
arbitration. Claimant notes that endorsing otherwise would constitute a genuine denial of
justice, since Mr. Pugachev would be deprived of any forum to seek remedy for
Respondent’s breaches.*#°

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Tribunal has carefully considered all arguments and allegations made by the Parties.
The fact that any of the arguments of the Parties summarised above are not referred to
below, should not be taken to mean that the argument has not been considered.

Each of the following conclusions of the Tribunal in this Award is based on the analysis
explained hereinbelow: (A) Claimant has the burden to prove the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
over the dispute; (B) Claimant is a French national under international law; (C) dual
nationals are not excluded from the Treaty; (D) the Treaty requires a claimant to have held
the nationality of the other Contracting Party, i.e. the non-host State, at the time the
investment is made; and (E) Respondent’s allegations regarding abuse of process,
attribution and the fulfilment of mandatory preconditions under the Treaty do not affect the
Tribunal’s findings on jurisdiction.

Claimant has the burden to prove the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the dispute

Respondent argues that Claimant bears the burden of proof with respect to establishing the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over his claims.*” Respondent refers to the tribunal’s findings in
Gallo v Canada to claim that the maxim “who asserts must prove” applies also in the
jurisdictional phase of an arbitration, and that, accordingly, a claimant bears the burden of
proving he has standing and the tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims submitted. In
Respondent’s view, Claimant bears this burden even where, as in the case at hand,
Respondent has raised jurisdictional objections.”

Respondent clarifies that its objection concerning abuse of process is different because such
a challenge, by its nature, goes to the admissibility of Claimant’s claims, rather than to a
pure issue of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.*°° Further, Respondent asserts that Claimant

cannot meet his burden of proof through mere assumptions or allegations. Instead, he must
proffer evidence to establish the facts that support his claims with respect to jurisdiction.**!

On the contrary, Claimant submits that a majority of arbitral tribunals and commentators
have asserted that, in international arbitral proceedings, the burden of proof rests upon the
party that is advancing an allegation.*” It is thus simplistic to assert that Claimant bears the
burden of proof in relation to Respondent’s objections, especially where Claimant has
already provided sufficient evidence in support of his claims.

Claimant contends that, by virtue of the principle of onus probandi actori incumbit, the
burden of proof shifted to Respondent. It is, therefore, Respondent that currently bears the
burden of proving its objections.*°

a) Claimant has the burden to prove the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the dispute

As a preliminary remark, the Tribunal recalls that under Article 27.1 of the UNCITRAL
Rules “Each party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support its claim
or defence’. This leaves no doubt that it is for Claimant to prove the facts on which he relies
to hold that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under the BIT and for Respondent to prove the
facts that support its defence according to which the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.

The Tribunal observes that Claimant admits that he carries the legal burden of proving that
the jurisdictional requirements of the Treaty are met.*°4 This must be the case because
shifting the legal burden of proof would require Respondent to prove a series of negatives
(e.g. that Claimant is not an investor, that Claimant has not complied with the requirements
of the BIT, and that the actions of which Claimant complains are not attributable to
Respondent).

Moreover, the Tribunal notes that it is an accepted principle of international law that the
claimant in an arbitration bears the legal burden of showing that the tribunal has jurisdiction
to consider its claim. This principle has been affirmed by a number of investment tribunals,

249. The Tribunal considers that a distinction must be drawn between the “legal burden” and the
“evidential burden” of proof. As numerous tribunals have explained, there is a difference
between the legal burden of proof (which never shifts) and the evidential burden of proof
(which can shift from one party to another, depending upon the state of the evidence).*°? In
the case at hand, this distinction is helpful to examine the significant differences in the
Parties’ submissions.

250. In this case, the Tribunal considers that the debate about the “legal burden” of proof is just
apparent. The real matter of controversy between the Parties is whether Claimant has
discharged himself from the “evidential burden” of demonstrating that he satisfied the
Treaty’s requirements for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. If that were to be the case, then the
Russian Federation would be required to produce persuasive counter-evidence.

251. In the same vein, the Tribunal agrees that the allegations concerning the abuse of process
are distinct. In relation to Respondent’s arguments according to which Claimant’s claims
should be deemed inadmissible as they constitute an abuse of process, the Tribunal finds
that Respondent has a positive case to put forward in this regard. The Tribunal will not add
any further comments since Respondent itself admits carrying the legal burden of proving
this objection”

b) The applicable standard of proof

252. Claimant cannot meet his evidential burden of proof through mere assumptions or
allegations. Rather, he must proffer evidence to establish the facts that support his claims
with respect to jurisdiction. This implies, inter alia, submitting appropriate means of
evidence to prove compliance with each of the Treaty’s requirements. Claimant, therefore,
has the burden to prove he is an “investor” in accordance with the Treaty, which implies the
burden to prove that he holds an investment in Russia; that he has complied with the
requirements of Article 7 of the Treaty; and that the acts of the DIA are attributable to
Respondent.

253. Throughout his Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Claimant repeatedly referred to a prima
facie standard as the applicable standard to his burden of proving the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.
The Tribunal disagrees. The applicable standard of proof at this jurisdictional stage of the

389 Exhibit CL-359: Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc. v United States of America, 1CSID Case No.
ARB(AF)/12/1, Award, dated 25 August 2014, at § 8.8: “The Tribunal considers such a distinction exists between
the legal burden of proof (which never shifts) and the evidential burden of proof (which can shift from one party
to another, depending upon the state of the evidence).”; Exhibit CL-360: Mercer International Inc. v Government
of Canada, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3, Award, dated 6 March 2018, at 7.14: “[...] the Tribunal must also
take account of the distinction between the legal burden of proof (which never shifts) and the evidential burden of
proof (which can shift from one party to another, depending upon the state of the evidence). [...]”. See also Exhibit
CL-361, United Parcel Service of America Inc. v Government of Canada, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award
on the Merits, dated 24 May 2007, {{[ 83-84: “The Tribunal notes that there are three distinct elements which an
investor must establish in order to prove that a Party has acted in a manner inconsistent with its obligations under
article 1102. [...] This is a legal burden that rests squarely with the Claimant. That burden never shifts to the Party,
here Canada”.

arbitration is not prima facie. In this regard, the tribunal in Emmis v Hungary determined
that:

“[There are] two types of jurisdictional proof [...] The first relates to questions of
fact that must be definitively determined at the jurisdictional stage. The second
involves questions of fact that go to the merits. [...] [T]he burden of proving that [the
Claimants] owned an investment capable of expropriation [...] lies fully within the
ambit of the jurisdictional phase. This burden is to be contrasted with the need to
establish on a prima facie basis at the jurisdictional phase that the Respondent
breached the treaty [...]”2°!

A similar approach was followed in Gallo v Canada, where the tribunal explained that if
jurisdiction rests on the existence of certain facts, these must be proven at the jurisdictional
stage.5

During the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Respondent presented the issue of the applicable
standard of proof in the following words:

“We say it is Mr Pugachev’s burden to prove that he qualifies as an investor; and
this is something that he is not disputing. Where we do disagree with Mr Pugachev
is the standards of proof that he needs to meet. Mr Pugachev says that he meets his
burden of proof by providing his French passport. Russia says that Mr Pugachev
must prove on the balance of probabilities that he is a French national for the

purposes of international law. The Tribunal will not have another opportunity to
consider Mr Pugachev's nationality in this arbitration. As is the case with any issue
being considered with finality, prima facie evidence cannot be adequate.”***

The Parties have not pleaded that during the jurisdictional phase, there is a heightened or
exceptional standard of proof. The Tribunal is persuaded that, in the absence of a heightened
or exceptional standard of proof, the applicable standard to be met by Claimant must be that
which is normally applied in international arbitration. Respondent claims that such standard
is the “balance of probabilities”, a term used by several investment tribunals and imported
from the common law tradition, which means weighing whether something is more likely
than not. In civil law traditions the standard would be the “intimate conviction” of the
adjudicator. Tribunals have also used terms such as “preponderance of the evidence”. But
in the end, the result is the same. Claimant must persuade the Tribunal so that it reaches the
intimate conviction that it is more likely than not that Claimant is a protected investor and
that he complied with all the prerequisites set out in the Treaty.

As to Respondent’s allegation that the balance of probabilities standard should be
modulated exclusively for the abuse of process and attribution claims, the Tribunal finds no
compelling reasons to do so. Respondent did not submit substantiated reasons in that regard,
just mere allegations. Thus, the applicable standard to prove that Claimant’s claims are

abusive and that the acts of the DIA are attributable to Respondent should also be balance
of probabilities.

c) Claimant has not discharged his burden of proof with respect to all of the Treaty’s
requirements

The Tribunal considers that in order to determine whether Claimant has discharged his
burden of proof, each requirement under the Treaty must be analysed separately.
Compliance with each requirement depends on a series of facts that must be proven
separately for each given requirement. The Tribunal cannot draw a general conclusion that
Claimant discharged his evidential burden of proof with regard to all of the Treaty’s
requirements. On the contrary, it is necessary to determine for each individual prerequisite
whether Claimant has provided sufficient evidence to shift the evidentiary burden — not the
legal burden — to Respondent.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal reiterates that Claimant has the burden of proving
on the balance of probabilities that:

a. he is an “investor” in accordance with the Treaty, which implies proving that he has
investments in the Russian Federation;

b. he has complied with the requirements of Article 7 of the Treaty; and
c. that the acts of the DIA are attributable to Respondent.

On its turn, Respondent bears the burden of proving that Claimant’s claims constitute an
abuse of process.

Without prejudice of the complete analysis provided below, the Tribunal observes that
Claimant discharged his evidential burden to prove that he is a French national under French
law. Accordingly, the evidential burden of proving that, for purposes of the analysis under
international law, Claimant’s Naturalisation Decree was the result of fraud or material error
lies on Respondent. As further explained in Section IV (B) infra, the Tribunal finds that,
even though there are some questions in the process of naturalisation of Mr. Pugachev, there
is no evidence that allows the Tribunal to conclude that Claimant obtained his French
nationality through fraud or material error.

. Claimant is a French national under international law

In its Interim Award, the Tribunal declared that “[...] until proven otherwise, and without
pre-judging Respondent's jurisdictional objections, Mr. Pugachev is a French national, and
thus appears to be an investor pursuant to Article 1.2(a) of the France-Russia BIT.” The
Tribunal will now analyse whether Mr. Pugachev is a French national for purposes of
determining its jurisdiction. If Claimant is not a French “investor” in accordance with
Article 1.2(a) of the Treaty, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Claimant’s claims.

Claimant submits that Mr. Pugachev is a French national and asserts that even the Russian
Federation itself had acknowledged this fact when the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeals of
Moscow applied the notification procedure for foreigners in a case against Claimant.*
According to Mr. Pugachev, this decision, which was confirmed by (i) the Commercial
Court of Moscow on 9 July 2018;** (ii) the Plenary Session of the Supreme Court of the
Russian Federation on 27 June 2017; *% and (iii) Professor Butler, **’ evidences
Respondent’s understanding that Mr. Pugachev is a French national.

Furthermore, Claimant states that Mr. Pugachev validly acquired French nationality, as (i)
France has sovereign power and a margin of appreciation in the conferment of nationality;
and (ii) the Tribunal may only examine France’s sovereign decision to grant nationality to
Mr. Pugachev in light of decisive evidence of material error or fraud.*°*

On its part, Respondent argues that Claimant did not discharge its burden of proving that he
validly acquired French nationality in accordance with French law. This since, according to
the Russian Federation, Mr. Pugachev did not comply with the mandatory requirements for
acquiring nationality through naturalisation under French Law, “notwithstanding the
French authorities’ decision to naturalise him.>°

Respondent highlights that the Tribunal is competent to independently determine, for the
purposes of this Arbitration, whether Mr. Pugachev acquired French nationality in
accordance with French law.*”° It notes that the Tribunal has the power to disregard any
nationality documents, as they merely constitute prima facie evidence of Mr. Pugachev’s
nationality.

The Tribunal observes that it is undisputed by the Parties that Mr. Pugachev is a French
national under French law. Furthermore, the Parties appear to agree that the Tribunal may
only disregard the decision of a sovereign State (i.e. France) to confer its nationality to a
natural person if that person has acquired such nationality as a result of “fraud” or “material
error”. The Tribunal reiterates that, as set out in Section IV (A) supra, the evidential burden
of proving that Claimant’s Naturalisation Decree was the result of fraud or material error
lies on Respondent.

Having thoughtfully reviewed the multiple submission made by both Parties, and for the
reasons set out below, the Tribunal finds that (a) the Tribunal has the power to decide

whether Mr. Pugachev is a French national for purposes of the present Arbitration; (b)
Claimant submitted enough evidence of his French nationality and discharged his burden
of proof; (c) the threshold required to override the State’s decision to confer its nationality
to a natural person is high; and (d) Respondent failed to meet its burden of proving that
Claimant’s naturalisation was the result of a material error or fraud.

a) The Tribunal has the power to decide whether Mr. Pugachev is a French national
for purposes of the present Arbitration

The Parties do not dispute that, in order to ascertain ratione personae jurisdiction, the
Tribunal has the power to determine Mr. Pugachev’s nationality for purposes of this
Arbitration.

An individual’s nationality is determined, primarily, by the law of the State of whose
nationality is claimed. It is accepted in international law that the nationality of a person is
determined within the domestic sovereign jurisdiction of a State which, in accordance with
its own laws and regulations, establishes the rules concerning the acquisition and loss of
nationality. The Tribunal shares the reasoning set forth in Soufraki v United Arab Emirates,
where the tribunal explained:

“Tt is accepted in international law that nationality is within the domestic juri isdiction

 

(and loss) of its nationality Article 1(3) one ‘BIT reflects this rule. But it is no 0 less

 

accepted that when, in ational arbitral or judicial pr dings, the nationality
of a person is chalk d, the international tribunal is to pass upon that
challenge. It will accord great weight to the nationality law of the State in question
and to the interpretation and application of that law by its authorities. But it will in
the end decide for itself whether, on the facts and law before it, the person whose
nationality is at issue was or was not a national of the State in question and when,
and what follows from that finding. Where, as in the instant case, the jurisdiction of
an international.”*"

The ICSID ad hoc committee on the application for annulment of the Soufraki award upheld
the tribunal’s finding. The committee reiterated that:

“[...] the principle is in fact well established that international tribunals are

ed to determine whether a party has the alleged lity in order to
ascertain their own jurisdiction and are not bound by national certificates of
nationality or passports or other documentation in making that determination and
ascertainment.”*”

Furthermore, the Micula v Romania tribunal expressly endorsed the same principle, stating
that:

7 July 2004, 55 (emphasis added).

“The Tribunal is mindful of the analysis and conclusions of the tribunal and the ad
hoc committee in the Soufraki case and of the authorities quoted by the ad hoc
committee in Soufraki to the effect that it has the power and the duty to examine the
existence of the treaty-required nationality.”*”

In the same vein, the tribunal in Micula v Romania determined that it would not necessarily
defer to the views of national authorities if there has been fraud or material error:

“It would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to consider Mr. Viorel Micula (or his
brother) to be a Swedish national for the purpose of the ICSID Convention and the
BIT if it were shown that he had obtained Swedish nationality by fraud or material
error, in other words in a manner i i with international law.”*"*

Accordingly, and bearing in mind the Parties’ allegations in this regard, the Tribunal
concludes that it has the power to determine Mr. Pugachev’s nationality for purposes of the
present Arbitration. To this end, even though the Tribunal will pay due consideration to
Mr. Pugachev’s French Naturalisation Decree and other documentation, it is not bound by
them in order to make its own findings as to the nationality of Claimant under international
law.

b) Claimant is a French national

The Tribunal observes that Claimant has submitted three different sets of arguments in order
to prove his acquisition of French nationality: (i) documents issued by the French
authorities; (ii) contextual evidence and other allegations; and (iii) the Russian courts’
apparent recognition of Mr. Pugachev’s French nationality.

  

The Tribunal will analyse each of these arguments below.

First, the Tribunal finds that Claimant has submitted appropriate and suitable documentation
to prove that he is a national of France.

From the outset, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Pugachev’s naturalisation was the result of a
positive decision of the French authorities. Unlike some of the cases invoked by the Parties,
Mr. Pugachev became a national of France by conduct of an official administrative act of
the French Administration. The evidence put forward by Claimant should be assessed with
due consideration to this fact.

Under French law, nationality can be either granted or acquired.5”° French nationality is
granted when the person is deemed French as of birth. By contrast, French nationality is
acquired when the applicant, born as a foreigner, becomes French through naturalisation.*”°

It is undisputed that Mr. Pugachev is a Russian national from birth, and that he acquired
French nationality through naturalisation. The subject matter of this particular dispute is
whether Claimant’s Naturalisation Decree was the result of fraud or material error.

In its Submission on Jurisdiction, Respondent extensively describes the different
requirements a person would need to fulfil in order to acquire French nationality.
Respondent argues, inter alia, that to acquire French nationality through naturalisation, the
foreigner must fulfil certain conditions set out in the law. Specifically, Articles 21-15 to 21-
27 of the French Civil Code (applicable at the time of Claimant’s request for naturalisation),
set out the conditions required for granting French nationality through naturalisation. These
conditions pertain to age, morality, assimilation and residence.>”” In her First Expert Report,
Professor Jault-Seseke thoroughly describes and explains each of the conditions required to
acquire French nationality.>”

The Tribunal observes that, pursuant to French law, Mr. Pugachev could have acquired
French nationality through naturalisation on two main grounds:

a. residence in France for 5 years, residence being understood as the location of the
applicant’s centre of interests (the “Residence Route”); or

b. exceptional services rendered to France or France’s exceptional interest in the
naturalisation of the applicant (the “Exceptional Services Route”).*” The Parties
disagree on whether naturalisation through the Exceptional Services Route can only
be granted after an advisory opinion issued by the French Conseil d’Etat based on
a justified proposal by the competent Minister.

Respondent asserts that, regardless of whether Claimant alleges that he requested French
nationality based on the Residence or Exceptional Services Route, he would have been
required to satisfy two other conditions for the admissibility of his naturalisation request,
i.e. (i) the assimilation condition provided for in Article 21-24 of the French Civil Code;**°
and (ii) the residence requirement at the date of the Decree for Naturalisation pursuant to
Article 21-16 of the French Civil Code.**!

At this point, the Tribunal observes that it is undisputed by the Parties that, regardless of the
specific route applied, the French Administration grants French nationality through a
naturalisation decree.

284. The Tribunal observes that Claimant has submitted the following relevant documents to
evidence his French nationality:

a. Claimant’s Naturalisation File;**?

b. Claimant’s Naturalisation Decree;**° and

c. Claimant’s French passport**.

285. The authenticity of the aforementioned documents has not been challenged in this
Arbitration. There is no evidence an authority of France, administrative judicial or
otherwise, has rendered any of such documents null, void or ineffective. Furthermore, there
is no evidence that the above documents have been challenged under French law or before
the French authorities.

286. Second, the Tribunal notes that Claimant provides a number of contextual assertions with
regard to his acquisition of French nationality. For instance, Claimant asserts that, although
he travelled considerably throughout the world for business purposes (e.g. to the Russian
Federation, the United States of America and Switzerland) it cannot be contested that
Mr. Pugachev resides in France since 1996 and is an active resident of the city of Nice.**°

 

287. Moreover, Claimant submits that, as of 1999, members of his family, including his former
wife, went to reside to France. Since 2005, Claimant’s parents and sister resided
permanently in France, both of his parents passed away in France and are buried in Nice,
and other members of his family still reside in France.**° Moreover, Mr. Pugachev alleges
that his third child was born in Nice on 21 June 2010, that two of his sons were educated in
France and that they still both live in France along with Claimant’s grandchildren. Claimant
further asserts that three generations of his family now live in France and have acquired the
French nationality.**”

288. Claimant submits he owns a number of properties in France and had substantial financial
interests there.*** For instance, in October 2007, Claimant acquired the group Hédiard and,
in 2007, he acquired up to 20 % of the newspaper France Soir.**

289. The Tribunal considers that some of the references submitted by Claimant may have
relevance in certain contexts, but, in this particular case, the preponderance of this evidence
is far from convincing to establish that Mr. Pugachev resided in France during the term
alleged by him. First, Claimant, as correctly noted by Respondent, incurred in several
contradictions regarding the initiation and term of his alleged residence in France.*”°
Second, it is difficult for the Tribunal to believe that a person that claims to have resided in
France for almost two decades is unable to provide substantial evidence of residence, such
as evidence of payment of utilities, lease agreements, invoices or receipts. Third, the fact
that his parents and sister were living in France is not of significant relevance to determine
whether Mr. Pugachev himself resided in France.

290. Third, Claimant asserts that Respondent’s own domestic courts have officially recognised
that Mr. Pugachev is a French national.

291. The Parties debate the extent to which (if any) the Russian courts’ decisions referring to
Mr. Pugachev’s nationality are relevant to the present Arbitration. Claimant claims that on
15 February 2018, the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeals of the Russian Federation deemed,
in clear and unequivocal terms, that Mr. Pugachev is a French national.*°! The latter
decision was confirmed by the ruling of the Commercial Court of the Moscow Circuit dated
9 July 2018.*? In Claimant’s view, the Russian Federation’s position in the present
arbitration proceedings as to Claimant’s French nationality is in blatant contradiction with
its own courts’ recent rulings.*?

388 Claimant’s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, 20 July 2018, {| 58. On this point, Claimant claims that “in 1999,
Mr Pugachev began negotiations with French and foreign banks for the sale of IIB (e.g. Credit Agricole, BNP
Paribas, etc.). By 2001, Mr Pugachev was elected as a member of the Federal Council of the Federal Assembly
(Russian Parliament) and therefore decided to divest IIB from his group of companies into a trust (of which 25%
was owned by top management of IIB and the remaining 75% was owned by Mr Pugachev’s family members).
From that point on, negotiations for the sale of IIB were conducted by the top management of IIB.” Claimant’s

Conversely, Respondent alleges that it is clear from the decision of the Ninth Arbitrazh
Court of Appeals of Moscow that the Russian Court did not review Claimant’s acquisition
of French nationality. Rather, it simply verified, on the premise put forward by Claimant,
whether the requirements set by the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and
Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters dated 15 November 1965 (the
“Hague Convention”) on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents were
fulfilled. Claimant’s French nationality was not challenged before the Russian Court and,
hence, the Russian Court did not review his nationality.°**

As a preliminary remark, the Tribunal observes that a decision of the Russian courts would
not, in principle, be binding on matters of French nationality either in France or before an
international arbitration tribunal. This, for the simple reason that it is not for the Russian
courts to decide whether or not Mr. Pugachev is a French national in accordance with French
law, or whether or not he is a French national for purposes of the BIT.

Furthermore, the Tribunal is persuaded by the explanation put forward by Respondent in its
Responses to the Tribunal’s Questions to the Parties. Respondent describes that Article
121(4)(2) of the Commercial Procedure Code of the Russian Federation sets out the general
rule according to which individuals shall be notified at their place of residence: “Court
notices addressed to individuals, including individual entrepreneurs, [shall be] sent to their
place of residence [...].°° The starting position, therefore, is that under Russian law an
individual will be notified at their place of residence, regardless of his or her nationality.

The aforementioned provision is complemented by the Hague Convention, which prescribes
the method of service abroad. The Tribunal finds particularly enlightening that the use of
the Hague Convention does not depend on the nationality of the person to be notified of the
relevant court proceedings. As it is evidenced from Article 1, the application of the Hague
Convention depends exclusively on whether there is a need to transmit a notice abroad.*°°

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the notification procedure referred to in both
Russian courts’ decisions on which Claimant relies, applies when the person to be notified
is resident or domiciled in a foreign country, regardless of his or her nationality.
Accordingly, the only inference that can be drawn from the notification procedure adopted
by the Russian courts is that the Russian courts considered that Claimant was resident in
France at the time of the Russian court proceedings (i.e. from 2017 to 2018), which is not
disputed by the Parties.

The Tribunal, therefore, concludes that Mr. Pugachev has adduced enough evidence to
discharge his legal burden of proof in regard to his nationality. Accordingly, the evidential
burden of proof shifted to Respondent, which is required to produce counter-evidence

showing that Claimant’s acquisition of French nationality was the result of fraud or material
error.

c) There is a high threshold to override the State’s decision to confer its nationality
to a natural person

The Parties dispute the standard of proof that would be required to rebut Claimant’s
evidence of having acquired French nationality on 30 November 2009. Specifically, the
matter in dispute is whether the threshold to overcome such resumption is “very high” or if
it is sufficient to simply “cast doubts” about Claimant’s acquisition of French nationality.

Claimant asserts that the threshold to override the decision of a sovereign State (i.e. France),
to confer its nationality to a natural person is “very high” and the Tribunal may only
disregard that decision should Respondent prove a decisive case of fraud or material
error?”

In opposition, Respondent alleges that Claimant bases his assertion according to which a
“very high” standard of proof is required on two cases, both of which are distinct from the
circumstances of this Arbitration. In Respondent’s view, in each of the cases submitted by
Claimant, the respondent State proffered no, or nearly no, evidence that Claimant had not
complied with the applicable national requirements.*°*

Below the Tribunal will assess the Parties’ submissions in this regard.

First, the Tribunal notes that it is undisputed by the Parties that there is a presumption
established in favour of the legality of the French authorities’ decision to grant
Mr. Pugachev the French citizenship. Claimant’s Naturalisation Decree*”’, as any other
administrative decision issued by the French authorities has been published in the French
Journal Officiel de la République francaise, and is deemed to be legal unless otherwise
proven.

Second, even though this Tribunal has the power to determine Mr. Pugachev’s nationality
for purposes of this Arbitration, it must respect and display a deferent attitude towards the
French authorities’ sovereign decisions. As regards French nationality, the French
authorities are the only ones empowered to apply French law, assess whether an individual
meets the requirement to become a French national and grant French nationality through a
naturalisation decree. This deference towards French authorities is underpinned by the fact
that those authorities dispose of a wide margin of appreciation in the conferment of its
citizenship to a natural person.

Third, the Tribunal observes that other arbitral tribunals have analysed similar cases and
determined that the threshold to override such presumption is “high”. For instance, in Joan
Micula v Romania, the tribunal explained that:

“The burden of proving that nationality was acquired in a manner inconsistent with
international law lies with the party challenging the nationality. In that respect, there
exists a presumption in favour of the validity of a State’s conferment of nationality.
The threshold to overcome such presumption is high.”

In the same vein, the tribunal in Arif v Moldova found that it would only be inclined to
disregard the decision of the French authorities if there was “convincing and decisive
evidence” against it, and that for this purpose “casting doubt is not sufficient’. In the words
of that tribunal:

“This Tribunal does not consider appropriate to exercise its control over the French
authorities’ decision to grant French nationality to Mr. Arif. Following the

reasoning of the Tribunal in Micula, it would only be inclined to disregard the
decision of the French authorities if “there was convincing and decisive evidence”
that Mr Arif’s acquisition of French nationality “was fraudulent or at least resulted
from a material error. It is for Respondent to make the showing. For this purpose,
casting doubt is not sufficient.” Respondent has not proved that Mr. Arif’s

nationality was obtained fraudulently or resulted from a material error of the French
authorities."

The Tribunal is aware that there are certain differences between the Joan Micula and Arif
cases and the present Arbitration. In fact, as argued by Respondent, the arbitral tribunal in
Micula v Romania stated that “casting doubt is not sufficient”, but then went on to state that
“[...] the Respondent has presented only limited evidence, none of which is sufficient to
-402 7 ikewise, in Arif v Moldova the respondent did not bring
any evidence to support its assertion that the Claimant did not hold the required
nationality.“

make the necessary showing.

However, regardless of the factual circumstances referred to in the previous paragraph, it is
not contested that a State’s conferral of nationality is presumed valid and that the burden of
proof lies on the party challenging such conferral. The Tribunal considers that the fact that
the respondents in these cases did not bring sufficient evidence, does not necessarily change
the underlying solution of the aforementioned tribunals, i.e. (i) a shift in the evidential
burden of proof; and (ii) a high burden for the party contesting one individual’s nationality.

“4 Respondent’s Reply on Jui

The Tribunal notes that the Parties’ debate over the standard of proof is a linguistic debate,
rather than a legal debate. The Parties do not explain what the difference under international
law is, if it exists, between a “very high”, “high”, or “casting of doubt” standard of proof.
The relevant issue here is that Respondent must prove that there was an error or a fraud in
the issuance of a State administrative act, for which the French State has a wide margin of
discretion.

Proving an error or fraud in the issuance of a discretionary administrative act of a Sovereign
State granting nationality to a foreigner requires much more than “casting doubt” as to the
French authorities’ determination. It requires clear and convincing evidence that there was
a fraud or that the French authorities incurred in a material error, and that such fraud or error
rendered the decision of the French State invalid under international law. As analysed
below, no such evidence has been submitted in this Arbitration.

d) Respondent failed to prove that Claimant’s acquisition of French nationality was
the result of fraud or material error

Up to this point, the Tribunal has found that (i) it has the power to decide whether
Mr. Pugachev is a French national for purposes of the present Arbitration; (ii) Claimant
submitted enough evidence of his French nationality and discharged his burden of proof;
and that (iii) in order to override the French State’s decision to confer its nationality to
Claimant, positive evidence of a fraud or a material error must be submitted. The Tribunal
will now assess whether Respondent fulfilled its burden of proving that Mr. Pugachev’s
acquisition of French nationality was the result of a material error or fraud.

Respondent sustains that there is strong and compelling evidence that Claimant is not a
French national for purposes of the BIT. Indeed, Claimant did not meet the requirements
set out by French law to be granted nationality either by the Residence Route or by the
Exceptional Services Route. Moreover, Claimant did not fulfil the requirements common
to both routes. There is no other lawful route by which Claimant could have acquired French
nationality and hence the only conclusion is that Claimant acquired his French nationality
in a manner not compatible with international law.*°

On the contrary, Claimant claims that Respondent failed to meet its burden of bringing
decisive evidence of a material error or fraud committed by the French authorities. In
Claimant’s opinion, none of these two grounds (i.e. material error or fraud) arise from
Mr. Pugachev’s acquisition of French nationality and Respondent cannot convincingly
contend the contrary. Respondent solely based its arguments on mere assumptions and
scattered information with no probative value.4°

The Tribunal clarifies that it is not within its authority to assess whether the French
authorities have rightfully applied French law when conferring the French nationality to

Mr. Pugachev. The Tribunal will only examine the opposability of Mr. Pugachev’s French
nationality for the purposes of the present Arbitration.

I. Respondent failed to prove Mr. Pugachev acquired French nationality
through fraud

During this Arbitration, Respondent appears to have changed its argument of fraud. In its
Request for Bifurcation, Respondent asserted that “[...] Claimant’s alleged acquisition of
French nationality appears to be fraudulent, and in any event the Claimant remains a
Russian national.” “6 However, during the jurisdictional phase of the Arbitration,
Respondent nuanced its argument and claimed that “Respondent has already accepted that
the Tribunal would need to conclude that the Claimant acquired French nationality either
by error, fraud, or some other similar serious failing.”"°"

The Tribunal considers that fraud allegations are not to be taken lightly. In cases where the
alleged fraudulent measure was taken with respect to a naturalization procedure, the fraud
would also affect the sovereign State. In other words, claiming that Mr. Pugachev acquired
French nationality through fraud would most likely imply that the French Administration
colluded with Claimant in order to grant him French citizenship. These are serious
accusations that must be evaluated with the utmost rigor.

The Tribunal finds that, from the evidence on the record, it is not possible to conclude that
Mr. Pugachev concealed information from or provided incorrect information to the French
authorities. As further explained below, the Tribunal is aware that in Respondent’s view the
following information should have caused Mr. Pugachev’s naturalisation to be rejected:

a. he signed his naturalisation application in Moscow;
b. he had a temporary Schengen visa;

c. his wife was still living in Russia and she had no interest in being naturalised
French;

d. he was a Russian Senator; and

e. he provided a ten-month lease of his apartment when, in fact, he could have given
the property title of his house in Nice.‘

Having considered Respondent’s position in light of the evidence on the record, the only
abnormality that the Tribunal observes in Claimant’s Naturalisation File was
Mr. Pugachev’s omission to mention his new-born son. However, the Tribunal considers
that this omission does not amount to the category of “fraud”.

During the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Professor Jault-Seseke admitted that her allegation
regarding Mr. Pugachev’s new-born son (i.e. that his name was omitted illegally from
Claimant’s Naturalisation File) had been made without knowing whether Mr. Pugachev was
legally his father at the time of the application.“”? On the contrary, as explained by
Mr. Hourdin, the omission of a child could not have had any impact on the legality of the
Naturalisation Decree, in particular, as Mr. Pugachev did not ask for the naturalisation of
his children.4”°

The Tribunal finds worthy of note that, as explained by Mr. Hourdin, fraud is not just an
omission, because what matters is both the intentionality and the purpose of the fraud: “[...]
it must be voluntary, willful [...] dissimulation in the exclusive aim of obtaining French
nationality.”"'' In other words, an act of dishonesty amounts to fraud if it is made to obtain
an unjustified gain.

In this case, Mr. Pugachev had no gain in omitting his new-born son from Claimant’s
Naturalisation File, since his eldest sons were both listed in his application as living in
Russia.*"? As to Claimant’s argument according to which he did not mention his relationship
with Ms. Tolstoy in his naturalisation file due to personal considerations, the Tribunal finds
it of no value for the purposes of this Arbitration. Pure personal decisions cannot be
construed, ex-post, as a defence for not fulfilling a legal burden - nemo auditur propriam
turpitudinem allegans.

The Tribunal observes that Professor Jault-Seseke avoided to conclude on the existence of
fraud in her two expert reports.*'* In her First Expert Report, for instance, she only affirmed
that “[...] the request for naturalisation should have been declared inadmissible.?*\4
However, as Claimant points out, she failed to conclude to the existence of a material error
or fraud. Moreover, during the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Professor Jault-Seseke failed to
establish that Mr. Pugachev’s acquisition of French nationality was the result of fraud.*'>

Moreover, the expert reports of Professor Etienne Pataut and Mr. Hugues Hourdin argue
that Respondent’s conclusion is misconceived both under French law and in accordance
with the administrative practice, as it omits two essential aspects:

a. regardless of the route by which Claimant obtained his nationality, the French
Administration holds a discretionary power in matters of conferment of French
nationality that may go beyond the strict application of the texts; and

b. any challenge against Mr. Pugachev’s nationality would now be precluded under
French law.

In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that there are certain inconsistencies in Claimant’s
Naturalisation File and that it is not entirely clear whether the French government
considered Mr. Pugachev a resident for a time sufficient to qualify under the Residence
Route or one of the special cases under the Exceptional Service Route in which the French
Government may exercise an even wider discretion to grant naturalisation. However, for
this Tribunal, those inconsistencies do not amount to the level of “fraud”. Absent
compelling evidence showing that Mr. Pugachev acquired his French nationality
fraudulently, the Tribunal has no reason to overcome the sovereign decision adopted by the
French Administration.

2. Respondent failed to prove Mr. Pugachev acquired French nationality as a
result of a material error

The Parties have submitted multiple claims debating whether Mr. Pugachev fulfilled the
conditions set out in the French Civil Code and whether his naturalisation was the result of
a material error.

First, and as noted above, the Tribunal observes that Mr. Pugachev could have acquired his
French nationality either by (i) the Residence Route; or by (ii) the Exceptional Service
Route. The requirements and conditions for acquiring French nationality through each of
these routes are different and are subject to different procedures.

With regard to the Residence Route, the Tribunal understands that in order to acquire French
nationality through this route, a foreigner must fulfil certain conditions set out in the law.
These conditions include that the applicant:

a. must be 18 years old at the time of the request for French nationality;
b. must be “of good morality” and has not been subject to certain criminal convictions;

c. must justify his assimilation into the French community through, among other
factors, a sufficient knowledge of the French language and of the rights and
obligations granted by French nationality; and

d. must have been living in France for the last five years or, in exceptional cases, two
years, and the applicant must be residing regularly in France when the naturalisation
decree is signed.*!®

In addition to the above, the French Conseil d’Etat considers that the residency requirements
are only fulfilled if the applicant locates in France “the centre of his interests in a stable

330.

331.

332.

manner” The French Conseil d’Etat also considers that the five year residency period
must precede the application and only starts running when the applicant has fixed his centre
of interests in France.*!*

With regard to the Exceptional Service Route, the Tribunal observes that Article 21-19 of
the French Civil Code provides an exception from the requirement of a probationary period
in case of “exceptional services” or “important services” rendered to France. This Article
provides:

“The following persons may be naturalized without fulfilling the requirement of a
residential qualifying period:

LJ

6° A foreigner who gave exceptional services to France or one whose naturalization
is of exceptional interest for France. In this event, the naturalization decree can be
granted only after the advisory opinion issued by the Conseil d’Etat based on the
substantiated report of the competent minister.”*"”

The Parties disagree about whether naturalisation can only be granted after an advisory
opinion issued by the French Conseil d’Etat based on a justified proposal by the competent
Minister. Professor Pataut further explains that the distinction between “important services”
and “exceptional services” is at the sole discretion of the government.’?°

Second, the Tribunal is persuaded that the French Administration enjoys a wide margin of
appreciation in the assessment of the above-mentioned conditions.

As noted above, French authorities dispose of a large power of appreciation when assessing
the legal requirements for naturalisation. In this sense, as explained by Claimant, the French
Conseil d’Etat has defined naturalisation as “a favour granted by the French State to a
foreigner.””! The discretionary power of French authorities is brought to light, inter alia,
through the exceptions envisaged to the Residence Route by the French Civil Code itself.

The Tribunal agrees that naturalisation’s specific legal regime leads to judicial review that
is essentially limited to admissibility and that, in practice, exclusively relates to the refusal
decision. During the Hearing on Jurisdiction, it was further explained that the French Civil
Code imposes an obligation to motivate decisions to naturalise only if those decisions are
negative:

“[...] All of the disputes concerning nationality are disputes on the {...] limits of the
discretionary power of the State, [and] primarily aim at looking at whether the State

imposes an obli; to motivate decisions to naturalise only if those deci: are

negative.

In line with the above, the Tribunal invited Claimant to explain whether he acquired his
French nationality through an exception to the Residence Route; and, if that was the case,
which one of the exceptions to the Residence Route was applied to his case. In response to
the Tribunal’s question, Claimant explained that:

“At the time of his Request for Naturalisation, it was clear that his naturalisation
represented an interest to France. Indeed, he had been the owner of the French
company Hédiard for almost two years, and of an important number of shares in
France Soir.29 More importantly, Mr Pugachev was at the time of his request the
founder and sole shareholder of OPK group, which would be in charge of parts of
the construction of the Mistral ships in the Baltic Shipyards and therefore was
involved in the Mistral deal, a role that was known by the French authorities.

In this vein, as the Tribunal may note, Mr Pugachey listed the ownership of Hédiard
and OPK in his Request for Naturalisation, and also referred to his roles as a
Senator in Russia and as the President of the executive board of IIB.

Yet, as previously explained, the Administration is not required to include any

ing to its positive decisions when deciding to grant French nationality. This
is exactly the case of Claimant's naturalisation: there is no reasoning available as
to the Administration’s choice of a specific route and, in the absence of such a
justification, Claimant is not able to determine the exact route chosen by the French
authorities for granting him French nationality.”

The above explanation seems to be consistent with Professor Pataut’s expert report, which
stated that:

“This assessment is not intended to be challenged in court, as, by excellence, it is left
to the government's discretion. It is particularly noteworthy that no criterion makes
it possible to distinguish it from the simple reduction of the probati y period of
article 21-18, 2°, which reduces to two years the residence requirement of an
individual who "has rendered or may render by his capacities and talents important
services to France". In this case, the distinction between "important services" and
“exceptional services" - which is sometimes noted as "provoke[ing] smiles" - is
indeed the sole discretion of the government.”*

 

Moreover, the margin of appreciation is also relevant when the applicant is of interest to
France. According to the French Conseil d’Etat:

“Tthe administrative authority] [...] may, in_the exercise of this discretion, in
particular, take into account, when assessing the interest of granting the French
nationality, the integration of the individual concerned into French society, his or

her social and professional integration and the fact that he has the resources to
provide for his long term needs in France.”

336. In sum, the Tribunal agrees that the French authorities dispose of a large power of
appreciation and discretion when assessing the legal requirements for naturalisation. As a
result of the discretionary nature of the naturalisation procedure, the control by the
administrative courts is limited to a minimum."

337. Third, if Claimant was naturalized through the Residence Route, certain inconsistencies in
his naturalisation do not necessarily amount to a material error.

 

338. Respondent argues that it cannot be established that Claimant’s Request for Naturalisation
included all of the documents that, according to its interpretation of the requirements set out
under French law, were necessary to include in the application.’?’ Furthermore, Respondent
affirms that pages five and six of Claimant’s Request for Naturalisation are missing and
these pages should contain critical information about Claimant’s professional situation and
domicile that constitute the main elements taken into account by the French Conseil d’Etat
to verify the fulfilment of the residence requirements.*”*

339. Respondent also alleges that Claimant did not have his centre of interests in France during
the requisite period. As set out above, Respondent alleges that key requirements to establish
a “centre of interest” in France include the length and permanency of the residency in
France, and the location of the applicant’s “nuclear family”.*” In this regard, Respondent
argues that Claimant’s partner and children lived in London during the relevant period and
that Claimant’s Request for Naturalisation itself offers reasons for doubt because, inter alia,
it provides that Claimant’s former wife and two children were residing in Moscow, not
France.**° In addition, Respondent claims that Mr. Pugachev failed to respond that he was
residing in France during the relevant period.**!

340. It is also apparent that Claimant disclosed two passports with Schengen visas that allowed
a maximum stay duration of 90 days. In Respondent’s view, it can be inferred by this that
Mr. Pugachev was not allowed to stay in France (or in another Schengen State) for more
than 90 days until he was granted a residence permit in or around July 2009, i.e. just before
the Decree for Naturalisation was issued.**

341. Furthermore, Claimant failed to produce, when ordered to do so, copies of his passports
held between 1996 and 2016, alleging that they were not in his possession because these
were surrendered to the DIA and the Bank’s solicitors pursuant to the English
proceedings.*** However, the English court confirmed that Claimant had failed to deliver
his French passport. Claimant did not surrender his French passport and should have
produced it in this Arbitration.

342. Mr. Pugachev also produced his declarations to the tax authorities and a letter from the Safra
Bank which indicates that he was residing in the Russian Federation.**4 Respondent sustains
that these documents provide further substantive evidence that Claimant did not meet the
requirements under French law for naturalisation through the Residence Route.*>

343. Against this background, the Tribunal reiterates that naturalisation is, by essence, the
domain of sovereignty of the State and, accordingly, the French Administration disposes of
a large margin of appreciation in the assessment of the requirements.

344. Likewise, as pointed by Professor Etienne Pataut, because of the discretionary nature of the
naturalisation procedure, the control by the French administrative courts is limited.4*° Only
a gross error of qualification or analysis by the Administration will be likely to call into
question the validity of the decision to grant nationality.‘*’ In particular, Professor Etienne
Pataut explains that:

a. the assessment of the residence requirements is sufficiently broad to allow the
Administration a wide margin of manoeuvre; and

b. the respective weight to be given to each of the necessary criteria falls within the
sovereign discretion of the Administration. The Tribunal recognizes that the French
authorities dispose of a large power of appreciation when assessing the legal
requirements for naturalisation.***

345. Moreover, the Tribunal understands that decisions in favour of naturalisation are very rarely
contested because the individual who has benefited from them will not act against the
decree, and third parties will very rarely be able to challenge the validity of the

reveals that he was staying in France on the basis of a Schengen visa which allowed him only short stays of no
more than 90 days. This visa was issued in February 2008. It was only after his naturalization request filed on 20
April 2009 that Mr. Pugachev was granted a resident permit. As explained previously, with no long-term resident
permit, the condition of stability of the applicant’s residence as required by the applicable nationality law is not

met”.

naturalisation decree because there is no interest to do so. There is no evidence on the record
showing that Mr. Pugachev’s naturalisation has been challenged before French domestic
courts and that those courts assessed the legality of Claimant’s Naturalisation Decree. As
explained below, all legal actions that could be filed against Claimant’s Naturalisation
Decree are time-barred under French law.

346. The Tribunal also finds it plausible that a failure to have the family unit or material interests
in France can only become a reason for inadmissibility if no particular circumstances
emerge from the file, making it possible to put into perspective the importance of such
ties.4° In other words, a global appreciation of the elements may be undertaken and the
respective weight to be given to each of the necessary criteria falls within the sovereign
discretion of the Administration.”

347. Finally, the Tribunal considers that if Mr. Pugachev was naturalized through the Residence
Route, such naturalisation inevitably displays certain inconsistencies. However, from the
evidence on the record, it is unclear whether Claimant was naturalized by way of the
Residence Route and, accordingly, whether the Residence Route’s requirements applied to
his case. Instead, the evidence on the record suggests that it is likely that the French
authorities granted naturalization through the Special Services Route. Thus, and bearing in
mind the Tribunal’s findings as to the French Administration’s wide margin of appreciation,
the Tribunal cannot conclude from the evidence on the record that Mr. Pugachev was
naturalized through the Resident Route, and if so, that the apparent inconsistencies in
Mr. Pugachev’s naturalisation raise to the level of “material error”.

348. Fourth, Claimant’s naturalisation was not granted in a specific decree issued specifically for
Claimant but in a collective decree involving various individuals.

349. The cases cited by Claimant reveal that the French Administration can make a choice of
pure expediency and issue a decree of naturalisation without necessarily having to follow
the “exceptional” path through the French Conseil d’Etat.

350. Respondent contends, inter alia, that in the case of an Exceptional Services Route, it would
have been necessary for the competent Minister to prepare a report and for the French
Conseil d’Etat to issue an opinion, but Claimant’s Naturalisation File does not contain such
report. “4! Moreover, Professor Jault-Seseke compared Mr. Mamadou Gassama’s
naturalisation decree for exceptional services with Claimant’s and found that:

“Tw]hile the latter [Mr Gassama’s] is a collective decree simply referring, among
various names of naturalized persons, to that of Mr. Pugachev, the former is an
individual decree which refers to the various specificities of the naturalization

framework. Mr. Gassama’s naturalization decree indicates that it was issued on the
basis of the report made by the Minister of the Interior; it refers explicitly to various
articles of the Civil Code including Article 21-19, 6°, as well as to the naturalization
request; it specifies that the Conseil d’Etat has been heard.”*“?

In contrast with the above, Claimant submits that Mr. Antony Sandler, Mr. Alek Skarlatos
and Mr. Spencer Stone (i.e. the three American heroes from the Thalys train) were granted
French nationality on 18 September 2018.“? These three Americans who had never lived
in France and have no knowledge of the French tongue had their names included within a
collective decree, among various names of naturalised individuals, similar to Claimant’s
Naturalisation Decree.“

During the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Respondent’s expert recognized that the three
Americans had indeed been naturalised French for exceptional services by means of a
collective decree.““* This would also show that the French authorities have a discretionary
power to refuse naturalisation in circumstances where the applicable conditions are met and
also to admit naturalisation where the applicable conditions are not fulfilled.

The Tribunal is persuaded that this form of naturalisation through a collective decree, with
no reference to the various specificities of the naturalisation framework, could be the result
of the French Administration’s margin of appreciation and of the existence of an expediency
choice in this matter. Just as for the three Americans, the French Administration may have
used its discretionary power to examine Mr. Pugachev’s situation.

However, the question remains why Mr. Pugachev represented a special interest to France
for his “exceptional services” or “important services”. In Claimant’s view, there were
different elements in Claimant’s Naturalisation File that prove his interest to France. These
include, inter alia:

“Mr Pugachev indicated in his Request for Naturalisation that his father, mother
and sister lived in Beausoleil (France);

One of his children, Mr Alexander Pugachev, was already French at the time of his
Request for Naturalisation;

Mr Pugachev declared he was the owner of the French company Hédiar since 2007
(among other companies); As previously explained, Hédiar was considered as the
flagship of the French luxury market and was founded in 1854. It included the largest
food products chain in the world, with more than 120 shops in more than 30 different
countries. Mr Pugachev invested more than EUR 100 million into Hédiard.

The complete version of Exhibit R-84, refers to a short-stay visa for family reasons
from 26 February 2008 to 25 February 2012 (1460 days), i.e. 365 days per year."

In addition, in his response to the Tribunal’s Questions, Claimant expressed that:

“At the time of his Request for Naturalisation, it was clear that his naturalisation
represented an interest to France. Indeed, he had been the owner of the French
company Hédiard for almost two years, and of an important number of shares in
France Soir. More importantly, Mr Pugachev was at the time of his request the
founder and sole shareholder of OPK group, which would be in charge of parts of
the construction of the Mistral ships in the Baltic Shipyards and therefore was
involved in the Mistral deal, a role that was known by the French authorities.

In this vein, as the Tribunal may note, Mr Pugachey listed the ownership of Hédiard
and OPK in his Request for Naturalisation, and also referred to his roles as a
Senator in Russia and as the President of the executive board of IIB."

Likewise, Claimant submits that his involvement in the Mistral deal was of key importance
to France. According to Claimant, the Mistral contract was negotiated between 2008 and
2011, between France and Russia. It provided for the sale of two Mistral ships, to be
constructed in part at the Baltic Shipyards, owned by Mr. Pugachev and from which he was
allegedly expropriated in 2011 by the Russian Federation. Mr. Pugachev promoted the
government-to-government deal between France and Russia and had an important role in
bringing such deal to France.“*

It is not for this Tribunal to assess whether Mr. Pugachev rendered “exceptional services to
France” or whether he was of “an exceptional interest to France”. That is a matter within
the wide margin of appreciation of the French Administration and there is no evidence that
allows to conclude that Claimant’s naturalisation amounts to a “material error” of
assessment by the said Administration.

Fifth, no challenge of Mr. Pugachev’s French nationality is available under French law.

The Tribunal already found that under French law the decision of the French Administration
is presumed to be legal unless otherwise proven. Now, the Tribunal will examine whether
any purported non-fulfilment of the conditions for naturalisation set forth under French law
could have legal consequences regarding the validity of Mr. Pugachev’s French nationality.

360. As a preliminary point, the Tribunal shares Professor Pataut’s reservation as regards to
whether a foreign State could act before the administrative courts to challenge a
naturalisation decision for lack of interest and lack of standing.”

361. Despite this probable lack of standing preventing Respondent to contest the French
authorities’ decision to grant Claimant the French nationality, Professor Etienne Pataut and
Mr. Hugues Hourdin have assessed the three possible recourses against said decision. These
include (i) an action for misuse of power, (ii) the withdrawal of the naturalisation decree
and, finally, (iii) an objection of illegality in the ambit of another dispute.

362. The first possibility for challenging a naturalisation decree would be that of an appeal for
misuse of power, which is open against any administrative act within two months as from
its notification (by the person who is concerned by such decision) or within two months of
its publication (by an interested third party).4° This deadline has expired in the case of Mr.
Pugachev, whose Naturalisation Decree is dated 30 November 2009.

363. The second possibility is that, under certain conditions, a naturalisation decree may be
withdrawn by the State, with the assent of the French Conseil d’Etat. Such an action is
provided under Article 27-2 of the French Civil Code, that provides:

“A decree deciding naturalisation or reinstatement may be withdrawn with assent of
the Conseil d’Etat within one year after its publication in the Journal Officiel where
the person making the request does not comply with the statutory requirements;
where the decision was obtained by lie or fraud, the decree may be withdrawn within
two years from the detection of fraud.”*>'

364. Any withdrawal for material error would be time-barred one year after the publication of
the Naturalisation Decree, i.e. one year after its release in the Journal official de la
République francaise dated 2 December 2009.4?

365. Finally, a naturalisation decree could also be indirectly contested before judicial courts
pursuant to Article 29 of the French Civil Code.*? Both Professor Pataut and Mr. Hugues
Hourdin consider that a naturalisation decree is an individual administrative act. **
Consequently, the plea of illegality cannot be invoked before courts beyond the normal time
limit for appeal against the administrative decision, as held by the civil courts.

455 Respondent’s Reply on Juris

The Tribunal is persuaded that no legal or administrative action is available under French
law to challenge Mr. Pugachev’s French nationality. This means that Claimant’s
Naturalisation Decree is an administrative decision presumed to be legal under French law,
and whose legality cannot be contested before the French courts. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Tribunal is aware that Respondent is not seeking to take recourse under French law in
respect of Claimant’s Naturalisation Decree, but rather, that it is seeking to have the
Tribunal assess, under international law and the Treaty, its jurisdiction over the dispute. As
a result, whether Claimant’s nationality remains capable of challenge or revocation under
French law is not material to the question of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the Treaty,
which is a question of international law.

In conclusion, absent any compelling evidence showing that Mr. Pugachev acquired his
French nationality fraudulently or as a result of a material error, the Tribunal has no reason
to overcome the sovereign discretionary decision taken by the French Administration.

Dual nationals are not excluded from the Treaty

The Parties dispute whether dual nationals are excluded from the Treaty and whether
Claimant renounced to his Russian nationality in 2012. Having carefully analysed the
Parties’ submissions in this regard, the Tribunal finds that dual nationals are not excluded
from the Treaty. In consequence, the Tribunal will not assess whether Claimant effectively
renounced to his Russian nationality or whether the principle of dominant and effective
nationality applies to this case.

Respondent submits that the Treaty is not silent as to dual nationals, but rather that it
expressly excludes them from its scope. When Article 1.2(a) of the BIT is interpreted in
light of Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT, it is evident that the parties to the Treaty only
intended to protect the investors of the State not hosting the investment.**

Further, Respondent alleges that, contrary to Claimant’s assertion in his Counter-Memorial
on Jurisdiction, Respondent did not “search for the intention of the signatories” as such but
deduced such intention from the specific wording of the BIT, as required by the VCLT.
Claimant, therefore, does not qualify as an investor under the Treaty.4°°

On the contrary, Claimant asserts that Article 1.2(a) of the Treaty contains no restriction
regarding investors holding both French and Russian citizenship in accordance with the
ordinary meaning of its terms. In any event, even if the Arbitral Tribunal were to interpret
Article 1.2 of the Treaty in light of its context, the entirety of the France-USSR BIT does
not exclude dual nationals from its scope.’*”

Likewise, Claimant affirms that Respondent should be precluded from objecting to
Mr. Pugachev’s standing as a foreign investor under Article 1.2 of the Treaty, because only
a few months earlier its own courts deemed that he is a foreigner and, therefore, subject to

the procedure of notification of decisions applicable thereto.** Claimant further upholds

that dual nationals are foreigners with respect to their respective home State as citizens of

another and, accordingly, their investments should be afforded protection.*?

373. From the outset, the Tribunal observes that Article 1.2(a) of the Treaty does not contain an
express exclusion of dual nationals. Article 1.2(a) of the Treaty provides that:

“The term “investor” shall signify: a) Any natural person who is a national of one
of the Contracting Parties and who is allowed, in accordance with the laws of that
Contracting Party, to make investments on the territory or in the maritime zone of
the other Contracting Party.“

 

374. It is a general principle of international law that treaty provisions should be given their
natural and ordinary meaning. This was expressly recognised by the ICJ in its Advisory
Opinion on the Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of a State to the
United Nations in 1950.“ This customary principle of treaty interpretation was later
codified under Article 31 of the VCLT as the “general rule of interpretation” of treaties.

375. Article 31(1) of the VCLT provides that:

“J. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its
object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in
addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in
connexion with the conclusion of the treaty; (b) any instrument which was made by
one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by
the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of
the treaty or the application of its provisions; (b) any subsequent practice in the
application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its
interpretation; (c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations
between the parties.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so
intended.“

Pursuant to Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the Treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in
accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the Treaty. In this sense,
unless the Treaty’s terms are obscure or unreasonable, they must be interpreted within the
limits of its own terms.

Article 31 of the VCLT expresses the general rule for the interpretation of treaties. This
requires interpretation in good faith. This principle, which flows directly from the rule of
pacta sunt servanda, means that good faith implies elements of reasonableness that go
beyond the mere literal interpretation of a term as well as consideration of the object and
purpose, while recurring to supplementary means of interpretation.

The Tribunal views Article 31 as a set of elements for interpretation that are to be
appreciated in the context and circumstances of the particular case. Article 31 as a whole -
including all of its paragraphs and not limited to the standpoint of Article 31(1) - is an
integral single rule for interpretation of treaties. This is underscored by the fact that Article
31 is entitled the “General Rule [in the singular] of Interpretation”. In this process, the
interpreter shall consider the ordinary meaning of the words, in their context, and taking
into account the object and purpose of the treaty. The ordinary meaning may not reveal a
single meaning, which explains why it must be considered in the context of the treaty.

However, although object, purpose and context, as well as the other rules of interpretation
can all provide the interpreter with important guidance and can lead the interpreter to discern
the meaning in a treaty provision, they cannot be used to negate the meaning of a treaty
provision if that meaning is plain and if that interpretation is consonant with the treaty’s
object and purpose and any other relevant context. In other words, treaty interpretation is a
way of establishing shared intent, but cannot be used as a process to make contextual or
purposeful hurdle, in order to give effect to the parties’ intent, if expressed plainly.

This implies, inter alia, that the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of a treaty is the
starting point in the interpretative analysis. As noted by the tribunal in Suez v Argentina:

“In interpreting these provisions, the Tribunal is guided by established principles of
treaty interpretation as provided by Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law
of Treaties, pursuant to which treaty language is to be interpreted in accordance

with its ‘ordinary meaning.’ In that respect, t the text of the treaty is presumed to be

the. i expression of the parties’ The starting place for any exercise

 

 

The Tribunal agrees with the reasoning of the tribunal in Pey Casado in which a dual
Chilean and Spanish citizen sought protection under the Spain-Chile BIT:

“To meet the nationality condition under the BIT, it is sufficient for the claimant to
demonstrate that it holds the nationality of one of the contracting States. Contrary
to the respondent's claim, the fact that the claimant holds a dual nationality,

including the nationality of the respondent, does not exclude it from the scope of the
BIT.

LJ

The BIT does not expressly deal with the question of whether or not dual Spanish
and Chilean citizens are covered by its scope. In the arbitral Tribunal opinion, it is
not justified to add (on the basis of alleged rules of customary international law) a
condition which does not result either from its terms or from its spirit.”**

The Tribunal is of the opinion that, where the Treaty does not require an investor to be the
national of only one of the Contracting Parties, the Tribunal cannot add a condition that is
not provided for in the Treaty. In other words, the Tribunal cannot create a distinction not
made in the text and context of the Treaty. If the Tribunal were to adopt this route, it would
impose upon the Parties a definition of “investor” other than the one agreed upon by the
Contracting States.

Having thoroughly examined the arguments submitted by both Parties, the Tribunal
observes that Article 1.2(a) of the Treaty merely requires an investor to be a national of one
of the Contracting Parties and be allowed, in accordance with the laws of the non-host State,
to make investments in the territory of the other party. The Treaty does not require that the
investor hold only one nationality, nor does it impose further conditions. In other words,
from a reading of the Treaty in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms, there is
no reason to conclude that dual nationals are excluded. The expressions “one” and “other”
in Article 1.2(a) only seek to establish that an investor must have at least one nationality
different from the home state of the investment.

Moreover, the Tribunal notes that, contrary to the ICSID Convention, which expressly
excludes dual nationals in its Article 25, the UNCITRAL Rules do not contain any such
restriction. The issue of dual nationality should be resolved considering the Treaty, as it is
the /ex specialis between the Parties.

In fact, the Contracting States could have chosen to include a restriction for dual nationals
but did not include it in the Treaty. It is worthy of note that France has expressly excluded
dual nationals from the scope of the bilateral investment treaties concluded with Ethiopia,
China, Kazakhstan, and Uruguay.*® Likewise, Russia included a similar provision in
Article 1.2 of the treaty concluded with Iran, which provides that:

“The term "investor" with respect to any of the Contracting Parties shall refer to: (a)
Individuals who, in accordance with the laws and regulations of that Contracting

Party are citizens of its State and do not have the citizenship of the State of the

Contracting Party in whose territory the Investments were made.”

386. Accordingly, if either of the Contracting States had intended to exclude dual nationals from
the scope of the France-USSR BIT, they would have done so expressly.

387. Insum, the Tribunal observes that, according to the ordinary meaning of the Treaty’s terms,
Article 1.2(a) grants protection to investors having the citizenship of one of the signatories
and having made an investment in the territory of the other state. The Treaty does not
contain any restriction regarding investors holding both French and Russian citizenship.

388. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal concludes that dual nationals are not excluded
from the Treaty’s scope of protection. Even if Claimant held the nationality of France and
the nationality of Russia, it does not disqualify him as an investor under the Treaty.

D. The Treaty requires Claimant to have held French nationality at the time he made his
alleged investments

389. It is common ground between the Parties that the date of the alleged violation of the Treaty
and the date of the commencement of the arbitral proceedings are relevant dates for
assessing Claimant’s nationality. For this reason, the Tribunal will deal only with the issue
in dispute, i.e. whether Claimant was required to have held French nationality at the time
he made his alleged investments.

390. Respondent submits that the Treaty requires Claimant to have held French nationality at the
time he made his alleged investments as well as at the time of the alleged Treaty’s breaches.
Respondent invokes Article 1.2(a) of the Treaty to argue that an investor is required to hold
the nationality of the non-host State at the time the investment is made.

391. Under Article 1.2(a) of the Treaty, a protected investor is: “a national of one of the
Contracting Parties and who is allowed, in accordance with the laws of that Contracting
Party, to make investments on the territory [...] of the other Contracting Party”. In
Respondent’s view, Article 1.2(a) creates a temporal requirement according to which, in
order to qualify as an “investor”, a natural person must be a national when he or she makes

event that these individuals are, or were at the time of the investment, living outside of the territory of the
contracting Party in which the investment was made”).

the investments. At the time a national makes the investment, he or she must be permitted
to do so in accordance with the national law of the non-host State.”

Respondent adds that the above-mentioned reading of Article 1.2(a) is “obvious”. However,
if support for it is required, it can be found throughout the Treaty, which repeatedly refers
to investments “made” and not simply “held”. In any event, the Treaty should be interpreted
in accordance with Article 31(1) of the VCLT, i.e. in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning, context, object and purpose of the BIT. Respondent claims that its
interpretation of the BIT gives the words their ordinary meaning and that the word “make”
entails the creation of an investment."

Furthermore, Respondent asserts that its position is supported by Professor Rodrigo
Oreamuno’s dissenting opinion in Serafin Garcia v Venezuela. Unlike the authorities on
which Claimant relies, the definition of “investor” in the Spain-Venezuela bilateral treaty is
close to that of the Treaty.“

On the contrary, Claimant alleges that the BIT does not require Claimant to hold French
nationality at the time of the making of the investment in order to qualify as a protected
investor.

Claimant argues that Article 1.2(a) of the Treaty sets out two clear conditions to qualify as
a protected “investor” under the BIT: (i) be a national of France and (ii) be authorized by
French law to make investments in Russia. In Claimant’s view, Article 1.2(a) does not
require that the investor hold the relevant nationality at the time the investment is made and
nothing in the wording evidences that such special meaning is to be given to these terms.*”°

In addition, Claimant asserts that even if the wording of Article 1.2(a) justifies an
interpretation, Respondent’s proposed reading (i) is not based on an ordinary reading of
Article 1.2(a); and (ii) eludes that the verb “make”, on which it exclusively relies, is used
in the present tense — “who is allowed [...] to make investments” instead of “who has been
allowed to make investments”. Consequently, a natural person will qualify as a protected
investor if he or she “is allowed to make investments” in Russia, in accordance with French
law. This requirement is obviously not one of timing but one of legality, aimed at ensuring
that the investor is legally capable under French law to make, hold, and manage investments
on the Russian territory.47!

Having carefully analysed the arguments put forward by both Parties, the majority of the
Tribunal finds that (a) the Treaty requires Claimant to have held French nationality at the
time he made his alleged investments; and (b) that Claimant did not hold French nationality
at the date of his alleged investments.

a) The Treaty requires Claimant to have held French nationality at the time he made

his alleged investments

398. It is well settled under international law that the foreignness of the investment is determined
by the investor’s nationality. If the investor wishes to have the protection of a determined
treaty, it must show that it has the nationality of one of the two State parties. In this regard,
the investor’s nationality is relevant for at least two purposes: (i) the substantive standards
guaranteed in a treaty will only apply to the respective national; and (ii) the jurisdiction of

a tribunal is determined, infer alia, by a claimant’s nationality.

399. In the present case, the Parties debate whether Claimant was required to have held French
nationality at the time he made his alleged investments. At the core of both Parties’ positions
figures Article 1.2(a) of the Treaty, which, according to the English translation of the Treaty

submitted by Claimant, provides:

“The term “investor” shall signify: a) Any natural person who is a national of one
of the Contracting Parties and who is allowed, in accordance with the laws of that
Contracting Party, to make investments on the territory or in the maritime zone of

72

the other Contracting Party;

 

400. Both Parties have grounded their arguments on the interpretation of the Treaty in accordance
with Article 31 of the VCLT. In accordance with this Article, the terms of the Treaty should
be given their ordinary meaning in their context and in light of the object and purpose of

the Treaty. Article 31 of the VCLT provides that:

“1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its

object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in
addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in
connexion with the conclusion of the treaty; (b) any instrument which was made by
one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by
the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so
intended."

401. Pursuant to Article 31 of the VCLT, the Treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in
accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms and in the light of its object and purpose.
The VCLT defines what should be understood by “context” for the purposes of
interpretation, in addition to the text of the treaty itself, its preamble and its potential
annexes.

402. In addition, Article 32 of the VCLT contemplates supplementary means of interpretation to
complement Article 31. Article 32 provides as follows:

“Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the
preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to
confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the
meaning when the interpretation according to article 31: (a) leaves the meaning
ambiguous or obscure; or (b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or
unreasonable.”

403. Claimant argues that the supplementary means of interpretation provided in Article 32 of
the VCLT can only be relied upon if the interpretation carried out according to Article 31
leads to an ambiguous or manifestly absurd or unreasonable consequence.*” The Tribunal
disagrees. Article 32 expressly permits the use of supplementary means also to “confirm the
meaning resulting from the application of Article 31”. This position has been endorsed by
the International Law Commission.*”°

404. The Tribunal will analyse Article 1.2(a) of the Treaty in accordance with the VCLT and the
arguments put forward by both Parties.

405. First, the Tribunal draws its attention to the very particular wording of Article 1.2(a). In
particular, the Tribunal observes that this Article requires a specific authorization under
national law in order to be considered a protected investor under the Treaty:

“The term “investor” shall signify: a) Any natural person who is a national of one

of the Contracting Parties and who is allowed, in accordance with the laws of that
Contracting Party, to make investments on the territory or in the maritime zone of

the other Contracting Party;**”"

The French text, which is one of the original languages of the BIT (the other one being
Russian) provides as follows:

“Le terme “investisseur” désigne a) Toute personne physique qui posséde la

nationalité de l'une des Parties contractantes et qui peut conformément a la
législation de cette Partie contractante, effectuer des investissements sur le territoire
ou dans la zone maritime de l'autre Partie contractante.”

Pursuant to Article 1.2(a), in order to qualify as an investor, a person has to be authorised
according to the laws of his nationality (in this case the laws of France) to make investments
in the territory of the other Contracting Party (in this case the Russian Federation). This
understanding of Article 1.2(a) is not disputed by the Parties.*”* The real matter of
controversy between the Parties is whether Article 1.2(a) of the Treaty implies that the
authorization according to the laws of the investor of the non-host State should be assessed
before the making of the investment. As Claimant explains in his Rejoinder on Jurisdiction:

“Although Claimant agrees with Respondent that the investing party must have the
capacity pursuant to the laws of his nationality to make investments in the territory
of the other Contracting Party, the wording of Article 1.2(a) of the Treaty does not
suggest that such a capacity should be assessed before the making of the
investment."

On this point, Claimant submits that Article 1.2(a) uses the present tense (“who is allowed”)
and not the past (“was allowed”) and does not refer to a specific investment made by the
investor but to the general formulation “to make investments”. Therefore, the reference to
the law of the State of nationality only serves to ensure that the investor can lawfully make
investments according to the said law once he invokes the Treaty protection.

The majority of the Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimant’s reading of Article 1.2(a), and,
particularly, by his argument according to which the issue is a matter of legality and not of
timing.“*° Claimant submits that the language of the aforesaid Article only serves to ensure
that the investor can lawfully make investments according to the said law when he invokes
the protection under the Treaty. The Parties do not disagree that the investor must be
authorized by the law of his or her home State to invest in the other contracting State. They
disagree as to when the investor needs to have such authorization. Hence, this confirms that
the issue in debate is one of timing, not only legality. The question is whether the investor
of one contracting party must be authorized to make investments in the territory of other
contracting party prior to making the investment (as claimed by Respondent) or prior to
invoking the protection of the Treaty (as claimed by Claimant).

The Tribunal agrees with Claimant on the fact that Article 1.2(a) uses the present tense
(“who is a national”, “who is allowed” and “make investments”) (“qui posséde, “qui peut”
and “effectuer” in the French original). However, for the majority of the Tribunal, the fact
that the article is drafted in the present tense and not in the past tense does not allow to

conclude, as Claimant does, that it refers to the time at which the investor makes the claim
under the BIT. On the contrary, being redacted in the present tense means, for the majority
of the Tribunal, that the verb used in the text of Article 1.2(a) is neutral with respect to the
timing at which the investor must be authorized by the law of his or her home State to make
investments in the other contracting State. Therefore, both interpretations of the text alone,
the one of Claimant and the one of Respondent, are plausible if the Tribunal were to simply
follow the common use of the words.

Second, according to the definition of “investor” in Article 2.1(a) of the BIT, the investor
must be authorized to make investments in the territory of the other contracting party
(“effectuer des investissements” in the French original). Article 1 of the BIT defines
“investment” as “goods and rights of any kind, and more specifically but not exclusively”
followed by a non-exhaustive list of assets and rights. Article 1 further provides that the
term investment “shall also indicate indirect investments made by investors of one of the
Contracting Parties on the territory or in the maritime zone of the other Contracting Party
through the intermediary of an investor of a third country”.

The BIT, therefore, clearly authorizes the so-called “indirect investments” and thus the
debate as to whether Article 1.2(a) of the BIT refers to “investments held” or “investments
made” is entirely different from the debate related to indirect investments that has taken
place in other investment disputes. Moreover, Article 1.2(a) of the BIT refers exclusively
to investments made by natural persons — not legal entities. The definition of “investment”
of legal entities is contained in Article 1.2(b) of the Treaty. Therefore, this is not a case
where the parties are debating a change of domicile of a corporation, or a corporate
restructuring, or which company in a chain of control should be considered for purposes of
a given treaty. For the majority of the Tribunal, this case refers exclusively to alleged
investments made by an individual in Russia, and to whether such individual, born Russian
and who acquired the French nationality after making the investments, must have had the
French nationality at the time the investments were made.

For the majority of the Tribunal, the Treaty clearly refers to investments made
(“investissements effectués” or “investissement réalisé”) and not to investments held
(“investissements détenus”’). Nothing in the BIT - or for that matter in the French language
or in the English language to which the BIT was translated by Claimant -, would allow the

Tribunal to conclude that the terms “made” (“effectués” or “réalisé”) and the term “held”
(“détenus”) are synonymous or have the same meaning.

Third, the majority of the Tribunal considers that this understanding is further supported by
examining other provisions of the Treaty in their context. The Treaty consistently refers to
investments “made” by the investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other
Contracting Party, it does not refer in any way to investments “held” by this person. For
example:

a. Article 1.1 defines the term “investments” as “assets such as goods and rights of
any kind” which shall “be or must have been invested in accordance with the laws

415.

416.

°

of the Contracting Party on whose territory or in whose maritime zone the
investment is made”.

b. Article 1.2(a) defines the term “investors” as “[a]ny natural person who is a national

of one of the Contracting Parties and who is permitted in accordance with the laws
of that Contracting Party, to make investments on the territory or in the maritime
zone of the other Contracting Party”.

Article 7, which contains the arbitration clause, provides that the Tribunal has
jurisdiction to decide on the disputes arising between “one of the Contracting
Parties and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning the effects of a
measure taken by the first Contracting Party and relating to the management,
maintenance, enjoyment or disposal of an investment made by such investor [...]”.

d. Article 3.1 similarly provides that each contracting party shall ensure fair and

equitable treatment to the “investments _made_by the investors of the other
contracting Party”.

e. Article 4.1 also provides: “[i]nvestments made by investors of one or the other of

the contracting Parties shall enjoy full and complete protection and security on the
territory and in the maritime zone of the other Contracting Party”.

f. Article 8 of the BIT likewise provides: “[e]ach Contracting Party shall observe all

commitments made with regard to an investor of the other Contracting Party in
relation to an investment made by such investor on the territory or in the maritime
zone of the first Contracting Party”.

Fourth, the Tribunal majority’s reading of Article 1.2(a) is also supported by the object and
purpose of the Treaty. The preamble of the Treaty is clear in that its aim was the promotion
of foreign investment by nationals of one State into the other State:

“Wishing to strengthen the economic and commercial ties as well as the scientific
and technical cooperation between the two States in their mutual interest and to
create bl. ditions for French i in the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics and Soviet investments in France;

 

Convinced that the reciprocal promotion and protection of these investments are apt
to late the transfer of capital and the exch of leading-ed; hnolovi

between the two States in the interest of their economic development.”***

For the majority of the Tribunal, according to the preamble of the Treaty, this promotion of
foreign investment from one State to the other can only be accomplished if, on the one hand,

482 Exhibit CL-1, Agreement Between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the United

the investor of one of the State parties to the BIT makes — not simply holds — an investment
in the territory of the other State party; and if, on the other hand, the investment is made by
way of a transfer of capital or the exchange of leading-edge technologies between the two
States in the interest of their economic development.

Therefore, the majority of the Tribunal considers that the language of the Treaty requires
that an investment, in order to be protected, must be (i) transnational (cross-border) from
inception, (ii) made through the transfer of capital and the exchange of leading-edge
technology and (iii) made by an investor of one of the Contracting Parties. As noted above,
the Treaty refers to investments made (“investissements effectués” or “investissement
réalisé’) by a national of one Contracting Party on the territory of the other Contracting
Party, rather than investments simply held.

For the majority of the Tribunal, an investment cannot be “made” on the date on which the
investor seeks for the protection under the Treaty, as claimed by Claimant. On that date, the
investment has already been made, the transfer of capital should have already occurred,
otherwise there would be no investment. The investment is made, according to the BIT,
when the investor acquires, in accordance with the law of the host State, any of the assets
and rights listed in Article 1 of the BIT and a transfer of capital takes place. The Treaty
requires the investor to be allowed, in accordance with the laws of that Contracting State,
to make investments, i.e. to make a transfer of capital to the other Contracting State. It is a
necessary consequence of the references to investments “made” rather than investments
“held”, that the nationality condition must be fulfilled at the time of the making of the
investment.

From this perspective, the Treaty does not protect investments simply held by nationals of
the other Contracting Party at the time of claiming protection under the Treaty. Therefore,
for the majority of the Tribunal, the relevant date for purposes of determining when the
investor should have been authorized by the law of his or her State to make an investment
in the other contracting State is the date on which the investment was made.

Therefore, in the instant case, in the opinion of the majority of the Tribunal, for
Mr. Pugachev to be considered an investor under the Treaty, he must have held the French
nationality, must have been authorized to make an investment on the date on which the
investment was made, and should have made the investment, i.e. the transfer of capital, as
a French national.

Fifth, Claimant invokes the dissenting opinion of Professor Oreamuno in Serafin Garcia v
Venezuela, where the applicable Spain- Venezuela BIT defined “investors” as “any physical
person who possesses nationality of one Contracting Party pursuant to its legislation and
makes investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party”, and “investments” as
“any kind of assets invested by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the
other Contracting Party”. In view of these provisions, Professor Oreamuno considered that:

“[...] There is no doubt that, in order for a person to be deemed an investor and,
consequently, for his or her investment to be protected (under the BIT], that person

Award on Jurisdiction
18 June 2020
Page 92 of 112

must possess the nationality of one of the Contracting Parties when making such

investment in the territory of the other.

422. Claimant rightly points out that Professor Oreamuno’s position in Serafin Garcia v
Venezuela was a dissenting opinion. Professor Oreamuno’s opinion was endorsed by the
Paris Court of Appeal which had to decide on an application to set aside the award. In a
decision dated 25 April 2017, the Court ruled that:

“Considering that according to the ordinary meaning to be given to these terms, the
investment is not an asset simply “held” by an investor of the other contracting Party
— which would exclude any reference to the date of acquisition - but an asset
“invested” by an investor of the other contracting Party — which necessarily refers
to a condition of nationality of the investor at the date of the investment.”

423. The majority of the Tribunal is mindful that there are obvious differences in the wording of
each treaty, and that the treaty analysed by the Paris Court of Appeal did not have the
specific language on legal authorization contained in the BIT. However, Respondent is
correct in that the Court of Appeal highlighted the difference between “making” an
investment and “holding” an investment. According to the ordinary meaning of Article
1.2(a), “to make investments” cannot be assimilated to simply “held an investment”.

424. Whilst the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal was set aside by the French Cour de
cassation in February 2019, as rightfully emphasized by Claimant, this was on procedural
grounds (i.e. that the Paris Court of Appeal was required to set aside the decision on
jurisdiction in its entirety but had done so only partially).“** The decision of the Cour de
cassation did not disturb, or even criticise, the findings of the Paris Court of Appeal in
relation to issues of nationality on which the Respondent relies.

425. Sixth, the majority of the Tribunal considers that Claimant’s interpretation of Articles 1.1
and 10 of the Treaty do not support his case.

426. The Parties dispute the extent to which Article 10 would affect the investor’s nationality
requirement. Treaties often contain a provision (such as the one contained in Article 10) to
the effect of extending the protection conferred therein to investments made prior to the
treaty’s entry into force. In Claimant’s view, such provision entails that requirements
pertaining to the nationality of the investment are not relevant nor applicable to the date of

the making of the investments since the treaty was not even in force for investments made
before January 1950 and these investments will still be protected.**®

The majority of the Tribunal finds that Claimant’s argument based on his interpretation of
Article 10 does not stand up to scrutiny. Article 10 of the Treaty refers to the ratione
temporis jurisdiction of the Tribunal, rather than to its ratione personae jurisdiction that is
the one under analysis. For the majority of the Tribunal, the fact that the Treaty applies to
investments made prior to its entry into force does not change the requirements pertaining
to the nationality of the investor imposed by Article 1.2(a), i.e. that Claimant must hold the
relevant nationality at the date the investments are made, whether such an investment is
made before or after the Treaty’s entry into force.

Further, Claimant contends that the definition of investments under Article 1.1 of the Treaty
provides for protected investments that are in practice “held” by the investor rather than

forms of equity [...]”, or “copyrights, industrial property rights [...].” Thus, it is false to
assert that an investment can only be “made” under the BIT as Respondent does.**” The
majority of the Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument either. On the contrary, it

“made”, such as “movable and immovable assets and rights in rem”, “shares and other

considers that the assets mentioned by Claimant can be “made”, for example, when an
investor acquires them or when such rights or assets are transferred by the corresponding
method to transfer property.

Seventh, even though the reasoning above will be sufficient for the conclusions of the
majority as to the of the meaning of Article 1.2(a), such meaning is also confirmed by the
historical context in which the Treaty was drafted. During the Hearing on Jurisdiction,
Respondent explained that the wording of Article 1.2(a) could be explained by the
circumstances of the Treaty’s conclusion:

“The history or background to such an unusual provision is that in Russia -- well,
first of all, it is 1989. 1989 is Soviet Union. So the Berlin Wall collapsed in 1991. So
1989 is the treaty dated. It is ratified in 1991. But the text is Soviet. And in the Soviet
Union there were very strict restrictions as to who could carry out foreign trade. So
you need to be allowed by Soviet law to do foreign transactions, to invest outside of
Soviet Union. That's why this treaty -- this provision is here, which suggests that if
you are Soviet or Russian and you are making an investment in France, you should
-- this should be legal from the Soviet or Russian point of view.

Vice versa, if you are French and make an investment in Soviet Union or Russia as
it then became, you should be French and it should be -- your investment should be
allowed by France to be made abroad. That’s the idea.”***

Respondent’s description of the historical background of the Treaty is consistent and
provides a reasonable explanation for the requirement set forth in Article 1.2(a). Moreover,

the Tribunal observes that, during the Arbitration, Claimant did not dispute Respondent’s
narrative of the Treaty’s historical context.

However, even if Claimant had argued that the nationality requirement in Article 1.2(a)
exclusively applied to outward foreign investments made by Soviet investors — which is not
the case —, the Tribunal cannot disregard the bilateral nature of the Treaty and create a
distinction when the text of the Treaty itself does not make it. In accordance with Article 32
of the VCLT, recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the
circumstances of the Treaty’s conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from
the application of Article 31 of the VCLT, but not to impose a distinction that is not
envisaged in the text of the BIT.

Eight, the majority of the Tribunal observes that Claimant relies on a number of awards that
are inapposite to the present case.

Claimant asserts that, “as a matter of principle”, the critical dates for purposes of
determining Claimant’s standing to commence an arbitration are (i) the date of the violation
of the substantive provisions of the BIT; and (ii) the date of the proceedings.**? In support
of this assertion, Claimant relies on the following cases: Pac Rim v Salvador, Aguas del
Tunari v Bolivia, Vladislav Kim v Uzbekistan, Pey Casado v Chile and Serafin Garcia v
Venezuela. However, the majority of the Tribunal observes that even though it is correct
that a substantial number of awards have analysed the aforesaid dates as critical dates, none
of these decisions support the notion of a “principle” that contradicts, much less derogate,
the requirement set forth in the Treaty that an investor must be a national of one of the
Contracting Parties when making an investment in the territory of the other Contracting
Party. Moreover, none of the treaties analysed in the decisions put forward by Claimant
contain a language imposing a requirement similar to the one contained in the BIT.

For instance, the majority of the Tribunal observes that the issue of critical dates to
determine whether a natural person could be deemed to be a protected investor was not
discussed by the tribunal in Aguas del Tunari and Vladislav Kim.**° Likewise, in Pey
Casado, the question as to whether the relevant treaty required the investor to have the
relevant nationality at the moment of making the investment was not disputed and not
analysed by the tribunal.*°! In any event, the applicable Spain-Chile treaty in that case
contains a different wording to that of the Treaty, and does not require the investor to be
permitted by the law of the non-host State to make investments on the territory of the other
contracting party.‘°

435. Furthermore, the majority of the Tribunal disagrees that there is a principle in international
investment law according to which, regardless of the specific wording of each treaty, an
investor is not required to have the nationality of the non-host State when making the
investment. In fact, the awards in Pac Rim v El Salvador and Serafin Garcia v Venezuela
demonstrate that, contrary to Claimant’s assertions, this issue is not a matter of general
principle, but rather depends upon the specific wording of each treaty*”*.

436. Claimant also attempts to rely on the decision of the Serafin Garcia tribunal. However, as
set out above, the Serafin Garcia award has been partially set aside by the Paris Court of
Appeal because the arbitral tribunal did not consider the nationality of the alleged investor
at the date the investment was made.‘ For the majority of the Tribunal, it is apparent that,
contrary to Claimant’s assertions, the requirement that an investor holds the relevant
nationality at the time of his investment must be determined according to the specific
language of each treaty and cannot be excluded as a matter of principle.

437. Claimant also submits that the findings of Professor Oreamuno’s dissenting opinion should
be disregarded since they would “crystallize” the investor’s nationality at the date of his
own investment, regardless of subsequent nationality changes.‘°° The majority of the
Tribunal disagrees. The Tribunal’s interpretation of the Treaty would not render subsequent
nationality changes irrelevant; on the contrary, the Tribunal majority’s position is that
Claimant must have held French nationality on: (i) the date he made his investment; (ii) the
date of the alleged breach of the Treaty; and (iii) the date of the commencement of the
proceedings.

438. Whether Claimant was always required to have held French nationality between the
aforementioned dates is not a matter of dispute put forward by the Parties. Moreover, the
Tribunal was not asked to decide what the status of Claimant’s nationality would be if he
had held French nationality at the date of making the investment, lost it, and regained it
before the alleged breach of the BIT. The Tribunal is not called to decide upon the existence
of a continuous nationality rule under customary international law.

439. In fact, the evidence submitted by Claimant supports the Tribunal’s reasoning. As explained
by Respondent, M. Laazouzi concludes that “[t]he scope of the decision should then be
limited, in the sense that it crystalizes the nationality of an investor at the date of his own

, without consideration of future modifications.” The majority of the Tribunal
agrees with Respondent in the sense that the issue in this case is the nationality the investor
held on particular dates (and whether that qualifies him as an ‘Investor’ under the BIT), and
not whether the investment itself should be considered French or Russian.

 

Finally, Claimant claims that the Crimean cases, filed pursuant to the Ukraine-Russia BIT,
confirm his reasoning that treaties can extend protection conferred to investments if the
“nationality” of the investment changes.*°’ However, the Crimean cases do not appear, from
the publicly available information, to be comparable to the case at hand. For the majority of
the Tribunal, the matter in dispute in Crimea evolved from domestic disputes to
international ones by virtue of a territorial change and, more importantly, the issue in the
Crimean cases is not the nationality of the investor but the status of the investments.*

Based on the aforementioned, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the Treaty requires
Claimant to have held French nationality at the time he made his alleged investments. One
of the arbitrators issued a dissenting opinion precisely on this point.

b) Claimant did not hold French nationality at the date of his alleged investments

Claimant has initiated this Arbitration in connection with five groups of investments, i.e. (i)
the Red Square Project; (ii) the Shipyards; (iii) EPC; (iv) the Land Plots; and (v) other non-
Russian investments.

The Parties debated on the evidence in the record regarding the alleged investments of Mr.
Pugachev, including the date or dates in which the investments were made. Therefore, for
purposes of establishing the date in which these investments were made, the Tribunal
considered the evidence on the record, but, in addition, during the Hearing, the Tribunal
addressed specific questions to Claimant as to the aforementioned dates.

Claimant himself, in responding to the questions posed during the Hearing, indicated when
the respective investment was made, and, according to Claimant’s own assertions, he made
his alleged investments before he obtained French nationality on 30 November 2009. In the
following sub-sections, the Tribunal examines the temporal context of each investment.

1. Red Square Project

According to Claimant, he invested in the Red Square Project through an investment
agreement dated 9 August 2004 concluded between a Russian State enterprise (i.e.
Kremlevskiy) and LLC Middle Trading (also known as Stredniye Torgoviye Ryady or
STR). In his Statement of Claim, Mr. Pugachev explained that:

“On 9 August 2004, Kremlevskiy entered into an investment agreement (the “Red
Square_Ii Agreement”) with Mr. Pugachev’s ce y, LLC Middle
Trading Rows, also known as Stredniye Torgoviye Rvady (“STR”). STR had been
specifically created on 25 March 2004 for the purpose of the Red Square Project
and had for sole member IIB. On 29 December 2004, IIB transferred its shares to
Global Treasures Equity, which was indirectly owned by Mr. Pugachev. Global
Treasures Equity held 80,6 % of STR’s shares. TechnoAlliance, which was also
indirectly owned by Mr. Pugachev, held the remaining 19,4 % of STR.

 

446. During the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Mr. Pugachev was asked to provide an estimated date
for his investment in the Red Square Project. Mr. Pugachev confirmed that his investment
took place between 2004 and 2005:

“Q.: Well, we can open tab 11, the Statement of Claim, page 29, paragraph 36. But
one of the issues in this arbitration is timing of your both investment and then alleged
breach. And, therefore, from your point of view, when would you say your Red
Square investment project was made, as an investment?

A.: (Interpreted). We would have to turn up the investment contract. And obviously
they -- there is a detailed timeline and plan for the implementation of the
construction, the selection of contractors and so on and so forth, including the
general contractor. So when the management company was put in place, when the
director was appointed, the people were recruited, when the whole thing began,
when the ball was kicked in, that's when the investment began. And we're looking at
huge amounts of funds that were then invested directly into that particular project.

Q.: Can you please turn to tab 25, Claimant's witness Statement.

DR CREMADES: Excuse me. Could you give a date of those investments you are
talking about?

A. (Interpreted): Yes, it was translated. So are you looking to get the date when that
investment was made?

DR CREMADES: Correct.

A. (Interpreted): Of course I do not recall exactly. I think the contract says it all in
detail, but I don't have this contract in front of me. I don't have those documents
available to me. But obviously this is part of the case file. I just don't have that
document available to me as I sit here today. So I'm not in a position to give you a
date.

DR CREMADES: Well, I am not asking for a concrete date but more or less between
which years this investment took place.

A. (Interpreted): Well, if the contract was executed -- and I am sure you are ina
better position to recall that when did the investment contract deploy full legal force
and effect, I don't have it in -- available to me. Let's say in 2004, and I think it took
about six months, so it would have been between 2004 and 2005. That's when the
investment started. That's when we kicked the ball rolling on the investment.

DR CREMADES: Thank you.”>

In consequence, according to Claimant’s own contentions, his investment in the Red Square
Project occurred in 2004, i.e. more than five years before he allegedly acquired French
nationality in 2009.

During the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Claimant was asked to clarify the terms of his
investment in the Red Square Project. According to Claimant, his involvement in the Red
Square Project comprised, broadly, three different steps. First, Mr. Pugachev alleges that
President Putin asked him to provide $1.5 billion for a specific purpose. Second, President
Putin offered Mr. Pugachev a project in payment of that sum of money. Mr. Pugachev chose
the Red Square Project. Third, a tender process was opened for the Red Square Project,
Mr. Pugachev submitted a bid for $1.5 billion, and won the tender.

The aforementioned was accepted by Claimant during the Hearing on Jurisdiction:

“THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. I have a follow-up question on that same point. If
we go to your witness testimony and what you have declared today. I'm going to go
step by step. And please correct me if I'm saying something that is not. First you say
that you were asked by Mr President Putin to put $1.5 billion -- 1.5 billion for some
particular purpose that he needed for. Step one. Step two --

A. (Interpreted): May I just add, before we move on, he asked for 1.5 billion to be
provided to relocate, resettle the military personnel, to build flats for the military
personnel. Not just: give me 1.5 billion. That was to build apartments for the military
personnel. So that's the first link with the Red Square Project.

THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Step two, according to your testimony, he offered you to
ive you a project in payment of that. And you said that you chose the project, the
Red Square Project; and I told him that I was prepared to pay 1.5 billion and would

tender for the Red Square. That is correct?
A. (Interpreted): Yes.
THE PRESIDENT: And then the bid was opened, and you bid for 1.5 billion and you

won the bid. Is that an accurate statement?

A. (Interpreted): Correct.
THE PRESIDENT: Okay.”*'

In addition, Mr. Pugachev did not submit for this alleged investment, or for any other of the
alleged investments for which he claims protection, convincing evidence that the funds he
allegedly delivered to Mr. Putin — or any funds related to that transaction — had a French
origin or that a transfer of funds took place in order to make the investment.

In conclusion, Mr. Pugachev submits he made this investment at the time he was a Russian
national in the context of an alleged understanding with President Putin, for which there is

no evidence, concerning a domestic bid. Therefore, at the time of the alleged investment in
the Red Square Project, Mr. Pugachev was a Russian national who made an alleged
investment in Russia.

2. Shipyards

As regards the Shipyards, Claimant makes an unparticularised allegation that he acquired
an equity stake in the Northern Shipyard around the end of the 1990s, through a process that
would have taken, according to him, several years.*?

In his Notice of Arbitration, Mr. Pugachev claims that, in 1999, the managers of the
Northern Shipyard approached him seeking a loan for the expansion of the shipyard:

“In 1999, the managers of Northern Shipyard in St. Petersburg approached IIB
seeking a loan to finance the ion of a ling station for ships at Northern
Shipyard. In his capacity as then Chairman of IIB, Mr. Pugachev visited Northern
Shipyard. At the time, the shipyard was dilapidated and in a state of neglect. No new
ships had been built at Northern Shipyard in over 20 years, and the business had

been reduced to renting the premises to small businesses for use as a storage facility.

Mr. Pugachev, however, recognized its potential, and he devised a business plan to
redevelop Northern Shipyard. He proposed to invest in the shipyard and manage the
project in return for an equity stake in Northern Shipyard, and the then-managers of
Northern Shipyard agreed to this proposal. In this manner, Mr. Pugachev acquired
an equity stake in Northern Shipyard.”

Later, in his Statement of Claim, Claimant reiterated that he made his investments in the
Northern Shipyard at the end of the 1990s.**' Mr. Pugachev further alleges that he
purchased more than 75 % of the shares in the Northern Shipyard’s group companies and
that, over the ensuing years, he invested further and acquired additional stakes in the
Northern Shipyard. However, as shown below, Claimant did not provide a specific date for
these subsequent deals:

“Mr. Pugachev formally acquired an equity stake in the Northern Shipyard from
Mr. Boris Kuzyk, former advisor to President Boris Yeltsin. Mr. Kuzyk was a major
shareholder of the Northern Shipyard.

Eventually, Mr. Pugachev purchased more than 75% of the shares of the Northern
Shipyard’s group companies (apart from the Northern Shipyard itself the group

Northern Shipyard. At the time, the shipyard was dilapidated and in a state of neglect. No new ships had been built
in over 20 years, and the business had been reduced to vessels’ fuelling services and renting the premises to small
businesses for use as a storage facility. Mr. Pugachev, however, recognised its potential, and devised a business
plan to redevelop the Northern Shipyard. He then gradually acquired shares in the Northern Shipyard on the open
market. Other shareholders of the Northern Shipyards agreed to sell their stakes to Mr Pugachev. The process took
several years”).

A

included SE services, hinery pre other

related to the Shipyard).

Over the ensuing years, Mr. Pugachev invested further, and acquired additional
stakes in the Northern Shipyard. In parallel, Mr. Pugachev acquired stakes in
another shipyard located in St. Petersburg, known as the “Baltic Shipyard” and of
a construction bureau affiliated with the shipyards known as the “Iceberg Shipyard”.
The Baltic Shipyard was the sole competitor of the Northern Shipyard able to
construct the same class of vessels in the Russian Federation. It was important for
Mr. Pugacheyv to acquire shares in the Baltic Shipyard in order to concentrate in his
hands production of both navy and civil vessels. Mr. Pugachev acquired his shares

from the main shareholders of the Baltic Shipyard, namely Mr. Nesis, Mr.

Shulikovsky (then director of the Baltic Shipyard), Mr. Ilya Klebanov (then deputy
Prime Minister of Russia) and other individuals.”*

During the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Mr. Pugachev was asked to provide a temporal
reference regarding his alleged investment in the Shipyards. He explained that he began
purchasing shares in the 1990s and that he finished buying them around 2005 or 2007:

“Q.: Let's turn to your investments in shipyards then. There were three shipyards:
Baltic, Northern and Iceberg. Is that correct? And if you turn to your Statement of
Case at tab 11, page 52, paragraph 124, you say that by 2009 you held majority
interests in all three shipyards. Is that right?

A. (Interpreted): Yes. Absolutely.
Q.: Can we try to reconstruct when did you bought each of the shipyards?

A. (Interpreted): Okay. Let's begin by saying that the shares were publicly traded. It
was not privatisation. I was not buying it from a single individual or from the
Government. The shares -- some of the shares were even held by the workers, people
who were employed there -- and we're looking at 17,000 people of employees. So,
with respect to when I began purchasing shares, that was in the 1990s. When I
finished buying them? I would have said that that would have been maybe, I don't

 

know, around 2005 or 2007. Something like that. So it was a lengthy process; but by
the year 2009 -- it is just a statement of fact. By the year 2009 I did own those equity
stakes.”°06

 

Also, during the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Mr. Pugachev explicitly asserted that by
November 2009, he had bought all three of the shipyards:

“Q.: I appreciate you're trying to be helpful to the Tribunal, but can we still try to
get to my question. I'll reword it. Would it be, then, correct to say that by November

2009 you bought all three of the shipyards? Is that "yes" or "no"?

A. (Interpreted): Yes.”>""

Although Claimant’s allegations as regards the date of his alleged investment in the
Shipyards are surprisingly vague and poorly supported for an alleged significant investment,

505 Claimant’s Statement of Claim, 27 September 2017, {4 116-118.

it is clear that the alleged investment was made at the end of the 1990s or at the beginning
of the 2000s. In any event, as admitted by Claimant during the Hearing on Jurisdiction, by
November 2009 (i.e. the date on which he acquired French nationality) he had already
bought the Northern, Baltic and Iceberg Shipyards.

458. Again, there is no convincing evidence that the funds used to acquire the shares came from
a jurisdiction other than Russia, much less from France.

3. EPC

459. As to his purported investment in EPC, Claimant indicates that he acquired this company
in 2003 through one of his companies, LLC ForwardStyle. This is explained in the
Statement of Claim, as follows:

“Mr. Pugachev identified the potential of the Elegest plateau region as it is rich in
raw minerals but lacked the requisite level of investment in order to extract them.
Thus, Mr. Pugachev acquired EPC in July/September 2003, through his company
LLC ForwardStyle. By that time, EPC had already acquired the Licence, but was
not undertaking any exploration or mining operations yet, since it required massive
investments. Mr. Pugachev acquired 100 % of the shares in EPC from three
individuals namely, Mr. Yuri Shirmankin, Mr. Yevgeniy Chervyakov and Mr.
Vladimir Kumanyey [...)”>°*

460. Notwithstanding the above, the Tribunal finds it surprising that, during his cross-
examination in the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Mr. Pugachev claimed not to recall how he
made his investment in EPC:

“MR GOLDBERG: Can we turn to EPC, please. That is tab 11. Statement of Case -
- of Claim, page 125 at paragraph 409. Just to remind you, that what it says is that
you invested through LLC ForwardStyle; is that right? Do you remember this
company? Did you invest through this company?

A. (Interpreted): I do not recall exactly, to be honest with you. To be honest, I do not
recall.

Q.: But was that investment made in July or September 2003?

A. (Interpreted): I'm not sure I understand which investment you're referring to.
What kind of investment and where, please?

Q.: I will just make sure that EPC is translated correctly.
A. (Interpreted). Yes. Yes, I understand.

Q. So what I'm trying to get is for you to confirm that investment was made through
ForwardStyle LLC in July or September 2003.

508 Claimant’s Statement of Claim, 27 September 2017, 1 409 (emphasis added).

Award on Jurisdiction
18 June 2020
Page 102 of 112

A. (Interpreted): Sitting here today, I'm not sure I can recall that, I don't remember
the name, to begin with. We had hundreds of ies, both resident and non-

resident companies.”°”

461. The Tribunal further notes that Respondent made a number of document requests during
the document production phase of this Arbitration, by which it asked Claimant to
demonstrate the time at which he made his alleged investments. To demonstrate the date of
the alleged investment in EPC, Claimant produced an extract from the Russian Unified State
Register of Legal Entities in respect of LLC ForwardStyle. However, this document (i) was
obtained in 2018; (ii) lists Mr. Viktor Petlenko as its sole shareholder; (iii) makes no
reference to Claimant; and (iv) does not demonstrate a connection to LLC ForwardStyle or

the date of Mr. Pugachev’s investment in EPC.*'°

462. Accordingly, from the evidence on the record and in accordance with Claimant’s own
assertions, the Tribunal must conclude that, in the best of cases, Claimant’s investments in

EPC were made through ForwardStyle LLC, in July or September 2003.

4. Land Plots

463. Claimant submits that he acquired a plot of land in the Krasnogorsk District of the Moscow
Region on 24 August 2010, through ZAO Optik Trade (“Optik Trade”). The plot was later
divided into 167 plots (the “Land Plots”), and it is the alleged expropriation of the Land

Plots of which Claimant complains.

464. In his Statement of Claim, Claimant described the ownership’s chain of the land that

eventually constituted the Land Plots as follows:

“The Plot originally belonged to a larger plot of land owned by the farming
collective Leninskii Luch (“LL Collective”). Ownership of the Plot then changed
hands on several occasions prior to Optik Trade’s acquisition. All these changes of
ownership were duly registered in the Moscow Region Register of Companies and
the State Land Registry.

 

In 2003, the LL Collective, by decision of its General Assembly dated 5 February
2003, decided to contribute two land plots located in the Moscow Region,
Krasnogorsk District, East of Dmitrovskoye and Gribanovo villages (“Land Plot No.
45” and “Land Plot No. 41”) (one of which included the Plot) to the charter capital
of ZAO Dmitrovskii Sovkhoz (“DS”), a company created jointly with OOO
“ForwardStyle”, OOO “Oleandr” and OOO “Universal”, in exchange for shares.

On 21 April 2003, during the General Meeting of the founding members of DS, which
was attended by LL Collective, the charter capital of DS, the founding members’
contribution (notably the contribution by LL Collective of the Plot) and the shares’
distribution were unanimously approved. In application of these decisions, on 6 June
2003, DS and LL Collective entered into a transfer and acceptance statement for
Land Plot No. 45 and Land Plot No. 41.487.

466.

467.

In compliance with these decisions and agreements, on 19 December 2003, DS
registered its ownership rights over these land plots at the Land Registry.

In February 2004, DS divided Land Plot n° 45 into three new plots of land (“Land
Plot No. 47”, “Land Plot No. 48”, “Land Plot No. 49”), and then merged Land
Plots n°48 and n°49 into one single plot (“Land Plot No. 72”).

In March 2004, DS decided to contribute Land Plot No. 72 to the charter capital of
Niva, in exchange for shares. Niva then transformed this land plot into Land Plot
No. 77 and Land Plot No. 78 (the Plot).

On 16 August 2010, Niva contributed the Plot to the charter capital of Plescheevo,
one of Mr. Pugachev’s companies, in exchange for shares. Plescheevo later sold the
Plot to Optik Trade.

After it acquired the Plot, Optik Trade applied for and received governmental
approval to subdivide the Plot into 167 individual plots to be used for the
construction of residences (“167 Land Plots”). Optik Trade is the registered owner

of all 167 Land Plots.”>''

Based on the above, the Tribunal considers that the chain of ownership of the Land Plots

can be summarized in four distinct moments:

d.

from 2003 to 2004, the Land Plots were owned by Dmitrovskiy Sovkhoz (“DS”);

from March 2004 to August 2010, the Land Plots were owned by Niva CJSC
(originally LLC) (“Niva’’);

during August 2010, the Land Plots were purchased by Plescheevo CJSC
(“Plescheevo”); and

on 24 August 2010, the Land Plots were sold by Plescheevo to Optik Trade.

Of great importance to this case is that Claimant describes Niva as “[a]n entity indirectly
owned by Mr Pugachev which had acquired Land Plot no. 72 from DS”>'? He also defines
Plescheevo as “one of Mr Pugachev’s companies”>'> This means that, since Niva acquired
the Land Plots in 2004, they were, either directly or indirectly, an asset of Mr. Pugachev.

During the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Mr. Pugachev was extensively cross-examined in
relation to the acquisition of the Land Plots.*!* The Tribunal notes that Mr. Pugachev did
not remember the date or the form in which he made his investment in the Land Plots.

However, at the end of his cross-examination on this subject, Mr. Pugachev affirmed that
by March 2004, all the property was already acquired by Niva:

“THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me. Mr Pugachev, I have two questions here, just to see

if we can move on. Is Niva a company -- was Niva a company owned by you? "Yes"
or "no"?

A. (Interpreted): Yes.

THE PRESIDENT: It was. Okay. Now, you're saying in -- and I'm referring to the
Statement of Claim, paragraph 502 that we have here -- that on August 16, 2010,
Niva contributed a plot to the capital of Plescheevo. Is that correct? It's another
company of yours?

A. (Interpreted): Yes, it does. Absolutely.

THE PRESIDENT: Okay. So for the purposes of the dates of the acquisition, all the
acquisition of the lands, of the plots, took place, in any event, before August 16, 2010?
Is that a fair statement? Because if on August 16, 2010, Niva contributed a plot to
the charter of another company that means by at least August 16, 2010, everything
was consolidated; is that correct?

A. : Yes. Sure, sure, sure.

THE PRESIDENT: Okay.

A.: Yes.

THE PRESIDENT: Then, in paragraph 501, it says that in March 2004 there was a
contribution of land plot 72 to the charter capital of Niva in exchange for shares. So

in March 2004 all the property was already acquired, is that correct or not?

 

A. (Interpreted): I think so. I do not know the exact date, but if it says so in the

Statement of Claim then it is so.

THE PRESIDENT: Let's move on, please.”>"°

 

In other words, during the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Mr. Pugachev acknowledged that (i)
both Niva and Plescheevo were companies owned by him; and (ii) that in March 2004, all
of the property was already acquired by Niva.

The Tribunal further observes that Respondent requested Claimant to prove the timing of
his investment in the Land Plots, including his interests or involvement with DS. During the
document production phase of this Arbitration, Claimant only produced documents dating
back to 2018 in relation to ZAO Optik Trade and Plescheevo, which do not mention
Claimant, and no documents at all in relation to Niva and DS.*!°

In light of the above, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant acquired the land which was
subsequently divided into the Land Plots no later than March 2004.

5. Non-Russian investments

Regarding Claimant’s “other substantial investments” in non-Russian companies (i.e. OPK
Biotech LLC, Hédiard Group, Péridot SA and Luxury Investment SA) the Tribunal notes
that these were also made before Mr. Pugachev acquired French nationality.

First, Claimant contends that he established OPK Biotech LLC on 7 July 2009. In his
Statement of Claim, Claimant asserts that:

“OPK Biotech LLC was incorporated in the State of Delaware on 7 July 2009.
Claimant ultimately owns and controls OPK Biotech LLC, as well as a series of
entities related to OPK Biotech LLC, including OPK Biotech Holdings Company.
OPK Biotech LLC acquired its assets on 9 September 2009 from Biopure
Corporation during Biopure’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy case.”>""

Second, Claimant claims that he acquired Hédiard Group in 2007. On this point, he explains
that:

“Tllustrating his strong links and commitments to France, Mr. Pugachev purchased
the worldwide famous épicerie Hediard from Michel Pastor in 2007.”>"8

Third, Claimant asserts that he acquired Péridot SA in September 2009. In the Statement of
Claim, it is established that:

“Peridot SA was a Swiss luxury watches manufacturer’s assets with notably the
trademarks BLU and Sinocron, machinery, tools, models and lease of premises. It
was acquired by Mr. Pugachev in September 2009 from BLU SA for CHF 1,2 million.
Mr. Pugachev also acquired Peridot’s building and completely renovated such
premises including the production facilities. Mr Pugachev owned Peridot via his
companies Luxury Investments SA and Poljot SA.”>!

Finally, Claimant submits that Luxury Investment SA was established in 2006. Claimant
claims that:

“Luxury Investments SA (Luxembourg), established in 2006, was a holding company
for Claimant's non-Russian assets such as Hediard, Poljot-Peridot or Luxe TV."

 

The Tribunal concludes that, pursuant to Claimant’s own assertions, all of his non-Russian
investments were made before he acquired French nationality, i.e. 30 November 2009. The
Tribunal will not analyse whether these investments fall within the scope of the Treaty
considering that they were made in third countries.

For the reasons set out above, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the alleged
investments made by Claimant were investments made before Claimant obtained his French
nationality. Considering that (i) the Treaty requires Claimant to have held French nationality

517 Claimant’s Statement of Claim, 27 September 2017, 4 537 (emphasis added).

at the time he made his alleged investments; and (ii) that Claimant did not hold French
nationality at the date of all of his alleged investments, in the operative part of this Award
on Jurisdiction, the majority of the Tribunal will declare that it does not have ratione
personae jurisdiction because Mr. Pugachev is not an “investor” in accordance with the
Treaty. In consequence, the Tribunal will dispose all of Claimant’s claims.

Respondent’s allegations regarding Claimant’s dominant and effective nationality,
abuse of process, attribution and the fulfilment of mandatory preconditions under the
Treaty do not affect the Tribunal’s findings on jurisdiction

In addition to the Parties’ various submissions examined at Sections IV (A) to (D) supra,
the Russian Federation has further argued that:

a. Claimant’s dominant and effective nationality is Russian;
b. Claimant’s claims are abusive;

c. Claimant has not fulfilled the mandatory preconditions under Article 7 of the Treaty;
and

d. The DIA’s actions are not attributable to Respondent.

The Tribunal observes that none of the above-mentioned claims could affect the decision
made by the majority of the Tribunal set out at Section IV (D), i.e. that the Tribunal does
not have ratione personae jurisdiction because Mr. Pugachev is not an “investor” in
accordance with the Treaty. For this reason, the Tribunal will not examine the additional
claims put forward by Claimant.

COSTS OF THE ARBITRATION

Claimant requests the Tribunal to issue an Award ordering Respondent to bear the burden
of the overall costs incurred by Claimant in order to defend against Respondent’s Memorial
on Jurisdiction.! In his Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant further requests the Tribunal to order
Respondent to bear the burden of all costs incurred by Claimant so far in this Arbitration.°”?

Respondent, in turn, requests the Tribunal to issue an Award ordering Claimant to pay the
costs of this Arbitration and all expenses that Respondent has incurred in defending its
position, including, but not limited to, fees and expenses of the Tribunal, legal counsel,
experts, and consultants.°?

For the reasons explained below, the Tribunal finds that Claimant shall assume the entirety
of the Arbitration Costs, his own Legal Costs, and 40% of Respondent’s Counsel Fees.

a) The UNCITRAL Rules provide that costs follow the event

The Tribunal notes that neither the Treaty nor the Terms of Appointment or the Procedural
Orders issued in this Arbitration provide for a specific rule on allocation of costs.

Paragraph 7.9 of POI provides that “[...] [t]he Tribunal will decide upon the appropriate
allocation of such costs in its final award”. Paragraph 12.5 of the Terms of Appointment
provides that, in accordance with Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, “any payment made
from the deposit shall be without prejudice to a final allocation of costs by the Tribunal in
an award”.

According to Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, “[t]he arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs
of arbitration in its award.” In turn, Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that:

J. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be
borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each
of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable,
taking into account the circumstances of the case.

 

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in
article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the
circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such
costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that
apportionment is reasonable.

3. When the arbitral tribunal issues an order for the termination of the arbitral
proceedings or makes an award on agreed terms, it shall fix the costs of arbitration
referred to in article 38 and article 39, paragraph 1, in the text of that order or
award. [...]

The aforementioned set of rules grant the Tribunal some discretion to decide on the costs of
the Arbitration.

Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules draws a distinction between costs of legal
representation and assistance (“Legal Costs”) and the rest of the costs incurred in
connection with the arbitration (“Arbitration Costs”).

With respect to the Arbitration Costs, the UNCITRAL Rules provide for the general rule
that the “loser pays”, i.e. costs follow the event, but allows the Tribunal to apportion the
costs between the Parties if the Tribunal considers that the apportionment is reasonable
considering the “circumstances of the case”.

As regards Legal Costs, the UNCITRAL Rules grant the Tribunal a general discretion,
considering the “circumstances of the case”, to make either Party responsible for said costs
or to apportion the costs between the Parties according to what it considers to be
“reasonable.”

and EUR 600,000

 

On the other hand, the Arbitration Costs amount to EUR 1,001,748.55.

Claimant and Respondent have, as of the date of this Award, placed the amount of EUR
600,000 each on deposit with the SCC in respect of Arbitration Costs, for a total of EUR
1,200.000.

The fees per hour for the members of the Tribunal was established at paragraph 12.1 of the
Terms of Appointment. In turn, paragraph 12.3 of the Terms of Appointment provides that
the members of the Tribunal shall be reimbursed for all charges reasonably incurred in
connection with the Arbitration.

The Tribunals’ total fees and expenses, as of the date of this Award on Jurisdiction, amount
to EUR 988,939.55. The SCC has charged the amount of EUR 12,809 for its fund-holding
services in connection with the Arbitration.

The SCC will send to the Arbitral Tribunal and the Parties an updated statement of account
after the issuance of this Award on Jurisdiction.

Accordingly, the Tribunal will now apportion the Arbitration Costs and Legal Costs
between the Parties in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules.

c) Claimant must assume the entirety of the Arbitration Costs

The Tribunal has no reason to depart from the “costs follow the event” rule with respect to
the Arbitration Costs in this specific case.

During the jurisdictional phase of the Arbitration, the Parties submitted their positions in
multiple rounds of written memorials — including Post-Hearing Briefs — and, in November
2019, the Parties and the Tribunal held the Hearing on Jurisdiction.

In this Award on Jurisdiction, Claimant succeeded in its defences to the jurisdictional
objections filed by Respondent regarding whether Claimant is a French national under
international law and whether that dual nationals are excluded from the Treaty.

However, Respondent succeeded in its jurisdictional defence that the Treaty requires
Claimant to have held French nationality at the time he made his alleged investments and
therefore, that the Tribunal does not have ratione personae jurisdiction because Mr.
Pugachev is not an “investor” in accordance with the terms of the Treaty. This means that
Respondent was fully successful in challenging the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and, for this
reason, the Tribunal dismissed Claimant’s claims in their entirety.

In addition, and as explained further in the following section, the costs of the arbitration
were impacted by multiple applications filed by Claimant on a variety of matters, which in
most of the cases were rejected by the Tribunal.

The Tribunal, therefore, concludes that Claimant must assume the entirety of the Arbitration
Costs. This decision will be recorded in the operative part of this Award on Jurisdiction.

d) Claimant must assume his own Legal Costs and 40% of Respondent’s Counsel
Fees

Concerning the Legal Costs, the Tribunal will exercise its general discretion by reference
to the circumstances of the case and according to what it considers to be reasonable.

As a departing point, the Tribunal must consider the fact that Respondent prevailed since
the Tribunal dismissed the entirety of Claimant’s claims. However, the Tribunal
acknowledges that this Arbitration involved complex factual and legal matters, including
complex legal debates rooted upon Russian law and public international law resulting from
the very particular text of the Treaty.

In addition, an important portion of the Legal Costs, including costs of experts, were related
to the jurisdictional defences in which Respondent did not succeed, particularly the defences
on whether Claimant was a French national under French law and international law.

Both Parties conducted the proceedings in a professional manner. The Tribunal did not
observe lack of professional courtesy, unsubstantiated fraud allegations, delaying tactics, or
willingness to slow down the proceedings. Furthermore, during the stage of document
production, both Parties displayed a professional conduct and assisted the Tribunal in the
efficient conduction of the Arbitration.

The Tribunal must also consider the fact Claimant submitted multiple applications
concerning a wide variety of matters. There were at least four applications for provisional
or interim measures — including orders to courts elsewhere to suspend proceedings or take
particular measures — that were filed by Claimant and that were rejected by the Tribunal.
Furthermore, out of the several measures requested by Claimant, the only provisional
measure granted in the Interim Award was the suspension of the France Extradition Request
initiated by the Russian Federation. Most of the other requests made by Claimant were
rejected for lack of merit.

The Tribunal further acknowledges the fact that the Parties debated whether Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections should be decided in a separate proceeding. Claimant argued, inter

alia, that none of Respondent’s grounds for seeking a bifurcation of the proceedings were
jurisdictional in nature, and that, in any event, the bifurcation will not serve the efficiency
of the present proceedings. Claimant did not succeed in its position and the Tribunal ordered
the bifurcation of the Arbitration in the terms set out in PO3. The bifurcation of the
proceedings allowed Respondent to conduct in an efficient manner its case and provide the
Tribunal with the opportunity to focus exclusively on the jurisdictional objections raised in
the Arbitration.

Based on the above-mentioned considerations, the Tribunal finds that Claimant must
assume his own Legal Costs plus 40 % of Respondent’s Counsel Fees. This decision will
be recorded in the operative part of this Award on Jurisdiction.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal by majority hereby:
a. Declares that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant’s claims;
b. Dismisses Claimant’s claims in their entirety;
c. Dismisses all other claims raised by the Parties during the Arbitration;

d. Lifts the order to take all actions necessary to suspend the France Extradition
Request, as defined in the Interim Award;

e. Orders Claimant to assume the entirety of the Arbitration Costs as provided in
Section V(c) of this Award on Jurisdiction; and

f. Orders Claimant to assume his own Legal Costs, 40 % of Respondent’s Counsel
Fees as provided in Section V(d) of this Award on Jurisdiction.
