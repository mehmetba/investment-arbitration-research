Case 1:18-cv-01148 Document 1 Filed 05/16/18 Page 2 of 14

Sweden, pursuant to the 2010 Arbitration Rules of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm
Chamber of Commerce (the “SCC”).!
The Parties

1. Petitioner Novenergia is a Société d'investissement en capital a risque (SICAR),
incorporated in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, with legal address at 28, Boulevard Royal,
L-2449, Luxembourg. Novenergia operates throughout Europe, with its principal place of business
in Luxembourg.

2. Respondent Spain is a foreign state within the meaning of Section 1603(a) of the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (“FSIA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1602 et seq.

Jurisdiction and Venue

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to Section
203 of the FAA, which provides that actions or proceedings falling under the New York
Convention arise under the laws and treaties of the United States and are subject to the original
jurisdiction of the district courts of the United States. 9 U.S.C. § 203. This proceeding arises
under the New York Convention because it is an action to recognize and enforce in the United
States an arbitral award made in Sweden, a state-party to the Convention.

4. Pursuant to the United States’ ratification of the Convention on September 30,
1970, and its implementing legislation under Chapter 2 of the FAA, the United States will enforce
arbitral awards made in the territory of another contracting state, where such award applies to
disputes arising out of legal differences, whether contractual or not, that are considered

commercial. See 9 U.S.C. § 202 (“An arbitration agreement or arbitral award arising out of a legal

' A true and correct copy of the Final Award, as transmitted by the Tribunal, is submitted as Exhibit
1 to the Declaration of Fernando Mantilla-Serrano, executed on May 16, 2018, and served and
filed simultaneously with this Petition (the “Mantilla-Serrano Declaration”).

relationship, whether contractual or not, which is considered as commercial, including a
transaction, contract, or agreement described in section 2 of this title, falls under the Convention”);
see also Status — Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards,
http://www.newyorkconvention.org/countries.

5. The Final Award was rendered in Sweden, which ratified the Convention without
reservations on January 28, 1972.? Id.; see also Final Award at 200 (‘Seat of the Arbitration:
Stockholm, Sweden”). As detailed below, the Final Award arises out of Spain’s breach of its
obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty, Dec. 17, 1994 (the “ECT”), 2080 U.N.T.S. 100, an
international agreement which imposes on contracting states certain obligations in relation to
commercial energy activities.» ECT at Art. 10; 9 U.S.C. § 202. Both Spain and Luxembourg are
parties to the ECT, thus entitling Novenergia, a national of Luxembourg, to bring claims under the
ECT against Spain. See Constituency of the Energy Charter Conference,
https://energycharter.org/who-we-are/members-observers/; 9 U.S.C. § 202. Moreover, the
Arbitration giving rise to the Final Award, administered by the SCC, was conducted pursuant to
Spain’s agreement to submit to binding arbitration under the ECT. 9 U.S.C. §§ 2, 202; see also
ECT at Art. 26(5)(a)(ii) (providing that consent to arbitrate under the ECT satisfies the requirement
for a written arbitration agreement enforceable under the New York Convention). The Final
Award was rendered against a foreign state, Spain, in favor of a Luxembourg investor, Novenergia,

and is not between citizens of the United States. Cf 9 U.S.C. § 202.

2 Spain is also a party to the New York Convention, having ratified the Convention without
reservations on May 12, 1977. See also Status — Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement
of Foreign Arbitral Awards, http://www.newyorkconvention.org/countries.

6. This Court also has subject matter jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to
Section 1330(a) of the FSIA, which vests United States district courts with original jurisdiction
over any nonjury civil action against a foreign state with respect to which the foreign state is not
entitled to immunity under the FSIA or under any applicable international agreement. 28 U.S.C.
§ 1330(a). Spain is not entitled to immunity because a foreign state does not enjoy sovereign
immunity from a proceeding:

in which the action is brought, either to enforce an agreement made

by the foreign state with or for the benefit ofa private party to submit

to arbitration all or any differences which have arisen or which may

arise between the parties with respect to a defined legal relationship,

whether contractual or not, concerning a subject matter capable of

settlement by arbitration under the laws of the United States, or to

confirm an award made pursuant to such an agreement to

arbitrate, if .. . (B) the agreement or award is or may be governed

by a treaty or other international agreement in force for the United

States calling for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral

awards .. . or (D) paragraph (1) of this subsection is otherwise

applicable.
28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6) (emphasis added). Here, as described in more detail below, the Final
Award was rendered in an arbitration arising under the ECT, a treaty that entitled Novenergia to
submit to arbitration all disputes concerning Spain’s treatment of certain commercial investments
made by Novenergia. ECT at Art. 26. Moreover, the Final Award is governed by the New York
Convention, an international agreement in force in the United States calling for recognition and
enforcement of the Final Award. Spain is further not entitled to immunity because it waived such
immunity by affirmatively consenting to the arbitration of the parties’ underlying dispute. See 28
U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1), (6).

7. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Spain pursuant to the FSIA. Under

Section 1330(b) of the FSIA, United States district courts have personal jurisdiction over a foreign

state as to every claim for relief over which they have original jurisdiction under Section 1330(a)

Case 1:18-cv-01148 Document 1 Filed 05/16/18 Page 5 of 14

of the FSIA where service has been made under Section 1608 of the FSIA.* 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330(a),
(b); 28 U.S.C. § 1608.

8. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 204 and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f)(4),
which provide that a civil action against a foreign state may be brought in the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia. This Petition is timely because it is filed within three years
after the Final Award was made. 9 U.S.C. § 207.

Background
The Parties’ Dispute

9. The parties’ dispute arose out of Spain’s breach of its obligations under Article 10
of the ECT, which required Spain to provide fair and equitable treatment to investors, including
Novenergia. Final Award at § 399; ECT at Art. 10(1).

10. On September 13, 2007, Novenergia, an investor in renewable energy facilities,
invested in eight solar energy, or photovoltaic, plants in Spain. Final Award at ff 2, 165-166, 539.
Novenergia’s investment was based on Spain’s assurances of guaranteed tariffs to renewable
energy producers, which were aimed at incentivizing companies to invest heavily in the Spanish
electricity sector. Id. at 9551.

11. Once it secured those investments, Spain changed course. Contrary to its prior

assurances and investors’ reasonable expectations, over the course of several years, Spain enacted

4 Specifically, 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b) provides that “Personal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall
exist as to every claim for relief over which the district courts have jurisdiction under subsection
(a) where service has been made under section 1608 of this title”; 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a) in turn
provides that the district courts shall have original jurisdiction over a foreign state “as to any claim
for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity under
either sections 1605-1607 of this title or under any applicable international agreement.”

laws and regulations which eradicated the tariffs that had induced Novenergia to invest in the first
place, thus causing it significant damages. Final Award at ff] 189, 665-666, 667-668, 681.

regime following Novenergia’s investment were “radical and unexpected,” and “had a significant

This Court Should Confirm the Final Award

30. Under Section 207 of the FAA, a court “shall confirm” an award covered by the
New York Convention “unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or
enforcement of the award specified in the [New York] Convention.” 9 U.S.C. § 207. None of the
New York Convention grounds for denying recognition and enforcement of an award applies in
this case, and so the Final Award should be confirmed. See Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela, 146 F. Supp. 3d 112, 120 (D.D.C. 2015) (“[T]he FAA affords the district
court little discretion in refusing or deferring enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.”) (citation

omitted).°

° A party resisting confirmation “bears the heavy burden” of establishing that one of the
enumerated grounds for denying confirmation in Article V of the New York Convention applies.
Rusoro Mining Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, No. 16-CV-02020 (RJL), 2018 WL
1143153, at *4 (D.D.C. Mar. 2, 2018) (quoting Gold Reserve Inc, 146 F. Supp. 3d at 120 (D.D.C.
2015).
