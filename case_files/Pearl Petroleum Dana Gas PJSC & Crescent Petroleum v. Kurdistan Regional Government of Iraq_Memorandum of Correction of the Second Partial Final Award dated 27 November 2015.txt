Case 1:17-cv-00894-APM Document 1-3 Filed 05/12/17 Page 6 of 7

1, On 27 November 2015 the Tribunal issued a Second Partial Final Award (“the
Award”). It contains in paragraph 105(a) the following order:

We order that KRG pay to Pearl within 28 days the sum of
US$1,981,951,322 in respect of Pearl’s claims under
contracts for the sale of condensates and LPG made
pursuant to BP [bullet point] [7] of the HoA [Heads of
Agreement] until 30 June 2015, being USD$1,762,505,521
in respect of sales and deliveries to the KRG and
US$219,445,801 in respect of sales to third parties.”

2. Paragraph 90 contains the same figures.

a The figure of US$1,981,951,322 was inserted in error because the Tribunal
accidentally did not deduct the sum of US$18,581,002 representing net
receivables which had been received from third parties and for which the
Claimants accepted the KRG was entitled to credit. The need for this deduction
appears from the Claimants’ expert evidence and submission and was noted by
the Tribunal in paragraph 85 of the Award, where it is stated that “the net
amount shown to be owing to Pearl is US$1,963,370,320”.

4. Article 27.1 of the LCIA Arbitration Rules provides:
Article 27 Correction of Awards and Additional Awards

27.1 Within 30 days of receipt of any award, or such lesser
period as may be agreed in writing by the parties, a party may
by written notice to the Registrar (copied to all other parties)
request the Arbitral Tribunal to correct in the award any
errors in computation, clerical or typographical errors or any
errors of a similar nature. if the Arbitral Tribunal considers the
request to be justified, it shall make the corrections within 30 days
of receipt of the request. Any correction shall take the form of
separate memorandum dated and signed by the Arbitral Tribunal
or (if three arbitrators) those of its members assenting to it; and
such memorandum shall become part of the award for all
purposes.

5, The Claimants requested the correction by notice to the Registrar (copied to
the Tribunal and all other parties on 24 December 2015. The correction was
opposed by the KRG (in whose favour it would be) by letter dated 5 January

2016 on the ground that the error was not computational, clerical or

typographical. There was further correspondence from the Claimants on 12
January 2016 and the KRG on 13 January 2016.

6. The Tribunal considers that the omission of the US$18,581,002 deduction was
an error in computation within the meaning of Article 27.1. The Tribunal
failed to make a deduction in the calculation of what was owing when, on the
Claimants’ evidence which it had accepted, such a deduction should have been

made,

7. The Tribunal therefore orders that in paragraphs 90 and 105(a) of the Award,
the figure US$1,963,370,320 shall be substituted for the figure
US$1,981,951,322 and that this Memorandum shall become for all purposes
part of the Award.
