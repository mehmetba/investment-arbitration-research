2517, 330 U.N.T.S. 38 (the “New York Convention”) and Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration
Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 201 ef seq.. to confirm a duly-rendered arbitration award (the
“Award”) issued in their favor against Respondent the Italian Republic (“Italy”).

2. Petitioner CEF Energia B. V. is a company duly established under the laws of the
Kingdom of the Netherlands (the “Netherlands”) and is registered with the Netherlands Chamber
of Commerce Commercial Register under the RSIN 821442430.

3. Respondent is a foreign state within the meaning of the Foreign Sovereign

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a) and
personal jurisdiction over Italy pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b).

5: Specifically, 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6) provides that a foreign state is not immune
with respect to any claim against it that seeks recognition of an arbitration award made pursuant
to an agreement to arbitrate if the “agreement or award may be governed by a trealy or other
international agreement in force for the United States calling for the recognition and enforcement
of arbitral awards[.]” 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6)(B). This Court therefore has subject matter

The Arbitration Agreement

A. Italy’s Agreement to Arbitrate

7 Italy agreed to arbitrate its dispute with Petitioner through its accession to the
Energy Charter Treaty (“ECT”)? The arbitration agreement between Petitioner and Italy
consists of two elements: (i) Italy’s consent contained in Article 26(3) of the ECT; and (ii)
Petitioner's consent contained in their Request for Arbitration.

8. Italy signed the ECT on December 17, 1994 and ratified it on December 5, 1997.
The ECT entered into force in Italy on April 16, 1998. In accordance with Article 1(2) of the
ECT, Italy was a Contracting Party to the ECT until! December 31, 2014 when it withdrew from
the ECT.3 While Italy is no longer a member of the ECT (as of January |, 2016), all investments
existing at the time of its renunciation of the ECT remain protected, and investors from Italy are
allowed to use the Dispute Settlement Provisions of the ECT until 2036.4 Therefore, in
accordance with Article 1(2) of the ECT, Italy is a Contracting Party to the ECT.°

9. Article 26 of the ECT, entitled “Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and a
Contracting Party,” provides as follows in sub-paragraph (3)(a):

(3)(a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its

unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or

conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

10. Subparagraphs (b) and (c) do not apply to this dispute. Accordingly, Italy
provided its written consent to the arbitration in ECT Article 26(3), as it is a Contracting Party to

the ECT.

2 A true and correct copy of the ECT is attached as Exhibit B to the Sun Aff.

3 Italy's withdrawal took effect on January 1, 2016.

+ Exhibit B, Article 47(3) of the ECT provides for a “sunset period” of 20 years during which the ECT will continue
to apply to pre-existing qualifying investments after a signatory state’s withdrawal from the Treaty.

3 Exhibit B, Article 1(2) of the ECT provides that a “Contracting Party” means “a state or Regional Economic
Integration Organization which has consented to be bound by this Treaty and for which the Treaty is in force.”

claims against Italy were properly submitted to arbitration in accordance with the ECT, and the
tribunal properly found that it had jurisdiction over Petitioner’s claims.

14. Articles 26(2)(c) and 26(4)(c) of the ECT provide that an Investor may elect to

The Arbitration

16. Petitioner commenced the arbitration at issue herein by serving a Request for
Arbitration on Italy on November 20, 2015. The Request for Arbitration invoked Article
26(4)(c) of the ECT. which permits the submission of disputes arising under the ECT to
arbitration “under the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.”

17. The arbitration was seated in Stockholm, Sweden and proceeded in accordance
with the SCC Rules. as provided by the ECT. The selection of the arbitral tribunal consisted of
Professor Dr. Klaus Sachs (appointed by Petitioner), Prof. Giorgio Sacerdoti (appointed by
Respondent). and Mr. Klaus Reichert, S.C. (Chairperson, appointed by Messrs. Sachs and
Sacerdoti).

18. Italy was represented by counsel in the arbitration by its attorneys (the
Avvocatura Generale dello Stato). Italy participated in all aspects of the arbitration: Italy
submitted an Answer, a Statement of Defense, and Rejoinder as well as witness statements and
expert reports.

19. The tribunal conducted a hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits from February 19-22,
2018 at the ICC’s hearing facility in Paris, France, during which the tribunal heard testimony
from both Petitioner's and Respondent’s witnesses.

20. The tribunal issued the Award on January 16, 2019. The Award found that Italy
had violated its obligations under the ECT with respect to Petitioner’s investments and found
Italy liable to Petitioner in the amount of €9.600,000.00, plus pre- and post-award interest at a
rate of LIBOR plus 2% compounded annually from January 1, 2015 until full and final
satisfaction of the Award. The tribunal further ordered Italy to pay Petitioner €1,000,000.00 for

the reasonable costs incurred by Petitioner. This Petition seeks recognition of the Award by this

Court. A true and correct certified copy of the Award is attached as Exhibit A to the Sun
Affirmation.
Summary of the Dispute

21. Petitioner’s case arises out of certain legislative and regulatory measures
introduced by Italy since the early 1980s which were aimed at promoting and encouraging the
development and use of renewable energy sources.’ Specifically, after the European Parliament
and the European Council enacted Directive 2001/77/EC promoting electricity produced from
renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market, Italy began enacting incentive
schemes for photovoltaic (“PV”) plants known as Conto Energia Decrees."

22. Between January 2010 and March 2012, CEF invested in three large PV projects:
In January 2010, Petitioner acquired Sunholding S.r.1., which owned Megasol S.r.]., a company
holding the rights to a 13MW PV plant known as Megasol;!?_ in December 2010, Petitioner
acquired a 70% controlling stake in Phenix S.r.]. (“Phenix”) a company which held all project
rights to a 24 MW PV plant known as the Sugarella plant;'> and in March 2012, Petitioner
acquired Enersol S.r.I., a company which held all project rights to a multi-section PV plant of
approximately 48 MW known as the Enersol plant.!4

23. Each of these plants was granted a specific incentive tariff based on the Conto
Energia decree in force at the time the plant began operating. As a result, Megasol was
governed by Conto IJ; Phenix and Section | of Enersol by Conto II; and the remaining 6

sections of Enersol by Conto /¥. Each plant receiving incentives under the Conto Energia

framework also received a confirmation letter known as a “Tariff Recognition Letter” from the
Gestore dei Servizi Energetici GSE S.p.A. (“GSE”), the state-owned company responsible for
paying the incentive tariffs to electricity producers under the Conto Energia decrees, confirming
the plant’s right to a specific tariff. Additionally, the operator of the plant would also enter into a
contract with the GSE known as a “GSE Agreement.” The GSE Agreements would set for the
specific tariff incentive rate that the PV plant would be paid. '

24. — Shortly after Petitioner’s investments, Italy began enacting a number of decrees
and administrative fees that reduced the value of the incentive tariffs, and which later served as
the basis for Petitioner's arbitration claims, including:

© In July 2012, Italy enacted Conto V, which provided that as of January |, 2013, all
PV producers benefiting from incentive tariffs under any Confo were now
required to pay an annual administrative fee of €0.0005 per kWh of incentivized
energy.!6

e In June 2014 and August 2014, Italy enacted Law Decrees 91/2014 and 116/2014
respectively. Article 26 of Law Decree 91/2014, known as Spalmaincentivi (or
“incentive spreading”) modified the existing incentive scheme provided by the
Conto Energia decrees such that the incentive tariff would be spread over 24
years instead of the original 20.'7 PV producers were offered a choice between
three options: (i) the original Spalmaincentivi, (ii) a tariff reduction from 2015-
2019, with a promise of increased tariffs in the remaining years; or (iii) a 6-8%
cut over 20 years.!8

© In October 2014, Italy issued Resolution No. 522/2014/R/EEL, which imposed
“imbalance costs” on renewable energy producers. As a result, producers have
had to pay these costs since January 1, 2015.!9

© In August 2011, Italy began expanding its so-called “Robin Hood” tax, which was
designed to increase the tax on profits of oil, gas and other traditional energy
companies, to include all energy producers — including renewable energy
producers. Thus, all energy producers with a gross annual income over €10

million and taxable income of over €1 million were now taxed at a rate of 34%-
38% for the fiscal years 2011-2013,

e In June 2013, Italy expanded yct again the Robin Hood tax by reducing income
thresholders to a gross annual income of €3 million and taxable income over
€300,000.

* In December 2013. Italy classified PV plants as immovable property. These
plants thereby became subject to increased IMU and TASI charges. While ftaly
ultimately reduced these charges by about 90% in 2016. the charges paid in 2014
and 2015 have yet to be refunded.??

25. The net effect of these new regulations drastically reduced the profitability and
value of Petitioner's investments.

26. Petitioner's Request for Arbitration alleged that Italy. through its adoption of

these measures, violated Article 10{1) of the ECT by failing to provide fair and equitable

 

(“FET”) to Clai vi that notwith ding Italy's 1, legislati
and regulatory obligations with regard to CEF and its investments, Italy failed to observe those
obligations and thereby violated the “umbrella clause” of Article 10(1) of the ECT by violating
its obligations to Petitioner under the Conto Energia decrees.?) CEF also alleged that Italy failed
to provide a P legal fr k and bly impaired CEF’s i

27. Italy presented two objections to the tribunal's jurisdiction: (i) that the dispute
was an Intra-EU dispute and that European Union (“EU”) law forbids EU Member States from

arbitrating disputes with investors from other EU Member States?? and (ii) that the Robin Hood

Tax, qualification of assets for fiscal and cadastral purposes, imbalance charges and

administrative fees all are legitimate taxation measures, subject to the carve-out in ECT Article
21(1).73

28. — The tribunal rejected the first jurisdictional objection. The tribunal recalled that it
is called “to resolve the alleged breach by Respondent of Art. 10(1) ECT on the basis of
principles of public international law relevant to the interpretation and application in the present
case of the ECT, a multilateral treaty in force between The Netherlands and [Italy]."24 The
tribunal then went on to reject Italy’s and the Commission’s position that “clause [Article 26,
ECT], if interpreted as applying intra-EU is incompatible with EU primary law and thus
inapplicable.”

29. The tribunal sustained the second objection and therefore dismissed Petitioner's
claims arising out of Italy’s various taxation measures.*6 The tribunal also rejected CEF’s
argument that Article 26 of Law Decree 91/2014 or Spalmaincentivi breached the umbrella
clause of Article 10(1) because this Law Decree was not per se illegal under Italian law.27

30. However, the tribunal did conclude that by imposing the Spalmaincentivi, Italy
violated CEF’s legitimate expectations. The tribunal found that, unlike the Megasol and Phenix
plants which “still had a number of steps to take before [CEF] knew for certain that the hoped-
for incentives [would] actually awarded,” the Enersol plant “enjoyed crystallised rights” to the
20-year incentive.*® The tribunal found that CEF had a legitimate expectation based on the
Contos, Tariff Recognition Letters. and GSE Agreement. and Enersol’s connection to the

national grid, that the tariff cut Enersol received from Italy would remain constant and last the
