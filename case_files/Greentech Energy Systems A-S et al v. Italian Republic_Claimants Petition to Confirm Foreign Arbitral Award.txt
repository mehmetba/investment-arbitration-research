and costs as provided therein and as authorized by law, plus the costs of this proceeding; and (iii)
awarding Petitioners such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
Parties, Jurisdiction and Venue

1. Petitioners bring this summary proceeding under the United Nations Convention
for the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the “New York Convention”),
21 U.S.T. 2517, 330 U.N.T.S. 38, and Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9
U.S.C. §§ 201 et seg., to confirm a duly-rendered arbitration award issued in their favor against
Italy.

2. Petitioner Greentech Energy Systems A/S (“Greentech’”), now known as Athena
Investments A/S, is a company incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Denmark, with its
corporate address at Frederiksborggade 15, 3rd Floor, DK -1360 Copenhagen K, Denmark.
Greentech became Athena Investments A/S on December 12, 2017.

3. Petitioner NovEnergia General Partner S.A. is the liquidator of NovEnergia II
Energy & Environment (SCA) SICAR (“NEE”), which is a company incorporated under the
laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, with its corporate address at 28 Boulevard Royal, L-
2449 Luxembourg. NovEnergia General Partner S.A. was appointed by NEE’s shareholders to
oversee its dissolution and liquidation.”

4. Petitioner NovEnergia II Italian Portfolio SA (“NIP”) is a company incorporated
under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, with its corporate address at 28 Boulevard
Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg. NEE owns a 97.6% interest in NIP, and 100% of the voting shares

in NIP.

2 A copy of the notarial deed recording the resolution of the general shareholders of NEE is attached as Exhibit B to

5. Respondent is the Italian Republic and is a foreign state within the meaning of the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (“FSIA”), 28 U.S.C. §§1330, 1332, 1391(f), 1441(d), 1602-
11.

6. This court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a), and
personal jurisdiction over Italy pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b).

7. Specifically, 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a) provides an exception to sovereign immunity
for any claim against a foreign state that seeks recognition of an arbitration award made pursuant
to an agreement to arbitrate if the agreement or award “may be governed by a treaty or other
international agreement in force for the United States calling for the recognition and enforcement
of the arbitral awards[.]” 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6)(B). This Court therefore has subject matter
jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a), because Italy is not entitled to
sovereign immunity in connection with this proceeding, which seeks recognition and
enforcement of a foreign arbitral award falling under the New York Convention.

8. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to CPLR 503(a), and the amount in
controversy herein exceeds the jurisdictional limitations of all courts of inferior jurisdiction.

The Arbitration Agreement
A. Italy’s Agreement to Arbitrate

9. Italy agreed to arbitrate its dispute with Petitioners pursuant to the Energy Charter
Treaty (“ECT”).3 The arbitration agreement between the Petitioners and Italy consists of two
elements: (i) Italy’s consent contained in Article 26(3) of the ECT; and (ii) Petitioners’ consent

contained in their Request for Arbitration.

3 A true and correct copy of the ECT is attached as Exhibit C to the Molina Aff.

10. Italy signed the ECT on December 17, 1994 and ratified it on December 5, 1997.
The ECT entered into force in the Italian Republic on April 16, 1998. In accordance with Article
1(2) of the ECT, Italy was a Contracting Party to the ECT at the time the arbitration underlying
the Award was commenced. Italy gave notice of its withdrawal from the ECT on December 31,
2014 and its withdrawal became effective on January 1, 2016.4 Pursuant to Article 47(3) of the
ECT, the post-withdrawal period during which the ECT continues to apply to pre-existing
qualifying investments like Petitioners,’ is twenty years.5 In other words, all investments
existing at the time of Italy’s renunciation of the ECT remain protected, and investors in Italy are
allowed to use the Dispute Settlement Provisions of the ECT against Italy until 2036.° Italy’s
withdrawal from the ECT is of no consequence to this case.
11. Article 26 of the ECT, titled “Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and a
Contracting Party,” provides as follows in sub-paragraph 3(a):
(3)(a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting
Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a
dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance
with the provisions of this Article.
12. Subparagraphs (b) and (c) do not apply to this dispute. Accordingly, Italy
provided its written consent to the arbitration in ECT Article 26(3), as it was a Contracting Party
to the ECT at the time the arbitration was commenced, and the ECT’s post-withdrawal period

lasts until 2036.

26(4)(c) of the ECT.'°

The Arbitration

19. Petitioners commenced the arbitration at issue herein by serving a Request for
Arbitration on Italy on July 7, 2015. The Request for Arbitration invoked Article 26(4)(c) of the
ECT, which permits the submission of disputes arising under the ECT to an arbitral proceeding
under the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.

20. The arbitration was seated in Stockholm, Sweden and proceeded in accordance
with the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (“SCC”) Rules, as provided by the ECT. The
Tribunal consisted of David R. Haigh, Q.C., appointed by Petitioners, Professor Giorgio
Sacerdoti, appointed by Respondent, and Professor William W. Park, appointed by the two co-
arbitrators. !!

21. Italy was represented in the arbitration by a competent team of lawyers from the
Italian Republic’s State General Attorney’s Office (the Avvocatura Generale dello Stato), and by
Professor Maria Chiara Malaguti, External Counsel to the Legal Services of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs.!2 Italy participated in all aspects of the arbitration: it submitted an Answer to
Petitioners’ Request for Arbitration, which included a Request for Bifurcation; a Statement of
Defense on the Merits; a Reply on Bifurcation; and a Rejoinder on the Merits. Italy submitted

witness statements and expert reports along with its various pleadings.

22. The Tribunal conducted a hearing on Jurisdiction, the Merits, and Quantum, from
June 26 - 30, 2017 at the ICC’s hearing facility in Paris, France, during which the Tribunal heard
testimony from Petitioners’ and Respondent’s witnesses.

23. The Tribunal issued the Award on December 22, 2018. In the Award, the
Tribunal found Italy had violated its obligations under the ECT with respect to Petitioners’
investments, and found Italy liable to Petitioners in the amount of € 11.9 million plus interest at
the rate of LIBOR plus 2%, compounded annually. The Tribunal also awarded Petitioners the
costs of the arbitration, totaling € 478,000, and half their legal and related expenses, in the
amount of € 1,408,268.!3 This Petition seeks recognition of the Award by this Court. A true and
correct certified copy of the Award is attached as Exhibit A to the Molina Affirmation.

Summary of the Dispute

24. Petitioners’ case arises out of certain legislative measures introduced by Italy
starting in 2005, the purpose of which was to induce private investment in renewable energy
facilities in order to enable Italy to meet national and EU level targets for electricity generation
from renewable energy sources by 2010.'4 Under these legislative measures, called Conto
Energia (Energy Account), investors in Italy’s renewable energy sector received incentive
payments for each unit of electricity generated and fed into the system.'5 These incentive
payments were in addition to the wholesale prices the electricity generating companies received
for the sale of their electricity.!° Each Conto Energia provided that the incentive payment, once

granted, would continue for twenty years, starting on the date on which the benefitted plant

began operation.!7 As a first step, each operator of a renewable energy facility receiving the
Conto Energia incentives received a letter expressly stating the term of the incentive.!8
Thereafter, the operator would enter into a contract with Italy’s electric utility, Gestore dei
Servizi Energetici (“GSE”), setting forth the incentive rates the investor was entitled to, and the
specific dates comprising the twenty year term of the incentives. !9

25. In addition to the Conto Energia incentive premiums, Italy also established a
regime whereby it would purchase electricity directly from smaller energy producers at
minimum guaranteed prices.2° These prices were intended to prevail irrespective of what the
wholesale electricity market did.?!

26. Encouraged by Italy’s favorable regime for renewable energy investments,
Petitioners started developing photovoltaic projects in Italy starting in 2008.22

27. Between 2010 and 2013, NIP and NEE invested in fifty-two photovoltaic projects
in Italy, fifty of which were structured as an equity holding in a joint venture company called
Holding Fotovoltaica S.p.A (“HFV”).23 NIP purchased 49.75% of HFV’s shares, while
Novenergia Italia S.p.A., a subsidiary of NEE, purchased .25% of HFV’s shares.”4 Thereafter,

two independent joint venture partners purchased the remaining 50% of HFV’s shares.25_ In

addition to the fifty photovoltaic projects held by HFV, NIP and NEE invested directly in two
other photovoltaic projects.26 NIP and NEE’s investments amounted to € 175 million.27

28. Greentech also invested substantial sums in the Italian renewable energy sector.
Through its merger in 2011 with GWM Renewable Energy I S.A., Greentech acquired the entire
share capital of GWM Renewable S.p.A.—Renewable Energy I S.A.’s wholly owned
subsidiary—which held a portfolio of seventy-five photovoltaic projects in Italy.28 Through its
investment of more than € 131 million in the merger and subsequent acquisitions, Greentech held
a 100% ownership stake in eighty-two photovoltaic projects in Italy as of January 2015.

29. Starting in late 2013, Italy began enacting a number of measures to reduce the
electricity cost burden on consumers attributable to its incentive programs,” including among
others:

° On December 23, 2013, Italy enacted Law Decree No. 145/2013. This law
provided photovoltaic energy producers two options: (i) to continue
receiving incentives for the original twenty-year period, but to stop
receiving incentives thereafter; or (ii) to accept reductions to their incentive
payments, but for the term to be extended by seven years.*°

e On June 24, 2014, Italy enacted Law Decree No. 91/2014, known as the
Spalma-Incentivi, whereby incentives previously granted to photovoltaic
plants over 200 kW were modified starting January 2015.3! Under Article

26(3) of the Spalma-Incentivi, producers were given a choice between three

different methods for Italy to calculate the incentives applicable to their
photovoltaic investments—each method resulted in a reduction in the
incentives due to each project.*2_ In addition to changing the incentives
applicable to photovoltaic projects, the Spalma-Incentivi changed the way in
which incentive tariffs were disbursed.33_ Under Article 26(2) of the
Spalma-Incentivi, disbursements would be paid on a monthly basis based on
90% of a plant’s estimated average yearly electricity production.*4 Lastly,
under Article 10(4) of the Spalma-Incentivi, administrative fees applicable
to each photovoltaic project were calculated based on a plant’s capacity,
which varied from the way they were calculated previously, which was by
effective output of energy.*5

. Also, in December of 2013, Italy altered the minimum guaranteed price
scheme applicable to photovoltaic investments by reducing the cap on
eligible electricity from 2 million kWh per year to 1.5 million kWh per
year.*© Moreover, the size cutoff for plants eligible to receive minimum
guaranteed incentive tariffs was reduced to 100 kWh.37

° In March 2015, Italy announced it would seek reimbursement of certain
incentives granted to photovoltaic plants since 2005 by offsetting them

against incentive tariffs payable in the future.38

. To offset the costs to the system of providing photovoltaic energy producers
with incentive tariffs, Italy decided photovoltaic energy producers should
pay an administrative fee to the government based on their plants’
capacities.*9 Additionally, Italy compelled photovoltaic energy producers to
pay imbalance costs to compensate Italy for their failure to make accurate
projections of the amounts of photovoltaic energy would be fed into the
grid.40

30. The net effect of these measures drastically reduced the profitability of
Petitioners’ investments.

31. In their Request for Arbitration, Petitioners alleged that Italy’s treatment of their
investments was inconsistent with the standards set forth Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT.*! Italy
presented multiple objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction: (i) that the ECT does not cover
intra-EU disputes; (ii) that certain measures attacked by Petitioners were exempted under Article
21 of the ECT; (iii) that the ECT’s unconditional consent requirements set forth in Article 26
were not satisfied; (iv) that no amicable solution had been attempted; and, (v) that the Tribunal
did not have jurisdiction over any claims arising under the ECT’s umbrella clause because the
GSE contracts contained exclusive jurisdiction clauses.*?

32. The Tribunal rejected all of Italy’s jurisdictional objections, with the except for
those based on Article 21 of the ECT, finding that the measures challenged by Petitioners
amounted to taxation measures for purposes of the ECT. On liability, a majority of the Tribunal
found that the incentive tariff reductions under the Spalma-Incentivi “undermined Claimants’

legitimate expectations, failed to treat Claimants’ investments transparently and consistently, and
thus violated the FET Clause.”43 Additionally, the Tribunal found that “the incentive tariff
reduction portion of the [Spalma-Incentivi] violated the impairment clause and breached the
obligations set forth in the last sentence of [the umbrella clause].”44

33. The Tribunal awarded Petitioners compensation for the damages caused to their
investments by Italy’s breaches in the following amounts: € 7.4 million to Greentech, and € 4.5
million to NEE and NIP. Additionally, the Tribunal (i) awarded Petitioners interest on their
damages at the annual LIBOR rate plus 2% per annum, compounded annually; (ii) ordered Italy
to reimburse Petitioners for their contribution to the costs of the arbitration, amounting to €
478,000; and (iii) ordered Italy to reimburse Petitioners for one half of their legal and related
expenses, amounting to € 1,408,268.45
