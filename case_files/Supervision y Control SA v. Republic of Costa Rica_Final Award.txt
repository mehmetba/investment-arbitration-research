The Arbitral Tribunal will refer jointly to Claimant and Respondent as the “Parties”.

II. ARBITRAL AGREEMENT

The Request for Arbitration of SyC is based on Article XI of the Bilateral Investment
Treaty between the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Costa Rica (hereinafter, the
“BIT” or the “Treaty”), which provides:

“Article XI. Disputes between a Party and investors of the other Party.

1. Notice of any investment-related dispute arising between one of the Parties and
an investor of the other Party with respect to matters governed by this Treaty shall
be given in writing, including detailed information, by the investor to the Party
receiving the investment. To the extent possible, the parties to the dispute shall try

to settle such disputes by an amicable agreement.

2. If the dispute cannot be settled in such manner within a period of six months
after the date of the written notice referred to in Paragraph 1, the investor may

submit the dispute:

a) to the competent courts of the Party in whose territory the investment was made;
b) to an international arbitral tribunal from among those cited below:

i) the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), created
by the ‘Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of Other States’, opened for signature on March 18, 1965, when each

State party to this Treaty adhered to such;...”

Regarding the selection of forum, Article XI.3 of the BIT provides the following:

11

10.

11.

“3. Once an investor has submitted the dispute to an arbitral tribunal, the award
shall be final. If the investor has submitted the dispute to a competent court
of the Party in whose territory the investment was made, it may, in addition,
resort to the arbitral tribunals referred to in this article, if such national
court has not issued a judgment. In the latter case, the investor shall adopt
any measures that are required for the purpose of permanently desisting

from the court case then underway.”

[Emphasis added]

Claimant expressly consented to the arbitration by filing its Request for Arbitration on

December 21, 2011 (hereinafter, the “Request for Arbitration’).

Ii. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On June 10, 2011, Claimant notified the government of Costa Rica in writing of the
existence of an investment dispute, as provided for in Article XI.1 of the BIT. In this
communication, Claimant argued that Costa Rica’s actions had violated articles III, IV

and V of the BIT.

On December 21, 2011, Claimant submitted a Request for Arbitration to the ICSID
Secretariat, in accordance with article 36 of the ICSID Convention. This request was

registered on February 9, 2012 as ICSID Case No. ARB/12/4.

On June 21, 2012 the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted, composed of Mr. Joseph P.
Klock Jr., appointed by Claimant, Dr. Eduardo Silva Romero, appointed by
Respondent, and Dr. Claus von Wobeser, appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID

Administrative Council as president of the Arbitral Tribunal.

On July 17, 2012, in terms of article 13(1) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for Arbitration
Proceedings (hereinafter, the “Arbitration Rules”), the Arbitral Tribunal held its first

12

12.

13.

session with the Parties by conference call. The session was recorded in a transcript,
discussing among other matters the agreement of the Parties on the rules applicable to
the arbitration and a provisional procedural calendar. It was also recorded that the
Parties agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted and that they had no

objections with respect to the appointment of its members.

On September 19, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, containing
the Arbitral Tribunal’s determinations and the Parties’ agreements reached during the
conference call of July 17, 2012, related to the procedural rules that would govern the

arbitration.

On September 30, 2012, Claimant requested an extension for the filing of its Claim
Memorial.? On October 11, 2012 the Arbitral Tribunal decided to grant the requested
extension, modifying sections 13.1 and 14.1 of the Procedural Order No. 1. After
considering the communications sent by Claimant on September 30, 2012, and October
1, 2012, and by Respondent on October 1 and 2, 2012, on October 11, 2012, the Tribunal
made further modifications to section 13.1 of the procedural calendar. The procedural

calendar reflected the following:

“13. 1 The schedule shall be as follows:

13.1.1 The Claimant shall file a Memorial by November 7, 2012;

13.1.2 The Respondent shall file a Counter-Memorial by February 28, 2013;

13.1.3 The Claimant shall file a Reply by May, 9, 2013; and

13.1.4 The Respondent shall file a Rejoinder by July 18, 2013.”

“14.1 The schedule for document production shall be as follows:

2 Emails from the Claimant to the Arbitral Tribunal dated September 30 and October 1, 2012.

13

14.

15.

14.1.1 A request for document production by any disputing party shall be filed on
or before November 14, 2012.

14.1.2 Objections to the request for production of specific documents or category
of documents shall be filed on or before November 21, 2012.

14.1.3 The reply to objections to the production of specific documents or category
of documents shall be filed on or before November 28, 2012.

14.1.4 The production of documents in respect of which there are no objections

shall be on or before December 5, 2012.

14.1.5 The decision of the Tribunal (either upholding the objections or ordering the
production of the requested documents) shall be on or about December 12, 2012.

14.1.6 The requested documents shall be produced two week from the date of the

Tribunal’s decision. The Tribunal will specify this date in the respective order.”

On November 7, 2012, Claimant submitted its claim memorial (hereinafter, the
“Memorial” or “Claimant’s Memorial”), along with the factual exhibits C-1 to C-63,
witness statements from Amador de Castro, José Luis Lopez, Fernando Mayorga,
Eduardo Sancho Gonzalez, Stephan Brunner, Francisco Jiménez and Rodolfo Méndez
Mata, and the expert reports from Nicholas Good with exhibits, Rubén Hernandez,
Leonel Fonseca Cubillo, Luis Diego Vargas Chinchilla and Laura Cristina Rivera. On

February 18, 2013 the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 on document production.

On March 1, 2013, Respondent submitted its counter-memorial (hereinafter, “Counter
Memorial”), along with the factual exhibits R-1 to R-113, legal exhibits RL-1 to RL-100,

Mesén, Allan Roberto Ugalde, and the expert reports from Timothy H. Hart, Manuel

Enrique Jiménez Meza and Aldo Milano Sanchez with exhibits.

On March 5, 2013, Respondent submitted exhibit R-114 of its Counter Memorial.

On March 14, 2013, Claimant sent a letter to the Tribunal complaining that Respondent
raised jurisdictional objections outside the time frame provided in Procedural Order
No.1. Also, Claimant requested the Arbitral Tribunal to confirm that jurisdictional
issues would be addressed simultaneously with the merits of the case when rendering
the final award, pointed out an alleged infringement of Procedural Order No. 2 by
Respondent and requested the modification of the procedural calendar in order to

submit its Reply on June 30, 2013.

On March 16, 2013, Respondent submitted its reply to Claimant's letter dated March 14,
2013, requesting the Arbitral Tribunal to deny the 53 (fifty-three) day extension
requested by Claimant and addressing the allegations concerning failure to comply
with Procedural Order No. 2, among other things. On March 19, 2013, Claimant sent a

further communication.

On April 24, 2013 the Arbitral Tribunal by majority issued Procedural Order No. 3,
granting Claimant a 25 (twenty-five) day extension for the submission of its Reply,
therefore the procedural calendar contained in Section 13.1 of the Procedural Order No.
1 was modified as follows:

“13. 1 The schedule shall be as follows:

13.1.1 The Claimant shall file a Memorial by November 7, 2012;

13.1.2 The Respondent shall file a Counter-Memorial by February 28, 2013;

15

20.

21.

23.

24.

13.1.4 The Respondent shall file a Rejoinder by August 12, 2013.”

On April 26, 2013, Respondent requested the Arbitral Tribunal, considering the
extension granted to Claimant for the submission of its Reply in the Procedural Order
No. 3, to grant Respondent the same additional time for the submission of its Rejoinder.

The Arbitral Tribunal granted the requested extension.

On May 23, 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal suggested to the Parties to hold a hearing on
jurisdiction and merits (hereinafter, “Hearing”) in the week starting on January 13,

2014. The Parties confirmed their availability by emails dated May 28, 2013.

On June 3, 2013, Claimant submitted its Reply (hereinafter, “Reply”), along with
exhibits C-064 to C-116, the complementary witness statements of Laura Rivera,
Fernando Mayorga, Victor Manuel Gonzalez, and José Luis Lopez Rodriguez with
exhibits, as well as the complementary expert reports from Rubén Hernandez Valle,
Leonel Fonseca with exhibits, José Manuel Calderén, Ernst & Young, Nicholas Good

with exhibits and Carlos Andrés Arguedas.

On August 6, 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal confirmed that the Hearing would be held
from Monday, January 13, 2014 to Friday, January 17, 2014, and informed the Parties

that a telephone conference prior to the Hearing would be held.

On September 6, 2013, Respondent submitted its Rejoinder (hereinafter, “Rejoinder”),

After the Hearing, the Parties submitted the exhibits introduced during or after the
Hearing. Claimant presented the exhibits C-117 to C-132, and Respondent presented
exhibits R-126 to R-132.

On March 28, 2014, the Parties submitted their Post-Hearing briefs.

On June 2, 2015, Claimant wrote to Ms. Luisa Fernanda Torres Arias requesting the
intervention of the Secretary General of ICSID, alleging that the Arbitral Tribunal had
lost its impartiality because Ms. Ann Catherine Kettlewell, the prior Secretary of the
Tribunal, had joined the firm Arnold & Porter, which represents Respondent in this

arbitration.

On July 20, 2015, Claimant submitted a proposal to disqualify the Arbitral Tribunal
under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention (the “Disqualification Proposal”).

On August 31, 2015, Mr. Jim Yong Kim, Chairman of the ICSID Administrative
Council,5 informed the Parties of his intention to seek an external recommendation.
concerning Claimant's Disqualification Proposal, following established ICSID practice
of seeking an external recommendation when a proposal to disqualify involves a former
staff member of the World Bank. Through letters dated September 21, October 13,
October 15, and November 20, 2015, Mr. Jim Yong Kim appointed Mr. William K. Slate

II to issue a recommendation on the Disqualification Proposal.

After receiving the correspondence related to the Disqualification Proposal, and a series
of additional communications and submissions from the Parties and from the members

of the Arbitral Tribunal, Mr. Slate issued his recommendation on February 17, 2016.

On March 7, 2016, Mr. Jim Yong Kim issued his final decision on Claimant's
Disqualification Proposal after considering each Parties’ arguments and the arbitrators’

explanations. Mr. Kim concluded that the Disqualification Proposal “does not meet the

5 Pursuant Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, it falls upon the
Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council to decide the Proposal.

21

standard set forth in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention for the disqualification of an

arbitrator,” and accordingly, rejected the Disqualification Proposal.

On July 22, 2016, the Arbitral Tribunal closed the proceedings in accordance with Rule
38(1) of the Arbitration Rules. On the same date, and under instruction of the Arbitral

Tribunal, Mr. Gonzalo Flores notified the closing of the proceedings to the Parties.

On August 11, 17 and 18, 2016 the Parties presented their submissions on costs. On
August 17, 2016, Claimant made a submission requesting the Tribunal to reopen the
proceedings to admit new documents into the record under Rule 38 of the Arbitration

Rules.

After receiving submissions from the Parties, on November 17, 2016, the majority of the

Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, deciding as follows:

“1. After carefully analyzing the new evidence submitted by Claimant, the
Tribunal by majority has decided not to reopen the proceedings and to dismiss such
new evidence, because it does not meet the requirements set forth in Rule 38 of the

ICSID Rules.

2. Rule 38 provides that the Tribunal may reopen the proceedings exceptionally
when ‘new evidence is forthcoming of such nature as to constitute a decisive factor’
or when ‘there is a vital need for clarification on certain specific points.’ In short,
the majority of the Tribunal finds that (i) said evidence does not constitute a
decisive factor on this case, and (ii) it has no need for clarification on any points.

The detailed reasons for this decision will be included in the final Award.

3. The Tribunal has unanimously decided to extend the period to issue the award

by a further 60 days, as allowed under Rule 46 of the ICSID Rules.”

DETAILED REASONS ON THE MAJoRITY’S DECISION TO DISMISS CLAIMANT'S

NEW EVIDENCE

As provided in Procedural Order No. 5, this section will discuss the reasons of the

Majority’s decision to dismiss Claimant's new evidence.

In order to determine whether the new evidence submitted by Claimant met the criteria

set forth in Rule 38(2) to reopen the proceedings, the Tribunal carefully reviewed the

new evidence that reflects the following facts:

d

On September 4, 2014, the Executive Director of COSEVI certified, upon
Riteve’s prior request, that he was not aware of any sanctions to Riteve as a

result of a breach to the Agreement.®

On November 17, 2014, Riteve submitted a request for the readjustment of
rates before the PSRA. On November 24, 2014, the PSRA rejected the request
claiming that it lacked the rate adjustment methodology set forth in clause

9.4 of the Contract.”

On November 10, 2015, the Executive Director of COSEVI certified, upon
Riteve’s prior request, that he was not aware of any breach to the terms of the

Agreement by Riteve.8

On November 13, 2015, Riteve submitted before the PSRA a request for the
readjustment of rates. On November 19, 2015, PSRA rejected the request
claiming that it lacked the rate adjustment methodology set forth in clause

9.4 of the Contract.?

e) On June 1, 2016, the MPWT sent a letter to Riteve requesting Riteve’s
collaboration in certain initiatives that intended to promote a healthy
environment and to reduce traffic accidents in Costa Rica. In exchange for the
disbursements that said collaboration would require from Riteve, and
acknowledging the need to establish a rate adjustment methodology for the
VTI service, the Rules for the Procedure to Readjust the Rates of the VTI
service would be published as of July 16, 2016.1°

f) On June 2, 2016, Riteve replied to the MPWT’s June 1* letter, explaining how
Riteve could contribute to the aforementioned initiatives. Riteve emphasized
that its collaboration was subject to the publication and establishment of the
rate adjustment methodology for the VTI service for the duration of the

Contract. 1

On June 27, 2016, the Vice Minister of MPWT issued a statement in the

cd

Official Gazette informing the general public that a draft of the decree called
“Rules of Procedure for the Rate Readjustment of the Technical Vehicular
Revision Service assigned to Riteve SyC S.A” had been drafted. The
statement contained a web link where the draft of the decree could be
consulted, allowing any interested parties to submit any comments on the

project to the MPWT.!2

=

On July 11, 2016, the PSRA issued its comments on the draft of the decree
mentioned above. PSRA noted that clause 9.4 of the Contract was still in force,
and said clause provides that the MPWT would issue the methodology to
adjust the VTI rates. However, said methodology had not yet been published

in the Gazette."

Regarding the first requirement set forth in Rule 38(2), the new evidence presented by
Claimant does not constitute a “decisive factor” in the present case, because said evidence
relates to the merits of the case, and the Tribunal will not analyze the merits of the case
for the reasons stated in this award. Indeed, the new documents submitted by Claimant
relate to the adjustment of rates for the VTI service and the methodology for carrying it
out, but they do not, in any way, change the fact that Claimant's claims had already
been submitted to local courts and do not have any influence on the decision that this
Tribunal has adopted to resolve this case. Even assuming that the new evidence put
forward by Claimant fully demonstrated the facts that Claimant is making reference
to—and the arguments it is putting forward—said demonstration would not be

relevant to the outcome of the case.

Regarding the second requirement, and for the same reason stated in the above
paragraph, the Tribunal finds that the new evidence submitted by Claimant does not
respond to a “vital need for clarification on certain points.” The facts of this case are clear,
the Tribunal fully understands them, and the evidence offered by Claimant does not

change the Tribunal’s understanding of the relevant facts to resolve this case.

Lastly, and in addition to the reasons above—which by themselves are sufficient to
deny the admission of the new evidence—it is important to note that all the new
documents submitted by Claimant on August 17, 2016, pre-date the closing of the
proceedings on July 22, 2016. The PSRA Resolution No. 154-RIT-2014 dates of 24
November 2014; the PSRA Resolution No. 148-RIT-2015 dates of 19 November 2015; the
Certificate issued by the Executive Director of the Road Safety Council (Consejo de
Seguridad Vial) dates of 10 November 2015; the Certificate issued by the Executive
Director of the Road Safety Council (Consejo de Seguridad Vial) dates of 4 September
2014; the Communication No. DVTSV-2016-0358 of the MPWT dates of 1 June 2016; the
Letter from Riteve SyC to the MPWT, dates of 2 June 2016; the Official Gazette No. 123,
dates of 27 June 2016; and the PSRA Communication No. 487-RG-2016, dates of 11 July
2016. Thus, the Tribunal considers that Claimant had sufficient time to submit the new

evidence before the proceedings were closed, but failed to do so.

Vv. SUMMARY OF THE FACTS

At the end of the 1990s, Costa Rica opened its economy and implemented a
privatization policy, promoting international investment in various sectors of its
economy, with the intention of reducing the growing external debt. For these reasons,
Costa Rica started several international public tender procedures in order to award

certain concession contracts.!4

Before 1998 Costa Rica did not require any technical inspection for vehicles (hereinafter,
“VTI"). The control of polluting emissions was carried out in private workshops and
the service of review of security elements was done directly by the Ministry of Public
Works and Transportation (hereinafter, “MPWT”) in a single station located in the city
of San José, which serviced all the vehicles of the country with certain shortcomings in

relation to the facilities, technology, personnel and training.’

In August of 1996, during the Administration of President José Maria Figueres, Costa
Rica began a program for the control of polluting emissions called “Ecomarchamo”, in
an attempt to reduce air pollution due to vehicle emissions. Under the program, every
vehicle had to go through an emission inspection once a year, and twice a year in the
case of taxis and buses. The inspection would be conducted by privately owned
workshops, which would be properly trained and authorized by the MPWT, pursuant
to article 20 of the Transit Law No. 7331 and the Executive Order 23025.16

On January 29, 1998, through the National Procurement Office of the Ministry of
Finance (hereinafter, the “Procurement Office”) and the MPWT, Costa Rica issued an
invitation to the International Public Tender Proceeding Number 002-98 for the creation
and functioning of stations for the integrated vehicle technical inspection, published in

the Official Federal Gazette number 20 on January 29, 1998 (hereinafter, the “Tender”).

The purpose of the Tender was to award the concession for the provision of integrated
VTI services to an individual operator with exclusive operation rights.!7 The Terms of

the Tender (hereinafter, the “Terms of the Tender”) provided that:

a) Every prospective bidder should file a technical offer with a rate structure

and calculations.18

s

The rate applicable to the VTI service would be charged directly to users, this
rate may not exceed the one specified by the bidder in his offer, and in case
the bidder was awarded, the rate would become an integral part of the

binding commitments.!9

c) The revenue received by the concession holder would be limited to the rate
that could be charged directly to service users, and the offered rate values for
each service would be reviewed annually, according to a study prepared by
the contractor and approved by the MPWT and the institution responsible for
approving those rates, in order to avoid harming the economic and financial

balance of the successful bidder.”

d) The term of the contract would be ten years, which may be extended once the
performance of obligations, the returns and the efficiency in providing the
services, the adequacy of the personnel and other aspects necessary to
evaluate the good operation of the different stations had been confirmed by

the corresponding technical authority in a written report.2!

e) It would be a cause for termination of the contract if the contractor were to

charge users a rate higher or lower than the approved rates.”

f) The term for providing the VTI services would be ten years,” starting from
the date of commencement of operations of the VTIC.* The successful bidder
would have a maximum of eleven months to begin operations from the date

the Comptroller countersigned the contract.

Differences between the Administration and the contractor would be settled

cd

in an amicable manner, by direct official negotiations and in case of not being
able to settle them within thirty days, differences would be submitted to

arbitration or to the corresponding court proceeding.

On July 2, 1998, SyC entered into an agreement with the Costa Rican company Transal
S.A., pursuant to which the consortium Riteve SyC (the “Consortium”) was formed, in

order to submit a bid within the framework of the Tender.”

On July 7, 1998, the Consortium submitted its Bid (the “Bid” or “Offer”) within the

Tender proceeding before the Procurement Office.28

In its bid, the Consortium proposed an average rate of CRC € 7,964 (seven thousand
nine hundred sixty-four colones) for the first year of service, and proposed a cost
structure for the implementation of the rate adjustment formula, in order to maintain

the economic balance of the contract.”
Similarly, in its Bid the Consortium projected that the provision of VTI service would

obtain between 1998 and 2008 an internal return rate of around 13.28%, and an annual

growth of 7% in the initial inspections.*°

On November 24, 1998, the Committee on Analysis and Recommendation for
Administrative Contracting after conducting an analysis of the bids submitted in the
Tender, recommended to award the contract to the Consortium, because even though
the rate offered was the highest among the various proposals, its Bid got the highest
score under the scoring system designed by Costa Rica for it offered the best technical

and financial conditions and the largest number of stations.

On November 25, 1998 the Procurement Office awarded the Tender to the Consortium,

under the Terms of the Tender and the bid.22

On February 1, 1999, by Ruling No. LPI2-98 CHG the Procurement Office declared the
Consortium a successful bidder. The award of the Tender to the Consortium was
questioned by other bidders, who filed an appeal against that decision, and in light of
said appeal the Comptroller General of the Republic of Costa Rica (the “Comptroller”)
annulled the award by resolution RSL-231-99 dated June 7, 1999 and ordered the

Administration to make a more comprehensive analysis of the Consortium’s proposal.*4

After a second analysis conducted by the Committee on Analysis and Recommendation
for Administrative Contracting, on November 25, 1999, the Procurement Office re-

awarded the Tender to the Consortium, by a re-award ruling LPI-number 002-98.25

The re-award ruling issued by the Procurement Office was also questioned by third
parties through appeals, but the Comptroller General confirmed the decision by Ruling
RC-120-2000. %¢

62. On February 5, 2001, the Consortium and the Public Transportation Council

63.

(hereinafter, the “PTC”) entered into a first contract (the “First Contract”) for the

exclusive provision of the VTI service.2” This First Contract established the following:

a) In clause 9.1, that the contract between the Consortium and_ the
Administration had “...as a fundamental principle the maintenance of the
contract's economic and financial balance, so changes in costs or in the formula
determined by the parties would generate an obligation to readjust the rates such that

the CONTRACTOR could recover the costs of its operation and a reasonable
profit...”38

b) In clause 9.4.1, that the rate adjustments would be automatic, based on
indexes, excluding the MPWT’s faculty to approve the rates readjustments

provided in the Tender.*9

On March 13, 2001, through the official letter No. 001093, the Vice Chair of the PTC sent
the First Contract to the Comptroller General for its countersignature.“” However, the
First Contract was returned to the PTC without the corresponding countersignature
through the official notice No. 4579 dated May 3, 2001 (the “Non-Countersignature
Official Notice”). The Comptroller General made the following observations regarding

the conditions for an eventual extension of the contract:

“.,.the possibility of extending an administrative contract emerges from the
discretion that the Public Administration has ... [I]t is the Administration that

has, in principle, the power to determine whether or not it is convenient to extend

37 Counter-Memorial § 47.

38 Counter-Memorial § 48.

3° Counter-Memorial § 49.

4 The countersignature is an act of approval by the Comptroller General, which gives legal effects to the acts it
approves or countersigns. In the case of administrative contracts, the countersignature takes place after the stage
in which the contract is perfected; reviewing that the content of the contract adheres to the principles of legality.
The governmental entity that has entered into the contract has the legal obligation to obtain the approval of the
Comptroller General, its countersignature, prior to granting the order to begin the execution of the contract, in
accordance with Article 134 paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Costa Rica. Incase the Controller's
countersignature is not obtained, the act not countersigned is sanctioned with absolute nullity, so it cannot be
executed. See: Statement of Allan Roberto Ugalde §§ 19 to 23, as well as the Statement of Manuel Corrales Umafia
§§ 11 to 13.

30

the contract, and to propose [to] the contractor such possibility to see if he agrees...
it is not admissible to seek, through this contract, the limitation of the power of the
Administration, trying to hold the State upon an eventual extension that, as
provided in the document submitted to our knowledge, is mandatory for the
Council as long as the contractor meets its obligations. We are facing a wrong
interpretation of the national legislation... upon the conclusion of the contractual
term, the Council that started it shall evaluate the convenience of extending the
current legal business for ten more years, or to implement a new procedure for the

selection of a contractor to continue providing this service...”*

64. Therefore, the proposed conditions for application of the contract extension were
rejected "...since they are not fully adjusted to the normative provisions of the legal order..." #2
Likewise, the Comptroller noted deficiencies regarding the mechanism of economic and
financial balance of the contract that it was intended to adopt. Specifically, the

Comptroller found that the mechanism was inapplicable because:

“, fit] is not legally viable to limit the recognition of the readjustment to the scope
of a determinate percentage of inflationary growth” because “due to the nature
of the service provision, the application of the automatic readjustment formula
presented at that moment was not admissible, because it related more to the
contracts for good and services by the Administration with private individuals,
and not with a relation that would involve a public service like the one

[tendered]”**

65. On February 8, 2001, the corporation Riteve SyC S.A. (hereinafter, “Riteve”) was
incorporated in Costa Rica, with an authorized capital stock of USD $6,900,000.00 (six
million nine hundred thousand) dollars composed of 6,900 (six thousand nine hundred)

common registered shares of USD $1,000 (one thousand) dollars each. The corporation

SyC owns 3,795 (three thousand seven hundred ninety-five) common registered shares

of the capital stock, representing fifty-five percent (55%) of the capital stock.

On May 29, 2001, in light of the Comptroller’s opinion contained in the official notice

dated May 3, 2001, the PTC of the MPWT and the Consortium negotiated and signed a

new and final contract, entitled “Contract for the Provisions of Services for the Creation and

Operation of Stations for Integrated Vehicular Technical Inspection, entered into between the

Public Transportation Council and the Riteve-SyC Consortium, composed of the Companies

Transal S.A. and Supervision y Control S.A.” (hereinafter, the "Contract"). SyC signed

directly as a party to such contract.4° The Contract set forth the following terms, among

others:

a

d

e

The term “fee adjustment” is defined as a “[rJevision of the fees according to the
procedure determined by the parties, to adapt [them] to the increase experienced by
the contractor in the cost of the service that it provides or to adjust [them] to the

economic indices that have previously been defined.” ”

The exclusivity rights to provide the integrated VTI services in all the

territory of Costa Rica.48

PTC's obligation to “Approve the fee adjustments for the contractor” according to

chapter nine of the Contract.‘

The initial rates, these being the ones provided in the Consortium’s offer.5°

PTC's obligation to design and publish a special procedure which provides a

methodology for the adjustment of rates before the beginning of operations.*!

f) Regarding the readjustment of rates for the provision of services:

“9.1 ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL BALANCE UNDER THE CONTRACT.
A fundamental principle of this contracting process is maintaining the economic
and financial balance of the contract, and, therefore, if any substantial changes in

costs occur, the provisions of Clause 9.4 below shall be applicable...” 52

“9.4 ADJUSTMENT OF FEES. In accordance with the principle established in
Clause 9.1 above, the fees shall be adjusted ordinarily once a year or are specially
[sic] whenever situations occur that alter the economic-financial balance of the

contract.”53

g) The extensions to the ten year term of the Contract, setting the agreed
conditions under which the extension of the term of the Contract would not
occur, consisting of: (i) the preparation of a technical report on the failure of
the contractor to fulfill its obligations, submitted before the Board of Directors
of the PTC (hereinafter, “Board of Directors”) at least six months before the
date of the next extension; and (ii) the communication addressed to the
contractor on the basis of the above mentioned technical report, no less than

six months before the date of extension. *4

h) Arbitration in Costa Rica under the Law of Alternative Dispute Resolution
and Promotion of Social Peace as a mechanism for resolving disputes or

disagreements related to the Contract.*5

On June 28, 2001, the Comptroller countersigned the Contract, by official notice No. DI-
AA-1793, referring to its observations on the defects of the First Contract, in which the
MPWT became "... a mere verifier of the increases produced in the agreed-upon prices indices

included in the proposed mathematical formula, without permitting it to make the technical

studies provided in Article 20 of the Traffic Act...”, and countersigned the Contract because
“...[it] could verify that the Administration actually implemented the observations
expressed...” by the Comptroller’s Office in its official notice dated May 3, 2001 (the
“Countersignature Official Notice”). Also, the Comptroller’s Office emphasized the
PTC’s faculty to design a procedure that includes a rate adjustment mechanism
"...which would evaluate all those costs and expenses incurred by the contractor that are directly
involved in the provision of the contracted service, and that have actually affected the contract's

financial balance ...”56

On November 15, 2001, a proposal on the procedure for calculating rates to be charged
for the VTI services was submitted for the approval of the Board of Directors. The Board
of Directors approved the methodology for the readjustment of the rates and
recommended its approval to the Minister of Public Works and Transportation, Mr.

Carlos Castro Arias.5”

On March 6, 2002, based on the recommendation of the Board of Directors, the MPWT
and the President of the Republic issued and published in the Gazette the Executive
Order 30185-MPWT, entitled “Procedural Regulations for Rate Readjustments for the
Technical Vehicle Inspection [VTI] Service Charged to the Consortium of Riteve SyC"
(hereinafter, "Executive Order 30185"). The executive order included the obligation of
an ordinary annual adjustment of rates in order to update the values of costs and
expenses related to the provision of the service.* This automatic adjustment formula
required the adjustments to update "...all the costs and expenses directly involved in the

provision of the contracted service, except the investment. .."59

On April 15, 2002, by official notice No. 4163, the Comptroller ruled on a request for the
annulment of the Tender, emphasizing on one hand that the power to set VTI service

rates "...is exclusive to [MPWT], as indicated by article 20 of the Transit Law” and that the

model for rates’ readjustment should include the actual costs and expenses incurred by
the contractor in providing the service. On the other hand, official notice No. 4163
argued that one of the reasons the first version of the Agreement was rejected was "...
the Administration's lack of tools to assure an agreement between the costs incurred by the
contractor and the fee it would charge the final users..." and for that purpose quoted the
official notice No. 4579 (DI-AA-1159) dated May 3, 2001, which states that "...the entity
in charge of price regulation, must verify the suitable correspondence between the real costs of
the execution of the service and the components that structure this price..." Also, in that official
notice, it is clarified that, regarding the first version of the Contract "...originally the
revision pricing system presented in this version of the contract includes a revision mechanism
based on automatic increases linked with increases that had taken place in the price indexes
selected, which turned out to be of the ‘general’ type ... this caused this Entity Comptroller to
make the Administration see the unsuitability of such a mechanism ... [in light of] this
observation, the model initially used was modified, going from one based on indexes, to a model
that would rather comprise the real costs incurred by the contractor, as established by clause 9.4

of the contract endorsed by this General Comptroller's office..." ©

On April 25, 2002, the Board of Directors approved the adjustments to the VTI rates,
based on financial and accounting information submitted by Riteve and the automatic

rate adjustment formula established in Executive Order 30185.

On May 7, 2002, the government of Costa Rica issued Executive Order 30396-MPWT
(hereinafter, “Executive Order 30396”) through which the readjusted rates for the
beginning of operations of the VTI by the Consortium were issued. This order was
published about two months later, on July 12, 2002. Between the rates submitted by
the Consortium within its Offer in 1998 and the rates published through the Executive

Order 30396, there was an average increase of 30.39%.

On May 8, 2002 there was a change in government and Mr. Abel Pacheco de la Espriella
became President of the Republic and Mr. Javier Chaves Bolafios became Minister of

Public Works and Transportation.®

During the first days of the new administration, there were protest marches against the
Contract’s entry into force, because vehicle owners were opposed to the idea of being

required to have their vehicles inspected.

On June 19, 2002 the Board of Directors accepted the request of the Chairman of the
Board and Vice Minister of Transportation, Karla Gonzalez, consisting of (i) revoking
the resolution adopted by the Board of Directors on November 15, 2001, which gave
rise to the issuance of Executive Order 30185, for being contrary to the opinions of the
Comptroller’s Office; (ii) recommending the Minister of Public Works and
Transportation the revocation of that order, as well as the resolution of April 25, 2002
which was the basis of Executive Order 30396; and (iii) commissioning the Chairman
of the Board of Directors to coordinate the presentation of a new proposal of a

methodology for the VTI rates readjustment system.®

On July 2002, the new Vice Minister of Transportation requested Mr. Stephan Brunner
and Mr. Luis Diego Vargas to develop a study related to the rates applicable to the VTI
service in order to suggest to the PTC what rates to apply during the Consortium’s first
year of operations, which would begin on July 15, 2002. According to his statement, Mr.
Brunner conducted the study following only the MPWT’s instructions, without taking
into account the Terms of the Tender, the Contract, or the texts of the Executive Orders
30185-MPWT (Methodology for the readjustment of rates applicable to the VTI service)
and 30396-MPWT (Rates applicable to the VTI rates). The rate recommended to the PTC

was lower than the readjustment requested by the Consortium. 7

On July 2, 2002, the Board of Directors met in order to execute what was agreed in the
meeting of June 19, 2002, and approved new initial rates for providing the VTI service.
Such rates were published through Executive Order 30572 dated July 12, 2002, entitled
“Amendments to the ‘Regulations for the Integrated Technical Inspection of Automotive
Vehicles Circulating on Public Roads” (hereinafter, “Executive Order 30572”).°8 There was
a difference of approximately 6.3% between the rates initially approved by the Board of
Directors on April 25, 2002 (which served as a basis for Executive Order 30396) and
those it approved on July 2, 2002. To make the adjustment to the rates, the Board of
Directors used the study conducted by Messrs. Luis Diego Vargas and Stephan

Brunner.”

On July 5, 2002, three days after the approval of the adjusted rates, Riteve
communicated to the MPWT its acceptance of the initial adjusted rates,”! and on July
11, 2002, the Deputy Minister of Transportation sent to Riteve the official
communication No. DVT-02-572, explaining therein that the initial rates based on the
report of Messrs. Brunner and Vargas had been adjusted, following the instructions of

the Comptroller.72

On July 12, 2002, three days before the initiation of operations of the Consortium, Costa
Rica published in the Gazette the Executive Order 30573-MPWT (hereinafter,
“Executive Order 30573”). This Executive Order derogated Executive Order 30185,
through which the procedure for the readjustment of vehicle technical inspection rates
had been issued, and Executive Order 30396, through which the initial rates were

established, consequently granting the PTC greater powers to control those rates.”

With respect to Executive Order 30573, it is important to mention the following:

a) It invoked, as the grounds to derogate Executive Order 30185, the
Comptroller Office’s official notice dated May 3, 2001, by which it rejected the
First Contract, given that if the rate revision mechanism provided in
Executive Order 30185 was approved, PTC’s competence would be reduced,
and instead of exercising its role as service regulator it would become simply
“...mere verifier of the changes in the sources of the indices used and proper
application, algebraically, of the mathematical formula...” Quoting the same
official notice, the Executive Order 30573 also established that “...price
readjustment is an inherent right that assists the contractor... it is not legally feasible
to limit the recognition of the readjustment to reaching a certain percentage of
inflationary growth ..., but that the contractor can gain access to the readjustment
from the moment when the costs of providing the service increase, which must be
documented and in any case, submitted for approval of the Board of Public

Transportation ...”74

s

It indicated that since it was based on the provisions and methodology of
Executive Order 30185, Executive Order 30396 should also be declared null

and void.”

Riteve filed a claim against the PTC and the State before the Administrative Contentious
Court of the Second Judicial Circuit of San José de Goicochea (hereinafter the
“Administrative Contentious Court”), in which it requested the annulment of
Executive Order 30573. Such claim was ruled by judgment issued on November 28,
2012, in which the Administrative Contentious Court declared that the content of the
challenged executive order is “...absolutely legal...”, that the Executive Orders 30185 and
30396 did not confer to Riteve any personal right and that the reason they were

derogated was justified in Executive Order 30573.76

On July 15, 2002, the Consortium began providing the VTI services to the Costa Rican
public,” applying the initial rates recently adjusted and approved by the Board of
Directors on April 25, 2002.78

On February 19, 2003 the Executive Order No. 30987-MPWT entitled “Procedural
Regulations for Rate Readjustment of the Technical Vehicle Inspection Service [VTI] Charged
to the Consortium of Riteve SyC” was published, and it was corrected by errata and
published on February 28, 2003 (hereinafter, “Executive Order 30987”). This Regulation

stated that the rates adjustments shall be made with the “...purpose of ensuring the
contract's economic and financial balance, in accordance with the valuation of duly confirmed
real costs necessary for the performance of the Agreement" so the requests for rate
adjustments should include the “...economic and financial study demonstrating the change
in the costs... "79 This regulation set the guiding principles for VTI rates adjustment, but

failed to include any formula.®°

On July 8, 2003, Riteve submitted a request before the PTC for an extraordinary rates
readjustment for the VTI service.8! Regarding this request it is important to mention the

following:

a) Riteve requested an extraordinary rate readjustment of 26.58%, arguing that
it was the appropriate increase based on the rate stated in the Offer of July

1998.82

b) When studied by the Board of Directors on July 22, 2003, the PTC executive
director noted in the meeting that the request proposed “...a formula that was
used in regulations that were in force when the Agreement with the company was
approved, which is based on the costs of labor, depreciation percentages, maintenance,

etc., and then adjusted those parameters according to the inflation indices. Instead of

recurring to increases in the company’s real costs, what [it] does is adjust them

according to general indices.” 83

c) On September 16, 2003, the Board of Directors responded to the request by
increasing the rate established in July 2002—not the one offered by the
Consortium in 1998—by 13.13%, basing the increase on changes in price
indexes (between July 1, 2002 and September 30, 2003), as well as information

from Riteve’s financial statements.

d

On October 23, 2003, the Board of Directors reevaluated the formula they had
previously approved on September 16, 2003. The figures of the variables
(wage indices, exchange rate variation, price indices, construction indices,
etc.) in the formula were slightly modified, keeping the rate increase of
13.13%.84 This increase, however, was never published by Executive Order

nor did it gain legal authority.*>

By official notice FOE-108 OP-25/2003 dated October 31, 2003, the Comptroller’s Office
ordered the Board of Directors to issue “...relevant instructions, such that by means of the
rate setting that would take effect as of 2004, maintenance of the Agreement’s economic and
financial balance would be ensured...”, and in response to that instruction, the Board of
Directors decided to contract a company by tender to recommend how to proceed in

the matter of establishing the rate adjustment mechanism.%

On November 18, 2003, Riteve filed an amparo proceeding before the Constitutional
Chamber of the Supreme Court of Costa Rica (hereinafter, the “Supreme Court”),
against the MPWT and the Chairman of the PTC, requesting (i) that the State answer
the request for rate readjustment of July 8, 2003, and (ii) that the State design a

methodology for rate readjustment.’” Regarding such proceeding:

a) Through judgment number 2004-03741 issued on April 16, 2004, the Supreme
Court ordered the MPWT and the Chairman of the PTC to answer and inform
the writ submitted on behalf of Riteve on July 8, 2003.88

s

Riteve alleged the infringement of the instructions contained in the referred
judgment, through a new amparo proceeding; however, the Constitutional
Chamber of the Supreme Court, in its judgment No. 2004-13976 dated
December 3, 2004, stated that “...the action of disobedience submitted by the
protected company is unlawful, since it is clear that the Public Transport Council, as
competent entity to rule on the request submitted, issued its ruling and gave notice
of it within the period provided...it is seen that such entity ruled on the claims
included in the action... in the referred agreement the Council approved the proposed
methodology for rate calculation, and ordered that the new rates applicable to the
vehicle technical inspection service will govern as of January 1, 2005, upon
submission by the protected company of its audited financial statements with rate
opinion as of September 2004...”8° The State fulfilled the Supreme Court's order
on May 28, 2004, and on the same day the Board of Directors approved the
methodology for rate calculation proposed by the firm Despacho Carvajal y
Consultores S.A. (hereinafter, the "Carvajal Firm") in its report dated May 19,
2004.9

On April 26, 2004, Addendum No. 1 to the Contract was signed, establishing that in the
future Riteve would be the contractor and not the Consortium. The Contract remained

the same in all other aspects.”

On April 30, 2004, Riteve initiated a local arbitration proceeding in Costa Rica, against
the Attorney General’s Office, as representative of the State, and the PTC, invoking

clause 11.1.3 of the Contract, before the Center for Resolution of Property Conflicts

(hereinafter “Local Arbitration’), alleging that the PTC had breached its obligations

under the Contract. * Regarding the Local Arbitration it is important to mention that:

a) On June 2, 2004, an ad-hoc arbitral tribunal was formed, based in San José,
Costa Rica, composed of arbitrators Eduardo Sancho Gonzalez, Rodrigo

Montenegro Trejos and Aldo Milano Sanchez.%

b) On June 24, 2004, Riteve filed its claim memorial against the PTC and Costa
Rica for the alleged infringement of contractual obligations. The purpose of
that claim was, mainly, that the arbitral tribunal: (i) declare that PTC
breached the contract by not updating Riteve’s rates in a timely manner; (ii)
declare the correct methodology that should be applied to the rate’s
readjustment; and (iii) require the PTC and the MPWT to compensate Riteve

for the damages and lost profits caused by the alleged breach of contract.

Re

On July 22, 2004, the PTC answered the arbitral claim, filing the motion to
dismiss for lack of jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal to rule on matters of
imperium, such as the determination of rates for a public service, for
considering that it is an exclusive State power entrusted to the MPWT. The
Arbitral Tribunal denied the motion to dismiss, and the PTC filed an appeal

before the Supreme Court.%

d) On October 21, 2004, the First Chamber of the Supreme Court issued
judgment 906 A-04, by which it determined that the Arbitral Tribunal lacked
jurisdiction to rule on the disputes between Riteve and the PTC, and that the
determination of rates is an imperium power that corresponds only to the State

of Costa Rica, being a governmental power and not a consensual element of

the Contract.% The Court stated that “...[i]f the exercise of that public power is
non-transferable and unwaivable, it cannot be subject of an arbitral proceeding,
although, of course, they do not escape the control of the administrative-contentious
jurisdiction...”, referring to Riteve’s possibility to file its claims by means of a

contentious-administrative action.”

e) On July 18, 2005, the Arbitral Tribunal ended the arbitral proceeding due to

lack of jurisdiction.

In 2004, the PTC hired the Carvajal Firm by tender to develop a methodology for the

VTI service rate readjustment.” The report of the Carvajal Firm:

a) Considered the official notice of October 31, 2003 issued by the Comptroller
Office.

b) Considered the provisions referring to the need to “...establish formulas for

ensuring the adjustment and financial balance of the [VTI] contract ...”

Determined that the economic and financial balance of the Contract had been.

maintained from July 2002 (start of operations) until December 2003, taking
into account the 13% return on projected billing by the Consortium in its

offer.100

During the May 28, 2004 ordinary session, the PTC agreed to approve the methodology
proposed by Carvajal Firm in its report of May 19, 2004. This adjustment methodology

was again approved in an extraordinary session on December 9, 2004.19

On November 23, 2004, Riteve submitted before the PTC a request for the readjustment
of rates.!2 In the session of December 16, 2004, the Board of Directors addressed the
request and approved a 12.76% increase on VTI rates for 2005 (hereinafter, the “Increase
Agreement”), based on the rate readjustment contained in the audited financial
statements submitted by Riteve and following the methodology suggested by Carvajal

Firm.' Regarding this Increase Agreement:

a) Riteve opposed the Increase Agreement, filing before the PTC a motion for
revocation with appeal, questioning the rate readjustment methodology
proposed by the Carvajal Firm. Such motion was dismissed on the basis of

lateness and lack of legal grounds.1%

b) On February 28, 2006 Riteve filed an ordinary proceeding before the
Administrative Contentious Court against the PTC and the State, requesting
the agreement be declared null and an order to pay damages and lost

profits. 105

On September 29, 2005, the Board of Directors agreed to sign an agreement with the
Institute for Research in Economic Sciences at the University of Costa Rica (hereinafter,
“IRES”) in order for the latter to suggest the rate to be charged in 2006, developing a
new rate methodology through the project entitled “Rate Model for the Vehicle
Inspection of the Public Transport Council”.1% In view of this specific cooperation
agreement, signed on October 26, 2005,1°” IRES prepared a report, which was approved
by the Board of Directors on December 16, 2005.18

On December 15, 2005, Riteve submitted before the PTC a request for the readjustment

of rates.1°° The Board of Directors analyzed that request and rejected it on January 12,

2006, “...for having been submitted in an untimely manner- one month after the deadline set by

the regulations..."

On January 24, 2006, the PTC published in The Gazette the draft of the new rate
methodology proposal, based on the IRES report.

On February 28, 2006, Riteve began an ordinary judicial proceeding against the State,
before the Administrative Contentious Court, for the alleged breach of Contract by the

PTC and the State. In that regard:
a) Riteve filed a second claim, which was joined to the previous one.

b) In its claims, Riteve requested the Administrative Contentious Court: (i) to
declare the nullity of the Executive Order No. 30573; (ii) to declare valid and
effective the Executive Orders No. 30185 and 30396; (iii) to annul the Increase
Agreement approved by the Board of Directors on December 15, 2004, which
increased rates for 2005 based on the methodology proposed by Carvajal
Firm; (iv) to command the MPWT to set the technical inspection rates based
on the rate model provided in the Terms of the Tender, the Offer and the
Contract; and (v) to sentence the State to pay damages and lost profits for an
amount of CRC €2,850,000.000 (two million eight hundred fifty thousand
colons), equivalent to USD $1,400,000.00 (one million four hundred thousand

dollars).1!2

c) On November 28, 2012, the Administrative Contentious Court issued the
judgment No. 2869-2012, rejecting Riteve’s claims. The judgment concluded
that Riteve failed to prove, in the absence of evidence, that it had suffered an

economic and financial imbalance of the Contract.113

d) The trial court judgment was confirmed by the Appeals Court on August 19,
2013. Against this ruling, Riteve filed a cassation appeal, which the Supreme

Court rejected by unanimous vote on December 5, 2013.

On March 7, 2006, Riteve submitted before the PTC an extraordinary request for the

readjustment of rates.1!4

On May 2, 2006, IRES submitted to the Board of Directors a second report with a

methodology proposal for the adjustment of rates."

On November 15, 2006, Riteve submitted before the PTC another request for the
readjustment of rates.!!6 Both requests were considered by the Board of Directors for
their study and analysis in its session of December 19, 2006, requesting Riteve the
audited financial statements of 2006, with their corresponding report for the period of

October 2005 to September 2006 and the statistical information of that period.”

On December 19, 2006, the Board of Directors agreed to approve the rate methodology
proposed by IRES.1!8 Regarding the report and its approval, it is worth mentioning:

a) The report proposed “...an inflation-neutral model for recovery of nominal costs
for the company, that is to say, that the effective inflation adjustment ceiling as such
was cancelled out by the real relative costs adjusted by the same inflation parameter

and then adjusted for productivity...” 9

s

Riteve rejected the methodology proposed in that report, filing a motion for
revocation with appeal and nullification of the agreement that had approved
such methodology. Riteve requested that in its place, the formula approved
by the PTC on October 23, 2003 be applied, despite the fact it never gained

Re

legal enforceability.12° Based on the IRES technical criteria, the Board of
Directors rejected that motion for revocation. Furthermore, because the
motion for revocation was accompanied by an appeal, it was forwarded to
the MPWT, who admitted the appeal and annulled the agreement reached in
ordinary session of December 19, 2006 because it had procedural defects,
having been decided without granting a hearing to Riteve. In its ruling, the
MPWT urged the PTC to develop a new rate methodology by collaborating
with the Public Services Regulatory Authority (hereinafter “PSRA”).12!
Consequently, Riteve was granted a hearing and in light of its observations,
the IRES upheld its conclusions of previous reports, confirming the validity

of the methodology contained in the draft published on January 24, 2006.

In view of the above, the Board of Directors approved the IRES rate

adjustment model in its session of August 11, 2009.122

On November 14, 2007, Riteve submitted before the PTC a request for the readjustment

of rates.123

On November 14, 2008, Riteve submitted before the PTC a request for the readjustment

of rates.124

On December 17, 2008, a Reform to Act 7331, entitled Act of Transit by Terrestrial Public
Roads, was approved by Act 8696. Act 8696 provided in Article 19 that the VTI would

be provided in the service centers of the companies to which the Ministry of Works

awarded that concession by public tender, promoting the greatest possible number of

service providers. It also determined that the PSRA had the authority to review the

vehicle inspection rates, regardless of whether under the Contract it had been agreed

that the rate approval was a prerogative of the PTC.!25 Also, under this reform the
Minister of Public Works and Transport became competent to decide contractual
extension for the VTI service.!26 It is noteworthy that Riteve remained as the only VTI

service provider in Costa Rica, despite the provisions of Act 8696.12”

On November 13, 2009, Riteve submitted before the PSRA a request for the
readjustment of rates, based on the methodology approved in the session of October 23,

2003.18 In relation to this request:

a) The Regulatory Committee of the PSRA (hereinafter, the “Regulatory
Committee”), created for the function of setting rates for public services and
to rule on the motions for revocation filed against the PSRA’s actions, rejected
the readjustment request on July 2, 2010, stating that it did not meet the
admissibility requirement to provide a PTC certification indicating the

current methodology for rate adjustment.!2°

b) The Regulatory Committee reconsidered the request, and on December 11,
2012, it decided that since Riteve was the exclusive provider of VTI services,
the PSRA was not competent to act as the regulatory authority. Moreover,
because the Contract’s provision should be enforced, the competent entity to
approve the methodology was the MPWT, not PSRA. For the foregoing
reasons, the Regulatory Committee decided to reject the request for the

adjustment of rates.130

104. On December 17, 2009, the PSRA requested the PTC to publish in the Gazette the rate

adjustment mathematical formula, given that the PTC had not done so to that date.13!

On April 29, 2010, the Chairman of the Libertarian Movement, the Minister of the
Presidency and the Chief of the National Liberation Party entered into a Political
Agreement in order to ensure good governance, called "Commitment to Improve
Governance in Costa Rica and to respond in a more timely way to Development
Challenges”. Said agreement records the government’s commitment to eliminate the
exclusivity granted by contract to the Consortium in order to open the market to several

operators. 152

On June 15, 2010, the PSRA requested from the PTC the methodology for rate

readjustment.13

On November 12, 2010, Riteve submitted a new request for rate readjustment, based on
the rate adjustment methodology proposed by the Carvajal Firm. The Regulatory
Committee rejected the request on December 22, 2010, claiming that it did not meet the
admissibility requirement to provide a PTC certificate indicating the current

methodology for rate adjustment.14

On November 17, 2010, the PSRA again requested from the PTC the methodology for

the readjustment of rates and the evidence of its publication in the Gazette.1°5

On May 9, 2011, the MPWT issued Ruling 333 by virtue of which it decided not to
extend the Contract, urging the Road Safety Council (hereinafter, “COSEVI”) to
promote a tender to award to the greatest possible number of companies the concession
for the provision of the VTI service.1%6 The decision not to extend the Contract was taken
without complying with the requirements referred to in clause 4.2 of the Contract, i.e.

the issuance of a report.!37

On May 26, 2011, Riteve submitted before the MPWT the official notice No. 052501-2011
requesting, in accordance with clause 4.2 of the Contract, that the MPWT deliver
COSEVI’s Technical Report on which the decision not to extend the Contract was based.
Also, Riteve indicated that such decision would imply not enforcing clause 12.6 of the
Contract in relation to the contractor’s donation of property, facilities and equipment to
the Costa Rican State, that the agreement to grant the use of the facilities that Riteve
made available to the MPWT would become ineffective in accordance with clause 3.2.13
of the Contract, and that Riteve’s obligation to periodically calibrate the Executive
Power's inspection line which was donated to the Administration according to clause
3.2.14 of the Contract would also be invalidated. In view of the foregoing, COSEVI’s
Executive Management proceeded to issue a technical report on the possible extension
of the Contract in accordance with clause 4.2 of such Contract. Additionally, the report
showed that there had been no breaches in nine years on Riteve’s part, and that the

continuity of the VTI service is considered of public interest.198

On November 14, 2011, Riteve submitted before the PSRA a request for the
readjustment of rates!3° based on the rate adjustment methodology proposed by the
Carvajal Firm. The Regulatory Committee rejected the request on December 15, 2011,
alleging that it did not meet the admissibility requirement to provide the certification

from PTC indicating what the current methodology for rate adjustment was.!40

On November 17, 2011, PSRA again requested from the PTC the methodology for the

readjustment of rates, as well as the evidence of its publication in the Gazette."

On June 15, 2012, the MPWT, based on the analysis of the COSEVI Legal Advisor's
Office, considering of public interest to ensure the continuity of the VTI service, revoked
the decision not to extend the Contract; therefore, derogating and annulling Ruling 333

of May 9, 2011, and extending the Contract for another 10 years, starting from July 15,

Contract], it must be understood that the contract term is extended for another term of equal

length, that will become effective as of July 15, 2012...” 142

On July 20, 2012, approximately one month after revoking the decision not to extend

the Contract, the MPWT signed the following two agreements with Riteve:

a)

A direct agreement within the framework of the Contract, which stated that:
(i) the government of Costa Rica had decided to extend the term of the
Contract from July 16, 2012 to July 15, 2022; (ii) regarding the establishment
of the methodology for the applicable rate readjustment between 2012 and
2022, the MPWT prepared in the Ordinary Session 37-2004 of May 27, 2004
and again in the Extraordinary Session 19-2004 of December 9, 2004, an
executive order draft entitled "Regulation of the Procedure for the Adjustment of
Rates for Vehicle Technical Inspection Service (VTI) handled by Riteve SyC SA", in
order for PSRA to approve the rates for this service for the Contract’s
extension and to regulate the rate adjustments for the entire term according
to the formula resulting from the methodology approved by the PTC when it
was competent to do so (hereinafter, “Direct Agreement"). The MPWT
committed to publish the methodology before August 10, 2012, including the
corresponding rates, and Riteve accepted that upon fulfillment of the above,

it would forego any additional rate claim."

A contractual addendum to modify clauses 7, 8 and 11 of the Contract, in
order to (i) clarify the scope of the reports Riteve must submit; (ii) establish
the competence of COSEVI in relation to investigation, and (iii) incorporate

international arbitration as the mechanism to resolve any dispute arising

between the Parties in relation to the Contract (hereinafter, the "Contractual

Addendum").

Costa Rica did not publish the methodology for rates readjustment before August 10,
2012 as provided in the Direct Agreement of July 20, 2012.15

On October 26, 2012, Act 9078 was published setting forth new reforms to the Transit
Law. Section V of this new law, entitled "Vehicle Inspection", provided MPWT with the
power to review all state or private entities that meet the requirements outlined in the
Act, and grant, through COSEVI, authorizations to vehicle technical inspection centers
(hereinafter, “VTIC"), defining these as state or private entities for technical-mechanical
motor vehicle inspection. Also, the new law stated in Article 29 that the PSRA would
be competent to "...[perform] the technical studies to establish a tariff model to be used to fix
the tariff bands that define the minimum and maximum amounts that a [VTIC] may charge for

Vehicle inspection and re-inspection...” 146

On November 16, 2012, Riteve submitted before the PSRA a request for the
readjustment of rates. The Regulatory Committee rejected the request on December 11,
2012, claiming that Riteve had not submitted a copy of the Contract’s Addendum and

had not specified the current methodology for rate readjustment.”

VI. CLAIMS OF THE PARTIES

According to its Memorial, Claimant requested the following declarations from the

Arbitral Tribunal:

a) That Respondent has breached its obligations under article III of the BIT

because:

iii.

vi.

viii.

It did not give Claimant's investment fair and equitable treatment at

all times. (Memorial, § 513.)

It incurred in denial of justice by preventing, through a ruling of the
Supreme Court of Justice, that the arbitration mechanism

contractually agreed upon be carried out. (Memorial, § 514.)

It treated Claimant in an unfair and discriminatory manner by not
responding to the requests for readjustment of rates, thereby

preventing the full enjoyment of its investments. (Memorial, § 515.)

It engaged in arbitrary, unilateral and unjust acts through the
derogation of Executive Order 30185, which approved the
methodology for the readjustment of the rates. (Memorial, § 516.)

It engaged in arbitrary and unfair acts by giving Claimant less
favorable treatment as compared to the treatment given to other

investors in public services. (Memorial, § 517.)

It engaged in arbitrary, unilateral and unfair acts upon the approval of
amendments to the Transit Act in 2008 and in 2012, which affected the
exclusive rights granted to Claimant under the Contract. (Memorial,

§ 518.)

It engaged in arbitrary, unilateral and unfair acts by terminating the

Contract through Ruling 333. (Memorial, § 519.)

It committed a “serious breach of obligations agreed to in the contract for

the provision of technical vehicle inspection.” (Memorial, § 520.)

53

b) That Respondent has breached its obligations under article V of the BIT by
adopting measures equivalent to expropriation by terminating the Contract

and affecting the exclusive operating rights thereunder. (Memorial, § 521.)

Re

That Respondent is liable for the breach of its obligations under the BIT and
therefore is obligated to pay lost profits to Claimant in an amount no less than
€261,600,000.00 (two hundred sixty-one million six hundred thousand euros),
which includes what was not received due to the lack of rate adjustments and
damages for the termination of the exclusive right to operate in Costa Rica

between 2012 and 2022. (Memorial, § 522.)

d) That Respondent is obligated to pay Claimant all the costs and expenses

incurred as a result of this arbitration. (Memorial, § 523.)

119. Inits Counter-Memorial, Respondent requested the Tribunal to:

a) Declare that it lacks jurisdiction to hear and rule on the dispute brought by

the Claimant; or

b) Reject all the claims of Claimant as legally and factually invalid. (Counter-
Memorial, § 681.)

Vill. ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES

From the narration of arguments and positions by the Parties in their memorials and
briefs, the statements of both Parties in the hearing, and the various documents that
both Parties attached to their briefs, the following arguments in relation to the disputed

points can be discerned:

A. JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

1. OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION

(i) Position of SyC

SyC states that on February 28, 2013 the deadline for Costa Rica to present its Counter-
Memorial expired, and therefore by presenting its Counter-Memorial on March 1, 2013,
Costa Rica’s objections on jurisdiction were not timely filed under clauses 11.9 and 11.10

of Procedural Order No. 1.148

Consequently, Claimant argues that the Tribunal should apply the legal consequences
provided in Costa Rican law, specifically the provisions of the Administrative and Civil
Procedure Codes according to which “...the court will declare the defendant in violation,
and the facts of the claim will be considered affirmatively answered ...”'4° and “...if the
defendant does not answer the claim within the time established in the summons, the court will
declare the defendant in violation, and the facts of the claim will be considered affirmatively

answered ...”150

(ii) Position of Costa Rica

Costa Rica argues that the request of SyC to consider the claim to have been responded

to affirmatively must be rejected outright, in view of the following:'5!

448 Reply §§ 82-84; Exhibit C-110.

149 Reply § 558; Statement of Laura Rivera of May 28, 2013, § 47.11; Exhibit C-98, Article 65.
150 Reply §§ 557-560; Exhibit C-99, Article 310.

151 Rejoinder §§ 21-33.

56

a

Claimant itself states that it is aware that since it is an arbitral procedure,

substance should prevail over strict formality.1*

s

Costa Rica had already put in evidence the lack of legal grounds for SyC’s
request that its objections should be considered not presented,!3 given that
the request was not grounded on either the ICSID Arbitration Rules or
investment arbitration practice.154 Additionally, SyC did not elaborate on this

matter in subsequent correspondence.

Re

The arbitral proceeding is governed by the ICSID Arbitration Rules,!* as was
established in Procedural Order No. 1, and not by the Costa Rican rules of
procedure invoked by SyC.

d) Article 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules allows the Arbitral Tribunal to

consider jurisdictional matters at any stage of the proceeding, and it has the

duty to assess its own jurisdiction.15°

e

Various arbitral tribunals, as in the case AIG v. Kazakhstan, have admitted
objections to jurisdiction even after the submission of the counter-memorial.
Also in Pezold v. Zimbabwe in which the Tribunal exercised its flexibility and
discretion under Rule 26 (3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and admitted

objections that the State did not present until its Rejoinder.

f) The delay incurred by Costa Rica in filing its Counter-Memorial was of only
four minutes, and SyC did not prove in any way the detriment that this delay
could have caused, since there was none, especially considering that
Claimant requested and subsequently obtained a 25 day extension to file its

Reply, which resulted in an adjustment of the entire procedural calendar.

g) SyC’s request is unprecedented in international arbitration and would result
in serious and irreparable harm to Respondent by denying its right to a

defense.

2. JURISDICTION IN THE CASE OF CLAIMS BASED ON ARTICLE III.2 OF THE TREATY
(i) Position of Costa Rica

Respondent claims that, although Claimant dedicated several paragraphs of its
Memorial to the umbrella clause,’ it did not base any of its claims under this provision,
and therefore the Tribunal should not even consider whether Respondent has breached

the umbrella clause provided in the last sentence of Article IIL.2 of the BIT.

Respondent further states that even if SyC had made a claim under the umbrella clause,
the Arbitral Tribunal would not have jurisdiction under the BIT to rule on it, given that
"... the Umbre[lla] Clause applies to the obligations that the State had acquired with the foreign
investor (in this case, the Claimant), but not the obligations that the State had acquired with a
subsidiary of the investor. In this case, the Claimant bases its apparent claim on the Umbre[lla]
Clause in the Agreement between [PTC] and Riteve SyC, where the Claimant is not a
party...”158 In this regard, Costa Rica cites the case Burlington Resources. v. Ecuador, in
which the majority of the tribunal concluded that the investor cannot rely on the
umbrella clause in a treaty to exercise the contractual rights of its subsidiary against the

State.159

Therefore, Respondent claims that the allegations based on the umbrella clause must be
denied because a direct contractual relationship with the foreign investor does not exist,
considering that since April 26, 2004 until now, the parties to the Contract have been
the State (acting through the MPWT and the PTC) and the Costa Rican company

Riteve.1

157 “Each Party shall comply with any obligation that it has assumed related to investments by investors of the other Party.”
Exhibit C-3.

159 Counter-Memorial § 598; Exhibit RL-100, § 220.

160 Counter-Memorial § 605.

58

129.

130.

Costa Rica claims that SyC is not a party to the Contract, so the Arbitral Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction over SyC’s claims under the "umbrella clause", which Claimant has failed to

refute given that:

a) SyC cannot question that it is not a party in the Contract, since although it
was part of the Consortium, it later assigned all its contractual rights to
Riteve. Thus, SyC ceased to be a party to the Contract since April 26, 2004,
date of the Contractual Addendum by which the assignment of rights was
made, and therefore it was not a party to the Contract when filing its request
before the ICSID. Furthermore, the contractual relationship between Riteve
and the State is subject to Costa Rican law, and SyC has not proved that it can

directly exercise the contractual rights that Riteve has under that law.

s

SyC suggests that Riteve is its vehicle or "alter ego" in respect to the obligations
that Costa Rica assumed under the Contract, but otherwise denies said
relationship regarding its failure to comply the "Fork in the Road Clause" set
forth in the BIT, based on the existing formal difference between the two

companies.

SyC has never disputed Costa Rica’s argument regarding that there should be a direct
contractual relationship between the plaintiff investor and the State for the investor to
invoke the umbrella clause, but focused its argument on the fact that SyC and its
subsidiary Riteve are equivalent for contractual purposes, mainly because of a joint and
several liability of SyC regarding Riteve’s contractual obligations. Costa Rica asserts,
however, that SyC ceased to be a party to the Contract when the Consortium assigned
its rights under the Contract to Riteve on April 26, 2004, and as shown by both the
Addendum Contract dated April 26, 2004 and the one dated July 20, 2012, the contractor
or concessionaire to the State is Riteve, not SyC. Therefore, under the current Contract
the State only has obligations with Riteve. Since the State does not have obligations

with SyC, there is nothing that can be protected by the umbrella clause, being the joint

59

132.

and severed responsibility of the Claimant an obligation with the State, but not vice

versa.16

(ii) Position of SyC

Regarding Costa Rica’s statement that there are no references in section VIII of the
Memorial to the umbrella clause or to the last sentence of Article III.2, as well as the
alleged lack of jurisdiction of ICSID to hear claims under the umbrella clause of the BIT
because of allegations that it is not a party to the Contract, (i) SyC points out that in its
Memorial it requested a declaration that Costa Rica had failed to fulfill obligations

under Article III of the Treaty, "

 

erious[ly] breach[ing] obligations agreed to in the contract
for the provision of technical vehicle inspection..."'%, making it clear that SyC claims
damages for breach of contract which “...were internationalized by virtue of the umbrella
clause...",1 in addition to the fact that when explaining what the umbrella clause is,
reference is made to the section in which the obligations under the Contract are listed;
and (ii) the Contract was not signed by a subsidiary of SyC, as was the case in Burlington
Resources v. Ecuador, but by the Consortium, and considering what a consortium is
under Costa Rican law,1 and since Mr. José Luis Lopez in his status of attorney in fact
for SyC was involved and signed the Contract, it is clear evidence that SyC is a party to

the Contract.

Claimant argues that the existence of joint liability confirms that SyC is a party to the
Contract, given that under Costa Rican law, a contract only produces effects between
the parties, and therefore if SyC has obligations under the Contract, necessarily it is a
party thereto, for the entire performance of the Contract. Claimant also argues that the
assignment of rights and obligations to Riteve did not change its obligations at all, nor

its status as party; such assignment simply consisted of creating a legal entity in Costa

Rica. In this respect, SyC asserts that being party to the Contract, it has legitimacy for

filing claims under the umbrella clause.!

3. FORUM SELECTION CLAUSE CONTAINED IN ARTICLE XI.3 OF THE TREATY
(i) Position of Costa Rica

133. Costa Rica states that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal cannot be based on the presumed
consent granted by Costa Rica by the sole fact of having signed the BIT, which is not
absolute or unlimited. On the contrary, the BIT provides express conditions that

expressly limit the scope of that consent.1&7

134. Respondent argues that the Arbitral Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear and
tule regarding SyC’s claims under the Treaty, because Claimant previously submitted
before a local court in Costa Rica the same dispute about its investment now submitted
before this Tribunal without having adopted the necessary measures to desist definitely

from the judiciary proceedings before the local courts had issued a judgment.168

135. This is because, according to Respondent, SyC failed to comply with the stipulations of
the fork in the road clause, provided in Article X1.3 of the BIT, which stipulates:16

“3. Once an investor has submitted the dispute to an arbitral tribunal, the award
shall be final. If the investor has submitted the dispute to a competent court of the
Party in whose territory the investment was made, it may, in addition, resort to
the arbitral tribunals referred to in this article, if such national court has not issued
a judgment. In the latter case, the investor shall adopt any measures that are
required for the purpose of permanently desisting from the court case then

underway...”

168 Counter-Memorial § 201.

169 Counter-Memorial § 202.

61

136.

137.

138.

Respondent states that Costa Rica’s consent depends on the fulfillment of these
conditions, so that, in this dispute, "...Costa Rica did not consent to submit to international
arbitration disputes related to investments that have previously been submitted to a competent
national court and have resulted in a decision without the investor having abandoned the
action..."170 In the absence of a withdrawal by SyC (acting through Riteve, a company
controlled by SyC) before the local court issued a judgment, the will of the parties to
exclude the possibility of multiple motions is not respected.!7! The Parties’ consent to
submit a dispute to arbitration is conditioned on not having exhausted the local
administrative or judicial remedies. In the case at hand, Claimant submitted the dispute
to international arbitration without having withdrawn from the local instance before

the court issued its judgment on November 28, 2012.172

In light of the foregoing, Respondent claims that given that Claimant did not withdraw
from the local instance, the conditions under the BIT were not met for Costa Rica’s
consent to submit to international arbitration the investment disputes to be perfected,
given that (i) there was a proceeding before a competent Costa Rican court that referred
to the same dispute that is now the subject of this arbitration, with the same
fundamental basis,1”3 (ii) in both instances, the lawsuits were filed by Claimant,!” (iii)
Claimant failed to take the necessary steps to definitely withdraw from the local

instance, and (iv) the local court already issued judgment. 175

According to Respondent, SyC did not meet the jurisdictional requirement to withdraw
from the controversy that it had previously submitted before a competent national court
prior to the issuance of a judgment, and should not be allowed to hide behind its local

business Riteve to evade the jurisdictional requirements of the BIT, considering that:17

170 Counter-Memorial § 203.
171 Counter-Memorial § 208.

172 Counter-Memorial § 209.

173 Counter-Memorial §§ 215, 226, “both are asking for a decision declaring that Costa Rica has acted against the law,
that it did not adjust Riteve SyC’s rates of, and that the Costa Rican State be condemned to pay a compensation for the
difference between the rate that the Costa Rican State authorized Riteve SyC to charge its users and the adjusted rate that,
according to Riteve SyC, the Costa Rican State should have authorized pursuant to the Contract.”

174 Counter-Memorial §§ 218, 231, “Claimant has used Riteve SyC, a company that it fully controls (for it being its
majority shareholder), as. a means to submit the dispute to a competent national court through the judicial channel.”

175 Counter-Memorial § 211.

1% Rejoinder §§ 34-51.

62

a) SyC does not deny in its Reply the existence of a "Fork in the Road Clause" in
Article X13 of the BIT, nor does SyC dispute the fact that a competent national
court in Costa Rica issued a judgment on November 28, 2012, without SyC

having withdrawn that procedure before the issuance of said judgment.

s

Claimant denies being plaintiff in the lawsuit filed before the local court since
it acted through Riteve, and denies having filed identical breach of contract
claims in both venues, which consist of the request to declare that Costa Rica
did not adjust the rates for VTI service, breaching the Contract and therefore
should be sentenced to pay a compensation to cover the difference between.
the rate that the State authorized Riteve to charge users, and the one that it

should have charged them.

a

SyC did not prove that it was another entity that controlled the local
proceedings, different from the one that controls the current arbitration.
Claimant failed to prove that it was Riteve’s minority shareholder (Transal
S.A.) who had driven Riteve’s acts on the local proceeding, or that said
minority shareholder could block SyC’s decision to withdraw from the local

proceeding.

d

SyC merely highlighted the difference between the names of the claimants in
the registration documents of the local proceeding and the parties named in
this arbitration, failing to observe the complexity of this issue. In this regard,
Costa Rica quotes the case Pantechniki v. Albania to assert that such matters
should be evaluated with discernment. In this regard, Respondent states that
SyC has recognized on several occasions that it effectively controls Riteve

SyC,!77 and therefore it is clear that Riteve is “...a mere vehicle for the

Claimant...” 178

 

Rejoinder § 42, quoting Exhibit C-7.
78 Rejoinder § 42.

 

63

e) SyC’s arguments are inconsistent. On one hand, Claimant argues that it is not
involved in the local proceeding, while at the same time bases its claim of
denial of justice on Resolution 000906-A-04 of October 21, 2004 issued by the
First Chamber of the Supreme Court, which declared the lack of jurisdiction

of the local arbitral tribunal.

f) As to the identity of the subject matter, SyC attempts to deny that in both
proceedings it seeks the same goal: compensation for alleged breaches of
Contract by Costa Rica, related to the adjustment of VTI service's rates,
distinguishing between administrative claims (which in SyC’s view are not
contractual in nature) and claims of breach under the BIT. In this regard,
Costa Rica quotes the Pantechniki v. Albania award, which established that it
is not sufficient to assert that a claim is based on a Treaty to argue it is
different from another claim under local jurisdiction, and instead it must be
determined whether the claim has an independent existence beyond the

Contract, which Costa Rica denies.

g) Respondent considers that SyC’s assertion that in the local trial no economic
compensation was requested is false, since in the November 28, 2012
judgment the Judicial Branch notes that Riteve requested that "... the State be
ordered to pay present and future damages and losses...” and including as loss of
profits “...the amount Riteve failed to earn from July 2002 to December 31, 2005,
due to the difference between the established rate and that it would have earned if the
[PTC] and the [MPWT] had complied with their contractual and constitutional

obligations...” 180

h) SyC is trying to benefit from a formality, considering that on the one hand it
intends to consider Riteve an alter ego of SyC for the purposes of the umbrella

clause, regarding the obligations Costa Rica assumed with Riteve, but on the

179 Rejoinder § 72.
180 Rejoinder §48; quoting Exhibit R-96, pp. 2-3.

64

139.

140.

other hand, and incongruously, SyC intends to deny that relationship with

Riteve with respect to the Fork in the Road Clause.

Allowing SyC to use its local corporation Riteve to evade the jurisdictional
requirements of the BIT would create the possibility of conflicting rulings
between a local court and an international tribunal, which the BIT attempts

to avoid.

As to the obligation SyC had to withdraw its local lawsuit when filing its claim before
ICSID, while SyC argues that the fact that the local court had not yet issued a ruling
exempted SyC from the obligation to withdraw its local suit, Costa Rica claims that it is
precisely in this situation that the Treaty requires the Claimant to withdraw its local
suit in order to bring a claim before an ICSID tribunal. Although SyC argues that "there
are no precedents that have indicated that there is a lack of international jurisdiction because of
the invocation of a clause of this nature",'*! Costa Rica alleges that at least two ICSID
Tribunals dismissed similar cases: Pantechniki v. Albania and Commerce Group v. El

Salvador.

Costa Rica further asserts that the Addendum to the Contract of July 20, 2012 does not
give jurisdiction to ICSID, as stated by SyC for the first time in its Reply. In this regard,

Costa Rica indicates that:1!6?

a) The provision of the Addendum on which SyC relied refers exclusively to the
ICSID Additional Facility, and not to ICSID itself. Thus, Costa Rica
emphasizes that SyC did not submit its claim before the Additional Facility,
nor did it meet the requirements of Article 3.1 of the Arbitration Rules of the

Additional Facility.

181 Post Hearing Brief of Costa Rica § 43; quoting the Transcript, Day 1 (SPA), Opening Allegations of the
Claimant, L. Cuervo, p. 57.
182 Rejoinder §§ 74-75.

65

141.

142.

b)

The Contractual Addendum requires the formation of a "Conciliation
Committee" prior to arbitration, and not having met this requirement,
international arbitration would not be appropriate under the Contractual

Addendum.

The Contractual Addendum states in its arbitration clause that in the case
ICSID’s jurisdiction was questioned, as was the case in this arbitration, the
Parties agreed to submit any dispute to the International Court of Arbitration
of the International Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, under the mentioned

clause SyC would have to withdraw its current complaint before ICSID.

(ii) Position of SyC

Claimant argues that an ICSID tribunal has jurisdiction to hear a dispute brought before

it"... if the facts alleged by the Claimant as they appear in the initial briefs raise the violation of

one or more provisions of the Bilateral Investment Agreement..."'83 According to Claimant,

the facts presented in the Memorial presume violations of the obligations contained in

Articles III and V of the Treaty.

In addition, Claimant contends that the Arbitral Tribunal:

a)

Has jurisdiction ratione personae because SyC is a Spanish corporation, and
had that nationality when submitting its Request for Arbitration before

ICSID.184

Has jurisdiction because of the voluntary agreement between Costa Rica and
SyC. First, Article XI of the Treaty confirms Costa Rica’s consent to submit
any dispute arising from the breach of the Treaty before an arbitral

tribunal.185 Indeed, in the Lanco International Inc. v. Argentine Republic case, the

a

d

tribunal found that signing a treaty in which parties agreed to submit the
disputes to an arbitral tribunal constitutes written expression of consent to
submit such disputes to international arbitration, being "a generic offer for
submission to ICSID arbitration."18° Second, SyC confirmed its consent to
arbitrate by submitting its Request for Arbitration, meeting the requirement
provided in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.1*” Third, the conditions in
the Treaty were met, given that the dispute was notified in writing to Costa
Rica through a Notice of Intent dated May 31, 2011, and six months passed
between that notice and the filing of the Request for Arbitration, in

accordance with Article XI of the Treaty.188

Has jurisdiction ratione temporis, given that the execution of the Contract,
Riteve’s incorporation, the start of operations, and the current dispute took

place during the effective term of the Treaty.18°

Has jurisdiction ratione materiae since the dispute, legal by nature, arises from.
Costa Rica’s infringement of its obligations to promote and protect SyC’s
investment under the Treaty. 1 In this regard, Article III.2 of the Treaty
requires Costa Rica to "...perform any obligation already incurred in connection
with investments by investors..." including investments consisting of “...rights
to economic and trade activities granted under a contract...” as well as contractual

rights to economic benefits.19!

Moreover, SyC states that it has not filed any action against Costa Rica in domestic
courts in relation to Article XI of the Treaty, offering as evidence the notarial
certification that proves that Supervision y Control, S.A. is not involved in any

contentious proceedings before administrative judges in Costa Rica.1%

Concerning the alleged lis pendens, in connection with Costa Rica’s assertion that SyC

submitted that same dispute concerning its investment before a local court and without

taking the necessary steps to permanently withdraw from that judicial instance,!%3 SyC

states that:

a)

s

a

It is not the same claimant, since (i) it is SyC and not Riteve who has the
character of investor; (ii) SyC and Riteve are different corporations; and, (iii)
45% of Riteve’s shares are owned by the Costa Rican corporation Transal S.A.,
who has no interest in this arbitration. Therefore, Claimant states that SyC

has not filed any proceeding in Costa Rica.

It is not the same dispute, since the issue submitted before a local court was
an action for annulment of administrative acts, so it concerned claims related
to annulling, different from the claims for compensation of damages due to
breach of contractual obligations by Costa Rica. In addition, MPWT and
Riteve, in the Addendum to the Contract, expressly renounced to submit any
disputes arising from the Contract or related to it before domestic authorities,

since they would be submitted to international arbitration.1%

There is no proceeding of which SyC can or should desist from. According to
Article XI of the Treaty, for it to be necessary to desist from an action there is
a prior condition that the investor has submitted the dispute to the competent
court of the contracting party, being understood that the only one that can
desist from a proceeding is the one who has the status of party. Given that
SyC was nota party in the administrative-law proceeding filed by Riteve and
that Transal S.A. is not a party in this arbitration, to claim that Riteve should
desist from the action for annulment "...would lead to the absurdity of taking

away from an entity that has no claim in the arbitration process a legitimate claim

that was raised before the judges of its country in regards to the issuance of an
administrative action that it considers null and against the law...” 1% Claimant also
argues that if it abused its majority position in Riteve, it would be liable to
Transal S.A. for leaving it without protection. Therefore, the situation Article

XI of the Treaty is intended to regulate did not occur in the case at hand.197

d) No lis pendens exists, since the necessary requirements are not met, and the
Costa Rican court itself mentioned in the judgment of November 28, 2012 that
(i) the right invoked in this arbitration, based on the Treaty, is not the same
as the one heard in the local trial, and (ii) the claims in each of the two
proceedings are very different in nature; the claim filed before local courts
related to the annulment of public conduct (and incidentally property-
related) while the claim in this arbitration exclusively pertaining to
property.1% SyC also points out that the factual background in Pantechniki SA
Contractors & Engineers v. Albania was different from the current dispute,
given that in both instances the claim was contractual and the same company
that filed a lawsuit before the Albanian courts subsequently notified its claim

under the bilateral investment treaty.1°

e) SyC claims it does not meet the three requirements set forth in the award of
Benvenuti and Bonfant SRL v. The Government of the People's Republic of the
Congo, which are (i) identity of parties, (ii) identity of matter and (iii) identity
of subject.2 In this regard, SyC states that in both the procedure before the
Administrative Contentious Court and the arbitration proceeding before
ICSID there is: (i) no identity of parties; (ii) the matter in the local suit is
different from the matter in the arbitration proceeding; and (iii) there is no
identity in the subject because the local trial was not a contract-related

proceeding and was limited to facts occurring between 2002 and 2005,

compared to the arbitration damages arising from multiple actions of Costa
Rica covering the period 1998-2012 and claiming future damages for period
ending in 2022.20!

f) Moreover, assuming without conceding that SyC had submitted a dispute to
the domestic judges of Costa Rica, Claimant alleges that pursuant to Article
XI of the Treaty, even if the investor previously went before local courts it
may refer the dispute to arbitration “...as long as said national court has not
issued judgment ...”, and both the Request for Arbitration and the memorial

were submitted before a judgment was issued in the local trial.2°

Moreover, SyC also argues that Article XI of the Treaty is not a Fork in the Road Clause
as Costa Rica claims, because the words “may in addition” suggest that it is not a forum
selection clause, but rather a clause that permits international arbitration even when the
investor has attempted to have a local court hear the dispute. SyC insists that when it
presented its Request for Arbitration, the decision of the local proceeding had not yet
been issued; in addition to the fact that such dispute was filed by a different company,

and the claims were different from the claims in this proceeding.”

SyC also states that on July 20, 2012, MPWT and Riteve expressly confirmed that ICSID
jurisdiction existed by signing the Contractual Addendum, which in clause 11.4
provides that any dispute arising with respect to the Contract would be submitted to
international arbitration, and specifically designating ICSID to manage the

arbitration.2

4, REQUIREMENT OF CONSULTATION AND WAITING PERIOD ESTABLISHED IN
ARTICLES XI.1 AND XI.2 OF THE TREATY

(i) Position of Costa Rica

Respondent contends that SyC submitted five new claims in its Memorial that are not
related in any way with the three claims described in its Notice of Intent dated May 31,
2011 and in its Request for Arbitration. In this regard, Costa Rica claims that the terms
of the Treaty do not allow the unilateral expansion of the scope of the dispute.2°> Costa

Rica summarizes these five new claims in the following points:

“(a) argument under Article IIL.1 of the Treaty (denial of justice) based on
Resolution 000906-A-04 of October 21, 2004 of the First Chamber of the Supreme
Court of Justice (Sala Primera de la Corte Suprema de Justicia) of Costa Rica,

declaring the lack of jurisdiction of the local Arbitral Tribunal;

(b) argument under Articles III.1 and III.2 of the Treaty, on the grounds of ‘the

issuance on December 17, 2008, of an amendment to the Traffic Act’;

(c) argument under Articles II.1 and III.2 of the Treaty, on the grounds of ‘the
issuance on October 26, 2012, of a New Traffic Act’;

(d) argument under articles III.1, III.2 and V, on the grounds of ‘having
unilaterally and unfairly terminated the contract of services for vehicular
inspection though Resolution 333 of May 9, 2011, issued by the Minister of Public
Works and Transportation without ordering payment of a prompt and adequate

compensation,”

(e) argument under article III.1 of the Treaty, on the grounds of not having
published a specific methodology before August 10, 2012, after having committed
to do so on July 20, 2012.”206

205 Counter-Memorial § 236.
206 Counter-Memorial § 237.

71

148.

149.

Further, Respondent argues that under Article XI.1 of the Treaty, the dispute must be
"...given in writing, including detailed information, by the investor to the Contracting Party
receiving the investment...", meaning that SyC had to notify Costa Rica of all its claims,
including the five claims previously mentioned, at least six months prior to the
submission of the dispute to arbitration.” However, SyC only met this requirement
regarding “three of the claims it identified in its Memorial,” not for the five new

claims.28

According to Respondent, as in Burlington Resources Inc. v. Ecuador, in which the
Arbitral Tribunal "... found itself not to have jurisdiction to hear the claims that had been
neither notified nor object of the amicable consultation between the parties to the dispute"2%, the
Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction over these five new claims. Consequently, the
Tribunal should decline jurisdiction and dismiss these claims for not having complied

with the requirements of Article XL1 of the Treaty,2"° in light of the following:2!"

a) Costa Rica pointed out in its Counter-Memorial that there are five new claims
presented by SyC in its Memorial that were not related to the three claims
described in Claimant's Notice, and SyC did not demonstrate in its Reply
compliance with the notice requirements in terms of Article X1.1 of the Treaty,
which requires the investor to notify the State of all its claims and with

detailed information.

b) SyC in its Reply does not answer the allegation made by Respondent and
instead states that SyC effectively notified the State of the existence of a
dispute under the Treaty. Even though SyC’s notification to the State is

uncontested, the Claimant never proved that it had notified Costa Rica in the

manner required by the Treaty, with detailed information on each of the

dispute issues, with respect to these five new claims.

Finally, Costa Rica indicates that SyC has requested measures that the Arbitral Tribunal
is not authorized to take, which are therefore invalid and must be rejected outright.

Respondent summarizes those measures as follows:2!2

“... [First], it demands that the Tribunal exercise jurisdiction regardless of the
non-compliance by the Claimant with the express conditions of consent to the
arbitration jurisdiction that the Contracting States of the Treaty expressly agreed
to in the Treaty. Secondly, the Claimant invites the Tribunal to ignore the high
threshold of the international standards under which it presents its claims and to
act as an ex aequo et bono court- which the tribunal is not empowered to do, as
there has been no consent from both Parties for this, as required by Article 42(3)
of the ICSID Convention. Third, it requests that the Tribunal examine and revoke
the conclusions of fact and even of Costa Rican law which competent Costa Rican
courts have reached. At the request of the Claimant itself and its subsidiary and
alter ego, Riteve SyC, [Costa Rican] courts have already considered and issued a
conclusive ruling, with the effects of res judicata, with respect to exactly the same
controversy that the Claimant now seeks to submit to ICSID. Fourth, it requests
the Tribunal to condemn Costa Rica to pay a spectacular indemnification for
totally illusory damages, without having demonstrated a single cent in material

losses and much less the multi-million amount in damages it claims...”

 

Position of SyC

In the case of the alleged failure to comply with the Consultation Period, SyC argues
that the issue of the consultation period has been studied by other international arbitral
tribunals as procedural and not mandatory and jurisdictional, as in the case SGS Société

Géneralé de Surveillance SA v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, in which the tribunal held that

212 Post Hearing Brief of Costa Rica § 6.

73

152.

153.

154.

"compliance with such a requirement is, accordingly not seen as amounting to a condition

precedent for the vesting of jurisdiction ...”75

Also, SyC alleges that there are clear differences between this case and Burlington
Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador cited by Costa Rica, both in the wording of the treaty

and on the facts of the dispute.

Indeed, in Burlington the first communication to Ecuador was made by a company
different from the claimant, without reference to a breach of the treaty in question. Thus,
Ecuador claimed that it was never notified of the existence of a dispute and did not
know about it until the request for arbitration, leaving Ecuador without the opportunity
to settle the dispute before said request. Unlike in Burlington, SyC notified Costa Rica
of the existence of an investment dispute under Article XI.1 of the Treaty through the

Notice of Intent dated May 31, 2011.

Murphy Exploration and Production v. Republic of Ecuador, also cited by Costa Rica, dealt
with a dispute concerning the same bilateral treaty between the United States and
Ecuador. Claimant alleges Respondent overlooked significant differences between the
case cited and the case at hand, such as the facts of the case and the requirements for
submission to arbitration. Unlike in Murphy, where Ecuador alleged that Murphy
notified its claim only days before submitting its request for arbitration, in the case at
hand more than six months passed between the time the Notice of Intent was notified

and the date on which the Request for Arbitration was submitted.2!4

B. QUESTIONS OF MERITS

1. FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT
1.1 Stability

(i) Position of SyC

Claimant argues that the stability of the legal system is an essential element of fair and
equitable treatment. Therefore the right to obtain at any time fair and equitable
treatment is violated when measures taken by a State substantially alter the legal and
business environment in relation to which an investment was decided and carried out,

producing a loss of business certainty and stability.?!5

Claimant asserts that the government infringes on the international obligation to honor
the fulfillment of contractual obligations when its decisions interfere significantly with
the investor’s rights, or when the conduct that infringes an undertaken obligation

comes from a State’s sovereign power or function.

In that sense, SyC argues Costa Rica breached its obligations under the Treaty when it
enacted significant legal and regulatory changes that resulted in a change of the policy
that was considered in the Contract. This was not an ordinary contractual breach of a

commercial nature, which would not be deemed a breach under the Treaty.26

(ii) Position of Costa Rica

Respondent claims that not just any error in the State's conduct constitutes a violation
of its obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment.2!7 Respondent states that the

stability of the legal system cannot be interpreted as an essential element of fair and

equitable treatment, and the fair and equitable treatment cannot be interpreted as
inseparable from stability and predictability.’ According to Respondent, Claimant
extrapolates the conclusions in the CMS, LG&E, and Sempra cases against Argentina
concluding that "the stability of the legal system is an essential element of fair and equitable
treatment." However, said cases differ from the Treaty in that the Bilateral Investment
Treaty between Argentina and the United States of America had among its objectives
of fair and equitable treatment the legal system’s stability.2!9 In this regard, Respondent

argues the following:

“.,.Claimant cannot extrapolate the conclusion of the three awards in CMS,
LG&E and Sempra, in the sense that ‘the stability of the legal system is an essential
element of fair and equitable treatment’ and intend to apply the same conclusion
to the present case, because the terms of this Agreement are significantly and
materially different from the terms of the agreement between Argentina and the

United States.”220

1.2 Legitimate Expectations
(i) Position of SyC

Claimant asserts that the State’s failure to comply with the investor's legitimate
expectations, those that induced him to make the investment, constitutes a violation of
the obligation to give the investor at all times fair and equitable treatment. For this
reason, the analysis of fair and equitable treatment involves the necessary consideration
of investor expectations when investing, relying on the protections provided by the host
State. SyC also states that the obligation of fair and equitable treatment is violated if the

State's conduct is characterized as arbitrary.”2!

160. In light of the foregoing, Claimant alleges that Costa Rica violated its obligation to
provide SyC’s investment fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security

by:222

a

Preventing that the contractually agreed arbitration mechanism could be

processed through a Resolution of the Supreme Court.

s

Repeatedly breaching its obligations in an unfair and discriminatory manner
by failing to respect the rates submitted by the contractor in its offer, failing
to approve the methodology for rate readjustment, failing to publish, and

rejecting various requests for rate readjustment for more than seven years.

a

Breaching contractual obligations by repealing decrees and approving
amendments to traffic laws, in the exercise of the State’s exclusive powers,

that eliminated already granted rights to SyC.

d

Abstaining from readjusting the applicable rates and ending the exclusive

rights granted under the Contract.

161. SyC argues that the principle of “service at cost” invoked by Costa Rica should not be

applied to the Contract because:223

a) Said principle is expressed in Article 5 of Law 7593 of 1995 (amended by Law
No. 8660 of August 8, 2008), which does not mention the VTI service. Also,
for a public service to be understood as regulated and under the regulatory
authority "... it is indispensable to have an express statement by the law ..."" The
relevant regulatory authority in this case, the PSRA, does not include the VTI

service in its list of public services regulated.2%

According to Carlos Arguedas’ report, there is no reference to the Contract
being subject to the principle of service at cost in any official notice from the

Comptroller, nor was this mentioned during the tender proceeding.”

The same PSRA expert used by Costa Rica reaches the conclusion that in view
of the rate regulation established in the Contract, the PSRA cannot apply to
the Contract the same regulation that it applies to the rest of the services it
regulates, from which SyC infers that the rules of the Law 7593, which is

where the principle of service at cost is found, do not apply to the Contract.”6

The regulation is a limitation on the free market and on free enterprise, and
therefore “...if must be enshrined expressly and cannot be applied by analogy or

extension ...”227

Because VTI is not a public service, the principle of service at cost should not
apply. SyC cites several official rulings of the PSRA and the Attorney General

in which they postulated that the VTI service is not a public service.

The contract did not provide specific provisions regarding public services
regulation, establishing that everything related to VTI corresponded to the

PTC, the contracting entity.

PSRA’s rejection of the readjustment requests confirms that VTI service is not

a public service subject to its regulation.

According to SyC the Contract does not limit the profitability and in this respect points

out that:228

The Contract does not limit the profitability of the company, and if so, Costa
Rica has the burden of proof to establish a contractual limitation to that

profitability, given that it is the Respondent who claims the above.

According to Mr. Carlos Arguedas’ report, the Comptroller did not mention
limitations to profitability in the framework of the implementation of the
adjustment mechanisms provided in the Contract, in any of its

pronouncements.”

The methodology for the rate readjustment in the Contract provides that all
costs and expenses must be taken into account, but nothing is mentioned

regarding the issue of profitability.

The Terms of the Tender do not mention anything regarding a possible

limitation of the contractor's profitability.2°

None of the methodologies referred to for the rate readjustment implies said
limitation on profitability, including (i) the methodology in Executive Order
30185; (ii) the methodology from the Carvajal Firm; (iii) the October 21, 2003
formula; and (iv) the methodology used by Mr. Brunner and Mr. Vargas in
2002.

163. In connection with Costa Rica’s statement that the Consortium submitted in its Offer a

rate of return of 13.28%, SyC counters that this statement is false”! for two reasons: (i)

there was never a complementary offering, and (ii) the document Costa Rica claims as

a supposed original complementary offer to the Consortium’s July 7, 1998 Bid does not

correspond to what was announced since it is"... a document that was informally provided

in the meetings held in the [Comptroller General Office] after it notified the government of its

decision to not endorse the contract.”32_ Furthermore, clause 1.2 of the Contract sets forth

the documents that govern it (the Terms of the Tender and the bid of the contractor),

without mentioning any supplement to the offer.

164. In relation to the source of its expectations, SyC states that:2%

a) Said expectations arise from (i) the Terms of the Tender; (ii) the offer; (iii) the
award of the Tender; and (iv) the Contract, countersigned by the

Comptroller's Office.

b) The content of the official notices from the Comptroller cannot produce the
effects intended by Costa Rica, since (i) they are internal acts of the State,
between the Comptroller and the MPWT, without the Consortium being
notified of such documents; (ii) it is questionable whether the constitutional
countersignature was appropriate, given that the Contract does not provide
for public funds payment; and (iii) even if the countersignature was
appropriate, the Comptroller's prerogative is whether to validate a Contract,

not to modify its contents.

c) SyC does not seek the enforcement of the provisions of the First Contract,
which has no binding effect, but requests the enforcement of the obligations
clearly stipulated in the Contract, which had the Comptroller's

countersignature.

165. Regarding the increased costs, evidenced by the budget for the admissibility of rates

adjustment, SyC contends that:234

a) Costa Rica’s own expert, Timothy Hart, asserts that in the two times Costa
Rica readjusted rates in 2002 and 2005, such adjustments were due to Riteve’s

rising costs.

167.

168.

b) The Contract, defining what is meant by rate adjustment, states that it would
include both costs increase and the necessary adjustments based on economic

indicators. 236

c) According to Nicholas Good’s report, Riteve’s labor costs have increased in
direct proportion to inflation, stating that since 2003 operating costs have

increased by 148%.

SyC states that the document identified as R-6, contrary to the claims of Costa Rica, was
not part of the offer. It was confirmed at the Hearing that according to the declaration
of Amador Castro, said document, where a return of 13.28% was expressed, not only
was it not part of the offer, but was presented two years after its date, when the Contract
had already been awarded. Moreover, it would not have made sense to accept a return
of 13.28% considering that at the time the bank interest in Costa Rica was approximately
20%. Claimant also asserts that this reference was not about profit expectations, but was

simply a fixed factor to apply the Comptroller's formula.””

SyC states that the Comptroller never ruled on the contents of Executive Order 30185
since the Comptroller’s Countersignature Official Notice had been issued six months
before the Executive Order. Thus, the government could not refer to such notice to base
its decision to revoke. Consequently, SyC argues that the executive order was not
revoked for being against the law, but as a political decision, namely that the MPWT

wanted to lower the initial applicable rates.8

Likewise, SyC asserts that the minutes of the PTC session held on November 11, 200329
show that the Comptroller opposed the formula applied by Mr. Vargas and Mr.
Brunner. However, SyC considers that having lowered the rates, the opinion of the

Comptroller was not considered binding.

169. Claimant alleges that the Carvajal Firm report "...proves that 13% has nothing to do with
a possible ceiling or limit on profitability but is only a factor within the adjustment formutla..."241
SyC also argues that the profitability was not limited, considering that in 2004, when
the only approved rate adjustment was made, the profit before taxes was 22.35% and
the net profit was 14.47%. Therefore, if the reference to 13% is understood as a limit to

profitability, the adjustment would not have been appropriate.22

(ii) Position of Costa Rica

170. Based on the opinion of various arbitral tribunals,2*3 Respondent argues that there are
three requirements in order for the investor’s expectations to be protected under the
independent standard of fair and equitable treatment: first, “...they have to be legitimate
and reasonable; second, they must be based on conditions offered or commitments assumed by
the State; and third, they have to have been taken into account by the investor when deciding
whether or not to make the investment.” 244 Considering the above, and based on LG&E v.
Argentina, the only investor's expectations subject to protection are the ones based on
the terms offered by the receiving State at the time of investment, must have real
existence, and be legally enforceable. The investor cannot unilaterally establish

expectations.”4

On the legal nature of the Contract, Costa Rica claims that the State owns and has the
rights to the VTI service, because it is a public service that cannot be lost, even if the
service is delegated to an individual.” The consideration received for the service is
therefore subject to the limits imposed by Costa Rican law, such as the principle of
"service at cost" that the PSRA Act defines as the principle that "...determines the pricing
method and the prices of public services, in such a way that only the costs necessary to provide
the service are contemplated, which will allow a competitive retribution and ensure the

appropriate development of the activity..."247

Costa Rica claims that (i) the Attorney General has highlighted, before the start of
operations, that the actual costs and expenses incurred by the contractor must be
included in the methodology for rate readjustment;8 (ii) the Contract provides in
Clause 9.1 that the principle of service at cost is one of the guiding principles of the tariff
system;? and (iii) several authorities, among them the Comptroller, the Attorney
General, and the Supreme Court, have confirmed that the Contract is governed by that

principle.25°

On the other hand, Costa Rica invokes the principle of "economic and financial balance"
arguing that this is another guiding principle of the Contract under Clause 9.1, which
states that the Contract has as a "...fundamental principle the maintenance of the economic
and financial balance of the agreement..." defining such concept in its clause 1.1 as the
“...economic and financial situation with which the execution of the contract begins, to which
the contractor is entitled in the event of increases in its costs that modify the originally agreed
conditions, including the reasonable recovery of its investments or earnings...”%! The
Executive Order 30987, which established the procedure for rate readjustment states
that the purpose of the rate adjustments is the "... intention of guaranteeing the economic

and financial balance of the agreement, in accordance with the evaluation of properly verified

real costs that are necessary for the execution of the agreement...”,52 even providing in
Article 7 that when applying for an adjustment it is necessary to submit the economic
financial study that proves the cost modification. In this regard, Costa Rica claims that
(i) SyC has failed to prove in the local trial or in its Memorial that the referred economic
financial balance of the Contract has been affected;23 and (ii) Riteve’s audited financial
statements show that the economic financial balance of the Contract has not been

affected, but rather that it has been maintained since the beginning of the Concession.24

Costa Rica states that SyC’s expectation that the contract would be automatically
extended — without any State’s discretion—was not legitimate, per the Comptroller's
official notices to SyC before it made the investment. Respondent claims that in those
official notices, the Comptroller stated that the Contract did not grant an automatic

right to extend the Contract, "... rather conferred discretion on the [MPWT]...”255

As for SyC’s argument that the Comptroller General’s Countersignature Official Notice
supposedly confirms the right of the Consortium to a rate readjustment ordinarily once
a year, Respondent rejects this argument claiming that the Comptroller was clear in
establishing that any rate adjustment, both ordinary and extraordinary, would be made
only when the Consortium could prove an imbalance of the economic and financial

equation of the Contract capable of justifying the rate increase requested.26

With regard to SyC’s legitimate expectations,” Costa Rica claims that (i) SyC did not
refute any of the three requirements listed in the Counter-Memorial;8 (ii) SyC did not
identify the facts on which its claims with respect to those expectations are based,

referring to the concept without specifying a factual basis; (iii) contradictorily, in its

Reply, SyC identifies the countersigned Contract as a source of legitimate expectations,
while questioning the value of the Comptroller’s Non-Countersignature Official Notice
and Countersignature Official Notice; and (iv) SyC could not have a legitimate
expectation of automatic rate adjustments, since both the Non-Countersignature
Official Notice and the Countersignature Official Notice determined the unlawfulness

of such automatic adjustments prior to Claimant's investment.

Regarding the efforts of Costa Rica to develop and implement a methodology for rate
readjustment, Respondent restates that even under the self-standing standard of fair
and equitable treatment, as insufficient as SyC considers Costa Rica's efforts, these do

not fall under any of the necessary characteristics.

Although SyC’s argues that the VTI service is not a public service because it is not listed
as a public service in Article 5 of the 7593 Act or PSRA Act, and therefore the VTI service
should not be governed by the principle of service at cost, Costa Rica contends that the
list referred to is not exhaustive, concluding that it does not mean that the VTI service
is not a public service simply because it is not included in that article. Respondent cites
examples of services that were not included in the aforementioned article that have
been recognized and treated as public services, based on the expert opinion of Aldo

Milano and on the statements of the Attorney General's Office.26

Regarding the Legal Opinion 103-J-2003 issued by the Attorney General on June 30,
2003, document in which SyC supports its position on the nature of the VTI service,
Respondent claims it is not legally binding, being merely a legal opinion requested by
the Legislative Assembly but not by a governmental entity.2°! Additionally, the case
law of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court has repeatedly noted VTI to

be a public service, becoming a binding criterion? that has been confirmed by the

Attorney General's Office in an opinion subsequent to the one cited by SyC23 -

consistent with Contract clause 2.3, which identifies the VTI service as a public service.

On the other hand, Costa Rica argues that SyC accuses Respondent of "...distort[ing] the
facts...”264 since Costa Rica provided in its Counter-Memorial proof that showed that
the Consortium projected that it would get an internal rate of return of 13.28% and an
annual growth of 7% in initial inspections for the VTI service between 1998 and 2008;
the internal rate of return being, "... an element that reflects contractual balance at the
beginning of the concession, at least in relation to the contractor. This element in turn is used
as a point of reference to later determine whether a rate adjustment is in line or not ...”265
However, Costa Rica states that Claimant contradicts itself, since after accusing Costa
Rica of fabricating said document, it asserts that, "...the document that Costa Rica now
intends to utilize and falsely state was part of the bid, was a document that was informally
provided in the meetings held in the CGR after it notified the government of its decision to not
endorse the contract..."26° These projections, reflecting at the time an internal rate of return
of 13.28%, were confirmed by Claimant's witness, José Luis Lopez, Chairman of Riteve,
who also confirmed the delivery of said projections to the Comptroller on April 26,

2001.267

According to Respondent, this proves that at the time of signing the Contract, the
Consortium did not expect to get "... an internal rate of return of more than 20% [o]r even
35% for providing that service. That is ultimately a profitability that is vastly superior to what
the company projected before it began operations.” 28 SyC did not refute in its Reply having
obtained a return of 644% (21.6% annually) on its capital contribution, between
September 30, 2001 and December 31, 2011.2 Therefore, Costa Rica claims that not only
has SyC not established a financial economic imbalance of the Contract to its detriment,

but it also failed to refute that the Consortium’s profits were much higher than

originally projected. Thus, if there is an imbalance it is in detriment of the State, not of

the contractor.?”

182. Costa Rica argues that, as in the case of Iberdrola v. Guatemala, SyC’s claims must be
dismissed on the ground that it has not carried its burden of proof of specifically
identifying which acts or omissions by Costa Rica constituted breaches of specific

provisions of the Treaty.27!

1.3 Arbitrariness and Discrimination

(i) Position of SyC

183. The arguments of the Claimant in this respect refer to the fact that Costa Rica:

a

Issued the Executive Order 30573-MPWT, three days before the start of
operations, repealing the Executive Orders that had established the
methodology for rate readjustment and the rates applicable for the first year

of operations.

s

Issued Ruling 333, unilaterally terminating the Contract, making the decision

not to extend the Contract for political reasons.

a

Approved reforms to Transit Laws that abolished the exclusivity rights

granted to Riteve under the Contract.

d) Breached its obligation to publish the methodology agreed under the
agreement of July 20, 2012.272

184. With regard to the constitutional and legal powers of the Comptroller and its

limitations, SyC states the following:?”

a)

a

d)

 

The Comptroller’s memorandums regarding the countersignature were not
directed to the Consortium, but only to the Deputy Chairman of PTC.
Therefore, the Consortium never knew the Comptroller's position, situation

it expressed in the letter of July 5, 2002 addressed to the MPWT.24

The statements of the Comptroller were known by the MPWT more than
eight months before the publication of the Executive Order 30185, and
therefore invoking those statements to repeal said Executive Order is

arbitrary and unfair.

The purpose of the Comptroller’s powers, provided in Article 11 of its
Organic Law (hereinafter, the “Organic Law”) is to '"...ensure the legality and
effectiveness of internal controls and management of public funds in entities over
which it has jurisdiction..." Likewise, the Constitution of Costa Rica states in
Article 184 that the main faculty of the Comptroller is the supervision and
scrutiny of the public treasury, which is constituted by public funds. In this
regard, the Contract (i) does not provide for payment of the rates with public
funds; (ii) does not provide for administration of public funds by the

contractor; and, (iii) does not require the Comptroller’s countersignature.

The Comptroller has no power to co-manage, modify or exercise powers
corresponding to the administration of the Contract. The Constitutional
Chamber analyzing whether the Comptroller could or not intervene in the
issue of price adjustments, expressed through vote 6432-98 that “It is not
constitutionally possible that the proper Comptroller defines what, how and when

payment by concept of readjustment is made, and that it’s this institution which

elaborate formulas and publish general opinions corresponding to the active
administration”,2”6 as Ms. Laura Rivera mentions in her witness statement.
SyC also states that the Comptroller acknowledged that it did not have the
authority to establish rates, because that power was reserved for the

Administration.27”

The Comptroller has the authority to intervene in the tender proceedings,
authority it used in this case, and if it found that the Terms of the Tender
(particularly on the issue of rates) were contrary to Costa Rican law it could
have intervened to ensure the tender was not awarded and declared void,
but it did not. SyC alleges that by intervening in this case, the Comptroller
"...was able to exercise its constitutional and legal powers in this case, it intervened
and it concluded that the basis of the tender presented a problem because it did not
establish an automatic system for adjustment.”278 Likewise, SyC quotes the
Comptroller’s Ruling 231 of 1999, deciding the appeals filed by other tender
participants, which provides that "...the main conclusion of the [Comptroller
General] was [that] the notice is simply disregarded when referring to the mechanism
but it is clear that the periodicity is annual and the initiative provenes from the
concessionaire."279 Also, SyC quotes the Comptroller’s Ruling 120-2000 of
March 30, 2000, which concludes that “With respect to the accurate rates, the
tender rules themselves establish mechanisms and procedures for its establishment
and adjustments as shown on pages 103 and 156...”°80 Said pages provide that
"The rates will be adjusted annually according to studies conducted by the contractor
duly approved by the MPWT" and that “The offered rate values for each of the
services will be reviewed annually according to a study conducted by the contractor
and approved by the MPWT and the entity responsible for approving those tariffs in

order to avoid damaging the economic and financial balance of the successful

bidder.”281_ SyC considers it arbitrary and unfair that the Comptroller first
issued an opinion without finding any defect, and later changed its criterion

and abused its powers when it is doubtful that it had the authority.

185. Furthermore, regarding the countersignature by the Comptroller, SyC states that:

a) The countersignature may be required, according to the Constitution, only
when a payment from public funds is contemplated since the controlling,
auditing, and monitoring functions conferred to the Comptroller General
refer exclusively to public funds in accordance with the opinion of the expert
Ruben Hernandez. Therefore, the Administration had no obligation to seek

such countersignature in this case.

s

Clause 12.5 of the Contract conditions the Comptroller’s countersignature to

approve an amendment "

 

so required by law...", but it does not provide that

 

any amendment to the Contract requires the Comptroller's

countersignature.?84

In conclusion, the Comptroller’s countersignature of the Contract confirms

Re

its content conformed to the existing law. However, in determining the rights
and obligations of the Parties, what governs is what the parties expressly

agreed upon and established in the Contract.285
186. Inrelation to the provisions of the Comptroller’s pronouncements, SyC states that:286

a) The Comptroller’s Non-Countersignature Official Notice dated May 3, 2001,
through which the countersignature of the First Contract was denied, was

based on the opposition to apply its own formula previously published on

December 2, 1982, because said mechanism was not intended for public
services provided by the private sector on behalf of the State. SyC also alleges
that in said official notice the use of indexes to calculate the rate readjustment
was not objected to, and that by arguing that said readjustment is not limited
to the changes in the indexes used “...the [Comptroller] acknowledges that part
of the work that corresponds to the [PTC], as the entity responsible to set the tariff
and regulate the service, consists of verifying the changes in the sources of the indexes
utilized and the correct application of the mathematical formula in algebraic
terms” 87 and that the Comptroller’s Office accepted that it should produce
an ordinary rate adjustment every year, which it subsequently confirmed in
its official notice dated June 28, 2001. On the other hand, SyC mentions that
in the official notice dated May 3, 2001 the Comptroller’s Office recognized
that the PTC should verify the changes in the sources of the indexes used and
the rightful application of the mathematical formula in algebraic terms, for
which SyC asserts that "Ifan important part of the [Comptroller's] duties functions
(sic) is to verify the compliance of the Government's obligations, and if the
endorsement had the importance that Costa Rica intends, it is not understandable for
the [Comptroller Office] to not have done anything to verify that the [Comptroller]
complied with the obligations mentioned by [the Comptroller] in its official

memorandum. ”288

SyC invokes the constitutional right to property intangibility as a source of

the right to readjust rates, and in this regard states that:28°

i. The right to economic and financial balance is part of and derives from
the right to property intangibility protected in Article 45 of the
Constitution of Costa Rica, and in accordance with the decisions of the

Constitutional Chamber, price adjustments in order to keep the

originally agreed economic level intact are part of the right to property

intangibility.

ii. Price adjustments are a right of the contractor and an obligation (not a
power) of the State in any contract entered into with it, according to

various precedents of the Constitutional Chamber.

iii. SyC asserts, based on Article 31 of the Administrative Contracting
Law, that the price adjustments are not contractual. Instead, SyC
claims that in any contract with the State price adjustment is
recognized as a right that is granted at the moment the offer is
submitted. According to Claimant the purpose is to obtain
compensation for the higher costs incurred in implementing the
agreed subject of the Contract; assertion that SyC supports in the
Judgments 785-90 and 1801-90 issued by the Constitutional Chamber.

iv. The Constitutional Chamber has explained that price adjustments are
made "... through the application of mathematical equations based on the

official price and cost indices prepared by the Executive Power.” 2

c) The economic and financial balance in Costa Rica is a constitutional right of
the contractor to rate readjustment. The expert opinion of Timothy Hart is
wrong because it considers it a balance of the contract and applies "... factors

designed by him ...”291

d

Profitability is not a factor in the calculation of the adjustments, and the need
to limit profitability is not envisaged, either in the Contract or in the laws that
govern it. The only scenario for the admissibility of adjustments are those

agreed by the Parties, i.e. increases in costs or changes in economic indicators.

e) The Comptroller General referred to the financial balance as a right of the

contractor to respect what was agreed to contractually.”

187. Inits Reply, SyC also stated that in its Counter-Memorial, Costa Rica acknowledged the
following facts presented by SyC:293

a) The State’s failure to fulfill its obligation to annually readjust the rate
applicable to the VTI service. Between July 2002 and July 2012, two
readjustments were made out of ten that should have been implemented,
because the PTC has not issued a methodology for said readjustment, despite

being one of its obligations according to the Contract.

b) The government unilaterally revoked Executive Orders 30185 and 30396,
even though Executive Order 30185 was issued and published by the MPWT
nine months after the Comptroller’s official notices in which the decision to
revoke them is allegedly based on. According to SyC this confirms that "...

political motives were determinant ...” 24

a

That the First Chamber of the Supreme Court prevented the arbitral
mechanism agreed in the Contract from operating, even though (i) said
mechanism was provided for in the Contract; (ii) it was also provided for in
each one of the drafts of the Contract; and (iii) the report in which the Legal
Affairs Director of the PTC concluded that the rate issue could not be the
subject of an arbitral tribunal's decision was issued three years after the

Contract was signed.

to rates for the VTI service, even though that faculty belongs to the PTC under
the Contract. Similarly, through Ruling 333 Costa Rica decided not to extend
the Contract in order to expand the market to several operators, and if that
ruling was later overturned it was not to respect the contractor's rights but to

ensure the continued provision of the VTI service.

e) Costa Rica issued a Transit Law on October 26, 2012 that ended the

exclusivity awarded by contract to SyC.

f) Costa Rica failed to comply with its obligation to adopt and publish the

methodology for rate readjustment during the first ten years of the Contract.

g) The MPWT signed a Direct Agreement under which it was bound to publish

a methodology for rate readjustment.

188. In relation to the obligation to provide foreign investors fair and equitable treatment,

SyC stated that:

a) The Treaty provides that fair and equitable treatment in no case may be less
favorable than what is required by international law. Costa Rica is part of the
Free Trade Agreement among the Dominican Republic, Central America and
the United States, which provides a comprehensive mechanism for the
protection of foreign investment under the obligation to give fair and
equitable treatment. In this regard, SyC argues that the obligation of fair and
equitable treatment must be interpreted in light of this treaty, in case it is

found to be more favorable.2%

b) Costa Rica repeatedly argues in its Counter-Memorial that the power to
establish the rates for VTI and the methodology for their adjustment is a
power of imperium, and therefore only the government of Costa Rica could

issue said methodology and establish the rates. Although Riteve submitted

equitable, to take into account the following facts:27

iii.

SyC submitted various rates with its Offer in 1998, whose values
should have been updated to the equivalent figures when signing the
Contract in 2001.

The PTC, the appointed authority responsible for approving and
publishing the methodology for rate readjustment, did not fulfill its

obligations.

Despite having twice reached an agreement on the methodology
applicable to rate readjustment (the first in the Contract and reflected
in Executive Order 30185, the second through the Direct Agreement of
July 2012), the government of Costa Rica did not comply with the
obligations undertaken and ignored the decisions it reached in those

agreements.

Costa Rica invokes in its defense the actions of agencies that are not

involved in the Contract, such as the Comptroller.
The Treaty in its preamble mentions the importance of creating

favorable conditions for investment, and mentions the importance of

enhancing economic cooperation between the two countries.2°8

Regarding the award of Suez Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA
and Vivendi Universal SA v. Argentine Republic, Claimant argues that the
purpose of economic cooperation reaffirms and reinforces the
importance of fair and equitable treatment in the structure of the treaty

created by the contracting parties.2°

When citing the award issued in Enron Corporation Ponderosa Assets v.
Republic of Argentina, Costa Rica omitted that the tribunal concludes
that a stable legal system for investment is an essential element of fair
and equitable treatment, that the protection of the investor's
expectations when making the investment is an aspect of the standard,
and that these expectations derived from conditions offered by the
State to the investor at the time of investment, defining those
expectations as those based on the conditions offered by the State at
the time of the investment, which cannot be established unilaterally by
one party, and that in said case the source of such legitimate
expectations was the contract and the law applicable to it, conclusions

which could be reached in this case.3

Costa Rica seeks to limit the profitability of SyC, without having any
express provision in the Contract or permitted by law, which is

contrary to the conditions necessary to promote investment.3!

All the facts recognized by Costa Rica constitute arbitrary measures

contrary to foreign investment.22

Claimant states that in order to determine whether the State breached its obligation not
to take discriminatory measures pursuant to Article III.2 of the Treaty, the State’s action

must be analyzed for reasonableness, in the sense that it follows a rational policy.3%

Also, SyC argues that the fair and equitable treatment to which Costa Rica was bound
allowed Claimant to expect Respondent not to act in a contradictory manner, that is,
"...without reversing decisions arbitrarily or previous or existing approvals issued by the State
in which the investor relied and based the assumption of commitments and the planning and

implementation of economic and commercial operation ...” 34

In light of the foregoing, SyC argues that Costa Rica has breached its obligation not to
obstruct in any way by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the enjoyment of its
investment, established under Article III.2 of the Treaty.>°

Claimant's allegations in this regard are that Costa Rica:

a) Clause 4 of the Contract provides the agreements on extensions, which state
that the decision not to extend was only considered a "...possible decision..."
Consequently, SyC could expect the extension with only a possibility of non-
extension in which case the decision should be based on a technical report
communicated to Riteve six months prior to the date of extension. However,
said report was never prepared, and the MPWT based its decision not to
extend the contract on its intention to award the VTI service to a larger

number of bidders.

b) If said decision was reversed, it was not to honor the obligations contracted
with the Consortium, but in order to ensure continuity in the provision of

VTI service.

(ii) Position of Costa Rica

Referring to arbitrary and discriminatory measures, Costa Rica agrees that the standard
of fair and equitable treatment requires the State not to act in a discriminatory and
arbitrary manner regarding the treatment given to foreign investors and their
investments. In the case of several treaties, including the Treaty, there is a provision
that expressly prohibits arbitrary and discriminatory measures. Therefore, Respondent
claims that proving that none of the government actions that Claimant identifies are
arbitrary or discriminatory under Article III.2 of the Treaty also implies the refutation
of Claimant's allegations of arbitrariness and discrimination under the obligation to
give fair and equitable treatment provided in Article III.1 of the Treaty. Citing the
case of Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, LP v. Argentine Republic, Costa Rica claims
that for a State's conduct to be considered an arbitrary and discriminatory measure, it
must rise to the level of severity of being manifestly improper, and there must be a
capricious, unreasonable or absurd differentiation in comparison to other entities or

sectors.310

195.

Thus, Costa Rica claims that SyC did not meet its burden of proof to demonstrate that

the acts and omissions of the State referred to in the Claimant’s Memorial are in

violation of the obligation to give fair and equitable treatment in line with the minimum

standard of treatment, either under international law or under the autonomous

standard of protection.3"! Costa Rica points out the following:

a) On the subject of SyC’s expectations (the annual rate adjustments for the VTI

service, the automatic extension of the Contract in case of the absence of a
“technical breach report” and the exclusive right to provide the VTI service),
Claimant does not meet the requirements established by case-law to be

considered legitimate.3!2

SyC’s expectation that the Contract and the legal system granted it the right

to automatic and annual rate increases is not legitimate, given that:

Before investing, the Comptroller explained to Claimant that "...a rate
adjustment methodology based on general indexes, which as a result gave
automatic adjustments, would be improper because it is opposite to Costa
Rican law.”"3 Moreover, expectations that are contrary to the law or
the Contract cannot be considered legitimate; consequently, the First
Contract did not get the Comptroller’s countersignature and therefore
never had legal force under the Costa Rican legal system, since
"...automatic rate readjustment was not in conformity with the economic and
financial balance of the Agreement and, also, that it undermined the
supervision power of the [PTC], which would remain limited only to
‘verifying’ the increases that would take place, without having the possibility
of conducting the technical studies necessary to determine if such increases

were actually justified...”°!4 Therefore, SyC knew that rate adjustments

313 Counter-Memorial § 290.
314 Counter-Memorial § 293; Exhibit R-5, p. 6.

99

could not depend ona formula based on overall indexes that result in

automatic increases.*5

ii. The Comptroller countersigned the Contract precisely because the rate
adjustment clause had been amended, eliminating any reference to
automaticity and general indexes included in the First Contract.!6
Therefore, the rate adjustment clause in the final version of the
Contract does not contemplate a formula based on general indexes

that produces automatic increases.

c) Regarding the alleged lack of approval and publication of the methodology
for rate readjustment, Costa Rica claims that several methodologies for rate
readjustment were approved, also approving the respective increases under
the current methodology. Although some of them were later invalidated
because they were not in line with the Contract, in the cases that were in line
with the Contract, both the methodology and the increase were opposed by
Riteve through various actions.*!” Additionally, any error by the PTC in its
attempts to adopt and implement a methodology for rate adjustment is not
an infringement of the minimum standard of treatment under customary

international law invoked by the Claimant.*18

d

Regarding the Claimant's requests to readjust rates, Costa Rica argues that (i)
SyC did not prove that Costa Rica had not approve them having the
contractual obligation to do so;3!9 (ii) SyC did not prove that the failure to
authorize increases constitutes a violation of the obligation to provide fair
and equitable treatment under the Treaty; (iii) SyC was not entitled to
readjustment, given that readjustments are not automatic, but "...must be

authorized only when there has been a consequence on the ‘economic and financial

balance’ of the Agreement; that is to say, when there have been ‘substantial changes
in costs’ that affect the conditions originally agreed, ‘including the reasonable
recovery of the investments or the earnings’ on the part of the contractor...”°2° Also,
Costa Rica states that "... neither in the ordinary proceedings, nor in this
international arbitration, has the Claimant been able to demonstrate the existence of
an economic imbalance in the Agreement, in such a way that rate increases would

turn out to be justifiable."321

196. Regarding the decision not to extend the Contract for another ten years, provided in
Ruling 333, Costa Rica states that it was not unfair, arbitrary, unpredictable or
capricious, and therefore it is not a violation of fair and equitable treatment.32
Respondent mentions that the resolution included the reasons and the legal basis why
the MPWT decided not to extend the Contract,323 and the contractual clause224 on which
it relied to do so.3%5 Also, Costa Rica counters that Ruling 333 was not a "rescission",
nor a "termination", as mentioned by the Claimant,%*6 and instead claims that SyC’s
assertion that the MPWT by reversing said Ruling, “...acknowledged that it had issued

Resolution 333 unfairly and arbitrarily’*’ is false.

197. Furthermore, given that the Contract was subsequently extended for another ten years,
Costa Rica concludes that the original decision not to extend it caused no damage to
SyC. It is worth noting that Ruling 333 was reversed and annulled by the MPWT before

the exhaustion of the initial term.228

198. As for SyC’s challenge of the constitutional and legal authority of the Comptroller to

countersign the Contract, Costa Rica asserts the following:*?

a) SyC attacks the Comptroller's authority to countersign for the first time in its

Reply, and in no previous process that power had been challenged.

b) The Parties, including the company Riteve controlled by Claimant,
recognized the Comptroller’s authority, as well as the necessity to obtain its
countersignature, and followed the opinion and guidelines of said entity

voluntarily.

c) Clauses 4.1, 9.4 and 12.5 of the Contract, which refer to the countersignature
requirement, prove false SyC’s assertions that the countersignature was not
included as a requirement in the Contract. These clauses mention that the
countersignature is the starting point and prior step to the contractor's
operations, using the countersignature as the date from which the term for
the publication of the rate adjustment methodology must be counted.
Respondent also argues that any amendment or extension of the Contract
required the Comptroller’s countersignature. This implies that the
countersignature is required for the entry into force of the Contract, because
if the Contract did not require countersignature it would make no sense to

submit its amendments of extensions to countersignature.

d

As to SyC’s claim that the Comptroller had no authority to countersign the
Contract because the Contract does not provide for payments with public
funds, given that the Contract expressly refers to the requirement of
countersignature, Costa Rica argues that it is not necessary to answer this
statement. However, Respondent mentions that according to Article 8 of the
Organic Law, the term "Public Treasury" is not limited only to public

fundraising, but also covers issues such as "administrative contracts", being

329 Rejoinder §§ 80-142.
102

bound to ensure the legal integrity of the administrative contracts in the light
of the applicable law. Moreover, the very concept of "public funds" is wide,
and includes obligations under administrative contracts, according to Article
9 of the Organic Law. Active payment of funds by the State is not required
for a contract to necessitate countersignature. Instead if the Contract is subject
to the rules of government contracting and under the legal concept of public
treasury and public funds, both concepts being broad, a contract will require

countersignature.

e

Regarding the official notice through which the Comptroller decided not to
countersign the First Contract, for not being in line with the law, SyC made
several observations. Respondent explains that the reason why the
Comptroller opposed its own formula (published on December 2, 1982) was
that said formula had to do only with continued supply contracts, services
contracts and leases not related to buildings or premises, in which an
automatic adjustment formula was acceptable, but that formula was not
applicable to the VTI service as clarified by the Comptroller, because it is a
public service provided by the private sector on behalf of the State and paid
directly by users, rather than a service provided by the private sector directly

to the State, in which case the aforementioned formula would apply.

f) SyC argues that the Comptroller’s decision not to countersign the Contract
did not challenge the Consortium’s right to economic and financial balance,
nor the power to make rate adjustments. Costa Rica states that it does not
deny that right of SyC, but claims that such adjustments apply only in certain
circumstances described in the Contract and in the official notice issued by

the Comptroller.

g) SyC asserts that the Non-Countersignature Official Notice recognized that
rate readjustment should not be limited only to the component of inflation,
but failed to mention that said official notice confirms this by stating that

"...the contractor may qualify for a readjustment from the moment an increase occurs

103

390 Rej

 

in the service provision costs, which must be documented and, on every occasion,

submitted for approval by the Public Transport Council...”330

SyC argues that the Non-Countersignature Official Notice does not conclude
on the inadmissibility of a methodology based on mathematical formulas
using objective indexes. However, this does not mean that said methodology
was appropriate, especially if it is considered that in the same official notice
the Comptroller stated that the economic and financial balance of the
Contract will be maintained when the PTC, during the rate revisions, ".

makes the respective rate studies based on the financial information submitted by the

contractor as has already been established in the request for proposals."331

SyC argues that the Comptroller agreed that an ordinary rate readjustment
should occur every year; nevertheless, Respondent states that the
Comptroller did do no more than refer to the rate review mechanism of the
First Contract, which was a mere description of a contractual clause, not

something that the Comptroller had accepted.

As to SyC’s argument that the countersignature, as a simple act of approval
of a contract to be effective, cannot define the content thereof, Costa Rica
states that in the case of not being able to countersign a contract for being
contrary to the law, the Comptroller should issue a reasoned decision that
specifies the errors that should be corrected in order to remedy the deficiency
that prevents the countersignature. Furthermore, this decision does not
imply any substitution of the agreement of the parties, and may be
challenged. Therefore, the Comptroller’s aim when issuing its Non-
Countersignature Official Notice was to point out to the parties the legal

flaws that prevented the First Contract from being approved.

332 Rej

In the case of the Comptroller’s statements before the Legislative Assembly on April 16,
2013, cited by SyC in order to infer that the Comptroller exercised powers of the
Administration that did not correspond to it when issuing its Non-Countersignature
Official Notice and Countersignature Official Notice, Costa Rica does not question the
content of what is cited, since said statements do not refer to the contents of the
mentioned official notices. In the same statement the Comptroller refers to the process
of countersignature and the Comptroller’s authority to (i) not countersign a contract
that does not comply with the laws; and (ii) to indicate to the parties the legal errors

that must be corrected.222

Regarding the alleged disregard by the Consortium of the position of the Comptroller,
Respondent considers it a false statement since once the Non-Countersignature Official
Notice had been issued, the Consortium itself, together with the PTC, undertook the
correction of the First Contract’s legal defects by signing a new version that rectified
those deficiencies. Thus, SyC cannot claim that it was not aware of that official notice,
especially when knowing that getting the countersignature was required for the
Contract’s enforcement. Also, Reply Exhibit C-84 indicates that the Comptroller's
opinion about Executive Order 30185 was known by the Consortium on the same day
that the VTI Supervisory Authority made it known to the PTC in a meeting on May 6,
2002.333

On the issue of the Comptroller's powers, Costa Rica states that at the Hearing,
Claimant's legal expert, Mr. Carlos Vargas Arguedas, recognized that all contracts are
subject to countersignature, including the Contract in question, and that the
Comptroller did not exceed its powers by issuing the Countersignature Official Notice.
Claimant's other legal expert also confirmed that the Comptroller acted in strict
compliance with the rules when issuing the Non-Countersignature Official Notice and

the Countersignature Official Notice. Therefore, Costa Rica asserts that Claimant failed

353 Rejoinder § 137; Exhibit C-84, pp. 12, 13.

105

to support its argument that the Comptroller exceeded its functions, improperly acting

as co-manager of the Contract.*4

Although SyC said at the Hearing that both Executive Order 30185 and 30396 had been
revoked "without any explanation” 335 Ms. Cerdas explained during the Hearing that on
May 6, 2002, PTC officers met with Comptroller officers to discuss the VTI service rate
issue, and that the Comptroller officers highlighted that the rate readjustment formula
provided in Executive Order 30185 was invalid, given that it was based on overall
indexes, as the Comptroller had previously stated in its Non-Countersignature Official
Notice and Countersignature Official Notice. Also, Ms. Cerdas argued that on the same
day PTC officers informed Riteve in writing of the observations made by the
Comptroller, and after analyzing the content of Executive Order 30185 in view of such
comments, the PTC and the MPWT agreed with the Comptroller and considered that
the rate readjustment methodology should be adjusted according to such indications in

order to amend the error.236

As for the approval and publication of a methodology for the VTI service rate
readjustment, Costa Rica contends that contrary to what Claimant indicates, as was
confirmed in the Hearing by Ms. Cerdas, Director of Legal Affairs of the PTC, the PTC
has approved rate adjustment formulas on five occasions, and it was SyC who opposed
their adoption by administrative and judicial proceedings.” The methodologies that

have been approved by the PTC are the following:

“(i) rate adjustment formula approved by the [PTC] Board of Directors on 16
September 2003, agreeing to a 13.13% rate increase;

54 Post Hearing Brief of Costa Rica §§ 75-76.
335 Post Hearing Brief of Costa Rica § 88, quoting Transcript Day 1, (ENG), p. 190: 21-22.
336 Post Hearing Brief of Costa Rica §§ 88-89.
357 Post Hearing Brief of Costa Rica §§ 96-97.

106

(ii) rate adjustment formula approved by the [PTC] Board of Directors on 23
October 2003, which maintained the 13.13% increase approved on 16 September

2003, but considered minor changes to the figures;

(iii) rate calculation methodology proposed by Despacho Carvajal and approved
by the [PTC] Board of Directors on 28 May 2004;

(iv) rate adjustment formula approved by the [PTC] Board of Directors on 16
December 2005; and

(v) rate adjustment formula approved by the [PTC] Board of Directors on 19
December 2006.”338

204. Also, the instances in which Riteve opposed the methodologies approved by the Board

of Directors were the following:

“(i) application for partial revocation with subsidiary appeal filed by Riteve SyC
on 19 January 2005 against the [PTC] Board of Directors’ decision approving the
12.76% [VTI] rate increase for 2005, approved on 16 December 2004;

(ii) local ordinary proceeding initiated by Riteve SyC on 20 February 2006 against

[PTC] and the State (File: 06-000159-0163-CA), requesting annulment of the
[PTC] Board agreement to approve a 12,76% increase of [VTI] rates for 2005,
approved on 16 December 2004;

(iii) application for partial revocation with a subsidiary appeal lodged by Riteve
SyC on 15 January 2007 against the agreement adopted by the [PTC] Board of
Directors on 19 December 2006, approving a new rate methodology proposed by
the Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Econdmicas of the Universidad de

Costa Rica (IICE”);

338 Post Hearing Brief of Costa Rica § 98.
107

205.

206.

207.

(iv) application for review, clarification and addition lodged by Riteve SyC against
the Resolution of the [MPWT] of 12 March 2009, in which the [MPWT] had
accepted the appeal lodged by Riteve SyC on 15 January 2007; and

(v) the rejection of the IICE methodology presented by Riteve SyC on 6 July
2009.39

On the other hand, Costa Rica recalls that it has never denied Riteve the right to obtain
rate readjustments in the scenario of an imbalance as contemplated in the Contract, but
Claimant, who has the burden of proof to demonstrate that imbalance, has never done

$0,340

Costa Rica also mentions that the contractor does not have the possibility of unlimited
profit, as alleged by SyC, given the explicit limitation to profitability in clause 1.1 of the
Contract when defining "economic financial equilibrium” 341 Costa Rica emphasizes the
modest expectations SyC had regarding the return on its investment, as revealed by the
projections contained in Riteve’s Economic Projection 1998-2008, in which Claimant
had projected an internal rate of return of 13.28%, as confirmed at the Hearing by the
majority partner of Claimant, Mr. Amador de Castro.3#2 Furthermore, SyC’s own expert,
Mr. Nicholas Good, confirmed that he agreed with the calculation of Costa Rica’s expert
in damages, Mr. Hart, that Riteve has had an internal rate of return of 31.75%, which is

almost equivalent to three times the one originally projected by Claimant.

As for the principle of economic and financial balance of the Contract, which according
to SyC would apply only to the extraordinary rate readjustments, but not to the regular
ones, Costa Rica alleges that even Claimant's legal expert, Ms. Rivera, confirmed that

the principle of economic balance applies also to regular reviews.*4

208. Costa Rica also notes that the rate adjustment sought by Claimant is not justified if one
takes into account that the rate stipulated in its Offer was the highest, combined with
the fact that the volume of inspections increased exponentially (much higher than

originally projected), as did the company profits.#45

209. As for the rules of contract interpretation according to Costa Rican law, Respondent

states the following:

“...in the event the Agreement is deemed to be unclear, the Costa Rican legal
system provides an interpretation canon that must be respected, as follows: in the
event of a vague Administration contract clause, ‘public interest shall prevail’, as
provided by the PGR in its Legal Opinion OJ-190-2001 of 5 December 2001. The
RFP bid documents establish the mechanisms to select the bid that best suits public
interest, and public interest continue to be the guiding principle throughout the

contract execution phase.

Another fundamental principle to consider regarding contract interpretation is the
principle of efficiency, provided in Article 10 of the General Law of Public
Administration. This Article provides that ‘administrative norms shall be
interpreted in the manner that best guarantees achievement of the public goal
pursued, fully respectful of the relevant rights and interests.’ The norm also
provides that administrative norms should be ‘interpreted and integrated
considering other related norms, and the value and nature of the conduct and facts
to which it refers.’ Therefore, the administrative norm must be interpreted in the
best manner possible to guarantee achieving the public goal pursued, with full

respect for the relevant rights and interests...”346

210. Respondent answers that the reason the State decided to reverse Executive Orders

30185 and 30396 issued by MPWT, through Executive Order 30573, was that they were

345 Post Hearing Brief of Costa Rica § 142.
346 Post Hearing Brief of Costa Rica §§ 169-170.

109

211.

contrary to law and to the previous Comptroller's criteria,34” for the same reason the
First Contract was not countersigned. Moreover, the legality of Decree 30573 was
confirmed by a competent national court, which rejected Riteve’s request for annulment
considering that Executive Order 30573 was "absolutely legal", stating that "it would not
be appropriate to affirm that the [Executive Order] objected is arbitrary.”*48 This is so because
the methodology provided in Executive Order 30185 was contrary to Costa Rican law
for it was not based on the Consortium’s actual costs and expenses, nor on a proven
imbalance in the economic and financial conditions of the Contract, but rather on

general indexes that resulted in automatic rate increases.¥#

As to Executive Order 30396, Respondent states that it had to be reversed because "...by
founding [Executive Order 30396] on the provisions and methodology of [Executive Order
30185], the last one, the repeal of which turns out to be imperative, it determined that both
regulations must be left without effect or value...”%° Therefore, Costa Rica claims that the
State corrected defects from which the Consortium “...would have benefited, but benefits
to which it had never been entitled...” Thus, even if SyC suffered damage as a result of
losing a “...unexpected benefit..."55! it had no right to, the correction of the error cannot
be considered a State violation, even if the correction caused the loss of the windfall

profit. In that regard, Costa Rica states that:

“...that [Executive Order 30573] which the Claimant calls ‘unfair’ and
‘arbitrary’, has a rational base, is consistent and coherent with previous
pronouncements of the comptroller entity of the State (the Comptroller’s Office),
is in conformity with the clause of the Agreement regarding rate adjustments
(Clause 9.4), is neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, did not alter the legal frame
that existed when the Claimant made its investment, and keeps a rational relation
with the principles of service at cost and economic financial balance that govern

the privity of contract with Riteve SyC. Consequently, it is not possible to conclude

in any way that, by adopting [Executive Order 30573], Costa Rica has violated its

obligation to give fair and equitable treatment.”352

Costa Rica also argues that the decision to open the market to allow other companies to
provide the VTI service, reflected in Article 19 of the Transit Law of 2008,"...was in no
way unfair, unforeseen, capricious, arbitrary, discriminatory; neither does it in any way become
a breach by Costa Rica of the obligation to give the Claimant fair and equitable treatment ...
neither can such decision be deemed a violation of the exclusive right Riteve SyC has under the

Agreement.” 353

Costa Rica argues that said decision was taken because of the obligation to protect the
public interest and to ensure the continuity of the VTI service in the country, in view of
the fact that given the possibility that the Contract would not be extended, or that it
could be terminated earlier by either party, "...it was reasonable for the State to take the
necessary precautions so that another company (or companies) could provide [VTI] service in
Costa Rica ..."354 It involved, in any case, predictable provisions, and the Claimant could
not have legitimately had the expectation that "...the State would never consider permitting
another company or other companies to provide the [VTI] service ..." or that"... it would have

a monopoly ad perpetuum for providing the [VTI] service in Costa Rica ..."355

Additionally, Respondent claims that given that in reality no other company has been
authorized to provide the VTI services in Costa Rica, the decision to open the market
did not interfere with SyC’s investment, as it continues to be the exclusive provider of
the service and said decision did not cause Claimant any damage. Consequently,

Respondent has not breached any obligation under the Treaty.35°

Respondent states that SyC mixed in its claim about arbitrary or discriminatory

measures two concepts of international investment law without defining the scope of

352 Counter-Memorial § 351.
358 Counter-Memorial § 421.
354 Counter-Memorial § 423.

217.

either: (i) the obligation not to obstruct investments by arbitrary or discriminatory
measures provided in Article III.2 of the Treaty, and (ii) the national treatment

obligation contained in Article IV of the Treaty.”

Regarding the scope of the obligation not to obstruct investments by arbitrary or
discriminatory measures, Respondent asserts, based on case law, that for a measure
attributable to the State to be considered arbitrary "...there must be an important dose of
intentionality, very serious and shocking error in the State behavior. It is clear and beyond
question that a mere legal error on itself does not constitute arbitrariness.”358 Regarding the
concept of discrimination, Costa Rica cites the tribunal’s opinion in the Enron case, in
which the existence of a"...capricious, irrational or absurd..." treatment given to economic

sectors was considered necessary for considering there had been discrimination.*?

With regard to measures that SyC invokes as contrary to Article III.2 of the Treaty, Costa
Rica has stated the following: (i) Executive Order 30573-MPWT, whereby Executive
Orders 30185 and 30396 were revoked, is not arbitrary or discriminatory for it has a
rational and factual basis, meets regulations and pre-established standards, and follows
the aims and objectives of a rational policy established by the State for public services,
both before and after its issuance; (ii) the decision not to extend the Contract
contained in Ruling 333 was not arbitrary or discriminatory, given that it was based on
the good faith interpretation of Clause 4.2 of the Contract, in light of the Comptroller's
official notices, was rationally related to a legitimate public policy to promote free
competition in the VTI service, was not unfair, and ultimately caused no adverse effects
to Riteve given that it was revoked and annulled before the exhaustion of the initial ten
year term of the Contract;**! (iii) the decision to promote the participation of as many
VTI service providers as possible is not arbitrary or discriminatory, since it is rational
to both take provisions in case Riteve stopped providing the VTI service and to adopt

and promote a free competition policy for the benefit of users, which cannot be

considered as a discriminatory or arbitrary decision, given that no provision of the
Transit Law of 2008 or other governmental act has excluded Riteve from participating
in COSEVI's public procurement contracts in order to provide the VTI service,3 nor
does it violate Article III.2 of the Treaty given that it did not hinder the enjoyment of
the investment; (iv) the rate increase ordered by PSRA for other public services
(water, electricity, fuel, public transport) is not an arbitrary or discriminatory measure,
because they are different sectors, participants are situated in different circumstances
and they involve objective differences that arise from the application of the principle of

service at cost in each industry.

Costa Rica states that SyC’s statement relating the absence of a technical report attached
to Ruling 333 to an alleged political motivation by the State, is false. In this regard, Costa
Rica has never denied that Ruling 333 was issued without such report, and the ruling
of June 15, 2012 by which the above-mentioned Ruling 333 was revoked, indicated that
expressly. However, Costa Rica argues that it is wrong to claim that not accompanying
the resolution with a technical report involves purely political reasons that were not
based on a legitimate interest, or that the State had no right to decide not to extend the
Contract. Costa Rica argues it was a decision "...that was made based on the legitimate
interest in opening the market up to competition (in the public interest of benefitting the user)
as was determined in Clause 4.2 of the Agreement and the provisions in the Transit Law of
2008."35 Also, Respondent rejects SyC’s demand that Costa Rica compensate it for that
market opening, because Claimant has failed to prove the existence of damages,
especially considering that the decision not to extend the contract was ultimately
reversed and had no effect, furthered by Claimant acknowledging in its Reply that it
was a decision legitimately protected by a State law. Moreover, clause 4.2 of the

Respondent's representatives, witnesses, and experts acknowledged that at no time
were Riteve’s operations interrupted.3* Costa Rica mentions that Riteve’s exclusivity
right has not been infringed, having been confirmed by SyC’s legal expert, Mr.

Hernandez Valle, that there is no other VTI service operator in Costa Rica.%6?

In relation to the Direct Agreement of July 20, 2012, and the publication of the attached
executive order draft, the former minister Rivera stated in the Hearing that even prior
to the signing of said agreement, he spoke with Ms. Rivera, Riteve’s attorney, about the
fact that the promulgation of the executive order would not be stipulated as an
obligation.2”° So Claimant was aware that the draft would require several amendments

and compliance with several requirements before being published.37!

Costa Rica claims to have demonstrated that it did not fail to comply with its obligation
to give fair and equitable treatment, because it was not proven that Costa Rica had
infringed the high threshold of the fair and equitable treatment legal standard under
the Treaty.

14 Denial of Justice
(i) Position of SyC

Claimant asserts that a denial of justice arises when a court with competence and
jurisdiction issues a ruling in violation of due process and where a court's decision is

clearly inappropriate, causing unfair treatment to the investor.”

SyC cites Saipem SpA v. the People's Republic of Bangladesh as an example of a denial of
justice by a domestic court annulling the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal, where the
arbitral tribunal concluded that the standard for rejecting the jurisdiction and the
manner in which the judge applied the standard to the rights constituted an abuse of
law, given that domestic courts "... cannot use their jurisdiction to overturn arbitrators for
reasons unrelated to misconduct because they generate large risks against the just resolution of

the dispute ..."°75
In light of the foregoing, SyC argues that the First Chamber of the Supreme Court's
Judgment 906 A-04 dated October 21, 2004, deprived Riteve of access to justice by

preventing the contractually agreed mechanism from being able to take effect.374

Claimant's allegations in this regard relate to access to justice, and imply that:

a

There was an arbitration agreement;

s

Arbitration was valid under the law according to which it was agreed upon;

and

a

The State subsequently invoked the incompetence of the arbitral tribunal

based on aspects of its own domestic law.375

Regarding the judgment issued on November 18, 2012 by the Administrative
Contentious Court, SyC states that said judgment may not be submitted by Costa Rica
to support that there was not a breach of Contract by the State, since that judgment only
discussed the claim of invalidity, not contractual issues. The parties expressly agreed
in the Direct Agreement that in the event a contractual dispute arose, they would waive
local forum and submit the dispute to international arbitration. Therefore, SyC argues

the Administrative Contentious Court cannot rule extra petita, and could only make

statements limited to declaring an executive order or an agreement null, but could not

issue a decision on whether or not the PTC fulfilled its contractual obligations.*”

(ii) Position of Costa Rica

227. In response to SyC’s claim that the Supreme Court denied it justice by declaring that
the local arbitral tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear disputes concerning the
interpretation and application of norms of public order, referring to the methodology
for the readjustment of rates, Costa Rica considers that such claim has no legal or factual

grounds.277

228. On the one hand, Costa Rica states that under International Public Law, and according
to several awards,2’8 the legal standard for denial of justice implies an extremely high

and severe threshold that the investor must meet to prove that a State has denied justice.

229. Based on the provisions of various international tribunals, Costa Rica claims that
"...there is no denial of justice by the simple fact that the decision of a local tribunal (or the
procedure that has been followed) is mistaken, not ideal, the result of a non-convincing rationale,
unsatisfactory, shameful, or with irregularities. .."379 It is noteworthy that the decision of the
Supreme Court upheld the opinions of various authorities (the Comptroller, the
Attorney General, and PTC) that argue that the establishment of rates is under the non-

delegable jurisdiction of the State, and therefore cannot be delegated to an arbitral

that SyC quoted as an example of denial of justice when a domestic court annuls the jurisdiction of an arbitral
tribunal, Costa Rica states that it is a wrong reference given that in said case the issue of expropriation and not
the issue of denial of justice was studied. As for the case Duke Energy v. Republic of Ecuador, ICSID Case No.
ARB/04/19, Award, August 18, 2008 (Exhibit RL-32), Costa Rica claims that the paragraph quoted by SyC
corresponds toa summary of what the Claimant said in that case, and not of what the arbitral tribunal said, aiso
the quoted section does not refer to denial of justice. Counter-Memorial §§ 439-440.

tribunal.380 Furthermore, Respondent relies on case law to argue that "...international
tribunals are not a court of appeals, nor do they have the task of assessing whether or not the

decision of the local court was correct or adjusted to the municipal law...”381

Likewise, Costa Rica states that SyC cannot claim that it has been denied access to the
court system to resolve the dispute, given that the judgment of the Supreme Court
established that the public authority to exercise setting and readjusting rates was not
beyond the control of the contentious-administrative jurisdiction, evidenced by
Claimant submitting the dispute to that jurisdiction after such judgment had been

issued.382

As to the alleged denial of justice by the Supreme Court’s decision regarding the
domestic arbitration, Costa Rica notes that at the Hearing Claimant challenged the

entire judicial system of Costa Rica, stating that the courts of Costa Rica are "...not
honest...”;383 even though Claimant's own legal expert, Mr. Hernandez Valle, disagreed
with these allegations, considering that such courts act properly, and that those same

courts have decided several actions in favor of SyC in the past.34

In light of the foregoing, Costa Rica states that when applying the standard of denial of
justice under international law to the only fact on which SyC based its claim, it must be

concluded that Costa Rica has not engaged in denial of justice.285

2. FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY

(i) Position of SyC

SyC argues that Costa Rica, through unilateral actions, breached its obligation to grant

at all times full legal protection and security.386

As to the acts that constitute a violation by Costa Rica of its obligation to grant full
protection and security to SyC’s investment, Claimant invokes Costa Rica’s alleged

violations of the obligation to grant fair and equitable treatment.

(ii) Position of Costa Rica

Respondent states that international courts agree that the legal standard of full
protection and security does not impose strict liability on the States; therefore, it does
not protect the investor from any possible decline in the investment’s value,**” and it is

primarily an obligation of vigilance, a due diligence...",88 that “...is nothing but

  

reasonable prevention measures that can be expected from a well-managed government under

similar circumstances...” 389 which must be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Further, Respondent asserts that SyC confuses the concepts of full protection and
security with fair and equitable treatment, first quoting the provision of the Treaty that
refers to full protection and security, but later citing case law related to fair and
equitable treatment.2 Respondent also points out that SyC only referred once to the
standard of full protection and security, the award issued in the case of Asian Agriculture
Products v. Sri Lanka, without mentioning that in the same award the tribunal
concluded, like other tribunals, that such obligation cannot be interpreted as "...strict
liability..."°9! and that the requirement of stability and predictability of the commercial
legal system that SyC invokes as part of the obligation to give full protection and
security is in fact part of the obligation to give fair and equitable treatment. Respondent
also argues there is no legal basis for SyC’s assertion that Costa Rica’s breach of contract

automatically involve the failure to give full protection and security or fair and

equitable treatment.” Similarly, SyC invokes various measures concerning the alleged
infringement of its obligation to provide full protection and security, which Respondent

states that:

“Claimant does not analyze any of these measures in light of the legal standard of
full protection and security under the Treaty. It does not explain how they
constitute an omission by Costa Rica regarding its due diligence duty that consists
in taking reasonable measures to protect the investment. Consequently, and just
and with its other claims, the Claimant has not met its burden of proof to establish
that the actions of Costa Rica were contrary to its obligation to grant full protection

and security to the Claimant's investment. ..”3%

237. In relation to each of the measures referred to by SyC, Costa Rica indicates the

following:

a) Regarding Executive Order 30573, the State exercised due diligence under the
circumstances, taking reasonable measures to protect the investment. In case
the automatic rate increase had been approved according to the methodology
established in Executive Order 30185, ”...those increases would have had to be
reverted and the tariff increase would have had to be reimbursed to the user ...”, and

that it “...could have been a damage to Riteve SyC ...”°°4

b) With respect to the decision to open the market, this measure was not unfair,
arbitrary or discriminatory. Despite the provisions of the Transit Law of 2008,
Costa Rica has always respected SyC’s right to contractual exclusivity, since

to date it remains the only provider of VTI service.2%

c) The decision not to extend the Contract was reasonable and rational, in

addition to the fact that this decision was reversed.**°

d) Respondent claims it is false that Costa Rica was obligated to publish a
particular methodology for rate readjustment before August 20, 2012, since
that date was only mentioned in relation to Riteve waiving any additional
rate claims if Costa Rica published this methodology before that date.
Therefore, such obligation tied only Riteve, and did not require anything

from Costa Rica.°”

3. NATIONAL AND MOST FAVORED NATION TREATMENT

(i) Position of SyC

SyC claims that Costa Rica has breached its obligation to provide its investment a
treatment no less favorable than the treatment given to its own investor's investments

or incomes.

Claimant alleges that Costa Rica has arbitrarily failed to adjust the rates applicable to
the VTI service between July 2002 and July 2012. The increase of the VTI service rates
represented only 12.7% ,3%8 while in the case of other services (water, electricity, public

transport, super petrol, diesel) PSRA approved rate increases over 250% .3%

(ii) Position of Costa Rica

In its Counter-Memorial, Costa Rica challenged SyC’s use of the applicable standard
under the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) through the most favored
nation clause. In its Reply SyC decided to "...reverse its course so that it could now invoke
another fair and equitable treatment standard, rather than the one it had originally invoked...” 4

now having the Arbitral Tribunal to focus on the standard referred to under the Treaty.

244,

Costa Rica states that the Arbitral Tribunal should not allow SyC to invoke a standard
in its Memorial, and then invoke a different standard in its Reply, because it violates

the Respondent's rights to defense.4!

Costa Rica claims it did not violate its obligation to give fair and equitable treatment
under the Treaty. Respondent mentions that under that autonomous standard of
protection, any error or omission may not constitute an infringement, but it must be
acts of State "...manifestly inconsistent, non-transparent, unreasonable (that is, not related to

a rational policy), or discriminatory...”42 factors Claimant has not demonstrated.

4, MEASURES EQUIVALENT TO EXPROPRIATION

 

Position of SyC

SyC asserts that Article V of the Treaty provides that for a measure tantamount to
expropriation to be valid, it must be taken for public utility reasons, in accordance with
legal provisions, in a non-discriminatory manner, and accompanied by prompt,
adequate and effective compensation.‘ SyC also argues that "...the termination or
arbitrary suppression of a right previously granted contractually is a measure equivalent to

expropriation. ..” 404

In light of the foregoing, SyC argues that Costa Rica has breached its obligation not to
subject its investment to nationalization, expropriation or any other measure having
equivalent effects, except if such measures were non-discriminatory, adopted for
reasons of public utility or public interest, and accompanied by a prompt, adequate and

effective compensation.

This is based on the grounds that the government adopted measures tantamount to

expropriation when it unilaterally changed the rights previously agreed under the

402 Rejoinder § 152.

Contract, and issued these measures without due payment of a prompt, adequate and

effective compensation.

245. Claimant's allegations in this regard refer to:

a) The termination or arbitrary suppression of a right previously awarded by

contract is a measure tantamount to expropriation.

b) The Contract granted SyC the exclusive right to provide the VTI service as

sole contractor during the term of the Contract and its extensions.

v. Was issued unfairly and arbitrarily, given that it did not comply with

the report referred to in clause 4.2 of the Contract.

(ii) Position of Costa Rica

Respondent argues that when applying the legal standard of indirect expropriation,
SyC’s claim that Costa Rica indirectly expropriated its investment lacks grounds.
Although Claimant also states that there is indirect expropriation when there is
interference with contractual rights, citing the award issued in Sempra v. Argentina,
Respondent claims this is weak evidence since the Sempra tribunal dealt with the issue
of direct expropriation rather than indirect, and held that the interference with

contractual rights can under certain circumstances be tantamount to expropriation.”

Further, Respondent asserts that SyC bases its expropriation claim only on Ruling 333,
which was reversed and annulled before the exhaustion of the Contract’s first ten year

term, and the provision of the service by Riteve was never interrupted.

In conclusion, Respondent argues that SyC has not proved the existence of an
expropriation, so it is not relevant to consider whether the requirements for legal
expropriation under Article V of the Treaty were met or not. Lastly, Costa Rica argues
that Claimant has failed to prove that it ceased to receive a higher income because of

actions adopted by the government.48

C. EXISTENCE OF DAMAGES

(i) Position of SyC

SyC asserts that in thirteen years no governmental authority has denied Riteve the rate

readjustment based on the argument that its profits or returns are excessive. Claimant

remarks that the real reason the rates have not been adjusted is because there is a

conflict of jurisdiction between the MPWT and the PSRA.*”

SyC also notes that the compensation due to the Claimant amounts to €297.9 million
euros. Applying Executive Order 30185, the damages are calculated as follows: (i) €85.7
million euros for SyC’s loss for not receiving the rate readjustment during the initial
term of the Contract; (ii) €41.5 million euros for SyC’s loss due to the lack of rate
readjustment between July 15, 2012 and July 14, 2014; and (iii) €170.7 million euros for
SyC’s loss due to the lack of rate readjustment between July 15, 2014 and July 14, 2022.410

Claimant also mentions that Costa Rica’s expert, Timothy Hart, acknowledged at the
Hearing that the Contract did not include a constraint on profitability or rate of

return.‘

With regard to the provisions on taxation, SyC states that expert Nicholas Good
deducted the amounts corresponding to taxes that Riteve would have paid both in
Costa Rica and when distributing dividends;*!2 however, it is possible for Costa Rica to
conclude that its national law allows it to tax compensations with a tax on foreign
remittances of 30%. In this regard, SyC states that there would be double taxation,
because (i) the figures calculated by the expert Nicholas Good already subtracted values
for Costa Rican taxes; (ii) a 30% tax would be imposed regarding foreign remittances
which would not be deductible in Spain; and (iii) in addition to the above, SyC would
also be taxed in Spain at a rate of 30% when receiving the payment ordered by the
Arbitral Tribunal, even if applying the provisions of the International Agreement on
Double Taxation entered into by and between the Kingdom of Spain and Costa Rica.113
In light of the foregoing, SyC requests the Arbitral Tribunal to order the payment of net
amounts, considering that in the calculation of the amounts due, the taxes that would

have been due to Costa Rica were already taken into account, and that under the

Agreement between Spain and Costa Rica on Double Taxation the award should only

be taxed in the State of the taxpayer’s residence, i.e., only in Spain. *!*

(ii) Position of Costa Rica

Respondent claims that SyC is not entitled to the requested compensation of no less
than €261.6 million euros, corresponding to the damage caused by the alleged breaches
of Contract by Costa Rica, because it has proved that it did not breach any of its

obligations under the Treaty.

Likewise, Respondent argues that even assuming that Costa Rica had violated any of
the referred obligations under the Treaty, SyC has not been able to prove that it suffered
indemnifiable material damage because of said breach, given that the economic and
financial balance of the Contract has not been affected.*!5 On the contrary, from 2004
through 2011 "...Riteve SyC has had an exponential growth of 724% in its profits with respect

to the initially invested capital..."41

Furthermore, Costa Rica points out the inconsistency between the amount of damages
estimated by Riteve in the local court proceeding of USD $16,279,269 for damages
allegedly suffered between July 2002 and December 2005, and the amount claimed in

this arbitration, equivalent to about USD $320 million.”

As for the Direct Agreement and the Contractual Addendum, both dated July 20, 2012,
Costa Rica adds that assuming without conceding that the Direct Agreement had
imposed an obligation on Costa Rica as alleged by SyC, this would not justify the
significant compensation that SyC claims, since both the Direct Agreement and the
Contractual Addendum were signed on July 20, 2012, and therefore any damage

suffered by the Claimant in relation to those instruments must have occurred after that

date. Apart from the fact that such a large economic loss cannot be justified in such a

short time, SyC has not detailed the full amount of the damages allegedly suffered.*!*

Relying on the findings of its expert Timothy Hart, Costa Rica specifies that from
September 30, 2001 to December 31, 2011, Riteve’s investors achieved a total return on
their capital contribution of 644% (21.6% annually), paying dividends of CRC €18,301
million colons (about $34.6 million), representing a return to investors in its second year
of 679% (22.2% annually). Respondent also notes that the analysis provided by SyC
through Mr. Good "...takes into account the cost increase to Riteve SyC’s operations, but
completely ignores other changes that affect the economic balance of the company, including
changes to earnings, income or return on investment. It is obvious and undeniable that it is
impossible to assess the existence of a balance if one takes into account only one side of the scale;

i.e., costs but not profits...” 419

Costa Rica also asserts that SyC’s damages claim is deficient given that it does not take
into account the principles of reasonableness and limits on profitability, which are an

integral part of the rates for all public service in Costa Rica, including the VTI service.12°

Costa Rica counters that SyC’s request for the Arbitral Tribunal to deal with possible
double taxation of SyC both in Spain and Costa Rica, in case the award is favorable to
SyC (i) is a very late claim, considering that the Reply is the first document in which it
is mentioned; (ii) is outside the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, involving matters
arising from the arbitral award that are subsequent to its issuance; (iii) SyC does not
base its request on any provision of the Treaty, the ICSID Convention, its Arbitration
Rules or case law; and (iv) the Arbitral Tribunal is exclusively responsible for deciding
whether there has been a breach of the Treaty, and in such case, if the breach caused

damages that should be compensated.42!

Costa Rica notes that in the Hearing it became clear that Claimant has not suffered
losses. Whereas SyC’s compensation claim requires proving that there has been an
economic and financial imbalance of the Contract, Costa Rica states that the president
of Riteve himself, Mr. José Luis Lopez, explained that the Contract is in balance as long
as the company is not suffering losses.! Costa Rica points out that neither Claimant
nor its witnesses have argued that Riteve has suffered losses. Furthermore, Respondent
points out that the damages expert appointed by the Claimant, Mr. Nicholas Good,
acknowledged that the economic and financial balance of the Contract has not been

affected.423

IX. | ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBUNAL

Before deciding on the issues of jurisdiction and admissibility, the Tribunal will first
analyze Claimant's objection with respect to Respondent's Counter-Memorial filed four

minutes late.

The Tribunal considers that the delay of four minutes by the Respondent to submit its
Counter-Memorial, in which Respondent objected the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, cannot
result in the declaration of default in appearance. Claimant argues in its Reply that the
applicable legal consequences are derived from the Administrative Procedural Code
and the Civil Procedure Code of Cost Rica. This argument must be rejected. The
applicable rules to these arbitral proceedings are the Arbitration Rules, not Costa Rican

procedural rules.

The Parties agreed that this arbitration is governed by the ICSID Arbitration Rules in
force since April 10, 2006. Section 1.1 of the Procedural Order No. 1 establishes the

following:

422 Post Hearing brief of Costa Rica §178, quoting Transcript, Day 2 (SPA), Cross-examination of José Luis Lopez,
p. 122.

423 Post Hearing Brief of Costa Rica §178; quoting Transcript, Day 5 (ENG), Cross-examination of Nicholas Good,

265.

266.

267.

268.

“1.1 These proceedings are conducted in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration

Rules in force as of April 10, 2006...”

Therefore, it is not possible to apply the consequences under the Costa Rican procedural
laws to the current arbitral proceedings governed by the Arbitration Rules. Only the
Arbitration Rules may be referred to in deciding on the late filing of the Counter-

Memorial.

According to Rule 26 (3) of the Arbitration Rules, “[a]ny step taken after expiration of the
applicable time limit shall be disregarded unless the Tribunal, in special circumstances and after
giving the other party an opportunity of stating its views, decides otherwise.” The Tribunal
may thus discretionally, after hearing the Parties, determine if a step taken after

expiration shall be disregarded or not.

In this case, having heard the arguments of the Parties and in exercise of the discretional
authority granted to the Tribunal under Rule 26 (3) of the Arbitration Rules, the
Tribunal reaches the decision that the Counter-Memorial shall be considered presented
on time, given that the delay in its presentation was only four minutes, and did not
cause prejudice to Claimant. Access to justice and the right to be heard should be given
preference over procedural formalities, while always taking into account the standard

of reasonableness.

Having decided on Claimant's objection on the delay, analyzing the arguments of the
Parties in light of the Arbitration Rules, the Treaty, and other applicable laws and
principles of International Law, the Tribunal reaches the following conclusions with

respect to the disputed issues:

A. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY OF THE CLAIMS

The Tribunal finds it necessary to clarify on a preliminary basis the relationship and the
differences between the notions of jurisdiction and admissibility. While a lack of
jurisdiction or a lack of admissibility may lead to the tribunal refusing to hear the case,
each refusal is of a different nature and carries different consequences. Indeed, several

128

269.

270.

271.

272.

consequences arise from this distinction, such as the fact that a court may review
whether an arbitral tribunal had jurisdiction over the dispute, but not review the

admissibility of a claim.

An objection to jurisdiction refers to the ability of a tribunal to hear a case, while an
objection to admissibility refers to the claim itself, assuming that the tribunal has
jurisdiction. When a tribunal finds that a claim is inadmissible, the tribunal must

dismiss said claim without going to its merits (even if the tribunal has jurisdiction).

Several consequences arise from the distinction between jurisdiction and

admissibility:424

a) There is greater procedural flexibility if the tribunal has jurisdiction.

s

There are possible waivers of objections to admissibility.

c) The tribunal is able to consider questions of jurisdiction proprio motus.

d

Questions of admissibility are more likely to be addressed with the merits.

e

Issues of admissibility generally cannot be reviewed.
f) A finding of inadmissibility does not become res judicata.
Whereas jurisdiction refers to the authority or the ability of the Tribunal to hear and

decide upon a case, admissibility refers to the characteristics of the claims submitted to

arbitration.

The characteristics of jurisdiction are the following: (i) it affects the dispute submitted

to arbitration as a whole; (ii) as a general rule, the relevant date for its analysis is the

commencement of arbitration and the events posterior to it are not taken into account;
(iii) its conditions or requirements cannot be renounced by the parties; and (iv)

jurisdiction must be formally analyzed by the Tribunal.

On the other hand, admissibility’s characteristics are the following: (i) it affects the
claims themselves and not the entire dispute itself submitted to arbitration; (ii) the
relevant time period for its analysis starts from the beginning of the arbitration
proceedings until the rendering of the award; and (iii) in general, conditions and

requirements can be renounced by the parties.

Because of this distinction, questions of jurisdiction must be analyzed before answering
questions referring to admissibility, as the issues of jurisdiction refer to the Tribunal’s

power to hear this dispute overall, and not to specific claims.

Therefore, the Tribunal will first have to consider whether it has jurisdiction and

analyze Respondent's objection on jurisdiction ratione materiae.

Once the Tribunal has decided upon its jurisdiction, the Tribunal will then consider the

admissibility of the claims presented by Claimant.
B. JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

Objections to jurisdiction in the present case are related to the jurisdiction ratione
materiae, meaning whether the substance or the object of the dispute falls under the

Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

The issue at stake is whether the claims presented by Claimant under Article III.2 of the
Treaty are violations of the Treaty or mere contractual violations, which would fall

outside the scope of the Treaty.

In general terms, according to International Law, the violation of a contract between a

State and an investor of another State does not constitute by itself a violation of

130

280.

281.

282.

International Law and the Treaty. Such principle has been adopted in various cases. For
example in SGS v. Pakistan, the Tribunal held that “...under general international law, a
violation of a contract entered into by a State with an investor of another State, is not, by itself,

a violation of international law...” 45

However, many investment treaties contain, in addition to the standard protection
clauses, the so-called umbrella clauses or observation of commitments clauses which

host States are required to observe as part of their obligations with foreign investors.

In Noble Ventures v. Romania, the Tribunal asserted that Investment Treaties may include
clauses by virtue of which the host State is obligated to comply with its contractual
obligations with the investors of another State and in case of breach, the contractual

violation is internationalized and is assimilated to a breach of the Treaty.

“., two States may include in a bilateral investment treaty a provision to the effect
that, in the interest of achieving the objects and goals of the treaty, the host State
may incur international responsibility by reason of a breach of its contractual
obligations towards the private investor of the other Party, the breach of contract

being thus ‘internationalized’, i.e. assimilated to a breach of the treaty...”46

It is important to specify that not any contractual breach by the State signatory to an
Investment Treaty that contains an umbrella clause can be alleged as a direct violation
of the Treaty. In El Paso Energy v. Argentina the Tribunal stated that an umbrella clause
cannot transform any contractual claim into a claim under the treaty, and held that the
clause would only be applicable if in the specific case the State acts as sovereign entity

not as a private party:

“.,,[A]n umbrella clause cannot transform any contract claim into a treaty claim,

as this would necessarily imply that any commitments of the State in respect to

 

425 SGS Societé Générale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, ICSID Case No. ABR/01/13, Decision
on Objections to Jurisdiction, August 6, 2003, § 167.

287.

investments, even the most minor ones, would be transformed into treaty claims
... It would be strange indeed if the acceptance of a BIT entailed an international
liability of the State going far beyond the obligation to respect the standards of
protection of foreign investments embodied in the Treaty and rendered it liable for
any violation of any commitment in national or international law ‘with regard to

investments’. .”427

Therefore in order to determine if a contractual breach can be alleged as a violation of
an Investment Treaty, it is necessary to analyze in detail the text of the corresponding

umbrella clause in order to identify the requirements for validity of the claim.

In other words, if the Investment Treaty has an umbrella clause, it is possible to claim
the contractual violations by the State as Treaty violations, provided any requirements

for validity established in the treaty itself are complied with.

In this case, according to Article III.2 of the Treaty, each Contracting Party is obligated
to comply with any obligation it has contracted in relation to the investments of
investors of the other Contracting Party.*8 This provision constitutes an umbrella

clause or commitment observation clause.

Respondent argues that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the claims by SyC under
the umbrella clause contained in Article III.2 of the Treaty due to the fact that the parties
to the Contract are Costa Rica and Riteve, and not SyC. Since there is no direct
contractual relationship, the contractual breaches cannot be considered violations of the

Treaty.

However, the Tribunal considers that the protection of Article III.2 of the Treaty goes
beyond the simple direct contractual relationship between the investor and the host

State, because such provision establishes that the State shall comply with the obligations

427 El Paso Energy International Company v. Republic of Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Decision on
Jurisdiction, April 27, 2006, § 82.

428 Exhibit C-3, Article III.2 of the Treaty:
to investments by investors of the other Party

 

... Each Party shall comply with any obligation that it has assumed related

  

132

288.

289.

undertaken “...related to investments by investors of the other Contracting Party ...”. Such
drafting is sufficiently broad to interpret that the obligations contracted by Costa Rica
with Riteve, a company controlled by the Claimant and created exclusively to hold the
rights of the Contract, are included under the scope of protection of the Treaty. As a
result, the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione materiae over the dispute. Arbitrator Silva
Romero respectfully disagrees with the preceding reasoning, which, in his view,
incorrectly centers on the interpretation of the phrase “related to investments”. In his
opinion, special weight must be given to the word “obligation” in the umbrella clause.
This is what the ad hoc annulment Committee in CMS v. Argentina and the tribunal in
Burlington v. Ecuador did when they concluded that privity in a contract between the
investor-claimant and the respondent State is required for the breach of a contractual
obligation to be elevated to the status of a treaty breach. Arbitrator Silva Romero,
however, also comes to the conclusion that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over this case
given that, as held by the Tribunal later on in this Award, Claimant and Riteve are to

be considered as a single entity in this matter.

The criteria for interpreting the scope of the umbrella clause provided in an investment
treaty, as in the present case, are outlined in Article 31 (1) of the Vienna Convention on
the Law of the Treaties, according to which “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in
accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and

in the light of its object and purpose.”

As a result, the Tribunal considers that the appropriate approach is to decide whether
the consent of the State Parties was given in respect to the investor, or in respect to its
investments. In the first case, the scope of the clause is more restricted and in principle
it is limited to the obligations assumed by the State receiving the investment directly
from the investor. In contrast, in the second case, if consent is given with respect to the
investment, the scope of the clause is greater and the contractual relationship does not
necessarily have to be between the host State and the investor, but can for example be

through a subsidiary.

133

290.

291.

292.

293.

The opinion of the Tribunal is consistent with the approach adopted in Enron v.
Argentina, where it was considered that “...while investors can claim in their own right
under the provisions of the treaty, there is indeed a need to establish a cut-off point beyond which
claims would not be permissible as they would have only a remote connection to the affected
company. As this is in essence a question of admissibility of claims, the answer lies in
establishing the extent of the consent to arbitration of the host State. If consent has been given
in respect of an investor and an investment, it can be reasonably concluded that the claims
brought by such investor are admissible under the treaty. If the consent cannot be considered as
extending to another investor or investment, these other claims should then be considered
inadmissible as being only remotely connected with the affected company and the scope of the

legal system protecting that investment...” 429

Consequently, the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione materiae, and the claims asserted by
Claimant alleging the application of Article III.2 of the Treaty would in principle be
admissible. While the Tribunal finds jurisdiction over the dispute, all the claims
asserted by SyC are inadmissible as explained in the following section on admissibility.
Therefore, it is unnecessary to further analyze whether the alleged breaches of Article
III.2 can be considered as contractual violations rising to the degree of violations of the

Treaty.
C. ADMISSIBILITY OF THE CLAIMS

Jurisdiction being established, in the following section the Tribunal analyzes the
admissibility of Claimant's claims under the fork in the road clause and the waiting

period requirement under Article XI.1 and XI.2 of the Treaty.

1. FORUM SELECTION CLAUSE CONTAINED IN ARTICLE XI.3 OF THE TREATY

The existence of national courts and international arbitration as mechanisms for

resolving disputes can generate a significant risk of duplication of claims and a problem

429 Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Republic of Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on
Jurisdiction, January 14, 2004, § 52.

134

294.

295.

296.

297.

in determining what is the proper dispute resolution mechanism for disputes that may

arise during the investment period.

In order to avoid the duplication of procedures and claims, and therefore to avoid
contradictory decisions, Investment Treaties use two methods for limiting the selection
of a dispute resolution mechanism by the investor. The first method consists of
obligating the investor to select a dispute resolution mechanism ab initio through an
irrevocable option clause, usually called “fork in the road”, which implies that once one
of the routes is selected, the possibility of choosing the other is excluded. Under the
second method, based on the concept of waiver, once the investor chooses international
arbitration under the corresponding treaty, it must waive the exercise of any claim
before another dispute resolution mechanism, including those already initiated and

those it could initiate.

However, for the risk to be present, the disputes in both fora must be identical or have

a significant overlap for the forum selection clause to be applicable.

In this case, Article XI.3 of the Treaty establishes that if the investor submits the dispute
to the competent court of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was
made, it may bring a claim before an arbitral tribunal, provided the national court has
not issued a decision. Article X13 also establishes that the investor must adopt the

necessary measures to definitively withdraw from the ongoing judicial proceeding.“

The Tribunal considers that Article X1I.3 of the Treaty constitutes a forum selection
clause corresponding to the second method, a waiver clause, for limiting the selection
of dispute resolution mechanisms. Once an international arbitration is initiated, the

investor is thereby required to waive or withdraw from the actions it has initiated or

+80 Exhibit C-3, Article XL3 of the Treaty “3. Once an investor has submitted the dispute to an arbitral tribunal, the
avard shall be final. If the investor has submitted the dispute to a competent court of the Party in whose territory the
investment was made, it may, in addition, resort to the arbitral tribunals referred to in this article, if such national court

has not
permanently de

 

ed a judgment. In the latter case, the investor shall adopt any measures that are required for the purpose of

ting from the court case then underway.”

135

300.

301.

could initiate before national courts or an arbitral tribunal, in order to avoid conflicting

decisions and eliminate the possibility of obtaining double recovery for the same acts.

By analogy, regarding forum selection clauses, in SGS Société Générale de Surveillance
S.A. v. Republic of the Philippines, the arbitral tribunal decided that “... [t]he question is
whether a party should be allowed to rely on a contract as the basis of its claim when the contract
itself refers that claim exclusively to another forum. In the Tribunal’s view the answer is that it
should not be allowed to do so, unless there are good reasons, such as force majeure, preventing
the claimant from complying with its contract. This impediment, based as it is on the
principle that a party to a contract cannot claim on that contract without itself
complying with it, is more naturally considered as a matter of admissibility than
jurisdiction.” 31

[Emphasis added]

Additionally, it may be noted that the analogous rule of exhaustion of local remedies
normally concerns admissibility rather than jurisdiction in the strictest sense. The

Treaty requirement to submit a dispute to local courts is a question of admissibility of

 

claims, and not of jurisdiction.

The selection of the forum is a requirement for the validity and admissibility of the
claims of the Claimant in the arbitration, and therefore it is necessary to determine (i)
whether or not the Claimant submitted the dispute to a competent court in Costa Rica;
and, (ii) if it did, whether, once the arbitration initiated, Claimant took the necessary

measures to withdraw definitively from the judicial proceeding in progress.

In relation to the first aspect, that is, whether the Claimant submitted the dispute to a
competent court in Costa Rica, it is necessary to analyze the ordinary proceeding
initiated by Riteve on February 28, 2006 against the State before the Administrative

Contentious Court, a proceeding which Respondent considers to be a violation of the

 

481 $GS Société Générale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of the Philippines, 1CSID Case No. ARB/02/6, Decision on
Jurisdiction, January 29, 2004, § 154.

303.

304.

305.

forum selection clause. The Tribunal will have to determine subsequently if the actions

of Riteve can be considered to be a selection of forum attributable to SyC.

Such test was similarly outlined by the Tribunal in Alex Genin v. Estonia, when it stated
that “... the fundamental issue as regards the matter of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in this case
relates to whether the Claimants have submitted the dispute for resolution to the courts or
administrative tribunals of Estonia or in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed
dispute-settlement procedure. Two questions arise in this regard. First, to what extent were the
issues litigated in Estonia and the United States identical to those raised by the Claimants in
this arbitration? And second, is it proper to consider EIB and the Claimants as a ‘group’ and to

view EIB’s legal acts in Estonia as an ‘election of remedy’ for the group as a whole?”432

To elucidate these questions, the Tribunal must perform a general analysis of the
ordinary proceedings initiated by Riteve before the Administrative Contentious Court

against the State, represented by the Attorney General’s Office.

Such proceeding, registered as case file no. 06-000159-0163-CA and the joint proceeding
06-000384-0163-CA, were filed by Riteve SYC, S.A. against the State and the PTC, the

Comptroller appearing as coadjutor of the defendants.

In the claim related to case file no. 06-000384-0163-CA, Riteve requested the following:

a) To declare the nullity of Executive Order No. 30573-MOPT of July 10, 2002,

as contrary to law.

b) As aconsequence of this declaration, to declare valid and effective Executive
Orders No. 30185-MOPT, published in the Official Gazette No. 46 on March
6, 2002, and No. 30396-MOPT, published in the Supplement No. 51 of the
Gazette No. 134 on July 12, 2002.

306. For its part, in the claim related to case file 06-000159-0163-CA, Riteve requested the

following from the Tribunal:

a)

44 Exhibit RL-88.

To declare the nullity of the resolution contained in article 2.1 “Setting of
Technical Vehicle Inspection Rates for the 2005 Period”, adopted in the ordinary
meeting number 19-2004 of the Board of Directors of the PTC on December
15, 2004, and consider unlawful other acts both preparatory and final,

documents, reports and opinions attached and related that served as a basis.

To order the State to pay the present and future damages and lost profits
caused as a result of the issuance of the challenged act and the subsequent

applications thereof. Such claim was itemized by Riteve as follows:

i. Lost Profits: “... The amount Riteve failed to receive from January 1, 2005 to
December 31, 2005, as the difference between the established rate and that
which it would have received if the PTC and the [MPWT] had complied with
their contractual and constitutional obligations and had agreed to an increase

that would really guarantee the maintaining of the financial balance of the

contract; such as the one we requested by means of the petition dated
November 23, 2004. Said amount is estimated at two thousand two hundred
ninety-seven million four hundred twenty-nine thousand eight hundred
seventy-one and 00/100 colones (€2,297,429,871.00)...” #95

Material damages: “...The amount corresponding to the financial costs
(interest and exchange rate difference) deriving from the receipt of amounts
less than what it should have received during the period from January 1 to
December 31, 2005, according to the financial and economic balance the
contract must have. These costs add up to three hundred seventeen million
five hundred forty-three thousand sixty-four and 00/100 colones

(€317,543,064.00)...” 436

Non-pecuniary damages: ”... estimated at two hundred thirty-five million
twenty-seven thousand [sixty]-five and 00/100 colones (€253,027,065.00)

[sic] which shall be set in a timely manner by a mathematical actuary ...”°7

c) Order the State to pay legal interest on the amounts claimed, from the date

on which the final ruling is issued until the time of actual payment.

d) Declare that hereinafter the MPWT shall set the rates of the VTI service based

on the conditions and the rate model established in the Terms of the Tender,

the Consortium’s offer, and the Contract signed by the parties.

307. Those joined cases were resolved by the Administrative Contentious Court through

decision issued November 28, 2012, in which the action filed by Riteve was declared

invalid. The trial court decision was confirmed by an Appeals Court by a decision

issued on August 19, 2013. Against such ruling, Riteve filed a cassation appeal, which

the Supreme Court rejected by unanimous vote on December 5, 2013.

In order to determine whether the proceedings before the local tribunals relate to the
same dispute submitted to arbitration, the Tribunal will apply the fundamental basis of a

claim test, used in various cases, among them Pantechniki v. Albania.#38

In Pantechniki v. Albania, the tribunal held that ”...

 

i]t is common ground that the relevant
test is the one expressed by the America-Venezuela Mixed Commission in the Woodruff case
(1903): whether or not ‘the fundamental basis of a claim’ sought to be brought before the
international forum, is autonomous of claims to be heard elsewhere. This test was revitalized by
the ICSID Vivendi annulment decision in 2002. It has been confirmed and applied in many
subsequent cases. The key is to assess whether the same dispute has been submitted to both

national and international fora.” 89

Agreeing with the tribunal in Pantechniki v. Albania, the decisive factor to decide “...is

to determine whether claimed entitlements have the same normative source...” as in if a claim
“...truly does have an autonomous existence outside the contract...”# One can only consider
that the dispute submitted before the national tribunals is the same as the one submitted
to arbitration if both of them share the fundamental cause of the claim and seek for the

same effects.

Inasecond approach to the fundamental basis of a claim test, the tribunal shall consider
if the same claim is “on a different road.” In other words, whether a claim with the
same object, parties, and cause of action has already been brought before a different
judicial forum. Claims that arise out of a contract do not have the same cause of action

as Treaty claims. This requires differentiating between contractual and treaty claims.

Claimant has argued the dispute in this arbitration is different than the one submitted

before local courts for two main reasons: (i) a proceeding was filed before the

488 Pantechniki S.A. Contractors & Engineers v. Republic of Albania, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/21, Award, July 30,
2009 (Exhibit RL-63).

Administrative Contentious Court for nullifying administrative acts contrary to local
law, while the arbitral proceeding pertains to the breach of international obligations
under the Treaty; and, (ii) the claims in the local proceedings are related to annulments,

while the claims in the arbitration are related to compensation.

The Tribunal observes that while it is true that in the proceeding before the
Administrative Contentious Court the nullity of various administrative acts was
requested, the payment of damages and lost profits and a judicial declaration on the
manner in which the rates for the VTI services should be set were also requested. It is
also alleged that such damages and lost profits arise essentially from the presumed
breach by Costa Rica of its legal and contractual obligations, among others, to adjust

the rates.

In the arbitration, Claimant requested compensation for lost profits arising from
various acts and omissions by Costa Rica, the majority related to the adjustment of the

rates for the VTI service.

The Tribunal considers that the actions filed in the local proceeding and in the
arbitration share a fundamental normative source and pursue ultimately the same
purposes. The fundamental normative source is the same because compensation was
claimed for lost profits derived from the failure of Costa Rica to adjust the VTI service
rates according to what Claimant alleges was established in the Contract,
notwithstanding that the specific administrative acts alleged in each proceeding may

not be exactly the same.

Since the claims were all based on the violation of the Contract and share the same
normative source, based on the approach established in Pantechniki v. Albania, one can
conclude that the claims presented before local tribunals are the same as the ones
presented before this Tribunal. Even when applying the second approach directed to

distinguish between contractual and treaty claims, the conclusion remains the same.

142

317.

318.

319.

320.

321.

Moreover, the effects pursued in each proceeding are essentially the same, at least in
part, since while they differ in relation to the nullity claims, they coincide in relation to
the compensation claims, because Claimant seeks the payment of damages and lost

profits arising from the breach attributed to Respondent.

Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the claims of Claimant coincide. They consist of
the compensation for lost profits derived from the conduct or omissions of Costa Rica,
which are alleged in the local proceeding as violating national law, while in the
arbitration proceedings, the conduct of Costa Rica is alleged as contrary to the
provisions of Treaty. In both cases Respondent's acts are essentially qualified as illegal
because Claimant considers that the adjustment of rates was not done as agreed to in

the Contract.

In relation to the timing, it is important to have in mind that the claim before the local
courts was filed on February 28, 2006, while the Notice of Intent was not notified until
June 10, 2011 and the Request for Arbitration was filed on December 21, 2011. However,
in the judicial proceedings, damages and lost profits were claimed not only for those
generated up to the filing of the claim, but also for all those generated in the future.
Therefore, the coincidence of the claims is not just limited to the date of filing of the

claim, but also to all the subsequent claims that substantially share the same cause.

The Tribunal considers that even claims pertaining to Respondent’s conduct and
alleged omissions posterior to the filing of the claim before the Administrative
Contentious Court— provided they involve or are directly related to the adjustment of
the rates for the VTI service—should be considered to have been submitted to the local
court. Indeed, Claimant requested compensation not only for the lost profits already
incurred, but also for all those that may occur in the future as a result of the alleged

contractual breach of Costa Rica.

According to the standards established by the fundamental basis of a claim test, the
dispute submitted in the proceedings before the local tribunals and the one submitted
before this Tribunal coincide. The second step for the Tribunal is to determine whether

143

322.

323.

324.

325.

the dispute submitted before the local tribunals was submitted by Claimant in this

arbitration or by another entity.

The aforementioned proceedings before the local tribunals was filed by Riteve prior to
the initiation of the arbitration, but continued on different judicial instances and
reached the Supreme Court in parallel with the arbitration. At no time was the

withdrawal filed, neither by Riteve nor Claimant.

In order to determine if such proceedings constitute a breach of the forum selection
clause established in Article X1.3 of the Treaty, it is first necessary to analyze whether
Claimant submitted the dispute to local courts, or whether it was a different person not

controlled by the Claimant.

The proceeding before the Administrative Contentious Court was filed by Riteve SYC,
S.A., a Costa Rican company incorporated on February 8, 2001. Claimant holds 55% of
its capital. By Addendum No. 1 to the Contract executed on April 26, 2004, Riteve
acquired by assignment all the interest, rights and obligations held previously by the

Consortium.

The Tribunal considers that Riteve is a corporate vehicle that acts according to the

interests and instructions of Claimant, in view of the following:

a) Inthe Notification of Dispute made by Claimant to Costa Rica, SyC expressly
recognized that “...corporation SUPERVISION Y CONTROL S.A. is the owner
of 55% of the stock in corporation RITEVE S.A. and effectively controls it...” and
that “...ownership of 55% of the stock in corporation RITEVE, S.A. confirms as well
the control of the majority of stock by Supervision y Control that is its condition as

shareholder that controls the corporation ...” #1

441 Exhibit C-7 p. 6.

144

b)

a

d)

In its Memorial, SyC stated that “Riteve, SyC ... S.A. is effectively controlled by
society Supervision y Control S.A. because it still owns fifty-five percent (55%) of

the shares comprising its share capital.” 42

According to article 26 of the Corporate Bylaws of Riteve, “...the Board of
Directors will be composed of five members, who may or may not be partners of the
company and who will hold the positions of Chairman, Vice Chairman, Treasurer,
Secretary and Member. According to the current shareholding proportion, it will
correspond to SUPERVISION Y CONTROL, S.A. to elect three positions of the
board (Chairman, Treasurer and Member) and to TRANSAL, S.A. to elect the two

remaining positions (Vice Chairman and Secretary).” 43

No element was provided during the proceeding to show that the minority

shareholder, Transal, S.A., exercises control over Riteve.

326. Since Claimant is the majority shareholder of the capital stock of Riteve, it can designate

three of the five members of the Board of Directors that manage the company and has

powers to remove and give them instructions through the holding of a Shareholders

Meeting.

327. It also cannot be ignored that the Consortium assigned all its rights with respect to the

Contract to Riteve. SyC claims presumed violations by Costa Rica of its contractual

obligations, which in principle would only affect the legal sphere of the holder of the

Contract, which is Riteve. If the Claimant alleges that the effects suffered by Riteve

should be considered suffered directly by SyC, it cannot validly argue at the same time

that it is completely unrelated to a proceeding initiated by Riteve and that its interests

are not represented therein.

Indeed, this Tribunal finds that_there_is_a general presumption that_a_majority

shareholder also controls the company, and this presumption can only be rebutted if
there are special elements which create doubts about the owner's control.

For the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant controls Riteve, and that
the proceeding initiated by Riteve before the Administrative Contentious Court must

be considered filed by Claimant.

Article XI.3 of the Treaty requires the investor to select the forum in which it will process
its claim. Once it has selected arbitration, it must waive the exercise of its claims before
the local courts. In this case, Claimant submitted the dispute involving the
establishment of rates for the VTI service and the damages and lost profits derived from
the conduct and omissions of Costa Rica to the local courts, and failed to withdraw from
such proceeding once it initiated the arbitration. Therefore, the claims related to such
dispute are inadmissible. In any event, the Tribunal is of the view that the strict
application of the triple identity test (same parties; same object; and same normative
source) applied by some investment tribunals removes all legal effects from fork in the
road clauses, which contravenes the effet utile principle applicable to the interpretation
of treaties. What, in the end, matters for the application of fork in the road clauses is
that the two relevant proceedings under examination have the same normative source

and pursue the same aim. This is, in the Tribunal’s view, the case here.

As a result, the Tribunal concludes that, in view of Article XI.3 of the Treaty, all the
claims arising from the conducts or omissions of Costa Rica related to the establishment

of rates for the VTI service or the methodology for calculating them are inadmissible.

However, those claims that did not form part of the litis of the proceeding before the
Administrative Contentious Court are not affected by the declaration of inadmissibility
derived from Article X1.3 of the Treaty, since the forum selection clause only applies to

disputes processed in parallel in different forums.

146

333. SyC’s claims that do not refer to the adjustment of rates for the VTI service and the
damages and lost profits arising from the actions or omissions of Costa Rica in relation
to such adjustment and methodology cannot be considered submitted to the national

courts and therefore are, in principle, admissible.
334. From the analysis of the Memorials, documents, declarations, and statements of
Claimant, the Tribunal concludes that the claims unrelated to the establishment of rates

for the VTI service are the following:

a

Denial of justice for impeding, through a Ruling of the Supreme Court, that

the arbitration mechanisms agreed to in the Contract may be processed.“4

b) Giving a less favorable treatment to the investment of the Claimant in relation

to other investors in public services.

a

Reforming of the Transit Law in 2008 and 2012, affecting the exclusivity rights
granted to Claimant under the Contract, constituting in the opinion of

Claimant a measure tantamount to expropriation.“

d) Terminating the Contract through Ruling 333 of May 9, 2011, constituting in

the opinion of Claimant a measure tantamount to expropriation.“

335. Consequently, only these claims could be admissible in the arbitration, provided they

comply with the other requirements on admissibility.

44 [t should be pointed out that from the information provided by the Parties in relation to this claim, the
Tribunal observes that notwithstanding that the processing ofa local arbitration was not permitted, the Supreme
Court left open the possibility of going before the national courts to resolve the dispute between the Parties.

+45 In relation to such claim, it is important to have in mind that the Parties indicated that Riteve continues being
the sole provider of the VTI service in Costa Rica notwithstanding that Claimant alleges that the reforms to the
Transit Law deprived it of the rights of exclusivity.

446 With respect to this claim, the Tribunal observes from the information contributed by the Parties that Ruling
333 was revoked on June 15, 2012.

147

2. CONSULTATION AND WAITING PERIOD REQUIREMENT ESTABLISHED IN
ARTICLE XI.1 AND XI.2 OF THE TREATY

336. According to Article XI.1 of the Treaty, any dispute must be notified in writing by the
Investor to the host Party, including detailed information. The dispute notified can only
be sent to the competent local courts or an arbitral tribunal if a friendly settlement is not

reached within a term of 6 (six) months.#47

337. The purpose of this provision is for the parties to exhaust a friendly negotiation process
prior to initiating a judicial or arbitration proceeding, and it implies that before filing a
claim or a request for arbitration, the Investor must inform the State in reasonable detail

what conduct or omissions it considers are in violation of the Treaty.

338. In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal in Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of
Ecuador explains the purpose of this requirement: “...by imposing upon investors an
obligation to voice their disagreement at least six months prior to the submission of an
investment dispute to arbitration, the Treaty effectively accords host States the right to be
informed about the dispute at least six months before it is submitted to arbitration. The purpose
of this right is to grant the host State an opportunity to redress the problem before the
investor submits the dispute to arbitration. In this case, Claimant has deprived the host State

of that opportunity...” 448

339. Additionally, the Tribunal would like to remind the importance of proper notice, which
is an important element of the State's consent to arbitration. Indeed, proper notice

allows the State to examine and possibly resolve the dispute through negotiation.

447 Exhibit C-3, Article XI of the Treaty “1. Notice of any investment-related dispute arising between one of the parties
and an investor of the other Party with respect to matters governed by this Treaty shall be given in writing, including
detailed information, by the investor to the Party receiving the investment. To the extent possible, the parties to the dispute
shall try to settle such disputes by an amicable agreement.

2. If the dispute cannot be settled in such manner within a period of six months after the date of the written notice referred
to in Paragraph 1, the investor may submit the dispute:

@) to the competent courts of the Party in whose territory the investment was made;

b) to an international arbitral tribunal from among those cited below:

i) the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), created by the ‘Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States’, opened for signature on March 18, 1965, when each
State party to this Treaty adhered to such; ...”

2010, § 315 (Exhibit RL-14).

148

340.

341.

342.

The failure to duly notify the State receiving the investment of the existence of a dispute
constitutes a violation of Article XI.1 of the Treaty. This implies that any claim that has
not been notified is inadmissible in the respective proceeding, because the prior

negotiation process agreed to by the parties has not been exhausted.

In the event that the Investor notifies certain claims to the State, but upon presenting
the Request for Arbitration or its Claim Memorial it adds claims different and not
directly related to those previously presented, all the claims not notified will be
inadmissible. Thus, the proceeding will only address the previously notified claims

under the requirement set forth in Article XI.1 of the Treaty.

In this case, in the notice of the dispute by Claimant to Costa Rica, the following actions

of the Costa Rican State were indicated as cause of the dispute:

“a. Failure to give to the investment performed by Supervision y Control a fair

and equitable treatment guaranteeing its full protection.

b. Arbitrarily breaching its obligations with an investor and through which it was
obliged to approve tariff readjustments under the service contract for [V]ehicle

[T]echnical [I]nspections executed with corporation Riteve.

c. Abrogating through Executive Decree from the Ministry of Transportation the
tariffs readjusted which the Council for Public Transportation had approved to
make payments under the service contract for Vehicle [T]echnical [I]nspection

with corporation Riteve.
d. Failing to approve and publish in the Official Gazette, arbitrarily and unfairly

over more than eight years a procedure for tariff readjustment and the tariff

readjustments when it should have done so within a three month term.

149

e. Amend through a Resolution and against a contract the terms and conditions
agreed with the investor which precisely led it to perform significant capital

investments. .“449

343. Claimant alleged that such conduct and omissions by Costa Rica were contrary to
articles III, IV and V of the Treaty, in relation to the obligations of granting fair and
equitable treatment, full protection, national treatment and most favored nation

treatment, and the prohibition of nationalization and expropriation.

344. In its Memorial, Claimant expanded its claims, some of them being directly related to
the dispute notified to Respondent and others not. The claims coinciding with the

notice or directly linked to the issued raised therein, are the following:

a) Not granting at all times to SyC’s investment fair and equitable treatment by

seriously breaching obligations undertaken in the Contract.

b) Giving unjust and discriminatory treatment by not issuing a decision on the
request for rate readjustments, preventing SyC from fully enjoying its

investments.

Re

Violation of the obligation of granting at all times fair and equitable treatment
and full protection and security to SyC’s investment by repealing Executive
Order 30185-MOPT through which the methodology for the readjustment of
rates had been approved and published.

345. However, in its Claim Memorial, SyC added the following four claims that were not
mentioned in the Notice of Intent, nor are directly linked to the issues in the notification

made to Costa Rica:

449 Exhibit C-07.
150

346.

347.

348.

a

Denial of Justice in view of the fact that Ruling 000906-A-04 issued by the
Supreme Court on October 21, 2004, prevented the arbitration mechanism

agreed to in the Contract from being processed.

b) Measures tantamount to expropriation consisting of reforms to the Transit
law of 2008 and 2012, affecting the exclusivity rights granted to the Claimant

under the Contract.

c) Measures tantamount to expropriation consisting of having unilaterally
terminated the Contract through Ruling 333 of May 9, 2011, without ordering

the payment of prompt and adequate compensation.

d

Violation of the obligation to grant national treatment or most favored nation.
treatment with respect to what is granted to other investments in public

services.

The new claims not notified to Respondent nor directly related to those included in the
Notice of Intent are inadmissible in these arbitration proceedings because Claimant has
not complied with the aforementioned requirement established in Article XI.1 of the

Treaty.

The Tribunal observes that the claims duly notified to Costa Rica are precisely those
related to the adjustment of rates for the VTI service and the damages and lost profits
derived from the actions or omissions of Costa Rica in relation to such adjustment and
its methodology, which were already declared inadmissible because the respective

dispute has been submitted to the domestic courts.

Thus, all the claims of Claimant are inadmissible, in view of the fact that, as explained
before, some were already submitted to a local court, and those that are not considered
part of the dispute submitted to domestic courts were not duly notified to Costa Rica

as required by Article XIL.1 of the Treaty.

D. CONCLUSIONS ON JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

The Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction over this investment dispute, which
includes the power to decide over issues covered by Article III.2 of the Treaty. However,
the Tribunal finds that all the claims raised by Claimant are inadmissible. The Tribunal

thus finds no need to analyze the merits of the case.

All the claims related to the adjustment of rates for the VTI service and the methodology
for carrying it out, as well as the contractual breaches attributed to Costa Rica regarding
such questions and the damages and lost profits that may have been generated as a
consequence, are inadmissible under the forum selection clause contained in Article

X1.3 of the Treaty, because they have already been submitted to local courts.

All the claims asserted by Claimant in its Memorial that were not duly notified to
Respondent at least six months before the initiation of the arbitration are inadmissible
because the Claimant failed to comply with the requirement set forth in Article XI.1 of

the Treaty.
As a result, all of Claimant’s claims are inadmissible, either because of the forum
selection clause contained in Article X13 of the Treaty, or because of the failure to

comply with the notification requirement established in Article X11 of the Treaty.

The Tribunal therefore rejects all the claims presented by Claimant on the basis of

inadmissibility.

X. Costs

Claimant requested with its Memorial that Costa Rica be declared responsible for
breach of its obligations under the Treaty and in view thereof be ordered to pay all the

costs and expenses incurred for the arbitration, plus interest.

152

355. For its part, Costa Rica requested in its Counter-Memorial that Claimant be ordered to
pay all the procedural costs and the professional fees of the lawyers, plus the
compounded interest on these amounts. Furthermore, reiterating its request to the

Arbitral Tribunal in its Post Hearing Brief, Costa Rica argued that:

“., the deplorable conduct of the Claimant during the Hearing would by clearly
justify ordering payment of all costs and legal fees and expenses incurred by Costa
Rica in this arbitration. Costa Rica invites the Tribunal to consider, for example,
the reckless accusations and statements of the Claimant during the Hearing; the
abuse by the Claimant of the witnesses and experts of Costa Rica during the
Hearing; the fact that — on the few occasions it quoted a legal standard to support
general claims — the Claimant quoted the incorrect standard, only to then take it
back; the fact that the Claimant quoted portions of awards from other cases as if
they were judgments of the arbitral tribunal when in fact they were simply
narrations by the relevant tribunal [of] the allegations of the contending parties;
the fact that Claimant outright stated that there are no precedents to dismiss the
case on the grounds of given jurisdictional objections, when they do exist. These
are only some of examples; there are many more that will not be identified due to

lack of space.”450

356. In this respect, Costa Rica argues that the conduct of SyC is analogous to that of the
investor in the case Generation Ukraine, Inc. v. Ukraine, whose conduct led the arbitral

tribunal to order the investor to pay the costs.451

357. The Tribunal considers that notwithstanding that the claims of Claimant were
inadmissible in view of the terms of articles XI.1 and X13 of the Treaty, its arguments
were not frivolous, and therefore the Parties shall cover the costs of the arbitration in

equal parts and each of them will cover the processing costs they have incurred.
