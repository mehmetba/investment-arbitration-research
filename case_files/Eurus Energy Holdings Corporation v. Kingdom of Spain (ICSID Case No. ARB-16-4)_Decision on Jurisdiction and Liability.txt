' Request for Arbitr

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (‘ICSID’ or the ‘Centre’) on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty,
which entered into force for Spain on 16 April 1998 and for Japan on 21 October 2002
(the ‘ECT”),! and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States
and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the ‘ICSID

Convention’).
The Respondent is the Kingdom of Spain (‘Spain’ or ‘Respondent’).

Initially there were two Claimants, Eurus Energy Holdings Corporation (‘Eurus Japan’),
a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Japan,” and Eurus Energy
Europe BV (‘Eurus Europe’) a private limited liability company incorporated under the
laws of the Netherlands, wholly owned by Eurus Japan and itself the holder of shares and
other interests in 13 Spanish special purpose companies (‘SPC’) which own and operate
wind farms in Spain (the ‘Wind Farms’). As recited in paragraph 36 below, by Procedural
Order No. 4 of 11 June 2018, the Tribunal allowed Eurus Europe’s application to withdraw
from the arbitration on condition as to costs attributable to its participation. As a result, the

arbitration proceeded with Eurus Japan as sole Claimant.

The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to in this Decision as the
‘Parties’, and the term ‘Party’ is used to refer to either Claimant or Respondent.

The Parties’ current representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION

On 19 February 2016, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 17 February 2016,
together with exhibits C-0001 to C-0023 (the ‘Request for Arbitration’).

On 1 March 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration
and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the
Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as
possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of

Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the ‘ICSID Institution Rules’).

TRIBUNAL’S CONSTITUTION

The Parties agreed that the Tribunal would be constituted in accordance with Article
37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention and would consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by
each Party (‘Co-Arbitrators’), and the third arbitrator, the President of the Tribunal, to be

appointed by agreement of the Parties.

The Tribunal is composed of Judge James Crawford, an Australian national, President,
appointed by agreement of the Parties; Mr. Oscar M. Garibaldi, an Argentine and United
States national, appointed by Claimant; and Professor Andrea Giardina, an Italian national,
appointed by Respondent. Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated

to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

On 2 May 2016, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the
Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their
appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that

date.

24. On 8 February 2018, the Claimant submitted its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (‘Claimant’s
Rejoinder’), together with exhibits C-0482 to C-0485, and legal authorities CL-0094 to
CL-0111.

25. On 28 March 2018, the Claimant filed a request to introduce into the record the award
issued in Novenergia II — Energy & Environment (SCA) (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg),
SICAR v. Kingdom of Spain (SCC Arbitration 2015/063) (‘Novenergia II’) (CL-0112).
Additionally, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal order that ‘arbitral awards involving
Spain and relating to the Disputed Measures that might become publicly available before
the close of these proceedings can be submitted into the record without the need to follow

the procedure set out in Section 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1.’4

26. On 17 April 2018, Spain replied accepting the Claimant’s requests under certain conditions
and proposed to amend the procedure set out in Section 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1 to
incorporate legal authorities into the record. The Respondent also proposed to submit into
the record, among others, the Achmea judgment of the Court of Justice of the European

Union (‘CJEU’).>

27. On 27 April 2018, the Claimant filed a response to Spain’s letter of 17 April 2018.
The Claimant rejected Spain’s proposal, but it ‘agree[d] to the admission of the decision in
Achmea case.”°

4 Claimant’s letter of 28 March 2018.

> Slowakische Republik (Slovak Republic) v. Achmea BV, Case C 284/16, 6 March 2018 (‘Achmea’). The Claimant
accepted Respondent’s proposal to add to the record the CJEU’s Achmea judgment and the Tribunal permitted its
addition at {| 7 of Procedural Order No. 3 of 17 May 2018. Ultimately, however, neither Party submitted the Achmea
judgment as a numbered legal authority to the record. The Parties referred to the Achmea judgment (i) in subsequent
written submissions regarding the European Commission’s Application to participate as non-disputing party and
Respondent’s request to add into the record the Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member
States of 15 January 2019 on the legal consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on
investment protection in the European Union, (ii) in oral argument at the hearing on jurisdiction and merits, and
(iii) when commenting on many of the legal authorities added to the record after the hearing that referred to Achmea.

THE WITHDRAWAL OF EURUS EUROPE, THE HEARING ON JURISDICTION AND
THE MERITS

On 11 May 2018, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that Eurus Europe was to discontinue
its claims. On the same day, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on Eurus

Energy Europe B.V.’s withdrawal request by 16 May 2018.

On 17 May 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning the admission of
documentary evidence. In particular, Procedural Order No. 3 amended section 16.3 of
Procedural Order No. 1, incorporating Section 16.3.3.3 so as to allow a Party to submit into
the record awards or decisions that become public before the close of the proceedings and
that have been rendered in cases brought against Spain in the renewable energy sector.
In such case, the Party submitting the award was entitled to make comments of no more
than five pages and the other Party to submit a response of the same length. The Tribunal
also admitted into the record, inter alia, the award issued in Novenergia IT and the CJEU’s
decision in Achmea. Pursuant to this provision, a number of further decisions/awards were
submitted into the record and the Parties were afforded an opportunity to submit comments.

These comments have been duly taken into account in what follows.

On 18 May 2018, Spain submitted a response to the Claimant’s letter of 11 May 2018

concerning Eurus Energy Europe B.V.’s withdrawal request.

On the same day, 18 May 2018, the Claimant submitted a letter noting that the Tribunal
had instructed Spain to provide its comments on the discontinuance of Eurus Europe’s
claims by no later than close of business in Washington, D.C. on 16 May 2018.’ Since the
deadline had elapsed without a response from Spain, the Claimant argued that Spain had

‘acquiesced in the discontinuance’ .®

By letter of 21 May 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the issue of discontinuance
of claims would be discussed during the upcoming pre-hearing organizational

teleconference scheduled for 5 June 2018.

7 Communication from ICSID to the Parties of 11 May 2018.
8 Claimant’s letter of 18 May 2018.

33. On 22 May 2018, the Claimant submitted the award in Novenergia II and the award issued
by the tribunal in Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v. Kingdom of Spain (ICSID
Case No. ARB/14/1), dated 16 May 2018 (‘Masdar’) (CL-0113).

34. On 1 June 2018, the Respondent filed its comments on the Novenergia II award.”

35. A pre-hearing procedural teleconference was held on 5 June 2018, regarding the
organization of the hearing to be held from 18-21 and 23 July 2018, at the International

Chamber of Commerce (the ‘ICC’) in Paris, France.

36. On 11 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 on the withdrawal of Eurus
Energy Europe B.V.’s claims. In its Procedural Order No. 4, the Tribunal, after reciting the
positions of the Parties, noted that ICSID Rule 44, under which Eurus Europe had requested
the withdrawal of its claims, deals with the ‘discontinuance of the proceeding’, but that
Rule 44 is silent about partial discontinuance, such as when one party wishes to withdraw
all its claims, while the proceeding continues between the remaining parties in relation to
the remaining claims. The Tribunal held that it had discretion to allow partial
discontinuance, based on the authority that ICSID Convention Article 44 gives to tribunals
to decide questions that are not covered by the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the
parties. 10 As to the exercise of that discretion, the Tribunal considered that late withdrawal
of a party should not be permitted if the respondent objects and can demonstrate prejudice,
including the potential loss of a res judicata against the withdrawing party. On the other
hand, the late timing of Eurus Europe’s withdrawal had been explained by the Claimants
and by recent developments, in particular, the Achmea judgment of the CJEU and the ruling

of the Dutch tax authorities. Taking into account that allowing the withdrawal of Eurus

° Pursuant to Section 6 of Procedural Order No. 3 and amended paragraph 16.3.3.1 of Procedural Order No. 1,
the Parties had the opportunity to comment on the award issued in Masdar at the hearing on jurisdiction and merits.

Europe’s claims would simplify the proceedings, saving time and some costs, and that any
prejudice to the Respondent was largely notional because, in any event, the Claimants had
stated that they would not seek damages in favour of Eurus Europe, the Tribunal decided
to allow Eurus Europe’s withdrawal, subject to Eurus Japan’s undertaking to comply with

any order for the costs attributable to Eurus Europe’s involvement in this arbitration.!!

On 12 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 reflecting the Parties’
agreements and the Tribunal’s decisions on procedural matters concerning the organization
and logistical arrangements of the hearing to be held from 18-21 and 23 July 2018, at the

ICC in Paris, France.

On 12 July 2018, the Claimant submitted two awards as new legal authorities: Antin

On 5 November 2018, the European Commission filed an Application for Leave to
intervene as a Non-Disputing Party pursuant to Rule 37(2) dated 29 October 2018
(the ‘European Commission’s Application’). The Commission sought leave to intervene
on the applicability of Article 26 of the ECT to intra-EU disputes and on EU law on state

aid as applicable law to the merits precluding an award on damages against Spain.

On 6 November 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit comments on the European

Commission’s Application by 13 November 2018.

Commission’s Application, supporting the Application on grounds of its materiality to the

On 28 November 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was minded to grant
conditional leave to the European Commission’s Application confined to the issue of state
aid as a substantive matter. The Tribunal invited the Parties to submit further comments on
the European Commission’s Application on the substantive issue of state aid by

5 December 2018.

The Centre received the Claimant and Respondent’s comments, respectively, on 4 and 5

December 2018.

On 21 December 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 on the European
Commission’s Application. The Tribunal granted the European Commission leave to file
by 17 January 2019 a written submission on the issue of state aid. The written submission
was subject to a number of conditions, including that the Commission submit by 4 January
2019 ‘a written undertaking that it will comply with any decision on costs ordered by the

Tribunal and attributable to its intervention’ (the ‘Undertaking on Costs’).

On 4 January 2018, the European Commission submitted a Request to alter the Tribunal’s
Procedural Order No. 6 dated 21 December 2018 (the ‘European Commission’s
Request’). The Commission requested that the Tribunal remove the condition of the
Undertaking on Costs, or alternatively, that its Application for Leave to Intervene be

admitted into the record instead of its proposed submission.

On 9 January 2019, following an invitation from the Tribunal, each Party submitted

observations on the European Commission’s Request.

On 16 January 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 on the European
Commission’s Request. The Tribunal rejected the Commission’s request to waive the
condition of an Undertaking on Costs but granted the Commission’s request to introduce
into the record the European Commission’s Application instead of its proposed submission.
The Tribunal invited the Parties to submit by 31 January 2019 further comments on the

Commission’s Application on the issue of state aid.

On 17 January 2019, the European Commission informed the Tribunal that it was not ina
position to comply with the Undertaking on Costs and that it would not file a written

submission.

Meanwhile, on 25 January 2019, the Respondent filed a request to introduce into the record
as an additional legal authority a Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of
the Member States of 15 January 2019, on the legal consequences of the judgment of the
CJEU in Achmea and on investment protection in the European Union. The declaration
was signed by 22 EU Member states. The Respondent argued that the Declaration

‘addresses many of the same issues relating to Spain’s intra-EU jurisdictional objection.’

On 31 January 2019, the Parties filed their respective comments on the European
Commission’s Application on the issue of state aid. These arguments are dealt with in

substance below.

On 4 February 2019, the Claimant filed its objections to the Respondent’s request, arguing
that the Declaration would be irrelevant because there is ‘no European claimant in this

case, and no intra-EU jurisdictional objection’.

On 7 February 2019, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent’s request, observing inter alia
‘that the Declaration is not unanimous and only deals with intra-EU disputes. On this basis,
the Tribunal is of the view that the Declaration is not of such nature as to constitute a

decisive factor in the Tribunal’s decision.’

LEGAL AUTHORITIES ADDED POST-HEARING

On 13 February 2019, Mr. McGowan sent to the Parties and the Tribunal the final versions

Parties from submitting any comments. The Claimant also requested that the Tribunal
direct the Respondent to submit existing awards from arbitrations related to its renewable
energy regime and to continue to submit such awards until the Tribunal should indicate
otherwise. The Claimant indicated that it was aware of further awards and decisions issued
in such cases that had not been made public.'* On 3 May 2019, the Tribunal admitted the

the ‘Intra-EU’ Jurisdictional Objection of the tribunal Landesbank, dated 25 February 2019
(CL-0118), which had become public. The Claimant also requested that the Tribunal

suggested that further comments on the award and other decisions were not necessary.
On 9 March 2020, the Respondent indicated that it did not oppose the suggestion of the
Claimant, but added that it wished to submit the award rendered in the PV Investors v.
Kingdom of Spain with comments, unless the Tribunal were to decide that there was no
need for such comments from either Party. On 10 March 2020, the Claimant responded
that it did not object to Spain’s submitting the PV Investors v. Spain award to the record
but that it did not believe that comments on this award by the Parties were warranted. On
12 March 2020, the Tribunal thus admitted the award in SolEs v. Spain and the award in

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The factual background below contains a summary of relevant facts, some of which are
disputed between the Parties. This summary does not seek to include all the facts submitted
in this proceeding and is without prejudice to the full factual record that has been

considered by the Tribunal.

THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SYSTEM AND THE SPECIAL REGIME

Spain characterizes the Spanish electricity system (‘SES’) as ‘an economic, technical and
legal system’ comprising the ‘set of activities aimed at ensuring the supply of electricity in
the Spanish territory.’?” The main objective of the SES is to ensure that all consumers have
access to electricity in conditions of equality and quality, with electricity produced at the

lowest possible cost while having regard to environmental protection.”*

Spain explains that participation in the SES is provided for in regulations, which should be
understood having regard to the hierarchy of norms within the Spanish legal system.
In descending order, these are: The Constitution, Laws, Royal Decree-Laws, Royal
Decrees, and Ministerial Orders, subject to the qualification that EU law is part of the
Spanish legal system and its implementation is subject to the ultimate jurisdiction of the

European courts.”

The EU policy on energy and environment, aligned with the Kyoto Protocol,” sets targets

that Spain, as a member state, is required to meet.*! Spain contends that Directive

2001/77/EC® recognized the need to provide state aid to renewable energy (‘RE’) in

accordance with Community guidelines on state aid for environmental protection.**

In the interpretation of the European Commission, such state aid is intended to cover the
difference between the cost of producing energy and the market price, including a fair
return on capital. But such state aid should not give rise to over-remuneration.*
The Claimant disagrees with Spain’s reference to the 2001 Directive, which creates the
impression that the regime established under RD 2818/1998 (under which the Claimant
made part of its investment) was limited in time as financial incentives were set to cease

once an alleged reasonable return was reached.*>

The generation of electricity from RE sources was regulated in Law 40/1994,°°
implemented by RD 2366/1994,*’ of 9 December 1994. The Parties agree that Law
40/1994 set out a two-tiered system with an ‘Ordinary Regime’ and a ‘Special Regime’ of
remuneration and that Law 54/1997,*8 enacted in November 1997, maintained this two-
tiered system.*? The Claimant explains that in this two-tiered system, Special Producers
classified as ‘ordinary’ were subject to a free market pricing system (i.e. required to sell
their energy on the market through a pooling system) and Special Producers qualifying for
the Special Regime, including the Wind Farms, were entitled to receive additional

remuneration.*° In particular, Law 54/1997, section 30(4) set out criteria for the

* RL-0015, Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the
promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal market in electricity, published in the

determination of premiums ‘so as to achieve reasonable profitability rates with reference

to the cost of money on capital markets.”4!

Spain submits that the Special Regime, created with RD 2366/1994, is based on the
principle of reasonable return. A reasonable rate of return involves receiving revenues
sufficient to recover the investment costs, operating costs, and make a return in line with
market criteria. The methodology involves (i) a standard facility, recognizing and
reconstructing an economic operating structure, identifying the investment, operating and
maintenance costs according to market criteria and with the performance of a ‘diligent
investor’ and (ii) setting a target for the economic return for a given period of time, which
is dynamic, balanced and proportionate, in accordance with the capital market. This target
should be achieved through the sum of a) the market price and b) subsidies. Spain submits
that it has historically used this methodology in its Plans for Promotion of Renewable

Energies (“PFER’) of 1986,*2 1989,*3 2000-2010" and 2005-2010.45

Spain explains that until 1997, the SES was a regulated system, in which the government
established the price of electricity and compensated the electricity producers for the costs
of generation, transmission, and distribution. Law 54/1997 began to deregulate the SES as
a result of EU requirements to encourage competition and the efficiency of the electricity

sector.*©

Spain argues that the Tribunal should analyse the changes introduced to the SES taking

into account the principle of economic sustainability. That principle justifies the regulatory

id translation, and notes that the translation corresponds to Law 54/1997 as amended by Law 17/2007 of 4 July

2007 and Royal Decree 7/2006 of 23 June 2006. In what respects to Art. 30(4) on the determination of the premiums,

intervention in the income and costs of the SES, including the costs of subsidizing RE.*”
This intervention, however, is limited to ensuring RE producers a reasonable return
according to the cost of money in the capital market, pursuant to Article 30(4) of Law
54/1997.** This return, Spain argues, was linked to the construction and operating costs of

the plants.”

103. The meaning of the standard of ‘reasonable profitability rates’ (or what Spain in its
submissions calls ‘reasonable rate of return’) in Law 54/1997 and subsequent regulation is
an important point of controversy. The Claimant disagrees with Spain’s proposition that
the inclusion of the language ‘reasonable profitability’ in Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997 has
the meaning that Spain now wishes to attribute to it, i.e. that incentives for existing facilities
were always subject to an undefined cap to keep them consistent with said language. For
the Claimant, a guarantee of a reasonable rate of profitability means that minimum levels

of profitability were to be assured, not that profitability would be capped.*°

104. The Claimant notes that years later when Spain used the language ‘reasonable rate of
return’ in an implementing regulation, namely, in Article 44(3) of Royal Decree 661/2007
(‘RD 661/2007’)°! which governs the conditions for updating and review of incentives
available to special procedures, said provision expressly clarified that revisions would not

apply to existing facilities:

(PER) 2005-2010, and of the Energy Efficiency and Savings
Strategy in Spain (E4), together with such new targets as may be
included in the subsequent Renewable Energies Plan 2011-2020,
there shall be a review of the tariffs, premiums, supplements and
lower and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree with regard to
the costs associated with each of these technologies, the degree of
participation of the special regime in covering the demand and its
impact upon the technical and economic management of the system,

The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits
indicated in this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the
deed of commissioning shall have been granted prior to 1 January
of the second year following the year in which the revision shall
have been performed.>*

105. For the Claimant, the inclusion of what it characterizes as a ‘stabilization clause’ in Article
44(3) of RD 661/2007 immediately after the discussion of guaranteeing reasonable rates of
profitability according to the cost of money in the capital markets, is explained by the fact
that if Spain had said in Law 54/1997 that overall investments were subject to an undefined
cap on investment returns, Spain simply would not have attracted the investment it hoped
to attract. The Claimant would not have invested in Spain, much less expanded its

investment over the years.**

106. The Claimant also supports its position on the meaning of ‘reasonable rate of return’
referring to the language of Article 36 of RD 661/2007, regulating the relationship between
the remuneration to receive and the passage of time. The Claimant notes that the regulated
tariff would be maintained at one level for 15 years, and then reduced but still available
‘thereafter.’ The use of the word ‘thereafter,’ the Claimant submits, means an indefinite
period, without any indication that the incentives would be capped once the facility had

reached a target rate of return.**

107. In December 1998, Spain enacted RD 2818/1998 which implemented Law 54/1997.
Under Article 18 of RD 2818/1998, Special Producers were entitled, among other things:
[To] [t]ransfer to the system through the electricity distribution

company their output or surpluses of electricity provided that it is
technically possible for them to be absorbed into the network and to

receive for it the wholesale market price plus the incentives provided

for in the economic arrangements made under this Royal Decree.>°
108. RD 2818/1998, like RD 2366/1994, provided that Ordinary and Special Regime producers
should register in an administrative registry, later denominated the Administrative Record
of Electricity Production Facilities ((RAIPRE’).*° The Parties disagree on the legal
consequences of registration. Spain contends that the creation of the RAIPRE shows the
intention of the regulator to monitor compliance with the targets set out in Spain’s energy
plants.*” The Claimant argues that registration in RAIPRE entitled Special Producers to
certain incentives, as set out in Article 23 of RD 2818/1998, subject to modification every

four years based on defined criteria.**

109. In particular, RD 2818/1998 set out a feed-in tariff (‘FIT’) to be calculated using market
prices as a base with a premium to be added. The premium for wind power facilities with
less than 50 MW installed capacity was 5.26 pesetas per kWh, which, combined with the
market price, would be the price that Special Producers could receive. Special Producers
were also given the option to receive a fixed rate of 11.02 pesetas per kWh. As noted, the

premiums would be subject to review every four years.

110. The listed criteria to be applied in the quadrennial review of premiums did not include
‘a quantitative limit on the amount of remuneration a facility could receive.*? Spain
contends, however, that since the premiums were subject to review, ‘no investor could
undertake an investment trusting in the grandfathering of the remunerative regime

established by RD 2818/1998.’

111. In 1999 Spain approved the PFER 2000-2010,°! which established the economic conditions
and methodologies to determine the remuneration of the Special Regime. The Plan defined

for each RE technology different ‘standard facilities’. Each standard facility was subject to

standards of investment costs, operating costs, useful life, hours of rewarded production,
and market price. The Respondent contends that, applying that methodology, a standard
facility would reach within its useful life a reasonable rate of return, according to the cost

of money in the capital market."

112. In 2002, Spain enacted RD 1432/2002. According to the Claimant, the preamble of
RD 1432/2002 expressly acknowledged the importance of ‘send[ing] out signals of
stability’ to prospective investors.~ Spain explains that the tariff or the premium and the
incentive, depending on the case, consisted of a multiple of the average electricity tariff
(‘TMR’). The TMR, or what Claimant’s describes as the ‘reference tariff’ was defined in
RD 1432/2002. Article 4 of RD 1432/2002 provided for the reference tariff to be
calculated according to a formula that took into account various costs and considerations.
For the Claimant, the relevance of RD 1432/2002 was that it stabilized the calculation of

incentives under the Special Regime by anchoring them to the TMR or ‘reference tariff.’°°

113. In 2004, Spain enacted RD 436/2004.% Article 22 of that RD provided Special Producers
with the option of (i) selling RE electricity at a regulated tariff or (ii) selling RE electricity
at the market price, receiving the pool price and an additional premium and an incentive
for each sale. For wind power facilities with installed capacities above 5 MW the premium
and incentive were fixed at 40% and 10%, respectively. The Claimant describes

RD 436/2004 as ‘further improv[ing] the remuneration scheme for [RE] facilities.’

114. Spain contends that, subject to the principle of economic sustainability and reasonable
return, RD 436/2004 repealed RD 2818/1998 to achieve by 2011 the objectives of the
PFER.” Accordingly, RD 436/2004 fixed the subsidies using the calculation methodology

set out in the PFER to grant producers a reasonable rate of return with reference to a

standard facility, but did not grant an indeterminate profitability.”” The Claimant disagrees
with this reading of RD 436/2004, as its preamble ‘guarantees the operators of special
regime facilities reasonable remuneration for their investments.””! In Claimant’s view
‘[i]t would not make sense to describe “reasonable remuneration” as a “guarantee” if it had

in fact been an upper limit.’”*

Under RD 436/2004, wind producers could annually choose between (i) a fixed tariff
calculated as a percentage of the TMR (‘Fixed Tariff’) and (ii) the pool price plus a
premium and an incentive (‘Premium Option’). Further, Spain explains that the premium
given to RE installations under RD 436/2004 was a percentage of the TMR. This meant
that, if the installed power increased, the costs associated with the production of RE subject
to the Special Regime also increased. This led to an increase of the TMR,” which led in
turn to an increase in the Special Regime production costs, because the tariffs and
premiums were a percentage of the TMR. RD 436/2004 thus ‘caused perverse effects for
the sustainability of the SES.’”* Among other factors, an increase in oil prices caused an
increase in the price of energy as high as 50-60 Euros/MW. This led to a situation where
most facilities opted for remuneration according to the market price plus a premium,
obtaining much higher returns than those envisaged by the regulator.” This situation led
to the approval of RD-Law 7/2006, the preamble of which highlighted the inefficiency of

the then-current remuneration system.’®

In 2005, Spain revised the PFER by adopting the PFER 2005-2010, which used the same
methodology as the PFER (with reference to standard facilities) to calculate subsidies

necessary to cover the investment and operating costs and to reach a return on the project

close to 7% before tax through a useful life set for wind farms at 20 years.’” Spain contends

that the RE sector was aware of the profitability limits set by this methodology.”*

117. In 2007, Spain enacted RD 661/2007, implementing RD-Law 7/2006. The Claimant
characterizes RD 661/2007 as the final update of the Special Regime before the Disputed
Measures.” Spain characterizes it as a measure ‘to eliminate the perverse effect that the

previous system, based on the TMR, produced for the SES’ economic sustainability.’®°

118. Under Article 24 of RD 661/2007, Special Producers could sell their energy in the pool
market and then receive an additional premium, or they could opt to receive a fixed
regulated tariff. The incentives available to wind power producers would be updated
annually according to the national retail price index (‘RPI’),*! instead of the TMR.*?
Article 27(2) set a ‘reference premium’ to which the premiums to be determined would be
tethered, so that future premiums would fall within a predefined range, depending on the

type of facility in question.*?

119. | Spain explains that, for wind technologies, the First Transitional Provision of RD 661/2007
established a transitional period until 31 December 2012. That is, the wind facilities that
had opted under RD 436/2005 to sell electricity at a market price plus a premium would
continue to receive premiums based on that method until 31 December 2012, but with
premiums not updated after 2006 (because RD-Law 7/2006 froze the updating of premiums
under the TMR). Thereafter, they would be subject to RD 661/2007.**

B. CLAIMANT’S DECISION TO INVEST

120. The Claimant began its development and investment in Spain’s RE in 1997, as one of the

enterprise divisions of Tomen Corporation (‘Tomen’), now Toyota Tsusho Corporation.®>

The Claimant, Eurus Japan, is Tomen’s power business branch. Eurus Japan is 60% owned

by Toyota Tsusho Corporation and 40% by Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, Inc.
(‘TEPCO’).*°

121. The Claimant’s investment in Spain consists of shares in 13 SPCs,*” held indirectly through

its wholly owned subsidiary, Eurus Europe. These SPCs in turn own and operate

21 different wind projects in Galicia and Asturias:

Eos Pax IIa SL (projects Paxareiras I and IIA, both approved on 7 March 1997),

Parque Eélico de Barbanza SA (project Barbanza, approved on 7 March 1997),

Parque Eélico de Vicedo SL (project Vicedo, approved on 5 September 1997),

Parque Eélico de A Ruiia SL (project Paxareiras II F, approved on 17 July 1998),

Parque Eélico de Virxe do Monte SL (project Paxareiras II C, approved on 17
July 1998),

Parque Eélico de Ameixenda Filgueira SL (Paxareiras II D & E, approved on 10
August 2000),

Parque Eélico de Adrafio SL (project Paxareiras II B, approved on 9 May 2001),

Parque Eélico de Curras SL (Paxareiras II F+, approved on 9 May 2001),

85 In its Memorial, the Claimant recounts that in 1992, when Eurus was still part of Tomen’s power business, Tomen

partnered with SeaWest Espaifia, the Spanish subsidiary of SeaWest, a United States company spe

 

alizing in wind

 

power. Tomen and SeaWest Espaiia set out to explore the Spanish wind industry with focus on sites in Galicia and
Asturias. See Cl. Mem., {{[ 49, 50, 54.

. Parque Eélico de Deva SL (project Deva, approved on 18 February 2002),
. Parque Eélico de Tea SL (project Tea, approved on 18 February 2002),

. Parques Edlicos de Buio SL (projects Buio, Rioboo, Gamoide, all approved on 25
February 2005, projects Fonteavia and Bidueiros, both approved on 26 December
2005), and

. Parque Edlico de Abara SL (projects Alto de Abara, approved on 24 May 2006,
and Grallas, approved on 22 February 2008).

Claimant’s indirect shareholding in the SPCs is shared with the Spanish conglomerate

Acciona S.A. (‘Acciona’).°®

Although wind power offers certain benefits compared to fossil-fuel energy generation
methods, wind power is expensive to produce because of its substantial construction
costs.*” Hence, according to the Claimant, governments like Spain have often provided
incentives to render wind power a competitive investment option for energy producers.
FITs enable energy producers to receive payment for the energy generated, taking into
account the producer’s costs, rather than solely the market price for electricity. FITs allow
energy production methods that have higher costs, like wind power, to achieve predictable
and stable profitability.°° The Claimant alleges that Spain’s special incentives, including

FITs, were the primary reason why the Claimant invested in Spain.?!

The Claimant explains that in the process of making and expanding its investment in Spain,
it followed internal protocols called in Japanese the ringi system, materialized in a

comprehensive document called ringi-sho, to evaluate potential investment opportunities

128.

and to decide whether to proceed with them. The Claimant followed the ringi system before
committing to investing in each of its wind farms in Spain, and also consulted external

financial advisors.°”

In 1994, Spain enacted Law 40/1994, implemented by RD 2366/1994, creating a Special
Regime for RE energy producers, which adopted differential tariff levels taking into

account the specific conditions of RE producers.”

In 1995, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of Galicia (‘Xunta’) published a plan to
allow the development of 2.550 MW of wind power in Galicia. Galicia called for interested
investors to submit development plans. In January 1996, Galicia approved the development
plan submitted by SeaWest Espafia, which had set out its intention of partnering with

Tomen.™

In March 1996, the then President of the Xunta visited Japan, where it met representatives
from Tomen at the Spanish Embassy in Tokyo. In his witness statement, Mr. Matsuoka
affirms that the President of the Xunta guaranteed that Galicia would actively support wind
power investment.” The Parties disagree about the value that is to be given to the alleged
assurances of the President of the Xunta. Spain argues that this official, as a representative
of an Autonomous Community, had no competence to create obligations of Spain regarding

the SES.°°

In July 1996, Tomen and SeaWest Espaiia entered into a Joint Development Agreement to
conduct their business in Spain through the joint venture company EuroVento SL

(‘EuroVento’).

In February 1997, the Xunta granted Special Producer status to EuroVento for its first
project under the development plan. This status qualified EuroVento to receive the benefits

of the Special Regime. In March 1997, the Xunta granted administrative authorization for

EuroVento’s project. In May 1997, financial advisors commissioned by SeaWest Espaiia
and Tomen issued a preliminary financial memorandum to attract financing for the project.
The memorandum set out the advisor’s independent view of the Special Regime, stating
that ‘a major adverse change in the Government’s policy towards renewable energy

generally, and wind energy in particular, is highly unlikely in the foreseeable future.’?”

129. The Claimant says that the Special Regime was the primary reason for Tomen to decide to
invest in Spain, with the expectation that Spain’s commitments to the promotion of RE was
reliable and durable. The Claimant further states that, even if Spain were to change the
Special Regime, the Claimant expected that those changes would not retroactively affect
existing wind power plants.°* In March 1997, Tomen decided to invest in Spain, in what

became the Paxareiras I and II A wind power facilities.”

130. Between 1997 and 2008, the Claimant made a series of investments, in each case through
Eurus Europe, in Spanish wind farms.! In all but two cases, Eurus’s interest in the
operating SPCs was 50%; in one it was 12.5%; in another, it was 48.5%. These investments
were approved and made under the auspices of successive Spanish laws (Law 40/1994,
replaced by Law 54/1997) and Royal Decrees (RD 2366/1994; RD 2818/1998; RD
436/2004; and RD 661/2007). The Parties dispute the impact of these various changes, and
the Tribunal will return to that issue in due course. But despite these fluctuations, the
Special Regime instituted by these laws and decrees retained the character of a system in
which the remuneration of renewable energy producers included a subsidy over the market

price.

131. Starting in 2005, however, the SES began to show an increasing deficit, which over time
grew substantially. By 2013, the accumulated deficit was almost EUR 30 billion.'°! The
Parties disagree on the causes of the deficit. The Respondent takes the view that the main

cause of the deficit was the extent of subsidies payable to producers under the Special

Regime. The Claimant contends that the main cause was Spain’s reluctance to transfer to
consumers the full cost of the system. Whatever the causes, the accumulated deficit and
other factors would lead in 2012-2014 to a significant change in Spanish policy with regard

to the calculation of subsidies.!”

What the Claimant describes as a ‘temporary precursor’? to this overhaul was
RD 1614/2010, which imposed production limits on and temporarily reduced incentives
for, inter alia, wind power facilities.!°° Under Article 2 of RD 1614/2010, the energy
produced above specified limits would not qualify for financial incentives. In relevant part,
Article 2(4) provided:

4. For wind technology facilities on land, the number of benchmark

equivalent hours will be 2,589 hours/year when, in a calendar year,

the median annual operational hours of all the wind technology

facilities on land with a definitive registration [...] exceed 2,350
hours/year.

For facilities registered definitively in the administrative Register of

production facilities operating under the special system [...] on 7

May 2009 [...] the benchmark values for annual equivalent hours,

2,350 and 2,589 hours/year, cannot be revised during their

operational life.
Spain explains that RD 1614/2010 was adopted to guarantee the economic sustainability
of the SES and resolve certain inefficiencies regarding wind and other technologies, as
stated in its preamble.'™ In Spain’s view, this showed that RE producers were aware that
the economic sustainability of the SES could prompt changes affecting existing facilities.
Also, energy sector associations had urged the adoption of measures to reform the Special

Regime.!°

According to the Claimant, RD 1614/2010 did not have a significant effect on its

investment.!°°

THE DISPUTED MEASURES

Between 2012 and 2014, Spain enacted what the Claimant characterizes as the ‘Disputed
Measures,’ which, the Claimant argues, drastically overhauled the Special Regime, in

breach of Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT.!”

(1) Law 15/2012

In 2012, Spain enacted Law 15/2012.'°8 Article 8 of that law introduced a 7%
environmental tax (‘TVPEE’) on the production of energy, applicable to all energy
generators including but not limited to RE producers. The Parties disagree as to the
characterization of the TVPEE. Spain sees it as a domestic taxation measure, within the
meaning of Article 21 of the ECT, of general application to both ordinary and RE producers
with the purpose of raising state revenue.'” The Claimant sees it as a disguised tariff cut

particularly affecting RE producers, and argues that it was not a bona fide tax.'!°

Law 15/2012 permitted ordinary energy producers to set their own prices when selling
energy to the pool market, enabling them to pass the cost of the 7% tax to the buyers
(consumers). But Law 15/2012 required RE producers to sell to the pool at a price of zero
and then to receive remuneration through a regulated formula, based on the average market
price and a regulated tariff. Under such a formula, the regulated tariff decreases as the
average pool market price increases, that is, the remuneration to RE producers does not

increase if the average pool price increases.!!!

(2) RD-Law 2/2013
In February 2013, Spain enacted RD-Law 2/2013!! eliminating the payment of premiums
and leaving RE producers only with the option of a regulated tariff. RD-Law 2/2013 also

introduced an adjusted CPI before tax, which did not account for tax increases or the cost

introduced by RD-Law 2/2013 were aimed at avoiding distortions in the CPI unrelated to

the economy and were endorsed by the rules and criteria of the EU.!!*

(3) RD-Law 9/2013

In July 2013, Spain enacted RD-Law 9/2013,!!5 which replaced the incentive system, based
on levels of financial support per MWh produced, with a remuneration system based on
(i) pre-tax target returns based on the average yield on 10-year Spanish Treasury bonds and
(ii) costs, revenues, and investment of an efficient and well-managed installation. This
remuneration system would be revised every 6 years. RD-Law 9/2013 modified Article
30(4) of Law 54/1997, to regulate the compensation for an ‘efficient and well-managed

(4) Law 24/2013

In December 2013, Spain enacted Law 24/2013,'"” which repealed Law 54/1997 (but for a
few provisions), and abolished the distinction between the Ordinary and Special Regimes.
The Claimant argues that by repealing the legal framework under which all RE installations
were operating and eliminating the two-tiered system, the Special Regime was

abolished.!!®

In June 2014, Spain enacted RD 413/2014,!!” which set a methodology to reach the new

specific remuneration would depend on the number of annual operating hours assigned for

D. THE DISPUTED MEASURES AND SPANISH COURTS DECISIONS

143. From 2005 onwards, the Spanish Supreme Court issued a number of decisions on appeals
brought against various royal decrees that modified features of the Special Regime. Spain
submits that the Supreme Court is the ultimate interpreter of the Spanish legal system and
no diligent investor could ignore its case-law.'?° In its submissions, Spain frequently relied,

inter alia, on:

IV. THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF
144. The Claimant’s request for relief is formulated in its Reply as follows:

431. Eurus seeks the following relief:
(a) a declaration that Spain has breached the ECT;

(b) a declaration that each such breach by Spain has caused harm to
Eurus by diminishing the value of its wind power investment in
Spain’s territory;

(c) an award of damages (including appropriate interest and
gross-up for taxes) to compensate Eurus for the loss it has suffered
as a result of Spain’s breaches of the ECT;

(d) an award of its costs of the arbitration, on a full indemnity basis;

(e) an award of interest on sums awarded up to the date of payment;
and

(f) such other relief as the Tribunal determines to be appropriate.

432. Eurus reserves the right to amend and/or supplement the relief
sought. Eurus also reserves the right to apply for interim or
interlocutory relief should it consider such action necessary.!**

145. The Respondent, in turn, requests in its Rejoinder:

896. In view of the arguments set forth in this Memorial, the
Kingdom of Spain respectfully requests the Arbitral Tribunal to:

131 R.0154, Judgment of the Constitutional Court, 17 December 2015 (Appeal Inc. 5347/2013); RL-0242 (English

a) Declare that there is no jurisdiction to hear the complaints of the
Claimant or, where appropriate, the inadmissibility thereof, in
accordance with what is stated in section III of this Memorial,
related to Preliminary Objections;

b) In the alternative, in the event that the Arbitral Tribunal decides
that it does have jurisdiction to hear the present dispute, that it
dismiss all the Claimant’s claims on the merits, due to the fact that
the Kingdom of Spain has not breached in any way the ECT, in
accordance with what is stated in sections IV and V of this
Memorial, referring to the Facts and the Merits of the Case,
respectively;

c) Furthermore, all claims for compensation of the Claimant should
be dismissed as they are not entitled to compensation in accordance
with section VI of this Memorial; and

d) Orders the Claimant to pay all costs and expenses derived from
this arbitration, including ICSID administrative expenses,
arbitrators’ fees, and the fees of the legal representatives of the
Kingdom of Spain, their experts and advisors, as well as any other
cost or expense that has been incurred, all of this including a
reasonable interest rate from the date on which those costs are
incurred and the date of their actual payment.

897. The Kingdom of Spain reserves the right to supplement, modify
or add to these claims and to present any additional arguments
required under the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules,
the Procedural Orders and the Arbitral Tribunal’s directives in order
to respond to all claims made by the Claimant with regard to this
matter.!*
146. The Tribunal has described, in paragraph 3, 28-36 above, the circumstances which led to
the withdrawal of Eurus Europe from this arbitration. Its withdrawal did not affect Eurus

Japan’s prayer for relief, which encompasses the claims listed in paragraph 144 above.

147. In its Counter-Memorial, Spain raised several jurisdictional objections, as reflected in its
prayer for relief reproduced in paragraph 145 above. In particular, Spain argued that the
Tribunal lacked jurisdiction ratione personae over Eurus Europe, which as a Dutch
national is not a national of another ECT Contracting Party within the meaning of

Article 26(1) of the ECT. Alternatively, Eurus Europe is not an investor protected by the

33 Resp, Rej., fl 896, 897.

39

ECT, since the Netherlands and Spain are member states of the European Union and the

ECT does not apply to intra-EU investment disputes.'*

148. In its written pleadings, Spain did not present this as an objection to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction over the claims brought by Eurus Japan. There remain, however, other
objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and to the admissibility of certain claims:
these are dealt with in Part V of this Award. In addition, in its closing submissions Spain
raised for the first time objections related to the Tribunal’s competence over claims brought
by Eurus Japan, specifically ‘that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction ratione materiae’

over Eurus Japan’s claim'* in light of the decision of the CJEU in the Achmea case.

149. The Parties’ respective positions on the matters at issue in the arbitration are summarized
in the Parts that follow. The Tribunal has considered the full extent of the Parties’
arguments in both their written and oral submissions. The fact that a given argument is not
referred to expressly in the summary of the Parties’ positions should not be considered as

an indication that the Tribunal has not considered the argument.

150. As a general matter, it is well-known that the issues facing the Tribunal have been or are
being dealt with in more than 40 completed or pending arbitration cases against Spain
under the ECT, as well as in a variety of other cases concerning renewable energy
incentives brought against other states under the ECT or bilateral investment treaties.
The Parties have relied on many of the awards and decisions issued by the tribunals in
those cases, asking this Tribunal to adopt or depart from their conclusions. This presents a
question of principle as to how these diverse (and partly inconsistent) decisions are to be
treated. In the Tribunal’s view, it should have careful regard to relevant awards and
decisions duly presented to it, but it is bound to make up its own mind based on the
arguments of the Parties and its own analysis of the facts and the applicable law. This
conclusion is to some extent qualified by the fact that the Spanish cases have mostly

concerned the same measures and similar, if not identical, issues. Where tribunals have

taken a consistent position, the Tribunal should pay particular attention to that position and

the reasoning supporting it.

JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

The Tribunal turns to the issues of jurisdiction and admissibility raised in the course of the

proceedings.

In this context, it is necessary to make a preliminary point as to the arguments raised (or not
raised or not maintained) by Spain, a number of which arguably relate to issues of European
public order (ordre public). Spain, having argued in its written pleadings that the Tribunal
lacked jurisdiction over the intra-EU claim maintained by Eurus Europe, did not make any
such argument in relation to Eurus Japan. It accepted that Eurus Japan’s investments were
lawfully made, and implicitly that Eurus Japan was and is an investor as defined in Article
1(6) of the ECT. It did not take any jurisdictional point as to its initial failure to notify the
Special Regime under European state aid rules, despite the fact that this failure may have
resulted in the subsidies granted to the SPCs having adverse consequences under European
law. Nor did Spain present any expert evidence on the European law of state aid, despite

the fact that this has been done in certain cases involving the Disputed Measures.

In the Tribunal’s view, EU member states that are parties to ECT proceedings (or indeed
BIT proceedings generally) remain sui juris. Accordingly, they have the normal capacities
that a state party has in an arbitration, including the capacity to formulate its case and to
take steps in the proceeding.'*° The legal consequences of such choices of litigation
strategy are a matter for the Tribunal to appreciate in the course of its award, applying the

standards of international law.

'86 In Antaris, the tribunal refused an application to admit the CJEU’s decision in Achmea on the ground that it was
‘too late, since [...] [Respondent] had waived any objection on the EU jurisdictional point’. CL-0115, Antaris, { 73.

FIRST OBJECTION: THE TVPEE Is A TAXATION MEASURE WHICH IS EXEMPT FROM THE
SCOPE OF THE ECT BY REASON OF ARTICLE 21(1) OF THE ECT

The Claimant argues that the Respondent breached its obligations under Article 10(1) of
the ECT by introducing, by means of Law 15/2012, a 7% tax on the value of electric energy
production (the TVPEE). The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to
determine that claim because the TVPEE is a taxation measure exempt from the scope of

the ECT by reason of the carve-out of Article 21(1) of the ECT.!7

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. The Respondent’s position

The Respondent argues that it has not consented to arbitrate disputes deriving from tax
measures such as the TVPEE. Under Article 26(3) of the ECT, Spain only consented to
arbitrate disputes arising out of alleged breaches of Part III of the ECT. While Article 10(1)
of the ECT is included in Part III, the TVPEE — the introduction of which allegedly
breaches Spain’s obligations under Article 10(1) — is a taxation measure. Taxation
measures are exempt from the scope of protection of Article 10(1) by virtue of Article
21(1) of the ECT, which provides that ‘nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose
obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties.’ Article 21(5)
reapplies Article 13 to taxation measures, subject to a process of preliminary referral to
‘the relevant Competent Tax Authority’, a matter to which the Tribunal will return. But

Article 10(1) is not reapplied.

The Respondent maintains that the TVPEE is a ‘Taxation Measure’ as defined by
Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT. In accordance with this definition, the TVPEE is a domestic
law of Spain, enacted by the Spanish Parliament in accordance with the relevant procedures

under Spanish law,'** and is recognized as a tax under Spanish and international law.'*?

58 Resp, Rej., | 110.
89 Resp, Rej., ff L11-116.

157. Spain also submits, contrary to the Claimant’s argument,'*° that the TVPEE is a bona fide
taxation measure. According to Spain, the TPVEE is a tax applying generally to both
renewable and conventional energy producers, which are granted the same treatment
without according tax benefits to renewable energy procedures not accorded to others.'4!
In November 2014, the Constitutional Court of Spain confirmed the legislator’s right to
enact the TVPEE, dismissing the appeal brought by the Government of Andalusia against

the alleged unconstitutionality of Law 15/2012.'”

158. Spain further argues that this case does not present the extraordinary circumstances (such
as the destruction of a company and the elimination of a political opponent) found in the
cases Hulley v. Russia and Yukos v. Russia,'* on which the Claimant relies to illustrate
non-bona fide taxes.'*+ The taxation measures imposed in those cases pursued a purpose

entirely unrelated to that of obtaining revenue for the state.'4°

159. The purpose of the TVPEE is precisely to raise revenue for Spain to finance public

expenses. The revenues from the TVPEE are accounted for in Spain’s annual General

 

Budget; it is not a disguised tariff cut targeting producers of renewable energy.'*° In fact,
the economic effects of the TVPEE on producers of renewable energy are neutralized.
Spain notes that RE producers are entitled to receive the specific remuneration to recover
the costs of the TVPEE, because under Order IET/1045/2014, the TPVEE is among the

operating costs considered to calculate the specific remuneration that they receive.'*”

Finally, the Respondent relies on the awards of the tribunals in Jsolux Infrastructure
Netherlands, B.V. v. Kingdom of Spain (SCC Case No. V2013/153)'#® and Eiser
Infrastructure Limited and Energia Solar Luxembourg S.a.r.1. v. Kingdom of Spain ((CSID
Case No. ARB/13/36).'*? Those tribunals declared that they lacked jurisdiction to decide
the claim for alleged breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT through the introduction of the
TVPEE by Law 15/2012.!%°

b. The Claimant’s position

The Claimant argues that the carve-out of Article 21(1) of the ECT only applies to taxation
measures that are bona fide, i.e. not actions disguised as a tax but aiming at achieving a
different purpose.'*! The Claimant views the TVPEE established by Law 15/2012 not as
a bona fide tax, but as a disguised requirement that RE producers reimburse Spain for a

portion of their pecuniary incentives.'**

The Claimant argues that the circumstances surrounding the enactment of Law 15/2012
reveal that its purpose to improve Spain’s level of energy efficiency ‘was a sham’.!*?
The Claimant refers, among others, to statements by the then President of the Government
of Spain and the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism, to the effect that, as a result of
the tariff deficit, Spain would have to reform the remuneration payable to RE producers.
The Claimant also refers to statements of members of the Spanish Parliament when Law
15/2012 was debated, that the tax did not comply with the objective of more efficient use

and respect for the environment and energy sustainability.!>*

The Claimant maintains that even the Spanish Supreme Court had doubts about the

constitutionality of the tax and its stated environmental purpose, because renewable energy

producers are already subject to a trade tax on their economic capacity. The Claimant
explains that the Spanish Constitutional Court rejected the Supreme Court’s question about
the constitutionality of the TVPEE, on the ground that the question should have been posed
to the CJEU, but did not rule on the substance of the question.!°> The doubts of the Spanish
Supreme Court bolster the inference that the TVPEE was introduced with an ulterior

purpose.!°°

In addition, the Claimant explains that RE producers are prevented from passing the cost
of the TVPEE on to consumers, because RE producers cannot determine the price of their
product; they have to accept a regulated premium.'°’ This discriminatory effect was
reflected, among others, in the discussions in the Spanish parliament preceding the
adoption of Law 15/2012 and in statements by Spain’s Ministry of Energy and Tourism

saying that Spain could have opted to reduce premiums, but instead chose to adopt a tax.!**

Also, Spain offers no reasons why the extraordinary conditions of the cases Hulley v.
Russia and Yukos v. Russia are not present here. The Claimant maintains its position that
the TVPEE of Law 15/2012 was introduced with the purpose of reducing incentives to RE
producers and was shaped as a tax to avoid liability under the ECT, which is a purpose

entirely unrelated to that of raising revenue for Spain, as in Yukos.'*?

The fact that the TVPEE is of general application arguably misses the point. Most of the
Claimant’s wind plants have been unable to offset the TVPEE, since they have obtained

returns above 7.398% and thus are not eligible to receive specific remuneration under the

New Regime. For this reason, Spain’s explanation that the TVPEE is one of the costs that

RE producers, including Claimant, are allowed to offset is not relevant here.!©

167. Finally, in the Claimant’s view, Jsolux v. Spain and Eiser v. Spain offer no useful guidance.
In Isolux v. Spain, the tribunal considered that Spain’s adoption of Law 15/2012, although
misleading, did not rise to the level of Russia’s conduct in the adoption of taxation
measures in the cases Yukos and RosInvest. The ruling in Isolux v. Spain arguably failed to
appreciate the connection between Spain’s use of a tax to reduce incentives and the fact

that Spain was facing the first claims under the ECT.'*!

168. Eurus Japan is in a different position compared to the claimants in Eiser v. Spain in respect
of Law 15/2012. In Eiser v. Spain, the tribunal reasoned that any damages flowing from
the TVPEE would be reduced, if not eliminated, by Spain’s inclusion of the TVPEE among
the costs compensable to CSP operators subject to the new regime that replaced RD
661/2007.' Here, all but two of the Claimant’s wind farms have received no incentives
over the pool price, with the effect that the Claimant has not been able to recover the cost
of the TVPEE through such incentives. If the TVPEE is found to be in breach of Article

10(1) of the ECT, the Claimant’s damages would be substantial.'®

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

169. In agreement with all other tribunals which have faced this issue, the Tribunal holds that
the TVPEE is a taxation measure excluded from its jurisdiction under Article 10(1) of the

ECT by reason of the carve-out in Article 21(1) of the ECT, which provides:

Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty
shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation
Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any
inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the
Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.!™

46

170. The ECT does not define the term ‘taxation measure’, although Article 21(7)(a) includes
within the scope of this term ‘any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the
Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a local authority therein’ as well
as ‘any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of double taxation
or of any other international agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is

bound.’!65

171. To interpret Article 21, the Tribunal will apply the general rule of treaty interpretation as
found in Article 31(1) of the VCLT, which provides that ‘[a] treaty shall be interpreted in
good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty

in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.’

172. The Tribunal agrees that the term ‘taxation measure’ should be given its ordinary meaning
in the context of the treaty. According to the interpretation of the term ‘taxation measures’

in EnCana v. Ecuador:

The question whether something is a tax measure is primarily a
question of its legal operation, not its economic effect. A taxation
law is one which imposes a liability on classes of persons to pay
money to the State for public purposes. The economic impacts or
effects of tax measures may be unclear and debatable; nonetheless a
measure is a taxation measure if it is part of the regime for the
imposition of a tax. A measure providing relief from taxation is a
taxation measure just as much as a measure imposing the tax in the
first place.'®

173. Furthermore, for a taxation measure to fall within the scope of Article 21(1) of the ECT, it
must have been enacted in good faith. This is not to say that bad faith in the state’s exercise
of its taxing powers is to be presumed. For a taxation measure to have been enacted in bad
faith, the Claimant needs to establish that the disputed measures were taken for ulterior,

improper motives under the guise of taxation and therefore in bad faith. This additional

47

bona fides test was applied by the tribunals in Yukos v. Russia and Hulley v. Russia. In

Yukos v. Russia, the tribunal found that:

[T]he carve-out of Article 21(1) can apply only to bona fide taxation
actions, i.e., actions that are motivated by the purpose of raising
general revenue for the State. By contrast, actions that are taken
only under the guise of taxation, but in reality aim to achieve an
entirely unrelated purpose (such as the destruction of a company or
the elimination of a political opponent) cannot qualify for exemption
from the protection standards of the ECT under the taxation carve-
out in Article 21(1).!

174. The Yukos tribunal, like the tribunal in Hulley, distinguished between bona fide taxation

measures and measures aimed at unrelated purposes such as destroying a company or a

political opponent.!°*

175. Prima facie, the TVPEE is a tax. First, the Claimant concedes that it has all the formal
attributes of a tax.'® Second, it was upheld as such by the Spanish courts. The Respondent

constitutes a compulsory exaction of money by law for public purposes, the Tribunal agrees
with the conclusion in Jsolux v. Spain.'"® The TVPEE was collected by the Spanish state
and was compulsory for all producers of electric energy for the purpose of raising funds
for the state. The objective of Law 15/2012 was to harmonize Spain’s tax system with a
usage that is more efficient and respectful of the environment and sustainability.'"” On its

face, the TVPEE constitutes a compulsory exaction of money by law for public purposes.!78

As to the bona fides requirement, the Tribunal is not confronted with a scenario similar to
the one in Yukos or Hulley. There is no evidence that Spain intended to destroy the Claimant
by means of the TVPEE. As stated by the tribunal in Jsolux v. Spain, the ‘economic
repercussions or effects of the [T]VPEE may be obscure and debatable, but that does not
constitute a sufficient argument to conclude that the [T]VPEE is a tax measure that was

promulgated in bad faith.’!”

In Eiser, the tribunal did not decide whether there is a bad faith exception to Article
21(1):!®° it held that the bad faith allegation ‘could be maintained only if Spain knew or
should have known that the RD 661/2007 tariffs cannot be substantially altered, and so
knowingly violated its obligations under the ECT by adopting Law 15/2012. The evidence

is not sufficient to sustain this contention.’!*!

Without expressing an opinion on the
criterion adopted in Eiser v. Spain for a bad faith allegation to be sustainable, the Tribunal
considers that, in the present case, the Claimant has failed to establish circumstances

indicating that the TVPEE was adopted in bad faith.

In Antaris, the tribunal held that a levy chargeable only to the recipients of subsidies and
collected by way of an offset against subsidy entitlements was not a tax. The decision on
that point is distinguishable inter alia on the basis that the Czech Supreme Administrative

Court had found that the ‘Solar Levy is not a tax for purposes of the prohibition against

double taxation under Czech law’.'*? The avowed purpose of the levy was to reduce the

feed-in tariffs for certain investors and not to raise revenue for the state budget.'**

The Claimant alleges (paragraph 161 above) that the TVPEE applies unequally to its SPCs
because all but two of them are unable to claim back amounts of tax paid because they are
ineligible for subsidies. This allegedly unequal incidence of the TVPEE does not, by itself,
constitute evidence of bad faith. Nor does any such unequal incidence change the character
of the TVPEE as a tax. A tax does not cease to be a tax because it applies unequally or
disproportionately to particular taxpayers or categories of taxpayers, and no such equality
or proportionality of incidence is required by the ECT for a measure to qualify as a taxation
measure. If the TVPEE is a tax measure for the purposes of ECT Article 21(1), Article

10(1) simply does not apply to it.

For these reasons, the TVPEE constitutes a taxation measure for the purposes of
Article 21(1) of the ECT and the claim falls outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction insofar as it

involves an alleged breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT.

SECOND OBJECTION: THE TRIBUNAL LACKS JURISDICTION TO DECIDE ON EURUS’S
GROSS-UP CLAIM IN RELATION TO JAPANESE TAXATION OF THE AWARD UNDER ARTICLE
21(1) OF THE ECT

The Claimant contends that its compensation must comprise a tax gross-up to offset the
taxes to which the amounts potentially awarded to the Claimant may be subject in Japan in
order to receive full compensation.'*+ The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks

jurisdiction to hear the Claimant’s claim as a result of the tax carve-out of Article 21.'*5

the protections afforded by the ECT by reason of the carve-out of Article 21 of the ECT is, in the Tribunal’s view, a
question about the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to adjudicate the gross-up claim, rather than about the admissibility of the

claim.

The Parties argued the issue of the exclusion of the gross-up claim from the scope of the
protections of the ECT as a matter of quantum.'*® However, the question of the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction over the gross-up claim can be addressed already at this stage.

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. The Respondent’s position

The Respondent argues that it has not consented to submit to arbitration the resolution of
disputes deriving from tax measures and that the tax carve-out contained in Article 21(1)

of the ECT applies.'*”

Spain maintains that the carve-out of Article 21 of the ECT excludes from the scope of the
ECT taxation measures implemented in the investor’s host and home state, in so far as both

are ‘Contracting Parties’ to the ECT.!8*

Further, no tax measure in another state can create an obligation for Spain on the basis of
the ECT, considering that in the event of inconsistencies, the tax carve-out of Article 21 of
the ECT prevails over any other provision of the ECT, including Articles 10, 13 and 26 of
the ECT, as provided by the second sentence of Article 21 of the ECT.!*°

Spain argues that its position is consistent with Article 2 of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility, whereby a state’s conduct is an internationally wrongful act giving rise to
international responsibility if it is ‘attributable to the State under international law’ and if
it constitutes a breach of an international obligation of that state.'°? This position is
arguably also consistent with the decision of the tribunal in Rusoro v. Venezuela, according
to which tax liability derived from tax laws of a country other than the investor’s host

country is not a consequential loss arising from the host country’s breach of the treaty and

does not engage the home country’s liability.!°! Therefore, Spain cannot be held liable to

pay for tax measures implemented by Japan for which Spain is not responsible. !°

b. The Claimant’s position

The Claimant maintains that, under the principle of full reparation, it is entitled to be
compensated for the sum of ‘Historical Damages’, ‘Lost Value Damages’, compound
interest on those two amounts of damages”? and, if necessary, a tax gross-up to off-set the

taxes to which the amounts potentially awarded to the Claimant may be subject in Japan.!**

The Claimant argues that, contrary to Spain’s contention,!®°

the claim for a tax gross-up is
‘admissible’ under the ECT. First, the carve-out of Article 21 of the ECT does not apply
to a tax gross-up. Instead, the carve-out aims at maintaining each Contracting State’s
sovereign taxation powers. If the tax gross-up were granted, the Tribunal would not be
imposing obligations on Spain with respect to Japanese measures, nor creating rights in
favour of the Claimant with respect to Spanish taxation measures; the Tribunal would be

awarding additional damages to cover the tax that the Claimant will be required to pay.'!°°

Second, while the Japanese tax is not attributable to Spain, the payment of additional
Japanese taxes on the damages awarded to Claimant is a consequential loss arising from
Spain’s breach of the ECT, which is attributable to Spain.'*” Further, Rusoro v. Venezuela,
referenced by Spain,'* is irrelevant as the claimant there abandoned its request for a tax

gross-up.

Third, the reasoning of the tribunal in ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela was based on the

principle of full compensation, requiring that any tax applied in any country (not just the

investor’s home country) on the proceeds of the award, that should not have been paid in

the absence of a state’s breach, be compensated by the state.!°?

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Eurus seeks higher damages on the basis that it will lose part of the value of the award in
Japanese tax. The Respondent argues that the claim is inadmissible by reason of the tax

carve-out of Article 21(1) of the ECT.

Yet Article 21(1) is not applicable in terms. Article 21(1) excludes from the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal claims relating to a breach of a provision of the ECT that creates rights or

imposes obligations through a taxation measure.

The Claimant’s claim, however, would not ‘create rights or impose obligations with respect
to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties’, as stated in Article 21(1) of the ECT.
This is because the claim is not with regard to a right or an obligation that stems from the

ECT. It constitutes solely a claim for full reparation under international law.

Spain’s only obligation, if it is held to be responsible, is to pay compensation in accordance
with international law. The claim concerns the quantum of that obligation. This leaves the

taxation measures of the Contracting Parties exactly as they were.

The Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction to hear the claim.
THIRD OBJECTION: INADMISSIBILITY OF THE CLAIM FOR EXPROPRIATION UNDER
ARTICLE 13 OF THE ECT

Article 21 of the ECT provides:

(5) (a) Article 13 shall apply to taxes.

(b) Whenever an issue arises under Article 13, to the extent it
pertains to whether a tax constitutes an expropriation or whether a
tax alleged to constitute an expropriation is discriminatory, the
following provisions shall apply:

200 Resp. Rej., {i 850, 858-862.

(i) The Investor or the Contracting Party alleging expropriation shall
refer the issue of whether the tax is an expropriation or whether the
tax is discriminatory to the relevant Competent Tax Authority.
Failing such referral by the Investor or the Contracting Party, bodies
called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2)
shall make a referral to the relevant Competent Tax Authorities;

(ii) The Competent Tax Authorities shall, within a period of six
months of such referral, strive to resolve the issues so referred.
Where non-discrimination issues are concerned, the Competent Tax
Authorities shall apply the non-discrimination provisions of the
relevant tax convention or, if there is no non-discrimination
provision in the relevant tax convention applicable to the tax or no
such tax convention is in force between the Contracting Parties
concerned, they shall apply the non-discrimination principles under
the Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital of the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development;

(iii) Bodies called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c)
or 27(2) may take into account any conclusions arrived at by the
Competent Tax Authorities regarding whether the tax is an
expropriation. Such bodies shall take into account any conclusions
arrived at within the six-month period prescribed in subparagraph
(b)(ii) by the Competent Tax Authorities regarding whether the tax
is discriminatory. Such bodies may also take into account any
conclusions arrived at by the Competent Tax Authorities after the
expiry of the six-month period.

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. The Respondent’s position

197. The Respondent argues that the claim under Article 13 of the ECT for alleged expropriation
of Eurus Japan’s investment by reason of the TVPEE is inadmissible, because the Claimant
failed to refer to the competent national tax authority the issue whether the TVPEE tax

constitutes an expropriation or is discriminatory.?"!

198. Therefore, the Respondent maintains, the carve-out for taxation measures effected by
202

Article 21 of the ECT does not apply to expropriation claims under Article 13.

(Article 13 does not contain a free-standing prohibition of discrimination, although

201.

discrimination is one of the indicia of an expropriatory tax measure.) Article 21(5)(b)(i) of
the ECT sets out a procedure which must be followed whenever an issue arises under

Article 13.

The Respondent argues that the words of the provision ‘shall refer’ indicate that the
procedure of Article 21(5)(b)(i) is mandatory. The Respondent acknowledges that the
claimant in [solux v. Spain already referred the issue to the competent authority, which
determined that the tax was neither expropriatory nor discriminatory,” but argues that
both the referral and the determination in that case are irrelevant, since a referral must be

made on each occasion.

The Respondent maintains that, given that the Claimant continues to be in breach of its
obligation to refer the issue, the Tribunal should declare the Article 13 claim inadmissible
in relation to the TVPEE and refer the issue to the competent tax authorities, pursuant to

Article 21(5)(b)(i) of the ECT.

b. The Claimant’s position

The Claimant contends that the requirement under Article 21(5)(b) of the ECT, to refer the
issue to the competent tax authority, does not apply when referral would be futile.?°> The
claimant in /solux v. Spain referred the issue whether the TVPEE under Law 15/2012 was
expropriatory and/or discriminatory to the Spanish Tax Department, the competent tax
authority in that case.2°° On 29 March 2016, the Spanish Tax Department reported that the
TVPEE was neither expropriatory nor discriminatory, citing in support the judgment of the
Spanish Constitutional Court of 6 November 2014. Also, on 23 December 2014, the
Spanish General Directorate of Taxation issued a written answer to a tax consultation,
saying that the 7% tax of Law 15/2012 is a tax deductible accounting expense, a statement

which the General Directorate of Taxation would not have made had it regarded the 7%

tax as expropriatory or discriminatory.”°’ By the time the Claimant submitted its Request
for Arbitration on 17 February 2016, the position of the competent authority was clear, and

would have made a referral by the Claimant futile.?°

Further, the Claimant argues that Article 21(5) of the ECT does not set a precondition for
the Claimant’s resort to arbitration under Article 26 of the ECT. The sole consequence of
non-compliance with Article 21(5) is that the bodies called upon to settle the dispute under

Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2) (in the present case, this Tribunal) shall make the referral.”

Finally, the Claimant contends that the use of the singular ‘Authority’ in Article 21(5)(b)(i)
was deliberate. The Tribunal already has the benefit of the conclusions of the Spanish
authority, without needing further referral, and may assign them whatever weight it deems

appropriate.?!?

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The first point to make is that Article 21(5), which is carefully drafted, does not say that
failure by a claimant to notify the competent tax authority renders a claim inadmissible.
The sole consequence of such failure is that the tribunal hearing the claim is called on to
notify the competent tax authorities itself. The sole further consequence of such a referral
(provided the competent tax authorities can agree that the tax measure is expropriatory or
discriminatory) is that the tribunal should take any such agreement into account. If the
Article 13 claim were inadmissible by reason of the claimant’s failure to notify the
competent tax authority, there would be no point in the tribunal doing so, because the claim
would already be barred. Hence a claimant’s failure to act is not in itself a ground of

inadmissibility.

Nor will this Tribunal of its own motion notify the competent tax authorities, since it

already knows the position of the competent Spanish authority, which, consistent with the

decision of the Constitutional Court of 4 November 2014 already referred to, is that the
TVPEE is neither expropriatory or discriminatory.7!! This fact, which is relevant not to
admissibility but to the merits, will be taken into account in due course. For the Tribunal
to make a reference itself would be the purest formalism and a waste of time. The Article

13 claim is admissible.

D. PUTATIVE OBJECTION: STATUS OF THE CLAIMANT AS AN INVESTOR FOR THE PURPOSES
OF ARTICLE 26(1) OF THE ECT AND RELATED ISSUES

206. Under Article 26 of the ECT, if an investor is a party to a dispute ‘relating to an Investment
[...], which concern[s] an alleged breach of an obligation of the [host state] under Part III’,
and which cannot be settled amicably within 3 months, the investor may choose to submit

the dispute to arbitration under Part V.
207. ‘Investment’ is defined as:

every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an
investor and includes:

[...] (b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other
forms of equity participation in a company or business enterprise

technical assistance or other fees and payments in kind.7!4
In accordance with these definitions, Eurus Japan is plainly an indirect investor of Japan in
the SPCs, and its investment includes returns which, even if paid through Eurus Europe,

are ‘derived from or associated with an investment’.

As part of its closing submissions, Spain argued that the Claimant had not proven that any
damages suffered at plant level had flowed through to Eurus Japan. In this context, it cited

215

a paragraph in its Counter-Memorial,*!” a passage in the cross-examination of Claimant’s

Respondent argue that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae over Eurus Japan.
It did argue, prior to Eurus Europe’s withdrawal as a Claimant, that there was no
jurisdiction over Eurus Europe, essentially on the ground that the dispute between Spain
and Eurus Europe was an intra-EU dispute to which the ECT did not apply.?!® That
argument, fortified by the CJEU’s decision in the Achmea case, was not put forward by the
Respondent at the oral phase, presumably because it had been rendered moot by Eurus
Europe’s withdrawal from the arbitration. However, the ghost of the argument remained,

as in the following passage:

MS. MORALEDA SACEDA: This dispute concerns EU law from
the beginning point to the end one. You cannot decide this dispute
without EU law; that’s the problem. And that’s the conflict with the
principle of autonomy of EU law, which is a question of public

MS. MORALEDA SACEDA: Declare that the Tribunal does not

have jurisdiction ratione materiae.?’?
In the Tribunal’s view, jurisdiction (if, and to the extent that, it exists) derives from the
ECT, which represents the legal basis for the constitution of the Tribunal. There can be no
doubt, as things stand, as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal ratione personae over Eurus
Japan: indeed, Spain, if not expressly then by clear implication, accepted as much.””° Spain
never presented the flow-through issue as one which affected jurisdiction; rather it went to

quantum, and will be dealt with below in that context.

As to jurisdiction ratione materiae, this too is governed by the ECT, and will be dealt with
below in the context of the applicable law. It is sufficient to hold here that Achmea
concerned jurisdiction under an intra-EU bilateral investment treaty, as made clear by the

CJEU in the operative part of the judgment:

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a
provision in an international agreement concluded between Member
States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and
reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the
Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under
which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the
event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member
State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an
arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has
undertaken to accept.”?!

Achmea did not concern jurisdiction vis-a-vis a third-state national under a multilateral

treaty to which the EU itself was and remains a party.

To summarize, the Achmea decision is inapplicable to the present case, in so far as it

concerns the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the dispute between Eurus Japan as an

indirect investor and the Kingdom of Spain.” It is not necessary therefore for the Tribunal
to decide as between subsequent decisions such as RREEF,2 Greentech2* Cube,?25
SREN,?”6 and Stadtwerke??’which held Achmea inapplicable to intra7EU ECT disputes on
different grounds. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is not called into question by the issue of
flow-through of damages via Eurus Europe to Eurus Japan, which was presented

exclusively as a matter relevant to quantum.

APPLICABLE LAW

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. The Respondent’s Position

In the context of its intra-EU objection,”* Spain argued that EU law has a threefold
dimension in this case, (i) as international law applicable to the resolution of the dispute
under Article 26(6) of the ECT; (ii) as part of Spain’s internal law; and (iii) as a

‘fundamental point’ shaping Eurus’ legitimate expectations.”””

Spain disagrees with the findings of the Cube tribunal, and maintains that ‘EU law is
international law that shall be applied together with the ECT to decide the issues in dispute,
both on jurisdiction and on the merits, pursuant to Article 26(6) of the ECT.’?*° Spain
submits that the Tribunal is bound by primary (treaties) and secondary (EC directives and

decisions) sources of EU law, which are applicable to this case.?*!

Spain relies on the

Framework for Renewable Sources (‘EC decision of 10 November 2017’)** to argue that
the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide whether the Claimant’s wind farms are entitled to
a sine die right to a specific amount of state aid. Such decision, Spain submits, would distort
market competition in the Claimant’s favour, which would amount to a violation of the

‘essential pillar[s]’ of EU law.

The EC decision of 10 November 2017 held that Spain’s current support scheme (i.e. the
Disputed Measures) is state aid compliant with the internal market (Article 107(3)(c) of the
TFEU). Spain argues that the state aid granted until the adoption of the EC decision was
unlawful, because the EC had not been notified of it, which was in breach of Spain’s stand-
still obligation under Article 108(3) TFEU.2*> According to Spain, the EC, following the
CJEU’s settled case law, confirmed that under EU law there is no right to state aid; further,

there cannot be any legitimate expectations to unlawful State aid.?*°

Spain submits that the reasons provided by the EC to consider that the subsidies given
under the Disputed Measures are State aid can be extended to the subsidies provided under
the Special Regime of RD 661/2007.7*’ Spain argues that, in line with the CJEU’s case
law, Eurus cannot have legitimate expectations to unnotified state aid (i.e. subsidies under
RD 661/2007). Thus, the application of EU law excludes the Claimant’s legitimate

expectations claim.?**

Spain contends that the Special Regime was State aid subject to the 2008 Community Guidelines on State Aid for

the Environmental Protection, later replaced by the 2014-2020 Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection
and energy. See Resp. Rej., {{ 63, referring to R-0065, Community Guidelines on State Aid for the Environmental
Protection, (2008/C 82/01) and R-0066, Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy 2014-2020

Spain adds that the EC decision of 10 November 2017 noted that any compensation granted
by a tribunal to an investor on the basis that Spain modified the Special Regime by
introducing the Disputed Measures would constitute state aid. Tribunals are not competent
to authorize state aid, which is an exclusive competence of the EC. Also, any compensation

granted would be notifiable state aid.?*?

b. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that EU law is not applicable to the dispute. Relying on Eureko v.
Slovak Republic?” the Claimant submits that, in accordance with Article 26(6) of the ECT,
an ECT tribunal can interpret and make determinations as to the meaning of EU law if
questions of EU law arise in an ECT dispute. That a tribunal might consider questions of
EU law in deciding the dispute does not mean that an arbitration under the auspices of the
ECT is to be determined according to a source of law other than the ECT.”"! That is, EU
law cannot alter or eliminate the protections granted by the ECT. In this regard, the
Claimant disagrees with the BayWa majority that considered that ‘[o]nly if and to the extent
that the claims made are valid under the ECT do the substantive EU law issues arise.’ In
contrast, the Claimant considers that the Tribunal should take the view of the Cube tribunal,
that EU law is only one among several regional and national legal systems, and ‘[w]ithin
the system of international law, EU law does not have supremacy, and has no hierarchical
priority over the laws of non-Member States, or over rules of international law, including

the ECT.’

Further, the Claimant clarifies that its case rests on Spain’s breaches of its obligations under
the ECT, not on any issue of EU law. Eurus is not asking to receive subsidies in perpetuity
under the Special Regime (what Spain characterizes as a sine die right to state aid). Instead,

the Claimant argues that it was entitled under the ECT to fair and equitable treatment,

including ‘stable’ and ‘favorable’ conditions for its investment. Yet, Spain breached those
substantive standards by eliminating through the Disputed Measures rights that Eurus once
enjoyed. Eurus claims damages for the harm caused by Spain in accordance with the
standard of full reparation under international law. Those damages are measured based on
the amounts that Eurus would have received under the Special Regime, because the most
plausible counterfactual scenario is one in which Spain did not wrongly eliminate rights in

reliance upon which Eurus invested.

The Claimant notes that the alleged effects of Achmea on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction should
have been eliminated from this case with Eurus Europe’s withdrawal.” In any case,
Spain’s argument that payments under a potential award in favor of Eurus would constitute
state aid and bar jurisdiction fails because (i) Eurus is not asking the re-establishment of
the subsidies per se, but the remedy due under international law: lump-sum compensation
for Spain’s breach of its ECT commitments; and (ii) the EC’s decision of 10 November
2017 covers only the Disputed Measures (i.e. the New Regime), it does not declare that the
Special Regime constituted unlawful state aid.?° In this regard, the Claimant notes that the
tribunal in Greentech considered that Spain’s reliance on the EC decision of 10 November
2017 was misplaced, because the tribunal’s jurisdiction derives from the ECT, not from

EU law.747

The Claimant also submits that the satisfaction of an award under the ICSID Convention

cannot constitute state aid.”4* In any event, as decided by the tribunal in Micula v.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Article 26(6) of the ECT deals with the applicable law in arbitrations under Part V.
It provides that:

A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in

dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and

principles of international law.
Also, of potential relevance is Article 16 of the ECT (‘Relation to other Agreements’),

which provides:

Where two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior
international agreement, or enter into a subsequent international
agreement, whose terms in either case concern the subject matter of
Part III or V of this Treaty,

(1) nothing in Part III or V of this Treaty shall be construed to
derogate from any provision of such terms of the other agreement or
from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under that
agreement; and

(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed
to derogate from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from
any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under this Treaty,
where any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or
Investment.

(emphasis added)
By clear inference, Parts III and V of the ECT derogate from any provision of some other
agreement, or from any right to dispute resolution under that agreement, in so far as the

subject matter of the two is common and the ECT provision is more favourable to the

investor or the investment.

In fact, there are no prior or subsequent international agreements between Japan and Spain

the terms of which concern the subject matter of Parts III or V of the ECT, so that the rule

250 Cl, Rej., fi 8-18.

64

of priority expressed in the final (italicized) phrase of Article 16 has no application here.
But Article 16 remains indirectly relevant as concerns the relation between the ECT and
the TFEU, in that by clear implication the ECT prevails over the TFEU to the extent that
the ECT provision ‘is more favourable to the Investor or Investment’. One would not

expect a non-EU member state, or the nationals of such a state, to be treated less well.

230. To the extent that EU law is part of the applicable law under Article 26(6) of the ECT
(i.e. if and insofar as EU law constitutes ‘applicable rules and principles of international

law’), this Tribunal is prima facie authorized to apply it.

231. On this issue, the decisions of earlier tribunals have been markedly inconsistent:

e AES Summit, CL-0050: The parties agreed that EU law is to be taken into account as a
relevant fact,?>! and the tribunal ruled that it would consider the Community

competition law regime as a fact.?>>

© = Electrabel, CL-0018: The tribunal stated that EU law is to be treated as a ‘fact’?* and

is also to be classified as international law.”>4 But in intra-EU disputes, ‘EU law would
prevail over the ECT in case of any material inconsistency’.?>>

e Eureko v. Slovak Republic (Jurisdiction), CL-0096: The tribunal decided that it ‘can
consider and apply EU law, if required, both as a matter of international law and as a

matter of German law’. It further noted, however, that it ‘does not have jurisdiction
to rule on alleged breaches of EU law as such’.?*”

¢ Micula, CL-0023: The parties seemed ‘to agree that EU law forms part of the “factual
matrix” of the case’ and ‘that the question of EU law may be relevant to determining

the pertinent provisions of EU law in particular may be relevant to the determination
of whether, inter alia, Romania’s actions were reasonable in light of all the
circumstances, or whether Claimants’ expectations were legitimate’? However, it
decided that EU law, and state aid law in particular, was irrelevant to the tribunal and

solely a matter for the enforcing court.?

¢  Charanne, RL-0049: The tribunal did not decide on whether the dispute concerned the

interpretation or application of the European treaties in the sense of Article 344 TFEU,
since it took the view that Article 344 does not apply to investor-state arbitrations.?°!

that public international law prevails in case of conflict between the ECT and EU law.

substantially reduced damages to the claimants solely in relation to the allegedly
‘retrospective’ aspects of the 2013-14 regime. That aspect of the decision is discussed

in more detail below.?°

© = Wirtgen, CL-0097: The tribunal concluded that international law encompasses EU

law, but it did not find any relevant conflict, thus the issue of primacy did not arise.?°>

extraneous to the determination that the tribunal must make in respect of the issues in
dispute. The tribunal considered that the issue of claimants’ legitimate expectations
could be resolved without an assessment of the national law that created and
implemented the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the investment.”*>

232. Inthe Tribunal’s view, EU law is part of international law, being established by a series of

treaties as interpreted by courts (notably the CJEU) to whose jurisdiction EU member states
have consented.”* It is correct that Japan is a third party to the EU treaties and is not bound
by them as such. But the EU treaties have established legal regimes for regulating matters
such as state aid, which are furthermore directly applicable as part of the law of the member
states. To the extent that Japanese or other third-state corporations establish activities in

the EU that are regulated by those regimes, they may be affected by them.

233. In oral argument, the Respondent, while accepting that in principle EU law was applicable
to the Claimant’s investment, denied that the Tribunal could apply it, referring to the

CJEU’s strictures as to the autonomy of that law.”*’ In particular, the CJEU said that:

[T]he [EU] judicial system [...] has as its keystone the preliminary
ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, which [...] has
the object of securing uniform interpretation of EU law, thereby
serving to ensure its consistency, its full effect and its autonomy as

well as, ultimately, the particular nature of the law established by
the Treaties.75

234. The Respondent interpreted this passage as denying ECT tribunals (to which the
preliminary ruling procedure is inapplicable) any capacity to have regard to EU law. The
Tribunal does not read the CJEU’s judgment in that sense. The core of the CJEU’s

reasoning was as follows:

57. It is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an
international agreement providing for the establishment of a court
responsible for the interpretation of its provisions and whose
decisions are binding on the institutions, including the Court of
Justice, is not in principle incompatible with EU law. The
competence of the EU in the field of international relations and its
capacity to conclude international agreements necessarily entail the
power to submit to the decisions of a court which is created or
designated by such agreements as regards the interpretation and
application of their provisions, provided that the autonomy of the
EU and its legal order is respected [...].

58. In the present case, however, apart from the fact that the disputes
falling within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal referred to in
Article 8 of the BIT may relate to the interpretation both of that
agreement and of EU law, the possibility of submitting those
disputes to a body which is not part of the judicial system of the EU
is provided for by an agreement which was concluded not by the EU
but by Member States. Article 8 of the BIT is such as to call into
question not only the principle of mutual trust between the Member
States but also the preservation of the particular nature of the law
established by the Treaties, ensured by the preliminary ruling
procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, and is not therefore
compatible with the principle of sincere cooperation referred to in
paragraph 34 above.

59. In those circumstances, Article 8 of the BIT has an adverse effect
on the autonomy of EU law.”

235. In the present case, by contrast, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is not established by ‘an
agreement which was concluded not by the EU but by Member States’. It is established by

a multilateral treaty to which the EU itself is a party. Moreover, the ECT contains no

disconnection clause,” nor does it contain any provision giving precedence to EU over
international law, in particular so far as third states are concerned.””! In the absence of any
such provisions, the Tribunal is called on to apply the normal rule of priority of

international law by virtue of Article 26(6) of the ECT.?”?

References to the autonomy of EU law do not entail that an ECT tribunal may not take EU
law into account in appropriate circumstances. Autonomy is not the same as invisibility,
and ECT tribunals can take note of, and apply, clear and established rules of EU law that
are relevant to the facts before them. This does not convert such tribunals into unmonitored
organs of the EU, nor does it mean that they can exercise powers expressly conferred on
EU organs, such as the various competences of the European Commission in relation to
state aid. It is one thing to exercise conferred powers, and another to note the settled legal
consequences of facts established in the course of the proceedings, for example, the fact
that unnotified state aid gives rise to adverse consequences under Article 108(3) of the
TFEU. To that extent, at least, EU law is part of the applicable law under Article 26(6) of
the ECT.

MERITS
The Claimant alleges three causes of action arising under the ECT:

(A) indirect expropriation (Article 13);
(B) breach of fair and equitable treatment (Article 10(1), first and second sentences);

(C) breach of the obligation of most constant protection, which refers also to
impairment with unreasonable or discriminatory measures (Article 10(1), third

sentence).

2 Cf CL-0083, Blusun, | 280; and many other decisions of investment tribunals to similar effect.
°! The definition of REIO in ECT Art. 1(3) does not have this effect. It is concerned to identify and characterise

bodies such as the EU as parties to the ECT and to identify their role and obligations alongsid

ites parties. Art. 1(3)

 

does not incorporate by reference any conflicts rule of EU law giving it priority over international law in certain cases.

Before turning to the merits of these claims, insofar as they fall within the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction, it is relevant to observe that a large number of parallel claims have been filed
against the Respondent arising out of the Spanish measures, producing somewhat

discrepant results.

As a general matter, investment tribunals (like other international tribunals) are not bound
by a strict doctrine of precedent but are charged to make their own appreciations based on
the evidence and arguments presented to them. In practice, tribunals regularly cite
previous, publicly available awards and pay careful attention to them. In the Tribunal’s
view, concordant decisions on the interpretation and application of the ECT merit serious
consideration, especially if they rise to the level of a jurisprudence constante. Where they
diverge, a later tribunal has no choice but to form its own view of the relevant law and its

application to the facts. This the Tribunal has done.

In assessing the Claimant’s substantive claims, it is appropriate first to consider these under

the ECT before turning to consider the parties’ arguments on EU law.

THE EXPROPRIATION CLAIM: ARTICLE 13(1) OF THE ECT
(LD) The Claimant’s position

The Claimant maintains that the ECT protects investors from direct and indirect
expropriation, unless carried out in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article
13(1) of the ECT. The Claimant contends that unlawful expropriation relates to tangible
property as well as to rights economically significant to the investor, as supported by the
1,293

jurisprudence of international tribunals, as in SPP v. Egyp and as described in the

United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s study on Taking of Property.?**
In particular, relying on Goetz v. Burundi and Middle East Cement v. Egypt, the Claimant

contends that legal rights arising out of unilateral acts by host states, such as laws or

decrees, are protected against unlawful expropriation.””° Further, a state’s intention is
irrelevant when assessing whether the measures taken resulted in an indirect

expropriation.?°°

The Claimant argues that Spain, by adopting the Disputed Measures, in particular, RD-Law
2/2013, expropriated the Claimant’s rights to receive premiums, without providing any
compensation for the Claimant’s losses. The Claimant’s rights to receive premiums derived
from each of the Claimant’s SPCs having received and maintained under Spanish law the
status of Special Producer. Each SPC was entitled to receive, at a minimum, premiums

above the pool price for the generation of electricity.?””

The Claimant’s entitlement was embodied in official certificates, which have been almost
completely devalued through Spain’s removal of the feed-in-tariffs, producing the same

effect as if they had been revoked.”

After Spain adopted the Disputed Measures, 11 out
of 13 SPCs ceased to receive incentives, although their Special Producer Certificates
entitled all of them to do so. The Claimant compares this situation to that of Middle East
Cement v. Egypt, where the tribunal held that a new law prohibiting the importation of
cement, rendering the license to import cement moot, was tantamount to an

expropriation?”

The Claimant maintains that Spain failed to pay any compensation for eliminating the
payment of the feed-in tariffs through RD-Law 2/2013. Relying on the Brattle Regulatory
Report, the Claimant argues that, instead, Spain actively clawed back remuneration that

existing facilities had received under the Special Regime.*”

The Special Regime had no quantitative limit on the cumulative amount of financial
incentives that a RE producer could receive. But then the Disputed Measures set a 7.398%
investment return for renewable energy investments, applied not only prospectively but
also retrospectively. This means that, if an investor had earned returns exceeding 7.398%
in previous years, the Disputed Measures balanced that with reduced returns (to the point,
where applicable, of zero subsidies) in the future. That is, existing producers, like the
Claimant, must reimburse Spain by means of a set-off for remuneration already received
under the Special Regime, and facilities which overall earned returns exceeding 7.398%
were ineligible for future incentives.*°! This constituted an indirect expropriation of

Claimant’s rights.

Spain thereby breached Article 13 of the ECT by failing to pay ‘prompt, adequate and
effective’ compensation, unlawfully expropriating the Claimant’s legal rights as a Special

Producer.

(2) The Respondent’s position

The Respondent argues that no expropriation of rights has occurred, since the rights that
the Claimant argues were expropriated do not exist under Spanish law and, therefore, are

not part of Claimant’s assets. Further, the Disputed Measures were not retroactive.*

The Respondent explains that the certificates to which the Claimant refers were granted
upon registration in the RAIPRE. Such certificates resulted from a mandatory
administrative step both for conventional and renewables producers and did not reflect any

commitment by Spain to guarantee a certain tariff indefinitely into the future.*”

Registration was used by Spain to monitor the evolution of the electrical energy produced
and used, and the energy transferred into the grid, to verify that the objectives in the Plan
to Encourage Renewable Energies in Spain 2000-2010 were met. This view was supported

by the tribunal in Charanne v. Spain*™ and follows from RD 2366/1994, which created the

RAIPRE and defined its purpose as gathering statistics and offering information about the

contribution of the plants to the electrical system.*°°

250. The Respondent argues that, when the Disputed Measures were approved, the Claimant
did not hold an acquired right to receive a subsidy indefinitely in time beyond a reasonable
return, nor did it hold an acquired right that the formulas used to set the premiums would
remain unchanged. Such rights have never existed and cannot be acquired rights
incorporated within Claimant’s assets protected against expropriation under Article 13 of
the ECT.* This position also finds support in the 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2009 Judgments

of the Supreme Court, a report of the CNE, and a ruling of the EC.*°”

251. The Respondent also argues that the Disputed Measures are not expropriatory because they

were not retroactive, either under international law or under Spanish law. Relying on

308

Nations Energy v. Panama,*”* the Respondent maintains that regulations which are applied

in the future, but do not affect rights already acquired, are not retroactive from an
international law perspective.*”” Here, the payment of the new remuneration was deployed
to the future, taking into account as a relevant fact payments made before the entry into

force of RD-Law 2/2013.3!°

Further, the tribunal in /solux v. Spain considered that RD-Law 9/2013 did not have a
retroactive effect; instead it applies to the future as it did not revoke rights acquired in the
operation of the plants.*!! Relying on Charanne v. Spain, the Respondent argues that the
concept of retroactivity defended by the Claimant implies freezing the regulatory
framework with respect to the remuneration throughout the entire lifetime of a facility,
which is contrary to the object and purpose of the ECT, which allows adopting

macroeconomic control measures, even if investors’ profits are reduced thereby.?!”

The Disputed Measures are not retroactive under Spanish law, as confirmed by the Spanish
Constitutional Court*!* and the Spanish Supreme Court.*!+ These courts ruled that the
modification of the reasonable rate of return introduced by the Disputed Measures only
affected the overall calculation of subsidies that the owners of facilities were entitled to in

future, without affecting or clawing back amounts received in the past.?!°

(1) Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of
any other Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated
or subjected to a measure or measures having effect equivalent to
nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as
‘Expropriation’) except where such Expropriation is:

(c) carried out under due process of law; and

(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective

The claim under Article 13 presents a number of issues.

First, it is necessary to distinguish between the claim for expropriation under Article 13 of
the ECT and claims made under Article 10, 1st—3rd sentences, whether based on instability,
frustration of reasonable or legitimate expectations or unreasonable or discriminatory
measures. Article 13 of the ECT, like other expropriation guarantees, is concerned with the
protection of property interests, including certain legal rights to money or benefits, from
seizure or taking, or with conduct equivalent thereto. It is not intended to protect the wider
range of interests associated with the idea of reasonable or legitimate expectations. Such

expectations can be frustrated or denied, but they cannot be expropriated.

Secondly, when it comes to conduct tantamount to expropriation (or as formulated in
Article 13, conduct having ‘equivalent effect’), it is necessary to bear in mind that
expropriation, direct or indirect, requires substantial deprivation of the asset in question or

its value. For example, the tribunal in AES v. Hungary observed:

For an expropriation to occur, it is necessary for the investor to be
deprived, in whole or significant part, of the property in or effective
control of its investment: or for its investment to be deprived, in
whole or significant part, of its value.*!”

There are many other decisions to similar effect.?!*

For the purposes of Article 13 of the ECT, it is necessary to ask, first, what rights are

identified by the Claimant as having been expropriated. As to this, the Claimant clarified

316 CL-0001, ECT, Art. 13(1).

317 CL-0050, AES v. Hungary, | 14.3.1

318 See, e.g., RL-0049, Charanne, { 464 (‘[FJor a loss of value to be equivalent to an expropriation, it has to be so
large that it equals a deprivation of property’); CL-0112, Novenergia I, { 727 (‘It is uncontroversial in international
arbitration that a State measure resulting in a “substantial deprivation” of an investment — that is, when the measure
substantially interferes with the control or the economic value of the investment — constitutes an expropriation.’);
RL-0024, Isolux, § 839 (‘That is to say, the impact to the rights or goods of the investor of the measures, must be of
such magnitude that its investment loses all or a significant part of its value, which amounts to a deprivation of its
property.’).

77

in oral argument that ‘the claim is for an expropriation of the public law right to the
FITs’.*!° That public law right was said to arise, in the first place, from the Special Producer
Certificates issued to each of the project companies pursuant to their registration in the

RAIPRE.*”

260. The RAIPRE was created by Article 6 of RD 2366/1994, which provided that:

1. For the purpose of adequately monitoring energy planning, in
terms of both installed power and evolution of produced energy and
primary energy used, a General Registry of Special Regime
Production Facilities is hereby created within the General Energy
Agency of the Ministry of Industry and Energy [...].*?!

261. Article 7 of RD 2366/1994 then spelled out producers’ rights and obligations under the

Special Regime, but it did not specify the duration of those rights.
262. This was replaced by relevant provisions of the Spanish Electrical Power Law 54/1997:

Article 21(4). An Administrative Register of Electricity Generation
Installations is hereby created in the Ministry of Industry and Energy
in which all those electricity generation installations that have been
authorised must be entered together with their conditions and
especially the capacity of the installation.

Article 31. Electricity installations falling under the special regime
must be entered in the Administrative Register of Electricity
Generation Installations referred to in point 4 of article 21 of this
Act. In each case, the entry shall specify the remunerative
arrangements that apply.*?*

263. Subsequent royal decrees were to similar effect, referring back to the Administrative

Register created by the 1997 Law.°3

In the Tribunal’s view, these are perfectly standard administrative provisions, and do not

by

themselves imply immutability. The RAIPRE registration was_ essentially

administrative in effect; it qualified applicants to receive FITs but did not entail a binding

promise that these would be maintained unchanged.

In that respect, the tribunal in Charanne held that:

[T]he Respondent has convincingly proved that, under Spanish law,
registration with the RAIPRE was a mere administrative
requirement in order to be able to sell energy, and by no means
implied that registered facilities had a vested right to a certain
remuneration.>74

Nor has the Claimant established that, as a matter of Spanish law, the operating companies

had a vested right to a particular remuneration. The Spanish courts have consistently denied

there was any such right.

For example, in relation to an appeal brought against RD

436/2004, the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court stated in its Judgment of 15 December
2005:

There is no legal obstacle that exists to prevent the Government in
the exercise of the regulatory powers and of the broad entitlements
it has in a strongly regulated issue such as electricity, from
modifying a specific system of remuneration as long as [the
Government stays] within the framework set out by the ELS [1999
Electricity Law]*?>

The Third Chamber also stated in its Judgment of 25 October 2006
amendments made to RD 436/2004:

Until it is replaced by another, [Article 30 of the Electricity Law]
allows the respective companies to expect that the fixing of the
premiums can be included as a factor relevant to their obtaining
“reasonable rates of return with reference the cost of money in the
capital market” or, to put it again in the words of the preamble to
Royal Decree 436/2004, “reasonable compensation for their
investments.” However the payment regime under examination does
not guarantee to special regime electricity producers that a certain
level of profits or revenues will be unchanged relative to those

324 RL-0049, Charanne, { 510.
35 R-0137, 2005 Judgment, eighth legal ground.

79

in relation to

obtained in previous years, or that the formulas for fixing the
premiums will stay unchanged.*?°

268. Again, on 20 March 2007, the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court stated:

What article 30 of the [1997 Act] allows companies is to aspire that
the premiums would include [...] reasonable return rates in relation
to the cost of money in the capital market; that is, a reasonable return
on their investments. Owners of facilities under a Special Regime
are not guaranteed the intangibility of a given benefit or income
regime in relation to those obtained in previous years, nor are they
guaranteed the indefinite permanence of the formulas used to fix
premiums. Changes should be made within the legal limits.*?7

269. Furthermore, the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court has stated on many occasions that
the ‘public regulatory framework [...] could not subsequently be immune to any relevant

modifications to basic economic data in the light of which it is logical for the public

authorities to keep in step with the new circumstances.’**8

270. In its decision of 3 December 2009 rejecting a challenge to RD 661/2007, the Third

Chamber of the Supreme Court stated:

Nor can recognition of the right of producers under the special
regime to the immutability of this regime be understood, since the
Government, according to the intent of the Legislator, holds a
margin of assessment to determine the energy outputs offered, in
line with clear targets inherent in the execution of the economic,
energy and environmental policies, and taking into consideration in
the exercising of its regulatory power the obvious and essential
general interests involved in the correct operation of the electricity
production and distribution system and, in particular, the rights of
the users.*?°

It added that ‘the principle of legal certainty [...] does not include any right to the freezing

of the existing legal system’ .**°

In short, expropriation of intangible rights requires, inter alia, that the rights in question

exist under the relevant legal system, which is not the case here.

It may be recalled that no ECT tribunal has yet upheld an Article 13 claim in relation to the
Disputed Measures. Such claims have either been avoided on the ground that the dispute

was covered by Article 10 or rejected outright.**!

Accordingly, the Claimant’s expropriation claim fails because the right claimed to have
been expropriated was not an acquired right susceptible of expropriation. Had the
expropriation claim been made in respect of the Claimant’s 100% indirect interest in the
project companies, that claim would have also failed, because the plants are still intact and
operating under the Claimant’s ultimate control and continued oversight, although their
value is impaired. Two of the wind farms are still receiving subsidies. In sum, the Claimant
has alleged no conduct on the part of Spain that is tantamount to expropriation, and

consequently the Article 13 claim fails.

In the end, the Claimant’s main argument has been that the subsidy regime of RD 661/2007
was to be maintained in its essentials by virtue of Article 10(1) of the ECT, not that it was
a vested right. Its chief claim is to stability, not immutability. It is to that claim that the

Tribunal turns.

SPAIN’S ALLEGED BREACH OF ARTICLE 10(1) OF THE ECT, FIRST & SECOND SENTENCES
(1) The Claimant’s Position
a. The FET standard

The Claimant maintains that the FET standard under the ECT is especially protective of
investors’ legitimate expectations with respect to regulatory environments. Article 10(1)

of the ECT requires states to provide ‘fair and equitable’ treatment and sets a higher

331 As in RL-0049, Charanne, {| 460-467; CL-0112, Novenergia II, {| 759-763, RL-0024, Isolux, [9] 837-854.

81

standard of protection than the typical FET standard of a bilateral investment treaty, by
requiring states to create ‘stable’ and ‘favourable’ conditions,*** particularly, for
environmentally-friendly energy investments, as follows from the ECT’s object and

purpose.

277. Investment tribunals have confirmed that the FET standard requires states to offer
‘consistent and transparent behaviour’,*** to grant and maintain a stable and predictable
regulatory framework to fulfil the justified expectations of a foreign investor at the time of
the investment.** This special feature of the ECT does not prevent Spain from changing
its regulatory framework, but commits Spain to ‘provide fundamental stability in the
essential characteristics of the legal regime relied upon by investors in making long-term

investments,’ as held by the tribunal in Eiser v. Spain.**°

278. The Claimant argues that legitimate expectations are to be determined objectively, having
regard to the regulatory framework in place at the time of the investment. This is especially
so, when such framework is designed to address the needs of a special class of long-term
investors, like investors in energy generation facilities.°° The adoption of retroactive
legislation is one of the strongest forms of regulatory instability and disfavouring treatment,
and the European Commission has discouraged states from retroactive regulatory

intervention in the electricity sector.**”

279. The Claimant first invested in Spain in 1997 (Paxareiras I and IIa),*** with a final expansion

of its investment in 2008 (Grallas). During that period, all of Claimant’s SPCs were entitled

338 The Claimant submits that its contributions to Spain began long before any conceivable concern about Spain’s
economic situation. The Claimant affirms that it began considering investing in wind power in Spain in 1992 when
Tomen and SeaWest Espaifia explored sites in Galicia and Asturias; in 1995 Eurus presented its strategic plan to the
Xunta; and in 1997 Eurus began its investment. See Claimant’s comments on BayWa, 9 January 2020, {| 4, referring

to benefit from the Special Regime, last revised through RD 661/2007.** Relying, among

340

others, on Saluka v. Czech Republic,’ the Claimant argues that, for the purposes of

determining when Claimant’s legitimate expectations were formed, the Tribunal should
see the constituent parts of Claimant’s investment in Spain as an indivisible whole;**! with
Claimant’s decision to invest based on an assessment of the regulatory framework existing
at the time of the investment and the changes made during the investment process,

including RD 661/20073%2

The Claimant argues that this view was supported by the tribunal in Blusun v. Italy, which
held that the substantive protections of Article 10(1) of the ECT are not limited to the initial
making of the investment, but include subsequent extensions of the investment and changes

of form.

b. Spain breached Article 10(1) of the ECT by violating Claimant’s legitimate
expectations

The Claimant did not expect Spain to petrify its regulatory framework, but it expected that
Spain would not significantly weaken or take away the Special Regime in respect of any
existing SPC for the duration of its operational lifetime. The Claimant expected that its
investments would benefit from a regime at least as favourable as that set out in RD
661/2007.** Brattle, the Claimant’s regulatory expert, explains in its Regulatory Report
that stable governmental Special Regimes are critical to attract long-term investment in
wind power, as such investments have high up-front costs and must operate a long time to

recoup those costs.*4>

282. The Claimant argues that its expectations of stability, ie. that the subsidies to the

Claimant’s SPCs would not be retroactively revoked, were legitimate on the basis that the

Special Regime legislation included provisions that signalled Spain’s view of the FITs as

a way to encourage long-term energy investments to reach its long-term environmental

goals.

346

283. Further, other contextual sources confirm that the Claimant’s expectations arising out of

Spain’s legislation were legitimate:

qd)

(2)

The Preamble of RD 2366/1994 states that renewable energies reduce the
consumption of conventional primary energy with a positive impact on
environmental protection.**” Article 7 of RD 2366/1994 stated that Special
Producers, such as all of the Claimant’s projects, had the right to ‘transfer their
excess energy to the electricity distribution company, provided it [was] possible for
such energy to be absorbed by the grid and to receive in exchange the price resulting
from the provisions of this Royal Decree.’ Spain did not include language to limit

the duration of such right.*#*

Also, in setting out the formula to calculate the
additional compensation above the market price (‘coefficient’) that Special
Procedures would receive, Article 18 of RD 2366/1994 stated that after a period of
five years, the value of the coefficient shall ‘remain constant,’ without including
any language to contradict the message that it would continue so long as the

facilities of Special Producers were able to produce power.*””

The preamble of Law 54/1997 placed the promotion of renewable energies above
all considerations in Spain’s energy policy. Further, the Eighth transitory provision
of Law 54/1997 provided that in the case that premiums were revised in the future,

(3) The preamble of RD 2818/1998 expressly stated that there was ‘no time limit’ for
the incentives granted to Special Producers, and explained the economic logic
behind that decision, as the inability of renewable energy facilities to compete in a
free market due to their characteristics, technologies and higher costs. Article 32
of RD 2818/1998 established that Special Producers could continue to be subject
to the previous remuneration schemes, even in case of revision of the premiums set

in RD 2818/1998, by reference to the eighth transitory provision of Law 54/1997.*>!

(4) The preamble of RD 436/2004 referred to the ‘security and stability’ of the
calculation method of the remuneration under the special regime to ‘foster
investment in this kind of plants.’*°* Article 1(b) of RD 436/2004 stated that the
purpose of the decree was to establish a lasting economic regime for plants eligible
to be under the special regime, based on an objective, transparent methodology to
calculate the remuneration. Article 34 set out a timeline for wind power facilities
to receive a certain tariff from the 15" year onwards (emphasis added), i.e. on an
indefinite basis.*> Article 40 provided explicitly that future revisions to incentive

rates would not apply to existing facilities.***

(5) Article 36 of RD 661/2007 set out that wind power facilities would be entitled to
receive certain financial incentives the first 15 years and then, certain incentives

thereafter (emphasis added), i.e. indefinitely in time.*>

Special Regime was confirmed by reports issued by the Claimant’s independent financial
advisers in 1997 and 2001. They reported that major adverse changes in the policy toward
wind power were highly unlikely in the foreseeable future and that the risk that electricity
prices decrease in the future was mitigated by the regulatory framework, which promoted

the renewable energy sector without a time limit.*°® The Claimant also rejects Spain’s

suggestion that Eurus’ due diligence was insufficient with regard to the case-law of the
Spanish Supreme Court from October 2006. Eurus notes that its investment began in 1997

and only one of its facilities, Grallas, was approved after October 2006.7°”

The Claimant also argues that its expectations based on the Spanish legislation on Special
Regime were legitimate, as they were bolstered by personal assurances by the President of
Galicia at a meeting in the Spanish Embassy in Tokyo, in which he invoked the Special
Regime and encouraged the Claimant to invest.*** The Claimant’s legitimate expectations
were also underscored by (i) Galicia’s Xunta and the Government of Asturias approving in
1996 EuroVento’s long-term plan in wind farms, and granting Special Producer status to
the Claimant’s SPCs to receive remuneration consistent with the Special Regime; and
(ii) the Power Purchase Agreements (‘PPA’) that Spanish state-owned utilities entered into
with the SPCs, allowing the SPCs to sell all of their electricity to the utilities in line with

the Special Regime.**”

c. Spain breached Article 10(1) of the ECT by failing to maintain stable and
favourable conditions for the Claimant’s investment

According to the Claimant, Spain’s retroactive changes to the Special Regime also
constitute unstable and unfavourable conditions for its investment, in breach of
Article 10(1) of the ECT. The Claimant does not dispute that Spain could alter the Special
Regime as applied to new projects and new investors. But Spain violated the FET standard
by retroactively and fundamentally changing the Special Regime into a new regulatory
framework, reducing the value of the Claimant’s investment to about one third of what it

used to be.7°°

The Claimant notes that the tribunal in Total v. Argentina recognized a state’s power to fix

the tariffs of a public utility, if operation costs can be recovered, investments amortized

and a reasonable return over time can be made.**! Yet, the Disputed Measures fail to meet
these conditions. Spain says that the Disputed Measures maintained stability, as they were
consistent with the principle governing the investments made under Law 54/1997,
‘to ensure that all investors could recover, by taking a “standard facility” as a reference,
(1) the cost of their investment, (2) the operating costs and (3) obtain reasonable rate of
return.’** The Claimant disputes that tying subsidies to the costs of hypothetical standard
facilities in 2014, at the time of the Disputed Measures, which did not form part of Spain’s
regulatory framework when the Claimant invested and subsequently expanded its
investment, fails to ensure that existing investors can recover the costs of wind facilities
built from 1997 to 2008. Thereby, Spain failed to provide stable conditions in breach of
Article 10(1) of the ECT.3%

Also, the Disputed Measures removed the option to receive premiums, capped the
investment returns at a rate of 7.398% (before tax) and effectively required the Claimant
to reimburse Spain for incentives that it previously received under the Special Regime.*™
The Disputed Measures result in many of the Claimant’s plants having insufficient
remuneration to cover their operating costs, financing commitments, and to generate the
expected returns.*® Before the Disputed Measures, the Special Regime ensured that
investors like the Claimant could earn minimum returns, without any cap on such

returns.*°°

The Disputed Measures’ cap on investment returns has left 11 out of the
Claimant’s 13 SPCs receiving no incentives, showing that, contrary to Spain’s allegation,
it is not correct that Spain ‘maintained the subsidies’.**’ Thereby, Spain failed to create

stable and favourable conditions for the Claimant’s investment.

d. The Claimant’s position on the internal rate of return (IRR)

The Claimant’s expert Brattle rebutted the IRR analysis as put forward by the Respondent’s
expert BDO. It made two main points. First, it disagreed with the use of individual plant
cash flows instead of a target standard installation. Second, BDO’s methodology was

inaccurate as it overstated the IRR and understated the required return.*°*

Since Eurus’s plants have had a higher production than the standard installations in the
past, it is reasonable for Eurus to receive higher returns. Yet, BDO’s IRR analysis takes
advantage of this situation and uses the Claimant’s high profitability to deny any negative
impact to the Disputed Measures. By using the cash flows of a standard facility this

scenario would be avoided.*

Furthermore, Brattle argued that BDO omitted to include in the analysis important portions
of the initial investment costs, which fell into two categories: ‘Financing and other’ costs,
and ‘Development/Advisory’ costs. Brattle did include these costs in their analysis and as

a result, the IRR as calculated by BDO dropped from 15.1% to 12.5%.>”

Finally, Brattle maintained that the reasonable return expected by the Claimant is higher
than what BDO considered reasonable. BDO underestimated the return for three reasons.
First, the Claimant’s lack of liquidity raised the risk and would have therefore led to higher
required returns. Second, BDO imputed to the plants the tax benefits of debt financing,
which is inconsistent with the exclusion of ‘Financing and other’ costs from the IRR
calculation. Third, BDO did not include the construction risk, which would raise the cost
of capital by up to 0.5%. Furthermore, BDO estimated the pre-tax WACCs per year by
grossing up its estimate using an effective tax rate of 22%. While the need to apply an
effective tax rate was not disputed, the tax rate as applied by BDO was incorrect. The rate

has not been constant over the years and should be calculated for each year individually.*”!

As a result, the reasonable return before taxes in 2007 according to Brattle was 9.8% with
an after-tax equivalent of 7.3%. This is supported by the 7.398% (pre-tax) that Spain

considered reasonable at the time.>””

(2) The Respondent’s Position
a. The Claimant’s expectations were not legitimate

Spain argues that the Claimant expected that any changes to the Special Regime would
apply only prospectively, petrifying the Special Regime with respect to the Claimant’s
existing facilities, and that in effect it had an acquired right to future tariffs to be received
for the entire useful life of a facility”? Yet, such expectation was not reasonable
considering either the regulatory framework applicable at the time of investment and its

evolution thereafter, or other sources referenced by the Claimant.37*

Spain agrees with the Claimant in that the legitimacy of an investor’s expectations must be
analysed objectively. The Tribunal should assess what the investor knew or should
reasonably have known about the conduct of the host state, as upheld by the tribunal in
Electrabel v. Hungary.*” Here, Spain’s conduct is expressed in the regulatory framework
existing at the time of the investment, which, as decided by the tribunal in Charanne v.

Spain, an investor should diligently analyse to support the legitimacy of its expectations.*”°

Spain maintains that the Claimant fails to show that it performed a diligent analysis of the
existing legal framework,*”’ which a foreign investor in a highly regulated sector, like the
energy sector, should perform.*”* The Claimant failed to produce the due diligence reports
that the Spanish law firm Uria Menéndez made before the Claimant invested in Spain in

19963”

297. Besides, a serious and reasonable assessment of the Spanish regulatory framework and of
its possible changes was required in light of the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of the
Kingdom of Spain. In December 2005 and October 2006, the Supreme Court ruled that the
premiums and incentives to produce electrical energy under the Special Regime might

increase as much as they might decrease from one year to the next.**°

298. Further, a diligent investor should have verified the limits of the regulator’s power to
change the applicable framework. Such limits, Spain says, were found in Law 54/1997,
which sets the principle of ‘reasonable return’ and ‘economic sustainability of the SES’.**!
But, as follows from the witness statement of Mr. Suwabe, the Claimant expected to
receive remuneration in the terms set in RD 661/2007 throughout the lifetime of its SPCs.
In other words, the Claimant expected that the regulatory framework set out in RD
661/2007 would be set in stone with respect to Claimant’s investment, unless a more

favourable one would become available.***

299. Even if the Tribunal found that the Claimant was diligent in its investment decisions, the
Disputed Measures did not violate Claimant’s legitimate expectations. Relying inter alia
on Charanne v. Spain, Electrabel v. Hungary, and Blusun v. Italy,**> Spain contends that
in the absence of specific commitments by a state, an investor cannot legitimately expect
that a certain regulatory framework will remain unchanged.*** As Spain made no specific
commitments to the Claimant that it would not change the Special Regime, the Claimant
could not legitimately expect that the Spanish regulatory framework would remain

unchanged.**° The Claimant’s lack of diligence rendered its expectations unrealistic and

lacking any objectivity. Therefore, a claim based on alleged breach of such expectations

must be dismissed.**°

Also, the Claimant’s expectations were unreasonable considering the regulatory
framework in place at the time of investment and its development thereafter. The regulatory
framework evolved between 1997 and 2008 in manner that revealed the possibility of
regulatory changes adversely affecting the remuneration of the Claimant’s wind farms, for

example, in the case of RD 436/2004.387

A diligent investor would know that Spain’s electricity system was governed by essential
principles, including, among others, the principle of regulatory hierarchy, the principle of
economic sustainability and the principle of reasonable return.*** These regulatory
standards were based on Law 54/1997 and the case law, not on RD 661/2007. A diligent
investor cannot legitimately expect that Spain would not adopt measures to resolve the
tariff deficit affecting the sustainability of the SES, or that public subsidies would be

maintained after the plants had achieved the corresponding target return.**?

The other sources referenced by the Claimant could not legitimately reinforce Claimant’s

expectations that the Special Regime would remain unchanged.

(i) The competence to set the regulatory regime of the remuneration of electricity
production lies with the state, not the Autonomous Communities, as provided by
Article 3(1)(c) of Law 54/1997. Therefore, neither an administrative act from the
Autonomous Communities of Galicia and Asturias nor any alleged guarantee from
their President could generate a legitimate expectation that the regulatory regime

would remain unchanged.*”°

7/2006 or RD 661/2007. Such registration was an administrative step required from
ordinary and special regime producers, to control their participation in the SES.
The tribunal in Charanne confirmed the view that such registration did not give
producers an acquired right to a rate so as to establish the expectation that such rate

would not be changed.*?!

The contracts that the Claimant signed with Spanish distributors cannot be
characterized as PPAs. These contracts simply established the settlement of the
subsidies that distributors paid to producers, for which the distributors were later
reimbursed by the regulator. The amounts paid under those contracts were
determined by the applicable regulations, and not by the distributor and the
producer. In any case, RD 661/2007 modified those contracts (the CNE taking over
the distributors’ settlement functions) and the contracts expressly contemplated the

possibility of the regulatory framework being modified.*”?

b. Spain created stable conditions for the Claimant’s investment

Spain argues that ‘stable conditions’ admit the adoption of reasonable and proportionate

macroeconomic control measures motivated by a reasonable cause, as supported by the

tribunals in Plama v. Bulgaria,*? AES Summit v. Hungary,*** and Mamidoil v. Albania”

The changes made to Special Regime aimed at guaranteeing the sustainability and balance

of the SES, to grant producers a reasonable return during their useful lives, as set out in the

PFER 2005-2010.°°°

Spain argues that the tribunals in Charanne and Eiser considered that the measures adopted

by a state were proportionate and did not breach the obligation to create stable conditions,

in so far as they did not suddenly and unexpectedly eliminate the essential features of the

regulatory framework in place.*?” Here, the Disputed Measures maintained the essential
nature of the regulatory framework, that is, investors can recover the cost of their
investment, operating costs and obtain a reasonable return, taking the costs of a standard
facility as reference.*”* A rational and objective understanding of the Spanish regulatory
framework indicates that an investor could form expectations concerning recovery of the
costs of the production of electricity only by reference to the costs incurred by a standard
facility. Yet, Spain argues, the tribunal in Eiser precisely failed to consider that essential

element of the Spanish regulatory framework.*””

Spain also created stable conditions, since the Disputed Measures were not retroactive.*°
For legislation to be retroactive, it must affect acquired rights, as decided by the tribunal in

Nations Energy v. Panama.*®!

The Claimant did not have acquired rights to receive
immutable tariffs. The Spanish Constitutional Court has repeatedly ruled that the measures
adopted since RD-Law 9/2013 apply to the future and are not retroactive, as they do not
affect acquired rights.*°?

Further, the tribunal in Blusun v. Italy found that, in the absence of express commitments
by a state, the obligation to create stable conditions does not prevent the state from
changing its regulations.*”° A distinction is to be made between contractual commitments
and expectations underlying a given relationship, ‘the latter are more matters to be taken
into account in applying other norms than they are norms in their own right.”4
Spain argues that this interpretation on the limits of a state’s regulatory power is directly
linked to the objective of the ECT to create an efficient energy market and to the stable

conditions standard of Article 10(1) of the ECT. According to Article 2 of the ECT, the

main objectives of the ECT are the need to ensure market efficiency, non-discrimination,
and market-led pricing. Article 9 of the ECT provides that nothing prevents a Contracting
Party from taking measures to ensure the integrity and stability of its financial system and
capital markets. Spain argues that these provisions should be considered when assessing
whether the measures complied with the obligation to create stable conditions.
The Disputed Measures have not prevented the Claimant from pursuing its economic

activity, with its plants operating normally .4°>

c. The Respondent’s position on the IRR

The Respondent argues that an analysis of the IRR proves that the Disputed Measures did
not have a negative impact on the Claimant’s investment and are therefore proportionate.

To this end it compares the project IRR to the WACC.

According to the Respondent, there is a difference between the project IRR and the
shareholder IRR. The former represents the return considering the operating cash flows
without taking into account how the project has been funded. It constitutes the internal rate
of return which will be earned on the project. According to Order IET/1045/2014 of 16
June 2014, the pre-tax project IRR in Spain should be about 7.398%. The latter represents
the return of the shareholders as generated by the project and constitutes the final return of
the shareholders taking into account both the cash flows and the funding of the project.*°”
Finally, according to the EC and an analysis of the market, a project IRR of 7.398% is

reasonable and proportionate.*°*

Moreover, the project IRR should be similar to the WACC, which constitutes a useful
comparator. The WACC is calculated by taking into account the cost demanded by

shareholders and the providers of external financing. This is then weighted against the total

financing costs. According to BDO’s calculations, the applicable WACC is 4.90% after
tax.” The applicable pre-tax WACC is 7.36%.4!°

To assess Eurus’s return rate, BDO assumed a useful life of 20 years over which the cash
flows of the investor have been taken into account.*!! Having assessed all available data,
BDO considers the pre-tax project IRR to be 15.15%.*!? This number is far higher than the
reasonable return under the new Spanish incentive regime or the pre-tax WACC.
Hence, there is no negative impact on the Claimant’s investment through the Disputed

Measures.‘

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

As noted in paragraph 240 above, the Tribunal will first consider Eurus’s claim under
Article 10(1) of the ECT, first and second sentence, on its merits, without reference to EU
state aid law. The analysis and conclusions set forth in this subsection (J 311-369) are
adopted by majority. Arbitrator Garibaldi dissents in respect of the overall conclusion and
most aspects of the supporting reasoning. The extent of the dissent and the reasons therefor

are stated in a Partially Dissenting Opinion, appended hereto.

a. The applicable ECT standard

Article 10(1) of the ECT, first and second sentences, provide in relevant part as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of
this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to
make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a
commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of
other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such
Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and
security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal.

313. These provisions have been extensively discussed in successive arbitral decisions,*!* and
there is little point in the Tribunal going over the same ground. But some general points

can be made.

314. The Claimant laid emphasis on the phrase ‘stable, equitable, favourable and transparent’
(Article 10(1) of the ECT, first sentence).‘'> But, as several tribunals have noted, the first
sentence of Article 10(1) cannot be interpreted in isolation from the second sentence.*!® It
does not give a general mandate to ECT tribunals to decide whether government decisions
affecting investments are ‘equitable’ or ‘favourable’, any more than the FET standard gives
a general discretion to BIT tribunals to impose their own views as to ‘fairness’ and ‘equity’.
The legal standard embodied in the first and second sentences of Article 10(1) takes into
account the prerogatives and responsibilities of governments as well as the rights and

interests of investors, including their interest in stability.

315. Of particular relevance by reason of its subsidies context (though it concerned PV power,

not wind) is the award of the tribunal in Blusun v. Italy. There the tribunal concluded:

In the absence of a specific commitment, the state has no obligation
to grant subsidies such as feed-in tariffs, or to maintain them
unchanged once granted. But if they are lawfully granted, and if it
becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in a manner
which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative

The tribunal went on to add:

These considerations apply even more strongly when the context is

subsidies or the payment of special benefits for particular economic

sectors.4!8
It may be objected that this formulation makes no reference to legitimate expectations,
which have become something of a /eitmotif in the case-law on the fair and equitable

treatment standard. The Blusun tribunal explained the matter in the following terms:

It is [...] true that a representation as to future conduct of the state
could be made in the form of a law, sufficiently clearly expressed.
But there is still a clear distinction between a law, i.e. a norm of
greater or lesser generality creating rights and obligations while it
remains in force, and a promise or contractual commitment. There
is a further distinction between contractual commitments and
expectations underlying a given relationship: however legitimate,
the latter are more matters to be taken into account in applying other
norms than they are norms in their own right. International law does
not make binding that which was not binding in the first place, nor
render perpetual what was temporary only.*!

On this view, legitimate expectations are essentially consideranda. The term itself does not
appear in the ECT, or for that matter in BITs, and there is no rule that legitimate
expectations are to be observed, analogous to the pacta sunt servanda rule in the law of
treaties. Rather, they are relevant factors to be taken into account in the interpretation and

application of treaty standards such as Article 10(1) of the ECT, first and second sentences.

The Blusun test was endorsed by both Parties in their pleadings.””°

b. The Article 10(1) standard applied to the Claimant’s Wind Farms

Applying the Blusun dictum, it is necessary to ask the following questions: (i) was there a
specific commitment of intangibility; (ii) absent a specific commitment, did the Claimant

entertain a legitimate expectation that subsidies would not be reduced during the lifetime

of the project; (iii) were the subsidies lawfully granted; (iv) were the changes of 2013-14
disproportionate to the legitimate aim of the legislative amendments; and (v) did they have
due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who had committed substantial
resources on the basis of the earlier regime. By way of summary, in the following sections,
the Tribunal answers these questions as follows: (i) no specific commitments were made;
(ii) the Claimant had legitimate expectations that subsidies would be continued in some
substantial form, but not that the subsidies regime of RD 661/2007 would be maintained
as such for the life of the investment; (iii) subject to EU law (considered below) the
subsidies were lawfully granted; (iv) in all but one respect (the claw-back of benefits
already paid) the Disputed Measures were not disproportionate, given the circumstances in
which they were imposed; (v) to the same effect, the changes, had they been applied

without the claw-back, had due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients.
In the following sub-sections, the Tribunal gives its reasons for these conclusions.

(i) Was there a specific commitment as to the FIT regime?

The Tribunal has already dealt with and rejected the argument that RAIPRE registration
itself implied a commitment to the Special Regime.*?! The Claimant expressly accepted
that there was no specific commitment made as to the immutability of the FIT regime under
RD 661/2007.*? In the Tribunal’s view, this is correct. Not only is it consistent with the

position taken by the Spanish courts in relation both to RD 436/2004*? and RD

#1 See above, [{] 260-265.

#2 Claimant did argue that Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 acted as a stabiliz:

ion clause, but it accepted that the amounts

 

payable by way of subsidy were not frozen but were the subject of a stability obligation in terms of the first sentence
of Art. 10(1) of the ECT: in effect a more flexible guarantee. See Cl. Mem., {{] 117, 119, 213; Cl. Reply, 4 246;
Hearing Day 5, p. 27,1 20; p. 29, 1 20; p. 311, Il 3ff; p. 33, II 3ff; p. 34, II Iff. Consistently with this, the Claimant
made no claim under ECT Article 10(1), final sentence (the umbrella clause). See also Claimant’s letter of 29 April
2019: ‘Spain [...] makes much of the RREEF decision’s holding that investors could not expect a frozen regulatory
regime, but of course this has no bearing whatsoever on the present proceeding, since Eurus has never contested that
right’ (emphasis in original).

#3 See above, [{] 266-269.

661/2007;*”4 it is also consistent with the conclusions reached by most of the tribunals

which have considered the matter.‘?°

322. A fortiori, the assurances said to have been given to Eurus Japan by the President of the
Xunta of Galicia on a visit to Japan*?® did not amount to specific commitments. Oral
statements made on promotional occasions are not sufficient for this purpose, quite apart
from the inevitable uncertainty as to just what was said. The Tribunal also accepts the
Respondent’s argument that a representative of an Autonomous Community had no
competence to create financial obligations of Spain regarding the SES.*”’ As a result, the
approval of EuroVento’s strategic long-term plan by Galicia’s Xunta and the government
of Asturias and the granting of Special Producer status to the Claimant’s SPCs also do not
give rise to legitimate expectations. Neither can the fact that Spanish state-owned utilities
entered into PPAs with the Claimant’s SPCs be seen as creating legitimate expectations

vis-a-vis the Spanish state.

(ii) What legitimate expectations did the Claimant have?

323. The Claimant did however argue that it had legitimate expectations that Spain would not
revoke or significantly weaken the Special Regime as applicable to existing projects, so

Eurus expected that the remuneration of RD 661/2007 would continue to apply to its

investment.**

324. In fact, all but one of the Claimant’s wind farms was commissioned before the entry into

force of RD 661/2007, the first three of them before even the enactment of the 1997 Law.*??

326.

In the Tribunal’s view, as a matter of general principle, a legitimate expectation is a form
of reliance interest which must relate to facts or circumstances in existence at the time the
investment is made.**? The Claimant argued that it is possible for expectations to be
enhanced by subsequent developments: for example, an investor could be seen as relying
on a new decree if the investment was maintained (as distinct from being sold) after the
decree was passed.**! Any such construction would imply that investors’ expectations
simply track the state of the law from time to time, and the idea of a reliance interest would
lose all autonomy. Moreover, the continuous updating of legitimate expectations that such
a theory would seem to imply cannot explain why expectations should always be enhanced
as distinct from being impaired by subsequent developments. If they can be as easily

destroyed as created, they would lose much of their value as a conduit of stability.

This is enough in itself to exclude the hypothesis of a legitimate expectation that the regime

of RD 661/2007 would be at least maintained for pre-existing projects.

On the other hand, express provisions in legislation as to future conduct are capable of
generating legitimate expectations, despite the generally valid distinction between laws and

promises.

In this respect, the Claimant refers to provisions which it submits ‘signalled Spain’s
long-term commitment to stability": the Preamble of RD 2818/1998, eight transitory
provisions of Law 54/1997, Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 and Article 44(3) of RD
661/2007. These last two provided that:

 

The tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements resulting from
any of the revisions provided for in this section shall apply solely to
the plants that commence operating subsequent to the date of the
entry into force referred to in the paragraph above and shall not have

have been performed.**+ (RD 661/2007, Article 44(3), 3rd sub-
paragraph)

328. The Claimant refers to Article 32 of RD 2818/1998:

Every four years, the premiums set in this chapter of this Royal
Decree and the values stipulated for the facilities covered by Royal
Decree 2366/1994 shall be revised, without prejudice to the
stipulations of the eighth transitory provision of [Law 54/1997], by
taking into account the evolution of the price of electric power on
the market, the participation of these facilities of demand and their
impact on the technical management of the system.**°

329. Even though the Claimant admitted that RD 1614/2010 did not have a significant effect on
its investment, it was the precursor of Spain’s overhaul. In this context, reference might

also be made to Article 5(3) of RD 1614/2010, which provided that:

Notwithstanding that established by this Royal Decree, for wind
technology facilities that come under Royal Decree 661/2007, of 25
May, revisions of tariffs and premiums, both upper and lower,
referred to by article 44.3 of the aforementioned Royal Decree will
not affect facilities entered definitively in the administrative
Register for production facilities operating under the special system
and reporting to the Directorate General of Energy Policy and Mines
on 7 May 2009 [...].4°°

330. Of particular importance is the Spanish Electric Power Law 54/1997, which was in force

until its repeal in 2013. Article 30(4) provided that:

installations operating under the special regime shall be

supplemented by the payment of a premium under statutory terms

improvement, to primary energy saving and energy efficiency, [...]
and the investment costs incurred shall all be taken into account so
as to achieve reasonable profitability rates with reference to the cost
of money on capital markets.*°” (emphasis added)

331. Inthe Tribunal’s view, this Law stated a coherent general principle and is inconsistent with
the thesis that particular Royal Decrees, notably RD 661/2007, stabilized the regime.
The 1997 Law was to be implemented by regulations which would likely to change and

did change, and not in any uniform direction favouring the recipients.

332. In particular, there was no legitimate expectation that subsidies would never be reduced or
capped. Some decrees grandfathered existing plants, but others did not, and although
grandfathering may be best practice, it is not in the Tribunal’s view required by the ECT.
In this regard, this Tribunal disagrees with the tribunal in Cube which was of the view that
references to a reasonable return did not ‘signified a limit on the profit that a producer
could earn’.**8 Nor does the Tribunal accept that the three ‘grandfather clauses’ cited above

established any general principle, as also held by the tribunal in RREEF.**°

333. The Claimant could not have had legitimate expectations to the remuneration of RD
661/2007, since most of its plants were commissioned between March 1997 and May 2006,

and only one was commissioned in February 2008. More specifically, four of Claimant’s

5,440

projects were commissioned after 15 December 200. while the other projects were

limit on the profit that a producer could earn from any power facility or group of facilities without suffering a reduction

commissioned between March 1997 and February 2005. From December 2005 onwards,
the Supreme Court said that a specific remuneration system could be changed as long as

the changes made were within the framework of the 1997 Law.*"!

The parties disagreed sharply on the relationship between the ‘reasonable return’ provision
stated in Article 30(4) of the 1997 Law and the successive subsidy regimes established by
royal decree.*#” In the Tribunal’s view, this is a false dichotomy. Article 30(4) of the 1997
Law stated a general principle and empowered the administration to give effect to it by
regulation. The stream cannot rise higher than its source or commit the state to more than
the legislative framework allows. A requirement that the remuneration system be such as
to allow recipients ‘to achieve reasonable profitability rates with reference to the cost of
money on capital markets’ is general in its terms, but it is perfectly intelligible and imposes

some limits on what can be done.

(iii) Were those legitimate expectations violated by the Disputed Measures?

Turning to the question of breach, it follows from the analysis of legitimate expectations
in paragraphs 323-334 above that it is not sufficient for the Claimant to show that certain
expectations were impaired or affected by the measures complained of. To recall the point

made specifically with regard to subsidies in Blusun:

[I]f it becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in a
manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative
amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable reliance
interests of recipients who may have committed substantial
resources on the basis of the earlier regime.

Thus, it is necessary to assess the proportionality of the change in financial arrangements

and whether it had due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients of subsidies.

the exercise of the regulatory powers and of the broad entitlements it has in a strongly regulated iss

As to the aim of the Disputed Measures, the primary reason given, then and now, was to
address the deficit on the tariff account of the SES (as to which see paragraphs 131-134
above). This had already been declared to be ‘unsupportable’ in 2009, and by 2013 had
reached nearly EUR 40 billion.“ This was not really contested by Eurus, which instead
argued that other measures (notably, increased customer tariffs) could have been adopted
to deal with the problem, and that the RE producers should not have been required to bear
the whole burden of cuts. Eurus also noted that the Respondent had not made a formal plea
of necessity as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness under the law of state
responsibility.44° That observation, while true, does not exhaust the relevance of the tariff

deficit as the major underlying factor leading to the Disputed Measures.

In the Tribunal’s view, the growing deficit on the energy account was unsustainable.
Moreover, it is not for the Tribunal to second guess reasonable measures taken to address
the deficit (including measures affecting existing plants), to propose alternative policies
that could have been adopted, or to weigh up for itself the competing demands of generators
and consumers. If the measures were ‘not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative
amendment, and [had] due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may
have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime’, they would be
consistent with the FET standard in Article 10(1). Applying that standard, it is necessary

to differentiate between different aspects of the Disputed Measures.

(iti) (a) Regulatory rather than actual plant life (20 years rather than 25 or 30
years)?
In its Memorial, the Claimant summarized its expectation as follows: ‘Eurus expected that
the Incentives Regime would not be worsened or taken away in respect of any particular

project for the duration of the project’s operational lifetime.’

With its Memorial, Eurus presented an expert report by Exponent.” Exponent was asked
to evaluate the operational life of wind turbines on the Claimant’s wind farms. Exponent
concluded that the Claimant’s wind farms would at a minimum have a 30-year operational
life.“8 Based on the findings of Exponent, the Claimant instructed Brattle to project future
cash flows for each SPC on the assumption that the wind farms would operate for
30-years.*? This instruction of 30-year operational lifetime was confirmed at the hearing

by the testimony of the Claimant’s quantum expert Mr. Caldwell,**°

as well as by one of
the Claimant’s regulatory experts, Mr. Garcia.**! In its first Regulatory Report, Brattle
states that ‘the New Regulatory Regime limits the financial incentive to wind farms to the
first 20 years of operation. In contrast, RD 661/2007 [...] applied for a wind farm’s entire
useful life, which in the case of Eurus’ wind farms, we understand is projected to exceed
30 years.’** The Claimant argues that Spain failed to submit evidence to challenge the
30-year operational lifetime analysis provided by Exponent.**? On cross-examination, with

regard to the statement of Brattle’s first Regulatory Report, Mr. Garcia was asked:

MS. RIVAS KORTAZAR: Do you recall that, as we have seen at
the beginning, those 20 years of useful life was the same reference
as used by the Renewable Energy Plan from the year 2005-2010?

DR. GARCIA: No, I wouldn’t agree with that general statement.
I would say that it was the regulatory life defined in the Renewable
Energy Plans, not necessarily the useful life of the plant. There’s a
distinction between the regulatory life and the useful life.

MS. RIVAS KORTAZAR: I agree with that point. Indeed, the
disputed measures refer as well to the regulatory life of the plants;
do you agree on that? To a regulatory life of 20 years for wind
farms?

DR. GARCIA: Yes.**

In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent objected to the Claimant’s expectation*®> that
‘the Regulated Tariff would apply to the whole operational life of the facilities.’*° Spain
explains that the New Regime’s remuneration system is complemented by the regulatory
lifetime of a standard facility. The end of the regulatory life sets the time at which a
standard facility has reached the reasonable return set by the Regulator, i.e. when the
standard facility has recovered its investment and operation costs through the subsidies

received.**”

At the Hearing, Spain’s expert Mr. MacGregor stated that ‘[t]he useful life is generally
taken from the accounts: they show useful lives of between 18 years and 25 years, but
generally 20 years.’ Also, he stated that the financial models produced by the Claimant
before undertaking the investments assumed a 20-year life and that Spain’s Renewable
Energy Plan looked at a 20-year useful life for wind farms, without there being any support

for the 30-year life argued by the Claimant.***

On this issue, the Tribunal is inclined to disagree with the Respondent. Earlier regulations
had been clear that the incentives regime would last for longer than 20 years, though
possibly at a reduced level.** There is a case for 25 years as a reasonable target. Although
none of the following cases involved wind turbines (but rather CSP plants), all the
tribunals considered the useful life of renewable energy plants under the Spanish regulatory

regime to be 25 years:

° In Antin, the tribunal noticed that the evidence submitted was inconsistent and the
assumed lifetime spanned from 20 to up to 40 years. In particular, the Tribunal
noted that substantial repairs to the plants had to be made after 25 years, which

would affect the subsidy according to Article 4.3 of RD 661/2007. Based on the

evidence submitted, the tribunal decided that the useful life of the plants is

25 years.*°!

° In Eiser, the tribunal was not convinced by the documentary record submitted to it,
which was limited and inconsistent. However, the primary document used, an
expert due diligence report, was supportive of a 25-year life. Therefore, the tribunal

rejected the claim that the plants were designed for a 40-year life.*°

. In the same vein, the Masdar tribunal assumed a life of 25 years rejecting the
claimant’s claim as to a 40-year operational life based on the weight of the

evidence, which contradicted the claimant’s assertion.*°

. Finally, the RREEF tribunal agreed with other tribunals that have faced this issue
and decided that the useful life of CSP plants should be considered to be 25 years,

which corresponds to the claimant’s initial assessments before the dispute arose.**

Based on the above, the Tribunal considers a 25-year life to be adequate for the wind plants.

(iii) (b) The ‘standard facility’ as a basis for calculation?

The Claimant argued that its legitimate expectations related to its own plants: to adopt
another standard of calculation, without regard of actual costs, characteristics or production
levels, deprived Eurus of the benefit of its prudent investment and management of the
plants.*® On the other hand, Spain had to deal with some 6,000 wind plants, not to mention
other RE facilities; there were elements in earlier legislation of calculations based on

6

standard facilities,“° and it was not unreasonable, at least for the future, to calculate

subsidies on the basis of standard facilities, adapted to the method of power generation.

2005-2010 (Hearing Day 3, p. 83, Il 4-25, p. 84, II 1-9 (Mr. Lapuerta)). As stated at paragraph 100 above, the PFER
1989 to PFER 2005-2010 used the concept of standard facility.

107

In the end, in the Tribunal’s view, this aspect of the Disputed Measures did not breach

Article 10(1) of the ECT.

(iii) (c) ‘Retrospectivity’ and the claw-back

346. The Spanish courts held that the Disputed Measures were not retrospective, and that finding
is entitled to some deference.**’ Moreover, Spain did not claw back money actually paid
above the total allowable amount of subsidies: the claw-back was in the nature of a set-off

rather than a counterclaim. In the words of the Brattle First Regulatory Report:

Our view is that the New Regulatory Regime reduces the
remuneration to those installations that were already operating under
the Original Regulatory Regime. Although technically the
installations do not have to ‘pay back any amount’, reducing the
future remuneration based on past gains is tantamount to asking to
reimburse these gains, since the investors are being forced to offset
what they have already earned against the remuneration due under
the New Regulatory Regime.**

347. In short, the Disputed Measures took into account earlier subsidies for the purpose of
assessing future payments, resulting in no entitlements for 11 of the Claimant’s
13 facilities. This is a weaker form of retrospectivity, but the label ‘retrospective’ is not

crucial: what matters is the substance.

348. The Respondent argues that the Disputed Measures were not retroactive because they did

not affect acquired rights:

[T]he Claimant has never had an ‘acquired right’ to a remuneration
in the future, sine die, by means of a fixed and unchanging FIT, not

illuminating dissents on the topic of retrospectivity; e.g. Judge Espin Templado, p. 37: ‘The system itself, however,
applies as if it had been in force from the very first moment that each facility commenced its regulatory life. In my
opinion that retroactive projection, which set le the in tempore application of the system in force prior to [2014],
as though the latter had never existed, and the fact that the new regulation is considerably less favourable for the
facilities concerned, amount to a serious abuse of judicial certainty [...]’.

subject to possible macroeconomic control measures or reforms of
the SES. As shown above, the reform contained in RD-Act 9/2013
is only effective in the future, without affecting acquired rights*°
349. The Tribunal agrees, for reasons already given, that there was no acquired right to
remuneration in future, still less to ‘a fixed and unchanging FIT’. But that is not the point.
It is one thing to amend payments for future production with immediate effect, and another
to reduce payments that would have otherwise been made by reference to payments
lawfully made in the past in respect of past production. Again, what matters is not the label

‘retrospective’ but the substance.

350. The Respondent also relies on the decision of the tribunal in Nations Energy v. Panama.”
That was an expropriation claim concerning substantial restrictions on the right to rely on
investment tax credits under a new law, which the claimant alleged had retroactive effect,
contrary to the Panamanian Constitution. The tribunal held that the claimants did not have
the right that they claimed to transfer their tax credits. But even if they had such right, the
new legislation did not revoke or cancel it, let alone retroactively: the claimants were still
entitled to the full amount of their tax credits. Only the conditions under which they could
be relied on were modified, inter alia by sharply lowering the annual cap. The tribunal
added that the new legislation ‘would have been retroactive [...] if it had reincorporated
in the tax rate the deductions previously made, or [...] if it had disavowed existing

n47

credits. Tribunal’s translation]

351. The decision concerned a situation remote from the present one: it involved an
expropriation claim under a BIT, not a claim to breach of the legal stability guarantee in
Article 10 of the ECT. The passage italicized above shows, however, that the distinction
between immediately operative and retrospective measures is a far from simple one. There
is an analogy between a law which disallows deductions already made (affecting future tax
liabilities) and a law which deducts subsidies already lawfully paid from future

entitlements to subsidies.

Different tribunals in Spanish RE cases have reached different conclusions on the
retrospectivity point. In Charanne, which concerned only the 2010 regulations, the tribunal
rejected the retrospectivity argument, which the claimant there had presented in the form
of a claim to a vested right that the regulatory framework could not be altered ‘in any way’.
The tribunal formulated the question as being ‘to what extent the State can modify, with
immediate effect, generally applicable regulatory provisions.’*”* But although the claimant
may have put it in these terms, that is not the question. The Tribunal agrees that there was
no contractual right or legitimate expectation to an unchanging subsidy in any form, and it
agrees that (subject to considerations of proportionality) Article 10(1) did not preclude new
regulations from having immediate effect. But it is one thing to give new regulatory
measures immediate effect for existing installations, and quite another to eliminate future
subsidies otherwise payable by reference to amounts lawfully paid and received in earlier

years on a quite different basis.
The /solux tribunal took a similar position, also relying on Nations Energy v. Panama.

The matter was central to the decision in RREEF. The tribunal there emphasized that the
claimants acquired a right to a ‘general regime guaranteeing the essential advantages they
could reasonably expect when they made their investments.’*”* Furthermore, the tribunal
had ‘no hesitation to find that the Respondent acted in breach of its obligation to respect
the principle of stability’ by applying the Disputed Measures retroactively.4”>
More precisely, according to the tribunal, the Disputed Measures took into account past
remuneration under the previous regime and deducted them from future payments. This has
the effect of clawing back remuneration to which the investor had a right at the time the

payment was made.*7°

The Tribunal takes note of this analysis*”” and considers that the subsidies paid in earlier
years were duly paid and duly taken into account in the operation of the SPCs, in their
financing and (presumably) their taxation arrangements. To claw back those profits on the
basis of a subsequent judgment that they were ‘excessive’ would seem inconsistent with
the principle of stability in Article 10(1) of the ECT and has not been shown to have been
necessary to resolve the tariff deficit problem, which would have been solved in any event
by the Disputed Measures without much further delay and without the element of
claw-back. It may have been reasonable to take into account, in calculating subsidies going
forward, the 7.398% pre-tax that the Plants were deemed to be entitled to under the
Disputed Measures. To count against them the amounts previously earned would be to
penalise the Plants for their successful operation during those years. For these reasons, the
Tribunal holds that, insofar as the claw-back operation is concerned, Spain breached

Article 10(1) of the ECT.“

(iv) Were the Disputed Measures proportionate?
(iv) (a) The RREEF standard on IRR

Turning to the proportionality of the Disputed Measures, it is necessary to analyse their
impact on the returns generated by the Claimant’s investments. For reasons already given
(paragraphs 354-355 above), this Tribunal agrees with the RREEF tribunal that the only
legitimate expectation the Claimant could have had was that of a ‘reasonable return’ in
terms of the 1997 Law.‘ In particular, the Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant
had a legitimate expectation to the regime of RD 661/2007, which (a) was not in force
when all but the most recent investments were made by the Claimant, (b) was not the

subject of a stabilization regime, and (c) was subordinate to the 1997 Law.

477 Tt may be observed that in its comment of 17 April 2019 in response to the RREEF decision, Spain asserts (without

specifically mentioning the claw-back issue) that ‘the statements and conclusions of the RREEF [dlecis

 

 

mn are

applicable to this arbitration’ (4 2), and refers to its ‘correct damages approach’ (§ 5). The Claimant states that
retroactivity was ‘obviously a violation of [the] ECT’ (Response of 29 April 2019, 5), while arguing that there were
other breaches.

478 For the impact of EU law, see below, {{{ 391-414. For the implications of this conclusion for quantum, see below,

357. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the decision in RREEF that the Claimant is entitled

to

compensation for unreasonable return on their investments — if
established — [...] [but] cannot claim full compensation for the total
decrease in their profits as a result of the adoption of the new regime
by the Respondent; they can only get compensation to the extent that
such decrease is below the threshold of a reasonable return.**”

358. The RREEF tribunal conducted its proportionality analysis under the rubric ‘The Principle
of Damages’ in the section of its Decision dealing with quantum. It did so on the ground
that ‘the determination of a violation of the principles of proportionality and reasonableness
is inseparable from an assessment of the damages — if any — endured by the Claimants as a
consequence of the measures taken by the Respondent.’#*! The two are closely connected
in practice, but nonetheless the question of disproportionality pertains to the merits —
whether there has been a breach in the first place — and not to issues of quantum, which are
consequential. This difference of principle is important in practice because it is only if the
breach is identified with precision that the question of reparation for that breach can be

approached.

359. It is notable that the Parties and their experts treated the question of quantum in an
essentially undifferentiated way, as the amount of loss suffered by the Claimant as a result
of the Disputed Measures globally. That led them to identify the amount of reparation
owing by reference to an undifferentiated ‘but for’ situation.*** For the Claimant’s experts

this was the status quo ante, the regime of RD 661/2007.**° But if the Claimant had no

483 In CE-5, the Brattle Rebuttal Quantum Report, the Claimant’s expert puts forward two alternative valuations. In the
Rebuttal Quantum Report, {| 175ff, Brattle changed 6 incorrect parameters used in BDO’s alternative DCF
calculation, the most important of which was the application of RD 661/2007’s tariffs, this change alone increases

Report, {| 208ff, Brattle a: d the amount of damages that the Claimant would be entitled to in an alternative
scenario, where the Claimant would have been entitled to a reasonable return instead of fixed tariffs. Brattle calculated
an alternative but-for scenario with a 7% after tax return over a 20-year regulatory useful life period. Brattle then
calculated an alternative tariff per MWh produced and applied it to the production forecasted to each SPC. Based on
that methodology, Brattle offers two alternative figures: a) damages for EUR 237 million, assuming a but-for scenario
where the same tariff applies to all plants; b) damages for EUR 120 million, assuming different tariffs per MWh

right to the continuation of that regime, it cannot have acquired any such right by reference
to the secondary rules of reparation. The venerable dictum of the Permanent Court of
International Justice in Chorzéw Factory does not guarantee the continuation of a factual

situation (the Special Regime) to which the Claimant was not otherwise entitled.***

The question thus becomes whether the Disputed Measures operated

in a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the
legislative amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable
reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial
resources on the basis of the earlier regime.**°

To examine the proportionality of the Disputed Measures, the Tribunal agrees with the
RREFF tribunal that the relevant measure is the internal rate of return (‘IRR’):

Since the Tribunal has determined that the only legitimate

expectation of which the Claimants could prevail themselves was

that of a ‘reasonable return’, it is appropriate to compare both

regimes depending on the IRR that the Claimants can get under each

of them. As the Novenergia tribunal put it, ‘the internal rates of

return is a relevant measurement for what the Claimant was

expecting to get from its investment in the Kingdom of Spain at the

time of making the investment.’**°
According to the Respondent’s experts, the IRR equates to the ‘reasonable return’ as
provided for by the provisions of the Spanish regulatory regime.**’ Investors take the IRR
into account and compare it to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to decide on
the profitability of a potential investment. If the project IRR is higher than the required rate
of return it follows that the cash flows generated by the investment will cover the costs

associated with the project.*** In principle, the Tribunal agrees with this assessment. If the

produced by each SPC, based on the remuneration code assigned to each SPC under the New Regime. This second
scenario accepts most of Spain’s assumptions for the calculation of damages.

project IRR exceeds a reasonable return, the Disputed Measures would be proportionate

and would not breach Article 10(1) of the ECT.

(iv) (b) The project IRR under Spain’s Special Regime

As stated by the Parties, there is a difference between the project IRR and the shareholder
IRR. Whereas the ECT protects shareholders’ rights and accords different protection
standards to them, the Tribunal agrees with the Parties that the relevant IRR targeted by
the notion of legitimate expectation to a reasonable return is the project IRR over the useful

lifetime of the plants.

Yet the Parties do not agree on the project IRR under the Special Regime. This Tribunal
needs not determine the exact IRR before the entry into force of the Disputed Measures.
Nonetheless, it notes that the IRR under the new incentives regime is lower than under the
initial regime, and not surprisingly. As already held by the Tribunal, the Respondent has
the right to modify and amend its regulations, i.e. the amount of the targeted IRR, as long

as they remain reasonable and do not breach the ECT.

The RREEF tribunal calculated a reasonable rate of return at 6.86% including a 1%
supplementary premium.**? That is well below the Claimant’s IRR in the present case, even

if all of Brattle’s criticisms of BDO’s IRR analysis are accepted.

The Tribunal does not take any position on the exact amount of the reasonable return. This
return can change over time depending on various factors. The Respondent emphasizes
that the reasonable return is a ‘dynamic’ concept.*”? The Tribunal agrees. The term
‘reasonable’ allows the state to accommodate a change in these factors instead of fixing
the IRR at a certain number. Nonetheless, the Tribunal notes that even if the Claimant had

a legitimate expectation of an IRR of 6.86%, the actual IRR clearly exceeded that amount.

The Parties’ positions as to the project IRR are set out in the table below:*”!

368. The Tribunal notes that the Parties do not agree on the total project IRR. However, it is not
in dispute that the actual return targeted by the Disputed Measures is a 7.398% pre-tax
project IRR.*”? According to Brattle’s Rebuttal Report and BDO Workpaper F, the total
IRR after the enactment of the Disputed Measures as calculated by BDO is 15.1%.4°
The total IRR as calculated by Brattle is 12.5%. The average of both numbers is 13.8%,
which is well above the 7.398% target of the Spanish regulator.

369. The Tribunal therefore decides that the Respondent has not breached its obligation to
ensure a reasonable return. Thus, the Claimant’s legitimate expectation to a reasonable

return has not been frustrated.

SPAIN’S ALLEGED BREACH OF ARTICLE 10(1) OF THE ECT, THIRD SENTENCE

The Claimant also argues that the Disputed Measures unreasonably impaired Claimant’s
investment, in breach of Article 10(1) third sentence, of the ECT, which provides in

relevant part that the investments:

[...] shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and
no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment or disposal.***

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. The Claimant

The Claimant submits that Article 10(1) third sentence of the ECT is an ‘unreasonable or
discriminatory measures’ clause, which is breached if a state measure does not follow a

rational policy or is not a reasonable implementation of such a policy.‘

More specifically, the Claimant relies on the dictum in BG Group v. Argentina, where the

tribunal held that:

Unilateral withdrawal by Argentina of [the] key components of the

Regulatory Framework was from the perspective of the [applicable

treaty] unreasonable and it was therefore in breach of [the treaty’s

unreasonable measures clause].4°°
The Claimant applies this principle to the Disputed Measures. It argues that the Disputed
Measures withdraw key components of the Special Regime and reduced the value of the
investment by two-thirds. As a result, the Disputed Measures impaired the investment in

an unreasonable way.*””

The Claimant also rejects the Respondent’s arguments. It maintains that first, the Disputed

Measures were not required by macroeconomic circumstances; second, no RE producer

endorsed the Disputed Measures; and third, current rates of investment are irrelevant as to

the reasonableness of the Disputed Measures.**

375. As to Spain’s first argument, the Claimant responds that the Disputed Measures were not
necessary to solve the issues arising out of the tariff deficit because the payment of
subsidies did not threaten the sustainability of Spain’s electricity system.*” An alternative
solution would have been to raise electricity prices.» Furthermore, Spain cannot rely on
changes in the interest rates on government bonds to argue necessity because there were

no relevant changes.*?!

376. As to Spain’s second argument, neither the renewable energy industry’s main association
(APPA), nor Greenpeace, nor any player of the renewable energies market regarded the
reform as desirable or urgently needed.*°? The Claimant notes that Spain relies on a
proposal of 2009 (‘2009 Draft Law’) made by APPA, which, according to Spain, largely
resembles the changes eventually introduced by Spain.°°* But, the Claimant argues that the
2009 Draft Law excluded retroactivity of any measures; it made explicit that any changes
would not affect existing plants, which would be entitled to maintain the economic scheme
applicable.** Even the European Commission expressed concern as to whether the
Disputed Measures could achieve their objectives and contribute to the 2020 targets.>°

Participants in the renewable energy sector such as the Spanish Wind Power Business

Association, the Spanish Renewable Energy Business Association and independent

consultants that evaluated the new regime noted errors and had serious doubts about the

Disputed Measures.*°°

As to Spain’s third argument, the Claimant reiterates that the harmful impact of the
Disputed Measures was to existing wind plants. The costs when making the investment
were different from current costs (they were much higher), and therefore current rates of

investment were irrelevant for existing investors such as Eurus.°°”

b. The Respondent

The Respondent contends that the Disputed Measures were not discriminatory,
unreasonable or disproportionate. In rejecting the claim, the Respondent makes three

points.

First, the Claimant has the burden of proof of a breach of Article 10(1) third sentence, and,
Spain argues, Eurus has failed to meet the standard of proof.*°* The worsening of the tariff
deficit, required the Respondent to take necessary steps to resolve the situation. The
Respondent points also to the principle of sustainability of the SES, the worsening of the
economic crisis, the exceptional decline in electricity demand, the existence of
overcompensation in the RE sector, and Spain’s bail-out commitments undertaken with the
EU. Thus, according to Spain, the measures were reasonable in the circumstances to

address the tariff deficit and rebalance the system.*”?

Second, not only did APPA endorse the Disputed Measures but so did most domestic and
foreign investors. For example, the Disputed Measures’ remuneration system was in line
with that proposed by APPA in the 2009 Draft Law. Also, international organizations made
positive assessments of the Disputed Measures. This evidences that the Disputed Measures

were a reasonable and proportionate response in the circumstances.°!°

Finally, the Respondent relies on statements of the tribunals in EDF v. Romania,!! AES

512

Summit v. Hungary?'? and Total v. Argentina>'? to support the conclusion that the Disputed

Measures were neither discriminatory nor unreasonable.>!*

Relying on EDF v. Romania, Spain submits that the Disputed Measures are compliant with
the FET standard because they were (i) adopted to serve the legitimate purpose of solving
the imbalance created by the tariff deficit, without burdening consumers in the midst of an
economic crisis; (ii) based on the legal standards set out in the applicable regulatory
framework and the jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court, and were not on prejudice
or personal preference; (iii) adopted to guarantee sustainability, a reason stated in the

regulatory framework; and (iv) adopted following due process.

Relying on AES Summit v. Hungary, Spain argues that the Disputed Measures are a
reasonable response to a public policy objective. They formed macroeconomic control
measures to reduce the tariff deficit and ensure the sustainability of the SES. According to
Spain, the tribunal in Eiser v. Spain supported this view.>!> In Total v. Argentina, the
tribunal found that in sectors involving long-term investment with large amounts of capital,
a state’s change of its legal framework complies with the FET standard if the investor can
recover its operational costs, amortize its investment and obtain a reasonable rate of return.
According to Spain, these criteria are met, since the Disputed Measures affected all
operators, offering a reasonable return of 7.398% before tax, in line with Spain’s public

policy objectives.>!

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Under Article 10(1) third sentence of the ECT, States have to provide on constant

protection and security while also ensuring that ‘the management, maintenance, use,

387.

enjoyment or disposal of the investment is not impaired by unreasonable or discriminatory

measures’.

Article 10(1) third sentence appears to have a twofold sense. In the first place, it obliges
the state to ensure the physical protection of the investment, safeguarding it against
violence and harassment; in this respect, at least, it is not a re-statement of the fair and
equitable treatment standard in different words. This was the view of similar clauses taken
by numerous tribunals, including Noble Ventures v. Romania,>"" Tecmed v. Mexico,>!8 APL

v. Sri Lanka,>'? Wena Hotels v. Egypt,°° AMT v. Zaire>*' and Eureko v. Poland”

Here there is no evidence that Eurus’s investment has suffered from any physical harm or
deterioration through the Disputed Measures and Eurus has not suggested otherwise.
Moreover, there is no evidence that Eurus’s management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or
disposal of the wind plants, as distinct from its income and thus its value, have been

impaired by the change of the Incentives Regime.

Secondly, the provision expressly refers to unreasonable or discriminatory measures. In the
Tribunal’s view, unreasonable or discriminatory measures in the general sense are
examples of measures that breach the FET standard as contained in Article 10(1), first and
second sentences. It agrees with the tribunal in RREEF, which analysed the alleged
discriminatory character of the Disputed Measures and issues of proportionality and

reasonableness as part of the FET claim.>?? The RREEF tribunal decided that:

[T]here can be no doubt that [...], (iii) non-impairment including

(iv) non-discrimination and (v) proportionality and reasonableness,

are elements of the FET — and certainly so under the ECT.°*4
No conclusive evidence was provided to necessitate a finding of unreasonableness or
discrimination under those elements of the FET standard, save insofar as the retro-active
aspect of the Disputed Measures, in the form of the claw-back clause is concerned. In
absence of any persuasive argument to the contrary, no separate finding of

unreasonableness or discrimination under Article 10(1), third sentence, can be made.

In the light of the above, nothing further remains to be decided as regards the claim under

Article 10(1), third sentence, of the ECT.

(3) Conclusions on Article 10(1) of the ECT

For these reasons the Tribunal concludes that to the extent the Disputed Measures were
applied clawing back subsidies paid before their adoption, they form a breach of Article
10(1) first and second sentence of the ECT. In all other respects, no breach has occurred.
But, as already noted (paragraphs 235-236 above), this conclusion concerns the ECT in the

absence of EU law, notably the EU rules concerning state aid. To this the Tribunal turns.

THE EU STATE AID ARGUMENTS
(1) Introduction

According to Spain, EU law has a specific relevance to the claim, in that EU state aid law,
which is part of Spanish law, has the effect that the Claimant did not have, and could not
have had, any legitimate expectation of receiving Special Regime subsidies, still less that
they were fixed at the level of RD 661/2007.°% Moreover, Spain argues that the EC’s
decision of 10 November 2017 authorizing the Disputed Measures as permissible state
aid” entails that compliance with any award of this Tribunal requiring Spain to make

payments in excess of those provided by those Measures would itself constitute

impermissible state aid and would trigger the stand-still obligation in Article 108(3) of the
TFEU.*””

At the hearing the Claimant briefly refuted these arguments.***

The Parties elaborated further in their responses of 31 January 2019 to the EC’s Application
of 29 October 2018, which in accordance with Procedural Order No. 7 became part of the
record of this arbitration, even though the EC in the event chose not to intervene.>”? Before
setting out its views on these issues, the Tribunal will first summarise the arguments

thereby presented.

(2) The EC’s application insofar as it concerns state aid

In its Application for leave to intervene as a non-disputing party, the EC argued that the
incentives regime constituted unlawful state aid pursuant to Article 107(1) of the TFEU
because it had not been notified to, still less authorised by, the EC itself. Therefore, in
accordance with the consistent jurisprudence of the CJEU, the Claimant could not have
had any legitimate expectation that the incentives regime was lawful. This entailed that

the Claimant could not have the legitimate expectation that aid be granted.**”

Finally, the EC reiterated that if Spain were to comply with an award in favour of the
Claimant, the payment would constitute state aid under Article 108(3) of the TFEU and

would be subject to the standstill obligation.**!

a. The Claimant’s response

The Claimant puts forward three reasons to reject the argument that it could not have

developed any legitimate expectations in the matter due to the incompatibility of the

Special Regime with EU law on state aid. First, Spain itself never considered the Special
Regime to constitute state aid. Second, the possibility that the Special Regime under the
1997 Act could have been reviewed by the EC or the CJEU does not mean that the Claimant
cannot rely on the regime until it has been reviewed (which never happened). Third, the
state aid issue played no role in Spain’s decision to introduce the Disputed Measures and
the risk, in the event unrealised, that subsidies paid under the Special Regime could be
considered unlawful state aid and recovered as such did not render the Claimant’s

expectations under the ECT illegitimate.**?

As to the first reason, Spain aggressively promoted the RE Special Regime, stressing the
EC’s support of the scheme to attract investors. To all appearances, neither Spain nor the
EC believed that the Special Regime could be contrary to EU law, and neither of them
acted on that view. The Claimant maintains that by not notifying the regime to the EC,
Spain in effect communicated to the investors that the incentives regime was lawful under
EU law. Furthermore, the Claimant conducted due diligence as required under the ECT
and international law. Although that due diligence did not address EU law on state aid, that
very fact (according to the Claimant) is itself consistent with Spain’s and the EC’s initial

view that this was not state aid.**

As to the second reason, the Claimant argues that the fact that a measure can be reviewed
through domestic processes, including the EC, does not mean that the Claimant cannot rely
on that measure. In support, the Claimant refers to the decision in SPP v. Egypt, in which

the tribunal held that:

It is possible that under Egyptian law certain acts of Egyptian
officials [...] may be considered legally nonexistent or null and void
or susceptible to invalidation. However, these acts were cloaked
with the mantle of Governmental authority and communicated as
such to foreign investors who relied on them in making their
investments.

Whether legal under Egyptian law or not, the acts in question were
the acts of Egyptian authorities, including the highest executive

authority of the Government. These acts, which are now alleged to

have been in violation of the Egyptian municipal legal system,

created expectations protected by established principles of

international law. A determination that these acts are null and void

under municipal law would not resolve the ultimate question of

liability for damages suffered by the victim who relied on the acts.>*4
Similarly, by its conduct in promoting and repeatedly affirming the Special Regime, Spain
nurtured the Claimant’s expectations as to its lawfulness, and the availability of a review

mechanism at EU level does not render those expectations illegitimate.**°

Third, the Claimant argues that the fact that the EC could have declared the Special Regime
incompatible with EU law is of no importance since this did not happen. For 15 years,
Spain did not question the lawfulness of the Special Regime. Even if the Claimant had
considered the Special Regime to constitute illegal state aid (which it did not), Spain would
still be responsible for any damage caused to the Claimant’s investment, because it would
then have failed to provide stable, favourable and transparent conditions for Eurus’s

investment.>*°

Finally, the Claimant submits that an award in Eurus’s favour would not constitute
unlawful state aid. This is because by not enforcing such an award, the EU and its member

states would violate their obligations under the ECT.**”
b. The Respondent’s response
Spain stresses two points in relation to the state aid issue, while generally endorsing the

EC’s position.

First, Spain reiterates that the Claimant did not have and could not have any legitimate
expectations of receiving Special Regime subsidies. The EC has declared the incentives

regime to constitute state aid.*** The consequence of this declaration, which is binding on

54 CL-0016, SPP v. Egypt, {{[ 82, 83. Also relevant there was the finding that the Egyptian authorities subsequently

the Tribunal under the applicable law, is not the repayment of the subsidies to Spain but
the exclusion of any legitimate expectations to the payment of the state aid.**? Therefore,

the Claimant’s legitimate expectations have not been breached.*°

Second, Spain emphasises that the EC expressly stated in its decision of 10 November 2017
that any compensation awarded to the Claimant would constitute unauthorised state aid
pursuant to Article 108(3) of the TFEU. On that basis, an award in Eurus’s favour could

not be enforced, at least within the EU.**!

(3) The Tribunal’s conclusions on state aid
a. EU law on state aid

The analysis that follows is adopted by majority. Arbitrator Garibaldi concurs in the
decision to the extent that EU rules on state aid are not an impediment to the Claimant’s
claims but dissents in respect of other aspects of the majority’s conclusion and the
supporting reasoning. The reasons for the dissent are set forth in his Partial Dissenting

Opinion.

The Tribunal will first summarise what it understands, on the basis of the submissions of
the parties and the EC’s request to intervene as a non-party, and the referenced documents,

to be the relevant rules of EU state aid law.

Article 107(1) of the TFEU provides that:

[A]ny aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in
any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort
competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of
certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member
States, be incompatible with the internal market.

There are certain exceptions to the prohibition in Article 107(1), none of them relevant

here.

50 Ibid, MH 14-16.
5 Ibid, 1 10.

125

409.

410.

411.

412.

Article 107(3) sets out criteria to be applied by the EC in approving state aid proposals. If
a proposal is not approved, it must be withdrawn or duly modified, an injunction

enforceable by the CJEU (Article 108(2)).

Article 108(1) requires the EC, in cooperation with member states, to ‘keep under constant

review all systems of aid existing in those States’. In accordance with Article 108(3):

The Commission shall be informed [...] of any plans to grant or alter

aid. If it considers that any such plan is not compatible with the

internal market having regard to Article 107, it shall without delay

initiate the procedure provided for in paragraph 2. The Member

State concerned shall not put its proposed measures into effect until

this procedure has resulted in a final decision.
According to these provisions, state aid which is not notified under Article 108(3), or which
is implemented before it is authorised by the EC, is unlawful. Unlawful aid can and in
principle should be recovered, as the EC can require its repayment by all recipients to the
granting state. But the failure to notify aid, though it makes the aid unlawful, does not entail
that the EC may not subsequently find the aid compatible with the internal market: this is
what happened with the Disputed Measures, which were notified by Spain only after their
implementation. In approving them in its decision of 10 November 2017, the EC confined
itself to ‘lamenting’ the late notification.>” It could have ordered the payment of interest

on amounts paid prior to the approval date but did not do so.

The question whether particular payments constitute aid under EU law is a matter for the
EC, national courts, and ultimately the CJEU. The onus lies primarily on the state, whose
obligation it is to notify its (planned) aid measures, but also the recipient can be expected
to ascertain whether the measures have been notified, which it can do by consulting the on-

458

line register of ai Moreover, it is well established that:

[S]o long as the Commission has not taken a decision approving aid,
and so long as the period for bringing an action against such a
decision has not expired, the recipient cannot be sure as to the

lawfulness of the proposed aid which alone is capable of giving rise
to a legitimate expectation on his part.*#

This principle is of long-standing. For example, in 1997, the Court held:

[I]n view of the mandatory nature of the supervision of State aid by
the Commission under Article 93 [now 108] of the Treaty,
undertakings to which an aid has been granted cannot, in principle,
entertain a legitimate expectation that the aid is lawful unless it has
been granted in compliance with the procedure laid down in that
article. A diligent operator should normally be able to determine
whether that procedure has been followed.*4>

In the EU state aid context, the relevance of legitimate expectations is that they can, in

certain limited circumstances, constitute a defence to a claim for repayment of aid.>*°

b. The application of state aid law to the Special Regime

The Claimant argues that neither Spain nor the EC initially considered Special Regime
subsidies to constitute state aid. Nevertheless, the two Directives on Renewable Energy of
2001 and 2009 both expressly refer to Articles 87-88 TFEU,**” and the EC, in
implementing these Directives, has approved a large number of subsidies schemes for

renewable energy. The matter was put by the EC in 2005 in the following terms:

As stated in indent 12 of the pre-amble of Directive 2001/77/EC, the
tules of the Treaty, and in particular Articles 87 and 88 thereof,
apply to public support. Such support is normally covered by the
Community Guidelines on State aid for Environmental Protection
and might be economically justified on a number of grounds as the
beneficial effects of such measures on the environment outweigh the
distorting effects on competition. Since the use of renewable energy
sources is a priority in the policy of the Community, the mentioned
guidelines are rather generous for such support schemes. On that
basis, some 60 State aid schemes supporting renewable energy

sources were approved by the Commission during the period 2001
to 2004.54

416. In fact, it does not appear that any green energy subsidy scheme was disapproved by the
EC during this period. The EC register of state aid lists only five negative decisions,
involving Austria (2011°4°), France (2016°°° and 2018°°!) and Germany (2015? and
2018°°3). None of these schemes bore any resemblance to the Spanish Special Regime in

force up to 2013.

417. Thus, it appears to have been the case that state aid rules were in principle applicable, but
that the EC took a ‘rather generous’ approach to their application,** consistent with the

Guidelines on Renewable Energy.

418. It may be pointed out that Spain itself notified certain proposed schemes to the EC under
Article 88. The first such notification seems to have been in 2003, well before

It’s not the only one that wasn’t notified at the time. But in total — I’ve counted —
there are 90 different applications for approval by different European countri
submitting renewable energy support schemes for approval by the Commi n,
and there have been 90 approvals granted. And some of those approvals occurred
in the same timeframe as RD 661/2007 was passed, and some of those approvals
included regimes that were offering higher returns than Spain offered, and
regimes that explicitly grandfathered existing plant from further reviews. So this
was just not an issue of concern at the time.

N 132/2003 was a notification by Spain in 2003 of a proposed state aid regime involving the regional government
of Navarra. The proposed scheme consisted in direct subsidies to cover up to 40% of the investment costs of renewable
energy facilities below 100 KW located in Navarra. The EC raised no objection to the scheme.

128

419.

421.

As to whether the Special Regime subsidies constitute state aid as defined, the Claimant
confined itself to arguing, without further elaboration or documentary support, that at the
time of the investment, both Parties and the EC assumed that they did not. Nevertheless,
the Guidelines of 2001 point in a contrary direction. Although the cost of the subsidies
was intended to be met by consumers, the Spanish state provided for them by law and was
closely involved in the operation of the system. In its decision of 10 November 2017, the
EC held that the Disputed Measures constituted state aid, and by parity of reasoning so did
the Special Regime. The CJEU’s decision in PreussenElektra, which is sometimes cited in
this context, seems plainly distinguishable. The Tribunal concludes that the Special
Regime constituted state aid as defined and should have been notified to the EC under

Article 108 of the TFEU.

The Claimant points out that the EC never condemned the Special Regime subsidies as
state aid, still less did it require their repayment by the large number of recipients of
subsidies.” The Respondent asserts that it follows from the EC’s 2017 decision on the
Disputed Measures that the Claimant can have had no legitimate expectation of receiving

subsidies in excess of those provided for by those Measures, or indeed at all.>°*

In its Decision of 10 November 2017, the EC held that payments made under the Disputed
Measures from their inception in 2014 until 10 November 2017 were state aid and, not
having been notified, were unlawful.>? After examination, it decided that the aid was
compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article 107(3)(c) of the TFEU. As for
existing facilities, ‘payments under the premium economic scheme are covered by the
decision in order to assess proportionality, i.e. the absence of overcompensation.”* But
it was ‘not relevant for the scope of this decision to assess whether the originally foreseen

payments under the previous schemes would have been compatible or not.’°°!

422. A separate question for the Tribunal is the relevance, if any, of the EC’s intimation or
decision that compliance with any damages award in the present case would by itself
constitute notifiable state aid, subject to the standstill obligation.» In this regard the

Tribunal agrees with the Vattenfall tribunal:

While the Tribunal is mindful of the duty to render an enforceable
decision and ultimately an enforceable award, the Tribunal is
equally conscious of its duty to perform its mandate granted under
the ECT [...] The enforceability of this decision is a separate matter
which does not impinge upon the Tribunal’s jurisdiction °°
423. Turning to the substantive question of the interaction of EU law with the ECT, the

following observations should be made:

(a) In principle, an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation of treatment which is
unlawful under the law of the host state, provided that the host state law itself is not
acting inconsistently with the treaty under which the tribunal exercises its
jurisdiction. In an international forum such as the present one, a host state may
not rely on its domestic law as a ground for non-fulfilment of its international
obligations.*® Investors, for their part, are under an obligation to conduct a due
diligence assessment prior to investment to acquaint themselves with the applicable

host state law and form their legitimate expectations accordingly.

(b) In the present case, the host state’s law itself (incorporating EU state aid rules) is
not inconsistent with the ECT, under which the tribunal exercises its jurisdiction.
Although arguably harsh on recipients as they risk bearing the harmful
consequences of the subsidizing state’s omission to notify the aid, the EU rules in
regard of non-notified aid are clear and have been consistently interpreted. From
the standpoint of international law, ‘municipal laws are merely facts which express

the will and constitute the activities of States, in the same manner as do legal

decisions or administrative measures.’* The Tribunal therefore does not interpret
EU law as such, but accepts the consistent interpretation of EU law as applied by

the relevant institutions.

The initial investments at issue in the present case were made in 1997, after a due diligence
process that had no regard to EU state aid law.°®’ As it is at least arguable that state aid
law should have been seen as relevant even at that time, the Tribunal finds this omission

surprising.

The EC, which has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing state aid law,
was well-informed as to the Spanish special subsidy regime in its various manifestations
under the 1997 Law. Indeed, it extolled the Special Regime as ‘the main driver for
investment in wind energy’ and as ‘rather well adjusted to generation cost’.** There is no
indication that it did anything to raise with Spain the state aid issue until the Disputed
Measures were belatedly raised by Spain itself in December 2014, well after the cessation

of Special Regime subsidies and the repeal of the 1997 Law.

Spain, an EU member since 1986, ought to have been aware of its notification duty under
Article 108(3) of the TFEU and should have acted accordingly. There is, however, no
causal link between the omission to notify and the fact that the Claimant has not continued
to receive the amount of subsidies provided for in RD 661/2007. The illegality of unnotified

Special Regime subsidies played no role in subsequent events, including the enactment of

the Disputed Measures, which were driven by purely domestic concerns, notably the tariff

deficit.

Despite its detailed knowledge of the Special Regime, the EC for its part has taken no steps
to enforce the relevant provisions of EU law against the recipients of subsidies generally.
Instead it has elected to try or threaten to block the payment of any award of ECT and BIT
tribunals, including this Tribunal, as constituting de novo a form of state aid. It will be for
the parties through subsequent proceedings to work through the consequences of the
Tribunal’s award under EU law and international law, including by reference to the
provisions of the ICSID Convention concerning the status and enforcement of awards.*°
The Tribunal can do nothing but decide the present case in accordance with the applicable

law.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds by majority that under EU law and the law of
Spain, the Claimant could not legitimately have expected that the Special Regime subsidies
were, for certain, lawful. Even if the subsidies were lawful, it could not expect, under EU
law and the law of Spain, that the amount of state aid granted under these measures would
be paid for the lifetime of the plants. The Claimant should have known that these measures

had not been notified to, let alone approved by, the EC.

However, the EC has equally not rendered a decision that the Special Regime subsidies
were unlawful. It merely stated, with full knowledge of the facts, that it was ‘not relevant’
whether the previous scheme was compatible with EU law. As such, the EC has not created
a right (still less a duty) for Spain to procure the reimbursement of amounts of state aid
already paid, including to the Claimant’s wind farms and other recipients. Nor, in the light
of the record, does the Tribunal believe that EU law required only the level of subsidy
provided by the Disputed Measures. The EC, which has quite broad discretion in such

matters, made no such finding.

The Tribunal has already held that no compensation is due to the Claimant for the non-
continuation after 2013 of the level of state aid under the Special Regime that was in force
before 2013. But the position with respect to claw-back of subsidies paid under the Special
Regime is not, in the Tribunal’s view, to be treated in the same way. Recipients of such
subsidies could not have had a legitimate expectation that they would be continued
unchanged. But the subsidies having been paid (and subject to any lawful recovery
measures by the EC, which did not occur), they remained entitled to the benefit of the stable

regime which Article 10(1), first and second sentences, of the ECT promised.

Indeed, the effect of the non-application in practice of the law as to unnotified state aid is
that continuing investors such as the Claimant are disadvantaged as compared to those who
benefited from the Special Regime subsidies but sold their investment prior to the
introduction of the Disputed Measures. In the absence of recovery of the unnotified aid
from all recipients (which has not happened), the latter group retain the benefit of the earlier

subsidies, as reflected in the sale price, without claw-back.

The Tribunal notes that in its decision of 10 November 2017 (C(2017) No. 7384), the EC
did not consider the Spanish Disputed Measures, including their claw-back effects, as a
violation of the principle of legal certainty and legitimate expectation. Basing itself on the
‘principle of interpretation in conformity’, the EC found that the ‘principle of fair and
equitable treatment cannot have a broader scope than the Union law notions of legal
certainty and legitimate expectations in the context of a State aid scheme’. However, the
focus of the EC decision was on the post-2013 situation, as evidenced by its decision ‘not
to raise objections to the aid [i.e. the Disputed Measures, leaving aside the previous regime]
on the grounds that it [was] compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article
107(3)(c) [of the] TFEU’. However, as this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to interpret
EU law itself but has to accept the consistent interpretation of EU law as applied by the
relevant institutions, so does the EC not have jurisdiction to impose a binding interpretation
of the meaning of legitimate expectations under the ECT (a treaty to which the EU has
acceded as a party thereby agreeing to submit itself to the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal,

should any dispute arise, and to comply with the resulting binding awards).

To this the Tribunal turns.

DAMAGES

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. The Claimant’s position

The Claimant argues that it is entitled to full reparation for the harm suffered because of
the Disputed Measures. It claims reparation for a reduction in the fair market value of its
shares in the SPCs, compound interest and a tax gross-up.*”° To assess the damage the
Tribunal must take into account the date the last of the Disputed Measures entered into
force.*”! In doing so, it must use a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.°”? This method
has often been applied in ECT disputes by international tribunals, especially to investments

with a proven track record.*”*

Under the full reparation standard, according to the Claimant, its damages consist of four
different parts. First, the damage consists of historical damages, running from the date the
first Disputed Measure entered into force until the date the last Disputed Measure entered
into force, i.e. 30 June 2014.5 Second, the Claimant claims lost value damages, which
consist of the difference between the value of its shares in a hypothetical but-for scenario
in which the Respondent would not have violated the ECT and the value of its shares on
30 June 2014. Third, the Claimant includes compound interest on the first two amounts
running from 30 June 2014. Fourth, the Claimant adds a tax-gross up, which takes into

account the hypothetical payment of taxes on the awarded damages.>”>

To calculate historical damages Brattle uses a model setting out what the SPCs’ financial
performance would have been between December 2012 and 30 June 2014 if Spain had not

adopted the Disputed Measures, but RD 661/2007 would have continued to apply.>”°

Second, the Claimant and its experts apply a DCF analysis to quantify the impact of the
Disputed Measures on the investment (lost value damages). To do so, Brattle compares
two scenarios. In the Actual Scenario, it projects the Claimant’s future cash flows to which
the Disputed Measures apply. In the second scenario, called the But-For Scenario, Brattle
assumes that Eurus has the right to receive payments under RD 661/2007.°”’ Hence, the
But-For Scenario applies the hypothesis that none of the Disputed Measures ever entered

into force.

Furthermore, the Claimant argues that the DCF method is the relevant method for the
quantification of its damages. Two facts render the method particularly appropriate for the
quantification of damages in ECT arbitrations. First, the investment has a long history of
profitability and second, several variables that affect the future profitability of the

investment can be applied in a reliable way.*”*

To calculate the lost value damages Brattle first determines the future cash flow of each
SPC as of the Valuation Date. The experts also take into account business forecasts and the
amount due to Eurus under RD 661/2007 as well as under the Disputed Measures. Finally,
various maintenance agreements assist the experts in gaining data on operating and

maintenance costs of the investor.5”

Second, Brattle takes the regulatory risk and the systematic risk into account, which
reduced its projection of the future cash flow. The formula that needs to be applied follows
the standard capital asset pricing model: Discount rate = Risk Free Rate + (Risk Adjustment

Factor x Market Risk Premium). The outcome of the analysis is a discount rate of 4.84%.°°°

Third, Brattle adjusts its analysis by deducting the value of each SPC’s outstanding debt

and the liquidity levels of Eurus’ interest in each SPC.**!

In the Rebuttal Quantum Report, Brattle updated the total amount of damages taking into
account new data.>*? Based on said report Eurus claims losses, exclusive of interest and tax

gross-up, of EUR 173 million.***

In addition, the Claimant argues that, if the Tribunal held that Claimant was entitled to no
more than a ‘reasonable return’ it would nonetheless be entitled to damages.*** This would
mean that Eurus would have been entitled to receive a 7% after-tax return — as under RD
661/2007 — over a 20-year ‘regulatory period’.** In this regard, Brattle proposed two

alternative figures of damages, either EUR 237 million or EUR 120 million.**°

Finally, the Claimant maintains that in order to comply with the standard of full reparation,
the award must include compound interest running from the date of the breach, i.e. when
Spain enacted the Disputed Measures.**’ Moreover, the Claimant points out that Spain did
not contest the inclusion of compound interest.*** The basis of claim is Article 13(1) of the
ECT, which allows for an interest to be applied at a ‘commercial rate established on a
market basis’. Based on Spain’s sovereign borrowing rate, based on a 10-year bond, Brattle
deems it appropriate to apply a rate of 1.16% compounded monthly. This is because
according to Brattle, the Claimant has become an ‘unwilling lender’ since Spain did not
pay the compensation promptly. This renders the sovereign borrowing rate an appropriate

reference. The claim for pre-award interest is EUR 12 million.**”

Finally, Eurus argues that it is to be awarded a tax gross-up of 28%, amounting to EUR 72

million. In Japan, Eurus would have to pay taxes on the compensation awarded. However,

this would leave the Claimant still out of pocket as compared with the situation where the
Respondent had not enacted the Disputed Measures. According to Section 2-1-43 of the
Japanese Corporate Tax Act, the applicable rate would amount to 27.8%, which needs to

be taken into account by the Tribunal.*”

In total, the Claimant’s compensation amounts to EUR 258 million including damages,

interest and the tax gross-up.>”!

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the Claimant has not suffered from any damage. Accordingly,
the result of the quantum analysis is that Claimant cannot claim any compensation
whatsoever. Further, Spain maintains its argument that Claimant’s quantification is wholly

592

speculative.°’” Moreover, the DCF analysis is not an adequate method to quantify the

Claimant’s damage, even assuming it had suffered damage.*”*

First, the Respondent criticises the calculation method chosen by Brattle. Spain puts
forward that none of the alleged damages has been proven, which renders the damages
speculative and hypothetical. Moreover, the Spanish Supreme Court has rendered more
than one hundred judgments rejecting the speculative quantification methods used by the
Claimant. According to the Supreme Court that method ‘lacks [the] necessary rigour and

certainty’.°4

Furthermore, Spain argues that the DCF method is inappropriate and the Tribunal should
adopt an asset-based method. This is because, according to doctrine, the following

circumstances render the DCF method inadmissible and impossible:

(a) The fact that it involves a capital-intensive business, with a significant asset base.
Practically all its costs arise from investing in tangible infrastructure. There are no

relevant intangible assets to analyse.

(b) The high dependency of the cash flows on external, volatile and unpredictable

elements, such as the price of the pool, inter alia.
(c) The long-term nature of the forecasts.

(d) The disproportion between the alleged investments (and the alleged assumed

risk).>

Taken together, these circumstances lead to the conclusion that the DCF method is
inapplicable. As a result, the Tribunal must apply an asset-based quantification method

taking into account the profitability and book value of the investment.>”°

Moreover, Spain argues that Claimant’s returns have been higher than ‘the reference rates’
used by Eurus and Brattle. Pursuant to BDO’s calculation, the Claimant’s average IRR
amounts to 13.43% before taxes, with a result of 15.15% before taxes for the shareholders.
Compared to the return before taxes under the Disputed Measures, which is at 7.398%,

there is no negative impact. As a result, Eurus is not entitled to any damages.*””

Nonetheless, BDO performs a subsidiary DCF analysis to show that there has not been any
negative impact on the Claimant’s investment. To compare the Actual Scenario with a But-
For Scenario, BDO applies similar criteria as Brattle. However, it uses lower revenues and
a shorter useful life of the plants, reduced to 20 years. As to the But-For Scenario, BDO
changes the parameters of the analysis, reaching a different result compared to Brattle’s
analysis. According to BDO’s DCF analysis, the impact of the disputed measures on

Claimant’s investment is ‘neutral or mildly positive for the Claimant’ .°

As to the determination of interest, the Respondent does not object to the application of
pre-award interest. However, Brattle calculates interest on the basis of a ten-year Spanish
bond, whereas BDO uses a short-term government debt interest rate. Using the ten-year
bond artificially inflates the risk and therefore the compensation, which is contrary to the
ILC Articles on State Responsibility and the principle laid out by the Court in the Chorzéw

case.*?

Finally, Spain maintains that the tax gross-up claim is inadmissible and unjustified. This is
for three reasons. First, Article 21 of the ECT contains a tax carve-out, preventing the
Claimant from asking for a compensation for any hypothetical taxes it will have to pay.
Furthermore, the tax cannot be attributed to the Respondent under the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility, as the tax is applied by a third state. As it is not an act of the Respondent,
it is not attributable to Spain. Second, the Claimant has not submitted any proof as to their
obligation to pay taxes on the award in Japan. In this regard, Spain also argues that Eurus
Japan’s alleged damages would flow-through its wholly-owned Dutch subsidiary, Eurus
Europe, which may have liabilities, like taxes, loans, etc. But Eurus Japan’s tax gross-up
claim fails to account for the corporate layer of Eurus Europe. Third, all this renders the
claim ‘speculative, contingent and uncertain’.*! As BDO points out, this conclusion is

supported by the fact that Brattle only dedicated three paragraphs to the tax gross-up.°”

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis
It follows from the Tribunal’s decisions on jurisdiction and liability that neither of the

primary claims of the Parties as to quantum can be accepted.

In terms of jurisdiction, the Claimant’s primary claim includes an amount on account of

TVPEE, which claim the Tribunal has held to be outside its jurisdiction.

In terms of substance, the Claimant’s experts value the claim on the basis that the Claimant
had a ‘legal entitlement to a specific schedule of tariffs’ reflected in RD 661/2007.°°

As put by the Claimant in closing:

That regime, Royal Decree 661, is our but-for, and it is our but-for

scenario however you might choose to parse out the various plants

that comprise the Claimant’s investment.
The Tribunal has however held, by majority, that the Claimant’s investments had no right
to subsidies at the level of RD 661/2007, and no legitimate expectation to such subsidies
either. Moreover, even if there had been such an expectation, the but-for situation would
not have been, as the Claimant argues, RD 661/2007, with or without modifications, but

something more indeterminate.

It is not, however, necessary to pursue these issues further. The Tribunal has held that the
breach of Article 10(1), first and second sentences, of the ECT is limited to the effects of
the ‘retroactive reduction in the allowed return’ (the ‘Claw-Back Feature of the Disputed
2), 605

Measures and the question is how to value that amount.

Like the RREEF tribunal, the present Tribunal has not been able, despite its best efforts, to
quantify the amount of this retroactive reduction on the basis of the reports and supporting
work papers filed by the Parties’ respective experts. It is, however, satisfied that the
Parties’ experts are qualified and have sufficient knowledge of the case and that the
different results obtained by both experts are a result of the different calculation methods
which they applied. Consequently, the Tribunal decides that the Parties, with the assistance
of their experts, shall seek to reach an agreement on the impact of the Claw-Back Feature
of the Disputed Measures alone, on the basis that those measures were otherwise consistent

with the ECT.

Tf the Parties cannot, within 3 months of the date of this Decision, reach agreement on the
amount payable in this respect, either Party may request the Tribunal to decide the
outstanding issues in dispute, in accordance with a prompt briefing schedule. If the Parties
do reach agreement on the amount due, they should report this to the Tribunal in order to
enable it to issue an Award incorporating this Decision and dealing with any residual issues

identified, including costs, thereby terminating the proceedings.

(3) The Tax Gross-up Claim

One matter of quantum that can be resolved at this stage is the tax gross-up claim.

The Claimant seeks compensation for the hypothetical payment of taxes in Japan so that it
can receive full reparation.’ The Respondent rejects the claim on the ground that it cannot

be held liable to pay for tax measures implemented by a third state.

In this context, it is significant that there appears to be no precedent for the award of a tax
gross-up involving taxation of a third state. In five recent cases, Eiser,® Masdar,6
Antin,®' OperaFund,*"' and BayWa,°" the tribunals rejected the gross-up claims for lack

of supporting evidence.

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that, on the material now available, there is
uncertainty as to the legal position on damages and taxation.°! It is unclear at what point
the damages awarded would have been taxed in the normal course and remitted in whole
or in part to the Claimant. Eurus also failed to submit a persuasive rebuttal of Spain’s
argument that Eurus Japan’s tax gross-up claim fails to account for the corporate layer of

Eurus Europe.

For these reasons the Tribunal rejects the claim for a tax gross-up.

CONCLUSIONS

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds, by majority:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)
(e)

that the ECT and the European state aid regime apply concurrently to the

investment and form part of the applicable law;

that the Claimant did not have a legitimate expectation that the Special Regime
subsidies, notably in terms of RD 661/2007, would continue to be paid for the
lifetime of its plants;

that the retro-active claw back by Spain, in and after 2013, of subsidies earlier paid
at levels in excess of the amounts that would have been payable under the Disputed
Measures, had they been in force in previous years, did breach the obligation of

stability under Article 10(1), first and second sentences, of the ECT;
that there was no other breach of the ECT;

that all other claims must be rejected.

The Parties shall seek to reach agreement on the impact of the claw-back feature of the

Disputed Measures, on the basis that those measures were otherwise consistent with the

ECT, taking in due account the reasoning and findings in the present Decision.

Tf the Parties do not, within 3 months of the date of this Decision, reach agreement on the

amount payable in this respect, either of them may request the Tribunal to decide the

outstanding issues in dispute, in accordance with a prompt briefing schedule. If the Parties

do reach agreement on the amount due, they should report this to the Tribunal in order to

enable it to issue an Award incorporating this Decision and dealing with any residual issues

identified, including costs, thereby terminating the proceedings.
