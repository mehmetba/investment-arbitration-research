Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) under the Rules Governing the Additional
Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of ICSID, as amended
effective April 10, 2006 (the “Additional Facility Rules”), on the basis of Chapter Ten of
the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement, (the “DR-
CAFTA”), which entered into force for the United States on March 1, 2016, and for the
Dominican Republic on March 1, 2007.

The Claimant is Corona Materials, LLC (“Corona” or “Claimant”), a limited liability
company incorporated under the laws the State of Florida of the United States. The
Respondent is the Dominican Republic (“Dominican Republic”, “DR” or the

“Respondent’).

The Claimant and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Parties.”

The present award (the “Award”) contains the Tribunal’s decision on the Respondent’s
Expedited Preliminary Objections in accordance with Article 10.20.5, DR-CAFTA, dated
December 3, 2015 (the “Preliminary Objections”). Through its Preliminary Objections the
Respondent requests the Tribunal, among other things, to declare that it lacks jurisdiction
to hear this dispute given that the Claimant’s claims allegedly fall outside the three-year

period stipulated by Article 10.18.1 of the DR-CAFTA.

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A. Request for Arbitration

5.

On June 10, 2014, ICSID received a request for arbitration from Corona Materials, LLC

against the Dominican Republic (the “Request” or “RFA”).

In its RFA, the Claimant submitted that the DR discriminated against Corona as a foreign
investor, and deprived Corona of the value of its mining project as a result of the following

1

Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections
measures: (i) the DR Secretary of the Environment’s passing Resolution 17-2008
cancelling the administrative procedure for obtaining permits to export aggregate, when to
Corona’s knowledge no other party was considering exporting construction aggregate out
of the DR at that time'; (ii) the DR Secretary of the Environment's passing Resolution 21-
2009, which unfairly and disproportionately imposed a discriminatory tax of $2.00 per
cubic meter on aggregate exports”; (iii) denying Corona the environmental approval for the
Joama Exploitation Concession when on August 18, 2010 the DR Environmental Ministry
ruled that Corona’s proposed project was “not environmentally feasible”?; and (iv) the
Ministry’s failing to reconsider the denial, when the Sub-Secretary of Environmental
Management had agreed to do so. According to the RFA, on October 5, 2010, Corona
submitted a letter requesting the Environmental Ministry to reconsider its conclusion that

the project was “not environmentally feasible”, but never received any written response.*

Corona further asserted in its RFA that the above measures allegedly breached the DR-
CAFTA Articles 10.3 (National Treatment); 10.5 (Minimum Standards of Treatment,
including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security); and 10.7.1

(Expropriation and Compensation)>.

Subsequently, in accordance with Article 4(1) of the Additional Facility Rules, on June 24,
2014, the Claimant submitted an Application for Access to the Additional Facility, and
expressly consented to the Centre’s jurisdiction over the dispute if the Convention enters

into force in the Dominican Republic at any point in the future.

Corona supplemented its RFA with letters dated June 24, 2014, July 14 and 29, 2014 in

response to questions posed by the Centre in the course of its review of the RFA.

On July 14, 2014, the Claimant confirmed that its claims against the Dominican Republic

were asserted in a timely manner in compliance with the condition set forth under DR-

' RFA, 1165-67.
2 RFA, 1 68-73.
3 RFA, 175-76.

Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections
CAFTA Article 10.18.1, which requires that “No claim may be submitted to arbitration
under this Section if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the
claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged
under Article 10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought under Article
10.16.1(a)) [...] has incurred loss or damage.” By letter of July 28, 2014, the Claimant
confirmed that in accordance with DR-CAFTA Article 10.18(2)(b)(i) it waived “any right
to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any
Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure

alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.”

On July 30, 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 4 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules and notified the Parties of the
registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General pursuant to Article 5(e)
of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an

Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Chapter III of those Rules.

Tribunal Constitution

In accordance with DR-CAFTA Article 10.19, unless the disputing parties agree otherwise,
the Tribunal shall comprise three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party, and a

presiding arbitrator appointed by agreement of the parties.

Pursuant to DR-CAFTA Articles 16.6 and 10.19, the Claimant appointed Mr. Fernando
Mantilla-Serrano, a national of Colombia, and the Respondent appointed Mr. J.
Christopher Thomas QC, a national of Canada, as arbitrators in this case. Both arbitrators

accepted their appointments.

By letter of September 7, 2015, the Claimant requested the Chairman of the Administrative
Council to appoint the President of the Tribunal, pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID
Convention, and Rule 4 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. In response to a request for
clarification from the Centre of September 8, 2015, by email of September 9, 2015, the

Claimant confirmed that its request of September 7, 2015 was made pursuant to DR-

Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections

CAFTA Article 10.19(3), according to which, “fiJf a tribunal has not been constituted
within 75 days from the date that a claim is submitted to arbitration under this Section, the
Secretary-General, on the request of a disputing party, shall appoint, in his or her

discretion, the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed.”

On October 6, 2015, the Secretary-General transmitted a list of potential candidates for a
presiding arbitrator to the Parties, and invited the Parties to consider them and provide their
views by October 16, 2015, by way of a ballot form. As a result, on October 16, 2015, the
Parties agreed on the appointment of Professor Pierre-Marie Dupuy, a French national, as

the presiding arbitrator.

On October 19, 2015, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Article 13(1) of the ICSID
Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had
accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been
constituted on that date. Ms. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, ICSID Legal

Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

The Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections in Accordance with DR-
CAFTA Article 10.20.5.
On December 3, 2015, the Respondent filed “Expedited Preliminary Objections in
Accordance with Article 10.20.5, DR-CAFTA” (the “PO Memorial’), together with

accompanying factual and legal exhibits.

First Session

The Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on December 9, 2015, by telephone
conference. The Parties confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly
appointed. It was agreed inter alia that the proceedings would be conducted in accordance
with the ICSID Additional Facility Rules in force as of April 10, 2006; and the DR-
CAFTA; that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish; and that the legal

seat of the proceeding would be Washington, D.C. A procedural timetable was fixed for

Al.

To the extent relevant for the purposes required by the Tribunal to address the
Respondent’s DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.5 Preliminary Objections, and for that limited
purpose only, the Tribunal summarises the factual background to the dispute. The
summary of facts does not reflect any finding of fact or conclusion of law by the Tribunal

in this Part of the Award.

The case concerns a mining project to build and operate a mine in the DR from which
Corona would export construction aggregate materials to Florida and elsewhere (the

“Project”).’

In May 2007, Corona through its 99% owned Dominican subsidiary, Walvis Investments,
S.A. (“Walvis”), submitted an application to the DR Mining Office to operate the Joama

Exploitation Concession (the “Exploitation Concession Application”).®

In September 2007, the Claimant submitted an application for an Environmental License
(the “Environmental License Application”), required to operate the aggregates mine, to
the Respondent’s Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (the “Environmental
Ministry”).”

The Claimant asserts that Joama Exploitation Concession was granted in 2009 for a

period of 75 years!®, and that the only remaining approval needed to make full use of it

was to obtain the Environmental License, for which an Environmental Impact Assessment

(the “EIA”) was required.!!

The Claimant submits that there were delays in processing Corona’s Environmental

License Application, !”

in issuing the amended terms of reference,'* and in issuing
Corona’s EIA.'* In the Respondent’s view, it was the Claimant that delayed the proceeding
by omitting or delaying its response to the Ministry’s requests for documents and
information, and by modifying the scope of the project several times during the assessment

process. !>

On August 18, 2010, the Environmental Ministry, through Communication No. DEA-
3867-10, informed Corona that the Joama Project was “not environmentally viable” (the
“Negative Environmental Decision” or the “Communication No. DEA-3867-10”).!° The
Negative Environmental Decision was taken by Resolution 737-10 of the Environmental
Ministry’s Technical Evaluation Committee (“TEC”) following a meeting of July 28, 2010
(“Resolution 737-10”).'’ According to the Claimant, the Negative Environmental Decision
failed to proffer actual reasons, was only two pages long, did not provide explanations, nor
set out any procedure by which the decision could be appealed or could be submitted to
reconsideration.'* The Claimant further submits that Resolution 737-10 was never served
on the Claimant.'? The Respondent, on the other hand, argues that the communication not
only informed Walvis of the Ministry’s decision to reject the license application, but also
of the reasons why such decision was made, as it indicated that the rejection was based on

Articles 118, 120, 126, 129, and 8 of Law No. 64-00 on the Environment and Natural

Resources. According to the Respondent, those articles from Law No. 64-00 refer to the
State’s power to limit resource use for public interest reasons.”? The Claimant argues that
Resolution 737-2010, submitted by the Respondent with its Reply (but not served to the
Claimant), if read jointly with Communication No. DEA-3867-10, establishes beyond
doubt that the Respondent’s refusal to grant Corona an Environmental Permit for the

Project was an arbitrary act.?!

According to the Respondent’s witness, Ms. Beriguette, in her role of Environmental
Assessment Director at the Environment Ministry at the time, she participated in the TEC
for the Joama Project, and in particular in the July 28, 2010 meeting, during which various
members of the committee offered technical reasons why the project should be rejected.
She further submits that after the meeting, the project representative and its consultants,
who were waiting outside of the room, as they could not be present during the deliberation,
were invited into the room, and were informed orally of the decision and the reasons for it.
This was followed by a written notification dated August 18, 2010.” To the contrary, the
Claimant’s witness, Mr. French, submits that none of Corona’s representatives or
consultants were invited to the TEC meeting on July 28, 2010. Mr. French further asserts
that between the July 28, 2010 meeting and the receipt of the Communication No. DEA-
3867-10 of August 18, 2010, he was informed by one of Corona’s environmental
consultants that TEC had approved the Environmental License Application, but that it was
not signed. Mr. French also submits that he had not seen Resolution 737-10 prior to

reading the Respondent’s Reply.”?

On October 5, 2010, the Claimant submitted a letter to the Environmental Ministry.

It is disputed whether the environmental assessment proceedings have been closed or not.
According to the Claimant, it has never been formally closed by the Respondent.
However, the Respondent asserts that Communication No. DEA-3867-10 expressly stated

The Claimant submits that at a meeting held in January 2011 (the “January 2011
Meeting”) between company representatives and the Sub-Secretary of Environmental
Management, Mr. Reyna, and other government officials regarding the Negative
Environmental Decision, the Claimant was told that the Decision would be reconsidered. A
further meeting was allegedly held in mid-June 2011 (the “June 2011 Meeting”), also
regarding the status of the Environmental License and the reconsideration of the Negative
Environmental Decision. The Claimant also refers to its various written communications to
Government officials,”® and claims to have been told on several occasions by DR officials,
among them, Ms. Beriguette of the Environmental Ministry, that the Negative
Environmental Decision was under reconsideration.” With regard to the June 2011
Meeting, Mr. Alain Stanley French, a principal of the Claimant, asserts that environmental
consultants, including Mario Mendez of Empaca, met with Secretary Jaime David of the
Environmental Ministry and Sub-Secretary Reyna in relation to the Environmental
License. Mr. French submits that based on what he was told he still believed that there was
a possibility that the Environmental Ministry may reconsider its Negative Environmental
Decision and issue an Environmental Decision for the Project.*° According to the

Vice-Minister Ernesto Reyna, and Corona’s consultant Mr. Mario Mendez never took
place. The Respondent submits that the Claimant has not provided any evidence that such a
meeting was held in June 2011, that the Claimant’s accounts of the June 2011 meeting are
inconsistent, and that this strongly suggests that the Claimant and/or its witness Mr. French
chose to refer to “an alleged (but non-existent) June 2011 meeting for the sole purpose of
avoiding the consequences of DR-CAFTA Article 18.10.1.”*! The Respondent further
rejects any allegation that the former Minister and Vice-Minister created expectations or
made promises that the rejection of the environmental license would be reconsidered and
annulled and/or that an environmental license could be granted.** The Respondent’s
submissions were supported with the witness statements of Ms. Lina Beriguette, Mr.
Emesto Reyna, Minister Jaime David Fernandez, and Ms. Rosa Abreu, who also indicated
in their respective statements that no individual official was legally empowered to annul

the Negative Environmental Decision.*?

On February 23, 2011, the Claimant wrote a letter to Vice-Minister Reyna** to complain
about the lack of progress [of the Motion for Reconsideration] (the “February 23, 2011
letter”).*> The Respondent submits that it is evident from the express language of the letter
that its real purpose was to warn the Dominican Republic of Corona’s intent to proceed to

arbitration under DR-CAFTA unless Corona’s demands were met.*°

Since the Parties have extensively debated the February 23, 2011 letter, the Arbitral

Tribunal considers important to transcribe said letter in its entirety:

Reference: ISSUANCE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERMIT FOR
THE JOAMAEXPLOITATION CONCESSION CODE 3378/3263:
WALVIS INVESTMENTS, S.A.

Distinguished Engineer,

This past Thursday, 17 February 2011, we visited the offices of
Environmental Management to determine the status of the
Reconsideration of the JOAMA Environmental License. Several people at
Management tried to assist us, but no one was able to provide any
information about JOAMA. Finally, after two hours speaking with five
people, we were informed that after the meeting with the delegates from
Sanchez in their office on January 2011, personal [1] from Environmental
Management had not worked or advanced on the reconsideration of the
application for JOAMA Environmental License. It is true we are very
disappointed but not surprised. For more than three years, the modus
operandi of Environmental Management seems to stay the same without
changes. During this time, we have been subjected to continuous delays,
excuses, unfulfilled promises, questionable competence and, in several
instances, rudeness.

We invested in the Dominican Republic for the following reasons. In 2006,
high ranking officials from President Ferndndez’s administration
convinced us that our investment of 80 million dollars in an export
company would be safe in Sanchez. Also, all the partners met with you and
the Minister of Environment, Minister Omar Ramirez, in your offices and
your personal expressed enthusiasm about JOAMA. On the basis of these
guarantees, we proceeded to invest in good faith in the JOAMA project at
World Level. Now, after our frustrating experience we have arrived at the
conclusion that Environmental Management, for unknown reasons, does
not want to or cannot process for JOAMA’s Environmental License
Application diligently and in good faith.

We recognize that the Dominican Government has correct and
appropriate means to allow or deny mining activities, and must do so
through administrative proceedings that are found in the environment in
Mining Law 146-00, and the Environmental Law 64-00, nothing in this
letter should be interpreted as a request for a special favor. However, the
Dominican Government is also a Party to the DR-CAFTA Treaty and is
required to respect its provisions.

The Partners of Corona in Florida believe that Environmental
Management may be unaware of the substantive obligations of Article 10

15

Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections

of the DR-CAFTA that protects foreign investors like us. According to
them, Environmental Management has seriously violated these protection
provisions on various occasions. One Corona partner is also a lead
partner in the prestigious international law firm Greenberg Traurig,
which are specialists in the area of investor-state disputes and have
successfully represented investors before arbitration tribunals as they did
in the first DR-CAFTA case. This Arbitration Process in Investor-
Dominican State disputes does not go before the Dominican courts but
rather before an arbitral tribunal in Washington, DC. Generally, the
Investor-State dispute tribunals are not indulgent to States and their
interpretation of “Fair and Equitable Treatment” is much broader than in
Dominican courts. The International Law Association (ILA) over the
Committee on Foreign Investment last interpretation of the “Fair and
Equitable Treatment” in Article 10 requires of very important obligations
for the guest (Dominican) State: now it is well established that the rule
requires certain level of rule of law within the host country which
encapsulates the obligation to act in a coherent manner, without
ambiguity and with total transparency, not arbitrary and in accordance
with the principle of good faith.

Also, the investors may expect due process in processing their claims and
that authorities’ actions are taken in a non-discriminatory manner and
proportionate to the political objectives involved. Among these features
the need to respect the objective of creating favorable conditions for the
investment, complying with legitimate commercial expectations of the
investors and without any drastic changes in the tax regime.

For your reference, some of the specific violations to DR-CAFTA
obligations are listed below:

I. The Minister has issued public statements in the press that
environmental licenses are processed in 30-60 days, while we have been
waiting more than thirty six months.

2. After having been granted the Terms of Reference of the Mine and
private Marine Port, the Minister signed Resolution No. 18 at the end of
2008, which effectively canceled the authorization procedure to export
construction aggregates.

3. Since we had already made a considerable investment and entered into
the future commitments required, the Terms of Reference were divided in
two: one Terms of Reference for the Quarry and another for the Marine
Port so that at least the licensing process for the Quarry could continue,
the original Terms of Reference were no longer valid. After a considerable
delay, the Ministry issued a new Term of Reference only for the Quarry
with a strict limitation that aggregate materials could not be exported.

16

Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections

4. After industry pressure, the Minister signed Resolution #21 at the
beginning of 2009 reinstating the authorization process to export
aggregates. Nevertheless, for reasons unknown to us . . . the Ministry
continued denying the Terms of Reference for the Private Marine Port and
continues not to permit the export construction aggregates
notwithstanding Resolution #21. We have noted that Resolution 21 does
not appear that they have distributed it within the Ministry and has not
been published in the Ministry’s website.

5. Resolution #21 includes a new tax of $2.00 per square meter on exports
for construction aggregates however the domestic tax was kept in $0.30
per square meter. We consider that this tax is arbitrary and unfair and in
violation of the obligations and spirit of the DR-CAFTA agreement.

6. The Ministry on repeated occasions has asked us for copies of the same
information related to issues that are obsolete and not relevant anymore.
For example, they have asked three times for copies of the “No Objection
Letters” of the plot owners indicating that they allow us to have
exploration activities on their land. The exploration phase was completed
30 months ago and the “No Objection Letters” have been replaced with
sales and leasing contracts. We can only conclude that the technical staff
that is working on the request does not completely understand the project
or Environmental Management is deliberately blocking our request.

 

7. On November of 2010, the Ministry sent a notice that the project was
“not environmentally viable,” citing six extracts of environmental
provisions... none of which we were in violation. For example, it declared
that the project required a 30 meter buffer from all bodies of water when
we are at a distance of 700 or more meters. In conclusion, the letter does
not include a specific reason to deny the license.

8. The Minister can has recently declared that he is not going to any new
mining operating license.

9. The Mining Director and the Minister of Foreign Relations of the
Investment office (CEIRD) promoted the DR to us in Florida in 2005 and
2006 and, based on their guarantees in which we have invested in the
good DR faith and now Corona’s partners believe that we could have been
cheated and could have been defrauded by the Dominican State.

In accordance with the instructions of the Partner of Corona, I have
contacted the Dominican CEI-RD offices and the International Commerce
Direction (DICOEX) to try to negotiate an amicable solution. To this
meeting scheduled for 2 March 2011 at 9:30, the Director of DICOEX, a
representative of CEI-RD and the Mining Director, Corona has invited a
representative of the Commercial Representation of the US and the

17

Executive Director of ASIEX (Dominican Foreign Investors Association)
to participate.

According to the administrators of Corona, express if the Environmental
License and the Terms of Reference for the Private Port are not issued the
damages to Corona arising directly from the violations of Management
would be USD 342 million. However, we can accept lesser losses and
injuries and damages for the three years that JOAMA is paralyzed we can
reach a settlement on 2 March 2011 during the meeting at DICOEX,
subject to Corona receiving the Environmental License and the Terms of
Reference for the Private Marine Port and the Conveyor Belt.

We sincerely hope that you or your colleagues also can participate in this
meeting so that we have the opportunity to avoid an Arbitral Tribunal in
Washington, DC...

Sincerely,

Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections

“The Dominican Republic hereby respectfully requests this Tribunal that:

a. This Preliminary Objection be deemed to have been submitted in due time and in
proper form in accordance with Article 10.20.5 of the DR-CAFTA; Substantive
proceedings be suspended;

b. The processing of this Objection be expedited in accordance with Article 10.20.5 of

53. The Claimant ratified the above request for relief in its PO Rejoinder.*°

Vv. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS

A. The Respondent’s Memorial on Preliminary Objections

54. In its PO Memorial, the Respondent claims that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the
Claimant’s claims because the alleged acts and omissions on which the Claimant’s claims
are allegedly based took place outside the three-year period required under DR-CAFTA

Article 10.18.1 for a Tribunal to have jurisdiction over the claims.*!

(1) Legal Framework and Legal Standard

55. According to the Respondent, the legal framework that applies to preliminary objections

can be found in Paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.47

56. The Respondent submits that the legal standard applicable to DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.5

is the one adopted by the Renco v. Peru® tribunal, which after analysing Article 10.20.5 of

the United States-Peru FTA (analogous to DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.5)*, asserted (i) that
the expedited procedure comprises both objections of law under paragraph 4 as well and

any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal’s competence;*>

and (ii) that
claimant’s factual allegations relating to tribunal jurisdictional issues under Article 10.20.5,
unlike Article 10.20.4, are not required to be “assumed to be true” for the filing of

preliminary objections.

(2) Claims Lie Outside of the DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 Three-Year Period

The Respondent submits that in accordance with the two elements comprised in DR-
CAFTA Article 10.18.1, a tribunal would lack jurisdiction ratione temporis if the claim
brought under DR-CAFTA Article 10.16 is not submitted to arbitration within three years
following the date on which the claimant (a) acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge
of the alleged breach; and (b) acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge of the loss or

damage incurred.*°

In analyzing the elements of the statute of limitations set out in DR-CAFTA Article

10.18.1, the Respondent notes that certain steps need to be followed.

First, the Tribunal should define the relevant measure(s) that allegedly gives rise to the

alleged breach*”.

Second, the Tribunal should determine the relevant critical date in order to determine the
end of the three-year limitation period. The Respondent submits that tribunals have

uniformly taken the date of receipt by the Secretary-General of ICSID of the Request for

 

3 The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru, UNCT-13-1, Decision as to the Scope of the Respondent's

Arbitration from which the three-year period is calculated backwards**. The Respondent
initially asserted that in the present case, the date of the RFA, as supplemented, is July 28,
2014, and that consequently, July 28, 2014 would be the date prior to which the Claimant
must have acquired knowledge of the alleged breaches, and of the alleged resulting
damage*’. However, during the Hearing, the Respondent agreed to take June 10, 2014 (i.e.
date of receipt of the RFA by ICSID) as the effective date of the RFA and, therefore, June
10, 2011 as the critical date for DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1, after deducting the DR-

CAFTA three-year limitation period.*°

Relying on the interpretation given by several North American Free Trade Agreement
(“NAFTA”) tribunals to a provision included in Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) of NAFTA,
which is similar to DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1, the Respondent asserts that the three-year
period set out in Article 10.18.1 does not permit suspensions, extensions or other
modifications,”! and that it is not necessary for the claimant to know the exact amount of

loss or damage in order for time to begin to run.**

The Respondent includes a table with a compilation of (1) the Claimant’s claims; (2) the
measures which, according to the Claimant, constitute the breaches on which the
Claimant’s claims are based; (3) each of the dates of the measures invoked; and (4) the

time period that elapsed from the date of the measure to the date of the RFA.*

According to the Respondent, the Claimant acquired knowledge of the existence of the
measures on each of the dates when the measures were passed, or alternatively on dates

very close to such dates and, in each case, on dates prior to June 10, 2011.

As for the loss or damage claimed to have been suffered, the Respondent submits that in
the Claimant’s Notice of Intent*‘, reference was made to a letter of February 16, 2011 to
Mr. Emesto Reyna Alcantara, Deputy Minister of Environmental Management at the
Environmental Ministry, which evidences that the Claimant “had clearly acquired
knowledge of the damages supposedly caused by the alleged breaches of the DR-CAFTA”,
3 years, 5 months and 6 days before the RFA.*°

The Respondent then analyses the Claimant’s claims for alleged breaches of DR-CAFTA
Articles 10.3 (National Treatment), 10.5 (Minimum Standard of Treatment), 10.7
(Expropriation), under the perspective of its objection under DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1,
and concludes that they were all submitted outside of the three-year relevant time limit, and

must therefore be dismissed.

a. The Dominican Republic has not consented to arbitration to settle the
claim made by Corona regarding the alleged breach of Article 10.3 (National
Treatment) of the DR-CAFTA

The Respondent notes that Corona invokes the Environmental Ministry Resolution No. 17-
2008 dated November 18, 2008 (“Resolution No. 17-2008”), and Resolution No. 21-2009
dated May 25, 2009 (“Resolution No. 21-2009”), as measures that allegedly breached DR-
CAFTA Article 10.3 by being discriminatory, designed to unfairly and disproportionately
tax any party, seeking to export aggregate outside the Dominican Republic, in particular

Corona.*”

According to the Respondent, the Claimant acquired, or should have acquired knowledge

of Resolution 17-2008, and of Resolution No. 21-009, on the date of the respective

SPO Memorial, 932.

55 The Respondent understands that this letter might in fact be one dated February 23, 2011 from Mr. A.

adoption of these measures, over five years before the RFA, thus the claim based on those

measures is outside the relevant three-year period.**

The Respondent also refers to Communication No. DEA-386710, issued by the
Environmental Ministry on August 18, 2010, which notified Walvis that the Joama
Exploitation Concession project had been declared environmental unfeasible.*? The
Claimant argues that this Communication, which rejected the request for an environmental
license, breached DR-CAFTA Article 10.3 by allegedly applying environmental
regulations to Corona differently than that applied to domestically owned mining

operations.

The Respondent claims that the Claimant acquired knowledge of this measure on August
18, 2010, 3 years, 11 months and 11 days before the RFA, and that consequently, the claim

based on this measure was submitted outside the relevant three-year period.°!

Further, the Respondent, referring to decisions rendered under the NAFTA, submits that
given that the DR-CAFTA does not allow a suspension or interruption to the limitation
period established in Article 10.18.1, it is irrelevant whether Corona submitted any appeal

for reconsideration or not.

With regard to the alleged damages caused by the above-indicated measures, namely: (i)
the termination of the possibility of Corona pursuing its mining project (Resolution No. 17-
2008); (ii) imposing a tax of US$2.00 per cubic meter on aggregate exports, which was
alleged to have a severe impact on Corona’s future profit margins (Resolution No. 21-
2009); and (iii) the denial of the request, the Respondent submits that the Claimant also

acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge of the alleged damages caused by the above-

indicated measures, on the same dates as each of such measures were adopted. That is,

over three years prior to filing the RFA.

Furthermore, the Respondent submits that such knowledge is evidenced by the February
23, 2011 letter from Mr. A. French, Corona’s representative, to the Deputy Minister of
Environmental Management, where the company estimated the amount of damages it had
sustained as a consequence of the measures just listed, which allegedly resulted in the

violation of DR-CAFTA Article 10.3, at some US$342 million.”

b. The Dominican Republic did not Consent to Arbitration to Submitting
the Claim Concerning the Alleged Violation of Article 10.5 (Minimum Standard
of Treatment) of the DR-CAFTA.

The Respondent refers to the measures which, according to the Claimant, allegedly
violated DR-CAFTA Article 10.5. by (i) displaying arbitrary and discriminatory conduct,
unfairly targeting Corona’s investment, or to Corona’s detriment as a foreign investor;
(ii) by violating the fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security owed to
Corona; (iii) by discriminating against Corona as an investor, denying it the right to due
process as part of the environmental licensing procedure, and not granting the minimum

standards of due process in the reconsideration process.°

First, with regard to Resolution No. 17-2008 (subsequently revoked) and Resolution No.
21-2009, already identified supra, the Respondent submits that the Claimant was, or should
have been aware of both resolutions on the dates on which they were issued (over five

years before the RFA).

Second, with regard to the administrative procedure regarding the environmental license

application, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has not elaborated or provided data to

support its allegations of violations of the right to due process.

The Respondent asserts that the relevant administrative procedure ended with the denial of
the license application, which according to the Claimant’s Notice of Intent, was
communicated to the Claimant on August 18, 2010.% As a result, the Claimant would have
been aware of the alleged violations of due process during the environmental license

application procedure prior to August 18, 2010.

Third, regarding the denial of the environmental license, the Respondent submits that as
stated in its preceding arguments supra, the Claimant was aware of such denial (3 years, 11
months and 11 days prior to the submission of the RFA).°*

Fourth, with reference to the absence of any response to the “Request for
Reconsideration”, the Claimant claims that its application for reconsideration was
submitted on October 5, 2011.°? The Respondent argues that it was untimely, because in
the Dominican Republic, administrative actions become final and unchallengeable thirty
(30) days after their notification.”” Corona would have had up till September 17, 2010 to
request a reconsideration of the denial decision, but submitted it only on October 5, 2010,

license became final on September 17, 2010 (3 years, 10 months and 12 days prior to the

Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections
The Respondent notes that ‘negative administrative silence’ is a legal principle according

to which an administrative authority shall be deemed to have denied an application when a

specific statutory period has expired without its having responded to the application.

The Respondent submits that Corona cannot therefore assert that it did not receive a
response to its application of October 5, 2010. Once two months had elapsed without a
response from the Ministry, the Claimant should have concluded that its request for

reconsideration had de facto been denied by operation of negative administrative silence.’

In the event that it is still argued that this silence constitutes a violation of the Minimum
Standard of Treatment under DR-CAFTA, the Respondent submits that the date to be
considered for the purposes of DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1, would be December 5, 2010,
when the Ministry’s decision was deemed confirmed by operation of the negative
administrative silence. Arguably, that date could be extended to January 5, 2011, up to
when the Claimant could have resorted to the administrative courts. Even that date would

fall outside of the relevant three-year time limit.”

The Respondent then refers to the Claimant’s claim of alleged violations of the DR-
CAFTA by the Dominican Republic’s absence of a response to Corona’s communication
of February 16, 2011” to the Sub-Secretary of Environmental Management, whereby the
Claimant allegedly requested, inter alia, an environmental license to commence operations
in the Joama Exploitation Concession” (the alleged “New License Application”). The
Respondent rejects the contention that this letter was a license application; rather, it was a
threat with the initiation of arbitration proceedings to seek compensation for damages
estimated to be US$342 million, unless the environmental license and the terms of
reference for the private seaport and the conveyor belt were issued, and submits that such

letter did not require a response.’° Nevertheless, the Respondent argues that in the event

that this Tribunal determines that a response was required, in the absence of a written

response, by virtue of the negative administrative silence doctrine, the adduced application

is deemed to have been denied once two months had elapsed from its filing.””

According to the Respondent, the Claimant was or should have been aware of any violation
or damage caused by virtue of negative administrative silence concerning the alleged “New
License Application” not later than March 23, 2011 (or April 23, 2011, if considering the
date of expiration of the Claimant’s right to resort to the administrative courts following
the authority’s silence and of the implicit refusal arising therefrom). Either of these dates

would still be prior to the July 28, 2011 critical date.”®

The Respondent submits that in the event that the Claimant attempts to argue that this
“License Application”, and the alleged lack of response interrupt or suspend the
prescription period set forth under DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1, it should be recalled that
(i) DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 does not provide for any suspension of the relevant three-
year period; and (ii) that in accordance with the general principles of law applied by
international courts, a suspension of this nature only applies in cases of force majeure or
when a right-holder is fraudulently prevented from bringing proceedings. ’? According to
the Respondent, this is not the case here, and the prescription period under DR-CAFTA

Article 10.18.1 cannot be deemed to have been suspended or interrupted.

The Respondent also disputes the Claimant’s submissions concerning the alleged January
2011 and June 2010 Meetings with officials of the Environmental Ministry following the
denial of the environmental license application, as no evidence has been provided as to
whether they took place or what was allegedly discussed in them. The Respondent also

points to some inconsistencies in the RFA.

In its letter of July 14, 2014, in response to ICSID’s request for a confirmation of whether

the condition set forth under DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 had been met, the Claimant

confirmed that the claims were filed in time, as this was done during the three years from

the mid-June 2011 Meeting during which the Dominican Republic promised to reconsider

the application for the issue of a license.

The Respondent rejects the contention that any alleged promise made in any such alleged
meeting would suspend the prescription term. Relying on Feldman v. Mexico, the
Respondent submits that for conduct to interrupt or suspend the prescription periods, it
must have been prolonged, uniform, consistent and effective and must originate from an
administrative authority competent to acknowledge the viability of a claim against the
State and its amount. The holding of meetings with representatives of the Dominican
Republic cannot be considered as a continuing act resulting from the denial of
environmental permit or as a suspension of the prescription. Finally, according to the
Respondent, Corona had access to and could have appealed the environmental permit

denial before the Dominican Republic’s administrative or judicial authorities, but did not.°°

As for the loss or damage, the Respondent, relying on its previous arguments above,
submits that Corona was or should have been aware of the loss or damage it would sustain
as a result of the measures it cites as violating DR-CAFTA Article 10.5, at least as of
February 23, 2011°!. Such measures all occurred over three years prior to the submission

of the RFA.*

c. The Dominican Republic did not Consent to Arbitration by Submitting
the Claim Concerning the Alleged Violation of Article 10.7 (Expropriation) of
the DR-CAFTA.

The Respondent argues that the facts cited by Corona as grounds for the alleged violations

of DR-CAFTA Article 10.7, namely (i) the denial of the environmental license application;

and (ii) the absence of any response to the “request for reconsideration”, all took place

prior to July 28, 2011, and therefore, outside of the three-year prescription period.**

According to the Claimant, the alleged expropriation is a direct consequence of the denial
of the environmental license application. The Respondent submits that the Claimant
became aware of such denial, when it was issued on August 18, 2010, over three years

prior to the filing of the RFA.**

As to the alleged “Motion for Reconsideration”, the Respondent, once again submits that it
was untimely, without effect, and that by virtue of negative administrative silence, no

claim can be made of an absence of response.*>

The Respondent reverts to its previous arguments with respect to the Claimant’s contention
that the Dominican Republic’s inaction with respect to the alleged pledge to reconsider its

application suspended any prescription period that was applicable.*°

According to the Respondent, the Claimant was, or should have been, aware of the alleged
damages caused by the alleged expropriation, more than three years prior to the filing of
the RFA. At least on February 23, 2011, when Mr. A. French, in his letter on behalf of
Corona to Mr. Reyna Alcantara, estimated that the denial of the license had caused Corona

damages of US$342 million.*”

preliminary objections proceeding. As a result, they should be dismissed as falling outside

the scope ratione materiae of eligible objections for determination under the DR-CAFTA

Article 10.20.5 Expedited Procedure. **

The Claimant submits that its “Motion for Reconsideration” of October 5, 2010, of the
denial of the environmental license, which is equivalent to an appeal, is still pending and
has not yet been decided, and in the Claimant’s view, this is a denial of administrative

justice on the grounds of excessive delay.*

The Claimant submits that it was only in the second half of 2011, when the Claimant lost
hope that the Negative Environmental Decision would be reconsidered. The Claimant

notes that the RFA was filed 3 years from that date.*”

The Claimant gives a general overview of the facts, noting that although the Exploitation
Concession was granted in 2009, the Respondent has refused to grant the Environmental
License and/or explain how the Project should be modified for the Claimant to benefit
from its asset. In the Claimant’s view, this constitutes a continuing violation of the Fair
and Equitable Treatment standard (“FET Standard”), equivalent in effect to a de facto

expropriation. °!

According to the Claimant, the Respondent’s Preliminary Objections did not dispute the
facts alleged in the Claimant’s RFA, in particular the meetings held in 2011 and 2012 with
the DR authorities concerning the Motion for Reconsideration of the Claimant’s

Environmental License Application.”

The Claimant referred to Corona’s corporate registration on November 7, 2005, as a
limited liability company under the laws of the U.S. State of Florida, and summarised the

commercial business experience of its principal members: Messrs. Randolph Fields, John

Elliott and Alain Stanley French. The Claimant submitted witness statements from Mr.

Fields and Mr. French with its PO Counter-Memorial.”°

Regarding the Joama Concession, the Claimant referred to its early search in 2005 for
potential options to obtain aggregates from mines in the Caribbean to supply the Florida
market, noting that it carried out its operations in the DR through Walvis Investments, S.A.
(“Walvis”), its DR-incorporated subsidiary. In 2006, Walvis purchased three existing
applications for Exploration Concessions at the DR sites of Perla, Joben and Joama. The
Claimant asserts that after considering its key advantages, and encouragement from senior
officials from the DR government, it decided to start with the Joama Concession, and
commissioned a series of feasibility studies, including an environmental feasibility study
conducted by Empaca in February 2007, which concluded that the Project was “viable
environmentally”.°*

The Joama Exploitation Concession was granted to Walvis on June 1, 2009, conferring,
among others, the rights (i) to conduct mining activities within the perimeters of the
Concession; (ii) to extract mineral substances of mining sites for economic gain; (iii) to
exploit and benefit from the mineral substances extracted within the perimeters of the
concession for up to 75 years; and (iv) to construct and establish various types of

infrastructure in connection with the mining operations.°

However, the Claimant notes that the use of the Concession was subject to the positive

evaluation of the EIA, and the obtainment of the Environmental License or Permit.”

The Claimant thus sought to obtain the Concession and requisite Environmental License.
Reference is made, in particular, to (i) Corona’s Application for an Exploitation
Concession to Mine Aggregates and a Corresponding Environmental License; (ii) the
delays in approving the Exploitation Concession Application; (iii) the delays in processing
Corona’s Application for an Environmental License; (iv) the delays in issuing the

Assessment Study; (vi) the denial by the DR of the Environmental Approval for the Joama

environmental decision.”

(2) Environmental Impact Assessment Process

After providing an overview of generally accepted international principles of modern
environmental law, and of the international law commitments assumed directly by the
Respondent under DR-CAFTA, the Claimant concludes that a modern EIA process
imposes enhanced obligations upon states with respect to transparency, access to justice
and due process**. The Claimant submits that the conduct of the EIA process carried out
by the Respondent with respect to the Project was inconsistent with such principles and

international law, and protracted from the outset.°”

According to the Claimant, the Respondent failed to achieve a balance of three
fundamental rights (i) the Respondent’s sovereign right to form its environmental and
economic policies; (ii) the Claimant’s rights (prevailingly economic in nature) under DR-
CAFTA; and (iii) the right of the public (including Corona and Walvis) to receive reliable,
transparent information concerning the environment and decisions concerning the conduct
of EIAs in the DR.’ In late July 2010, the Respondent took a secret decision to
discontinue the EIA of the Project on murky grounds. Corona submits that the decision,
(allegedly in TEC Resolution 737-10) as described in the letter of August 18, 2010, was
arbitrary, and did not follow due process. It was never published nor served on the
Claimant, who only became notified of the decision by way of a two-page letter of August

18, 2010, which according to the Claimant did not provide specific reasons for the

discontinuance of the environmental assessment, nor any information concerning the legal

remedies available to it.!°!

The Claimant asserts that the Dominican authorities had several meetings and exchanges
with the Claimant which led it to believe that the Motion for Reconsideration of October 5,

2010 was being processed. !°

a. Violation of DR-CAFTA Article 10.5

DR-CAFTA Article 10.5.1 states:

“Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance

with customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment

and full protection and security.”
Pursuant to DR-CAFTA Article 10.5.2, the treatment accorded to covered investments is
the customary international law minimum standard. The Claimant notes that in accordance
with the FET standard, the Host State is obliged, among other things, not to deny
administrative justice. The Claimant submits that in its conduct of the EIA process with
respect to the Project, the Respondent committed numerous breaches of the FET Standard
as defined in DR-CAFTA Article 10.5, as it failed to conform to the international law
requirements of transparency and due process, with the result that it committed a denial of

administrative justice. !°

According to the Claimant, the Negative Environmental Decision, taken by Resolution
737-10, in a session of the Environmental Ministry’s TEC of July 28, 2010, without the
participation of the Claimant, deprived the Claimant’s right to be heard, had an
expropriatory effect on the Exploitation Concession, did not comply with the due process
requirements prescribed under DR-CAFTA Article 10.7, and was never served on the
Claimant, who only received a two-page notification letter with inadequate reasons. The

Respondent claims that the Motion for Reconsideration was practically the only legal

remedy available to Corona at that time, and the failure to rule on it implied a denial of

administrative justice.

Relying on the writings of international law scholars, the Claimant submits that the
minimum standard of treatment has developed as an independent standard that affords
foreigners certain procedural guarantees, such as due process and transparency, that must
be respected by the Host State, regardless of the treatment it affords to its own nationals,

and regards the denial of justice as a breach of international law.!°

The Claimant submits that as held by numerous arbitral tribunals (i.e., Bayindir v.
Pakistan, Lemire v. Ukraine, and Metalclad v. Mexico), and concluded in Redfern and
Hunter on International Arbitration, “the failure to ensure due process, consistency, and
transparency in the functioning of public authorities, and the lack of a predictable and
stable framework for investment [...] are breaches of fair and equitable treatment

standards”.'° [Bolding in original.]

According to the Claimant, by having a deficient system of administrative law, and thus
failing to guarantee due process, the Respondent is in breach of the FET Standard, and thus
of its treaty obligations under DR-CAFTA. Further, the Claimant relying on the
approaches from the tribunals taken by tribunals in Azinian v. Mexico and Hochtief v.
Argentina, submits that the excessively lengthy proceedings that the Claimant faced in
relation to the Motion for Reconsideration of the Environmental License was ruinous, and

amounted to a denial of justice by the Respondent’s administration. !°°

Finally, relying on various transnational sources of laws and standards, the Claimant
asserts that the international law requirements with respect to the conduct of EIA

proceedings are higher than in other cases.!°”

b. Violation of DR-CAFTA Article 10.7

DR-CAFTA Article 10.7 provides:

“[N]o Party may expropriate or nationalize a covered investment either
directly or indirectly through measures equivalent to expropriation or

nationalization.”

According to the Claimant, the Respondent’s violations of the FET standard also equates to

de facto expropriation of the Claimant’s investment.

The Claimant states that according to a number of arbitral tribunals, to find de facto
expropriation, a requirement of substantial deprivation has to be met. This has been defined
by the tribunal in Telenor v. Hungary as a substantial interference with the investor’s rights
that deprives the investor of the economic value, use and enjoyment of its investment.
Further, and as indicated by the tribunal in Tecmed v. Mexico, the government’s intention

or the form of the deprivation is less important than the actual effects of the measures. !°°

c. Continuing Nature of the Breach

The Claimant, relying on Article 14(2) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility for

110

Internationally Wrongful Acts’'’, submits that the Respondent’s actions form a continuous

violation of the DR-CAFTA protection standards. As a result, in the Claimant’s view, the
three-year limitation period provided for under DR-CAFTA Article 10.18 was renewed,

and the Claimant’s claims are not time-barred. !"!

Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections
Such was the case in the UPS v Canada, submits the Claimant, where the tribunal held
that “continuing courses of conduct constitute continuing breaches of legal obligations and
renew the limitation period accordingly.” |!”
The Claimant also submits that the Tribunal should consider whether there is any legal

recourse available under domestic laws against the relevant measures.!!?

(3) The Respondent’s Jurisdictional Objection is Without Merit

The Claimant notes that the Respondent’s Preliminary Objections are limited to the
contention that the Claimant’s claims are time-barred pursuant to DR-CAFTA Article

10.18.1.1!4

The Claimant submits that, from the clear language of DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1, to
calculate the three-year period stipulated therein: (i) the relevant date is the date of the
breach (not of the measure); (ii) the dies a quo is the date of the knowledge or presumed
knowledge (not the date of the breach); and (iii) the dies ad quem is the date of the initial
effecting of service of the RFA on ICSID.!!°

According to the Claimant, in the present case, the breach is the Respondent’s continuing
failure to react to the Motion for Reconsideration, and the cumulative impact of many

months without a decision amounts to denial of justice.!!°

Regarding the relevance of the requisite knowledge, the Claimant recalls that according to
the Respondent two requirements have to be met to trigger the three-year time limit: (i) the

actual knowledge of the breach by the investor, and (ii) the knowledge of loss or damage

   

resulting from the breach. The Claimant submits that the major difficulty in the present

case is that the international wrong committed by the Respondent consists of an arbitrary

omission. As a result, it is only based on the subsequent, external manifestations of that
decision that the Claimant could have realized that the wrong had been committed.
Between 2010 and 2012, the Claimant received mixed signals from the Respondent that led

it to believe that the Negative Environmental Decision would be re-considered.!!7

As a result, the Claimant submits that the Respondent should be estopped from arguing that

the Claimant should have had knowledge of the denial of justice before June 2011.!!8

According to the Claimant, the critical date for determining the relevant three-year period
is June 10, 2014, when the Claimant’s RFA was submitted, and not when the RFA was

supplemented, as the Respondent contends.
In this respect, the Claimant recalls that pursuant to DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.4(b)

“A claim shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section when
the claimant’s notice of or request for arbitration (“notice of
arbitration”): referred to in Article 2 of Schedule C of the ICSID
Additional Facility Rules is received by the Secretary-General.”

Further, the Claimant notes that the tribunal in Feldman v Mexico, when analyzing whether

the investor’s claims in that case were time-barred, confirmed that:

“the time at which the notice of arbitration has been received by the
Secretary General rather than the time of delivery of the notice of intent to
submit a claim to arbitration is apt to interrupt the running of limitation
period under NAFTA Article 117(2).”''

According to the Claimant, the Respondent’s Preliminary Objections are ill-founded and
should therefore be dismissed on the facts of the case, since the RFA was filed within three
years from the date when Corona first acquired knowledge of the denial of justice by the

Respondent. 2°

Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections
The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s arguments based on the doctrine of negative
administrative silence, claiming that this would allow the Respondent to benefit from its
own wrongdoing. Further, the Claimant argues that the Respondent should be estopped
from arguing that the Claimant ought to have submitted its claim earlier, given that the
Respondent’s officials induced the Claimant to believe that they were going to respond to

the Reconsideration Request.

At the time when the Motion for Reconsideration was submitted, the Dominican
Republic’s administrative procedural laws were not codified. This happened only in 2013,
when the DR Parliament enacted the general administrative law which entered into force in
2015 as Law 107-13. !?!

The Claimant also notes that under DR Law, following the entry into force of Law 13-07,
an administrative act could be challenged in parallel by both a motion for reconsideration

wae . 2
and a judicial action.!”

The two bases of challenge were subject to different sets of rules.
A judicial challenge had to be brought within 30 days, whereas a motion for
reconsideration did not. As a result, the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s argument

to the contrary is without merit.!7°

According to the Claimant, its Motion for Reconsideration was directed against the
Negative Environmental Decision, and not against the letter of August 18, 2010. As a
result, even if the 30-day rule applied to the Motion for Reconsideration, which the
Claimant refutes, the time period could not start to run from August 18, 2010, because the

Negative Environmental Decision was never served upon the Claimant.!7*4

The Claimant submits that the doctrine of negative administrative silence on which
Respondent relies cannot be applied to the Claimant, for the following reasons: (i) The
purpose of that doctrine in DR law “is to guarantee due process as by this rule, subjects of
administrative actions do not need to wait indefinitely for a response from the

(ii) it always acts in favor of the individual;!?° (iii) it would
deprive the Claimant of such an effective remedy before the DR-CAFTA Tribunal; (iv) it
would be unreasonable to assume that the environmental administration would be able to
complete the review of the application within such a short period of time; and (v) the
application of that doctrine to the EIA process in such a way as alleged by the Respondent,
would result in the Motion for Reconsideration of the negative decision not being an
effective remedy, which would be equivalent to a breach of the Respondent’s international
law obligations, including under DR-CAFTA, the violation of the FET Standard, and a
breach of Articles 68 and 69 of the DR Constitution. !7”

The Claimant once again challenges the Respondent’s contention that the Claimant could
have brought an international claim for denial of justice against DR after December 5,
2010; reaffirms its position that no party should benefit from its own wrongs, and asserts
that the Respondent is estopped from arguing that the Claimant should have submitted the

claim earlier. '!7*

Finally, the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s objection is ill-suited for the expedited
procedure; that the three-year period under DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 should be
calculated from the moment when the Claimant should have realized the inertia on the part
of the DR administration had transformed into a breach of DR-CAFTA; and that the

Preliminary Objections should be joined with the merits of the case.!??

The Respondent’s Reply on Preliminary Objections

The Respondent reaffirms that its preliminary objection is suited for resolution in the

present expedited procedure, for the following reasons.

(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections
First, Article 10.20.5 DR-CAFTA allows for the determination of issues of fact in the
course of the Expedited Procedure.'*° Relying in Pac Rim v. El Salvador, the Respondent
submits that a tribunal must view with a discerning eye claimant’s characterization of
events “as facts”.'*! As in Trans-Global v. Jordan, a tribunal “need not accept at face
value any factual allegation which the tribunal regards as (manifestly) incredible,
frivolous, vexatious or inaccurate or made in bad faith; not need a tribunal accept a legal

submission dressed up as a factual allegation.” >"

Second, the Respondent, relying on an article from Professor Jan Paulsson, quoted by the
Renco vy. Peru tribunal, asserts that from a plain textual interpretation of DR-CAFTA
Article 10.20.4, the Tribunal is also empowered to decide the merits of the case in this
procedure. '** Although, the Respondent notes, the Tribunal has not been asked to decide

the merits of the case within this Expedited Procedure. !*4

Respondent submits that the Claimant’s substantive arguments on the DR’s preliminary
objection are unsustainable. The Dominican Republic has demonstrated that the Claimant’s
claims are time-barred by virtue of DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1, because the Claimant was
aware, more than three years before the RFA’s registration, of the refusal of the license by
the Dominican authorities, and of its implications. In the Respondent’s view, this was
evidenced, in particular, by the Claimant’s letter of February 23, 2011 to the
Environmental Ministry.'*°

According to the Respondent, in an attempt to overcome the three-year limitation, the
Claimant divided the application process in two parts in its Counter-Memorial: (i) the

review and express rejection of the Claimant’s environmental application, which lies

outside that limit, and, as indicated by the Claimant itself, is to be treated as background
information; and (ii) the absence of a response by Dominican authorities to the “Motion for
Reconsideration”, which the Claimant submits is a free-standing measure that falls within

the three-year limit.

In the Respondent’s view, such a division is wholly arbitrary and self-serving. According
to the Respondent, the absence of a response to the Motion for Reconsideration is not a
stand-alone “measure” capable of creating jurisdiction. This, because (i) the claims
regarding the absence of a response to the “Motion for Reconsideration” are no different
from the claims concerning the Environmental License Application process generally; (ii)
the absence of a response to the “Motion for Reconsideration” is not an “omission” capable
of giving rise to a stand-alone claim under DR-CAFTA; and (iii) the “continuing violation”
doctrine does not exempt the Claimant’s claims from the time bar imposed by DR-CAFTA

Article 10.18.1.'%°

Furthermore, the Respondent argues that even assuming arguendo that the absence of a
response to the “Motion for Reconsideration” qualified as a stand-alone “measure”, the
Claimant has failed to articulate a prima facie claim for denial of justice in connection with

such measure. !37

In light of the above, the Respondent concludes that (i) the Claimant failed to submit its
claims to arbitration within the deadline contemplated by DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1, and
they should therefore be dismissed; (ii) the Claimant’s claim with respect to the alleged
failure to issue a ruling on the Motion for Reconsideration is neither different nor separate
from its challenge to other parts of the application review process; (iii) it is manifest from
the Claimant’s February 23, 2011 letter that the Claimant was aware at that time of the
alleged breach of DR-CAFTA, as well as of the corresponding damages; (iv) the Claimant
deliberately delayed the filing of the RFA until June 10, 2014, because in Respondent’s
view, the Claimant was trying to obtain external financing, which it did not obtain until
November 19, 2015. The Respondent characterizes such a delay for lack of funding as

negligent, and submits that the Claimant has also acted in bad faith by altering the

formulation of its relevant claims for the sole purpose of trying to fit such claims within the

limitations period established by Article 10.18.1.!°8

The Claimant’s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections

By way of introduction, the Claimant recalls that Resolution 737-2010, which had not been
served upon the Claimant, was submitted by the Respondent together with its Reply. The
Claimant submits that if read together with Communication No. DEA-3867-10, the
Resolution establishes beyond doubt that the Respondent’s refusal to grant Corona an

Environmental Permit for the Project was an arbitrary act.'°?

The Claimant asserts that the original international wrong, consisting of the Respondent’s
arbitrary act taken in July 2010 in breach of due process, subsequently evolved into an
international wrong of a different genre, i.e., a denial of justice, which did not come into
existence until after July 2011. Thus, this cause of action falls within the three-year period

leading up to the date of submission of the RFA on June 10, 2014.'#°

The Claimant submits that at the time of its February 23, 2011 letter, the Claimant still
expected that, by way of the Motion for Reconsideration, the Negative Environmental
Decision might be reversed, and reaffirms its position that the Respondent’s Preliminary

Objections are ill-suited for determination under DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.5.!4!

In its Rejoinder, the Claimant reaffirms that the case concerns a clear violation of DR-
CAFTA by the Respondent comprising: (i) the Refusal of the Environmental License, and
(ii) the Refusal to Entertain the Motion for Reconsideration as a separate breach of the DR-

CAFTA'?,

(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections

With regard to the Refusal of the Environmental License, the Claimant quotes the

relevant paragraph of Resolution 737-2010, that reads as follows:

“5. Exploitation Concession JOAMA (Code 3263)

Dismissed, the Province Director stated that the community is not in
agreement with the installation of the project because of a dispute between
the project-owner and the owners of real properties and that the entry into
the project has not been clearly defined; Lic. German Dominici asserted
that the project would affect coastal waters, Ing. Apolinar Suero noted
that there is lack of information concerning the structure of the project
and that it would have a negative impact on the community.”

The Claimant submits that Resolution 737-2010 contains an arbitrary decision falling
manifestly short of the minimum standard of treatment required under DR-CAFTA Article
10.5.1. Resolution 737-2010 further violates domestic principles, in particular those under
the DR regulatory framework of Environmental Licenses, Reglamento del Sistema de
Permisos y Licencias Ambientales (Regulation of the System of Environmental Licenses
and Permits) dated June 2004 ( the “June 2004 Regulations”)'**+. As shown in the Expert
Report of Fabiola Medina Garnes, the flaws of Resolution 737-2010 — most specifically the

ti45

lack of reasoning and the lack of competence of the body issuing it’ — are of such nature

that the Negative Environmental Decision in Resolution 737-2010 should be declared null

and void.'46

The Claimant then addresses the Refusal to Entertain the Motion for Reconsideration.
The Claimant notes that a distinction should be drawn between the original international
wrong resulting from the arbitrariness of the Negative Environmental Decision of July
2010, and the subsequent and distinct international wrong resulting from the Respondent’s

failure to redress that original wrong through its own system of domestic remedies. This, in

1 (R.8),

Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections

the Claimant’s view, is pivotal to the outcome of the Respondent’s Preliminary

Objections. '*7

The first, the Negative Environmental Decision, was an arbitrary act, in violation of due
process, and a breach of the minimum standard of treatment under DR-CAFTA Article
10.5.1.148

According to the Claimant, faced with the Negative Environmental Decision, and after
evaluating the recourses that were available locally and internationally, the Claimant opted
for filing the Motion for Reconsideration of the Negative Environmental Decision with the
Environmental Ministry. This was done as it was determined to move forward with the
Project,'*? and also out of concern that an international tribunal might not find the
Respondent liable in an eventual investor-state dispute settlement scenario, if the Claimant

did not exhaust local remedies in the host state.!°°

The Claimant submits that the Respondent has prevented the Claimant from challenging
the initial arbitrary act (the Negative Environmental Decision), by (i) failing to serve
Resolution 737-2010 containing the Negative Environmental Decision upon the Claimant;

and (ii) failing to respond to the Motion for Reconsideration. !*!

According to the Claimant, the Respondent’s failure to respond on the Motion for
Reconsideration violates Article 22.4 of the Dominican Constitution!®? and amounts to a
breach of the state’s obligations under DR-CAFTA to afford the Claimant “an adequate
opportunity, within a reasonable time, to vindicate their legitimate rights” (emphasis

added). !>3

Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections
In the Claimant’s view, the delay was caused solely by the Respondent’s reluctance or
refusal to respond to the Motion for Reconsideration. As a result, the Claimant submits that
the Respondent has violated DR-CAFTA Article 10.5.1 by violating the Claimant’s right to
be heard within a reasonable time, and that such a breach produces effects tantamount to an

expropriation of the Claimant’s investment in the DR.'**

The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s Preliminary Objections are without merit,
because they: (i) are misdirected, in that the Respondent fail to observe the distinction
between the breach of DR-CAFTA resulting from the Negative Environmental Decision of
July 2010 on the one hand, and the breach of DR-CAFTA resulting from the failure to
address the Motion for Reconsideration from October 2010 to the present date; (ii) are
based on a misreading of DR-CAFTA and misinterpretation of the Claimant’s February 23,
2011 letter; (iii) are based on arguments rooted in non-existent or misinterpreted rules of
DR law; (iv) are based on unreliable witness testimony; and (v) do not take into account

important principles of international law, such as estoppel and the nemo capere rule.!°

The Claimant asserts that its pleadings regarding the Respondent’s Preliminary Objections
are chiefly directed against the Respondent’s failure to respond appropriately to the Motion
for Reconsideration, which amounts to a denial of justice. For the purposes of DR-CAFTA
Article 10.18.1, this internationally wrongful act took place at some point between August

2011 and the present date.'>°

With regard to the February 23, 2011 letter, the Claimant submits that the purpose of the
letter was to attract attention, and to strengthen the negotiating position of the investor by
highlighting the undesirable alternative in order to obtain a decision. The Respondent’s
reliance on that letter is inapposite and insufficient to found its Preliminary Objection

because (i) the letter could not possibly refer to a breach of DR-CAFTA that did not exist

at the date of the letter; and (ii) the fact that the letter does not refer to the Respondent’s

failure to deal with the Motion for Reconsideration as a breach of DR-CAFTA.'57

According to the Claimant, as part of its attempt to mischaracterize the Claimant’s claim,
the Respondent conflates the notion of the “breach” referred to in DR-CAFTA Article
10.18.1 with the concept of a “measure”. After explaining the difference between these two
concepts, the Claimant submits that if neither Party argues that a denial of justice existed in
February 2011, it is not possible to assert that a non-existent breach of DR-CAFTA

resulted in quantifiable losses. '!**

In the Claimant’s view, the Respondent mischaracterizes the denial of justice as an
individual act. In this regard, the Claimant argues that (i) DR-CAFTA recognizes the
doctrine of continuous acts (a fact not contested by the Respondent), confirmed in the Pac
Rim case;'*? and (ii) as recognized by the UPS v. Canada tribunal, it is a general rule that

continuing breaches may renew the limitation period for claims under international law.!°°

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s allegations that the Claimant has in some manner
manipulated the facts to present its claim as falling within the time-limit requirement under

DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1.'¢!

According to the Claimant, the Preliminary Objections are based on incorrect arguments of

DR Law, for the reasons that follow.

First, the Claimant submits that the suspensive condition of receiving a positive result of
the EIA to which the Exploitation Concession was subject, means that until the condition is
fulfilled, the legal effect in question does not arise. As a result, in the Claimant’s view,

under the terms of the Exploitation Concession, until the Claimant receives a positive EIA

and the Environmental License is granted, its Exploitation Concession remains

suspended. '®

Second, the Claimant, relying on the expert reports of its two legal experts, refutes the
Respondent’s argument that Resolution 737-2010 is a working paper, and that the Negative
Environmental Decision dismissing Claimant’s Environmental License Application was

Communication No. DEA-3867-10.!3

Third, the Claimant also refutes the Respondent’s argument that DR law prescribes a time
limit for the submission of the Motion for Reconsideration of 30 days from the date of
service of the impugned administrative act (i.e., by September 17, 2010). The Claimant
submits that there was no such 30-day time limit for the submission of the Motion for
Reconsideration, and that in any event no such time limit could have started to run against
the Claimant, since Resolution 737-2010, the proper administrative act disposing of the
Environmental License Application, was never duly served by the Respondent upon the
Claimant. According to the Claimant, the Respondent had the burden to prove its argument

that the Motion for Reconsideration was extemporaneous, and failed to do so. 164

Fourth, the Claimant rejects the alleged lack of duty on the part of the Respondent to
respond to the Motion for Reconsideration. As shown by the Medina Legal Expert Report,
under the Dominican Constitution and the Inter-American Convention of Human Rights,
the DR administration has a general obligation to respond to all petitions received by the

concerned parties, and to do so within a reasonable time. 165

Fifth, with regard to the alleged applicability and effects of the Doctrine of Negative
Administrative Silence, the Claimant submits that if such doctrine did apply to the Motion
for Reconsideration, it entitled the Claimant to challenge the Respondent’s inaction before

the DR courts, but would not relieve the Environmental Ministry from its obligation to

respond within a reasonable time. The Claimant argues that the Respondent’s failure to

provide a response for the last five and a half years, absent any known mitigating

circumstances, constitutes a denial of justice under DR Law and under DR-CAFTA. 166

The Claimant argues that if the Tribunal accedes to the Respondent’s request to look
behind the facts set out by the Claimant, then the Respondent’s jurisdictional challenge is
unsuitable for determination within the Expedited Procedure, since highly relevant
documents are missing from the record because the document production process has not
yet taken place. The Claimant submits that the central procedural issue here is the degree to
which an arbitral tribunal sitting under DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.5 should make its own
determinations of the relevant facts and issues of domestic law, and what procedural
guarantees of due process it should afford in that respect to the Parties. In the Claimant’s
view, this should be approached in a methodical and abstract manner, as a pure exercise in

the interpretation of the treaty.'°7

According to the Claimant, the Tribunal should dismiss the Preliminary Objections,
without prejudice at this stage of the Arbitration, on the grounds of a reasonable
interpretation of DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.5, leading to the conclusion that the legal and
factual questions involved are too complex to be decided within such a compressed time
period. Such dismissal, in the Claimant’s view, should be without prejudice to the
Tribunal’s right to re-examine the issue at a later stage of the proceedings, based on the full

examination of the relevant facts and evidence. !°

Alternatively, the Claimant suggests the Tribunal to proceed with the Preliminary

Objections on the basis of pro tem assumption that the facts as stated by the Claimant are

correct, and dismiss the Respondent's Preliminary Objections for lack of merit.

VI.SUBMISSION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PURSUANT TO DR-
CAFTA ARTICLE 10.20.2
172. On March 11, 2016, the United States of America (“U.S.”) made its submission on
questions of interpretation of the DR-CAFTA, pursuant to Article 10.20.2. In its
submission the U.S. addressed the three issues relating to questions of interpretation of the
DR-CAFTA: (i) the limitations period under Article 10.18.1; (ii) the waiver requirement
under Article 10.18.2(b); and, (iii) the Minimum Standard of Treatment under Article 10.5.

173. On the issue of the limitations period, the U.S. interpretation of DR-CAFTA Article

10.18.1 is as follows:

(i) Article 10.18.1 refers to knowledge of the alleged breach and loss first acquired as
of a particular “date”, not at multiple points in time or on a recurring basis. As a
result, a continuing course of conduct cannot renew the limitations period under

Article 10.18.1;

(ii) where a “series of similar and related actions by a respondent state is at issue, an
investor cannot evade the limitations period by basing its claim on “the most recent
transgression of that series”. Accordingly, once a claimant first acquires (or should
have acquired) knowledge of the breach and loss, subsequent transgressions by the
State Party arising from a continuing course of conduct, as opposed to a legally

distinct injury, do not renew the limitations period under Article 10.18.1;

(iii)the interpretation from the UPS v Canada tribunal, regarding the renewal of claims
limitation period by continuing courses of conduct constituting continuing

breaches, is misplaced;

177.

Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)

(iv)the specific requirements of Article 10.20.1 operates as a lex specialis;

(v) the knowledge of loss or damage incurred need not be of the full or precise extent

of loss or damage; and

(vi) claimant bears the burden of proof, and must prove the necessary and relevant fact

to establish that its claims fall within the three-year limitation period. '7!

On the issue of the waiver requirement, according to the U.S. a claim cannot be submitted
unless and until it is accompanied by a waiver that complies with Article 10.18.2(b). Thus,
a Notice of Arbitration that is unaccompanied by a valid waiver does not constitute a claim
pursuant to the provisions of Chapter Ten. Further, in the event that a valid waiver is filed
subsequent to a Notice of Arbitration, the claim will be considered to have been submitted

on the date of the waiver. !””

Finally, on the issue of the Minimum Standard of Treatment, the U.S. submits that: (i) the
applicable standard in DR-CAFTA Article 10.5 of fair and equitable treatment is the
customary international law minimum standard of treatment (the “MST”); (ii) the MST
includes the notion of denial of justice; (iii) to breach the standard, the denial of justice
must arise from a final decision of a State’s highest judicial authority (unless an appeal
would be futile or manifestly ineffective) that is “notoriously unjust” or “egregious”

“which offends a sense of judicial propriety”. !77

By email of March 18, 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Dominican
Republic had no comments on the Submission, reserving its right to discuss the

Submission during the Hearing.

On the same date, the Claimant submitted its observations on the three aspects raised in the

U.S. Submission.

Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections

First, with respect to the limitation period under Article 10.18.1, the Claimant submits that
the arguments advanced by the U.S. are internally contradictory, irrelevant to the factual
matrix in the present case, and unfounded under principles of treaty interpretation. The
Claimant submits (i) that in the present case the Respondent’s failure to respond to the
Motion for Reconsideration gives raise to legally distinct injury (a denial of justice) to the
original wrongful act (the arbitrary refusal of the Environmental License), even though
both breaches are to a certain degree related to each other; (ii) its disagreement with the
U.S. interpretation that DR-CAFTA should be considered as a /ex specialis with respect to
admissibility rationae temporis of claims for continued violations of an international
obligation; and (iii) its continued reliance on the UPS tribunal’s interpretation that
“continuing courses of conduct constitute continuing breaches of legal obligations and
renew the limitation period accordingly.” !*

Second, regarding the waiver requirement under Article 10.18.2(b), according to the
Claimant, the U.S. submission in such regard manifestly exceeds the scope ratione
materiae of the Preliminary Objections, and disregards the fact that the waiver was
submitted in the present case. The Claimant also notes that Corona has not resorted to other
domestic or international remedies with respect to the matters at stake in this arbitration,
and that the Motion for Reconsideration was submitted by the Claimant’s wholly-owned

subsidiary, Walvis, which has a separate legal personality under DR law.!”°

Third, with regard to the third aspect of the Minimum Standard of Treatment under Article
10.5.1, the Claimant agrees with the U.S. general description that a denial of justice would
be considered a breach of DR-CAFTA Article 10.5.1, but takes a different position on the
following: (i) a denial of justice can also be committed by the administrative branch under
international law!”°; (ii) the exhaustion of local remedies requirement is a matter of

substance and not of jurisdiction/admissibility under investment treaty law; and, (iii) the

VII. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

A. The Relevant DR-CAFTA Provisions

181. DR-CAFTA Article 10.20, Conduct of the Arbitration, provides at subparagraph 4:

“Without prejudice to a tribunal’s authority to address other objections as a
preliminary question, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary
question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim
submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be
made under Article 10.26. [...].”

182. DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.5 states that:

“In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal
is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection
under paragraph 4 and any objection that the dispute is not within the
tribunal’s competence. The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the
merits and issue a decision or award on the objection(s), stating the grounds
therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request. However, if a
disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30
days to issue the decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is
requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing
its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30
days.”

183. DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.6 provides:

“When it decides a respondent’s objection under paragraph 4 or 5, the
tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party
reasonable costs and attorney’s fees incurred in submitting or opposing the
objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal
shall consider whether either the claimant’s claim or the respondent’s
objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable
opportunity to comment.”

Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections

DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.01 provides:

“No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than
three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired,
or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article
10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought under Article
10.16.1(a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article10.16.1(b)) has
incurred loss or damage.”

The Applicable Law

The Respondent’s Preliminary Objections filed according to Article 10.20.5 of the DR-
CAFTA are to be considered on the basis of the pertinent provisions of this very
Agreement. Article 10.22, Governing Law, sets out the governing law for a claim of this
type; the Tribunal “shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement
and applicable rules of international law”. This means that the law to be applied by the
Tribunal is public international law, constituted primarily by the specific source provided
by the DR-CAFTA as /ex specialis, but also interpreted and completed as the case may be

by general international law (i.e. customary international law)!78.

In their respective written pleadings as well as during the Hearing, both Parties have
introduced a considerable amount of legal analysis of the DR’s municipal law. It is then all
the more important for the Tribunal to state that, as far as the examination of a Preliminary
Objection filed under the DR-CAFTA is concerned, the municipal law of the Respondent,
as such, cannot be considered as part of the law applicable to the examination of these

objections.

As the case may be, municipal law might provide some pertinent elements of consideration
to the Tribunal, but the instruments, rules and provisions of this non-international law are
no more than mere facts in the context of the current proceeding which may inform the
Tribunal in its application of the governing international law. Such is the case, even if the
elements provided by this municipal law can be characterized as “/egal’” facts, in the sense

that they may have some legal significance for the application of the pertinent rules of

Law of Treaties at Articles 31 and 32.

 

54

Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections
public international law. As it will be seen later in this Award, whatever the importance
devoted to DR municipal law by the Parties, and in particular by the Claimant, both in its
written pleadings and during the Hearing as well as in its Post-Hearing Brief, the DR’s
Law plays nothing but a marginal or subsidiary role, including when the Tribunal
addresses the issue of an alleged denial of justice committed by the Respondent against the

Claimant.

C. The Basis for Consent to Arbitration

188.

189.

190.

The DR-CAFTA’s “Investor-State Dispute Settlement” section (Section B) contains the
consent of each DR-CAFTA Party to this form of arbitration. Article 10.17, “Consent of

Each Party to Arbitration’, provides in relevant part:

“I. Each Party consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration under this
Section in accordance with this Agreement [...].” [Emphasis added.]
Consent is thus expressly conditioned on the claimant’s submission of the claim in
accordance with the terms of the Agreement. In this respect, the invocation of the investor-

State arbitration clause is governed by a /ex specialis.

The precise contours of the State Party’s consent are addressed in the next article, Article
10.18, “Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party”, which among other things

contains a limitation period stating that:

“7. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than

three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimants first acquired,

or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article

10.1 6.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought under Article

10.16.1(a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b) has

incurred loss or damage.”
Article 10.18 sets out two other conditions and limitations, specifically the requirements:
(i) that no claim may be submitted to arbitration unless the claimant consents in writing to
arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in the Agreement; and that (ii) the
notice of arbitration must be accompanied by a written waiver from the claimant and/or its

enterprise, as the case may be. The claimant must waive “the right to initiate or continue

Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections

before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute

settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a

breach referred to in Article 10.16.”!”

Having regard to the ordinary meaning of the terms, read in their context and in light of the
Agreement’s object and purpose, the DR-CAFTA Parties have plainly conditioned their
consents to arbitration. If a claimant does not comply with the conditions and limitations

established in Article 10.18, its claim cannot be submitted to arbitration.

The present proceeding concerns the Claimant’s compliance, or not, with the three-year
limitation period prescribed by Article 10.18.1. The limitation period clause is written in
plain terms and does not contemplate the suspension or “tolling” of the three-year period.
In this regard, it is consistent with the approach taken in other treaties such as the North

American Free Trade Agreement. The relevant subparagraphs of Articles 1116 and 1117 of

180 !8!

that Agreement are worded similarly” and, as pointed out by the Respondent and by

the intervenor, the United States of America'’?, NAFTA tribunals have described
NAFTA’s limitation period as “clear and rigid” and not subject to any “suspension,

prolongation, or other qualification.”

Article 10.18.1 contemplates two forms of knowledge of breach and loss or damage,
namely, actual knowledge (viz. “No claim may be submitted to arbitration...if more than

three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired... knowledge

This waiver requirement is not absolute; subparagraph 3 permits a claimant to initiate or continue an
action that seeks “interim injunctive relief and does not involve the payment of monetary damages before a
judicial or administrative tribunal of the respondent, provided that the action is brought for the sole purpose
of preserving the claimant's or the enterprise's rights and interests during the pendency of the arbitration.”
Accordingly, it is possible for a DR-CAFTA claimant to commence an international claim for damages
whilst pursuing non-monetary injunctive relief before the respondent Party’s tribunals.

80 Article 1116(2) provides: “An investor may not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed from
the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach
and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.” Article 1117(2) is worded similarly.

'81 “The three-year period set out in Article 10.18.1 does not permit suspensions, extensions or other
modifications, as several arbitration tribunals have confirmed. Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) of NAFTA, for
example, include a provision similar to Article 10.18.1, which also sets out a time period for investors to file
their claims. NAFTA tribunals have interpreted that the period of limitations is “clear and fixed” and that “it
is not subject to suspension, extension or other modifications”. Respondent’ s Memorial on Objections, { 28.

of the breach... and knowledge that the claimant... has incurred loss or damage”) and
constructive knowledge (viz. “No claim may be submitted to arbitration ...if more than
three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant...should have first
acquired... knowledge of the breach... and knowledge that the claimant... has incurred

loss or damage”). [Emphasis added.]

It warrants emphasising that knowledge of the breach in and of itself is insufficient to
trigger the limitation period’s running; subparagraph 1 requires knowledge of breach and
knowledge of loss or damage. That said, in order for the limitation period to begin to run, it
is not necessary that a claimant be in a position to fully particularize its legal claims (in that
they can be subsequently elaborated with more specificity '**); nor must the amount of loss
or damage suffered be precisely determined. It is enough, as the Mondev tribunal found
when applying NAFTA’s limitation clause, that a “claimant may know that it has suffered
loss or damage even if the extent or quantification of the loss or damage is still

unclear...” "84

Applying Article 10.18.1 to the facts of the present case, in the Tribunal’s view, it is
logical to proceed by first considering any evidence of the Claimant’s actual knowledge;
only if such an inquiry does not establish such knowledge is it necessary to then engage in
an objective determination of whether in light of all the circumstances it can be held that
the Claimant should have first acquired knowledge of breach and loss or damage at a

particular point in time.

D. The Tribunal’s Approach

196.

The Tribunal shall thus proceed in two steps: First, it shall determine the earliest possible

date on which the Claimant would be permitted to have acquired actual or constructive

'83 As discussed below at paragraphs 210 er seq., the Tribunal notes that one of Claimant's contentions is that

it could not be aware of the denial of justice prior to June 11, 2011 because it did not manifest itself until
“after July 2011” (PO Rejoinder, { 5). As discussed below, the Tribunal considers that this attempt to
differentiate between the initial license denial and the closure of the file on August 18, 2010, on the one hand,
and the alleged denial of justice resulting from the failure to respond to the Motion for Reconsideration, on
the other, is unavailing. Thus, for the Tribunal, the limitation period began to run as of August 18, 2010.

Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections
knowledge of the alleged breach of the Treaty and of the incurred loss or damage for the
Claimant’s claims to have been submitted within the time limit for the purpose of Article
10.18.1. That date has been referred to by the Parties as the “critical date”. Once the critical
date has been established, the Tribunal shall, in a second step, verify whether or not, on

that very date, the Claimant already had, or should have had such knowledge.

(1) Determination of the critical date

DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 sets a time limit for the submission of claims to arbitration
which starts to run on the day that the Claimant acquires or should have acquired

knowledge of the alleged breach of the Treaty and of the incurred loss or damage.

The Tribunal’s first task is thus to determine the earliest possible date on which the
Claimant would have obtained knowledge of the alleged breach of the Treaty and of the
incurred loss or damage for the Claimant’s claims to have been submitted within the time
limit for the purpose of Article 10.18.1. That date is three years before the Claimant

submitted a claim to arbitration under Section 10 of DR-CAFTA.

There is little room for discussion about what is the critical date; as agreed by both
Parties'®>, it is uncontroversial that the Claimant submitted its claims to arbitration when it
initiated the present proceedings, i.e., by way of its Request for Arbitration which was
dated June 10, 2014. The application of Article 10.18.1 leads to the conclusion that the
critical date is three years earlier, i.e. June 10, 201 1.'8° As indicated above, the three-year
period is a strict one, no suspension or “tolling” of the three-year period is contemplated by
the Treaty. Both Parties agree on this date and there is no need for the Tribunal to postpone

its determination in this respect by going into further discussion and analysis.

'85 PO Rejoinder, 472, footnote 80.

'86 The Tribunal leaves to one side the United States’ submission that a request for arbitration is not perfected
until it is filed with a DR-CAFTA-compliant waiver. This point was not advanced by the Respondent, which
was content to proceed on the basis of the ICSID’s receipt of the RFA.

(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections

(2) Determination of the date when the Claimant acquired knowledge of the alleged
breach and of the damage
The second step in applying DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 requires the Tribunal to
determine the date on which the Claimant “first acquired, or should have first acquired,
knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.1 6.1 and knowledge that the claimant
(for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought under

Article 10.16.1(b) has incurred loss or damage.” A comparison of that date with the
‘critical date’ will then enable the Tribunal to decide whether it is competent to hear the
claims in this proceeding: Should the date on which the Claimant acquired actual or
constructive knowledge of the alleged breach and of the corresponding damage be earlier
than the critical date, the Tribunal would have to conclude that the Claimant’s Request for
Arbitration was submitted after the expiration of the limitation date and, as a consequence,

the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction to hear the Claimant’s claims.

a. One or several breaches?

As a preliminary matter, the Parties disagree on whether the Claimant’s claims, as set out
in its Request for Arbitration, must be treated as relating to one or several alleged breaches
of DR-CAFTA by the Respondent. In particular, the Claimant contends that, given that the
DR’s failure — in contradiction with its own law — to respond to the Claimant’s Motion for
Reconsideration constitutes a denial of justice, the relevant date of knowledge for the
purpose of Article 10.18.1 is the date of the alleged denial of justice and related loss or
damage. The question whether the omission complained of by the Claimant amounts to a
denial of justice is primarily one of substance, rather than jurisdiction. For the sake of
completeness of the Tribunal’s analysis, it will nevertheless be addressed in the following

section '®”,

At this stage, the Tribunal only needs to decide whether the failure to respond to the
Claimant’s Motion for Reconsideration would, if found to amount to a denial of justice,
constitute a breach of the Treaty that is separate from the non-issuance of the license. The
Claimant’s case on the merits, as set out in the Request for Arbitration, is built on the
187 See infra, at [238 ff.

an

(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections
premise that one measure adopted by the DR frustrated Corona Materials' efforts to build

and operate a construction aggregate mine in the DR in such a drastic way so as to amount

to a breach of the DR’s Treaty obligations.

The measure that is complained is described in paragraph 27 of the Request for

Arbitration:

“Despite repeated assurances and formal approvals from senior DR
government officials, including the President, that Corona Materials would be
permitted to construct and operate the proposed aggregate mine, the DR
ultimately denied Corona Materials a final environmental license for the
project for reasons that are empirically false and objectively discriminatory.”

Nevertheless, the Claimant argues that the DR’s violations of the Treaty did not stop with
the official decision not to grant the environmental license for the project. The fact that the
DR never responded to a Motion for Reconsideration of said decision is alleged to
constitute a further, separate breach in the form of a denial of justice, of which the

Claimant only gained knowledge after the critical date.

The Tribunal notes that, in this respect, the Claimant’s position is not free of an inherent
contradiction. On the one hand, the Claimant defends the idea of a continuing violation by
the Respondent of its substantive obligations under DR-CAFTA; on the other hand, the
Claimant, at least at the stage of its Counter-Memorial, and further in the proceedings, has
tried to sustain that the absence of response by the DR Environmental Ministry to its
“Motion for Reconsideration” is to be treated as a specific measure (or absence of measure)
which in itself would be constitutive of a separate violation of DR-CAFTA Article 10.5, as

it would be a denial of justice.

The first of these two options, a unified presentation of the DR’s breach of its obligation
was asserted in the Claimant’s Request for Arbitration:
“The DR failed to accord Corona Materials’ investment fair and equitable
treatment, as well as full protection and security, by repeatedly

discriminating against Corona Materials as foreign investor, denying
Corona Materials due process in the environmental licensing process and

reconsideration process” !*8

207. It was actually the same position that Mr. French, the Principal of Corona Materials present

in the DR, had also taken in a letter of February 23, 2011 to the DR’s Environmental
Ministry where he did not differentiate between the negative answer given on August 2010
to Corona Materials’ request for issuance of an environmental license and the persistent
absence of response to the Motion for Reconsideration addressed to the same Ministry and

submitted by Corona almost two months later, on October 5, 201089,

Still in its Counter-Memorial, the Claimant persisted in treating the environmental
application process as a single, uninterrupted event, arguing that “the Environmental

Impact Assessment procedure for the Project was initiated in 2007 and has never been

formally closed by the Respondent”.

Nevertheless, and in clear contrast with the preceding view, also in its Counter-Memorial,
the Claimant adopted another analysis. According to this second analysis, the very absence
of response to the Motion for Reconsideration should be treated as an autonomous breach
of international law, constitutive in itself of a denial of justice!®!. This articulation is even

more clearly sustained in the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief which declares that:

“[...] The Claimant’s case is a simple one. For over five-years-and-a-half,
the DR has failed to respond to the Claimant’s Motion for
Reconsideration, as it was obliged to under its own law.”

“That failure amounts to a denial of justice and a breach of the FET
Standard in Article 10.5. of CAFTA-DR. That breach is a separate and
distinct breach from (i) the Negative Environmental Decision [...] and (ii)
the other breaches of CAFTA-DR outlined in the Request. The elements of
Article 10.18.1 CAFTA-DR must be applied separately to each individual
breach, rather than to a conflation and aggregation of breaches, as the
DR purports”!”.

210. The Tribunal does not accept this position. As correctly stated by the Respondent, the

211.

212.

absence of a response to the Motion for Reconsideration cannot be considered as a stand-
alone “measure”, or a separate breach of the Treaty. The Tribunal agrees with the

Respondent’s analysis in that respect:

“[A]ll of the alleged breaches relate to the same theory of liability, which is
predicated on the notion that “the DR refused to permit Corona Materials to
proceed with its mining project for reasons that are not legitimate and which
are unrelated to the merits of that project,” and that “[d]ue to the refusal of
the Environmental License by the Respondent, the Claimant cannot enjoy any
meaningful benefit from the Joama Exploitation Concession ... .”. Even the
claim relating to the absence of a response to Claimant’s reconsideration
request rests on this theory of liability.” '°

In this context, the Respondent’s failure to reconsider the refusal to grant the license is
nothing but an implicit confirmation of its previous decision. As will be seen when the
Tribunal examines the issue of a denial of justice, the filing of a Motion for
Reconsideration cannot be considered as a separate action. There was no administrative
adjudicatory proceeding in existence at the time of the Motion’s submission. Indeed, the
very purpose of the Motion for Reconsideration was to have the Ministry re-open the
proceeding and render a different decision. In the Dominican Republic’s administrative
law as well in French administrative law, which the former took as a model, such an
initiative is a “recours gracieux” i.e., a non-contentious action, only aimed at having the
same administration review its own decision. '°4 There is therefore no basis to consider that

there was a continuing breach.

As recognized by Mr. French in his letter dated February 23, 2010 to the Environmental

Ministry’, the DR’s failure to respond to the Claimant’s Motion for Reconsideration was
understood by the Claimant itself at that time as not producing any separate effects on its

investment other than those that were already produced by the initial decision. Under the

93 Respondent’s PHB, (10.

Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections

circumstances, the State’s inaction following the Claimant’s efforts to have that very same

measure reconsidered cannot be considered a separate breach of the Treaty.

The discussion about the non-issuance of the license and the discussion about the failure to
respond to the Claimant’s Motion for Reconsideration did both relate to the exact and same
alleged breach of the Treaty. This was the conviction expressed by Mr. French himself,

still in his letter of February 23, 2011 to the Environmental Ministry, when he stated:

“After two hours speaking with five people, we were informed that after
the meeting with the delegates from Sanchez in their office on January
2011, personnel from Environmental Management had not worked or
advanced on the reconsideration of the application for JOAMA
Environmental License” '®

The Tribunal concludes that there is no valid basis for treating the alleged denial of justice

as distinct from the non-issuance of the environmental license.

In any event, even hypothetically assuming that the DR administration’s silence in reply to
the Motion for Reconsideration would amount to a denial of justice, which the Tribunal
does not consider to be the case here, it would remain, as rightly pointed out by the United

States in their submissions on questions of interpretation of the DR-CAFTA, that:

“Where a ‘series of similar and related actions by a respondent State’ is at
issue, an investor cannot evade the limitations period by basing its claim on
‘the most recent transgression in that series’!*’. To allow an investor to do
so would, as the tribunal in Grand River recognized, ‘render the limitations
provisions ineffective’!95”!?,

In light of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the relevant date of

knowledge for the purpose of Article 10.18.1 is the date on which the Claimant first

acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the Respondent’s decision not to

grant the environmental license for the Claimant’s project.

b. “Actual” or “constructive” knowledge?

As already noted above, DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 contemplates two forms of
knowledge of breach and loss or damage: actual knowledge — what the Claimant did in fact
know at a given time — and constructive knowledge — what the Claimant should have
known at a given time. For the running of the three-year period to be triggered, it is
sufficient that the Claimant acquired either actual or constructive knowledge. The Tribunal
shall first consider any evidence of the Claimant’s actual knowledge of the Respondent’s
decision not to grant the environmental license for the Claimant’s project; only when such
an inquiry would lead to the conclusion that actual knowledge was not acquired by the
Claimant before the critical date, would the Tribunal then need to engage in an objective
determination of whether in light of all the circumstances it can be held that the Claimant
should have first acquired knowledge of the breach and loss or damage at a particular point

in time.

c. Did the Claimant acquire actual knowledge of the breach?

The Tribunal thus turns to the evidence on the record, which is sufficient to answer this
question. The Claimant alleged in its Request for Arbitration that the DR breached several
provisions under Chapter 10 of the DR-CAFTA, in particular, Article 10.3 on National
Treatment, Article 10.5 on the requirement that covered investments be treated in
accordance with the Minimum Standard of Treatment under customary international law,

and Article 10.7 forbidding illegal expropriation.”

As noted above, however, with the exception of the export tax claim, the alleged breaches
relate to one central measure adopted by the Respondent: the Environment Ministry’s
refusal to grant the environmental license. Considering the documentary evidence on

record, that particular measure must be considered to have occurred on August 18, 2010,

which is the date on which the Environmental Ministry advised the Claimant of the
decision already taken on July 28, 2010 by the Technical Evaluation Committee of the
same Ministry. As of that date, Claimant knew that its license application was formally
rejected”*'; the letter was sent by Vice-Minister Reyna to the Claimant’s Principal present
in the DR, Mr. French, and it stated that the Joama environmental assessment resulted in a
finding by the Environment Ministry’s Technical Evaluation Committee that the project
was not environmentally viable; as a consequence, the letter indicated the Committee’s

formal decision to deny the Claimant’s license application.
In its relevant part, the August 18 letter reads as follows:

“We cordially write to you in regards to the “JOAMA Exploitation
Concession” Project . . . we hereby inform you of the results of the
evaluation of the information contained in the file, the review of the study,
and the technical evaluation visits made to the proposed area for the
development and operation of the mining exploitation Project.

The Technical Evaluation Committee met on 28 July 2010 and, as per
Resolution 737-10, evaluated the Technical Review Report (ITR) and the
file submitted for the above referenced project; it has been determine [sic]
that this project is not environmentally viable ....

[...]

Therefore, this Ministry hereby informs you of the closure of your file,
allowing the company to have an opportunity to select a new alternative site
for the development of its proposal.

As Mr. French is one of Corona’s three principals, there is no doubt that the day on which
he received that letter must be considered to be the date on which the Claimant first gained

actual knowledge of the non-issuance of the license.

It is worth mentioning that the August 18, 2010 letter is not a mere notification of the
decision; it further sets out a clear indication of the decision’s final character insofar as the
environmental authorities were concerned, by their indicating the “closure of [Corona’s]

file”.

The Claimant’s actual knowledge of the Environment Ministry’s measure and of its
definitive character is confirmed by its own letter to the Environment Ministry dated
October 5, 2010, in which it complained about the decision and asked the Ministry to
reconsider it. In this letter, the Claimant acknowledges receipt of the August 18, 2010

closure of its file:

“We respectfully address you for you to reconsider and open the file of the

of August 18, 20102.

The evidence further shows that, in January/February 2011, the Claimant already
considered the DR’s refusal to grant the license amounted to a violation of its obligations
under DR-CAFTA. In particular, at the Hearing, Mr. French confirmed that he had already
begun exploring the possibility of a DR-CAFTA arbitration in January 2011.7°° Having
made this view known to the Environmental Ministry, Claimant was told by CEI-RD that if
it decided to pursue the DR-CAFTA arbitration option, it should contact the Directorate of
Foreign Trade (DICOEX)””.

On January 21, 2011, Mr. French sent an e-mail to his partner in which he wrote:

“the timing may be ripe to formally lodge an investor-state dispute notice
with CEI the office of exportation and foreign investments for an obscene
amount of damages.”?""

227. In this respect, a specific piece of evidence of the Claimant’s own making demonstrates
that, at the latest at the end of February 2011, the Claimant had without doubt acquired
actual knowledge of the two elements required by DR-CAFTA Article 18.10.1 in order for
the limitation period to start running: First, that a potential breach of the Treaty could be
claimed against the Respondent; second, as it will be confirmed later in this Award, that
this breach had caused serious loss or damage to Corona. This evidence, already referred to
several times in the present Award, is the letter sent by the Claimant to the Environment
Ministry on February 23, 20117°8 in which Mr. French tried to exert some pressure on the

Minister in order to finally get a reconsideration of the decision notified on August 18 of

the previous year. In this letter, Mr. French declared in particular:

“The Partners of Corona in Florida believe that Environmental
Management may be unaware of the substantive obligations of Article 10
of the DR-CAFTA that protects foreign investors like us. According to
them, Environmental Management has seriously violated these protection
provisions on various occasions”?°?

228. Mr. French became even more precise in terms of identifying the substantive obligations

that the Dominican Republic could be reputed to have violated. He added:

“The ‘Fair and Equitable Treatment’ in Article 10...requires certain level
of rule of law within the host country which encapsulates the obligation to
act in a coherent manner, without ambiguity and with total transparency,
not arbitrary and in accordance with the principle of good faith. Also, the
investors may expect due process in processing their claims and that
authorities actions are taken in a non-discriminatory manner and
proportionate to the political objectives involved”?!

229. The Claimant’s repeated reference to the rights it enjoys as a foreign investor under DR-
CAFTA and to the numerous alleged Treaty violations by the DR shows that Corona
Materials not only was aware of the alleged breach, and set out a non-exhaustive list of
nine such breaches in the same letter, but it was already explicitly considering resorting to
208 (R-2). See supra, 449.

arbitration?!', Already on February 4, 2011, in an e-mail sent to the DR Export and

Investment Agency (CEI-RD), Mr. French had declared:

“If you would like to see the other 11 reasons why we believe this
department has treated us unfairly and inequitably, I am tempted to
forward the draft of the ‘Notice of Arbitration’ prepared in Washington
which I am sitting on...”?!?

It is equally plain that, at the same time, Mr. French had already acquired the conviction
that Corona’s Motion for Reconsideration of the refusal of the environmental license

would not receive any positive response. At the Hearing, Mr. French declared:

“We felt completely let down after the meeting on the 20" [of January
2011] with the community where they [the Ministry officials] said they
were going to reconsider, and nothing happened, so we felt we’d been lied
and cheated”?",

The Tribunal furthermore notes that the Claimant itself stated in its Rejoinder that:

“There can be no doubt that apart from the (i) lapse of time, combined
with (ii) the Respondent’s inaction, there have been no material
developments concerning the factual background of the case since early
2011". 2!4

As for any meetings alleged to have taken place in June 2011, the Tribunal notes that
Claimant neither submitted any direct testimony from the Corona consultant(s) who

allegedly attended the meeting?!>

, Nor gave any undisputed date on which such a meeting
would have taken place; more generally, nor was any documentary evidence provided to

the Tribunal in relation with the effective realization of any meeting in June 2011.

The Tribunal must now turn to the issue whether the Claimant also had actual knowledge

of the fact that it had incurred loss or damage from the DR’s measure

d. Did the Claimant acquire actual knowledge of the loss or damage?

The answer to this question cannot be other than positive, as the Claimant, during the same
period, proved not only to be conscious of the reality of damage caused by the DR refusal
to grant the environmental license but was even able to evaluate it. Still in the letter of 23

February 2011 referred to above, Mr. French stated, inter alia, that:

“[I]f the Environmental License and the Terms of Reference for the
Private Port are not issued the damages to Corona arising directly from
the violations of [Environmental] Management would be USD 342
Million.”?'®

The same was confirmed by Mr. French at the Hearing.?!”

(3) Conclusion

To sum up, the Tribunal is able to observe that a number of elements, and in particular the
February 23, 2011 letter constitutes clear evidence of the fact that, on that date at the latest,
the rejection of the application for an environmental license and the failure to address the
Motion for Reconsideration (among other alleged acts and omissions by the Dominican
Republic) was considered by the Claimant to amount to a violation by the DR of several
provisions of DR-CAFTA Chapter 10, and that such alleged breaches caused loss or

damage that the Claimant quantified in specific terms.

Considering that (i) the DR’s act constituting the alleged breach occurred at the latest,
August 2010, (ii) the Claimant gained knowledge of that act on August 18, 2010, (iii) the
Claimant manifested its opinion that said act constituted a breach of the Treaty in January
and February 2011, (iv) the Claimant manifested its awareness in February 2011 that it
would suffer harm as a result, and (v) all these dates are prior to the “critical date” of June
10, 2011, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant failed to submit its claims to arbitration

within the time limit set out in DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1.

(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections
The record shows that the Claimant had actual knowledge of the alleged breach and of the
corresponding damage or harm before the critical date. It derives from the evidence
reviewed above that Claimant concluded well before the critical date that DR-CAFTA had
been effectively breached and that such breach had produced substantial loss or damage.
As a matter of fact, the Claimant did not submit its Request for Arbitration until June 10,
2014, which is 3 years, 3 months, and 19 days later. As a consequence, its claims are time-

barred by DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1.

E. The issue of a Denial of Justice

239.

240.

241.

The Tribunal could simply end its task at this juncture and consider that it has already
fulfilled its task, having firmly reached the conclusion that, in application of DR-CAFTA
Article 10.18.1, it has no jurisdiction over the case filed by the Claimant. It is even more so
that there is no difference between the non-issuance of the license and the absence of
answer to the request for its reconsideration. The two are parts and parcel of the same

conduct, contrary to the Claimant’s allegations.

That said, although the claim could be disposed of based on the Tribunal’s prior findings,
the Tribunal considers it appropriate to address what increasingly took a more prominent
positon in the Claimant’s claim as the proceeding unfolded, namely that the Dominican
Republic committed a denial of justice against it. During the Hearing as well as in its Post-

Hearing Brief, this was identified by the Claimant as the “central issue”?!*.

Particular emphasis was placed on this argument because, whilst the letter sent to the
Environmental Ministry asking for reconsideration of the refusal of environmental license
to the Joama Project was dispatched to Vice-Minister Reyna on October 5, 2010, i.e., well
before the critical date of June 10, 2011, there was no written response to it. As seen above,
this alleged failure to respond is submitted by the Claimant to constitute a continuing act
that both falls within the Tribunal’s temporal jurisdiction and, having allegedly persisted to
the present day, constitutes a denial of justice in breach of DR-CAFTA Article 10.5.1. To

quote again the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief:

243. DR-CAFTA Article 10.5.2 elaborates upon the preceding subparagraph as follows:

international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the

required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights.

“any judicial or administrative act which deprives a citizen of any of the essential

equitable treatment standard is expressly stated to include the obligation not to deny justice

in criminal, civil or administrative adjudicatory proceedings.

As recounted in the procedural history above, acting in its capacity as a DR-CAFTA Party,
the United States expressed its view that the minimum standard of treatment “is an
umbrella concept reflecting a set of rules that, over time, has crystallized into customary

international law” 74

The Claimant characterized the US Submission as “an amalgamation of passages taken
verbatim from various earlier submissions made by the United States of America in various
DR-CAFTA and NAFTA cases” and thus was not a position formulated specifically for this
case concerning the particular facts before this Tribunal.”??> Since it did not address the
facts, the submission was, in Corona’s view, an “abstract and theoretical” view of a Non-
Disputing Party.?”° That said, the Claimant did state its agreement “with the United States’
general description of a denial of justice” in paragraphs 12 and 13 of the US Submission,
while adding three qualifications: (i) a denial of justice can be committed under
international law by the administrative branch of the State;2” (ii) the requirement of
exhaustion of local remedies under international investment treaty law is a matter of
substance and not of jurisdiction/admissibility;?”* and (iii) the question of whether there
has been a denial of justice should be analyzed in each case with regard to the particular

remedies available to an injured party.?2°

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal begins by noting the Claimant’s observation that a denial of justice can arise
under international law by an act of the administrative branch of the State. To the extent
that a denial of justice can originate in a State’s administrative act, the Tribunal agrees that
this is the case. However, as discussed further below, the Tribunal does not believe that an
administrative act, in and of itself, particularly as the level of a first instance decision-
maker, can constitute a denial of justice under customary international law, when further

remedies or avenues of appeal are potentially available under municipal law.

With respect to the Claimant’s third qualification of its general approval of the United
States’ position, articulated at paragraphs 12-13 of the US Submission, the Tribunal agrees
that the question of whether there has been a denial of justice should be analyzed in each
case with regard to the particular remedies available to an injured party. In addition, while
it agrees with the Claimant’s observation that the requirement of exhaustion of local
remedies under international investment treaty law is a matter of substance and not of
jurisdiction/admissibility, that condition does not preclude the Tribunal’s consideration of
the denial of justice claim at this stage of the proceedings. DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.4
refers to the Tribunal’s “authority to address other objections as a preliminary question.”?*!
Further, DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.5 directs that the Tribunal “shall decide on an expedited
basis an objection under paragraph 4.”23> DR-CAFTA’s expedited procedure does not
preclude a tribunal from considering an issue going to the substance of a case if the
tribunal finds that it is appropriate to consider such an issue based on the facts as pleaded
by the Claimant. In the present circumstances, the Tribunal considers that it is in a position
to consider the issue, which, in any event, turns on an interpretation of the DR-CAFTA and

the rules of international law.

Although the Claimant asserted that a denial of justice can result from “any judicial or

administrative act which deprives a citizen of any of the essential guarantees granted to

331 DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.4.
232 DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.5.

Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections
him by law”,?** the DR-CAFTA is not drafted in such broad terms. Article 10.5.2(a)’s
treatment of denial of justice focuses on different forms of “adjudicatory proceedings”, be
they criminal, civil or administrative. The inclusion of the word “adjudicatory” assumes
importance because it requires a tribunal to focus on the nature of the State’s measure(s) at
issue. That is, not all criminal, civil or administrative matters, acts or procedures fall within
the scope of DR-CAFTA Article 10.5.1 such that they are capable of giving rise to an

international claim for denial of justice.

Adjudicatory proceedings that do fall within the scope of DR-CAFTA Article 10.5.1 are
governed by “the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the
world.”*+ The precise wording of DR-CAFTA Article 10.5.2 immediately raises
questions about the validity of the Claimant’s claim because the administrative proceeding
in respect of which the Motion for Reconsideration was made was, as the Respondent
noted, and the Tribunal has agreed, completed on August 18, 2010 with the file closed as
of that date.?*° As already indicated above with regard to the nature of the Motion for

Reconsideration?”©

, the Tribunal considers that there was no administrative adjudicatory
proceeding in existence at the time of the Motion’s submission. Indeed the very purpose of
the Motion was to have the Ministry re-open the proceeding and render a different
decision. In the Tribunal’s view, it would be straining the meaning of the term
“administrative adjudicatory proceeding” to treat the Ministry’s receipt of such a motion
and alleged inaction as in itself an “adjudicatory proceeding.” The Claimant certainly
hoped that its Motion for Reconsideration would prompt the authorities to re-open the
matter, but no action was taken on the request and no adjudicatory proceeding was

launched.

application file has been closed. Moreover, the Claimant apprehends that “the letter . . . dfoes] not set out any

procedure by which the decision could be appealed or could be submitted for reconsideration.” [Footnote

references omitted].

Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections

In this regard, the Tribunal concurs with the Respondent’s analysis of this aspect of the

Claimant’s case:

“In the present case, there is no valid basis for treating the alleged denial
of justice as distinct from the license denial. To proceed on the basis of
such a distinction, Claimant would need to have asserted at least a

plausible denial of justice claim. Yet, what Claimant attempts to label as a
denial of justice — a failure by the State to respond to a one-page letter —

simply cannot under any conception amount to a denial of justice under

international law, no_matter_how_much_time_may_have_ elapsed. As
Claimant acknowledged in its Rejoinder, the alleged denial of justice here
is not like that alleged in any other investment treaty case in the record.
“All the [other] cases involved legal proceedings which — in varying
degrees of speed — moved forward.” Here, there simply was not any
“proceeding” at all — just the absence of a response to Claimant’s
letter.”?57

The Tribunal turns to the next point in the analysis. Even if the Motion for Reconsideration
were considered to have triggered an administrative adjudicatory proceeding, as the
Claimant itself acknowledged, the question of whether there has been a denial of justice
should be analyzed in each case with regard to the particular remedies available to an
injured party.7** This is an important point because administrative adjudicatory
proceedings typically do not take place in a legal vacuum; the acts of such adjudicators are
typically reviewable in the local courts. Put another way, administrative decision-making is

situated within a broader framework of a State’s legal system.

The international delict of denial of justice rests upon a specific predicate, namely, the
systemic failure of the State’s justice system. When a claim is successfully made out at
international law, it is because the international court or tribunal accepts that the
respondent’s legal system as a whole has failed to accord justice to the claimant. The

Claimant itself noted in its comments on the US Submission:

“In Unglaube, the Tribunal held (the Claimant submits, correctly) that a
denial of justice is concerned not with whether a particular domestic

decision was right or wrong, but with the systemic deficiency of the host
state to render justice”.?°?

The Claimant’s Rejoinder also recognized the need for the investor’s having taken

domestic remedies if it wished to make out a claim for denial of justice:

46. [. . .] [T]here remains a question as to whether a state can be held
internationally liable for acts (judgments, decisions and so forth) of its
organs (including courts and administrative bodies), which could have
been — but were not — appealed by the investor.

47. The broad consensus, supported by a number of investment treaty
cases, is that the state is not so liable if the investor failed to take such
domestic remedies... 74°

The Claimant was correct on this point. Several other international law decisions support
the conclusion that the State is not liable if the investor failed to take such domestic
remedies. In Apotex Inc. v. United States the tribunal similarly noted that denial of justice

claims:

“[D]epend upon the demonstration of a systemic failure in the judicial
system. Hence, a claimant cannot raise a claim that a judicial act
constitutes a breach of international law, without first proceeding through
the judicial system that it purports to challenge, and thereby allowing the
system an opportunity to correct itself.”?4!

The tribunal in Loewen v. United States likewise expressed the view that the purpose of
exhaustion of local remedies is to give the respondent State an opportunity to correct its
alleged breach”. These cases, cited by the Respondent, are only two of a large number of

cases that could be cited in support of the proposition, for instance the Jan de Nul v. Egypt

through its legal system the inchoate breach of international law occasioned by the lower court decision.”

Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections
Case,743 or the AMTO v. Ukraine Case, in which the tribunal emphasized the need to
consider the State’s legal system as a whole, to assess the propriety of the act against the
availability of means to address errors or injustices, and the importance of the investor’s
own responsibility for the outcome”. In the case of Duke Energy v. Ecuador, the tribunal
took the view that the claimant “never challenged the final arbitral award before the
Ecuadorian courts, and therefore “the Ecuadorian system never came into play on the

award.”45

Scholars have likewise described exhaustion of local remedies as a “prerequisite to a valid
complaint that the alien has been denied justice.”*4° Jan Paulsson, whose short but cogent
treatment of the subject, Denial of Justice, was cited by the Claimant itself, is frequently

quoted on the issue, stated:

“For a foreigner’s international grievance to proceed as a claim of denial
of justice, the national system must have been tested. Its perceived failings
cannot constitute an international wrong unless it has been given a chance
to correct itself...

[I]t is in the very nature of the delict that a state is judged by the final
product — or at least a sufficiently final product — of its administration of
justice. A denial of justice is not consummated by the decision of a court of
first instance. Having sought to rely on national justice, the foreigner
cannot complain that its operations have been delictual until he has given
it scope to operate, including by the agency of its ordinary corrective
functions. ”?47

The Tribunal shares this view. Exhaustion of local remedies is, as the Claimant correctly
pointed out in its Rejoinder, typically not a jurisdictional prerequisite to an investor’s
submitting an international claim, but the exhaustion of local remedies is relevant in a

consideration of the merits, as a substantive element of the alleged breach.

(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections
In order to exhaust local remedies, the general requirement (subject to the futility exception
discussed below) is as expressed by the United States in its intervention: the investor “must
proceed to the highest court in the whole system, which may include more than one line of
tribunals or courts where the legal system of the respondent or host state has a multiple
hierarchy of fora which can provide redress.”*48
As recognized by the US Submission and by the Parties themselves, there is an exception
to the requirement to exhaust local remedies, where seeking such an appeal domestically
would be obviously futile or manifestly ineffective’, a position which finds support in a
number of international investor/State arbitration awards, in particular in Loewen v. United
States, where the tribunal found that the claimant's obligation to seek a remedy from higher

99250

courts was subject to “reasonable practical limitations or in Apotex v. United States, in

which the tribunal similarly emphasized the importance of proving that the available

recourse was “manifestly ineffective””*!.

Having regard to the clear position at international law, as pleaded, the Claimant’s case on
denial of justice must fail because it can point to no act or any administrative adjudicatory
proceeding before any court or administrative adjudicatory body in the Dominican
Republic beyond the unanswered Motion for Reconsideration which, as noted above, did
not itself amount to an administrative adjudicatory proceeding. In this context, a mere
failure to answer the Motion cannot by any objective measure be equated to a denial of
justice at international law. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent’s

characterization of the steps taken by Claimant:

“Claimant has not adduced any evidence that it exhausted local remedies,
either in connection with the license denial or the non-response to its
reconsideration request. In fact, and to the contrary, Claimant conceded

that it chose for tactical reasons to forgo a local litigation option.” 5?

The Respondent submits that the Claimant chose not to bring a judicial challenge against
the license denial because “the Claimant was resolutely determined to move forward with
the Project.”?°*After the Hearing, the Claimant sought to qualify its position in its Post-
Hearing Brief, arguing that:

“[T]he denial of justice arises out of an excessive delay in rendering the

decision in response to the filed Motion for Reconsideration, and that the
local remedies rule should not apply.”?>4

The Tribunal does not agree with this submission, because a finding of denial of justice
under international law necessarily depends on the final product of the State’s domestic
legal system. Since, as the United States put it, the “responsibility [of a State] is engaged
as the result of a definitive judicial decision by a court of last resort”,?> there can be no
denial of justice without a final decision of a State’s highest judicial authority.?° In the
instant case, not only is there no final decision of a State’s highest judicial authority, there
is no decision of an administrative adjudicatory body or judicial authority at all. In the
end, faced with no official response to its Motion, the Claimant failed to take any step in

proceedings for administrative or judicial review. Yet, as the Claimant itself recognized:

“The lapse of two months enables the individuals to issue a complaint
against administrative inaction by filing a claim before an administrative
court. This, as recognised by the own DR’s expert, is a presumption
envisaged for the protection of an individual, to enable them to challenge
decisions of the administration before the courts.””*"

Based on the Claimant’s allegations and the evidence submitted by the Parties in this
arbitration, it has not been shown that taking a further step in the domestic legal system of

the Dominican Republic would have been futile or manifestly ineffective.

(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3)
Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections

Finally, the Claimant is incorrect in contending that the waiver required to submit this
international claim for damages barred it from challenging the alleged failure to act on the
Motion for Reconsideration. In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant submitted that it was
prohibited from exhausting local remedies by the waiver required under DR-CAFTA
Annex 10E:

“Annex IOE of CAFTA-DR contains a “fork in the road” provision for
claims brought against the DR. An investor must elect to either (i) submit
its claim to arbitration or (ii) to bring its claim before a local court or
administrative tribunal. It cannot do both. To require an investor to
exhaust local remedies prior to submitting its claim to arbitration, the very
consequence of which would be to prevent the investor from submitting
that claim to arbitration, would make a mockery of the protections
guaranteed under Chapter 10 CAFTA-DR.”?°*

For its part, the Respondent submitted that:

“Claimant misunderstands the Annex I10E requirement, as a claim by
Walvis (rather than Corona) in a Dominican court, for asserted violations

of Dominican law, would not have triggered the fork-in-the-road

clause.”

In the Tribunal’s view, the waiver required to submit a claim to international arbitration
pursuant to DR-CAFTA Chapter 10 is clear in its terms. Article 10.18.2 first requires the
claimant (whether claiming on its own behalf or on behalf of an enterprise) to waive “any
right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any
Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure
alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16”, this requirement is immediately

qualified by the article’s subparagraph 3 which provides:

“3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2(b), the claimant (for claims brought
under Article 10.16.1(a)) and the claimant or the enterprise (for claims
brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) may initiate or continue an action that
seeks interim injunctive relief and does not involve _the_payment_of

monetary damages before a judicial _or administrative tribunal_of the
respondent, provided that the action is brought for the sole purpose of

258 Claimant’ s PHB, {{5(b).

preserving the claimant’s or the enterprise’s rights and interests during

the pendency of the arbitration.” 7°
Thus, an action seeking interim injunctive relief not involving the payment of damages is
available to a DR-CAFTA claimant (or its enterprise) while it pursues its DR-CAFTA

claim for damages.

DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.4 then sets out the ‘fork in the road’ provision. But this applies
only to claims of an alleged breach of an obligation under Section A of Chapter 10 in
proceedings before a court or administrative tribunal of a Central American State Party or
the Dominican Republic. Annex 10-E applies to claims by US investors only.”°! This ‘fork
in the road’ is clearly intended to deal with the situation in certain civil law countries
where international treaties have direct effect and thus an alleged breach of an international
treaty can form a cause of action under the domestic law of such States. The Claimant
would have fallen afoul of this provision if Walvis (or Corona) had submitted a claim in
the local courts for the “same alleged breach” (i.e., a breach of Section A of Chapter 10 of
DR-CAFTA) as in the present proceeding.” If Walvis had submitted an administrative
contentious proceeding which did not invoke DR-CAFTA’s Chapter 10, it would not have
run afoul of Article 10.18.4.

For all of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal considers that Corona’s denial of justice
claim is “not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under
Article 10.26”.°% The Tribunal concludes by reiterating its statement already formulated
above at paragraphs 237-238, according to which, the Claimant not having satisfied the
conditions required under DR-CAFTA Article 18.10.1, its request for arbitration was time-

barred, and the present Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the claims.

COSTS

DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.6 provides:

“When it decides a respondent’s objection under paragraph 4 or 5, the
tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party
reasonable costs and attorney’s fees incurred in submitting or opposing the
objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal
shall consider whether either the claimant’s claim or the respondent’s
objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable
opportunity to comment.”

Article 58 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules provides:

“(1) Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by
whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and
charges of the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with the proceeding shall be borne. The Tribunal may, to that end,
call on the Secretariat and the parties to provide it with the information it
needs in order to formulate the division of the cost of the proceeding between
the parties.

(2) The decision of the Tribunal pursuant to paragraph (1) of this Article shall

form part of the award.”
The Arbitral Tribunal has offered to the Parties the opportunity to express their comments
on the possibility to award costs with respect to the decision on the Preliminary Objections.

Both Parties have expressed comments in this regard.

The Claimant has filed a Cost Submission stating that its legal fees and expenses incurred
in the arbitration amount to US$1,121,972.79; the Respondent has also filed a cost
submission stating that its legal fees and expenses incurred in the arbitration amount to
US$1,685,991.00. The Parties have advanced US$200,000.00 each on account of the fees
and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the ICSID administrative fees and
expenses (the “Arbitration Costs”). Both Parties seek an award for the entirety of their

respective legal fees and expenses and Arbitration Costs.

When deciding how the arbitral costs should be apportioned between the Parties, the

Arbitral Tribunal notes its discretion to allocate costs and expenses in accordance both with

Award on the Respondent’s Expedited Preliminary Objections
the DR-CAFTA and the Arbitration Additional Facility Rules. In determining the

allocation of costs, the Arbitral Tribunal has taken into account all of the circumstances of

the present arbitration.

The Respondent has prevailed entirely as a matter of jurisdiction. The question arises
whether, as a consequence, the Claimant should bear more than half of the arbitration costs

and/or pay the Respondent’s legal fees and other arbitration costs.

Looking at DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.6, the immediate test for the Arbitral Tribunal is to
determine whether the claim was “frivolous”. The Arbitral Tribunal finds that the facts
surrounding the dispute and the allegations made demonstrate that the Claimant — even if it
was wrong in the construction and application of the DR-CAFTA to said facts — had a
bona fide claim and did not act with such wanton disregard of the facts and the law as to

permit this tribunal to consider that its claim was “frivolous”.

Furthermore, in the present case, neither of the Parties has presented its case in a way
justifying the shifting of arbitral costs against it. To the contrary, counsel for both Parties

worked professionally and efficiently in pursuing their clients’ interests.

Accordingly, each of the Parties shall be liable to pay half of the Arbitration Costs. Each
Party shall also bear its own legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with presenting

its case.
