Il. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

On April 2, 2015, the Tribunal rendered the Award on Jurisdiction in this arbitration, whereby it
decided:

“(a) That is does not have jurisdiction to hear Claimant's claims in this case, and

(b) To defer the decision regarding the allocation of the costs of this arbitration to a
future award.”*

On April 13, 2015, the Tribunal notified the Award on Jurisdiction to the disputing parties.

By e-mail of April 15, 2015, the Tribunal invited the disputing parties “[..] to try to agree on a
timetable for submitting their respective statement of costs and rebuttals and, to the extent
possible, to present a joint timetable to the Tribunal by April 22, 2015. If the disputing parties
are not able to agree on a joint timetable, each disputing party shall submit its proposed

timetable to the Tribunal by the same date.”

By e-mail of April 21, 2015, the disputing parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement to

“make simultaneous submissions regarding costs on May 20, 2015 at 5pm EST.”
By e-mail of May 19, 2015, the disputing parties’ informed the Tribunal that:

“[...] The parties have conferred further, however, and have agreed that, because
Canada’s May 20 submission will be the first time DIBC is able to view a schedule of the
costs of arbitration sought by Canada, if agreeable to the Tribunal, DIBC may submit a
reply brief on May 27, 2015 at 5pm that will be limited to a discussion of Canada’s
schedule of costs. Further, and again if agreeable to the Tribunal, Canada then may
submit a reply brief on June 3, 2015 at 5pm that will be limited to discussion of DIBC’s
response to Canada’s schedule.”

On May 20, 2015, the disputing parties’ submitted their respective Submissions on Costs.
On May 27, 2015, DIBC submitted its Reply Submission on Costs.
On June 3, 2015, Canada submitted its Reply Submission on Costs.

On July 29, 2015, the Tribunal received the Final Statement of Account from the Permanent
Court of Arbitration (“PCA”).

I. SUMMARY OF THE DISPUTING PARTIES’ POSITIONS
A. RESPONDENT’S POSITION
(1) Summary of Canada’s position on the allocation of costs

Pursuant to NAFTA Article 1135 and Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules, Respondent requests

that the Tribunal award Canada all of its costs’.

The costs incurred by Canada, pursuant to Article 40(2)(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules, including

legal fees and disbursements, are set forth below:

 

 

 

 

 

 

Summary of Costs ($ CDN)
Disbursements $ 437,458.58
Legal Representation® $ 3,015,557.37
TOTAL $ 3,453,015.95

 

 

Canada submits that the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules, and more specifically its Article 42, contain a
presumption that the unsuccessful party will bear both the costs of arbitral and institutional fees
and reasonable legal representation costs.’ It argues that cotemporary practice in international

investment treaty arbitration favors a “loser pays” or “cost follow the event” approach.*

According to Canada this is particularly true in disputes governed by the 2010 UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules where Article 42 was specifically amended from Article 40 of the 1976
UNCITRAL Rules to include legal fees in the costs of arbitration rather than leaving legal fees to

the discretion of the Tribunal.”

Canada relies on S.D. Myers and International Thunderbird cases, where both tribunals noted that
the UNCITRAL Rules emphasize “success” and establish a presumption that the costs of

arbitration should be borne by the unsuccessful party.'°

29.

Canada submits that the Tribunal should look at all the circumstances to decide which party is the
“successful” one. As Canada discussed in its memorials in this arbitration, the Tribunal was
without jurisdiction due to Claimant’s failure to comply with Article 1121 of the NAFTA. The
Tribunal ultimately decided for Canada in this respect based on the overlap of the First Notice of
Arbitration in the NAFTA proceedings and the first claim in the Washington Litigation alone. In
doing so, the Tribunal found it unnecessary to decide any further arguments put forward by the
parties with respect to jurisdiction. Canada concludes that it is the only successful party in this
arbitration as every point that was decided by the Tribunal was in Canada’s favour — Claimant did

not win on any argument it put forward with respect to those issues.'!

Moreover, Canada submits that its costs in this arbitration are reasonable in light of the length of
the dispute (2010-2015), the seriousness of the allegations, the amount of damages claimed and
the amount of resources required to prepare for and defend the arbitration. Combined, the
Claimant’s first Notice of Intent (“NOI”) and second NOI alleged USD 5 billion in damages
against Canada, which by far is the highest claim in the history of NAFTA arbitrations. '2

DIBC complains that Canada’s lawyers spent more time on this NAFTA arbitration than DIBC’s
lawyers. However, it is inappropriate and misleading to compare Canada’s legal costs to that of
DIBC’s counsel. Disparity between the legal costs of the opposing parties does not imply that the
higher costs incurred by one party are not reasonable. This is particularly true here given that
DIBC submitted duplicative pleadings in this NAFTA arbitration and the Washington Litigation
and relied on the same documents in both proceedings, thereby reducing the amount of time spent
on this NAFTA arbitration. It was DIBC that benefited from what it has described as “synergies

between the various proceedings”, not Canada. '*

Canada submits that no costs related to domestic proceedings were included in Canada’s

Submission on Costs.’

(2) Canada’s Request

Pursuant to NAFTA Article 1135 and Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules, DIBC must bear the
cost of Canada’s legal representation and arbitration costs. In light of the Claimant’s loss on
jurisdiction in this case, and on the basis of Canada’s longest-standing Article 1121 objection
with respect to the Washington Litigation, the Tribunal should award Canada all of its costs. Such
an award is directly in line with the purpose of Article 1121 and is the only way in which Canada
can be fully indemnified for having to defend itself with respect to the measures alleged to breach

the NAFTA in multiple forms.'°

B. CLAIMANT’S POSITION

(1) Summary of DIBC’s position on the allocation of costs

DIBC submits that the typical course of practice with respect to the award of costs in international
investment treaty arbitration is for the tribunal to direct that the parties evenly split the costs of
arbitration other than legal fees and for each party to bear its own legal costs. Only a small
minority of tribunals in such proceedings require an unsuccessful investor claimant to pay the
arbitration costs and costs of representation of the government respondent. The exceptions to this
prevailing practice generally include cases where the tribunal has determined that the claim was
manifestly without merit or that its prosecution by the claimant or its counsel fell below common

accepted professional standards. '°

The purpose of this policy against awarding costs in favour of a successful respondent is to avoid
placing additional constraints on the access to justice for investors, who are frequently at a

pronounced resource disadvantage compared to respondents.”

According to DIBC, Tribunals order parties to bear their own costs in arbitrations in close to
eighty percent of cases. DIBC submits that Canada itself has noted the same when it was

unsuccessful in investment arbitrations. '*

This is particularly appropriate here, where, although Canada seeks legal fees and expenses with
respect to the entirety of the arbitration proceedings, this Tribunal decided only a single issue
against DIBC in its Award — i.e., the question of whether DIBC properly issued a waiver under
Article 1121 of the NAFTA. This is the only issue with respect to which DIBC can be said to
have been “unsuccessful” under the meaning of Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules, and Canada
has no right to seek recovery of costs of arbitration or the legal fees relating to any other aspect of

the arbitration.'”

DIBC relies, inter alia, on the Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. United States of America”” case. In this case,
despite the fact that the claimant “failed with respect to both of its claims,” the tribunal found that
the “Claimant raised difficult and complicated claims based at least one area of unsettled law, and
both Parties well argued their positions with considerable legal talent and respect for one another,
the process and the Tribunal”. The tribunal therefore ordered that “[e]ach Party shall bear its own

legal costs of representation.””!

Furthermore, DIBC submits that, while this arbitration did not proceed to the merits phase,
DIBC’s argument that the Tribunal did have jurisdiction to hear DIBC’s claim was complex and
made in good faith. DIBC’s argument that it made a proper waiver in compliance with NAFTA
Article 1121 was sufficiently meritorious that Judge Chertoff dissented from the panel’s
determination with respect to waiver.”* DIBC concludes that whatever expenses the parties have
incurred in this arbitration have resulted from the DIBC’s presentment of complex and novel

claims, and not from any dilatory or vexatious practices by DIBC.”>

DIBC also submits that Canada’s request for reimbursement of 14,943.20 hours in fees for
attorneys and paralegals is incommensurate with the nature of this arbitration, which had only

two, relatively short in-person hearings, and was dismissed at the jurisdictional phase.”4

The exorbitant nature of Canada’s claim for legal fees and expenses here is also demonstrated by
the stark contrast between the nearly 15,000 hours of attorney and paralegal time Canada seeks
recovery for and the approximately 4,100 attorney and paralegal hours DIBC devoted to the same
matter (3,616.8 hours billed by Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP, and approximately 500 hours
billed by prior counsel.). That is, Canada claims to have devoted more than three times the
amount of attorney and paralegal hours to this matter than did DIBC. Although there are different
approaches to arbitration and litigation generally, Canada’s claimed legal fees are not reasonable
by any measure. They equate to a lawyer devoting five 3,000 hour billable years to a matter that

ended in the jurisdictional phase.”°

DIBC submits that, although Canada provide little information regarding the legal fees and
expenses for which it seeks reimbursement, certain of the information provided by Canada

suggests that its legal fees do not solely relate to this proceedings.”

Finally, with respect to Canada’s preparation for its defense on the merits against DIBC’s claims,
Canada specifically asked this Tribunal to set a hearing with respect to jurisdiction before
reaching the merits, presumably in an effort to reduce expenses and effort with respect to the
merits. To the extent that Canada nonetheless chose to devote thousands of hours of attorney and
paralegal time to the development of its merits strategy, that approach was not reasonable under
the circumstances. Moreover, awarding such fees and expenses to Canada at this stage would be
particularly unjust in the event that DIBC institutes a new arbitration with respect to this dispute

and is successful on the merits there.””
(2) DIBC’s Request

DIBC requests that the Tribunal issue an order directing that each party bear its own costs of
representation, and that all other costs of arbitration be divided evenly between the parties.

Alternatively, the most that the Tribunal should award against DIBC are costs associated with the

?5 DIBC’s Reply Submission on Costs, May 2, 2015, § 7.

Article 1121 waiver issue and not any costs associated with the time limitations argument, the

merits, or any other aspect of the arbitration with respect to which the Tribunal issued no ruling.”

Il. THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION
A. PRELIMINARY REMARKS

By way of reminder, on April 2, 2015, the Tribunal rendered the Award on Jurisdiction in this

arbitration, whereby it decided:

“(a) That is does not have jurisdiction to hear Claimant's claims in this case, and

(b) To defer the decision regarding the allocation of the costs of this arbitration to a
future award.””?
In view of the Tribunal’s decision above, it has now to decide on the allocation of the costs of this

arbitration between the disputing parties.

In a nutshell, while DIBC requests the Tribunal to order that each party bear its own costs of
representation, and that all other costs of arbitration be divided evenly between the parties,
Canada submits that DIBC must bear all the costs of Canada’s legal representation and arbitration

costs.

The Tribunal notes that NAFTA Chapter Eleven contains no provision on the allocation of costs.
Its Article 1135 only provides that “[a] Tribunal may [...] award costs in accordance with the
applicable arbitration rules.” Therefore, the Tribunal’s decision in the matter of costs are to be
found in the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (hereinafter “UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules”),*°

more specifically at Articles 40 to 42 thereof.

Articles 40 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provides the definition of “costs of arbitration”

as follows:

°8 DIBC’s Submission on Costs, May 20, 2015, p. 22; DIBC’s Reply Submission on Costs, May 27, 2015, p. 7.
?° Award on Jurisdiction of April 2, 2015, 4340.

*° Pursuant to item 12 of Procedural Order No. 1, “[t]he applicable arbitration rules are the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules,
pursuant to the Parties’ agreement, except to the extent that they are modified by Section B of Chapter 11 as per
NAFTA Article 1120(2)”.

12

47.

48.

49.

Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules:

1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and, if it

deems appropriate, in another decision.

2. The term “costs” includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to
be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;

(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral
tribunal;

(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses
are approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(e) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the
extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;
(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and expenses of
the Secretary-General of the PCA. (Emphasis added)

The rule governing the power of the arbitrators to decide on costs is set forth in Article 42 of the

UNICITRAL Rules, which provides that:

Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules

1. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or
parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the
parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the
circumstances of the case.

2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in any other
award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to another party as a result
of the decision on allocation of costs. (Emphasis added)

According to such provision, the costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the
unsuccessful party, unless the Tribunal finds it reasonable to allocate such costs in a different
manner. In summary, an arbitral tribunal has near total discretion to allocate the costs of

arbitration pursuant to Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

B. THE LEGAL COSTS

In the case at stake the Tribunal concluded that it has no jurisdiction over any of Claimant’s

claims. Moreover, Claimant was already pursuing its claims against Respondent before State

13

50.

51.

52.

53.

54.

Courts in the United States and Canada and it decided to try another avenue without abandoning
the others. By doing so Claimant chose to take a risk and it shall bear the costs of the strategy it

chose to follow.

The Tribunal sees no reason for deviating from the “cost follow the event” principle established in
Article 42 of the UNICITRAL Rules. However, the Tribunal notes that it did not issue any ruling

on Claimant’s claims associated with the time limitations argument and the merits.

In view of the above, the Tribunal finds that Claimant was partially unsuccessful in this
arbitration and should bear 2/3 of Canada’s reasonable legal costs (as defined in Article 40.2(e) of
the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules) and all the costs of the arbitration (as defined in Article
40.2(a),(b),(c),(d) and (f) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules).

Article 40.2(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that the costs of the arbitration shall include
“the legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the extent that
the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable”. After analyzing the
costs submitted by Canada, ic. CAD 3,015,557.37 (legal costs) + CAD 437,458.58
(disbursements) = CAD 3,453,015.95, the Tribunal considers that Canada’s legal costs are not

reasonable.

Although Canada’s legal costs represent an average fee of CAD 200 per hour (or approx. USD
163), which seems reasonable, the time spent on the case, i.e. approx. 1,500 hours per year, does
not seem so. The number of people working on the case seems exaggerated. For instance, in the
year 2011-2012, when the Notice of Arbitration was submitted and no submission was made by
Canada, Canada had 8 lawyers working on the case (see p. 15 of Canada’s Submission on Costs).
In the circumstances, the Tribunal decides to reduce Canada’s legal costs by 1/3 (which totals
CAD 2,010,371.58), so that the 2/3 of Canada’s reasonable legal costs to be reimbursed by
Claimant amount to CAD 1,340,247.72. This amount, added to Canada’s disbursements (CAD
437,458.58) totals CAD 1,777,706.30.

 

C. THE COSTS OF THE ARBITRATION

With respect to the costs of arbitration, as defined in Articles 40.2(a)(b)(c)(d) and (f) of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Parties deposited a total of USD 320,000 (USD 160,000 by

each of the disputing parties) with the PCA to cover the fees and expenses of the arbitral tribunal.

Total USD 267,681.79

 

 

 

 

Pursuant to item 1 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Secretariat of the Permanent Court of
Arbitration (“PCA”) was designated to act as Registry in this arbitration. The PCA’s fees for

registry services amount to USD 3,206.88.

Pursuant to item 2 of Procedural Order No. 1, Ms. Ana Paula Montans was designated as

Assistant to the Presiding Arbitrator. Ms. Montans’ fees and expenses amount to USD 29,783.33.

Based on the above figures, the arbitration costs, comprising the items covered in Article

40.2(a)(b)(c)(d) and (f) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, total USD 300,672.00.

In light of the Tribunal’s decision in paragraph 51 above, Claimant shall bear all the costs of the
arbitration in the amount of USD 300,672.00 and shall reimburse Respondent the amount paid to
the PCA as deposit in the amount of USD 150,336.00 (i.e. USD 160,000.00 deposited by
Respondent - USD 9,664.00 which shall be reimbursed to Respondent by the PCA as indicated

below).

Considering that the remaining deposit with the PCA totals USD 19,328.00, the PCA shall
reimburse the amount of USD 9,664.00 to each side in accordance with Article 43(5) of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

1. HOLDING

61. In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal decides that:

(a) Claimant shall bear 2/3 of Canada’s reasonable legal costs and expenses in this
arbitration and shall consequently reimburse Respondent the total of
CAD 1,777,706,30;

(b) Claimant shall bear all the costs of the proceedings, and shall consequently
reimburse Canada the deposit it made to the PCA in the amount of
USD 150,336.00;

 

(c) The PCA shall reimburse USD 9,664.00 to each Party in respect to the
unexpended balance of the deposit.
