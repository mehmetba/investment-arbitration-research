B. Ecuapor's OIL INDUSTRY: THE PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACT MODEL

This Section summarizes the facts of this dispute insofar as they bear relevance to rule
on Respondent's purported liability under the Treaty between the United States and
Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment" (the
"Treaty" or "BIT").

This dispute arose in the wake of the oil price spike that began in 2002 and that,
though with some intermittence, continues to this date. The Parties are in dispute as to
how the economic benefits of this oil price spike must be distributed between them. At
the heart of this dispute lie the production sharing contracts ("PSCs") for Blocks 7 and
21, entered into between a Burlington wholly-owned subsidiary and Ecuador. Before

entering into the specifics of the dispute, a review of the recent history of Ecuador's
hydrocarbons industry is warranted to place the dispute in proper context.

Along its history, Ecuador has adopted different contract models for the exploration and
exploitation of its hydrocarbon resources. In the 1980s, the prevalent contract model
for the exploitation of hydrocarbons in Ecuador was the so-called service contract.
Under the service contract model, the government remained the sole owner of any oil
produced in the exploration area (the "Block") awarded to the private contractor. If the
contractor discovered oil reserves, it had the right to a reimbursement of its costs and
to a fee. If it found no oil reserves within a four-year period, the contractor lost its
exploration investment and the contract was terminated. '

The service contract model appeared ill-suited to meet the interests of the State or the
investors alike. The State often incurred losses on oil-producing blocks operated under
service contract models, in part because the contractor's costs frequently spiraled out
of control and the State was contractually bound to reimburse the full measure of these
costs. The model was thus unfit to curb cost inefficiencies.* On the other hand,
investors showed little interest in the service contract model, in part because the profit
margins under this model, albeit steady, were fixed. Investors seemingly preferred to
shoulder part of the exploration and exploitation risk in exchange for a share of the oil
produced. Tellingly, no service contract was executed in the five-year period between
1989-1993. In a nutshell, with the service contract model, Ecuador's hydrocarbons
industry remained stagnant.

Beginning in 1992, the newly-elected Ecuadorian President Duran Ballén set out to
impart new vigor to the sluggish national oil industry. To bring that goal to fruition, the
legal regime applicable to hydrocarbons was overhauled. In October 1993, in the
context of a general program of economic reforms designed to increase the role of the
private sector, President Duran Ballén submitted a bill to Congress calling for the
adoption of a new contract model for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons:
the so-called production-sharing contract (or "PSC"). Under this contract model, the
contractor would assume the entire risk of oil exploration and exploitation, and would in
exchange receive a share of the oil produced in accordance with the allocation
formulas specified in each contract.

Mem., 94 50, 62.
Tr. 590:15-591:10.

The new PSC model was expected to redress the problems that emerged under the
service contract model. It would shift the exploration and exploitation risks from the
State to the contractor and would thus put an end to the problem of excessive and
inefficient costs incurred at the State's expense. In the letter to the Ecuadorian
National Congress (the "Ecuadorian Congress") enclosing the bill, President Duran
Ballén observed that:

"[T]he limited financial resources that the country has [...] do not

justify PetroEcuador’s assumption of all the risk involved in exploration

activities; such risk must be shared with international petroleum

companies. [...] [T]he stipulation for mandatory reimbursement of the

contractor's investments, costs and expenditures has significantly

reduced the participation of the State in the economic benefits of oil

exploration and production in medium and small fields."*
In addition, the new PSC would help to attract foreign investment. In the letter to the
Ecuadorian Congress, President Duran Ballén noted that "the current [service contract
model] has exhausted its possibilities of attracting foreign capital."° One of the reasons
why the service contract model failed to attract foreign investment was that it did not
allow contractors to receive a share of the oil production. In the words of President

Duran Ballén:

"[T]he service contract does not permit the contracting company to
have a production flow of its own. This characteristic goes against the
interest and raison d’étre of international petroleum companies, for the
majority of whom the availability of production is an essential aspect of
marketing in international markets. [...] The new contract [...] will allow
Ecuador to position itself at an internationally competitive level for
attracting venture capital [...]."°

The overall purpose of the proposed shift from service contracts to PSCs was, in sum,
to increase Ecuador's competitiveness in the global oil industry. On 29 November
1993, the Ecuadorian Congress approved the bill authorizing the State to enter into
PSCs with private companies. In passing this amendment to the Hydrocarbons Law,
the Ecuadorian Congress underlined that it was "indispensable to introduce in the
Ecuadorian legislature contractual models that make the exploration and exploitation of

hydrocarbons competitive."”

In conjunction with this amendment, Ecuador issued
Decree 1417 which regulated in detail various aspects of the Hydrocarbons Law
(collectively, the Law and the Decree will be referred to in this award as the

“Hydrocarbons Legal Framework").

Subsequently, Ecuador opened international bidding rounds aimed at concluding PSCs
with private companies. The purpose of this bidding process was to "promote foreign
investment in the Country and expand the hydrocarbons reserves."® On 20 March
1995, Ecuador awarded the production sharing contract for the exploration and
exploitation of Block 21 to foreign investors.° Furthermore, on 23 March 2000, Ecuador
converted the existing service contract for the exploration and exploitation of Block 7

into a production sharing contract.’

C. BURLINGTON'S INTERESTS IN THE PSCs FOR BLOCKS 7 AND 21

Beginning in mid-2001, Burlington acquired interests in the PSCs executed by the
Ecuadorian State for the exploration and exploitation of Blocks 7 and 21. Burlington
acquired these interests through its wholly-owned subsidiary Burlington Oriente (or the
“Burlington subsidiary"). Burlington also acquired interests in the PSCs for Blocks 23
and 24. While Burlington originally asserted claims against Ecuador in relation to
Blocks 23 and 24, which were not yet in production, the Parties have since settled
these claims. Therefore, this decision is confined to Burlington's outstanding claims in
relation to Blocks 7 and 21, which were in production at the time this dispute arose.

Burlington is the minority partner of Blocks 7 and 21. The Blocks are located in the
Ecuadorian Amazon Region, and each covers an area of 200,000 hectares. Burlington
holds a 42.5% interest in the PSC for Block 7"', and a 46.25% interest in the PSC for
Block 21."? The majority partner and operator of the Blocks, the French oil company
Perenco, holds the remaining interests in the Blocks. Under an Ecuadorian tax
regulation issued on 23 September 2005, partners in PSCs for the exploration and
exploitation of hydrocarbons must form a consortium for the joint payment of taxes. In
accordance with this regulation, Burlington Oriente and Perenco established a
consortium in late 2005, which became effective on 1 January 2006 (the "Tax
Consortium" or simply the "Consortium").

The PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 regulated at length the parties’ rights and obligations in
relation to the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in the Blocks. The PSC for

With respect to Block 7, Burlington Oriente acquired a 25% interest on 25 September 2001, a
5% interest on 13 December 2001, and a 12.5% interest in September 2006. Each of these
transactions was followed by the requisite government approvals and registrations.

With respect to Block 21, Burlington Oriente acquired a 32.5% interest in September 2001, a
5% interest on 7 December 2011, and a 8.75% interest on 7 September 2005. Each of these
transactions was followed by the requisite government approvals and registrations.

Block 7 was set to expire in 2010; the PSC for Block 21 in 2021. In particular, the
PSCs (i) contained participation formulas allocating the oil produced between the State
and the contractors, (ii) included choice of law provisions in favor of Ecuadorian law
and, (iii) of pivotal importance to this case, incorporated certain tax clauses whose
meaning is considerably disputed by the Parties.

First, the PSCs contained participation formulas allocating the oil produced between
Ecuador, on the one hand, and the contractors (Burlington and Perenco), on the other.
The PSCs allocated oil production on the basis of the volumes of oil produced, with a
possible upward or downward adjustment based on the quality of the oil.'? The Parties
vigorously disagree over whether these participation formulas were also linked to the
price of oil at the time the PSCs were concluded. Burlington submits that the
participation formulas were grounded solely on the volume and quality of oil produced.
Ecuador, on the other hand, claims that the participation formulas were also premised
on the price of oil at the time of the PSCs, which would yield a specific internal rate of
return ("IRR") for the contractor.

The PSC for Block 7 established the following participation formula:

 

 

 

 

 

Block 7"
Daily average production per Contractor’s
year (barrels) Participation
< 5,000 16.2%
5,000 — 10,000 74.2%
> 10,000 65%

 

 

The PSC for Block 21 stipulated the following participation formula:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Block 21°
Daily average production per Contractor’s
year (barrels) Participation
< 30,000 67.5%
30,000 — 60,000 60%
> 60,000 60%

 

Second, the PSCs included choice of law provisions in favor of Ecuadorian law. The
Parties are in dispute as to whether or not these provisions are legal stabilization

clauses, i.e. clauses whereby the contract is governed by the laws in force at the time
of its execution, as opposed to laws as subsequently modified. Clause 22.1 of the
PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 provide that:

"Applicable Legislation: This Contract is governed exclusively by
Ecuadorian legislation, and laws in force at the time of its
signature are understood to be incorporated by reference.""®
(emphasis added)

Third, the PSCs incorporated tax clauses regulating the tax treatment that would be
afforded to the contractor. Thus, the PSCs stipulated an employment contribution of
15%, an income tax of 25%'’, and exempted the contractor from the payment of
royalties or other additional fees. Moreover, the PSCs contained tax modification
clauses, that is, clauses calling for the application of a "correction factor" whenever tax
changes — be it tax increases or decreases — had an impact on the economy of the
contract. The Parties strongly disagree about the import of these clauses: for
Burlington, these are tax stabilization clauses; for Ecuador, these are merely
renegotiation clauses. Until it has reached a conclusion about their nature, the Tribunal
will refer to these clauses as the "tax modification clauses", for it is undisputed that they
regulate the parties’ conduct in the event of a modification to the tax system. The tax
modification clause of the PSC for Block 7 provides:

"Modification to the tax system: In the event of a modification to the
tax system or the creation or elimination of new taxes not foreseen in
this Contract or of the employment contribution, in force at the time of
the execution of this Contract and as set out in this Clause, which
have an impact on the economy of this Contract, a correction factor
will be included in the production sharing percentages to absorb the
impact of the increase or decrease in the tax or in the employment
contribution burden. This correction factor will be calculated between
the Parties and will be subject to the procedure set forth in Article
thirty-one (31) of the Regulations for Application of the Law Reforming
the Hydrocarbons Law." ®

For its part, the tax modification clause of the PSC for Block 21 states:

"Modification to the tax system and to the employment contribution: In
the event of a modification to the tax system, the employment
contribution or its interpretation, which have an impact on the
economics of this Contract, a correction factor will be included in the
production sharing percentages to absorb the increase or decrease in

Exhs. C-1 and C-2 at clause 22.1.

The combined tax burden of the employment contribution (15%) and the income tax (25%) is
36.25% and not 40% (Exh. C-1, at 11.2.4; Exh. C-2, at 11.2.2). This is because the
employment contribution applies to the gross profits, but the income tax applies only to the
lower amount that results following the application of the employment contribution.

the tax. This adjustment will be approved by the Administrative Board
on the basis of a study that the Contractor will present to that effect.""®

D. ORIGIN OF THE DISPUTE: OIL PRICE INCREASES AND ECUADOR'S RESPONSE

As noted above, Burlington initially acquired interests in the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21
in September 2001.”° The crude oil produced in Block 7 is called Oriente crude and it
is a high-quality crude, with a gravity ranging between 26°-29° API?"; the crude oil
produced in Block 21 is known as Napo crude and is of somewhat lower quality, with a
gravity oscillating between 17°-19° API. Thus, the market price of Oriente crude is
higher than the market price of Napo crude. In September 2001, when Burlington
acquired its initial interests in the PSCs for the Blocks, the price of Oriente crude was
USD 20.15 per barrel.” Block 21 was not in production at that time, and would not be
in production until late 2003.”°

Beginning in 2002, oil prices began to rise. In 2005, the price of a barrel of oil had
more than doubled, exceeding USD 50/bbl for Oriente crude between August and
October 2005. By 2006, the price of Oriente crude reached over USD 60/bbl, and
Napo crude went over USD 50/bbl. Towards the end of 2007, Oriente crude was
trading at around USD 80/bbl and Napo crude at around USD 74/bbl. By 2008, the
price of oil surpassed the USD 100/bbl landmark for both Oriente and Napo crude from
May to July, reaching USD 121.66/bbl for Oriente crude in June 2008” — that is, more
than USD 100/bbl above its September 2001 price. Thereafter, oil prices fell sharply to
below USD 30/bbl at the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009, only to increase again
and stabilize in the range of USD 60-70/bbI for most of 2009 and 2010.°

The Parties disagree on whether the increase in oil prices was foreseeable or not.
Burlington argues that the parties foresaw the possibility that oil prices would increase.
Moreover, as illustrated in the graph below’, in the late 1970s oil prices had
experienced the same type of increase as in 2008.

Ecuador has noted that the graph fails to specify what kind of oil it refers to: "[T]here are
different kinds of crude oils with different prices. The Ecuadorian crude oil has one price, the
WTI has another, the Brent crude oil has another price." (Tr. 619:11-19; also RPHB, 39). WTI
stands for West Texan Intermediate. (Martinez, Oil Prices tab). The WTI is an international
benchmark for oil prices. Ecuadorian crude oil prices are lower than WTI prices (RCM, § 176
n.113) but nonetheless "follow the evolution of WTI" (Davalos, Tr. 620:5-10). Counsel for
Burlington assumed that the graph referred to WTI prices (Tr. 620:11-17).

Ecuador, on the other hand, maintains that the increase in oil prices was "completely
unforeseen and unforeseeable."*” Oil prices remained stable from the mid-1980s to
the beginning of the 2000s. Ecuador claims that the oil price increases of the 1970s
were brought about by specific events, to wit, "the Arab world's tightening of oil
production"® following the Yom Kippur War, and the Iranian revolution together with
the Iran-Iraq war.”° The graph below illustrates how oil price forecasts evolved from
2002 to 2005.°°

According to Ecuador, this price increase "destroyed the economic stability" of the
PSCs, including the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21.°' More generally, Ecuador believed
that the allocation of oil production under the PSCs was no longer fair in view of the
remarkable increase in oil prices. It considered that, because the State is the owner of
the oil, it should benefit from the increase in oil prices to a greater extent than the
contractor; however, under the terms of the PSCs, which allocated the majority of oil
production to the contractor, the contractor would benefit from the increase in oil prices
to a greater extent than the State.*

In November 2005, at a time when the prices of Oriente and Napo crude were about
USD 40/bbl, Ecuador invited Burlington to renegotiate the terms of the PSCs. Ecuador

wished to increase its share of participation from around 22% to 50%.°* Burlington,
however, rejected this proposal.** According to Burlington, the allocation of oil
production was independent of the price of oil. In addition, while the PSCs could be
amended under certain circumstances, these circumstances did not "include a change
in oil prices or the perceived inequity of the production participations to which the
parties agreed."*> As a result, Ecuador's proposed renegotiations failed.

On 1 March 2006, following the breakdown of the renegotiations, Ecuadorian President
Palacio submitted a bill to Congress proposing an additional participation for the State
of "at least 50%"** on so-called extraordinary profits, i.e. profits resulting from oil prices
in excess of the price of oil as it stood when the PSCs were executed. In the letter
explaining the purposes of the bill, President Palacio stated that the PSCs "breach the
principle of equity" insofar as there is no clause that allows for a modification of the oil
participation share in favor of the State in case of an increase in oil prices.°” The
overall purpose of the bill was "to restore equity" in favor of the State. In the
meantime, ConocoPhillips acquired Burlington on 31 March 2006.°°

On 19 April 2006, Congress approved President Palacio's bill and enacted Law 42,
which amended the Hydrocarbons Law as follows:

"Participation of the State over non agreed or unforeseen
surpluses from oil selling contracts. Contracting
companies having Hydrocarbons exploration and exploitation
participation agreements in force with the Ecuadorian State
pursuant to this Law, without prejudice to the volume of crude oil
which may correspond thereto according to their participation, in
the event the actual monthly average selling price for the FOB
sale of Ecuadorian crude oil exceeds the monthly average selling
price in force at the date of execution of the agreement
expressed at constant rates for the month of payment, shall
grant the Ecuadorian State a participation of at least 50%

According to Ecuador, this was a very important event because ConocoPhillips "knew about the
negotiation of the contracts. They knew that Ecuador wanted to do that [renegotiate the PSCs].
They bought Burlington. They knew that Windfall Profits Taxes could be enacted. They had the
China experience. And they also knew that Law 42 could be enacted. Why? Because President
Palacio had already submitted the draft law, the bill, to Congress on the 1° of March 2006." (Tr.

over the extraordinary revenues caused by such price

difference [...]."“° (emphasis added).
As the Tribunal previously concluded, Law 42 is a tax measure for purposes of this
Treaty dispute.“’ While Ecuador has argued that Law 42 is a "levy" rather than a "tax"
under its domestic law, it has conceded that "for the purposes of the present case, any
dispute as to the legal nature of Law 42 under Ecuadorian law is irrelevant."*? Any
such dispute would be irrelevant because the Parties agree that, be it a tax or a levy,
Law 42 is part of Ecuador's "tax system" within the meaning of the PSCs and its tax
modification clauses.** Therefore, for purposes of this decision, the Tribunal deems
that Law 42 created a tax.

Under the Law 42 tax, oil companies had to pay 50% of the amount, if any, by which
the market price of oil exceeds the price of oil at the time the PSCs were executed.“
In order to calculate the tax, it is necessary to determine:

(i) First, the current market price of oil, defined as the actual
monthly average oil spot prices (the "market price");

(ii) Second, the market price of oil at the time the PSCs were
executed adjusted for inflation (the "statutory reference price");

(iii) Third, the tax which is equivalent to 50% of the difference, if

any, between the market price and the statutory reference price.
The statutory reference price was about USD 25/bbI*° for Block 7 and USD 15/bbI** for
Block 21. This statutory reference price was adjusted for inflation and crude quality.*”
In July 2006, for instance, the market price of Oriente crude from Block 7 was USD
66.56/bbI and the adjusted statutory reference price was USD 30.01/bbl. Therefore,
the Law 42 tax was USD 18.28 per barrel of oil produced in Block 7 (50% of the
difference between USD 66.56/bbl and USD 30.01/bbl).“® The market price of Napo

The Law 42 tax applies to the oil company's gross income. Once other taxes and levies
envisaged in the PSCs are deducted from this gross income, the base income is obtained. The
employment contribution and the income tax are then assessed on this base income to
determine the oil company's net income or profits (RCM, § 219).

The exact initial statutory reference price for Block 7 was USD 25.111383 (Mem., § 219; Exh. C-
178)

The exact initial statutory reference price for Block 21 was USD 15.358274 (Mem., § 219; Exh.
C-178).

crude from Block 21 at that time was USD 57.43/bbI“° and the statutory reference price
about USD 18/bbl.®° Accordingly, the Law 42 tax was roughly USD 19.72 per barrel of
oil produced in Block 21 (50% of the difference between USD 57.43/bbl and USD
18/bbl).

On 6 September 2006, the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court declared that Law 42 was
constitutional.°' Burlington paid the Law 42 tax under protest.” By letters dated 18
December 2006, the Tax Consortium requested PetroEcuador to apply a correction
factor that would absorb the effects of Law 42, allegedly in accordance with the tax
modification clauses contained in the PSCs. Ecuador did not reply to these requests,
allegedly on the ground that Burlington had failed to present evidence that Law 42 had
an impact on the economy of the PSCs — an essential prerequisite for the application of
the tax modification clauses.

In November 2006, Rafael Correa won the presidential elections, taking office in
January 2007 and replacing President Palacio. On 18 October 2007, Ecuador issued
Decree 662, which increased the Law 42 tax rate from 50% to 99% ("Decree 662" or
“Law 42 at 99%"). In November 2007, for instance, the market price for Oriente crude
from Block 7 was USD 83.20/bbl and the statutory reference price was USD 30.85/bbl.
Thus, the Law 42 at 99% tax was USD 51.83/bbl (99% of the difference between USD
83.20/bbl and USD 30.85/bbl).** In that month, the market price of Napo crude was
USD 79.09/bbI® and the statutory reference price of about USD 18/bbl.*° It follows that
the Law 42 at 99% tax was roughly USD 60.48/bbl (99% of the difference between
USD 79.09/bbl and USD 18/bbl).

Burlington paid the Law 42 at 99% tax under protest.®” By letters of 28 November
2007, the Tax Consortium again requested PetroEcuador to apply a correction factor to

As there appears to be no evidence of the adjusted statutory reference price for Block 21 in July
2006, the Tribunal has applied to the Block 21 statutory reference price the same adjustment
rate that was applied to the Block 7 statutory reference price, i.e. 20%. This computation is thus
meant to be approximate and not exact.

its oil participation share that would absorb the effects of Law 42 at 99%, allegedly in
accordance with the tax modification clauses of the PSCs. As was the case with Law
42 at 50%, Ecuador did not respond to these requests, allegedly because Burlington
had failed to prove that Law 42 at 99% had affected the economy of the PSCs and
therefore that the requirements for the application of the tax modification clauses were
met.

In December 2007, Ecuador passed the Ley de Equidad Tributaria ("LET"), whose

purported goal was to open a "new avenue for negotiations with the oil companies"

which would allow "them to avoid the application of Law 42"°° at 99%. According to
Ecuador, the LET allowed the State and the oil companies to agree "fairer terms"® for
the allocation of oil revenues. The LET presented the following three differences with
respect to Law 42 at 99%: (i) its tax rate was 70%; (ii) the statutory reference price was
not fixed by Ecuador but was subject to negotiation on a case-by-case basis; and (iii) it
would apply only to those oil companies that agreed to enter into so-called "transitory
agreements" — in the absence of such agreements, Law 42 would continue to apply.

On 26 January 2008, in the wake of the enactment of Law 42 at 99% and the LET,
President Rafael Correa gave a public radio address where he declared that oil
companies had the following three options:

"We are renegotiating the oil contracts. Oil companies have three
options:

[1] either they comply with the 99-1 Decree, that is, of the
extraordinary profits, extraordinary! [...] Out of the extraordinary gains:
99 percent for the state and 1 percent for the company because the
resource is ours. If they disagree, that’s the first option, perfect.

[2] We can renegotiate the contract into a services contract which
always should have been the preponderant model in the oil industry.
Why? Because if the oil is ours we hire somebody to take our oil out,
right? We pay for the job, $10 for each barrel of oil extracted, but the
rest is for us. So, that’s the contract to which we want to go, which
was in force at the beginning of the’90s [...]. What does "participation
contract" mean? They exploit 100 barrels, they take out 100 barrels of
our oil, the private and transnational oil companies, and they give us a
little piece and the rest they take away [...]. And there are people who
defend this. How shameful. They want to take us back into that
opprobrious past, when they took away with no shame the resources
of our country. This revolutionary, patriot and citizen government is
renegotiating oil contracts and we want to go to such special service

contracts, that's how they are called, where we pay $10 per each
barrel of oil, whatever they consider appropriate...negotiating
obviously, but the rest is for us, the owner of the resource. So that's
the second option.

[3] And the third option: If they are not happy, no problem. We don’t
want to rip-off anybody here. How much have they spent in
investments? $200 million? Here, have your $200 million and have a
nice day, and PetroEcuador will exploit that field. But we will not allow!

My compatriots, for them to keep taking away our oil. [...] We have to
put a limit: 45 days, or if not, they have to continue to comply with the
99-1."

Spurred on by the LET and the new government policy, PetroEcuador, on behalf of
Ecuador, and Perenco, on behalf of the Consortium, began renegotiations to reallocate
oil revenues following the increase in oil prices, though this time against the
background of Law 42 at 99%. In March 2008, PetroEcuador and Perenco reached a
preliminary agreement to reallocate oil revenues from Blocks 7 and 21. The March
2008 Transitory Agreement provided that: (a) the Blocks would be operated under the
PSC model for a period of five years and then would be migrated to another contract
model (presumably service contracts); (b) the contract, whatever its modality, would be
extended until 2018; (c) the State's oil participation share would be increased for the
period 2008-2010, and then would be linked to oil prices for the period 2010-2018; (d)
finally, the Law 42 statutory reference price would be increased to USD 42.5/bbl.™

Burlington complains that it was excluded from these negotiations because Ecuador
requested to negotiate exclusively with Perenco. At the hearing, Alex Martinez, the
Manager of Latin American Operations for ConocoPhillips and member of the Board of
Directors of Burlington Oriente™, testified that "the [PetroEcuador] negotiation team
wants only the operator at the table, and they only want one person — one voice at the
table. They don't want Burlington at the table, and they don't want Burlington to talk."®
Burlington argues, however, that although Perenco was the operator of the Block, it
could not by itself renegotiate Burlington's rights under the PSCs.°°

According to Ecuador, on the other hand, Burlington has wrongly sought to create the
impression that it was left out of the negotiation table and that Perenco failed to apprise
it of the status of the negotiations. Ecuador claims that, by virtue of the Joint

"67 In addition, whether

negotiations with the State on behalf of the Consortium.
Perenco apprised Burlington or not of the progress on the contract renegotiations was

an internal matter for the Block partners to which Ecuador was alien.®

At any rate, in April 2008, when Burlington was still "in the midst of evaluating"® the
terms of the March 2008 Transitory Agreement, Ecuador adopted a new "single

model"”°

policy with respect to the renegotiation of oil contracts. Under this new policy,
all transitory agreements, including the March 2008 Transitory Agreement, would only
be valid for a year, after which the parties would have to migrate to a service contract.
In a public radio address delivered in mid-April, President Correa explained the

rationale for this new policy and, referring back to his January public address, stated:

“| said 45 days, | think in January, for the renegotiation of the [oil]
contracts... We were close to a deal, but | stopped it, because even
though we've secured major benefits, | think that we can do better.

[el

| believe that one of the best alternatives is to reach a transitory
agreement, removing a series of absurd clauses from the current
contracts, by which we practically surrendered our national
sovereignty. It wasn't business being subjected to the country's
sovereignty, but rather the country's sovereignty being subjected to
business, [which] we cannot admit [...].

So it seems that the best alternative is to sign a transitory agreement

until there is a new Constitution, and move toward a single contractual

model for all of the [oil] companies. Basically, what was being done

was to modify existing contracts, and we've improved a lot, but we

think it_is better to move toward this definitive solution of a "single

model"”' (emphasis added).
As Ecuador itself acknowledged, the decision to migrate to service contracts within a
year "suspended the negotiations with all oil companies, including Perenco and
Burlington, for a few weeks." This decision would have even broader consequences
in the case of Burlington, which filed a Request for Arbitration within days of President
Correa's announcement of the new "single model" policy.”* According to Burlington, the
decision to migrate to service contracts "meant that Ecuador would reap the benefits of

Burlington's substantial investment in and development of the Blocks, and at the same
time would be the sole beneficiary of then-existing high oil prices and any future oil
price increases."”*

Negotiations were resumed in May 2008. Consistent with President Correa's
announcement, Ecuador submitted to Burlington a new draft Transitory Agreement by
virtue of which (a) the Parties would make their "best efforts" to migrate to a service
contract within 120 days’, (b) Burlington would maintain the levels of investment
initially proposed for 20087°, and (c) it would suspend the ICSID proceedings against
Ecuador.”” Burlington did not accept the terms of this May 2008 Transitory
Agreement.”®

On 10 July 2008, Ecuador proposed still another draft Transitory Agreement whereby
Perenco and Burlington would undertake to migrate to a service contract within one
year of its execution.” In a joint letter dated 16 July 2008, Burlington and Perenco
replied that the terms of this new draft Transitory Agreement, which were "substantially
similar"® to those of the May 2008 Transitory Agreement, were "unacceptable."*' On
20 August 2008, Roy Lyons, Burlington's Vice-President, wrote to Galo Chiriboga,
Minister of Mines and Oil, to inform that Burlington "would prefer to proceed with the
divestment of its assets in Ecuador, rather than migrating its current Production
Sharing Contracts positions into the model of a Services Contract."

According to Ecuador, from that point on, Burlington blocked every attempt to
renegotiate the terms of the PSCs. Since Burlington's consent was indispensable for
renegotiating the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21, this effectively forestalled an agreement
between Ecuador and Perenco.®* In October 2008, Ecuador and Perenco
recommenced negotiations and reached a preliminary agreement with respect to both
Blocks 7 and 21. Perenco “agreed to the principle of migrating to a services

contract"™, a higher statutory reference price (USD 42.5/bbl for Block 7 and USD
48/bbl for Block 21), and the application of the LET tax rate (70%) instead of Law 42 at
99%. The agreement also required the investor to commit to make a USD 110 million
investment and to back up that commitment with a parent company guarantee. ®®

Perenco was "keen"®° to have its minority partner in the Blocks sign these preliminary
agreements (the "November 2008 Transitory Agreements"). Accordingly, in early
November, Perenco provided Burlington with copies of the November 2008 Transitory
Agreements®’ and, on 27 November 2008, Perenco wrote to Burlington:

"In the continued spirit of keeping you apprised of developments
between Perenco and the Government of Ecuador, | write to inform
you that after extensive negotiations we have a draft transitory
agreement that is acceptable to both Perenco on the one hand, and
the Government of Ecuador and PetroEcuador on the other [...].
Perenco believes that the attached agreement is the best present
alternative regarding Blocks 7 and 21.

The transitory agreement cannot become effective as to the
consortium without Burlington's participation in it. We invite you to
consider joining this agreement. If Burlington refuses to do so, there
may be adverse consequences for both our companies and Perenco
will be compelled to explore all possible means of preserving the value
of its investments."**

Burlington, however, stated that it would "not sign the draft transitory agreements"
because it was not "interested in replacing the PSCs with Service Contracts."®° By
letter dated 22 December 2008, Burlington replied to Perenco as follows:

"Our clear position has been and continues to be that Law 42 is
unlawful and that we are entitled to recover all payments made to
Ecuador in connection with Law 42 [...]. Similarly, as we look to the
future, we expect to enjoy the benefits of the economics promised to
us under the PSCs and the BITs [...]. As a result, we see no point in
comparing the economics of the Transitory Agreement to the
economics in place after Law 42 was initially implemented. The
evaluation we have made, for our purposes, is how this agreement
compares to the contracts, as written. In our view, it fails that test."2°

On 23 December 2008, Derlis Palacios, Minister of Mines and Oil, invited Perenco, the
operator of the Blocks, to designate a negotiating team to begin the reversion process
of Block 7 — whose PSC was set to expire in August 2010 — and to "terminate ahead of
time and by mutual agreement"®' the PSC for Block 21, as it was not possible to reach

a final agreement due to the "unchanging position of your partner Burlington

Resources. On 7 January 2009, Burlington wrote to Minister Palacios requesting

compensation for what was, in its understanding, the intended cancellation of the PSCs
for Blocks 7 and 21.% On 21 January 2009, Minister Palacios reportedly stated that

negotiations with Burlington and Perenco "are ‘practically impossible" and the PSCs

are "headed toward 'termination’."®*°

In sum, the renegotiation process failed again. According to Ecuador, Burlington's
refusal to accept the terms of the November 2008 Transitory Agreements "only shows
its complete bad faith and lack of true intention to find an amicable solution, agreeable

to both sides." Burlington, on the other hand, argues that "[rlenegotiating in good

"97 (

faith does not imply an obligation to accept any proposal by Ecuador"”’ (emphasis in

original), and that it had valid reasons not to accept Ecuador's offers®; in the
meantime, the terms of the PSCs should have been respected under the pacta sunt
servanda principle.

The Parties disagree on the number of oil companies that agreed to enter into
transitory agreements to migrate from PSCs into service contracts. According to
Ecuador, almost all major oil producers which were invited to negotiate entered into

transitory agreements with Ecuador. Out of a total of twenty-three contracts, fifteen

were migrated to service contract Burlington, by contrast, maintains that most oil

contract (Tr. 952:11-14). In the Spanish transcript, Mr. Pastor Morris appears as testifying that
15 out of 23 contracts were migrated to services contracts (Spanish Tr. 940:4-8), although it
later testified that only 14 out of 23 were so migrated (Spanish Tr. 986:21-987:3). The

companies did not accept the new service contract proposed by Ecuador. Of the
fourteen PSCs in force when Law 42 at 50% was enacted in April 2006, only four were
successfully converted into service contracts; the remaining oil companies either
settled their claims before signing transitory agreements or signed transitory

agreements but no service contracts. ''

E. COACTIVA PROCEEDINGS, INTERVENTION IN THE BLOCKS AND CADUCIDAD DECREES

While the contract renegotiations were ongoing, Burlington continued to pay the Law
42 tax. Burlington paid the Law 42 tax to Ecuador for two consecutive years, from April
2006 to May 2008. In June 2008, however, Burlington stopped paying the Law 42 tax
to Ecuador. By that time, the Tax Consortium, which had paid around USD 400 million
in Law 42 taxes, grew "concerned about the exponential increase in the amounts in
dispute and the lack of a clear path to reach a negotiated solution.""” Therefore, on 19
June 2008, the Tax Consortium wrote to Ecuador to propose that future Law 42
payments be made "into an escrow account, maintained by an independent escrow
agent in a neutral location, pending resolution of our dispute either by settlement or
award."'°S

At the time, Ecuador did not respond to the Tax Consortium's request.‘ At the
hearing, Germanico Pinto, who would simultaneously become Minister of Non-
Renewable Resources and President of the Board of Director of PetroEcuador and
PetroAmazonas for a ten-month stint", testified that no country in the world would
accept the Tax Consortium's proposal.'® In the same vein, former Minister of Mines
and Oil Galo Chiriboga stated that "tax laws in Ecuador, and | think in many parts of the
world, are mandatory", for which reason accepting the Tax Consortium's proposal
would not be "possible anywhere in the world.""””

Having commenced this arbitration and received no answer from Ecuador on its
escrow account proposal, the Tax Consortium decided to make future Law 42
payments into a segregated account. From June 2008 to April 2009, Burlington paid
around USD 150 million into this segregated account located in the United States.
Ecuador referred to this decision as a "blatant and unlawful act of defiance on the

the Consortium's decision to stop paying the Law 42 tax to Ecuador "was creating a
challenging situation.""°° Similarly, Minister Chiriboga testified as follows:

"[C]itizens [..] do not have the power to decide whether they pay a tax
or not. We do have the option to discuss--pay the tax, and discuss
before a court whether this is legal or not, but we cannot accept that
tomorrow a taxpayer will tell an authority "| am not going to pay to the
State. | am going to deposit this money in an account, and whenever
the judge or the court that is hearing the case decides on this, we'll
see what we do."'"°

On 14 February 2009, following the breakdown of the renegotiations, President Correa
stated at a press conference that:

“[T]wo companies, Perenco and Repsol, with which Burlington is also
allied, have wasted our time. When an agreement was near, they
backed out. | believe, | fear, that they thought they were still dealing
with previous administrations. Which, gentlemen, we will not permit

 

[S]ince they have not paid their taxes on extraordinary profits, | have

ordered enforcement actions against Repsol and Perenco, and these

companies can go wherever they like. This country will not pay

attention to extra-regional authorities that attempt to tell us what to do

or not to do.”"""
On 19 February 2009, Ecuador began coactiva proceedings against the Consortium to
enforce outstanding taxes in the amount of USD 327.3 million. In accordance with this
proceeding, the Executory Tribunal of PetroEcuador (the "Executory Tribunal") sent
three coactiva notices to Perenco, the operator of the Blocks, ordering payment of the
overdue tax within three days, failing which assets would be attached. On 3 March
2009, the Executory Tribunal ordered the seizure of the crude production and cargo
from Blocks 7 and 21, appointing a judicial custodian of the crude. This decision was
confirmed on 9 March 2009 by an Ecuadorian judicial court. '"?

On 6 March 2009, upon the application of Burlington Oriente'’’, this Tribunal

Originally one of the claimants in this arbitration, Burlington Oriente ceased to be a party to
these proceedings after the contract claims were withdrawn (DJ, 9 53, 78-80).

engaging in any conduct that aggravates the dispute between the Parties and/or alters
the status quo until it decides on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures or it
reconsiders the present recommendation, whichever is first.""'© Despite this
recommendation, Ecuador held the first auction of seized crude on 15 May 2009, but
no bids were submitted and the seized oil remained unsold.'"®

On 29 June 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 on provisional
measures, wherein it generally ordered that the Parties "refrain from any conduct that
may lead to an aggravation of the dispute."''” In order to carry out this objective, the
Tribunal specifically directed the Parties to "make their best efforts"’'® to open a joint
escrow account into which Law 42 payments would be made, and the Respondents to

"discontinue"'"®

the coactiva proceedings pending against Burlington Oriente.
Procedural Order No. 1 notwithstanding, a second auction was conducted in early July
2009: PetroEcuador, the sole bidder on this occasion, acquired the seized crude at
50% of its market value — as allowed under Ecuadorian law.

At subsequent auctions, PetroEcuador, still the sole bidder, acquired the seized oil in
the first round for about two-thirds of its value — again in conformity with Ecuadorian
law. The Parties present diverging accounts on why PetroEcuador was the sole bidder
at the auctions. Burlington conjectures that "potential bidders were aware that
ownership of the cargoes was in dispute and subject to the provisional measures
rulings of the Burlington and Perenco tribunals.""*! Ecuador retorts that this explanation
is misleading, and that the real reason why there were no bidders other than
PetroEcuador is that the Consortium threatened legal action against any company that
would acquire the seized crude. '

Although Burlington stopped paying the Law 42 tax in June 2008, it was not until
February 2009 that Ecuador took enforcement action. The Parties disagree on the
reasons behind this timing. Burlington claims that this delayed enforcement of the law

is evidence that the coactiva process was nothing but retaliation for its refusal to
surrender its rights under the PSCs during the renegotiation process, which essentially
ended in December 2008. For its part, Ecuador denies this as a complete
mischaracterization of the facts. Ecuador argues that it did not take enforcement action
before because the Law 42 tax was liquidated on an annual basis and also to avoid a
"heavy-handed"'** environment that could have marred the negotiations. '°

The seizures of the Consortium's crude stretched from March to July 2009. All in all, by
the time the last recorded auction was held in April 2010, Ecuador had auctioned
3,960,000 barrels of crude Oriente from Block 7 and 3,640,000 barrels of crude Napo
from Block 21." The following chart'?” summarizes the outcome of eight auction
rounds of the Consortium's crude, covering most of the crude seized from the
Consortium and acquired by PetroEcuador.

On account of the coactiva seizures and auctions, the Consortium decided to cease
operations in the Block. By letter of 13 July 2009, the Consortium informed the Ministry
of Mines and Oil (the "Ministry") that "[u]nder the circumstances, [...] we are left with no
choice but to suspend" operations in Blocks 7 and 21. The Consortium noted that it
planned to “commence suspension of activities at noon July 16", 2009" unless Ecuador

and PetroEcuador "remedy their current breaches and deliver back to the Consortium

the entirety of the seized crude volumes, or pay a cash equivalent market value."'”°

On 15 July 2009, the Consortium sent a new letter to the Ministry detailing a schedule

of the planned suspension.‘

On the same date, the Ministry replied to the
Consortium that this decision was "illegal"'*' and "would cause serious technical and
economic losses to the government of Ecuador."** On 16 July 2009, after the
suspension was scheduled to occur, Ecuador entered the Blocks, without using force,

to ensure their continued operation. '*

On the same day, PetroEcuador passed a
resolution declaring the state of emergency in the Blocks, and authorizing
PetroAmazonas to adopt any measure necessary to guarantee the continuity of
operations.'** Ever since, Ecuador has been in possession of the Blocks. '%°

The Parties differ on how the Consortium's decision to discontinue operations in the
Blocks should be characterized. Burlington refers to this decision as a "suspension" of
operations, because the Consortium could have "resume[d] normal operations in
relatively short order should Ecuador [have] cease[d] its unlawful actions.""*° At the
hearing, Mr. Martinez testified on direct examination that the Consortium had not

contemplated suspending operations prior to the seizures. '*”

Ecuador, on the other
hand, describes the Consortium's decision as an "abandonment" of the Blocks.'** At
the hearing, Mr. Martinez conceded that the suspension could have lasted for the entire

duration of the Perenco and the Burlington arbitrations. '®°

In September 2009, at PetroEcuador's request, the Minister of Non-Renewable Natural
Resources initiated the so-called caducidad process to terminate the PSCs for Blocks 7
and 21. Perenco, on behalf of the Consortium, opposed the initiation of the process,
albeit to no effect: the Minister did not accept the Consortium's objections. "° Thus, on
20 July 2010, one year after Ecuador's entry into the Blocks, the Minister of Non-

On 27 July 2010, one week after the termination of the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21, the
Ecuadorian Congress passed an amendment to the Hydrocarbons Law and Tax Law.
Pursuant to this amendment, all PSCs had to be migrated to service contracts within a
120-day period — i.e. by the end of November 2010; if the PSCs were not migrated
within that time period, they would be unilaterally terminated — albeit through a process
other than caducidad — and the Ministry of Hydrocarbons would at that point "determine

the value and method of payment for each contract.""

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A.

INITIAL PHASE

On 21 April 2008, Burlington and the Burlington Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Initial
Claimants"), filed a Request for Arbitration (the "Request") with the International Centre
for Settlement of Investment Disputes ("ICSID" or the "Centre") against Ecuador and
PetroEcuador (the "Initial Respondents"), enclosing forty-five exhibits.'“* In the
Request, the Initial Claimants asked for the following relief:

"(a) DECLARE that Ecuador has breached:

(i) Article Ill of the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating and/or
taking measures tantamount to expropriation with respect to
Burlington's investments in Ecuador;

(ii) Article Il of the Treaty by failing to treat Burlington's
investments in Ecuador on a basis no less favorable than that
accorded [to] nationals; by failing to accord Burlington's
investments fair and equitable treatment, full protection and
security and treatment no less than that required by
international law; by implementing arbitrary and discriminatory
measures against Burlington’s investments; and by failing to
observe its obligations with regard to Burlington’s investments;
and

(iii) Each of the PSC;

(b) ORDER Ecuador: (i) to pay damages to Burlington for its
breaches of the Treaty in an amount to be determined at a
later stage in these proceedings, including payment of
compound interest at such a rate and for such period as the
Tribunal considers just and appropriate until the effective and
complete payment of the award of damages for the breach of
the Treaty; and/or (ii) to specific performance of its obligations
under the PSCs and pay damages for its breaches of the
PSCs in an amount to be determined at a later stage in the
proceedings, including interest at such a rate as the Tribunal
considers just and appropriate until the complete payment of
all damages for breach of the PSCs.

(c) AWARD such other relief as the Tribunal considers
appropriate; and

(d) ORDER Ecuador and PetroEcuador to pay all of the costs and
expenses of this arbitration, including Burlington’s legal and
expert fees, the fees and expenses of any experts appointed
by the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and
ICSID's other costs.""*

On 25 April 2008, the Centre transmitted a copy of the Request to Ecuador and to
PetroEcuador in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the
Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the "Institution Rules"). On
2 June 2008, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request
pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of other States (the "ICSID Convention" or the
"Convention") and dispatched the Notice of Registration to the Parties, inviting them to
proceed to constitute the arbitral tribunal.

Since the Parties did not agree on a different procedure within the meaning of Rule
2(3) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the "Arbitration
Rules"), the Initial Claimants opted to constitute the arbitral tribunal pursuant to the
formula established in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Under this formula,
“the Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party
and the third, who shall be the president of the Tribunal, appointed by agreement of the
parties."

On 4 August 2008, the Initial Claimants appointed as arbitrator Prof. Francisco Orrego
Vicufa, a Chilean national. On 22 September 2008, the Respondent appointed as
arbitrator Prof. Brigitte Stern, a French national. On 27 October 2008, the Parties
agreed to appoint Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, as President of
the Arbitral Tribunal. All three arbitrators accepted their appointments. In addition, the
Centre selected Mr. Marco Tulio Montafés-Rumayor to serve as Secretary of the
Tribunal. On 18 November 2008, the Arbitral Tribunal (the "Tribunal") was deemed to
be constituted and the proceedings to have begun.

On 20 January 2009, the Tribunal held a first procedural session at the World Bank's
office in Paris. At the first session, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal had been
properly constituted and raised no objection to the appointment of the members of the
Tribunal. Furthermore, the Parties and the Tribunal agreed on a number of procedural
issues. The first session was audio-recorded and transcribed in both English and
Spanish. Minutes of the first session were drafted, signed by the President and the
Secretary of the Tribunal, and transmitted to the Parties on 18 February 2009. Later
that month, the Parties also expressed their consent to the procedural calendar
proposed by the Tribunal.

On 20 February 2009, Burlington Oriente, the subsidiary holding Claimant's ownership
interests in Blocks 7 and 21, filed a Request for Provisional Measures (the "RPM"),

32

73.

74.

together with a request for a temporary restraining order with immediate effect (the
"TRO Request’), asking that the Initial Respondents refrain from (i) enforcing payments
allegedly due under Law 42; (ii) affecting the legal situation or terminating the Block 7
and 21 PSCs; and (iii) engaging in any conduct that may aggravate the dispute
between the Parties. The RPM was accompanied by twelve exhibits "°, thirteen legal

146

exhibits”, and the witness statement of Alex Martinez. On 4 March 2009, Ecuador

filed a Preliminary Reply to Burlington Oriente's RPM, enclosing three exhibits” and
nineteen legal exhibits. '“

On 6 March 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal recommended "that the [Initial] Respondents
refrain from engaging in any conduct that aggravates the dispute between the Parties
and/or alters the status quo until it decides on the Claimants‘ Request for Provisional
Measures or it reconsiders the present recommendation, whichever is first." On 17
March 2009, Ecuador filed a Reply to Burlington Oriente's RPM and a request for
reconsideration of the Tribunal's 6 of March 2009 recommendation, along with five

150

exhibits ®° and seven legal exhibits.'*' Eight days later, Burlington Oriente objected to

Ecuador's request for reconsideration of the Tribunals 6 of March 2009
recommendation. On 27 March 2009, Burlington Oriente filed its Response to

Ecuador's Reply to the RPM, accompanied by eleven exhibits '**

153

and eight legal
exhibits.

On 3 April 2009, the Tribunal denied Ecuador's request for reconsideration of its
6 March 2009 recommendation on the double ground that there were no changed
circumstances that would warrant such reconsideration, and that the hearing on

provisional measures would take place shortly thereafter. On 6 April 2006, Ecuador

154

filed its Rejoinder to Burlington Oriente's RPM, enclosing six exhibits and fifteen

legal exhibits.'°° On 17 April 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal held the hearing on provisional
measures in Washington D.C., at which counsel for the Parties presented oral

arguments and answered questions from the Tribunal. The hearing was transcribed in
English and Spanish and copies of the transcript were distributed to the Parties.

On 29 June 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 on provisional
measures. It ordered the Parties to "refrain from any conduct that may lead to an

aggravation of the dispute."'%

In order to implement this general objective, it
specifically ordered that the Parties "make their best efforts"’®” to open a joint escrow
account into which Law 42 payments would be made, and that the Respondent
"discontinue"'®® the coactiva proceedings then pending against Burlington Oriente. ‘°°

This order replaced the Tribunal's recommendation of 6 March 2009.

On 18 September 2009, the Initial Claimants withdrew their contract claims (the
"Contract Claims") on the alleged ground that Ecuador had physically occupied the
Blocks, bringing "to completion the expropriation that began with the enactment of Law
42."'® Burlington was to continue to pursue its claims under the Treaty (the "Treaty
Claims"). The Initial Claimants wrote:

"In this context, and as announced at the First Session, the Claimants
respectfully inform the Tribunal that the Contract Claimants [the
Burlington Subsidiaries] hereby withdraw their contractual claims,
including those relating to Block 23 and 24, without prejudice, and
confirm that Burlington maintains its claims under the Treaty [the
"Treaty Claims"]"."®

On 22 September 2009, the Initial Respondents denied that it had expropriated Blocks
7 and 21, but agreed to the withdrawal of the Contract Claims provided that the
withdrawal was "with prejudice".'® The Initial Respondents also requested that the
Tribunal withdraw Procedural Order No. 1 because Burlington Oriente had abandoned
operations in Blocks 7 and 21."

On 10 October 2009, the Initial Claimants "accept[ed] that any withdrawal of the
contractual claims should be with prejudice" because they saw "no reason to preserve

agreed that Procedural Order No. 1 be withdrawn as "[m]aintaining the Order would

By the same token, they

therefore serve no purpose.""® Subsequently on 20 October 2009, the Initial
Claimants confirmed that "PetroEcuador is no longer a party to these proceedings"
following the withdrawal of the Contract Claims. "°

On 29 October 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, which reads
in pertinent part as follows:

"1. Provided that the [Initial] Respondents make no objection by 6
November 2009, the Contract Claims will be deemed
withdrawn with prejudice as of that date. Consequently, as of
6 November 2009, PetroEcuador and, subject to the [Initial]
Claimants’ confirmation by 2 November 2009, [the Burlington
Subsidiaries] will cease to be parties to this dispute. As a
result, this arbitration will deal solely with Burlington's Treaty
Claims against Ecuador.

2. Procedural Order No. 1 is hereby revoked. Any funds in the

escrow account are therefore released to the [Initial]

Claimants." [The Tribunal nonetheless "specified that the

Parties remain under a duty not to further aggravate the

dispute").
In accordance with such order, the Initial Claimants confirmed on 2 November 2009
that the Burlington Subsidiaries were no longer parties to these proceedings and that
the Contract Claims were withdrawn. For their part, the Initial Respondents did not
object to the withdrawal with prejudice of the Contract Claims by the specified date.
Accordingly, as of 6 November 2009, the Contract Claims were withdrawn with
prejudice and PetroEcuador and the Burlington Subsidiaries ceased to be parties to
these proceedings. From that time on, this arbitration is confined to Burlington's Treaty
Claims against Ecuador.

B. JURISDICTIONAL PHASE

On 20 April 2009, the Initial Claimants submitted their Memorial, accompanied by one
hundred and twenty exhibits‘®’, one hundred and six legal exhibits'®®, the witness
statements of Taylor Reid and Herb Vickers, and the first supplemental witness

statement of Alex Martinez. In addition, the Initial Claimants submitted complete

English translations.

On 20 May 2009, Ecuador and PetroEcuador announced in separate correspondence
that they would object to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. On 20 July 2009,
Ecuador and PetroEcuador filed separate Objections to Jurisdiction. Ecuador filed its

Objections to Jurisdiction together with ninety-nine exhibits'”,

fourteen legal
exhibits'’’, the witness statement of Dr. Christian Davalos, and the expert reports of

Prof. Juan Pablo Aguilar and Prof. Luis Parraguez Ruiz.

On 20 October 2009, Burlington filed a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, enclosing ten

exhibits‘ 4

and twenty-one legal exhibits. Burlington did not append any witness
statement of expert opinion to its submission. Because the Burlington Subsidiaries
would soon cease to be parties to this arbitration, only Burlington filed a Counter-
Memorial on Jurisdiction. '”°

On 30 October 2009, the Tribunal and the Parties held a pre-hearing telephone
conference to organize the hearing on jurisdiction. Shortly thereafter, the Tribunal
circulated Procedural Order No. 3 addressing a number of procedural issues related to
the impending hearing. The hearing on jurisdiction took place on 22 January 2010 at
the World Bank's offices in Paris. On 2 June 2010, the Arbitral Tribunal dispatched the

Decision on Jurisdiction to the Parties.

In the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal declared that: (i) it had jurisdiction over the
expropriation claim; (ii) it lacked jurisdiction over the fair and equitable treatment claim,
the arbitrary impairment claim, and the full protection and security claim; (iii) it would
join to the merits the issue of whether it had jurisdiction over Burlington's Law 42 first
umbrella clause claim and over the first limb of its third umbrella clause claim; (iv)
Burlington's second umbrella clause claim and the second limb of its third umbrella
clause claim had lapsed on their own terms; and (v) Burlington's full protection and
security claims for Blocks 23 and 24 were inadmissible.'”®

C. LIABILITY PHASE AND COUNTERCLAIMS

From the time Burlington began this arbitration in April 2008, significant new events
took place — most notably, the coactiva proceedings, Ecuador's intervention in the
Blocks, and the termination of the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21. For this reason, the
Parties agreed that Burlington would have the opportunity to file a supplemental
memorial. Thus, on 29 September 2010, Burlington submitted a Supplemental

177

Memorial on Liability, together with fifty-two exhibits'”’, eighteen legal exhibits'”, and

the second supplemental witness statement of Alex Martinez.

On 17 January 2011, Ecuador presented its Counter-Memorial on Liability (the

"Counter-Memorial"), accompanied by seventy exhibits'”,

180

ninety-seven legal
exhibits", and the witness statements of Wilson Pastor, Germanico Pinto, Derlis
Palacios, Galo Chiriboga, Celio Vega, Pablo Luna, the second witness statement of
Christian Davalos, the expert reports of Fair Links, RPS, IEMS, and the second expert
report of Juan Pablo Aguilar. In the Counter-Memorial, Ecuador asserted
counterclaims against Burlington for damage to the environment and the infrastructure

in Blocks 7 and 21."

On 20 January 2011, the Tribunal and the Parties held a telephone conference to
discuss various procedural matters in connection with the forthcoming hearing on
liability. On 28 January 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, deciding
that, while the hearing on liability would be devoted solely to Burlington's claims, the
Tribunal and the Parties would hold a procedural discussion at the end of the hearing
to address Ecuador's counterclaims. The Tribunal also issued directions with respect
to various matters related to the organization of the hearing, and proposed the
appointment of Mr. Gustavo Laborde as assistant to the Tribunal.

On 7 February 2011, the Tribunal circulated Procedural Order No. 5 granting in part
Ecuador's request for document disclosure. On 21 February 2011, Burlington objected
to Ecuador's planned cross-examination of Herb Vickers on the ground that this
examination would exceed the scope of Mr. Vickers' witness statement. On 2 March
2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 allowing Ecuador to cross-examine
Mr. Vickers on limited and specified topics. Furthermore, having received the consent

counterclaims. On 6 May 2011, the Parties simultaneously filed their post-hearing
briefs. On 27 May 2011, Burlington advised the Tribunal that it would raise no
jurisdictional objections in respect of Ecuador's counterclaims, in accordance with an
agreement executed the previous day.

On 21 July 2011, after consulting the Parties, the Tribunal released Procedural Order
No. 8, whereby it established a procedural calendar for Ecuador's counterclaims, and
laid down the procedural rules applicable to these claims. In accordance with this
procedural calendar, on 30 September 2011, Ecuador submitted a Supplemental

‘87 ‘nine legal exhibits’, the

Memorial on Counterclaims, enclosing fifty-one exhibits
witness statements of Diego Montenegro, Marco Puente, Manuel Solis, the second
witness statement of Pablo Luna, the expert report of Prof. Ricardo Crespo Plaza, and

the second expert report of IEMS.

On 13 February 2012, the Claimant wrote to the Centre to inform that the Parties had
reached an agreement to amend the procedural calendar for Ecuador's counterclaims,
subject to the Tribunal's approval. On 15 February, the Tribunal approved the Parties’
amendment to the procedural calendar, subject to Ecuador's approval.

This agreement was entered into between Burlington Resources, Burlington Oriente, and
Burlington Resources International, on the one hand, and Ecuador, on the other hand (see Exh.

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF
A. BURLINGTON'S POSITION

Following the Decision on Jurisdiction, Burlington's case can essentially be
summarized as follows:

(i) | The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Burlington's umbrella
clause claims; with respect to the merits, Ecuador has
failed to observe its obligations, contained both in laws
and regulations and in the PSCs, with respect to
Burlington's investments (the "umbrella clause claim");

(ii) | Ecuador unlawfully expropriated Burlington's investment;
specifically, Ecuador's measures, to wit, (i) Law 42, (ii)
the coactiva process and seizures, (iii) the physical
occupation of Blocks 7 and 21, and (iv) the termination
of the PSCs in the caducidad process, individually and in
the aggregate, effected an unlawful expropriation of
Burlington's investment (the "expropriation claim");

(iii) As a result of the foregoing Treaty breaches, Ecuador
must pay damages to Burlington in an amount to be
determined in the quantum phase of these proceedings.

1. Burlington's Umbrella Clause Claim

Burlington presents claims under the observance of obligations clause of Article II(3)(c)
of the Treaty, i.e. the so-called umbrella clause. Burlington alleges that the Tribunal
has jurisdiction over these claims (1.1) and that Ecuador breached the umbrella clause
by failing to observe its obligations with regard to Burlington's investment (1.2).

1.1. Jurisdiction over the umbrella clause claims

Burlington submits that (i) Ecuador's obligations to Burlington arise not only from the
PSCs but also from its hydrocarbons-related laws and regulations; (ii) that the
withdrawal of the contract claims under the PSCs does not preclude it from pursuing
Treaty claims under the umbrella clause; and (iii) that, for purpose of the umbrella
clause claims based on the PSCs, the Treaty does not require privity of contract
between Burlington and Ecuador.

First, Ecuador's obligations to Burlington are not limited to contractual obligations under
the PSCs, but also encompass the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework. Unilateral
commitments made with respect to a reasonably specific class of investors are within

a

100.

102.

the scope of application of the umbrella clause. Support for this broad construction of
umbrella clauses is to be found in Noble Energy, Continental Casualty, Revere Copper
and Noble Ventures. Investors such as Burlington rely on these unilateral commitments
to plan and make their investments. '®°

Second, Ecuador's argument that there is no underlying contractual obligation that
could be elevated to the Treaty level because of the withdrawal of the contract claims is
flawed. In fact, contract and Treaty claims have "separate lives."'° When Ecuador
breached the PSCs, two separate and independent sets of claims arose; one under the
contracts, another under the Treaty. These sets of claims involve different parties and
different legal sources. Burlington may pursue one set of rights without pursuing the
other. The Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction already confirmed that these two sets of
claims are independent; yet, an undaunted Ecuador reiterates its objections at the
merits phase. '**

Third, the Treaty's umbrella clause does not require privity between Burlington and
Ecuador. This follows from the plain language of the Treaty. The umbrella clause
applies to (i) "any obligation" (ii) that Ecuador "may have entered into with regard to"
(iii) Burlington's "investments." All three elements are met in this case. The PSCs
contain legal obligations. Ecuador has indisputably assumed the obligations contained
in the PSCs, i.e. it has "entered into" these obligations. These obligations have been
entered into "with regard to [Burlington's] investments." This is all the Treaty requires.

The umbrella clause refers to obligations entered into with regard to "investments", not
with regard to "investors." This choice of words is significant. The Contracting Parties
to the Treaty — Ecuador and the United States — could have used a narrower
formulation incorporating a privity element, but instead "deliberately chose the broader

192

term. Additionally, Ecuador's allegation that there is a "series of consistent

cases"'® requiring privity for purposes of the umbrella clause is belied by the decision

in Continental Casualty. Further, a privity component would be contrary to the spirit of

CPHB, §§ 266-278; Tr. 1314:17-1315:16.

CPHB, § 262.
Tr. 151:11-153:21, Tr. 1294:2-1296:16. Counsel for Burlington further added that "Ecuador is
surely estopped as a matter of good faith from alleging that [...] Burlington's treaty claim, which
had been there from the beginning and was quite visibly not being withdrawn, somehow
evaporated" as a result of the subsidiary's withdrawal of the contract claims (Tr. 1294:18-22).

the Treaty, which in accordance with Article | of the Treaty is also to protect indirect

investments. '®*

1.2. Ecuador breached its obligations with regard to Burlington's investments

According to Burlington, Ecuador breached the umbrella clause because it failed to
observe its obligations with respect to Burlington's investment. First, Ecuador failed to
absorb the effects of Law 42 on Burlington. While Ecuador denies being under such
obligation, Burlington argues that its share of oil production was independent of the
price of oil — the rationale behind Law 42 — and that Ecuador was bound to indemnify
Burlington for any tax having an impact on the economy of the PSCs. Second,
Ecuador failed to deliver to Burlington its share of oil production according to the
formulas set out in the PSCs.'®® These breaches are not excused under the principle
rebus sic stantibus'®®, upon which Ecuador denies relying despite referring to the
requirements for its application. '°”

Burlington had the right to receive the upside of any oil price increase.'°* Under the
PSCs, its share of oil production was not dependent on the price of oil. It follows that
Burlington was entitled to receive the full market value of its share of oil production,
subject only to the payment of the taxes and employment contributions specified in the
PSCs. In addition, in the event that a tax had an impact on the economy of the
contract, a correction factor would have to be applied in order to absorb the effect of
that tax. In this case, Law 42 had an impact on the economy of the PSCs, and
Ecuador was therefore under an obligation to absorb its effects. '®°

The rebus sic stantibus principle has no application to this case.” On the one hand,
both the fact of the oil price increase and the magnitude of the increase were
foreseeable. The negotiating history shows that the original parties to the PSC
expressly contemplated the possibility that oil prices could increase, but ultimately

CSM, $9 125-131, 135.

Mem., § 369; CSM, § 123.

A party invoking the rebus sic stantibus principle must show (i) that an extraordinary and
unforeseeable or unforeseen event caused an imbalance in the obligation of the parties; (ii) that
the imbalance is such that performance of the contract would be excessively burdensome for
one of the parties; and (iii) that the event causing the imbalance should not be a consequence
of the actions or omissions of the party invoking the principle (CPHB, {| 203).

Burlington claims that Ecuador refers to the requirements underlying the principle rebus sic
stantibus in its submissions and expert reports (CPHB, § 201).

decided not to include a price adjustment factor." Further, the magnitude of the oil

price increase was not unprecedented, but was actually similar to that of the 1970s.?
On the other hand, the oil price increase did not render Ecuador's performance of the
PSCs more burdensome.”° Thus, Ecuador does not meet the requirements of the

rebus sic stantibus principle.”°*

2. Burlington's Expropriation Claim

Burlington claims that Ecuador has expropriated its investment (2.1) in breach of the
Treaty requirements for expropriation, i.e. unlawfully (2.2).

2.1. Ecuador expropriated Burlington's investment

According to Burlington, Ecuador has deprived Burlington of the use and enjoyment of
its investments by adopting the following measures which, both individually and in the
aggregate, run afoul of Article Ill of the Treaty:

(i) Enactment of Law 42 (at the 50% rate as of April 2006,
and at the 99% rate as of October 2007);

(ii) Seizure and auctioning — at below market prices — of the
Consortium's share of crude oil production through the
coactiva proceedings;

(iii) Physical takeover of Blocks 7 and 21;

(iv) Termination of the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 through the
caducidad process.

2.1.1. Law 42

Burlington claims that the application of Law 42 to its investment was an expropriatory
measure. While Burlington agrees that the power to tax is part of a State's regulatory
power, it observes that the sovereign power to tax might also entail the power to
destroy. As Professor lan Brownlie explained, a tax is unlawful when it has the
"precise object and effect of confiscation." The Treaty itself accepts the possibility
that a tax may be expropriatory; thus, contrary to what Ecuador alleges, tax measures

6

are not entitled to any special deference.*° Accordingly, a tax that substantially

110.

111.

deprives an investor of the value of its investment is expropriatory.2” Whether a tax
results in a substantial deprivation and is thus expropriatory is ultimately a fact-specific
question.2°

Law 42 was "a measure tantamount to expropriation". Its effect was to transfer

virtually all of Burlington's revenues to Ecuador, and to deprive Burlington of practically
all of the profits to which it was entitled under the PSCs. At the 50% rate, Law 42 had
a devastating impact on Burlington's investment: Burlington was unable to recover past
investments and forced to scale back its development plans, and operations in Block

21 became uneconomic.?"°

At the 99% rate, Law 42 had a destructive impact on
Burlington's investment: Burlington operated at a loss in 2008 and ceased to make any
new investment in the Blocks — even in the Oso field where it did make additional

investments with Law 42 at 50%.7"'

In the words of counsel for Burlington, Law 42 at 99% transformed operations in the
Blocks "into a form of subsistence farming, hand-to-mouth, day-to-day operation."*'?
Law 42 at 99% diminished the Consortium's share of total revenues from 38.3% to
9.9% in Block 7, and from 48.6% to 8.3% in Block 21."° In July 2008, for example,
Napo crude had a market price of USD 122 per barrel. Under Law 42 at 99%,
Burlington had to pay a Law 42 tax of over USD 107 per barrel.** Therefore,
according to Burlington, the evidence shows that Law 42 was a measure tantamount to

expropriation both at the 50% and at the 99% rates.

Ecuador claims that under international law a tax is expropriatory only if (i) the State
acts with expropriatory intent, and (ii) the tax is discriminatory. Yet, Burlington counters
that there is no basis in the Treaty for these requirements. In any event, Burlington
meets the requirements of expropriation even under Ecuador's own standard. In fact,
as further elaborated below, the intent behind Law 42 was to deprive Burlington of its
valuable rights under the PSCs. There was also a discriminatory application of the tax
rates, because a lower tax rate of 70% applied to those oil companies who signed
transitory agreements with Ecuador.

Contrary to what Ecuador argues, the purpose of Law 42 was not to restore the
economic equilibrium of the PSCs.*"° Had that been Ecuador's real intention, it would
have conducted an analysis of each individual PSC in order to determine what the
equilibrium point was. No such analysis was conducted. On the contrary, Ecuador
imposed across the board tax rates that applied on a general basis and could thus not
be tailored to the specificities of each individual PSC.?"° In addition, Ecuador imposed
three different tax rates at different points in time — 50, 99 and 70 -, thereby showing
that its intent was not to restore the economic equilibrium of the PSCs.?'”

In actuality, the purpose of Law 42 was to force Burlington to surrender its rights under
the PSCs. President Correa himself characterized Law 42 as a "pressuring
measure"*'® that would prompt oil companies to negotiate with Ecuador.*'° Likewise,
President Correa stated that the oil companies had three options: to pay the Law 42 tax
— at that point at the 99% rate —, to renegotiate the PSC into a service contract, or else
to receive the sunk costs of their investment and leave the country.”° Further
evidence on record supports a similar conclusion. Accordingly, the purpose of Law 42
was to compel Burlington to relinquish its rights under the PSCs, not to restore the
economic equilibrium of the PSCs.

After passing Law 42, Ecuador had a contractual duty to apply the tax stabilization
clauses under the PSCs. Pursuant to these clauses, Ecuador was bound to readjust
Burlington's oil participation share in order to absorb the impact of the tax increase.
However, Ecuador ignored Burlington's requests that its oil participation share be

readjusted. This is consistent with Ecuador's goal of unilaterally changing the

221

economic terms of the PSCs. By ignoring Burlington's request for a readjustment,

Ecuador extinguished Burlington's rights to its participation share under the terms of

the PSCs.””? As a result, Ecuador's enactment of Law 42 and its subsequent refusal to

absorb the effects of this tax effected a taking of Burlington's contract rights.“

Finally, Ecuador wrongly seeks to create the impression that Burlington was an
unreasonable partner. It is not true that Burlington failed to renegotiate the PSCs in
good faith following the surge in oil prices. In reality, Burlington was unable to accept
Ecuador's renegotiation proposals simply because they were unreasonable. These
proposals required Burlington to forgo its rights under the PSCs without even knowing

4,

what it would receive in return.*** In addition, Ecuador's allegation that all other oil

5 In fact, most

companies accepted to renegotiate their contracts is disingenuous.”
initiated arbitration proceedings against Ecuador after Law 42 was passed, and only
four out of the fourteen PSCs in force when Law 42 was enacted were successfully

converted into service contracts.”°

2.1.2. The coactiva process, seizures and auctions

Burlington maintains that the coactiva process, seizures and auctions constituted a
direct and complete taking because they had the effect of destroying the value of its
investment.”’ Ecuador carried out the coactiva process in breach of both the PSCs
and this Tribunal's provisional measures order. Under the PSCs, a share of oil
production had to be allocated to Burlington. Under the Tribunal's provisional
measures order, Ecuador had to discontinue the coactiva process. Notwithstanding
the PSCs and the provisional measures order, Ecuador continued to seize and auction
Burlington's share of oil production.”*

The coactiva process was commenced in retaliation for Burlington's refusal to accept
Ecuador's renegotiation proposals.” In June 2008, the Consortium began making the
disputed Law 42 payments into a segregated account. Ecuador raised no protest to
this course of action for the next eight months.”°° It was only after the renegotiation
process broke down in December 2008 that Ecuador commenced the coactiva
process.**' Ecuador had discretion to decide whether and when to start this process.
Therefore, both the discretionary nature and the timing of the coactiva process show

that it was initiated to retaliate against Burlington's opposition to surrender its rights
under the PSCs.?%*

Burlington submits that the coactiva process was an expropriatory measure.”*? As an
initial matter, Burlington notes that the auction process was a failure because there
were no bidders other than PetroEcuador. This allowed PetroEcuador to acquire the
seized oil at discounts of 33% and 50% below market prices, harming Burlington in the
process as the auctions resulted in reduced offsets of the alleged Law 42 debts.?™
Moreover, by dint of the coactiva process, Burlington was deprived of the right to earn
a revenue, and hence of the economic benefits of its investment.”° All in all, the
coactiva process effected a "complete taking" because it destroyed the value of

Burlington's investment.

2.1.3. The physical takeover of Blocks 7 and 21

Burlington asserts that Ecuador's physical takeover of Blocks 7 and 21 completely
expropriated its investment.’ This physical occupation was the culmination of
Ecuador's chain of expropriatory measures. As a consequence of the coactiva
process, Burlington's investment became uneconomic to the point where the
Consortium had no rational choice other than to suspend operations in the Blocks.?%*
Using as a pretext the alleged risks that this suspension would bring about, Ecuador
physically took over the Blocks. Accordingly, Ecuador's arbitrary takeover of the Blocks
was a complete and direct expropriation of Burlington's investment.

Burlington's decision to suspend operations in Blocks 7 and 21 was justified both from
an economic and a legal standpoint. From an economic standpoint, Burlington could

not reasonably be expected to continue to fund an investment from which it no longer

9

obtained any revenues.”° With the coactiva process, Burlington found itself in a

position where it was liable for the entire costs and risks of oil production, but received

no revenues in exchange.™° In those circumstances, Burlington had no rational course
of action other than to suspend operations and to reduce costs to the minimum.”

From a legal standpoint, Burlington's suspension found justification in the principle of
exceptio non adimpleti contractus, by virtue of which a party to a contract may suspend
performance in the event that the other party is in breach.” Burlington could rely on
this principle as a matter of both Ecuadorian and international law. Under Ecuadorian
law, Burlington could invoke this principle because, contrary to what Ecuador alleges,
hydrocarbons production is not a public service and thus there is no need to guarantee
its continued operation.*“* Under international law, ICSID tribunals have held that an
investor may suspend operations when it would be unreasonable to continue operating
in light of State measures.

Additionally, Ecuador's takeover of the Blocks was not justified because there was no

real risk of damage to the Blocks.”

The risks of damage on which Ecuador has
focused are unsubstantiated and theoretical. They are unsubstantiated because the
RPS study at the root of Ecuador's allegations is based on admittedly incomplete and
partial information.“ They are theoretical because the RPS study draws no
meaningful conclusions as to the likelihood that these risks may actually come to
pass.” As a matter of fact, Burlington's suspension plan was meant to follow a well-
developed protocol, based on the experience of previous suspensions, which would
have mitigated the risks identified in the RPS report.2®

Since there was no proper justification for this measure, Ecuador's physical takeover of
Blocks 7 and 21 was a complete and direct expropriation of Burlington's investment.
The physical takeover of the Blocks was the last of a series of expropriatory measures
prompted by Burlington's refusal to abandon its rights under the PSCs.*"° It culminated
Ecuador's campaign to migrate to a contract model more beneficial to the State in a

period of high oil prices.%° Through this measure, Ecuador took possession of

Burlington's entire investment.?°'

For the foregoing reasons, Ecuador's measures — namely, Law 42, the coactiva
process, and the physical takeover of the Blocks — both individually and cumulatively
expropriated Burlington's investment.

2.1.4. The caducidad process

According to Burlington, the termination of the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 in the context
of the caducidad process was merely "symbolic" because its investment had already
been fully expropriated with the physical occupation of the Blocks.*** With this
measure, Ecuador "foreclosed any possibility of Burlington returning to the legal and
fiscal regime it had been guaranteed prior to Ecuador's expropriation."*** For its part,
Ecuador first submitted that "caducidad is simply not part of this case",** and then
raised jurisdictional and admissibility objections against the Tribunal entertaining
caducidad-related claims. While Burlington has not specifically answered these
submissions, it is apparent from its argumentation that it opposes them.

2.2. Ecuador's expropriation of Burlington's investment was unlawful

Ecuador's expropriation of Burlington's investment was unlawful because it failed to
meet the requirements of Article III(1) of the BIT. First, under the BIT, compensation is
an absolute requirement for a lawful expropriation. An expropriation cannot be lawful
except upon payment of "prompt, adequate and effective compensation."** Therefore,
Ecuador's failure to offer Burlington any compensation for the expropriation renders it
unlawful. Second, Ecuador carried out the expropriation in contravention of the general
principles of treatment articulated in Article II(3) of the Treaty — fair and equitable
treatment, freedom from arbitrary measures and observance of obligations. The
Tribunal has jurisdiction over these principles, which are expressly referred to in Article
1I(1)?°” and are thus part of Burlington's expropriation claim.”**

C. Ecuapor's POSITION

128. Following the Decision on Jurisdiction, Ecuador's case can essentially be summarized
as follows:

(i) The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the (a) umbrella
clause claims, (b) the fair and equitable treatment and
arbitrary impairment claims that Burlington seeks to
reintroduce through the back door, and (c) any claim
related to the caducidad decrees. In addition, any
caducidad claim is inadmissible;

(ii) Law 42 was necessary and appropriate under the
circumstances. In particular, Law 42 did not modify or
breach the PSCs and, at any rate, any alleged contract
breach cannot amount to a Treaty breach;

(iii) Ecuador did not expropriate Burlington's investment in
Blocks 7 and 21, whether (a) through Law 42, (b) the

carried out contrary to the principles articulated in Article II(3) does not depend on a stand-alone
violation of Article II(3) and thus does not contravene this Tribunal's determination that it does
not have jurisdiction under Article X to assess whether tax measures violated Article II(3) of the
Treaty” (/d., at § 106).

coactiva process, or (c) [Ecuador's necessary
intervention following Burlington's abandonment of the
Blocks. At any rate, Ecuador did not unlawfully
expropriate Burlington's investment in Blocks 7 and 21.

1. Burlington Pursues Claims over which the Tribunal has no Jurisdiction

Ecuador objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over Burlington's surviving umbrella
clause claims, over Burlington's fair and equitable treatment and arbitrary impairment

260

claims, which Burlington is seeking to reintroduce "through the back door"*”’, and over

the caducidad decrees. It adds that the caducidad claims are inadmissible.

1.1. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Burlington's surviving umbrella clause
claims
Ecuador objects to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Burlington's surviving umbrella
clause claims because (i) there is no "obligation" that could be elevated to the Treaty
level, and (ii) if par impossible there were any such obligation, Burlington is not privy to
it. The ordinary meaning of "obligation" involves a ratione personae element, a
relationship between an obligee and an obligor, between a creditor and a debtor.”*"

Here there is no obligation that could be elevated to treaty level either in the PSCs or
under the Ecuadorian Hydrocarbons Law ("EHL"). There is none in the PSCs because
the Burlington Subsidiaries withdrew the Contract Claims with prejudice. Therefore,
Burlington has waived the rights underlying these claims and there is thus no
corresponding obligation.” In addition, Burlington may not invoke the EHL to elevate
an "obligation" to treaty level because (i) Ecuador has not "entered into" any obligation
in enacting the EHL, (ii) the EHL is of a general nature, and is not related to any
specific investment, and (iii) at any rate, the EHL imposes no obligation upon
Ecuador.?°

Moreover, if there were nevertheless any "obligations" that could be elevated to treaty
level, Burlington could not rely on them for lack of privity. The principle of privity is

"essential to contractual obligations."*™

An obligation implies an obligor and an
obligee, a creditor and a debtor. In short, privity is part of the ordinary meaning of the
term "“obligation.". The CMS annulment decision, other ICSID decisions, and

commentators confirm this analysis. Burlington simply disregards the ordinary

meaning of "obligation" and focuses on the expression "with regard to investments".
However, this expression is intended to narrow the scope of the umbrella clause, not to
broaden it.

1.2. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Burlington's caducidad claims (if any)
nor over claims in relation to fair and equitable treatment and arbitrary
impairment

Ecuador also objects to the jurisdiction over and admissibility of the caducidad claims.
As a preliminary matter, Ecuador understands that Burlington does not contest the
validity of the caducidad decrees. Indeed, Burlington alleges that these decrees are of
"symbolic" value and that the expropriation would in any event have occurred "well
before" these decrees were issued. However, if Burlington does contest the validity of
the caducidad decrees or the procedure leading up to them, then Ecuador objects to
the jurisdiction over and admissibility of these claims.

The caducidad claims do not fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for several
reasons. Initially, because the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 exclude caducidad from the
scope of their arbitration clauses. In addition, because the PSCs also exclude Treaty
claims from the ratione materiae scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction: that is what the
parties to the PSCs intended, and the PSCs were concluded after the Treaty entered
into force.®° Lastly, the caducidad claims are not admissible because Burlington has
not made a reasonable attempt to pursue redress in relation to these measures before
the Ecuadorian administrative courts.?°”

Finally, Ecuador also objects to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Burlington's already
dismissed fair and equitable treatment and arbitrary impairment claims. Although
Article IlIl(1) of the Treaty refers to Article II(3), Burlington abuses this reference to
surreptitiously put before the Tribunal, once again, its fair and equitable treatment and
arbitrary impairment claims, over which the Tribunal has already held that it lacks
jurisdiction. Thus, Ecuador requests that Section III(B)(2) of Burlington's Supplemental
Memorial on Liability ({{ 102-122) be struck from the record.

2. Ecuador Did not Breach its PSCs' Obligations Towards Burlington
2.1. Law 42 was necessary and appropriate under the circumstances

Contrary to what Burlington alleges, Law 42 was not passed simply to capture a larger
share of the revenues generated by increased oil prices. It was passed in a context
marked by an unexpected and unprecedented increase in oil prices between 2002 and
2008. Neither Burlington nor Ecuador foresaw or could foresee this course of events.
Such unprecedented price increase affected the economic equilibrium of the PSCs,
which are based on the reasonably foreseeable expectations of the parties at the time
of contract negotiations.”

When an unforeseen increase in prices affects the economics of the contract, the
contract must be readjusted, taking into account the widely accepted assumption that
the State, as the owner of the non renewable resource, is to be the main beneficiary of
extra revenues resulting from high oil prices.””° Numerous other countries have acted
just like Ecuador in similar circumstances. In 1980, the United States enacted an Oil
Windfall Profit Tax in response to the oil price spike of the 1970s. And since 2002, no
less than 16 countries, including developed countries such as the United States, the
United Kingdom and Canada, have adopted similar measures. Tellingly,
ConocoPhillips, Burlington's parent company, has been subject to tax adjustments in
the United Kingdom and Norway. Therefore, Burlington's portrayal of Ecuador as a
"renegade State" is misguided.”

The PSCs were predicated upon economic models prepared by Engineer Celio Vega,
Member of the Board of Directors of PetroEcuador and Financial Head of the
Petroleum Contract Administration Unit.?”* These models are mathematical formulas
that take into account the economic variables of the contract at the time of contracting,
such as the risk assumed by the investor and the reasonable income that the investor
would make. One of the principal variables of these formulas was the oil market price.
For Blocks 7 and 21, the market price taken into account at the time of contracting was
US$ 15/bbl, and the projections of the reciprocal benefits for the investor and the State
during the whole life of the contract was based on this price. At a market price of US$

142.

143.

15/bbl, the investor could cover its expenses and obtain a reasonable return on its
investment.?”

The unprecedented increase in oil prices affected the economic equilibrium on which
the contract was based. While Ecuador initially attempted to redress this economic
disequilibrium through negotiations, this attempt was unsuccessful. In point of fact,
Burlington refused outright Ecuador's request for a fairer distribution of the oil
production.?

As a result, Ecuador sought to restore the economic equilibrium of the PSCs via the
enactment of Law 42. The original proposals discussed were for a State participation
of 80% of the extraordinary revenues. Eventually, Congress approved the bill with a
State participation of 60%. However, President Palacio vetoed this bill and
recommended that the formula "at least 50%" be used. With this modification, Law 42
was enacted on 19 April 2006. On 6 September 2006, the Ecuadorian Constitutional
Court declared Law 42 constitutional.?”°

However, Law 42 proved to be insufficient to attain the equilibrium point. Therefore, in
October 2007, a year and a half after Law 42 was passed, Decree 662 increased the
State's participation in extraordinary revenues from 50% to 99%.?”°

Two months later, Ecuador passed the Ley de Equidad Tributaria ("LET"), aimed to
open a new avenue of negotiations with oil companies. Under the LET, the State's
participation on extraordinary revenues would be 70%, and the reference price could
be increased on a case-by-case basis. Except for Burlington and Perenco, all major
companies operating in Ecuador took advantage of the LET. In April 2008, Ecuador
announced that these transitory agreements would be in force for a maximum of a year
before they would be migrated to service contracts. In the same month, on 21 April
2008, Burlington started arbitration proceedings against Ecuador.?””

In August 2008, Burlington revealed its plan to leave Ecuador. From that point on,
Burlington blocked all of Ecuador's attempts to reach an agreement in relation to the
PSCs. In fact, Perenco and PetroEcuador reached an agreement on terms that were
fair and reasonable. However, Burlington, displaying both bad faith and a lack of a

147.

genuine intention to reach a negotiated solution, refused to accept this agreement.
This was in marked contrast with Ecuador's attitude, which was always open to
dialogue and willing to reach an amicable solution.*”

2.2. Law 42 did not modify or breach the PSCs and, at any rate, any alleged
contract breach cannot amount to a Treaty breach

Ecuador advances the following six propositions. First, Law 42 did not modify the
PSCs. Second, Law 42 did not breach the PSCs' clause ensuring Burlington a fixed
participation in crude production. Third, Law 42 is not a "royalty" and thus Burlington
has no right to be exempt from its application. Fourth, the renegotiation clauses have
not been triggered nor breached. Fifth, clauses 3.1 and 22.1 of the PSCs are of no
assistance to Burlington. Sixth and alternatively, if the Tribunal were to find that
Ecuador somehow breached the PSCs, these contract breaches could not amount to a
Treaty breach.?”°

First, Law 42 did not modify the PSCs. Law 42 deals only with oil prices. The PSCs, in
turn, deal only with oil volumes and contain no provisions on oil prices. Thus, Law 42
simply cannot modify the PSCs. This is the conclusion which the Constitutional Court
of Ecuador also reached. The Constitutional Court ruled that Law 42 did not modify the
PSCs.°

Second, Law 42 did not breach the PSCs' clause ensuring Burlington a fixed
participation in crude production. It is undisputed that Law 42 did not hinder
Burlington's right to dispose of its share of crude production. However, Burlington self-
servingly reads into this clause a right to not be subject to any measures the effect of
which would be to reduce its revenues. Yet, if Burlington had this right — it does not —
there would be no purpose in the renegotiation clauses, which apply precisely when
there is a modification of the tax regime.

Third, and although it appears that Burlington has abandoned this argument following
the Decision on Jurisdiction, Law 42 is not a "royalty" and thus Burlington has no right
to be exempt from its application. Law 42 is not a royalty because it is part of Article 55
of the EHL, not of Article 54, where royalties are mentioned, and because, if it were a
royalty, there would have been no need to amend Article 44 of the EHL, which already

Id., 19 235-250.
Id., 19 255-260.
Id., at § 268-272

56

148.

149.

150.

included the term royalties. Moreover, Law 42 does not have the characteristics of a
royalty. It is a levy and, as such, is governed by the renegotiation clauses.**'

Fourth, the renegotiation clauses have been neither triggered nor breached by the
application of Law 42. Indeed, Law 42 had no "impact on the economy" of the PSCs,
which is an indispensable requirement for the application of these clauses. The
"economy" of a PSC, under Ecuadorian law, is determined "as of the date it was

executed"?

(emphasis in the original). At that time, the Parties agreed to use the
economic model prepared by Eng. Celio Vega (the "Vega Model"). Amid other
variables, the Vega Model included a constant oil price of US$ 15/bbl for the entire life
of the PSCs. Yet, crucially, Law 42 applied only to oil prices higher than the US$
15/bbl mark upon which the Vega Model was predicated. Thus, Law 42 did not impact
the economy of the PSCs.”°*

On the other hand, if the Tribunal found that Law 42 did affect the economy of the
PSCs, Ecuador has not breached the renegotiation clauses because "an obligation to
negotiate does not imply an obligation to reach an agreement."** Ecuador was always
available to negotiate with Burlington; if no agreement was reached, it was due to
Burlington. Moreover, this Tribunal does not have the power to rewrite the terms of the
PSCs in case the Parties failed to negotiate or to reach an agreement. It would not
even have jurisdiction to do so, because this would not be a "legal" dispute under
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.?°

Fifth, Clauses 3.1 and 22.1 of the PSCs are of no assistance to Burlington. These are
not stabilization clauses. Clause 3.1 merely incorporates the principle of pacta sunt
servanda. Law 42 does not affect this principle because it addresses a matter —
extraordinary revenues — which was not regulated in the PSCs. Nor is Clause 22.1 a
stabilization clause because (i) it does not expressly exclude the application of future
laws and regulations; (ii) it is a mere rule of contract interpretation which does not
preclude the application of subsequent laws and regulations; (iii) it operates as a
choice of law provision; (iv) other clauses in the PSCs fail to distinguish between laws

enacted before the entry into force of the PSCs and thereafter; (v) otherwise the
renegotiation clauses would serve no purpose.*°

Sixth and alternatively, if the Tribunal found that Ecuador somehow breached the
PSCs, these purported contract breaches could not amount to a treaty breach. As
explained by the Vivendi ad hoc annulment Committee, not every breach of contract
amounts to a breach of treaty.” A contract breach amounts to a treaty breach if there
is an “effective repudiation of the right [...] which has the effect of preventing its

exercise entirely or to a substantial extent."?%

3. Ecuador did not expropriate Burlington's investment
3.1. Law 42 did not expropriate Burlington's investment in Blocks 7 and 21

Burlington's expropriation claim does not stand. As a threshold matter, Burlington
bears a high burden of proof. Since Burlington is challenging a tax measure, it must
prove, in accordance with EnCana, that Law 42 was “extraordinary, punitive in amount
or arbitrary in its incidence",”° and that its effects amount to expropriation of its

investment. Burlington has failed to establish that these elements are met.°°

In any event, Law 42 (i) was a legitimate and bona fide exercise of its sovereign tax
powers, and (ii) it did not expropriate Burlington's investment.”

First, Law 42 was a legitimate and bona fide exercise of Ecuador's tax powers. Under
international law, legitimate and bona fide State regulatory measures, such as Law 42,
do not constitute expropriation and, consequently, are non compensable. Specifically,
Law 42 must be presumed to be a valid measure not entitling Burlington to
compensation unless proven otherwise. To rebut this presumption, Burlington must
show with clear and convincing evidence that Ecuador's exercise of its sovereign

power was illegitimate or abusive. However, Burlington has made no such showing.

Law 42 was a legitimate and bona fide exercise of Ecuador's tax power because its
goal was to remedy the imbalance caused by the massive and unforeseen increase in
oil prices. As a result of this imbalance, Burlington had an obligation to renegotiate the

157.

158.

PSCs in good faith and Ecuador had a duty to legislate to obtain a fair allocation of oil
revenues. Nevertheless, Burlington “obstinately refused" to renegotiate the PSCs.*°°
In view of the failed renegotiations, Ecuador was under a constitutional mandate to
seek a fair allocation of the revenues derived from its hydrocarbons. Law 42 was an
appropriate means of furthering that mandate.?**

Second, even if the Tribunal were to find that Law 42 is an illegitimate regulatory
measure, Law 42 did not expropriate Burlington's investment. Law 42 has not
expropriated Burlington's investment, whether directly or indirectly. Law 42 did not
directly expropriate Burlington's investment because it did not physically seize
Burlington's investment, nor did it revoke, cancel or repudiate Burlington's rights under
the PSCs.¥° Likewise, Law 42 did not indirectly expropriate Burlington's investment.
There is an indirect expropriation when the effects of the challenged measure are
equivalent to a taking. In particular, the investor must show that the challenged
measure caused a total and permanent loss of value or control of the investment.
Burlington has shown neither.?°°

Burlington has failed to show that Law 42 at 50% expropriated its investment. The
following evidence in fact proves that there was no expropriation: (i) the Consortium's
tax reports show that, even with the Law 42 payments, 2006 and 2007 were more
profitable than 2005; (ii) the Fair Links expert report concludes that Burlington's
operations were not "uneconomic" as alleged by Burlington; (iii) the Consortium
submitted an amended plan for additional developments in Block 7, demonstrating that,
even with the Law 42 payments, it made economic sense to invest additional capital
(the "Oso Development Plan"); (iv) ConocoPhillip's annual reports for the years 2006-
2008 show no losses in Ecuador.

In addition, as previously demonstrated, Law 42 did not breach the PSCs. Hence, there
can be no expropriation, since Burlington claims precisely the value of its rights under
the PSCs. Finally, Law 42 cannot constitute expropriation because it does not cause a
permanent deprivation of Burlington's investment: it applies if and only if the market
price of Ecuadorian crude exceeds the reference price. In fact, contrary to the
impression that Burlington seeks to create, oil market prices have not always been

161.

162.

above the reference price, e.g. January and February 2009. In sum, Law 42 at the
50% rate did not expropriate Burlington's investment.?%”

Similarly, Law 42 at the 99% rate did not expropriate Burlington's investment. Law 42
at the 50% rate was insufficient to induce oil companies operating in Ecuador to
negotiate a new contractual framework. Decree 662, which increased the rate to 99%,
had the effect of prompting companies to sign new service contracts, with the
exception of Burlington and Perenco”®. Burlington has submitted no evidence that
Law 42 at 99% deprived its investment of value. In actuality, Law 42 at 99% did not
produce effects tantamount to expropriation, as shown by the same facts as those
referred in connection with Law 42 at 50%.” In particular, Fair Links concluded that

Decree 662 "did not alter the global trend of positive cash flows."°°

3.2. Ecuador's enforcement of Law 42 through the coactiva process was not an
expropriatory measure under Article Ill of the Treaty
Contrary to Burlington's allegations, the coactiva process did not constitute an
expropriation. Ecuador resorted to the coactiva process to enforce its laws and in
doing so, it did not expropriate Burlington's investment.

PetroEcuador is an agency authorized to use the coactiva, a process whereby an
administrative agency may enforce obligations without the need for an order or
authorization from State courts. In particular, PetroEcuador was entitled to collect Law
42 payments. In the coactiva process, if the debtor does not pay his debt after being
notified on two occasions, his assets are seized and eventually auctioned off. In the
first auction round, offers may not be lower than two thirds of the appraised value of the
asset. If no bids are submitted during the first round, a second round is convened, at
which offers may not be lower than 50% of the appraised value of the auctioned
asset.°"!

The coactiva process did not expropriate Burlington's investment. Burlington seeks to
create the appearance that PetroEcuador benefitted from the auction process by
acquiring the Consortium's oil at a "steep discount." However, PetroEcuador simply
purchased the seized production at the discounts authorized under Ecuadorian law.
Moreover, it was only in the first auction that PetroEcuador waited until the second

165.

round to present its offer, for it was unaware that no other company would take part in
the auctions. After the first auction, PetroEcuador always submitted its bids during the
first round, offering a price slightly above the minimum authorized by law. Other
companies were dissuaded from participating in these auctions because the
Consortium threatened to take legal action against any prospective buyer of the seized
crude.°”

Further, the coactiva process did not constitute a direct expropriation of Burlington's
investment because Ecuador did not intend to deprive Burlington of its investment but
merely to enforce a legitimate credit. In any event, the effect of this process was neutral
since, as recognized by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 1, every time oil was
seized, previous Law 42 payments were extinguished. Finally, Burlington fails to
explain how Ecuador's non-compliance with the Tribunal's recommendation in
Provisional Order No. 1 can be deemed an expropriation.°%

3.3. Ecuador's intervention following Burlington's abandonment of Blocks 7 and
21 in July 2009 neither completed the alleged expropriation nor effected a
direct expropriation
Ecuador's intervention in Blocks 7 and 21 did not constitute an expropriation of
Burlington's investment. It was provoked by Burlington's unilateral decision to suspend
operations and aimed at preventing significant harm to the Blocks. Hence, Ecuador's
intervention was necessary, adequate, proportionate under the circumstances, and
meant to be temporary.* Ultimately, Burlington's decision to suspend operations was
a "calculated act" intended to force Ecuador to act in order to avoid damage to the
Blocks.°%°

Burlington adopted active steps to suspend operations in the Blocks even though (i)
this course of action was not economically justified, as Burlington had the financial
resources to continue operating the Blocks, e.g. the Law 42 payments made into the
segregated bank account; (ii) the suspension would have resulted in the breach of both
the PSCs and Ecuadorian law; and (iii) the suspension would have caused significant
economic loss and serious damage to the Blocks. As part of its self-expropriation

169.

strategy, Burlington knew that this would prompt Ecuador to act in order to prevent
306

damage to the Blocks.
Burlington announced that the suspension would take place at noon on 16 July 2009.
Ecuador, in turn, indicated that, if the Consortium suspended operations, It would take
appropriate measures to prevent the suspension. On 16 July 2009, Ecuadorian
government officials entered the Blocks at 2:00 PM. Contrary to what Burlington has
alleged, the entry was amicable, not by force. In fact, the Blocks were still in operation
at that time because the Consortium's employees had decided to ignore Perenco's
instructions. Furthermore, on the same day, PetroEcuador issued a Resolution
declaring the state of emergency in the Blocks and authorizing PetroAmazonas —
PetroEcuador's subsidiary — to adopt the necessary measures to ensure the continuity
of operations.*°”

Burlington's decision to unilaterally suspend operations in the Blocks was not
economically justified. Burlington had the funds necessary to continue operating the
Blocks, as shown by the Law 42 payments it had made into a segregated off-shore
account. After the enactment of Law 42 and Decree 662, it had also made minimum
investments in the Blocks and, if the seized oil was auctioned at below market prices,
this was due to the Consortium's active hostility against potential bidders.°%

Burlington's unilateral suspension of operations was in breach of Ecuadorian law and of
the PSCs. Under the Ecuadorian Constitution, suspension of public services, which
expressly include "hydrocarbon production", is forbidden. In addition, Burlington had
no justification to suspend operations because the principle exceptio non adimpleti
contractus finds almost no application under Ecuadorian administrative law.
Accordingly, Burlington was bound to perform its obligations despite any alleged
breach on Ecuador's part.°°

Ecuador intervened in the Blocks to enforce its laws within its police powers and to
avoid the significant economic loss and damage to the Blocks that the Consortium's
unilateral suspension of operations would have caused. Barring intervention, the
Consortium's abandonment of the Blocks would have caused reservoir, mechanical
and environmental damage to the Blocks, and significant economic loss to the State.

Burlington suspended operations only to induce Ecuador to intervene in the Blocks, in
furtherance of its self-expropriation strategy.°"°

Ecuador's intervention in the Blocks was appropriate. Burlington was duly informed of
the consequences that the suspension of operations would carry, whereas Ecuador
entered the Blocks amicably and expressly assured Burlington that its rights under the
PSCs would remain unaffected.*"' Ecuador's intervention was a means proportionate

to the goal of avoiding damage to the Blocks.°”

Finally, expropriation requires
permanent deprivation. This requirement is not met in this case because Ecuador's
intervention was a temporary measure meant to cease once the Consortium resumed

operations.*"*

3.4. In any event, Ecuador did not unlawfully expropriate Burlington's
investment in Blocks 7 and 21

In the event that the Tribunal were nevertheless to conclude that the measures
discussed in the previous sections constituted an expropriation of Burlington's
investment, such expropriation was a lawful one. Ecuador submits that the failure to
pay compensation pursuant to Article Ill(1) of the Treaty does not render the
expropriation unlawful if the expropriation is disputed. Moreover, the expropriation was
not unfair and inequitable, arbitrary or in contravention of Ecuador's obligations to
Burlington.°"

First, Ecuador's failure to compensate Burlington does not render the expropriation
unlawful, because the expropriation is disputed. The expropriation must occur before
compensation is offered. This case is first and foremost about whether there is
expropriation in the first place. Compensation becomes a relevant question only after it
is established that there is expropriation. Were it otherwise, every single case of
indirect expropriation would almost invariably become a case of unlawful
expropriation.°*"®

Second, had there been expropriation, it was not unfair and inequitable because Law
42 sought to restore the "economy" of the PSCs. Law 42 was a bona fide, legitimate
exercise of Ecuador's sovereign tax powers, which did not cause Burlington to

surrender any right under the PSCs. In addition, the alleged expropriation would not
have been arbitrary because Ecuador has submitted itself to the jurisdiction of this
Tribunal, never interfering with its authority; nor were the coactiva measures arbitrary
for they merely enforced Ecuador's Law 42 tax. Finally, the expropriation would not
have been in breach of Ecuador's obligations as the PSCs were neither modified nor
breached.°"°

D. Ecuapor's REQUEST FOR RELIEF

174. On the basis of this position, Ecuador requests the Tribunal to render an award:

"10.1 Declaring

fair and equitable treatment claim and Law 42 arbitrary
impairment of the investment claim, Section III(B)(2), paragraphs
102 to 122, pages 56 to 68 of Burlington’s Supplemental
Memorial are struck off the record;

ANALYSIS

175. The Arbitral Tribunal has deliberated and considered the Parties’ written and oral

submissions and arguments. To the extent that these arguments have not been
referred to expressly, they must be deemed to be subsumed in the analysis. This
analysis addresses Ecuador's outstanding jurisdictional and admissibility defenses and
Burlington's Treaty claims on the merits.*"® If Ecuador is found liable to Burlington, a
quantum phase will be held at a later stage of the proceedings. In parallel to
Burlington's claims, this arbitration will also deal with Ecuador's counterclaims.

176. At the outset of the analysis, the Tribunal will consider some preliminary matters,

including the law applicable to the merits and the relevance of previous decisions of
international courts and tribunals (A); subsequently, it will examine Ecuador's
outstanding jurisdictional and admissibility objections (B) and Burlington's claims on the
merits (C). Finally, the Tribunal will set forth its decision (Section V).

A. PRELIMINARY MATTERS

1. Law Applicable to the Merits

177. Burlington's claims are based upon the United States - Ecuador BIT, which is thus the

178.

primary source of law for this Tribunal. With respect to matters not covered by the BIT,
the latter contains no choice of law. The Tribunal must thus resort to Article 42 (1) of
the ICSID Convention, which provides that:

"(1) The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules

of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such

agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State

party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and

such rules of international law as may be applicable.
Except for the undisputed application of the BIT, the Parties to this dispute have not
agreed on the rules of law that govern the merits of this dispute in the sense of Article
42(1), first sentence. Therefore, according to the second sentence of Article 42(1), the
Tribunal must "apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute [...] and such
rules of international law as may be applicable." Indeed, the Parties have made their
submissions under the correct assumption that both Ecuadorian law and international
law govern the merits of this dispute.
The Tribunal has already determined that it has jurisdiction over Burlington's expropriation

claims, but must still ascertain whether it has jurisdiction over the umbrella clause claims (DJ,
342).

66

179.

180.

181.

182.

As a result, the Tribunal will apply (i) first and foremost the BIT and, if need be, (ii)
Ecuadorian law and those rules of international law "as may be applicable". In this
latter respect, the Tribunal is of the view that the second sentence of Article 42(1) of
the ICSID Convention does not allocate matters to either law. It is thus for the
arbitrators to determine whether an issue is subject to national or international law. In
this context, it should be noted that the PSCs include a choice of Ecuadorian law.°*"° It
should further be noted that a party may not rely on its internal law to avoid an
obligation under international law.

2. Ecuador's Request that Section III(B)(2) of Burlington's Supplemental Memorial
on Liability be Struck From the Record
Ecuador requests that Section III(B)(2) of Burlington's Supplemental Memorial on
Liability be struck from the record on the ground that it reintroduces, under the guise of
its surviving expropriation claim, the fair and equitable treatment and arbitrary
impairment claims over which the Tribunal has already ruled that it has no jurisdiction.
Ecuador argues that, whereas Article IIl(1) of the Treaty undoubtedly refers to the
principles of treatment of Article II(3), Burlington improperly relies on this reference to
establish that there was expropriation. However, the principles of treatment of Article
1l(3) of the Treaty only become relevant once it has been established that there was

expropriation to begin with.°”°

Article IlIl(1) of the Treaty provides that "investments shall not be expropriated except
[...] in accordance with the general principles of treatment provided for in Article 1I(3)."
The Tribunal agrees that this provision is only triggered if it is established that there is
an expropriation. If there is an expropriation, it must be effected in accordance with the
principles of treatment spelled out in Article II(3) of the Treaty. If there is no

expropriation, this provision is inapposite.

Burlington's submissions do not suggest a different interpretation of this provision. In
the Tribunal's understanding, Burlington relies on the principles of treatment of Article

Clause 22.1 of the PSC for Block 7 provides that "[t]his Contract is governed exclusively by
Ecuadorian legislation, and laws in force at the time of its signature are understood to be
incorporated by reference" (Exh. C-1). Likewise, clause 22.1 of the PSC for Block 21 sets forth
that "[t]his Contract is governed exclusively by Ecuadorian legislation, and laws in force at the
time of its signature are understood to be incorporated by reference” (Exh. C-2).

Tr. 210:2-213:7. In particular, Ecuador's assertion that "realizing that it's not easy for
[Burlington] to characterize Law 42 as an expropriation, they in fact rely on Article II [of the
Treaty] to characterize it as an expropriation, and that they cannot do. The Treaty does not
permit that" (Tr. 213:3-7).

67

183.

184.

185.

1l(3) of the Treaty merely to establish that the purported expropriation of its investment
was effected unlawfully:

"Article X_of the Treaty and this Tribunal’s ruling in its Decision on
Jurisdiction do not affect the applicability of the principles of Article
I(3)_ to assess the lawfulness of Ecuador's measures as an
expropriation under Article Ill. This Tribunal has jurisdiction over
Burlington's Article Ill expropriation claim under Article X of the Treaty.
As a result, once it finds that an expropriation has occurred, it has
jurisdiction to assess the lawfulness of the expropriation by
determining whether, as Article III(1) requires, the expropriation was
consistent with the principles of treatment enunciated in Article II(3).
Finding that the expropriation was carried out contrary to principles
articulated in Article II(3) does not depend on a stand-alone violation
of Article II(3) and thus does not contravene this Tribunal’s
determination that it does not have jurisdiction under Article X to
assess whether tax measures violated Article (3) of the Treaty.

(d

In sum, Ecuador has expropriated Burlington’s investments through
means contrary to the principles of fair and equitable treatment, the
obligation not to impair investment through arbitrary treatment and the
duty to observe obligations. Ecuador has offered no compensation
whatsoever for its unlawful expropriation. Ecuador is therefore liable
under the Chérzow standard for an unlawful expropriation in violation
of the Treaty and in violation of general principles of international
law."*?! (emphasis added).
On this basis, the Tribunal sees no reason to strike Section III(B)(2) of Burlington's

Supplemental Memorial on Liability from the record.

3. Undisputed Matters

Most of the facts of this case are not in dispute. At the hearing, counsel for the
Claimant noted that this "case [...] is relatively simple on the facts because[,] for the
most part, the facts are not in dispute."*"" While there are a few disputed issues of fact,
the Claimant and the Respondent agree on most of the facts that gave rise to this
dispute — their disagreement being, at its core, about how the petroleum rent should be
allocated between them.

In particular, the Parties do not dispute that (i) beginning in 2002, oil prices rose well
above the prevailing oil price at the time when the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 were
executed; (ii) in November 2005, Ecuador sought to renegotiate the PSCs with
Burlington (and its partner Perenco) for the first time; (iii) after those renegotiations
failed, Ecuador passed sequentially Law 42 in April 2006, Decree 662 in October 2007,

CSM, $§ 106, 122.
Tr. 14:4-6.

68

186.

187.

188.

323

and the LET in December 2007; (iv) Burlington made Law 42 payments to Ecuador
under protest from the time they were first imposed in mid-2006 until May 2008; (v) in
June 2008, Burlington stopped making Law 42 payments to Ecuador, and instead
began making Law 42 payments into a segregated account located in the United
States.

It is further common ground that, following a new round of failed renegotiations in 2008,
(vi) Ecuador initiated coactiva proceedings against Burlington in February 2009 and
began to seize Burlington's share of oil production the following month; (vii) from March
2009 to around mid-2010, PetroEcuador auctioned and, being the sole bidder, acquired
Burlington's share of oil production at below market prices in the context of the coactiva
proceedings; (viii) on 16 July 2009, Burlington and Perenco ceased to operate Blocks 7
and 21; (ix) on that same day, Ecuador took possession of Blocks 7 and 21; (x) in July
2010, Ecuador terminated the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 pursuant to the so-called
caducidad process.

4. Relevance of Decisions of Other International Courts and Tribunals

As stated in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal considers that it is not bound by
previous decisions. Nevertheless, the majority considers that it must pay due regard to
earlier decisions of international courts and tribunals. It believes that, subject to
compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt solutions established in a series of
consistent cases. It further believes that, subject to the specifics of a given treaty and
of the circumstances of the actual case, it has a duty to seek to contribute to the
harmonious development of investment law, and thereby to meet the legitimate
expectations of the community of States and investors towards the certainty of the rule
of law. Arbitrator Stern does not analyze the arbitrator's role in the same manner, as
she considers it her duty to decide each case on its own merits, independently of any
apparent jurisprudential trend.

B. JURISDICTIONAL AND ADMISSIBILITY OBJECTIONS

1. Does the Tribunal Have Jurisdiction over Burlington's Umbrella Clause Claims
under Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty?

. In the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal joined to the merits "the determination of
whether it has jurisdiction over Burlington's Law 42 first umbrella clause claim and over
the first limb of its third umbrella clause claim under Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty"*** (the
“umbrella clause claims"). It did so, on the ground that the Parties had not sufficiently

69

190.

discussed Ecuador's lack of privity objection, which had been raised for the first time at
the hearing on jurisdiction®*. As the Parties have since then argued this point at
length, the issue is now ripe for the Tribunal's determination.

Ecuador maintains that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Burlington's umbrella
clause claims for the following three reasons: (i) by withdrawing the Contract Claims
“with prejudice", Burlington waived its rights under the PSCs and thus the umbrella
clause has no object; (ii) Burlington has no independent rights deriving from the so-
called Hydrocarbons Legal Framework; and (iii) contrary to what the Treaty requires,
there is no privity of contract between Burlington and Ecuador. The Tribunal will
address Ecuador's objections sequentially.

1.1. Is the umbrella clause without "object" as a result of the withdrawal of the
Contract Claims with prejudice?

1.1.1. Positions of the Parties

Ecuador alleges that the Treaty's umbrella clause is of no avail to Burlington because
there is no surviving contractual obligation that could be elevated to the Treaty level via
the umbrella clause. In point of fact, the Burlington Subsidiaries withdrew their contract
claims against Ecuador "with prejudice."*> This amounts to a waiver of all underlying
rights and obligations under the PSCs. Support for this conclusion is to be found in
decisions by ICSID tribunals in Cementownia v. Republic of Turkey (Cementownia)**
and Waste Management v. United Mexican States (Waste Management II).**’ Hence,

Burlington may not elevate extinct contractual obligations to the Treaty level through

8

the umbrella clause.*® This argument is submitted as a jurisdictional objection or,

alternatively, as a defense on the merits. In addition, Ecuador assumed no

independent obligations vis-a-vis Burlington under the Hydrocarbons Law.*”° For these

reasons, the Treaty's umbrella clause has "no object."*°°

Burlington argues that the Tribunal already dismissed this objection in its Decision on
Jurisdiction.**' In any event, Ecuador's objection is flawed insofar as Contract and
Treaty Claims have "separate lives." Once the PSCs were breached, two sets of
claims arose: a set of Contract Claims and a set of Treaty Claims. It is entirely possible
to pursue one set of claims without pursuing the other. These independent sets of
claims involve different Parties — Burlington Resources as opposed to Burlington
Oriente - and different sources of rights — the Treaty as opposed to the PSCs.**°
Moreover, Ecuador also assumed obligations towards Burlington through the specific

regulatory regime embodied in the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework.

1.1.2. Analysis

In its submissions on the merits, Ecuador raised the argument of the waiver of the
contract rights. To the extent that it deals with jurisdiction, this objection would be
barred because the jurisdictional phase was closed but for the privity issue. Indeed, in
the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal held that "the Parties may not re-argue or
present new arguments on any jurisdictional issue other than the privity objection with
respect to Burlington's outstanding umbrella clause claims."*°°

Be this as it may, Ecuador has also submitted this argument as one on the merits. At
the hearing on liability, counsel for Ecuador stated: "[I]f the Tribunal was to decide that
this is not an admissible jurisdictional objection at this stage, we deal with it as a
defense on the merits [...]."°%° As a defense on the merits, Ecuador's argument is not
precluded by the terms of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction. It raises an issue that
bears an obvious connection to the merits, to wit, whether Burlington has any umbrella
clause rights at all. Hence, the Tribunal will entertain Ecuador's new argument as a
defense on the merits.

Ecuador's defense is based on the premise that a withdrawal of claims with prejudice
results in a waiver of the rights underlying those claims. In this way, the Burlington
Subsidiaries' withdrawal of their contract claims with prejudice waived the underlying

Tr. 189:11-14. Counsel for Ecuador also pointed out: "Where does the Umbrella Clause stand in
that context [of substantive and jurisdictional clauses]? They [umbrella clauses] can reasonably
achieve two objectives, and that’s reflected in Mr. Vandevelde's commentary which both Jan
Paulsson and | mentioned in the opening." (Tr. 1336:22-1337:4).

198.

contractual rights. Ecuador finds support for this argument in two ICSID decisions:
Cementownia and Waste Management Il. In Cementownia, the tribunal quoted the
following passage from the Waste Management II decision:

"In international litigation the withdrawal of a claim does not, unless

otherwise agreed, amount to a waiver of any underlying rights of the

withdrawing party."**’ (emphasis added).
On the basis of Cementownia and Waste Management II, Ecuador argues that a
withdrawal with prejudice amounts to an agreement to waive the rights underlying
those claims. Applied to this case, the withdrawal of the Contract Claims with prejudice
would be the equivalent of a waiver of the underlying rights. The Tribunal cannot follow
this argument for the following reasons.

First, it arises from the two cases referred to by Ecuador that the rule is that a
withdrawal of claims does not amount to a waiver of rights. It further arises that as an
exception to the rule, the parties may agree otherwise, in which case the withdrawal of
claims operates as a waiver of substantive rights. Albeit not directly applicable to the
withdrawal of claims in this arbitration, Ecuadorian procedural law seems to apply the
same rule. Specifically, Article 377 of the Ecuadorian Code of Civil Procedure provides
that the party who withdraws a claim "cannot re-file" this claim against the same person
or against its legal representative.

Thus, the question here is whether the Tribunal should apply the exception rather than
the rule, that is whether the Parties intended the withdrawal of the Subsidiaries’ Claims
to operate as a waiver of the underlying substantive rights. The evidence on record
suggests the contrary. By letter of 10 October 2009, counsel for the Initial Claimants
confirmed that the Burlington Subsidiaries would withdraw their contract claims "with
prejudice" because they saw "no reason to preserve [their] right to re-file the

"338

contractual claims in the future. In other words, the avowed purpose of the

withdrawal with prejudice was to renounce the possibility to "re-file the contractual

claims in the future,"°°°

it was not to waive contractual rights for purposes of this
proceeding. Therefore, no intent to waive the contract rights may be inferred from the

letter of 10 October 2009 confirming the withdrawal with prejudice.

More generally, Burlington's continuing prosecution of the umbrella claim under the
Treaty belies an intent by its Subsidiaries to waive their rights under the PSCs. As

202.

counsel for the Claimant stressed at the hearing, Burlington's umbrella clause claims
were "present from the beginning of this arbitration and were never waived."*° The
Treaty's umbrella clause can only become operative if underlying rights arising from
another source do exist. Considering that the umbrella clause claim was pending at the
time of withdrawal of the Subsidiaries’ claims, one cannot understand the Burlington
Subsidiaries to have intended to waive the very rights on which Burlington's umbrella
clause claim was predicated.

In sum, the Burlington Subsidiaries have waived the possibility of ever re-filing their
claims under the PSCs in any form in the future. They have not waived the underlying
rights and Burlington may thus rely on these underlying rights to pursue its Treaty

claims in this arbitration.

1.2. May Burlington rely on the Treaty's umbrella clause to enforce its purported
rights under the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework?

1.2.1. Positions of the Parties

According to Ecuador, Burlington may not rely on the Treaty's umbrella clause to
enforce its purported rights under the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework because (i)
Ecuador has not “entered into" any obligation in enacting the Hydrocarbons Legal
Framework, (ii) the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework is of a general nature and
unrelated to any specific investment, and (iii) in any event, the Hydrocarbons Legal
Framework imposes no obligation upon Ecuador. On the other hand, Burlington
submits that the Treaty's umbrella clause covers the specific, unilateral commitments
Ecuador made to oil companies under the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework. In
particular, Ecuador committed to indemnify oil companies for any increase in the tax
burden and to adjust the oil participation formulas.

1.2.2. Analysis

Article |I(3)(c) of the Treaty, the so-called umbrella clause, provides the following:

"Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with
regard to investments.”

The umbrella clause only becomes operative to the extent that a State party to the BIT
has entered into an "obligation." Burlington contends that, by enacting the
Hydrocarbons Legal Framework, Ecuador entered into (i) an obligation to absorb the
effects of any tax increase pursuant to Article 16 of Decree of No. 1417 and (ii) an

Tr. 1294:2-6.

73

203.

204.

205.

206.

obligation to ensure that Burlington would receive its fixed participation of monthly
crude production according to Article 4 of Law No. 1993-44.

Article 16 of Decree No. 1417 ("Article 16") lays down the following:

"Economic stability: The parties' production shares in the contract area

will be adjusted when the tax system applicable to the contract has
been modified, in order to restore the economics of the contract in
place before the tax modification"*' (emphasis added).

Article 4 of Law No. 1993-44 ("Article 4") provides in its relevant part that:

"Once production is initiated, the contractor will have the right to a
share of production in the contract area, which will be calculated in
accordance with the production shares offered and agreed upon
therein, based upon the volume of hydrocarbons produced"*”*
(emphasis added).

Both legal provisions presuppose the existence of a "contract." Without a contract,
these provisions are inoperative. Thus, Article 16 refers to "production shares in the
contract'*’ and to "the tax system applicable to the contract."** For its part, Article 4
provides that the "contractor will have the right to a share of production in the contract
area." This prerequisite "contract" that would trigger the application of these
provisions is naturally one that would be executed in the future. This explains why
Article 4 states that the contractor "will have the right" — that is, the contractor has no
vested right at that point, but "will have the right" once the PSC containing such "right"

is executed.

Under these legal provisions, Ecuador bound itself to include certain rights in the PSCs
to be executed in the future. Hence, the purpose of these provisions was to guarantee
future contractors certain contractual rights. But once these contractual rights were
effectively incorporated into the actual PSCs, the purpose of these legal provisions
would be exhausted. No "obligation" under the legal provisions would survive beyond
that point. In this case, it appears that the purpose of these provisions was fulfilled:
Ecuador entered into PSCs with the Burlington Subsidiaries, and these PSCs did
reproduce the terms of Article 16 and of Article 4. As counsel for Ecuador pointed out
at the hearing on liability:

208.

"Suppose there was no [production sharing] contract or [that we]
plac[e] ourselves before there is a contract. What is promised by this

Article [16] and to whom? One could argue, well, it's a promise to
offer that to a foreign investor and to accept a contract containing a

clause more or less reproducing this. All right. Let's admit that, and
then we shall see. We do see that the promise was kept. The
Participation Contracts contained this undertaking. And from the
moment the Participation Contracts are signed, there is an
undertaking but it is a contractual undertaking"** (emphasis added).

In fact, the purpose of these legal provisions was exhausted when the promises made
under law were turned into contractual obligations. Accordingly, these provisions no
longer contain an "obligation" independent of the PSCs upon which Burlington may rely
for purposes of the umbrella clause.**” For these reasons, Burlington may not avail
itself of the umbrella clause to bring claims based solely on Ecuador's Hydrocarbons
Legal Framework. On account of this finding, the Tribunal does not need to examine
Ecuador's remaining objections to Burlington's umbrella clause claim based on
Ecuador's laws and regulations.

1.3. May Burlington rely on the Treaty's umbrella clause to enforce its
subsidiary's rights under the PSCs despite the alleged absence of privity
between Burlington and Ecuador?

1.3.1. Positions of the Parties

Ecuador alleges that Burlington may not rely on the umbrella clause to enforce its
subsidiaries’ rights under the PSCs because, contrary to the requirement of the
umbrella clause, there is no privity of contract between Burlington and Ecuador. Privity
between a creditor and a debtor is part of the ordinary meaning of the term "obligation"
in the umbrella clause. The expression "with regard to investments" narrows down the
scope of the "obligations" and thus of the umbrella clause. "Not being a creditor under
the [PSCs], Burlington Resources cannot become a creditor under the umbrella clause,
the scope of which must reflect the scope of the contractual obligations."** In support
of its position, Ecuador relies primarily on the ICSID decisions in Azurix, Siemens and
the CMS annulment. It also invokes Gustav Hamester v. Ghana. Hence, there is a

"series of consistent cases" which construe the umbrella clause as requiring privity.*“°

Tr. 208:12-22.

This is not to say, however, that the provisions of the Hydrocarbons Law upon which Burlington
relies serve no purpose whatsoever. Since the PSCs were to reproduce these provisions —
which they did as Ecuador has admitted — they may assist in construing those provisions that
were incorporated into the PSCs pursuant to the promises made in the Hydrocarbons Legal
Framework.

Tr. 193:18-21.

Tr. 199:2-3.

75

209.

210.

211.

212.

Finally, Ecuador states that the decisions upon which Burlington relies, Continental
Casualty and Duke Energy, are of no assistance on this issue.

Burlington, on the other hand, submits that the Treaty's umbrella clause requires no
privity. The umbrella clause applies to "any obligation [...] entered into with regard to
investments."** The reference to "any obligation" shows that the clause is meant to be
broad and cover all obligations. The choice of the word "investment" is telling. The
Treaty only requires that the obligations be entered "with regard to [Burlington's]
investments", and not the investor, i.e. Burlington. In accordance with Article | of the
Treaty, "investments" covers both direct and indirect investments. Thus, the plain
language of the Treaty does not require privity. A narrower formulation calling for
privity could have been used, but Ecuador and the United States "deliberately chose
the broader term in the Umbrella Clause."**" In addition, Ecuador's interpretation of the
umbrella clause is contrary to the purpose of the Treaty, which protects both direct and
indirect investments. Burlington denies that there is a "series of consistent cases"
requiring privity and points to the decision in Continental Casualty.

1.3.2. Analysis

The Tribunal will focus on the Treaty's umbrella clause and its interpretation under
international law (i), and then turn to the ICSID case law dealing with the issue of the
umbrella clause's scope (ii).

(i) The interpretation of the Treaty's umbrella clause

The Treaty's umbrella clause reads as follows:

"Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with

regard to investments.”
In application of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the Tribunal will
interpret the umbrella clause in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms in
their context and in light of the object and purpose of the Treaty. To avoid any
ambiguity in the context of the debate on the significance of umbrella clauses, the
Tribunal stresses that the interpretation question it faces is not whether the term
"obligation" comprises commitments deriving from laws and regulations in addition to
contract as some tribunals have found.*** Here, there is no doubt that the obligations at

issue arise out of a contract. Nor is the question whether obligations resulting from a
commercial contract should be protected under the umbrella clause, or in other words
whether a distinction should be made depending on the State's acting as a sovereign
or as a merchant.** Here, if the hurdle of the contract partner is overcome, there is no
question that Ecuador entered into the PSCs as a sovereign.** The question at hand
is exclusively whether the umbrella clause protection applies to obligations entered into
not between the State and the investor and Claimant, but between the State and an
affiliate of the investor.

Bearing these delimitations in mind, the Tribunal first notes that the Treaty's umbrella
clause imposes an obligation on the Contracting States ("shall observe"). Their
obligation consists in observing “any obligation", which terms are further specified by
the words "entered into" and "with regard to investments."

The word "obligation" is thus the operative term of the umbrella clause. The Treaty
does not define "obligation". The Parties agree — and rightly so — that the clause refers
to legal obligations. This is of little assistance, however, to resolve the question of
privity. To answer this question, the Tribunal relies primarily on two elements which in
its view inform the ordinary meaning of "obligation." First, in its ordinary meaning, the
obligation of one subject is generally seen in correlation with the right of another. Or,
differently worded, someone's breach of an obligation corresponds to the breach of
another's right.*°> An obligation entails a party bound by it and another one benefiting
from it, in other words, entails an obligor and an obligee. Second, an obligation does
not exist in a vacuum. It is subject to a governing law. Although the notion of
obligation is used in an international treaty, the court or tribunal interpreting the treaty
may have to look to municipal law to give it content. This is not peculiar to "obligation";
it applies to other notions found in investment treaties, e.g. nationality, property,

While the Decision on Jurisdiction held that the PSCs did not qualify as "investment
agreements" under Art. VI(1)(a) and X(2)(c) of the BIT, it did so only because there was no
privity between the Claimant and the Respondent, not because the PSCs were commercial
contracts (DJ, § 235).

exhaustion of local remedies to name just these.°%

In this case, the PSCs are
governed by Ecuadorian law. It is that law that defines the content of the obligation
including the scope of and the parties to the undertaking, i.e. the obligor and the

obligee.

Applying these two elements to this case, one cannot but conclude that the umbrella
clause does not protect obligations arising from the PSCs. Whose right is correlated to
the obligation? The answer is found in the law governing the obligation, here
Ecuadorian law. Burlington has not alleged, not to speak of established, that under
Ecuadorian law the non-signatory parent of a contract party may directly enforce its
subsidiary's rights.

The context of the term "obligation" confirms this conclusion. Although not conclusive
in and of themselves, the words "entered into" can be regarded as reinforcing the idea
of privity. As to the terms "with regard to investments" also employed by the relevant
treaty provision, they denote a "link between the obligation and the investment" as
Burlington argued at the hearing. This is certainly in keeping with the object and
purpose of the Treaty, which are to encourage and protect investments. However, as
Ecuador pleaded, this link "does not replace but qualifies" the notion of obligation.

If there is no obligation in the first place, there is nothing to qualify. Nor can these
qualifications create an "obligation" where there is none to begin with. Burlington
argues that, because the definition of investment in Article | of the Treaty covers both
direct and indirect investment, it is a co-obligee of Ecuador's obligations under the
PSCs. Broad as the definition of investment in the Treaty may be, it cannot
compensate for the absence of an "obligation."

The object and purpose of the Treaty lead to no different conclusion. Burlington claims

that reading a privity component into the umbrella clause would be "contrary to the
"357

spirit of the Treaty"*”’ which, by virtue of the definition of investment in Article |, seeks

to protect both direct and indirect investments. The Tribunal cannot agree. The
umbrella clause is only one of the various substantive protections that the Treaty

bestows upon investors, with the scope of protection depending on the terms of each
specific provision. Other Treaty provisions unquestionably protect both direct and
indirect investments, such as for instance the expropriation clause. The object and
purpose of the Treaty do not impose that all standards of protection have the same
scope.

Burlington further maintains that it would be ironic for it to not be able to rely on the
umbrella clause on the ground that it did not sign the PSCs, when Ecuador has
asserted counterclaims precisely on the basis of the PSCs.*® Here again, the Tribunal
cannot follow this argument for the reason that its jurisdiction over the counterclaims is
based on a specific submission agreement.

As a result, the Tribunal holds that, Burlington may not rely on the Treaty's umbrella
clause to enforce against Ecuador its subsidiary's contract rights under the PSCs for
Blocks 7 and 21. This conclusion is supported by ICSID case law, the import and
meaning of which has been heavily debated by the Parties. Arbitrator Orrego Vicufia
disagrees with these findings for the reasons explained in the attached dissenting
opinion.

(ii) ICSID case law

Before examining the specific cases upon which the Parties rely, the Tribunal must
address a threshold matter concerning the precedential value of ICSID cases.
Burlington has sought to diminish the relevance of some of the cases upon which
Ecuador relies on the ground that statements which Ecuador cites are obiter dicta.
Ecuador for its part has argued that in the context of investment arbitration,
"[elverything counts."** The Tribunal tends to agree with Ecuador. It is correct that
there is no formal rule of stare decisis in international investment arbitration. At the
same time, the Tribunal considers that it should "contribute to the harmonious
development of investment law” and promote a predictable legal order.°®° In this light,
there is no reason to distinguish between obiter dicta and holding. Whether peripheral
or central to the decision, the statements of an international investment tribunal may
provide guidance to investors and host States alike, and may serve to predict the
decisions of future tribunals.

The decisions in Azurix, Siemens and the CMS annulment proceedings appear to
require privity of contract between the investor and the host State for purposes of the
umbrella clause. In an award rendered in July 2006, the Azurix tribunal dealt with an
umbrella clause contained in the United States-Argentina BIT, the wording of which is
identical to the umbrella clause under examination here. The Azurix tribunal held as
follows:

"As already stated by the Tribunal in affirming its jurisdiction within the
limits permitted by the Convention and the BIT, the Tribunal finds that
none of the contractual claims as such refer to a contract between the
parties to these proceedings; neither the Province [of Buenos Aires]
nor ABA are parties to them. While Azurix may submit a claim under
the BIT for breaches by Argentina, there is no undertaking to be
honored by Argentina to Azurix other than the obligations under the
BIT. Even if for argument's sake, it would be possible under Article
1(2)(c) to hold Argentina responsible for the alleged breaches of the
Concession Agreement by the Province, it was ABA and not Azurix
which was the party to this Agreement."**" (emphasis added).

The implication of this reasoning is evident. The parties to the underlying agreement
were the Province of Buenos Aires and ABA, Azurix's subsidiary. Azurix itself was not
a party to the agreement. For this reason, even assuming arguendo that Argentina had
been bound by the agreement, Azurix could not have relied on the treaty's umbrella
clause to bring claims based on that contract against Argentina. The unstated but
obvious premise is that the umbrella clause required privity between the investor and
Argentina.°*

363

Some time later, the tribunal in Siemens“ dealt with an umbrella clause contained in

the Germany-Argentina BIT. This umbrella clause provided that "[eJach Contracting
Party shall observe any other obligation it has assumed with regard to investments by
nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party in its territory." In its award of
February 2007, the Siemens tribunal stated as follows:

"The Tribunal considers that Article 7(2) has the meaning that its
terms express, namely, that failure to meet obligations undertaken by
one of the Treaty parties in respect to any particular investment is
converted by this clause into a breach of the Treaty. Whether_an
arbitral tribunal is the tribunal which has jurisdiction to consider that

The contract between ABA and the Province of Buenos Aires was governed by Argentine law.
The Azurix Tribunal held that, while its inquiry on the merits was governed by the ICSID
Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law, the law of Argentina would assist its
inquiry “into the alleged breaches of the Concession Agreement to which Argentin[e] law
applies". Azurix Award, at § 67 (Exh. CL-121).

breach or whether it should be considered by the tribunals of the host
State of the investor is a matter that this Tribunal does not need to
enter. The Claimant is not a party to the Contract and SITS is not a
party to these proceedings."*** (emphasis added).

Just like in Azurix, the implication is clear. The parties to the underlying contract were

Argentina and SITS, Siemens’ subsidiary.°*

Siemens itself was not a party to the
contract. Therefore, Siemens could not invoke the treaty's umbrella clause in order to
bring contract claims against Argentina. Once again, the implicit premise is that the

umbrella clause requires privity.

In September 2007, the CMS ad hoc Committee issued its decision. While this

1366

Tribunal stated in the Decision on Jurisdiction that "no general rule"*’® on privity could

be extrapolated from the CMS annulment decision, it joined the issue to the merits
because the Parties had not sufficiently discussed it in the course of the jurisdictional
phase.” Now with the benefit of the Parties’ extensive submissions and legal
authorities, the Tribunal is better poised to construct the scope of the Treaty's umbrella
clause.

In the CMS annulment proceedings, Argentina alleged that the tribunal had manifestly
exceeded its powers because it had allowed CMS to bring claims against Argentina

under the umbrella clause even though CMS "was not a party to any of the applicable

1368

instruments. As in Azurix, the applicable umbrella clause was that of the United

States-Argentina BIT, which is identical to the present one. Although the ad hoc
Committee annulled the award for failure to state reasons and not for manifest excess
of powers, it made the following observation in the context of its umbrella clause
analysis:

"The effect of the umbrella clause is not to transform the obligation
which is relied on into something else; the content of the obligation is
unaffected, as is its proper law. If this is so, it would appear that the
parties to the obligation (i.e., the persons bound by it and entitled to

rely on it) are likewise not changed by reason of the umbrella

clause"? (emphasis in original).
The CMS ad hoc Committee expressed the premise which the Azurix and the Siemens
tribunals had left unstated. First, in keeping with this Tribunal's analysis, the ad hoc
Committee stated that an obligation has an obligor ("the person bound by it") and an
obligee ("the person [...] entitled to rely on it"). Second, still in conformity with the
Tribunal's view, the ad hoc Committee stated that the obligation remains governed by
its proper law and that the parties to the obligation are not changed by reason of the
umbrella clause. Thus, the umbrella clause does not expand the universe of obligees
who may rely on the underlying obligation.

Burlington has sought to distinguish the CMS annulment decision on the ground that
CMS was a minority shareholder, whereas in this case Burlington wholly owns the
special investment vehicle party to the PSCs — Burlington Oriente. The Tribunal does
not see why this is a distinguishing factor. Both the CMS annulment Committee and
this Tribunal held that the notion of "obligation" presupposes a person entitled to rely
on it or an obligee. Not being a party to the PSCs, Burlington is not an obligee and
cannot become one for the reason that it owns all the shares of a signatory party.

. Burlington also submits that the CMS tribunal — as opposed to the ad hoc Committee —

indicated that there is "no bar in current international law to the concept of allowing
claims by shareholders independently from those of the corporation concerned"3”° and
that it went on to note that "[w]hether the protected investor is in addition a party to a
concession agreement or a license agreement with the host State is immaterial for the
purpose of finding jurisdiction under those treaty provisions, since there is a direct right
of action of shareholders."*”' Although counsel for the Claimant argued that "[a]d hoc
committees are not inherently superior to [aJrbitral [t]ribunals, whether in their
composition or in their entitlement to create jurisprudence",*” one cannot disregard
that the ICSID Convention entrusts ad hoc committees with the power to annul awards

and that this ad hoc Committee annulled this award on this very point.°”°

In support of the requirement of privity, Ecuador also invokes Gustav Hamester v.
Ghana.** The facts of that case were different because the contract at issue was
between the investor and a State entity, as opposed to a contract between a subsidiary
of the investor and the State. In spite of this difference, this case equally confirms the
need for privity. The Gustav Hamester tribunal observed that the CMS annulment
decision "made it clear that [...] a contractual obligation between a public entity distinct
from the State and a foreign investor cannot be transformed by the magic of the so-

called "umbrella clause" into a treaty obligation of the State towards a protected

"375

investor[.] By the same token, the umbrella clause cannot transform a contract

obligation of the State towards an investor's subsidiary into an obligation to the investor
itself.

Finally, Burlington relies on Continental Casualty, a decision of September 2008.°”

Construing the umbrella clause of the United States-Argentina BIT invoked in Azurix
and CMS, the Continental Casualty tribunal stated that it was "conscious that the

interpretation of umbrella clauses [...] remains controversial and that there is a lack of

377

consistency" with respect to its scope. It eventually dismissed all umbrella clause

claims because the underlying obligations were either too general or covered by the

378

necessity defense. It also mentioned that the obligations covered by the umbrella

clause "may have been entered with persons or entities other than foreign investors

themselves."*”°

It is debatable whether the Azurix, Siemens, and CMS annulment decisions constitute
a "series of consistent cases" stating that the umbrella clause requires privity. Indeed,
the views expressed in these cases are supported by few reasons, if any, and a
different opinion is adopted in Continental Casualty.*°° Be this as it may, it is certain

Burlington also relied on Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of
Ecuador, Award of 18 August 2008 (Exh. CL-41). However, as Ecuador noted, there was no
privity issue in Duke Energy because the investor's majority-owned subsidiary - Electroquil -
was a party to the case and jurisdiction was premised on both an arbitration agreement and an
investment treaty (/d. ¥§ 119, 170). ¥

Continental Casualty, at § 296.

Burlington has also cited the Reader's Guide to the Energy Charter Treaty to buttress its
argument that the umbrella clause in the Treaty must cover both direct and indirect investments
(CSM, § 132). First, as the Claimant conceded, the umbrella clause's formula in the Energy
Charter Treaty is "broader" than in the Treaty under examination (/d.). Second, there is no

that the majority of the ICSID cases law supports the Tribunal's conclusion that the
protection granted under the umbrella clause requires privity between the investor and
the host State.

For these reasons, the majority concludes that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over
Burlington's umbrella clause claims according to which Ecuador would have failed to
adjust the contractor's oil production share and to guarantee the contractor's
participation in oil production.

2. — Are the Caducidad Decrees Part of Burlington's Case?

The Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction on 2 June 2010. Only a few weeks
later, on 20 July 2010, Ecuador's Minister of Non-Renewable Natural Resources
declared the termination of the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 by issuing the so-called
caducidad decrees. The caducidad decrees thus post-date the Tribunal's Decision on
Jurisdiction, as a consequence of which neither Party had the opportunity to address
the caducidad decrees in its jurisdictional pleadings. In this Section, the Tribunal will
examine (i) whether Burlington has challenged the caducidad decrees; if so, (ii)
whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the caducidad decrees, and (iii) whether the
allegations based on the caducidad decrees are admissible.

2.1. Has Burlington challenged the caducidad decrees?

"381 It submits that

Ecuador argues that "caducidad is simply not part of this case.
Burlington contests neither the caducidad decrees nor the procedures leading up to
their declaration.**? Burlington has portrayed the caducidad decrees as being merely
"symbolic" because the purported expropriation of its investment had already been
consummated at the time those decrees were issued. Burlington has not specifically
answered Ecuador's allegations that Burlington has not challenged the caducidad
decrees and that, as a result, the caducidad decrees are not part of this case.
Therefore, the Tribunal will have to determine whether Burlington has challenged the
caducidad decrees on the basis of the whole record.

As part of the factual background to the case, Burlington alleged that Ecuador
terminated the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 via the caducidad process.*** Subsequently,

238.

239.

at the very outset of its legal discussion in the same memorial, Burlington argued that

"Ecuador's measures have deprived [it] of the use and enjoyment of its investments"***

(emphasis added). Burlington then listed six measures which, "both individually and in
"385

the aggregate

termination of the PSCs via the caducidad decrees. While Burlington remarked that
386

, allegedly expropriated its investment: the last measure includes the
this termination was "symbolic because its "investment already had been
expropriated",*®’ it also claimed that “[w]ith this action [...] Ecuador foreclosed any
possibility of Burlington returning to the legal and fiscal regime it had been [previously]
guaranteed [...]."°%8

In other words, in the Supplemental Memorial, Burlington (i) characterized the
caducidad decrees as one of the measures which both individually and in combination
with other measures allegedly expropriated its investment, and (ii) argued that the
caducidad decrees made it impossible to revert to the status quo which it had enjoyed
before the measures of which it complains in this arbitration were adopted. In the view
of the Tribunal, these allegations show that Burlington does challenge the caducidad
decrees.

Similarly, Burlington devoted some attention to the caducidad decrees at the hearing.
First, counsel for Burlington cross-examined Minister Wilson Pastor Morris extensively
on the subject of the caducidad decrees.*° Second, counsel for Burlington referred to
the caducidad decrees as follows during the Parties' closing statements:

"Next, proceedings were commenced for caducidad, a contract
termination method that sought to excuse Ecuador. The allegation
was a breach of Article 74(4) of the Hydrocarbons Law which allegedly
did not permit suspension of operations without ["justa causa'],
without just cause.

Led

Now, of course, the caducidad Decision — let's not_be under any
illusions — was reverse-engineered so that Ecuador sought to escape

from its contractual obligations with the Claimant. The idea that there
could have been any fair consideration of the Claimants' position in a
process whereby the Minister has to judge acts of the Government
that appointed him has no logic, particularly where he was being
advised by Government lawyers whose very description of this
Tribunal's order used the verb "recomendar’ in just the description of

the document when that verb appears nowhere in your order. He was
a judge in his own cause assisted by lawyers to his own cause."*”
(emphasis added).
According to Burlington, Ecuador's goal in enacting the caducidad decrees was to
"escape from its contractual obligations with the Claimant" and the caducidad process
could not be "fair", as the Minister who issued the decrees was a "[jJudge in his own
0391

cause. These statements show once again that Burlington contests both the
process leading to, and the substance of, the caducidad decrees.

In sum, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that Burlington has challenged the caducidad
decrees, which are thereby part of this case. In light of this conclusion, the Tribunal
must address Ecuador's jurisdictional and admissibility objections to the caducidad
decrees.

2.2. Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction over the caducidad decrees?

Ecuador contends that the Tribunal has no ratione materiae jurisdiction over the
caducidad decrees for Blocks 7 and 21. While Burlington has not specifically
countered these jurisdictional objections, it is clear from its argumentation on the merits
that it considers that there is jurisdiction over the caducidad decrees. Therefore, the
Tribunal will address these objections on the basis of Ecuador's arguments and
relevant elements on record.

Ecuador argues that the Tribunal has no contractual or Treaty jurisdiction over the
caducidad decree for Block 7. The Tribunal has no contractual jurisdiction over the
caducidad decrees because clauses 21.2.3°% and 21.2.4°% of the PSC for Block 7
carve out this form of contract termination from the contractual jurisdiction of the
Tribunal. Furthermore, the Tribunal has no Treaty jurisdiction over the caducidad
decree for Block 7 under these clauses because (i) the PSC for Block 7 was signed
after the Treaty was signed, and (ii) that is what the parties to the contract intended to
achieve through the language of clause 20.4.

Tr. 1288:10-15 and 1291:13-1292:3.
Tr. 1291:13-1292:3.

Clause 21.2.3 of the PSC for Block 7 states that when " the Contract is terminated for reasons
other than caducidad, the procedures to which the Parties have agreed in Clause [20] will be
followed." (RCM, § 156); (Exh. C-1).

Clause 21.2.4 of the PSC for Block 7 sets forth that "for purposes of caducidad and other

sanctions, the provisions of Chapter IX of the Hydrocarbons Law will apply." (Exh. C-1); (RCM,
4156).

86

244.

245.

246.

247.

In the same vein, Ecuador maintains that the Tribunal has no contractual or Treaty
jurisdiction over the caducidad decree for Block 21. The Tribunal has no contractual
jurisdiction over caducidad because this is a "legal matter" excluded from the scope of
the arbitration agreement pursuant to clause 20.2 of the contract. In addition, the
Tribunal has no Treaty jurisdiction over the caducidad decrees because (i) the PSC for
Block 21 was signed two years after the Treaty was signed, and (ii) that is what the
parties to the contract intended to achieve through the language of clause 20.2.20.

In other words, Ecuador argues that the original parties to the PSCs for Blocks 7 and
21 intended to carve out caducidad not only from the scope of the PSC, but also from
the scope of the Treaty. Since the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is premised exclusively
on the Treaty, the Tribunal does not need to address per se the question of whether
the original parties intended to remove caducidad from the scope of the PSCs. It must,
however, address the Treaty-based objections.

Ecuador argues that the original parties to the PSC for Block 7 intended to remove
caducidad from the scope of the Treaty, and thus from the scope of the Treaty’s
jurisdiction. They did so by inserting clause 20.4 into the PSC, which reads as follows:

"In addition and without prejudice to the provisions of clauses [20.2]°*

and [20.3]** of this participation contract, the Parties also agree to

submit any investment-related dispute to the Treaties, Conventions,

Protocols and other international law agreements signed and ratified

by Ecuador in accordance with the law."*°°
This clause does not appear to reflect an intent by the original parties to the PSC for
Block 7 to remove caducidad from the scope of the Treaty. The caducidad process is
not specifically mentioned in this clause. Far from signalling an intent to remove
caducidad from the scope of the Treaty, this clause underscores the will of the original
parties to the contract to submit “any investment-related dispute" to international
treaties, of which the United States-Ecuadorian BIT is undoubtedly one. This clause

Clause 20.2 of the PSC for Block 7 provides that "all controversies arising from this Participation

Contract will be settled by arbitration of law in accordance with the provisions of Article 10 of the
Hydrocarbons Law as amended, the Arbitration and Mediation Law [...] and the rules and
procedures laid down in this clause" (Tribunal's translation). There is no mention of caducidad
in clause 20.2 of the PSC for Block 7 (Exh. C-1).

Clause 20.3 of the PSC for Block 7 provides that "[nJotwithstanding the foregoing, from the date
on which the [ICSID Convention] (the "Convention"), signed by the Republic of Ecuador, be
ratified by the Ecuadorian Congress, the Parties commit to submit the controversies or disputed
relating to or arising from the execution of this Participation Contract to the jurisdiction and
competence of the [ICSID] so that they may be settled and resolved in conformity with the
provisions of that Convention [...]" (Tribunal's translation). There is no mention of caducidad in
clause 20.3 of the PSC for Block 7 (Exh. C-1).

Exh. C-1 (Tribunal's translation).

87

appears to reinforce, not to undermine, the Tribunal's Treaty jurisdiction. Even
assuming that the original parties to the PSC for Block 7 intended to remove caducidad
from the scope of the contract's arbitration agreement, there is no evidence that they
intended to remove caducidad from the scope of the Treaty. Therefore, the Tribunal
finds that it has jurisdiction over the caducidad decree for Block 7.

Ecuador similarly argues that the original parties to the PSC for Block 21 intended to
remove caducidad from the scope of the Treaty. According to Ecuador, this follows
from clause 20.2.20 of the PSC, which provides that:

"In the event that the Ecuadorian State or PETROECUADOR enter or

have entered into an international treaty which, in accordance with the

law, provides for the resolution of technical or economic disputes by a

different arbitration mechanism, or if so allowed by Ecuadorian law,

the Parties agree that they will be able to submit the issue in dispute

to that arbitration."*°”
This clause does not suggest that the original parties to the PSC for Block 21 intended
to remove caducidad from the scope of the Treaty, nor does it signal an intent to
diminish the scope of Treaty jurisdiction. It rather shows an intent "to submit"®® to
Treaty arbitration "technical or economic disputes."**? There is no reason to infer that

"400 aim to remove caducidad-related

the terms "technical or economic disputes’
disputes from the scope of Treaty arbitration — especially since the termination of a
PSC has evident economic implications. On the contrary, this clause aims to bolster,
not to weaken, Treaty arbitration. Even assuming that the original parties to PSC for
Block 21 intended to remove caducidad from the scope of the contract's arbitration
agreement, there is no evidence that they intended to remove caducidad from the

401

scope of the Treaty. Thus, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over the

caducidad decree for Block 21.

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that it has ratione materiae jurisdiction under the
Treaty over the caducidad decrees relating to the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21.

Exh. C-2 (Tribunal's translation).

Ecuador also argues that the original parties to the PSC for Block 21 intended to remove
caducidad from the scope of the US-Ecuador BIT because the contract was executed after the
Treaty was signed. Indeed, while the Treaty was signed on 27 August 1993, the PSC for Block
21 was signed on 20 March 1995, — but only entered into force on 11 May 1997, after the
execution of the PSC. At any rate, the conclusion that clause 20.2.20 of the PSC for Block 21
does not remove caducidad from the scope of the Treaty is unaffected by this chronology.

2.3. Are the allegations based on the caducidad decrees admissible?

Ecuador argues that Burlington's allegations relating to caducidad are premature
because Burlington has not challenged the caducidad decrees before the Ecuadorian
administrative courts. It notes that, whereas Burlington was not required to exhaust
local remedies before commencing this arbitration, it was required to make a
reasonable attempt to seek redress before domestic courts. Hence, Burlington's
allegation relating to the caducidad decrees is inadmissible. Although Burlington has
not specifically answered this objection, its argumentation shows that it opposes it. The
Tribunal will thus address it on the basis of Ecuador's arguments and other relevant
elements in the record.

In the Supplemental Memorial on Liability, Burlington made the following allegations in
relation to the caducidad decrees:

"On September 28, 2009, PetroEcuador petitioned the Minister of
Non-Renewable Natural Resources to terminate the PSCs for Blocks
7 and 21. PetroEcuador took the position that the Consortium had
abandoned the Blocks 7 and 21 operations and that this was sufficient
cause to terminate the PSCs under the Hydrocarbons Legal
Framework. Perenco, on behalf of the Consortium, immediately
objected _to the initiation of the caducidad process, because the
determination of the legality of Law No. 2006-42 payments and the
physical occupation of Blocks 7 and 21 were pending before the
Burlington and Perenco tribunals"? (emphasis added).

Ecuador has not disputed these allegations. It therefore appears that Perenco
“immediately objected to the initiation of the caducidad process" and that it did so "on
behalf of the Consortium." In fact, Ecuador has expressly admitted that, as the
operator of the Block, Perenco was contractually bound to "deal with the government"
on behalf of the Consortium.“ Hence, Perenco's objection to the caducidad process
was raised on behalf of both Consortium partners, including Burlington Oriente. Under
the facts of this case, this constituted a reasonable enough attempt to seek local
redress. Thus, the Tribunal sees no reason to declare Burlington's allegations relating
to the caducidad decrees inadmissible.

CSM, 4177.

“[T]here is a specific provision saying very clearly that only the operator should deal with the
government. So the operator of this Consortium, as you know, Members of the Tribunal, was
Perenco. This is a simple application of a contractual provision." Tr. 1349:18-22; see also
RPHB, $202.

C. EXPROPRIATION

254. The Tribunal must now address the merits of the claim over which it has jurisdiction,

the expropriation claim. The nub of Burlington's case is that each of Ecuador's

494 (the Law 42 tax, the coactiva seizures and the takeover of the

measures individually
Blocks) and all of them collectively constituted an unlawful expropriation of its
investment. Ecuador denies that any of these measures expropriated Burlington's
investment, whether considered individually or collectively. In the alternative, Ecuador
argues that, if there was expropriation, it was lawful under the circumstances.

255. The Treaty contains the following provision on expropriation:

"Article Ill

1. Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either
directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to
expropriation or nationalization ("expropriation") except: for a
public purpose; in a non-discriminatory manner; upon payment of
prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and in accordance
with due process of law and the general principles of treatment
provided for in Article II (3) [transcribed below]. Compensation
shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated
investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken
or became known, whichever is earlier; be calculated in a freely
usable currency on the basis of the prevailing market rate of
exchange at that time; be paid without delay; include interest at a
commercially reasonable rate from the date of expropriation; be
fully realizable and be freely transferable."“°°

Article II (3) to which Article Ill refers reads as follows:
“Article Il

3. (a) Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable
treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no
case be accorded treatment less than that required by
international law.

(b) Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or
discriminatory measures the management, operation,
maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal
of investments. For purposes of dispute resolution under Articles
VI and Vil, a measure may be arbitrary or discriminatory
notwithstanding the fact that a party has had or has exercised the
opportunity to review such measure in the courts or administrative
tribunals of a Party.

Specifically, Burlington measure-by-measure case is that the Law 42 tax (at both 50% and 99%)
constituted an indirect expropriation of its investment ("a measure tantamount to expropriation"
(CSM, § 82)); and that the coactiva seizures and the physical takeover of the Blocks constituted
a direct expropriation of its investment ("a direct confiscation", "a direct taking" and "a direct
expropriation"; CSM, 9 90, 91 and 94).

The Treaty at Article Ill (Exh. C-6).

90

256.

257.

258.

(c) Each Party shall observe any. obligation it may have entered

into with regard to investments."
The Treaty thus establishes a general prohibition against expropriation of investments
unless certain specified requirements are cumulatively met, in which case the
expropriation is lawful. In order to adjudicate Burlington's expropriation claim, the
Tribunal must first determine what Burlington's investment was (Section 1) and in
particular what rights Burlington had under the PSCs (Section 2). In so doing, the
Tribunal does not act as a contract judge but exclusively as a treaty judge, addressing
contract matters as preliminary issues insofar as it is necessary to rule on a Treaty
claim. Subsequently, the Tribunal's task will be to decide whether Ecuador
expropriated Burlington's investment (Section 3) and, if there was expropriation,
whether the expropriation was unlawful (Section 4).

1. Burlington's Investment in Ecuador

The Treaty provides that "investments shall not be expropriated." The Tribunal
understands from this formulation that the focus of the expropriation analysis must be
on the investment as a whole, and not on discrete parts of the investment. Other
international tribunals have adopted the same approach. The tribunal in Telenor v.
Hungary, for instance, stated that in the context of a claim for expropriation "the
investment must be viewed as a whole [...]."“°’ Likewise, the tribunal in Merrill v.
Canada noted that "the business of the investor has to be considered as a
whole [...]."“°8 In the same vein, the tribunal in Feldman v. Mexico held that a State
measure that effectively extinguished an entire line of the investor's business —
cigarette exports — did not amount to an expropriation of its investment as a whole.“

The Parties seem, however, to have focused on a narrower view of investment. In its
initial Memorial, for instance, Burlington alleged that Ecuador's measures had injured
its "investments" in Ecuador, defining these "investments" as the "rights in the four
contracts [at the time the PSCs for Blocks 23 and 24 were still part of the dispute] for
the exploration and exploitation of crude reserves in Ecuador."*"° Burlington claimed to

possess those rights "[t]hrough its ownership of [Burlington Oriente]."*"'

Hence,
according to Burlington, the rights under the PSCs constituted in and of themselves the
investment. Consistent with this submission, counsel for Burlington expressed the

following view at the hearing:

"Well, surely the nexus between the PSCs and Burlington's investment
is undeniable: Not only were the PSCs linked to Burlington's

investments, no, they were Burlington's investments"*"? (emphasis
added).

Ecuador neither explicitly accepted Burlington's definition of investment, nor did it
challenge it as unduly narrow but it made its arguments within the framework of that
definition. For instance, in its Counter-Memorial on Liability, Ecuador submitted that
the Law 42 tax did not expropriate Burlington's investment because it was not in breach
of the PSCs, noting at the same time that "the investment Burlington alleges is
precisely the value of those contract rights".*"*

Nevertheless, in line with the cases referred to above, the Tribunal considers that a
broader view of investment must be adopted, a view that encompasses Burlington's
investment "as a whole." Burlington's investment is not composed solely of the rights
of its subsidiary under the PSCs, even if those rights constituted the most valuable
portion of Burlington's investment. Burlington's investment included its shares in
Burlington Oriente, the infrastructure and equipment employed to exploit oil reserves,
any other tangible property related to the project, the monetary and asset contributions

made to carry out its operations, and the physical possession of the Blocks.*"*

2. The Rights under the PSCs

Without being per se investments, the contract rights under the PSCs represented a
key component of Burlington's investment. It is by virtue of these contract rights that,
through its subsidiary, Burlington had access to a share of the oil produced. These
contract rights have a direct incidence on the economic value of Burlington's

Mem., ¥ 303.

Tr. 145:17-20. Admittedly, Burlington also invoked its rights derived from the Hydrocarbons
Legal Framework. However, as the Tribunal previously concluded, the Hydrocarbons Legal
Framework contains no existing "obligation" (see supra, Section 1V(B)(1.2)).

RCM, 7501.

The Tribunal finds its understanding confirmed by other decisions, such as Saipem S.p.A v.
Bangladesh, (hereinafter “Saipem’), Decision on Jurisdiction of 21 March 2007, 4 31 (Ex. CL-
14) and the very first ICSID Decision on Jurisdiction of 12 May 1974 in Holidays Inns v.
Morocco, reported in Pierre Lalive, The First ‘World Bank’ Arbitration (Holiday Inns v. Morocco’),

CL-137).

investment. For this reason, the Parties have devoted considerable attention to the
identification of Burlington's rights under the PSCs. Thus, the Tribunal will start by
identifying the rights which the PSCs conferred upon Burlington's subsidiary.

The disagreement of the Parties with respect to the meaning of the PSCs is confined to
two main issues. First, the Parties disagree on the meaning of the term "economy" of
the PSC, a term of crucial importance to understand the economic bargain at the heart
of the contracts. Second, under the assumption that the economy of the PSC is
affected by a given State measure, they disagree on whether the application of the so-
called "correction factor" to re-establish the economy is mandatory or not.

2.1. Burlington's position

Burlington claims (i) that it had the contractual right to receive the full economic value
of its oil production share regardless of the price of oil, and (ii) that if the economy of
the PSCs was affected, the parties were bound to apply a correction factor..

First, Burlington claims that under the PSCs it had a right to enjoy the upside of any
price increase. Otherwise stated, it claims that it had the right to realize the full
economic value of its oil production share without regard to the price of oil — and
subject only to the employment contributions and income tax agreed upon in the
PSCs.“"® Contrary to what Ecuador argues, the participation formulas were not based
on the price of oil. The participation formulas were subject to change solely on the
basis of increased oil production, quality of the oil, or changes in the tax system. By
contrast, the participation formulas were not subject to change because of oil price
increases. As counsel for Burlington indicated at the hearing:

"So, these [participation] percentages would change, amongst other
things, with regard to the application of new taxes or with regard to
volume [or quality*"*], but nowhere is any mention made of price as a
factor to determine such [oil] share.

And_consistently, Burlington and the State never agreed that the
State's participation would change as the price of oil increased. That
was simply part of the risk and reward of the original terms of the
Contract. [...] This is entirely consistent with industry practice. Price is
not normally included as a factor to determine production share in
PSCs. Essentially price is one of the elements of risk and reward that
the oil companies insist is not part of any kind of limitation" (emphasis
added).*"”

CSM, 419.
“[T]here may be an adjustment [of the oil share] for the quality of the crude found — that's
another aspect" (Tr. 24:8-9).

Tr. 24:17-25:15.

93

265.

266.

267.

268.

269.

As a result, Burlington's income was not fixed but entirely contingent on the price of oil.
If the price of oil increased, Burlington was entitled to the higher revenues resulting
from such increase. There was no mathematical-economic equation included in the
PSCs:

"(T]he agreed, fixed equilibrium of the PSCs defined by a
mathematical formula simply does not exist. These were risk
contracts, which are at odds with any concept of fixed equilibrium, let
alone a fixed (therefore guaranteed) rate of return."*"®
The participation formulas constituted the entire agreement between the parties, with

each party entitled to realize the full economic value of its oil share regardless of price:
"[T]he PSCs struck a particular balance between [Ecuador] and
private investors, with those investors carrying the risk associated with
developing the projects, but also enjoying any potential upside

regarding price (and, at the same time, suffering from any
downside)."*"°

In sum, for Burlington, the economy of the PSCs meant that it was entitled to realize
the full economic value of its oil production share without regard to the price of oil, and
subject only to those income and other taxes specifically provided for in the PSCs.

Second, if a tax measure affected the economy of the PSCs, the parties were under an
obligation to apply a correction factor that would absorb the effects of the tax. This
followed from the language of the PSCs. The contracts stated that "if a triggering event
occurs, a correction factor will be included."*° The terms "will be included" implied that
the application of a correction factor was mandatory, and not, as argued by Ecuador,
merely subject to renegotiation. Thus, the PSCs contained tax stabilization provisions.

2.2. Ecuador's position

According to Ecuador, (i) the term economy of the PSCs meant that Burlington only
had the right to the price projections upon which the original parties to the PSCs had
allocated oil production, that is a price of USD 15 per barrel and a resultant IRR of
15%; and (ii) even assuming that the economy of the PSCs was affected, the contracts
merely imposed upon the parties an obligation to renegotiate a correction factor, there
being no mandatory adjustment of the parties' participations nor tax stabilization
clauses.

422

First, Burlington had no right to windfall profits under the PSCs and thus no right to
extraordinary profits resulting from unexpectedly high prices. The PSCs merely
allocated oil production volumes between Ecuador and the contractor. This oil
allocation was based on the so-called "Vega model", a precise mathematical-economic
equation upon which the economy of the PSCs was calculated. In other words, the oil
participation percentages were but a reflection of the Vega model calculations on the
date of conclusion of the PSCs.“*"

Under the Vega model, the contractor's income ("R") was calculated on the basis of the
following three variables: the production of the Block ("Q"); the contractor's participation
percentage ("X"); and the oil price projections estimated over the life of the contract
("P"). In short: R = Q x X x P. Once the contractor's income was calculated, it was
possible to determine the internal rate of return ("IRR") by factoring in costs,
employment contribution and income tax.‘

The PSCs were based on an oil price projection of USD 15 per barrel, and an IRR of
15%. The price projection based on a price per barrel of USD 15 is part of the Vega
model formula. The application of this formula would then yield an IRR of 15% for the
contractor. Hence, these two key considerations — the oil price projections and the
contractor's IRR — were incorporated in the calculation of the contractor's oil
participation share. Moreover, in the case of Block 7, the parties' oil price projections
over the life of the contract were reflected in Annex V of the PSC. At the hearing,
counsel for Ecuador stated:

"The equation [the Vega model] in the contracts factors among other
things the reserves figures and production profile, how much it would
cost to get those reserves [from] the ground, revenues — and this is
the important part. | was telling you before we would get to speak
about revenues — here we are — the revenues that the Parties
considered in negotiating this agreement were based on a projection
of a price per barrel of $15. This projection, along with the other
projections, resulted in an internal rate of return for the Contractor of
about 15 percent, and | say about 15 percent because, depending on
the Contracts and the risk involved, the figure was more or less
around 15.

 

Well, as we know, the assumption at the time of contracting was that
as long as the price per barrel remained at or around $15 a barrel,
obviously adjusted for inflation [...] the Contractor would be able to
recover its costs and make a reasonable profit on the basis of an

95

273.

275.

276.

internal rate of return of 15 percent throughout the life of the

Contract."“8
In sum, Burlington had no contractual right to revenues stemming from oil prices in
excess of the parties’ price assumptions at the time the PSCs were executed, i.e. in
excess of an inflation-adjusted USD 15 per barrel. The economy of the PSCs meant
that Burlington only had the right to USD 15 per barrel, which would yield an internal
rate of return of 15% — anything above this oil price was a windfall profit not envisaged
by the contracting parties.

Second, even assuming that the economy of the PSCs were affected, the contracts
merely provided for renegotiation. The PSC for Block 7 states that any correction
factor "will be calculated by agreement of the Parties."*** The PSC for Block 21, in turn,
provides that any adjustment to the participation formulas "shall be approved by the

Administrative Council [...]."4*

It follows from such language that these are merely
renegotiation clauses. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to decide what the parties
would have agreed to pursuant to these clauses. In short, even if the economy of the
PSCs is affected, the contracts do not impose an obligation to apply a correction factor

but merely to renegotiate. *”°

2.3. Analysis

In light of the Parties' positions, the Tribunal must determine (a) what the economy of
the PSCs was, and (b) whether the tax modification clauses calling for the application
of a correction factor are mandatory or not, i.e. whether they are tax stabilization or
renegotiation clauses.

2.3.1. The economy of the PSCs

In order to determine what the economy of the PSCs was, the Tribunal will analyze (a)
the letter of the PSCs; (b) Annex V of the PSC for Block 7; (c) the Tarapoa contract; (d)
Ecuador's conduct; (e) Ecuador's Hydrocarbons Law; and (f) the purpose of the shift
from service contracts to production sharing contracts.

a. The letter of the PSCs

277. Clause 8.1 of the PSC for Block 7 provides the following in respect of the calculation of

the contractor's oil production share:

"Calculation of the Contractor's Production Share:
The Contractor's share will be calculated using the following formula:

pc=x.aQ@
100

Where:

PC = Contractor's Production Share

Q = Measured Production

X = Average factor, expressed as a percentage rounded to the third

decimal place, corresponding to the Contractor's Share of Production.
[...J"*”* (emphasis added).

278. Likewise, Clause 8.1 of the PSC for Block 21 sets forth the following:

"Calculation of the Contractor's Share of Production:

The Contractor's share will be calculated pursuant to the parameters
agreed to in this Contract, in accordance with the following formula:
Pc=x.Q*?

Where:

PC = Contractor's Share of Production

Q = Inspected annual production in the Contract Area

X = average factor, as a percentage, corresponding to the Contractor's
share of production [...].""*° (emphasis added).

279. For Ecuador, the contractor's production share is to be calculated in accordance with

the following formula: PC = X x Q x P, where "X" (contractor's share of production in
percentage terms) and "Q" (total measured production) coincide with the definitions of
clauses 8.1 transcribed above. In addition, Ecuador argues that the contractor's share
of production includes the "P" factor, i.e. the oil price projections estimated over the life
of the contract, which would yield an IRR of 15%. However, there is no mention of any

283.

such "P" factor in clauses 8.1 of the PSCs. Similarly, these clauses do not mention any
link between the formula for calculating the contractor's production share and the
purported IRR.

More generally, the formula "PC = X x Q x P"— or the Vega model — appears nowhere
in the PSCs (subject to Annex V of the PSC for Block 7 which will be examined
separately), nor is there any mention of the contractor's purported IRR anywhere in the
PSCs. This is telling, especially considering how detailed and lengthy the PSCs are.
Without counting authorizations and annexes, the PSC for Block 7 contains over 120
pages, and the PSC for Block 21 over 80 pages. If authorizations and annexes are
included, both contracts run into the several hundreds of pages — over 400 pages for
the PSC for Block 7 and over 600 pages for the PSC for Block 21. In these
circumstances, it is hard to conceive how the original parties to the contract would have
left unstated such pivotal aspect of the PSCs, had they intended to include it.

Accordingly, the letter of the PSCs suggests that the economy of the PSCs was linked
neither to a price assumption of USD 15 per barrel nor to an IRR of 15%. Instead, it
tends to show that the contractor was entitled to the economic value of its oil
participation share irrespective of the price of oil or of the contractor's internal rate of
return — subject to the contract's tax provisions examined below.

b. Annex V of the PSC for Block 7

Ecuador argues that Annex V of the PSC for Block 7 contains the mathematical-
economic equation upon which the original parties to the contract purportedly
determined the contractor's oil production share, i.e. the so-called Vega model. In
accordance with clause 24.2,“°' Annex V is an integral part of the PSC. Ecuador points
in particular to Tables 15, 22 and 27 A of Annex V.“* At the hearing, counsel for
Ecuador stated as follows:

"(T]he economy [of the PSCs] referred to the mathematical and
economic equation agreed at the time of the Contract, and you will
find such equation, for example, at Annex V of the Block 7
Participation Contract [...]. Well, | think the Contract [for Block 7] is
both the text [...] but also its Annexes [...], so | would invite you to
keep an eye on Annex V [...]."4%°

The Tribunal will examine the purpose of Annex V, whether there is evidence of the

Vega Model in Annex V, and whether the notion of the economy of the PSC

284.

285.

purportedly arising from Annex V is consistent with the other elements on record,
particularly with Law 42.

First, Annex V is an internal memorandum from Ecuador's Negotiation Commission for
the modification of the Block 7 PSC (the "Negotiation Commission") to the President
and the Board of Directors of PetroEcuador, dated 3 November 1999. Block 7 was
subject to a service contract and thus, unlike blocks such as Block 21, was not part of
an international bidding process. At the hearing, counsel for Burlington offered the
following explanation in this respect:

"[T]here needs to be some kind of review by the State as best they
can at that moment to work out whether or not it's in the interest of the
State to make that migration [to the PSC]. So, Article 10 [of the
Hydrocarbons Law] stated, if it's convenient to the interests of the
State, the contracts for the exploration and exploitation of
hydrocarbons may be modified by agreement of the Contracting
Parties. [...] Annex V is simply the memorandum to the PetroEcuador

board [which] provides the basis for the approval of the new [PSC]

Contract"** (emphasis added).
This explanation finds support in the letter of Annex V and in Article 10 of the
Hydrocarbons Law.**® Indeed, the Negotiation Commission concluded that, in
accordance with Article 10 of the Hydrocarbons Law, modifying the Block 7 service
contract into a PSC would "suit the interests of the State."*° On this basis, the
Commission recommended to the President and the Board of PetroEcuador, the
addressees of the internal memorandum, to approve the modification of the Block 7
service contract into a PSC if they "deem[ed] it appropriate."“*” Hence, Annex V was
not intended to set out the terms of the prospective PSC, but merely to establish
whether it would be in Ecuador's interest to enter into a PSC in lieu of a service
contract from an economic standpoint.

. In order to determine whether a PSC was in Ecuador's interest, the Negotiation

Commission sought to determine whether the value of a PSC, on a net present value
basis, was greater than that of a service contract. To carry out this calculation, it had to
assume the price of oil over the life of the contract, expected to run from 2000 to 2010.
It used a price assumption of USD 15 per barrel, which explains the price of USD 15
per barrel in Tables 15, 22 and 27 A, upon which Ecuador has focused. Under this
price assumption, it concluded that the net present value of a PSC would be greater

290.

than that of a service contract for Ecuador, whereas the net present value would be the
same for the contractor.“ The price of USD 15 per barrel was thus used to assess
whether the modification of the Block 7 services contract was in Ecuador's interest —
not to determine the Contractor's participation share or its IRR.

Second, there appears to be no evidence of the Vega Model in Annex V. While the
Commission used a price assumption of USD 15 per barrel, there is no evidence that
this assumption was applied in connection with the Vega Model. As seen above, under
the Vega Model, the contractor's participation share is based on its percentage ("X") of
total oil production ("Q") under a specific price assumption ("P"). However, Annex V
contains no evidence linking "P" to "Q" or to the contractor's participation share. There
is likewise no formula similar to that of clause 8.1 of the contract (PC = X x Q/100) that
would suggest a connection between the contractor's participation share and the
Commission's price assumption of USD 15 per barrel.

On the contrary, Annex V contains indications that the contractor's participation share
was not linked to the price of oil. As part of its description of the negotiation with the
contractor, the Negotiation Commission states:

"As an alternative, it was proposed that an average of USD 17 per

barrel be set, with the parties equitably sharing the surplus at 50%
each, This proposal was not accepted by the [contractor] either
LJ"

From the Negotiation Commission's memorandum, it appears that the original parties
to the contract specifically discussed the possibility of sharing equally the oil revenues
in case the price of oil were to exceed USD 17 per barrel. However, Annex V suggests
that the contractor rejected this proposal. The fact that no agreement to this effect was
reproduced in the PSC for Block 7 that was concluded about five months after the date
of the Annex V suggests that parties did not reconsider this matter, or, if they did,
reached no agreement on sharing excess profits.““° In conclusion, Annex V contains
no evidence of the Vega Model. On the contrary, it shows that the contractor's
participation share was not linked to the price of oil.

Third, the economy of the PSC for Block 7 as it allegedly results from Annex V appears
inconsistent with the remaining evidence on record as to how the economy of the PSCs
is to be ascertained. Under Annex V, the economy of the PSC for Block 7 would be

The Annex V memorandum is dated 3 November 1999. The PSC for Block 7 was concluded on
23 March 2000 - that is, nearly five months after the date of the Annex V memorandum.

tied to a price of USD 15 per barrel. At the same time, Ecuador has argued that the
economy of the PSCs was determined on the date of execution. In the words of
counsel for Ecuador:

"Well, Ecuador's submission, Members of the Tribunal, is that the

starting point [...] in this case is the economy of the participation

contracts as defined on the date of their execution.

[el

[Ecuador's witnesses] all established very clearly that the economy of
the Participation Contract — and it couldn't be otherwise — is to be

established on the date of execution of the Participation Contract"*”
(emphasis added).

On the date when the PSC for Block 7 was executed i.e., on 23 March 2000, the price
of Block 7 oil was USD 25.11 per barrel. In keeping with Ecuador's submission, Law
42 also operates on the basis that the relevant price is the one on the date of
execution. This is why Law 42 regards as "extraordinary" only those revenues
resulting from oil prices in excess of the price of oil on the date the PSCs were
executed. As counsel for Ecuador stated:

"Law 42 takes the price of oil from the market at the time of execution
of the Participation Contracts and the dinary above
that price as corrected by the inflation pursuant to American figures, is
to be allocated between the State and the Contractor.

[el

[T]he Law 42 [reference] price was always above the $15 a barrel
price agreed to define the economy of the participation contracts. In
fact [...] the [reference] price for Block 7 was $25.11 as of March 2000
= that is. the date of execution of the Block 7 Participation Contract
[...]" (emphasis added).

 

 

Therefore, there would be two different ways to ascertain the economy of the PSC for
Block 7: one based on Annex V, with a price of USD 15, and the other one based on
the date of execution of the PSC, with a price of about USD 25. In other words, the
economy of the contract purportedly arising from Annex V is inconsistent with
Ecuador's submission that the economy of the PSCs is determined on the date of
execution, which is the basis upon which Law 42 operates. These inconsistencies
reinforce the previous conclusions that Annex V contains no evidence of the Vega
model.

In summary, Annex V does not show that the economy of the PSC for Block 7 was a
function of either a price projection of USD 15/bbl or a 15% internal rate of return for
the contractor. Thus, Annex V does not appear to set a limit on the revenues that the
contractor could derive from its oil participation share.

c. The Tarapoa Contract

On 25 July 1995, Ecuador and City Investing Company concluded a PSC for the
exploration and exploitation of the Tarapoa Block. Under clause 8.1 of the so-called
Tarapoa Contract, the contractor's participation share is a function of its percentage
("X") over total oil production ("Q"). The Tarapoa Contract is thus premised on the
participation formula "PC = X.Q", as were the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21. Yet, at the
end of clause 8.1, the Tarapoa Contract adds the following:

"If the price of crude oil in the Block exceeds USD 17 per barrel, the

surplus of the benefit brought about by the price increase in real terms

(calculated at constant values of [1995]) will be distributed between

the Parties in equal shares."*“*
This language creates a link between the economic benefits the contractor may draw
from the contract and the price of oil. If the price of oil exceeds USD 17 per barrel, the
additional revenues are apportioned between Ecuador and the contractor on a 50/50
basis. This apportionment does not affect the contractor's participation share in terms
of oil volumes, but it does affect the economic benefits the contractor may draw from
that share by conferring on the State half of the revenues stemming from oil prices in
excess of USD 17 per barrel. No such Tarapoa-like clause was included in the PSCs
for Blocks 7 and 21. This is particularly enlightening if one remembers that the PSC for
Block 21 and the Tarapoa Contract were negotiated at the same time.“

Christian Davalos represented Ecuador in the contemporaneous negotiations of
hydrocarbons PSCs for the Tarapoa Block and Block 21. On cross-examination, Mr.
Davalos confirmed that the Tarapoa Contract contained a clause that adjusted the
allocation of oil revenues when the price of oil exceeded the USD 17 per barrel
threshold:

"[Mr Blackaby]: And you [...] said that a [price adjustment] clause
had been included in the Tarapoa Contract; correct?

[Mr Davalos]: | mentioned that the Tarapoa contract was being
negotiated at the same time [as Block 21], and that [in] the Tarapoa
Contract, at the request of the Contractor, the possibility was included
for the price to be over the price that was being negotiated [as] the

["economy"] of the Contract. [...] They [the contractors] had agreed on
$17 [per barrel as] the ["economy’] of the Contract [...]. So, over [USD’
17 [per barrel], they [the contractors] said okay, you can include
whatever you want, and so it was decided that this be done on a
50/50 basis, this in the Tarapoa Contract"*® (emphasis added).

At the same time, Mr. Davalos acknowledged on cross-examination that, despite his
own suggestion during the contract negotiations, no Tarapoa-like price adjustment
clause was included in the PSC for Block 21:

"[Mr Blackaby]: When you were involved in the negotiation of Block
21, you suggested the possibility of including in the Contract a clause
to have a share for the State in the event that the price of crude oil
rose to 17 or $18 a barrel; correct?

[Mr Davalos]: Yes, sir.

 

[Mr y]: So, in the Block 21 Contract, the negotiating group
rejected your idea of including that clause in Block 21.

[Mr Davalos]: Yes [...] They [the contractors] said let's not talk about
scenarios, scenarios that will only be scenarios"“”” (emphasis added).

. By the same token, Mr. Vega, who negotiated the Block 7 PSC on behalf of Ecuador,

conceded on cross-examination that, despite his suggestion in the course of the
contract negotiations, no Tarapoa-like clause was included in the PSC for Block 7:

"[Mr Blackaby]: You suggested, in the context of Block 7, that a
correction clause be included based on the price.

[Mr Vega]: Yes, that's right.

[Mr y]: But at the end of the day, that wasn't done in Block 7.
It was rejected by the Contractor.

[Mr Vega]: Yes, that's right" (emphasis added).

448

 

. These exchanges lend support to the following two propositions. First, while the

Tarapoa Contract parties accepted a clause linking the distribution of oil revenues to
the price of oil, the Block 7 and 21 contract parties did not accept such a clause.
Second, the possibility of linking the distribution of oil revenues to oil prices was
specifically discussed during the negotiations for the Block 7 and 21 PSCs. On the
basis of these premises, it is safe to conclude that the non-inclusion of a Tarapoa-like
clause in the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 was not the product of inadvertence but a
deliberate choice of the contracting parties.

As the product of a deliberate choice, the non-inclusion of an adjustment clause in the
PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 suggests that the economy of the contracts was not a
function of either oil price projections or of a specific IRR. By contrast, this choice

303.

suggests that the economy of the contract was one where the contractor was entitled to
the economic value of its oil participation share without regard to either the price of oil
or its IRR.

d. — Ecuador's conduct

Ecuador's conduct may also help to elucidate the meaning of the economy of the
PSCs. The Tribunal will focus its attention on Ecuador's initial requests to renegotiate
the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21; the deliberations relating to the passage of Law 42; and
the reaction to Burlington's requests for adjustment of the "X" factors following the
enactment of Law 42 and Decree 662.

First, Ecuador invited Burlington to renegotiate the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 in
November 2005.“° It alleges that, through these renegotiations, it intended to restore
the economic equilibrium of the PSCs. However, there is no indication that Ecuador
relied on the PSCs in these renegotiations or that it invoked clause 8.1 of the PSCs,
which allegedly reflected the price projections upon which the parties allocated the
petroleum rent.“ This suggests that Ecuador did not believe at that time in the notion
of economy of the PSCs it now propounds.

Second, following the failure of these renegotiations, the then President of Ecuador,
Palacio Gonzalez, submitted to the Ecuadorian Congress a bill that eventually became
Law 42. In the course of the legislative deliberations relating to this bill, an Ecuadorian
congressman expressed:

"What does this clause [from the Tarapoa PSC] say? 'If the price of
crude oil in the Block exceeds USD 17 per barrel, the surplus of the
benefit brought about by the price increase in real terms, calculated at
constant values of 1995, will be distributed between the parties in
equal shares.’ Look, it’s as if it were copied, that is the proposal that
the Government is making, what is already envisaged in one contract
[the Tarapoa contract], and we want that this, which is already
envisaged in one contract, be incorporated in the rest of the

contracts" (emphasis added).

 

 

. Ata later stage of the deliberations, another Ecuadorian congressman added:

Exh. C-173.

Ecuador alleged that the oil price projections that the parties would have taken into account to
allocate the petroleum rent are "reflected in the participation percentages in clauses 8 of the
Participation Contracts" (RPHB, {| 43). Likewise, Ecuador maintained that the "economy of the
Participation Contracts is reflected in the participation percentages in Clause 8" (internal
quotations omitted) (/d., at § 73). In the same vein, Ecuador stated that the economy of the
PSCs "includes the internal rate of return for the contractor and translates into the participation
percentages" of clause 8 (/d., at § 105).

Exh. C-177, p. 73 (Tribunal’s translation).

104

305.

306.

307.

308.

"By virtue of this Law [42] various [oil] contracts were renegotiated.
One of the contracts that was renegotiated in the first place was [that
of] the Tarapoa block, and that renegotiation was so well done that it
included [the clause] that the [first congressman] read out, by which,
when the barrel of oil exceeds USD 17, [the revenues] are shared
between the State and the contractor on a 50/50 basis. Then there
were other renegotiations [...], and in those renegotiations, strangely,
the clause that exists in the [Tarapoa] contract was not included. Now,
faced with the bill sent by the President of the Republic, we have
discussed whether or not we can by law_unilaterally modify oil

contracts with retroactive effect. That_and_no other is the legal

issue" “~" (emphasis added).
By calling attention to this congressional debate, the Tribunal does not intend to
attribute responsibility to Ecuador for the statements of individual congressmen.
However, in the overall assessment of the facts and the evidence on record, these
statements shed light on the manner in which at least some members of Congress
understood the context leading to the enactment of Law 42. The understanding of
these congressmen was not that Law 42 gave effect to the terms of the PSCs. On the
contrary, these congressmen were aware that Law 42 would modify the PSCs which
included no Tarapoa-like clause like those of Blocks 7 and 21.

Third, Burlington requested from Ecuador an upward readjustment of its participation
share, or X factor, following the enactment of Law 42 and Decree 662.“ Ecuador did
not respond to these requests, allegedly because Burlington had failed to submit the
economic studies required for such readjustment.“ Yet, had Ecuador believed that
Burlington had no right to a readjustment, it could simply have responded by stating as
much. Ecuador's failure to give any answer to Burlington tends to demonstrate once
again that Ecuador did not at the time embrace the notion of economy of the PSCs
which it now advocates.

In sum, Ecuador's actions and omissions reveal that it did not believe in the notion of
economy of the PSCs it has proffered in this arbitration. This intimates that the
economy of the PSCs was not based either upon a price assumption of USD 15/bbl or
upon an IRR of 15% for the contractor.

e. Ecuador's Hydrocarbons Law

As concluded in the discussion of the umbrella clause obligations, Ecuador's
Hydrocarbons Law contains no surviving obligation upon which Burlington may directly
rely. This does not mean, however, that it is wholly without relevance in order to

ascertain the scope of the contract obligations. Indeed, as Ecuador itself noted, the
PSCs reproduced some of the provisions of the Hydrocarbons Law on which Burlington
relies. Thus, these legal provisions may shed light on the meaning of the contract by
the very reason that they were to be replicated in the PSCs. Specifically, the
Hydrocarbons Law may serve to establish the meaning of the "economy" of the

contracts in the tax modification clauses.

Article 4 of Law No. 1993-44, which according to Ecuador contains the "legal definition

of participation contracts",“° provides the following:

"Once production is initiated, the contractor will have the right to a

share of production in the contract area, which will be calculated in

accordance with the production shares offered and agreed-upon

therein, based upon the volume of hydrocarbons produced. This

share, valued at the selling price of hydrocarbons in the contract area,

which in no case will be lower than the reference price, will constitute

the contractor's gross income, from which [the contractor] will make

deductions and pay income tax in accordance with the rules

envisaged in the Internal Tax System Law"*°° (emphasis added).
In accordance with this provision, the contractor's share of production constitutes its
"gross income."*®” According to Ecuador, the contractor's share under the PSCs would
be a function of oil price projections and a specific internal rate of return. The legal
provision just quoted contains, however, no indication that the gross income — the
equivalent of the oil participation shares — would be calculated on the basis of oil price
projections or a specific internal rate of return. These indications would have been
expected if they were to be replicated in the PSCs. Therefore, this provision of the
Hydrocarbons Law tends to confirm that the economy of the PSCs was not a function

of oil prices or an internal rate of return.

f. The purpose of the shift to production sharing contracts

In 1982, Ecuador introduced the so-called service contract model. Under this model,
Ecuador reimbursed oil companies for their costs and expenses and paid a service fee.
By 1993, however, the then President Duran Ballén submitted a bill to Congress where
he noted that "the current [service contract model] ... has exhausted its possibilities of

RCM, 9111.
Exh. C-15, p. 3 in the original pagination (Tribunal's translation).

Id. Ecuador has also argued that the PSCs did not "limit the deductions, contributions, or taxes
that could be levied or applied such as Law 42" (Tr. 254:1-3). It is common ground that Law 42
is part of Ecuador's "tax system" within the meaning of the tax modification clauses.
Accordingly, the Tribunal will address this argument in the context of its analysis of the tax
modification clauses (infra section 2.4).

attracting foreign capital." In support of this conclusion, the bill stated that, "[i]n the
last five years, no contract for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons has
been executed under the service contract model introduced by the reforms of 1982."*°°
The bill explained that the service contract model was on the decline for the following
three main reasons:

"[1] The evolution of the international conditions of the oil industry has
created more competitive models for attracting the ever scarcer
available capitals, such as for instance those that are being
implemented in the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union. [...]

[2] The Service Contract model [...] has become an extremely
complicated contract in terms of management and control. On the
other hand, the mandatory reimbursement provisions of the
contractor's investments, costs and expenses, has significantly
reduced the State's participation in the economic benefits of oil
exploration and exploitation in medium-sized and small blocks.

[3] Finally, the Service Contract model does not allow the contracting
company to have a production flow of its own. This feature militates
against the interest and raison d’étre of international oil companies, for
most of which it is essential to be able to market [oil] production in
international markets"™” (emphasis added).
With respect to the contractor's participation share, the bill, which would be passed into

law and amend the Hydrocarbons Law,** further noted that:

"With regard to the availability of production, the contractor will freely

dispose of the production percentage submitted in the bidding, so that

it_may be traded in the domestic or external market; but in no case

may the selling price be lower than the price PetroEcuador receives

for its external sales"“* (emphasis added).
While it is not for this Tribunal to judge what type of contract was preferable from a
policy standpoint or would have brought about a fairer allocation of the oil rent, it is its
role to determine the intent of the parties to the PSCs to the extent that such intent
plays a role for the resolution of this Treaty claim. One of the elements that may assist
in this determination concerns the reason why Ecuador abandoned the service contract
in favour of the PSC.

The purpose of the shift from the service contract model to the production sharing
model was, according to the text of the bill, to "allow Ecuador to position itself at an

internationally competitive level for attracting venture capital."“* It is difficult to see
how a PSC could be more attractive than a service contract, knowing that the former
imposes all costs, exploration and exploitation risks on the investor and the latter does
not, if both models set an apparently similar maximum limit on revenues — revenues
which are guaranteed under a service contract but not under a PSC.

For all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that the economy of the PSCs was not
a function of either a projected oil price of USD 15/bbl or of a contractor's IRR of 15%.
Rather, the economy of the PSCs entitled the contractor to receive its oil participation
share, dispose of it on the market irrespective of price, and thus to obtain its oil share's
market value — subject to the applicable taxes and to the contract provisions on new

taxes examined below.

2.3.2. The tax modification clauses

The Parties disagree on whether the tax modification clauses, which call for the
application of a correction factor when the economy of the contracts is affected, are
mandatory or not. Burlington claims that the tax modification clauses were mandatory
and, therefore, that they amounted to tax stabilization clauses. Ecuador contends that
the tax modification clauses were not mandatory and constituted mere renegotiation
clauses. The Tribunal will examine each PSC separately in order to determine whether
or not the application of a correction factor was mandatory.

a. The tax modification clause of the PSC for Block 7

The tax modification clause included in clause 11.12 of the PSC for Block 7 provides as
follows:

"Modification to the tax system: In the event of a modification to the
tax system or the creation or elimination of new taxes not foreseen in
this Contract or of the employment contribution, in force at the time of
the execution of this Contract and as set out in this Clause, which
have an impact on the economics of this Contract, a correction factor
will be included in the production sharing percentages to absorb the
impact of the increase or d in the tax or in the employment
contribution burden. This correction factor will be calculated between
the Parties and will be subject to the procedure set forth in Article
thirty-one (31) of the Regulations for Application of the Law Reforming
the Hydrocarbons Law"** (emphasis added).

 

 

 

This clause must be interpreted in conjunction with clauses 8.6 and 15.2 of the
Contract. Clause 8.6 states:

Supra 411.

108

319.

320.

321.

322.

"Economic stability: In the event that, by the action of the Ecuadorian
State or PetroEcuador, any of the events described below were to

occur and have _an impact _on the economy of this Contract, a
correction factor will be applied to the production sharing percentages
in order to absorb the increase or decrease in the economic burden:

a) Modification of the tax system as described in clause [11.12] [...]"
(emphasis added).

Clause 15.2 in turn provides that:

"Contract amendments: There shall be negotiation and execution of

contract amendments, with prior agreement of the Parties, particularly

in the following cases:[...] c) When the tax system [...] applicable to

this type of Contract in the country is modified, in order to restore the

economy of the Contract_in accordance with clause [11.12°"]"

(emphasis added).
In order to determine whether the application of a correction factor is mandatory or not,
the Tribunal will examine the language of these clauses, their purpose, and the
relevant provision of the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework which these clauses are

meant to replicate, that is, Article 16 of Decree No. 1417.

First, all the three provisions transcribed above contain mandatory language calling for
the parties to apply a correction factor in order to absorb the impact of a tax increase or
decrease on the economy of the Contract. Under clause 11.12, a correction factor will
be included if there is a modification to the tax system which has an impact on the
economy of the Contract; under clause 8.6, a correction factor will apply if there is a
modification to the tax system which has an impact on the economy of the Contract;
under clause 15.2, if there is a modification to the tax system, the parties shall
negotiate and execute a contract amendment with a view to re-establishing the
economy of the Contract. Those formulations show that the application of a correction
factor is not optional. In the event of a modification to the tax system impacting the
economy of the Contract, there must be a correction.

At the same time, both parties to the PSC are to agree on the implementation of this
correction factor. According to clause 11.12, the correction factor "will be calculated
between the Parties." According to clause 15.2(c), a contract amendment for the
application of such correction factor shall be negotiated and executed "with prior

Id., at clause 8.6 (Tribunal’s translation).

Clause 15.2(c) in fact refers to clause 11.11 — not to clause 11.12. As Ecuador's reliance on
this clause indicates, this is a mistake. Clause 11.11 refers to the "amortization of investments"
and not to modifications to the tax system, which is what clause 15.2(c) addresses. Thus, it is
to be understood that the reference in clause 15.2(c) to clause 11.11 was intended to be a
reference to clause 11.12.

Exh. C-1, at clause 15.2 (Tribunals translation).

109

323.

324.

325.

agreement of the Parties." In the Tribunal's reading, this requirement does not make
the application of a correction factor optional. Otherwise, the content of the clause
would be inherently contradictory, with mandatory language being followed in short
order by contrary optional language.

The provision that the parties must jointly calculate the readjustment does not address
whether a correction factor will be applied. The contract already provides that such a
factor "will be included" for the purpose of absorbing the impact of the tax. Rather, this
provision assists in determining how the correction factor will be calculated. The
apparent purpose of this provision is to prevent a situation where a party unilaterally
imposes its computation of the share of oil production needed to offset the effect of a
tax increase or decrease, an admittedly complex calculation.“ This joint calculation
notwithstanding, the parties remain under an obligation to apply a correction factor that
will counterbalance the effects of a tax change on the economy of the contract.

Second, pursuant to the relevant clauses, the purpose of the correction factor is "to

"469 and "to restore the

absorb the impact of the increase or decrease in the tax
economy of the Contract."*”° The purpose is to avoid that tax increases or decreases
alter the economic foundation upon which the parties entered into the contract.‘”' This
purpose would be defeated if a party could simply refuse to apply a correction factor in
the event of a tax increase or decrease. Hence, the purpose of the tax modification
clause suggests that the parties intended the application of a correction factor to be

mandatory.

Finally, this interpretation finds confirmation in the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework. As
Ecuador itself recognizes,“” the tax modification clause of the PSCs reflects the
content of Article 16 of Decree No. 1417, which states:

"Economic stability: The parties' production shares in the contract area
will be adjusted when the tax system applicable to the contract has

At the hearing, counsel for Ecuador stated that "if the economy of the Participation Contract was
affected, the Parties need to negotiate, among others, how the different factors, X-factors in this
clause [8.1] should be adjusted. And as | said to you, these negotiations are very complex"
(emphasis added) (Tr. 261:13-17).

Exh. C-1, at clauses 11.2 and 8.6.

Id., at clause 15.2 (Tribunal's translation).

At the hearing, counsel for Burlington indicated that the right to a share of oil production "in itself
[] could be meaningless because if the State did not provide protection against changes in a tax
and royalty regime, the State could simply neutralize the income realizable from a share in
production at will" (Tr. 29:2-8).

been modified, in order to restore the economics of the contract in
place before the tax modification"*”* (emphasis added).

The language of this provision is also mandatory: the parties' oil production shares "will
be adjusted" in the event of a change in the tax system. And the purpose of the
adjustment is to "restore the economics of the contract in place before the tax
modification." Thus, Article 16 provides for a mandatory adjustment clause to be
inserted into production sharing contracts.

In sum, the Tribunal is of the view that the tax modification provision contained in
clause 11.12 of the PSC for Block 7 calls for the application of a mandatory correction
factor that absorbs any impact of a tax increase or decrease on the economy of the
Contract.

b. The tax modification clause of the PSC for Block 21

The tax modification clause of the PSC for Block 21

328.

329.

330.

331.

The tax modification clause of the PSC for Block 21 is set forth in clause 11.7:

"Modification to the tax system and to the employment contribution: In
the event of a modification to the tax system, the employment
contribution or its interpretation, which have an impact on the
economics of this Contract, a correction factor will be included in the
production sharing percentages to absorb the increase or decrease in
the tax. This adjustment will be approved by the Administrative Board
on the basis of a study that the Contractor will present to that effect”
(emphasis added).

In addition, clause 15.2 of the PSC for Block 21 provides as follows:

"Contract amendments: There shall be negotiation and execution of
contract amendments, with prior agreement of the Parties, particularly
in the following cases:[...] c) When the tax system [...] applicable to
this type of Contract in the country is modified, in order to restore the
economy of the Contract [...]"*”° (emphasis added).

 

As with the analysis of the tax modification clause in the PSC for Block 7, the Tribunal
will focus on the language, the purpose and the relevant part of the Hydrocarbons
Legal Framework.

First, clause 11.7, first sentence, provides that a correction factor "will be included" in
the event of a modification to the tax system. In addition, the second sentence of this
clause states that this adjustment "will be approved" by the Administrative Board ("the

Board"). This approval requirement means that the Board may verify and eventually
suggest modifications to the correction factor proposed by the contractor. However, the
Board has no discretion to refuse the application of a correction factor, which "will be
included." Clause 15.2, in turn, stipulates that a contract amendment "shall" be
negotiated and executed in order to restore the economy of the contract in the event of
a tax change. Like for the PSC for Block 7, this language suggests that the application
of a correction factor is mandatory.

Second, the purpose of the application of this correction factor is "to absorb the

increase or decrease in the tax"4”°

in order "to restore the economy of the Contract."*””
This purpose would be defeated if a party could simply refuse to apply a correction
factor. While the computations required for the application of the correction factor are
subject to the “prior agreement of the Parties",“”? this does not mean that the
application of a correction factor is optional. As Mr. Davalos, Ecuador's head
negotiator for the Block 21 PSC, acknowledged on examination by the Tribunal, "if the
[p]arties do not agree on a correction factor", this disagreement "could be subject to
international arbitration", i.e. resolved by a third-party adjudicator.*”°

All in all, both the language and the purpose of these contractual provisions show that
the tax modification clause of the PSC for Block 21 is mandatory. This conclusion is
confirmed by Article 16 of Decree No. 1417, reproduced in the tax modification of the
PSC for Block 21, the language of which calls for the mandatory adjustment of the
parties’ oil production shares "in order to restore the economics of the contract in place
before the tax modification."”°

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal deems that the application of a correction factor
is mandatory when a tax affects the economy of the PSCs for Blocks 7 or 21. This
correction factor must be of such extent as to wipe out the effects of the tax on the
economy of the PSC. Otherwise stated, the correction factor must restore the
economy of the PSC to its pre-tax modification level.

In conclusion, and for the sole purpose of the resolution of the Treaty claim before it,
the Tribunal considers that the PSCs provided for the following rights: (i) the right to
receive and sell the contractor's share of oil production irrespective of the price of oil

and its internal rate of return, subject to the payment of the taxes and employment
contributions specified in the PSCs; and (ii) the right to the application of a mechanism
that would absorb the effects of any tax increase affecting the economy of the PSCs,
i.e. aright to tax absorption under certain conditions. “*'

3. Did Ecuador Expropriate Burlington's Investment?
3.1. What is the proper approach to examine Burlington's expropriation claim?

The Parties disagree on the approach which the Tribunal should adopt to analyze
Burlington's expropriation claim. While it argues that the measures are expropriatory
whether taken separately or together, Burlington favors a creeping expropriation
approach. By contrast, Ecuador alleges that the Tribunal must first determine whether
Law 42 is expropriatory or not. The Tribunal must therefore determine under which
approach it must review Burlington's expropriation claim.

3.1.1. Positions of the Parties

Burlington alleges that Ecuador expropriated its investment through the following series
of measures: (i) the enactment of Law 42 (initially at the 50% rate and subsequently at
the 99% rate); (ii) the initiation of coactiva proceedings, which lead to the seizure and
auction of Burlington's share of oil production; (iii) the physical takeover of Blocks 7 and
21; and (iv) the termination of the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 through the caducidad
process.“® Burlington maintains that these measures constituted an unlawful

expropriation of its investment "both individually and in the aggregate."

At the hearing and in its post-hearing brief, Burlington stressed that Ecuador's

measures, taken collectively, constituted a creeping expropriation of its investment.“**

Burlington relied on the definition of creeping expropriation adopted in Generation
Ukraine Inc. v. Ukraine:

"Creeping expropriation is a form of indirect expropriation with a
distinctive temporal quality in the sense that it encapsulates the
situation whereby a series of acts attributable to the State over a

clause" (DJ, § 18 n. 1) and "tax modification clause" (supra JJ 21-22) previously employed to

period _of time culminate in the expropriatory taking of such

property"™’” (emphasis in original).
Without a creeping expropriation approach, "Ecuador will receive a discount for having
destroyed much of the value of [Burlington's] investment prior to the physical takeover
[of the Blocks]."“ This would create "perverse incentives" that would reward a State
“for measures that it takes to progressively diminish the value and rights underlying an
asset prior to the final step in the expropriation."**’ As a result, "[u]nder international
law, the Tribunal should consider the acts of Ecuador in the aggregate and judge the

488

final toll on the Claimants’ investments based on all the measures. In brief,

Burlington favors a creeping expropriation approach over a step-by-step approach. *®*

Ecuador argues that Burlington's case "has evolved at [the] hearing."*° Prior to the
hearing, Burlington's case was that Law 42 was a measure tantamount to expropriation
— an indirect expropriation — and that the coactiva seizures and the takeover of the
Blocks constituted a direct expropriation. In a nutshell, Burlington's case was one of
indirect and direct expropriation. Yet, for Ecuador, Burlington "radically changed its
case" at the hearing and adopted a new creeping expropriation theory in lieu of the
expropriation theories it previously advocated.**' For this reason, Ecuador has
"reserve[d] all its rights in this regard."“? In any event, Ecuador contends that
Burlington's creeping expropriation theory is wrong because Law 42 was the initial
cause of the subsequent chain of events:

"We cannot analyze this very case as a creeping expropriation case.
This is intellectually incorrect. And it's intellectually incorrect because
here what we have is different events that are related in a cause-effect
relationship.“* [...] The facts of this case happened in a way that Law
42 should be the cause of the rest of the events, so any theory on
cumulative events going towards something is simply against simple
logic.

Burlington's cumulative indirect [creeping] expropriation case is

nonsense, in our opinion. It is a question of logic. The Tribunal cannot

overlook the cause-effect relationship between Law 42, the coactiva,

the abandonment of the fields, and the declaration of caducidad. You

need to deal with the first event, which is Law 42, and the effects of

Law 42 on the economics of the deal between the Contractor and

Ecuador."*°°
Ecuador further asserts that "Law 42 [was] not an internationally wrongful act."“°° Law
42 did not modify or breach the PSCs. Thus, "Burlington had to comply with [Law
42)."°" It was Burlington's failure to comply with Law 42 that set in motion the
remaining events of the case: "[T]he subsequent events of this case, the coactiva, the
abandonment of the fields by the Consortium, and the declaration of caducidad, are
consequences of [...] [Burlington's] breach of both Ecuadorian law and the [PSCs] for
Blocks 7 and 21." In short, a proper analysis of Burlington's expropriation claim must
begin with Law 42 and a cumulative approach is inapposite under the facts of this case.

3.1.2. Analysis

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal wishes to address Ecuador's allegation that
Burlington "radically changed"“® its case at the hearing by endorsing a creeping
expropriation theory. According to Ecuador, Burlington "brought up an entirely new

case premised on a ‘creeping expropriation’ theory."°°

While Burlington did place
greater emphasis on a creeping expropriation theory from the hearing onwards, the
record does not support Ecuador's allegation that this was a "new" theory. Already in
the Supplemental Memorial on Liability, Burlington alleged that Ecuador's measures
501

"both individually and in the aggregate! (emphasis added) constituted an
expropriation of its investment. Burlington's reference to measures "in the aggregate"
encompasses, albeit with a different label, the creeping expropriation theory favored

from the hearing on.

In its post-hearing brief, Burlington continued to allege that Ecuador's measures
individually, and all of them collectively, were expropriatory — again, as at the hearing,
with an emphasis on a collective approach. Hence, while Burlington shifted the

emphasis of its case, it does not appear that it has changed its case at the hearing.°~
Furthermore, Ecuador has had the opportunity to refute Burlington's creeping
expropriation theory and has in fact availed itself of such opportunity.°°

The Tribunal will now turn its attention to the two competing analytic approaches
according to which it is possible to examine Burlington's expropriation claims. Under
the individualized approach, the evidence of an expropriation is examined measure-by-
measure while under a collective approach all measures are considered together.

In the view of the Tribunal, when the investor puts forward both an individualized and a
collective case of expropriation, one should begin the analysis with the measure-by-
measure approach; the reason being that a collective or creeping approach is typically
employed only when no single measure is in itself expropriatory. This proposition finds
supports both in literature and in previous cases. Michael Reisman and Robert Sloane,
for instance, approvingly refer to an arbitrator's view to the effect that "a creeping
expropriation is comprised of a number of elements, none of which can — separately —

constitute the international wrong"®*

(emphasis added). By contrast, these authors
note that "if one or two events in [a] series [of measures] can readily be identified as
those that destroyed the investment's value, then to speak of a creeping expropriation
may be misleading."°°°

Arbitral awards confirm this view. In Vivendi II, upon which Burlington has heavily
relied, the tribunal stated that "[i]t is well-established under international law that even if
a single act or omission by a government may not constitute a violation of an

international obligation, several acts taken together can"®°*

(emphasis added). The
term "even if" implies that the collective approach is to be applied only after an
individualized analysis has resulted in a finding of no expropriation. The tribunal in

Santa Elena made the point even more explicitly when it held, in a passage quoted in

In other words, Burlington has not submitted that, when both an

approach must be adopted first.

Accordingly, the Tribunal will first analyze each of the challenged measures
individually. In particular, the Tribunal will successively examine (i) Law 42 (both at
50% and 99%), (ii) the coactiva proceedings, (iii) the physical occupation of the Blocks,
and (iv) the caducidad decrees. In the event that none of these measures individually
were found to be expropriatory, it would then consider their cumulative effect.

3.2. Were the application of Law 42 and the failure to absorb its effects
measures tantamount to expropriation?

The Tribunal must determine whether Law 42 and Ecuador's subsequent failure to
absorb its effects was a measure tantamount to expropriation at the rate of 50% and
99%.

3.2.1. Burlington's position

Burlington argues that Law 42, together with Ecuador's failure to absorb its effects, was
"a measure tantamount to expropriation."*'? In other words, Law 42 had the effects of
an expropriation. Law 42 transferred virtually all of Burlington's revenues to

Ecuador.*"* Thus, Law 42 permanently deprived Burlington of practically all of the

Burlington has made the argument that "a State should not be rewarded for measures that it
takes to progressively diminish the value and rights underlying an asset prior to the final step in
the expropriation.” (Tr. 74:15-19). However, this argument does not assist in the determination
of whether an individualized or a creeping approach should initially be adopted; rather, it may
help for quantum purposes in case a creeping approach were finally adopted.

profit to which it was entitled under the PSCs.°"* By way of example, in July 2008, the
price of Napo crude oil was over USD 122 per barrel. Under Law 42 at 99%,
Burlington had to pay to Ecuador over USD 107 per barrel. By 2008 Burlington was
operating at a loss. Hence, Law 42 has substantially deprived Burlington of its revenue
and expropriated its investment.°"*

More specifically, a State's power to tax may devolve into the power to destroy. As lan
Brownlie wrote, "[t]axation which has the precise object and effect of confiscation is
unlawful."°'° Although the Treaty does not define the term expropriation, it recognizes
the possibility that a tax may be expropriatory. Any government measure which results

causes a substantial deprivation and is thus expropriatory is ultimately a fact-specific
question.°"°

in a substantial deprivation of an investor's property is a taking.”

There is no basis for arguing, as Ecuador does, that under the Treaty a tax is
expropriatory only if (i) it is discriminatory, and (ii) intended to confiscate property rights
—a test based on the Restatement of the Law (Third) of Foreign Relations of the United
States.*'° At the same time, Burlington conceded at the hearing that it did "not object
to that [Restatement] standard."*° It added that if this standard were applied, it would
be met in this case.°*"

Furthermore, a tax that is contrary to a tax stabilization provision is expropriatory: "[iJt is
clear that a tax measure will make the leap from a bona fide [g]overnment regulation to

an expropriatory measure when the tax measure violates specific commitments [made

W522

to] a foreign investor. In support of this proposition, Burlington relies on the

decisions in Revere Copper, Benvenuti, and Methanex, which held that tax measures
can effect a taking if they impair contract rights.

In this case, the purpose of Law 42 was to force Burlington to abdicate its rights under
the PSCs. There is ample evidence to this effect. President Correa characterized Law

42 as a "pressuring measure"®* that would prompt oil companies to "sit down to
negotiate."** Furthermore, in a public radio address, President Correa stated that oil
companies had the following "three options"™: (i) continue paying the 99% tax, (ii)
renegotiate the contract into a service contract, or (iii) receive the sunk costs of the
investments and leave the country. That this was the purpose of Law 42 was also
confirmed by Celio Vega at the hearing:

"But when the State calls on companies to renegotiate [the PSCs], the
companies don't heed the call. They don't sit down to negotiate
because they obviously wanted to continue taking in those high
profits. And so the State basically felt obligated to issue Law 42. and
the contractors at that moment just at that point realized they needed
to_ negotiate with the State [...]. Some did not sit down to negotiate,
and well, you know better than me what happened there."**”
(Burlington's emphasis).

In carrying out this purpose, Ecuador stepped out of its role as an ordinary commercial
partner, using its sovereign power to contravene the specific commitments it had made
to Burlington and, in particular, the tax stabilization clauses contained in the PSCs.
These clauses were "crucial [...] as an inducement to long-term investment"** because
they ensured that the value of the contractor's share of oil would not be "eroded by
future Government action [...]."°° They required Ecuador to adjust the contractor's
share of oil production in order to absorb the effects of tax increases having an impact
on the economy of the PSCs.

However, when Law 42 was passed and Burlington requested a readjustment of its
share of oil pursuant to the PSCs, Ecuador ignored these requests. This was no
accident but the fruition of the purpose of Law 42. Compliance with the tax stabilization
clauses would have been incompatible with Ecuador's goal of unilaterally changing the
economic terms of the PSCs.°%° Thus, in passing Law 42 and then ignoring the
requests for readjustment, Ecuador extinguished Burlington's right to the participation
share to which it was entitled under the PSCs.°*' In this way, Ecuador effected a
taking of Burlington's contract rights, a conclusion that finds support in the Revere

Copper and Benvenuti decisions, where the tribunals held that tax measures that
impair contract rights can effect a taking.°*

Contrary to what Ecuador claims, the goal of Law 42 was not to restore the economic

equilibrium of the PSCs.°%

First, Ecuador conducted no analysis of each individual
PSC in order to determine what its equilibrium point was, an exercise that would have
been required taking into account that the different PSCs were "all signed at different
moments in time and had different production levels and different reference
prices [...]."°** In these circumstances, a general across the board measure could not
have served to re-establish an equilibrium point that had not been established in the
first place. Second, Ecuador imposed three different tax rates: 50, 99 and 70. This is
strong evidence that the goal of this tax was not to re-establish the economic
equilibrium of the PSCs. Upon examination by the Tribunal, Mr. Vega conceded that "a
fixed percentage may be able to re-establish [the] equilibrium [point] for some contracts
and not for others."°%°

Although Ecuador denies relying on the rebus sic stantibus principle (or théorie de
limprévision), its own submissions and the expert evidence refer to the requirements
underlying this principle.®° The party invoking the clausula rebus sic stantibus must
show that (i) an extraordinary and unforeseeable or unforeseen event caused an
imbalance in the obligations of the parties; (ii) this imbalance must be such that
performance of the contract would be too burdensome for one of the parties; and (iii)
the event causing the imbalance should not be a consequence of actions or omissions
of the party invoking the principle. Ecuador, however, cannot meet the first two
requirements of the rebus sic stantibus principle.”

Even before the enactment of Law 42, Ecuador was receiving the majority of the

benefits of the oil production. Ecuador claims that it enacted Law 42 because the oil

companies “were even benefitting more than Ecuador from the surge of oil prices"®*

(emphasis in original). This is incorrect as a matter of fact. With respect to Block 7,
Ecuador received a total take on oil revenues of 51.1 percent, whereas the
Consortium's share of oil production was 38.3 percent and its operating costs 10.6

percent. With respect to Block 21, Ecuador's total take on oil revenues was 42.6
percent; whereas the Consortium's share was 48.6 percent and its operating costs 8.8
percent.5°

Furthermore, the increase in oil prices was foreseeable.™'

The parties foresaw the
possibility that oil prices could increase and discussed the possibility of including a
price adjustment clause. Such a clause was included in the Tarapoa Contract, where
the parties agreed that oil revenues resulting from oil prices in excess of USD 17 per
barrel would be shared on a 50/50 basis.“? Ecuador secured this clause in the
Tarapoa negotiations because it offered in return "an extension of the term of the

contract in relation to a highly profitable and productive Block."**

In this case,
however, a Tarapoa-like clause was discussed and rejected, as documented in Annex

V of the PSC for Block 7:

"As an alternative, it was proposed that an average of USD 17 per
barrel be set, with the parties equitably sharing the surplus at 50%
each. This proposal was not accepted by the [contractor] either

[.}

Contrary to Ecuador's allegation, the magnitude of the price increase was also
foreseeable. Ecuador's view is belied by the evolution of oil prices in the twenty-year
period preceding the conclusion of the PSCs. Since the term of the PSCs was twenty
years, it was logical to look at the evolution of oil prices over the twenty-year period
prior to the conclusion of the PSCs. This evolution shows that crude oil prices
experienced the same type of increase in the 70s as they did in the years 2000, i.e.
over USD 100 per barrel in real terms.°“°

Finally, the oil price increase did not render the performance of the PSCs more
burdensome for Ecuador. On the contrary, Ecuador was receiving more benefits from
the PSCs than expected at the time when the contracts were executed. Ecuador's
participation share was more valuable than expected and it was receiving higher
income taxes than anticipated. As a result, Ecuador has not met the requirements to
invoke the doctrine of rebus sic stantibus. Furthermore, it is doubtful that the PSCs are

public service contracts entitled to the protection of this doctrine in the first place. But
even if they were, Ecuador has failed to meet the relevant requirements.

Moreover, Ecuador's allegation that Burlington refused to renegotiate in good faith is

untrue.“

The reason why Burlington was ultimately unable to accept Ecuador's
renegotiation proposals is that they were unreasonable, as they required Burlington to
abandon its rights under the PSCs without even knowing what it would receive in

return.°*”

In March 2008, after the opening of renegotiations two months earlier,
Burlington was evaluating a Draft Partial Agreement that contemplated continuing
operations under the PSCs for up to five years, a proposal that was "particularly
interesting"™* for Block 7. However, President Correa suddenly announced that

Ecuador "could do better"™®,

and Ecuador submitted a new draft agreement which
called for a migration to an undetermined service contract within 120 days. Burlington
could not agree to this proposal or to the similar proposal that ensued, and legitimately
stood on its rights.°°°

Ecuador portrays Burlington as an unreasonable partner because almost all other
companies renegotiated their PSCs. This allegation is disingenuous.** Most investors
commenced arbitration proceedings against Ecuador following the enactment of Law
42, including Petrobras, Repsol, City Oriente, Murphy, and Perenco.** Of the fourteen
PSCs in effect when Law 42 was enacted, only four were successfully converted into
service contracts. Most companies either settled their claims or signed transitory
agreements but no service contracts.* At the end of the day, Ecuador successfully
renegotiated PSCs into service contracts with only two consortia out of ten.**

With respect to the standard for expropriation, Ecuador wrongly argues that Law 42 is
entitled to a presumption that it is a bona fide taxation measure under international
law.°°° If a tax measure were entitled to a presumption of validity, Article X would have
stated so.°° By contrast, Article X makes clear that a tax may be expropriatory. Thus,

tax measures are entitled to no special deference under the Treaty. Similarly, there is
no basis for Ecuador's claim that there is expropriation only if (i) the State intends that
the tax be expropriatory, and (ii) the tax is discriminatory. Because the Treaty provides
no definition of expropriation, the inquiry is a fact specific one.°°”

At any rate, the tax measures would be expropriatory even under Ecuador's own
standard. The evidence shows that the purpose behind Law 42 was expropriatory, for
it was intended to force Burlington and other investors to surrender their rights under
the PSCs. Law 42 was also discriminatory because a lower 70% tax rate would apply
to those who signed a transitory agreement, as opposed to the higher 99% tax rate
applicable to others. Ecuador also relies on EnCana v. Ecuador for the proposition that
a tax is expropriatory only if it is "extraordinary, punitive in amount or arbitrary."°° The
evidence shows that this standard is met. President Correa himself called Law 42 at

the 99% rate "an exaggeration."**

Fair Links, for its part, conceded on cross-
examination that no other country had enacted measures as severe as Law 42 at the

99% rate.°°

Law 42 at the 50% rate had a devastating impact on Burlington's investment.**' First, it
prevented Burlington from recovering past investments, as 2006 was the year in which
it would begin to recoup those investments.* Second, it forced Burlington to scale
back its development plans, thereby diminishing its ability to exploit the Blocks during
the contract term.°® Third, Burlington submitted the Oso Plan despite Law 42 at 50%
because the PSC for Block 7 was to expire in 2010, thus leaving a "short time frame to
develop the reserves available." Fourth, Block 21 was no longer viable with Law 42
at the 50% rate. At that point, Block 7 "carried the Consortium."* Finally, as
illustrated below, Law 42 at 50% had a significant impact on Burlington's total take on
oil revenues.°%

Finally, the Fair Links analysis about the impact of Law 42 is flawed. First, Fair Links
improperly excluded from its analysis the Consortium's capital expenditures - USD 60
million worth of past investments.°”° Second, Fair Links gave an inaccurate version of
the Consortium's IRR because (i) it considered outdated cost projections instead of
actual costs, and (ii) it undervalued the magnitude of the Consortium's investment.
Finally, Fair Links provided an inaccurate picture of the Consortium's profitability as it
did not consider (i) the time value of money, (ii) the deterrent effect of Law 42, and (ii) a
cash flow analysis for the entire life of the PSCs instead of one ending in July 2009.5

For these reasons, Burlington submits that Law 42 was a measure tantamount to
expropriation both at the 50% and at the 99% rates.

3.2.2. Ecuador's position

Ecuador argues that Law 42 did not expropriate Burlington's investment, be it at the
50% rate or at the 99% rate. On the contrary, Law 42 was a legitimate and bona fide
exercise of Ecuador's police powers.°”°

Taxation is part of the State's regulatory powers and in principle does not give rise to a
duty to compensate as a matter of public international law. Ecuador refers to lan
Brownlie's observation that, absent special facts, tax measures are in principle "not

unlawful and do not constitute expropriation."*”*

In conformity with this principle, the
tribunals in Saluka, Sedco, Tecmed and Telenor stated that the State was not liable for
economic injury resulting from the exercise of its regulatory powers. Taxation is one of
the most important aspects of the State's sovereign powers;®”” as such, it is in a

"special category” with respect to expropriation claims.°”*

Because taxes are in a special category, only in exceptional circumstances will a tax be
expropriatory. Case law and doctrinal writings suggest that a tax measure may be
tantamount to expropriation if (i) it produces the effects required for any indirect
expropriation and (ii) in addition, it is discriminatory, arbitrary, involves a denial of due
process or an abuse of rights. Thus, in EnCana, the tribunal held that "[o]nly if a tax is
extraordinary, punitive in amount or arbitrary in its incidence would issues of indirect
expropriation be raised."°”° In short, only in "extreme" cases will a tax be
expropriatory.°°

Under the Restatement of the Law (Third) of Foreign Relations of the United States, a
tax will be "extreme" and thus expropriatory only if it is "discriminatory [and] designed to
cause the alien to abandon the property to the state or sell it at a distress price."**"
Expressly invoking this principle, the tribunal in Emanuel Too v. Greater Modesto held
that the seizure of the claimant's liquor license, home and bank account for failure to

pay tax obligations was not expropriatory.°°*

Similarly, in Paushok v. Mongolia, the
tribunal stated that an investor had no immunity from windfall profit taxes in the

absence of a tax stabilization clause.

measure is not expropriatory unless it entails an "unreasonable interference with an alien's

at 9106. Exh. EL-80).

377. Law 42 was a necessary and appropriate measure under the circumstances. As of

378.

379.

2002, there was an unprecedented and unforeseen rise of oil prices. This unforeseen
increase in the price of oil destroyed the economic equilibrium of the PSCs. This
economic equilibrium must reflect the oil industry's widely accepted assumption that the
State, as the owner of the non-renewable resource, "is to be the main beneficiary of
extra revenue resulting from high oil prices."°** However, the PSCs have limited price
elasticity, i.e. the State's participation share remains the same even though prices
increase. With the massive and unforeseen increase of oil prices, Ecuador was no
longer the main beneficiary of the oil revenues. As a result, the PSCs no longer
reflected a fair division of extractive oil rent between the State and the contractor.°°°

Ecuador's adoption of Law 42 was unexceptional. Since 2002, as many as sixteen
States have adopted measures similar to Law 42 in the wake of soaring oil prices,
including countries such as the United Kingdom and Norway.® In particular,
ConocoPhillips, Burlington's parent company, has likely been subject to measures
similar to Law 42 in various other States, such as Algeria, China or Alaska. Thus,
Ecuador's attempt to restore the economy of the PSCs was in accordance with industry
practice. Initially, Ecuador sought to restore the economy of the PSCs through
negotiations.*” But Burlington obstinately refused to do so, even though it was under
a good faith duty to renegotiate in light of the changed circumstances.*® Faced with
Burlington's intransigence, Ecuador had a constitutional duty to pass Law 42, which
granted the State a participation of "at least 50%" over the oil companies' extraordinary
revenues. °°

Law 42 at the 50% rate was, however, insufficient to restore the economic equilibrium
of the PSCs. That is why, in October 2007, Decree 662 increased the Law 42 rate
from 50% to 99%.°*° Shortly thereafter, in December 2007, Ecuador passed the Ley
de Equidad Tributaria ("LET"), which set the tax rate on extraordinary profits at 70%
and allowed for a new reference price to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.°*"
Ecuador reached an agreement with all major oil companies except Burlington and

Perenco. Despite Ecuador's continuing efforts, Burlington simply refused to negotiate
592

fairer terms for the PSCs.
Contrary to what Burlington alleges, Ecuador does not rely on the rebus sic stantibus
doctrine or théorie de I'imprévision.°* Rather, Ecuador alleges that the massive and
unforeseen increase of oil prices altered the economic premises upon which the parties
entered into the PSCs.° Under these economic premises, which were incorporated
into participation percentages in the PSCs, the price of oil was projected to be around
USD 15 per barrel over the life of the contract and the contractor's IRR at 15%.°°°
Because subsequent events disproved these economic premises, the PSCs had to be
renegotiated.°°

Law 42 did not modify the PSCs. Law 42 deals solely with oil prices while the PSCs
allocate oil volumes and nowhere refer to oil prices.°°” Law 42 cannot modify the PSCs
because it addresses an issue not covered by the PSCs. The Ecuadorian
Constitutional Court (the "Constitutional Court"), the country's highest court, reached
this conclusion.°*® Because the PSCs are governed by Ecuadorian law, the Tribunal
cannot disregard or overrule the Constitutional Court's decision, for this would be
contrary to international law.*°° In particular, the Constitutional Court held that Law 42:

"[C]reates obligations over matters that have not been the subject of
contractual stipulation, that have not been agreed upon or foreseen,
situations that were impossible to foresee, and had they been
foreseeable, by the very nature of the contract, could not have been
part of the [parties] understanding, and therefore they did not affect or
influence the consent of the parties." °°

Likewise, Law 42 did not breach the renegotiation clauses in the PSCs.°' Under
Ecuadorian law, Law 42 is a "levy" and, as such, part of the tax system referred to in
the renegotiation clauses.” Yet, Law 42 did not breach these clauses. To begin with,
Law 42 did not affect the economy of the PSCs. This is because Law 42 only applied

above the price assumption of USD 15 per barrel upon which the PSCs were based.°*
Moreover, even if the economy had been affected, Ecuador did not breach its
obligation to renegotiate the PSCs, as it was in fact always willing to negotiate with
Burlington. The Parties, however, failed to reach an agreement. In light of this failure,
the Tribunal has neither the jurisdiction nor the power to fill in the gap and determine
what the Parties would have agreed to.°*

Moreover, not every contract breach amounts to a treaty breach. Even if Law 42
breached the PSCs, this purported contract breach would not amount to a treaty
breach. As the tribunal in Waste Management v. Mexico held, "the mere non-
performance of a contractual obligation is not to be equated with a taking of
property [...]
effective repudiation of the [contractual] right, unredressed by any remedies available

."©° A contract breach amounts to expropriation only if there is "an

to the Claimant, which has the effect of preventing its exercise entirely or to a
substantial extent."°° Burlington has not met this standard.

With respect to the expropriation claim, Burlington bears a heavy burden. The
standard for expropriation is high when the challenged measure is a tax.°” A State's
regulatory measure is to be presumed valid and Burlington has failed to rebut this
presumption. Contrary to Burlington's arguments, Law 42 was a legitimate and bona
fide exercise of Ecuador's regulatory power.®® The purpose of Law 42 was to "remedy
a disequilibrium caused by a massive and unforeseen increase in oil prices."°* As a
result of the inelasticity of the PSCs, oil companies were drawing more benefits than
Ecuador from this price increase.*"° Law 42 was ultimately intended to ensure a "fair
allocation" of the revenues stemming from the exploitation of Ecuador's natural
resources.°"!

In particular, the tribunal in EnCana v. Ecuador noted that, in the context of
expropriation, "taxation is in a special category."® It is only in an "extreme case" that
a tax of general application may become expropriatory. Specifically, the EnCana

tribunal held that a tax may be expropriatory only if it is “extraordinary, punitive in
amount or arbitrary in its incidence."®'* A tax measure is "extreme" when the State
acts "with a discriminatory intention [and] with a designated purpose to confiscate the
property rights of the investor."®'* However, Burlington has failed to submit evidence
that would meet this standard.°"*

At any rate, Law 42 was not expropriatory, whether at the 50% or at the 99% rate.
First, as shown above, Law 42 did not breach the PSCs. Therefore, Law 42 could not,
by definition, expropriate Burlington's rights under the PSCs. Second, Law 42 did not
constitute a permanent deprivation of Burlington's investment. This is because Law 42
applies if and only if the price of oil is above the reference price. Since Law 42 has
been enacted, the price has not always been above the reference price, such as for
instance in January and February 2009. Third, as specified below, Burlington's rights
under the PSCs did not become worthless.

Law 42 at the 50% rate did not cause Burlington's rights to become worthless.°"° The
Consortium's tax returns show that its gross and after-Law 42-tax profits in 2006 and
2007 were higher than its gross and after-tax profits in 2005.°"” The Fair Links experts

also concluded that Burlington's operations were not "uneconomic. In November

2006, the Consortium submitted the Oso Plan in order to make additional investments
for USD 100 million.° The purpose of the Oso Plan was to show that these additional
investments were "economically viable" both for Ecuador and the contractor.*° Finally,

ConocoPhillips’ annual reports for the period 2006-2008 show no impairment of its

Ecuadorian assets."

Likewise, Law 42 at the 99% rate did not render Burlington's rights worthless. Fair
Links confirmed that Law 42 at 99% "did not alter the global trend of positive cash
flows."° The Consortium's Oso Plan shows that the increase from 50% to 99% did
not substantially alter the economic viability of the project.®? Again, ConocoPhillips’

suspend operations in that year.°*

Burlington has centred its case around the percentages of the Law 42 tax rates, in
order to convey an image that the take of the State was significant. However, what
Burlington does not show is its revenues per barrel in absolute terms.°° In July 2006,
when Law 42 applied for the first time at the 50% rate, Burlington was realizing USD
48.28 per barrel of oil.°° And in November 2007, when Law 42 first applied at the 99%
rate, Burlington was realizing USD 31.37 per barrel of oil.” As shown by the graph
below, these figures are significantly above the equilibrium point the parties agreed
to in the PSCs, and allowed Burlington to make a reasonable profit.

3.2.3. Analysis
a. Standard for expropriatory taxation

Taxation is an essential prerogative of State sovereignty. By virtue of this sovereign
prerogative, States may tax not only their own nationals but also aliens, including
foreign investors, if they effectuate investments in those States.©° A tax is by definition
an appropriation of assets by the State. It is also by definition non-compensable. In
the well-known phrase of Judge Oliver Wendell Holmes, taxes are "the price we pay for

631

civilized society. In other words, general taxation is the result of a State's

permissible exercise of regulatory powers. It is not an expropriation.

There are, however, limits to the State's power to tax. There are limits that arise from
customary international law on taxation and limits that arise from the protections
granted under international law to foreign investments, the only relevant one for
present purposes being the protection against expropriation under the Treaty. In the
absence of guidance in the Treaty as to the relationship between taxation and
expropriation, the Tribunal will consider the limits existing under customary
international law recognizing that "[i]n interpreting a treaty, account has to be taken of
any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties —
a requirement which the International Court of Justice ("ICJ") has held includes

relevant rules of general customary international law."°

Customary international law imposes two limitations on the power to tax. Taxes may

3

not be discriminatory and they may not be confiscatory.®* Confiscatory taxation

essentially "takes too much from the taxpayer."** The determination of how much is
too much constitutes a fact specific inquiry.° Among the factors to be considered one

counts first and foremost the tax rate and the amount of payment required. If the
amount required is so high that taxpayers are forced to abandon the property or sell it
at a distress price, the tax is confiscatory.

The concept of confiscatory taxation appears to correspond to that of expropriatory
taxation. The US Restatement Third of the Law of Foreign Relations provides that
states are responsible for "expropriation [...] when it subjects alien property to taxation
[...] that is confiscatory [...]."°°” Under the Harvard Draft Convention, the execution of
tax laws is not wrongful provided that the tax "is not an abuse of [...] powers [...] for the
purpose of depriving an alien of his property."°° Similarly, in an article on the interface
between investment protection and fiscal powers, Thomas WAalde and Abba Kolo, for
instance, refer to the concepts of "confiscatory taxation" and "expropriatory taxation"
interchangeably.®° Consequently, the notion of confiscatory taxation under customary
international law may inform the Tribunal's understanding of unlawful expropriation by
way of taxes under the Treaty.

The most important factor to distinguish permissible from confiscatory taxation is the
effect of the tax.%° The effects required for a tax to be deemed confiscatory do not
appear to be different from those required to assess the existence of an indirect

expropriation. In other words, confiscatory taxation constitutes an expropriation without

1,641

compensation and is unlawful The Parties have also attached importance to the

effects of the tax. Burlington alleged that Law 42 was a measure tantamount to
expropriation because it "resulted in a substantial deprivation."*? Ecuador has in turn

submitted that a tax measure may be tantamount to expropriation only if it causes "the

effects required for any indirect expropriation."**

When assessing the evidence of an expropriation, international tribunals have
generally applied the sole effects test and focused on substantial deprivation. By way
of example, one may cite Pope & Talbot v. Canada, where the tribunal stated that

644 or

“under international law, expropriation requires a ‘substantial deprivation
Occidental v. Ecuador, where in relation to tax measures, the tribunal referred to the

"65 In Archer

same "criterion of ‘substantial deprivation’ under international law [...]
Daniels v. Mexico, the tribunal noted that "expropriation occurs if the interference is

substantial."°°

When a measure affects the environment or conditions under which the investor carries
on its business, what appears to be decisive, in assessing whether there is a
substantial deprivation, is the loss of the economic value or economic viability of the
investment. In this sense, some tribunals have focused on the use and enjoyment of
property.” The loss of viability does not necessarily imply a loss of management or
control. What matters is the capacity to earn a commercial return. After all, investors
make investments to earn a return. If they lose this possibility as a result of a State
measure, then they have lost the economic use of their investment.

Most tribunals apply the test of expropriation, however it is phrased, to the investment
as a whole.*® Applied to the investment as a whole, the criterion of loss of the
economic use or viability of the investment implies that the investment as a whole has
become unviable. The measure is expropriatory, whether it affects the entire
investment or only part of it, as long as the operation of the investment cannot generate
a commercial return.*°

The inquiry under the test of loss of economic use or viability goes beyond the issue of
whether the challenged measure caused a reduction or loss of profits. In Archer
Daniels, for instance, the tribunal concluded that a "loss of benefits or expectation [...]

one year may indicate that the investment has become unviable and will not return to
profitability, this is not necessarily so and a finding of expropriation would need to
assess the future prospects of earning a commercial return. It must be shown that the

investment's continuing capacity to generate a return has been virtually extinguished.

. Having circumscribed the test applicable to expropriation by way of taxation, additional

questions arise in respect of the role of the State's intent, the discriminatory character
of the tax and the weight of contractual stabilization clauses.

In addition to the impact of the tax, the State's intent is another factor that tribunals

sometimes consider to draw the line between permissible and confiscatory taxation.°*

Therefore, a finding that a State measure is designed to "depriv[e]

property or to cause it to "abandon [...] or sell it at a distress price"’’" would tend to

support a finding of expropriation. However, it is clear that the intent plays a secondary
role relative to the effects test. In Tippetts, the tribunal held that "the intent of the
government is less important than the effects of the measures [...]."°° Thus, evidence
of intent may serve to confirm the outcome of the effects test, but does not replace it.

Under general international law, a tax is illegal not only if it is confiscatory but also if it
is discriminatory.°°° This does not mean, however, that a discriminatory tax amounts
per se to an expropriation. To reach the level of an expropriation, the discriminatory tax
must still meet the test of substantial deprivation discussed above.

Relying on Revere Copper,®*” Burlington has also argued that a tax that is contrary to a
tax stabilization or similar clause amounts to expropriatory. According to Burlington,
such a tax would "make the leap from a bona fide government regulation to an
expropriatory measure." °° It is unquestionable that such a tax would amount to a
breach of contract. However, to determine whether it constitutes an expropriation, the
question remains whether the tax causes a substantial deprivation of the investment as
a whole.

A final comment is in place in this context in connection with the nature of the tax at
issue. The Law 42 tax is a so-called windfall profits tax, i.e. a tax applying to oil
revenues exceeding the ones prevailing at the time the PSCs were executed. By
definition, such a tax would appear not to have an impact upon the investment as a
whole, but only on a portion of the profits. On the assumption that its effects are in line
with its name, a windfall profits tax is thus unlikely to result in the expropriation of an
investment. A definitive conclusion, however, may only be reached after taking into
account the specific circumstances of the case, which the Tribunal will do in the
subsequent sections.

b. Did Law 42 and Ecuador's failure to absorb its effects breach the tax
absorption clauses in the PSCs?

The tax absorption clauses contained in the PSCs were part and parcel of the value of
Burlington's investment. In order to determine the effects of Law 42, the Tribunal must
first determine whether Ecuador's measures were in breach of these clauses and thus
affected the value of Burlington's investment. Although this analysis involves an issue
of breach of contract, it is carried out for the sole purpose of deciding whether there
has been an expropriation.

As an initial matter, the Parties disagree on whether Ecuador relies or not on the

9

doctrine of rebus sic stantibus.©® According to Burlington, Ecuador relies on this

In Revere Copper and Brass, Inc. v. Overseas Private Investment Corporation, (hereinafter
“Revere Copper’), Award of 24 August 1974, the majority of the tribunal held that, although the
effects of the tax — the "Bauxite Levy" — were "not confiscatory", the tax was nonetheless
“expropriatory" because it amounted to a repudiation of the contractual commitment to tax
stability that had deprived the investor of effective control over its investment. (Exh. CL-104 at
pp. 45, 52-55 and 57-60).

Tr. 1266:10-13.
The rebus sic stantibus doctrine has three requirements: (i) an extraordinary and unforeseeable
or unforeseen event must cause an imbalance in the obligations of the parties; (ii) this

imbalance must be severe enough as to render performance of the contract by one of the
parties too burdensome; and (iii) the event in question should not be a consequence of the
actions or omissions of the party invoking the doctrine (CPHB, {| 203, citing to Aguilar Second
ER, 99 27-28).

409.

doctrine, because it refers to the requirements underlying this doctrine. This is
evidenced, for instance, in the reports of Ecuador's experts, Fair Links and Juan Pablo
Aguilar. Ecuador, on the other hand, expressly denies relying on the rebus sic

stantibus doctrine, retorting that Burlington has pushed the wrong "door."*°

The Tribunal notes that certain documents on record contain references to the rebus
sic stantibus doctrine. Notably, the bill that President Palacio submitted to the
Ecuadorian Congress and which subsequently became Law 42 stated that the PSCs
were executed "considering the rebus sic stantibus clause."®*' Further, Ecuador's legal
expert Mr. Aguilar stated, in the section of his report entitled "economic equilibrium of
the contract", that supervening events can affect this economic equilibrium; when they
occur, he explains, "[wJe are faced with the rebus sic stantibus principle."©* Finally,
Fair Links devoted a section of its report to describe how substantial price changes
between 2002 and 2008 affected the economy of the PSCs. These would support
Burlington's contention that Ecuador relies on the rebus sic stantibus doctrine.

In its post-hearing brief, however, Ecuador expressly disclaimed reliance on the rebus
sic stantibus doctrine in this arbitration. It is true that it alleged that "a massive and
unforeseen increase in oil prices" affected the economy of the PSCs. While this
coincides with one of the elements of the rebus sic stantibus doctrine, Ecuador does
not argue that these events subjected it to a burdensome imbalance of obligations, but
rather that they invalidated the economic premises upon which the allocation of oil
production in the PSCs was based. Because these economic premises were,
according to Ecuador, an integral part of the PSCs, they could be relied upon directly
as a matter of contract interpretation. Therefore, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion
that Ecuador does not invoke the rebus sic stantibus doctrine, and that there is thus no
need to examine the requirements of this doctrine.

The Tribunal's next task is to review whether Law 42 modified or breached the PSCs.
Ecuador argues that Law 42 did neither. According to Ecuador, Law 42 did not modify
the PSCs because it dealt solely with oil prices, an issue the PSCs left unaddressed.
The Tribunal is of a different opinion. As was discussed in Section IV(C)(iii) above, the
possibility of including a price adjustment factor similar to the one included in the
Tarapoa Contract was expressly discussed and rejected at the time of the negotiation

A412.

of the PSCs. The non-inclusion of such an adjustment clause in the PSCs was the
product of a deliberate choice by the contracting parties. Thus, the issue was covered
in the PSCs: the parties agreed that oil production would be allocated irrespective of oil
prices. By introducing an oil price factor to allocate oil revenues, Law 42 modified
the parties' choice to exclude such a factor.

Ecuador notes that the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court has already decided that Law
42 did not modify the PSCs, and submits that this Tribunal cannot overrule or disregard
such decision.%° However, while international tribunals should certainly consider
decisions rendered by national courts, they are not bound by them. The purpose of
investment arbitration is neutral adjudication of a dispute by a tribunal independent
from both parties. If the international tribunal adjudicating the dispute were bound by
the decision of an organ that forms part of one of the parties to the dispute, this
purpose would be seriously jeopardized, if not defeated.

Ecuador subsequently argues that Law 42 did not breach the PSCs and the
renegotiation clauses, because Law 42 did not affect the economy of the PSCs and,
even if it did, the application of a correction factor was not mandatory. In Section IV(C)
the Tribunal concluded, however, that the economy of the PSCs meant that the
contractor was entitled to its share of oil production regardless of the price of oil and of
its internal rate of return. The Tribunal considers that in allocating to the State a large
part of oil revenues to which Burlington was entitled under the PSCs, Law 42 had an
impact on the economy of the PSCs.

The impact of Law 42 on the economy of the PSCs was not in and of itself a breach of
the PSCs. As Ecuador has noted, the PSCs expressly contemplated the possibility
that taxes could be increased or decreased. But Law 42 did trigger the contractual
mechanism applicable in the event of a modification to the tax system. As the Tribunal
concluded in Section IV(C), these clauses provided for the mandatory application of a
correction factor in the event of a modification of the tax system. Accordingly, Ecuador

The distinction between oil volumes and oil revenues would, from an economic point of view, be
artificial. The contractor's interest is in the economic value of its share — whether in the form of
oil or cash. This is apparent from the text of Article 4 of Law 1993-44, which provides that "[t]he
contractor's participation share may be received in cash, subject to prior agreement with
PetroEcuador" (Exh. C-15, p. 3 in the original pagination; Tribunal’s translation).

The Ecuadorian Constitutional Court held that Law 42 "[c]reates obligations over matters that
have not been the subject of contractual stipulation, that have not been agreed upon or
foreseen [...] and therefore that did not affect or influence the consent of the parties [in
concluding the PSCs]." (Exh. EL-19, p. 25; RCM, § 280).

415.

was under an obligation to apply a correction factor that would absorb the effects of
Law 42, which had an impact on the economy of the contract.

The record shows that Burlington twice requested Ecuador to comply with this
obligation: once after Law 42 at 50% was passed, and once after the rate was
increased to 99%. In a letter dated 18 December 2006, Burlington first requested
Ecuador to apply a correction factor absorbing the effects of Law 42 at 50%.°* After
Decree 662 increased the rate to 99%, Burlington again requested Ecuador to apply a
correction factor that would absorb the effects of Law 42 at 99%.°°” It is undisputed
that Ecuador did not respond to Burlington's requests that the effects of Law 42 be
absorbed.

Ecuador explains its silence by the fact that Burlington did not provide an "economic
analysis demonstrating that Law 42 had affected the economy of the Participation
Contracts, nor did it put forward what the appropriate adjustment should have been to
re-establish that ‘economy’."®* The explanation is unpersuasive. No economic
analysis was required to show that the economy of the PSCs was affected: Law 42
deprived Burlington of an important portion of oil revenues from its oil participation
share to which it was entitled under the PSCs — oil revenues which were redirected to
the State in the form of taxes. The impact of Law 42 on the economy of the PSCs was
therefore evident.

Additionally, Ecuador's explanation that it failed to respond to the requests for

adjustment because Burlington did not “put forward what the appropriate adjustment

669

should have been’ is no more persuasive. After all, the chief purpose of these

letters was to request the opening of the administrative procedure for the application of

671

a correction factor.°”° The Consortium's pledge to submit "the figures in order to

calculate the correction factor — a pledge made only in the December 2006 letters and

On 18 December 2006, the Consortium's representative wrote to PetroEcuador to request "the
opening of the applicable administrative proceeding for the parties to analyze the economic
impact on the contract of [...] the aforementioned taxes and fees for which the Consortium shall
present the figures" (Exh. C-11 and C-12). On 28 November 2007, Burlington's representative
— as opposed to the Consortium's representative — wrote to the Attorney General of Ecuador
and to PetroEcuador to request that PetroEcuador agree "to engage forthwith in the process of
calculating and implementing a correction factor pursuant to" the tax absorption clauses in the
PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 (Exh. C-43).

418.

not repeated in the November 2007 letters®”* — was not intended to act as a condition
precedent for the opening of such procedure. Rather, those figures were supposed to
be submitted in the context of that administrative procedure.

In the same vein, Dr. Galo Chirlboga, who was the Chief Executive Officer of
PetroEcuador at the time the Consortium sent the requests for readjustment of the oil
participation shares in December 2006, further explained that Ecuador failed to
respond to these requests because of their inappropriate timing, considering the
forthcoming year end holidays and change of administration. In the words of Dr. Galo
Chiriboga:

"We are talking about the last weeks of December; in Ecuador and, |

think, in the rest of the world as well, well, these are very complicated

weeks, not only because of Christmas but also because of New

Year's. And also, added to that, there was a new administration that

was going to take office. [...] To submit a document such as this [the

requests for adjustment] to a Government that ended _ its

administration, | think it's a very inappropriate moment to submit that

kind of document, in my modest opinion."°*
This explanation, however, does not appear to be any more persuasive than the
previous one. Even if the timing of the request had not been appropriate, nothing
prevented Ecuador from responding at a later time. Moreover, Burlington reiterated its
requests for readjustment in November 2007, after Law 42 at 99% was passed, and
still received no response. In sum, Ecuador's failure to respond to Burlington's
requests for readjustment demonstrates its unwillingness to even entertain the
possibility of applying a correction factor. It was this refusal to absorb the effects of
Law 42 that ultimately breached the PSCs.

Ecuador finally argues that, even if the PSCs were breached, these breaches do not
amount to a Treaty breach because they do not amount to "an effective repudiation of
the right [...] which has the effect of preventing its exercise entirely or to a substantial
extent."°* However, by enacting Law 42 and then refusing to absorb its effect
pursuant to the tax absorption clauses, Ecuador has in effect nullified Burlington's right

Indeed, no similar pledge was made in Burlington's letters of 28 November 2007, which make
no reference to the submission of "figures" and solely request the immediate opening of the
process to calculate and implement a correction factor. Thus, Ecuador's argument that it did not
react to the requests for application of a correction factor because it was awaiting the figures
cannot apply with respect to Burlington's letters of 28 November 2007 (Exh. C-43). At any rate,
it is clear from both sets of letters — those of December 2006 and those of November 2007 —
that the gist of the request was the opening of the process that would allow for the calculation of
a correction factor.

to a correction factor by preventing the exercise of this right. Moreover, this nullification
was made possible through the use of Ecuador's sovereign powers. While both parties
to the PSCs may invoke the tax absorption clauses, only Ecuador, as a sovereign
State, may increase taxes and disregard this clause.°”°

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Law 42 affected the economy of the
PSCs and that Ecuador failed to apply a correction factor pursuant to the tax
absorption clauses. Accordingly, Ecuador breached the tax absorption clauses of the
PSCs. This is a relevant, although by no means decisive, consideration for purposes
of the expropriation analysis, which entails a broader inquiry into the investment's
overall capacity to generate commercial returns for the benefit of the investor. The
Tribunal must next determine whether Law 42, first at 50% and then at 99%, amounted
to an expropriation of Burlington's investment.

c. The effects and purpose of Law 42 at 50%

The Parties disagree on the effects of Law 42 at 50%. Burlington claims that Law 42 at
50% had a "devastating" impact on Burlington's investment; specifically, it contends
that Law 42 at 50% "had a significant negative impact on the economics of Block 7 and
destroyed the economics of Block 21."°’° Ecuador counters that Law 42 at 50% is not
a measure tantamount to expropriation because (i) it did not effect a "permanent"
deprivation of Burlington's investment, (ii) nor did it cause Burlington a near total loss of
the value of its PSCs rights.

With respect to the first objection, Ecuador contends that there is no permanent
deprivation because Law 42 only applied when the price of oil was above the reference
price, which was not always the case. In January and February 2009, for instance, the
price of oil was below the reference price. This suffices, according to Ecuador, to
conclude that Law 42 is not expropriatory. The Tribunal is unable to follow this line of
argument. Law 42 permanently applies to "non agreed or unforeseen surpluses,"°””
that is, windfall profits as defined in the law. Just like an income tax is not temporary
because it does not apply in a period in which the taxpayer has no income, the fact that

In the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal observed that the tax absorption clauses may be
invoked by both parties to the contract and thus work "symmetrically" (DJ, {§ 182-183). Thus,
for the sake of accuracy, it should be noted that these clauses are symmetrical only in the sense
that both the State and the contractor may invoke their application. The State, however, is the
only party to the PSC that may increase and decrease taxes and therefore trigger the
application of these clauses. In this other sense, the clauses are asymmetrical.

CPHB, § 172.

Exh. C-7, at Article 2.

144

422.

423.

424.

there may be a period without windfall profits does not turn Law 42 into a temporary
measure.

In other words, while the windfall profits may not be permanent, the application of Law
42 to those profits is permanent. Whenever the price of oil was above the reference
price, half of the revenues in excess of the reference price would be reallocated to the
State. Ecuador's subsequent failure to absorb the effects of Law 42, in accordance
with the tax absorption clauses in the PSCs, confirmed the permanent effects of this
tax. Therefore, Law 42 at 50% effected a permanent deprivation.

In connection with Ecuador's second objection and the substantial loss of the value of
Burlington's investment, Burlington's case is that Law 42 at 50% was "devastating"
because (i) it prevented Burlington from recovering past investments, (ii) it forced it to
scale back its development plans, which would adversely affect its ability to seek an
extension of the PSCs, and (iii) it rendered Block 21 economically non-viable.
Burlington has provided no expert evidence to buttress these allegations. Ecuador
replies that Law 42 at 50% did not cause a near total loss of the value of Burlington's
rights under the PSCs. It bases its reply on the Consortium's tax returns for the years
2005 to 2007, the Fair Links report, the Consortium's Oso Development plan, and
ConocoPhillips’ annual reports for 2006 to 2008.

Law 42 at the 50% rate applied between April 2006 and October 2007. From April to
December 2006, Burlington made Law 42 payments in the amount of USD 15.85
million for Block 7 (42.5% of total Law 42 payments of USD 37.303 for Block 7),°’° and
USD 23.04 million for Block 21 (46.25% of total Law 42 payments of USD 49.814
million for Block 21).°° In the aggregate, Burlington made Law 42 payments for a total
of USD 38.89 million in 2006. The real impact of Law 42 is, however, lower than what
the total Law 42 payments reflect: had Law 42 payments not been made, the
corresponding amounts would have become additional income for Burlington, to which
the ordinary income tax and employment contributions would have applied. As the
income tax (25%) and the employment contribution (15%) alone add up to about

As previously noted, Burlington's ownership interest in Block 7 is 42.5% and the total Law 42
payments are reflected in its financial statements for 2006 (Exh. C-419, p. 6).

Burlington's ownership interest in Block 21 is 46.25% and the total Law 42 payments are
reflected in its financial statements for 2006 (Exh. C-419, p. 9).

142

425.

426.

40%, the real impact of Law 42 is approximately 60% of the total Law 42 payments,
i.e. about USD 23 million."

Still in 2006, Burlington made net profits of USD 30.85 million in Block 7 (42.5% of total
net profits of USD 72.579 for Block 7)® and USD 13.33 million in Block 21 (46.25% of
total net profits of USD 28.821 for Block 21).° In the aggregate, Burlington made net
profits of USD 44.18 million in 2006. However, since Law 42 only applied for three-
fourths of the year, the impact of Law 42 in 2006 must be measured on three-quarters
of the total profits (or 75% of USD 44.18 million), which equal USD 33.14 million. Had
Law 42 not applied, Burlington's three quarter profits of USD 33.14 million would have
been USD 56.14 million (USD 33.14 million + USD 23 million). Thus, Law 42 at 50%
reduced Burlington's net profits by around 40% (USD 23 million out of a total of USD
56.14 million).

In 2007, Law 42 at 50% applied for the ten-month period spanning from January to
October 2007. As of November 2007, Burlington was subject to the higher 99% rate.
The overall impact of Law 42 on Burlington's investment was greater in 2007 than in
2006. Burlington's Law 42 payments in 2007 totalled USD 87.74 million (42.5% of USD
98.128 million for Block 7 plus 46.25% of USD 99.552 million for Block 21).%* The real
impact of these payments (taking into account the taxes that Burlington would have
paid had it not been subject to Law 42) was of approximately USD 52.64 million.
Burlington's profits, in turn, totalled USD 30.95 million (42.5% of USD 57.28 million for
Block 7 plus 46.25% of USD 14.3 million for Block 21).%° Thus, Law 42 diminished
Burlington's net profits by around 62.9 % in 2007 (USD 52.64 million out of USD 83.6
million).°° However, because Burlington's financial statements do not appear to
distinguish between Law 42 payments at the 50% rate from those at the 99% rate, it is
not possible to precisely determine the impact of Law 42 at 50% in 2007. This impact
is certainly lower than 62.9%, since Law 42 applied at the 99% rate during November
and December 2007. The figures for 2006 appear therefore more reliable to evaluate
the impact of Law 42 at 50%.

As explained supra at note 17, the combined impact of the income tax and the employment
contribution is 36.5%, not 40%. However, since municipal taxes and reinvestment obligation

must also be taken into account, it appears reasonable to round it up at 40% for computation
purposes.

The exact figure is USD 23.33 million.

Another way to appreciate the effects of Law 42 on Burlington's investment is to focus
on the distribution of the proceeds from the sale of a barrel of oil.°°” From the proceeds
of a barrel of Oriente crude oil from Block 7, the market value of which was USD 66.56
in July 2006, Burlington would have received USD 48.28 and would have made Law 42
payments at 50% for USD 18.36. The Law 42 tax would amount to 27.6% of the total
value of the Oriente crude oil barrel, or slightly more than one-fourth.

The impact would have been greater for a barrel of Napo crude from Block 21.
Although the price of Napo oil from Block 21 was lower (in July 2006 it was USD 57.43
per barrel; Oil Prices tab at the end of Martinez's direct examination bundle), the Law
42 reference price was also lower (USD 15 in April 2006). Assuming that the reference
price of Law 42, adjusted for inflation, had been USD 20 per barrel in Block 21, the
impact of Law 42 would have been close to one-third (the Law 42 payment would have
been USD 18.715 per barrel of Napo oil, or 32.6% of the value of a Napo oil barrel).

In relative terms, Law 42 at 50% reduced Burlington's take on the total oil revenues
(after taxes and including operating costs) produced by the Blocks from 48.9% to
34.6% in Block 7 (a 29.2% reduction), and from 57.4% to 38.6% in Block 21 (a 32.8%
reduction). If Burlington's operating costs are subtracted from its revenues, Law 42 at
50% reduced Burlington's take on total oil revenues from 38.3% to 24% in Block 7 (a
37.3% reduction), and from 48.6% to 29.9% (a 38.5% reduction) in Block 21.

On the basis of these figures, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the effects of Law 42 at
50 % do not amount to a substantial deprivation of the value of Burlington's investment.
Arbitrator Orrego Vicufa disagrees with this finding for the reasons explained in the
attached dissenting opinion.

This conclusion is reinforced by the following facts. First, despite the enactment of Law
42 at 50%, the Consortium submitted a plan for additional investments of USD 100
million in the Oso field, which according to Burlington's own description was the
"largest field in Block 7 and the center of the Block's development plans."** As
Ecuador noted, in submitting the Oso plan, the Consortium implicitly conceded that
Block 7 was economically viable even with Law 42 at the 50% rate. Second,
Burlington's allegation that Block 21 was "not viable" with Law 42 at 50% is not
supported by the record. As Fair Links pointed out, Burlington's financial statements

Law 42 applied whether there was an actual sale or not. Hence, actual proceeds were not a
prerequisite for the application of Law 42.

Mem., § 174.

434.

for Block 21 do not show a loss but a "positive figure."*°

Third, Burlington
acknowledged that there were bidders willing to acquire its interest in the Blocks

despite the effects of Law 42 at 50%.°°

The Parties disagree on the purpose of Law 42 at 50%. According to Burlington, the
purpose of Law 42 at 50% was to force it to abdicate its rights under the PSCs and was
thus expropriatory. Ecuador maintains that the purpose of Law 42 was to restore the
economics of the PSCs, to prompt oil companies to negotiate with the State, and
ultimately to strike a fair allocation of the oil revenues. The record does not support
Burlington's allegation that the purpose behind Law 42 at 50% was expropriatory. The
purpose seems rather to have been to replicate in the PSCs the effects that the price
adjustment clause in the Tarapoa Contract would produce in a scenario of high oil
prices, i.e. to share the windfall profits resulting from the higher prices on a 50/50 basis
between the State and the oil company. As one Ecuadorian congressman observed in
the context of the discussions of President Palacio's bill that would later become Law
42:

"Look, it’s as if it were copied, that is the proposal that the
Government is making, what is already envisaged in one contract [the
Tarapoa contract], and we want that this, which is already envisaged
in one contract, be incorporated in the rest of the contracts."°""

These facts corroborate the Tribunal's earlier conclusion that Law 42 at 50% did not
substantially deprive Burlington of the value of its investment, and was therefore not a
measure tantamount to expropriation.

d. The effects and purpose of Law 42 at 99%

The Parties also disagree on the effects of Law 42 at 99%. Burlington asserts that Law
42 at 99% "destroyed" the value of its investment. As a result of Law 42 at 99%,

At the hearing, Mr. Mélard de Feuardent, testifying on behalf of Fair Links, explained the
following in connection with the Consortium's 2006 financial statement for Block 21: "On these
figures you will see the profit and loss account for Block 21. What do we see? Total income is
171.9 million [...]. Total cost, 117.8 million, which leads you to a result before tax of [USD] 54
million and after tax of [USD] 28.8 million. That is not a taxable income loss. That is a positive
figure. Costs are less than revenues" (Tr. 1170:5-12; Exh. C-419, p. 9). A similar analysis and
conclusion would result from the 2007 financial statement for Block 21 (Exh. C-420, p. 9). Law
42 at 50% was in force from April 2006 to October 2007; thus, the 2006 and 2007 financial
statements cover the entire period in which the 50% tax was applicable. This evidence appears
to belie Mr. Martinez's testimony to the effect that Law 42 at 50% "effectively made Block 21 go
negative in income" (Tr. 339:6-8).

Burlington's specifically alleged that when Law 42 at 99% was enacted, "prospective
purchasers" of its Ecuadorian assets "rescinded their offers" (Mem., § 261; CSM, § 31.). This
presupposes that these offers were valid before the Law 42 rate was increased to 99%, that is,
when Law 42 at 50% was in effect.

Exh. C-177, at 73.

145

435.

437.

Burlington claims that it sustained a loss of USD 60 million in 2008, and it made no
additional investments in either Block 7 or Block 21. In contrast, Ecuador essentially
argues that Burlington sustained no loss in 2008 because Law 42 at 99% "did not alter
the global trend of positive cash flows", that the Oso plan shows that Law 42 at 99%
did not substantially alter the viability of Burlington's investment, and_ that
ConocoPhillips' annual reports for 2006 to 2008 show no impairment of its Ecuadorian
assets.°

Law 42 at the 99% rate applied from November 2007 to around March 2009. In 2008,
the only year in which Law 42 at 99% applied for the entire year, Burlington made Law
42 payments in the amount of USD 102.33 million (42.5% of total Law 42 payments of
USD 240.78 million) for Block 7,° and USD 100.76 million (46.25% of total Law 42
payments of USD 217.86 million) for Block 21.° In combination, in 2008, Burlington
made Law 42 payments for a total of USD 203.09 million. The real impact of Law 42,
considering that Burlington would in any event have had to pay income tax (25%) and
employment contributions (15%) over this amount, amounts to USD 121.85 million.

. The Parties specifically disagree on whether Burlington sustained losses or made

profits in 2008. Their disagreement appears to stem from the different analytical tools
on which they rely to value Burlington's operations. Burlington relies on its financial
statements, which include amortizations for USD 106.29 million in 2008. Ecuador, by
contrast, argues that financial statements and amortizations present a distorted picture
of the economic reality of Burlington's operations, and that the correct analysis should
focus on cash flows.

According to Burlington, amortization helps to assess the impact of Law 42 at 99% on
its investment. In order to properly ascertain this impact, the Consortium's past
investments must be taken into account, i.e. amortized. Burlington maintains that Fair
Links wrongly excluded from its analysis the impact of the Consortium's capital
expenditures. On direct examination, Mr. Martinez explained that amortization meant
that a dollar spent in a given year for capital investments did not need to be accounted
for in that particular year, but could be spread out over the next three to five years
depending on the type of asset and the amortization rate. Mr. Martinez testified that
the financial statements properly include the amortization of past investments because:
Ecuador also argues that Law 42 at 99% was not expropriatory because it did not cause

Burlington a "permanent" deprivation. That objection has already been disposed of in the
context of Law 42 at 50% for reasons that apply with the same force here as well.

"You have to account for your capital. You have to account for the
investment that you made in order to [...] generate the income. And
it's, you know. If you're going to go out and buy a car, you don't buy a
car with nothing. You have to account for that price, and you have to
account for that investment.

The amortization is just a countermeasure to account for that
investment. If you summed up all the amortizations and you looked at

the total investment, they'll sum up, so you have to account for that

capital investment that you made, and accounting-wise that's how you
lo it.”

438. Upon examination by the Tribunal, Mr. Martinez testified that Fair Links failed to

account for USD 60 million worth of capital expenditures made by the Consortium:

"(T]he Fair Links Report [is] inaccurate. It doesn't have about $60
million worth of investment accounted for in that table [...]. When you
look at what the full investments are, they don't account for it all. |
can't tell you where they missed it, but they missed it. [...] [W]e spent
quite a bit of money in Block 21 in 2006. We drilled, | believe, almost
11 wells, and that's not — it doesn't get reflected enough [in the Fair
Links Report]"®* (emphasis added).

439. According to Ecuador, the tool to evaluate Burlington's economic operations is a cash

flow analysis, because it is not affected by accounting conventions, such as
amortization, which "may distort the economic understanding" of a project.” On direct
examination, Mr. Mélard de Feuardent of Fair Links defined cash flows, annual cash

flows and cumulative cash flows:

"What are cash flows? A very simple process. This is what you take
out of your pocket when you [make] an investment, what you take out
of your pocket to finance the [investment's] operation, and then what
you get into your pocket as revenue for operation. The sum of these
three out-of-pocket issues are what constitutes the annual cash flows.
[In the graphs below], the annual cash flows are represented by the
gray bars. [...].

Annual cash flow will not help you to look at the overall profitability of

the project [...]. The profitability of the long-term project is to be
considered as the sum of the annual cash flows over the whole life of
the project [...]. This sum is represented in our graph by the red line,

which represent[s the] cumulative cash flow_of the project starting

[from] 2000 onwards"*”” (emphasis added).

On the basis of this cash flow analysis, Fair Links concluded that:

"Law 42 and Decree 622 did not alter the global trend of positive cash

flows. In fact, for both Blocks the most significant annual cash
contributions over the life of the Projects are either in 2007 (Block 21)
or 2008 (Block 7), i.e. when Law 42 then Decree 622 were fully
applicable"? (emphasis added).
Ecuador additionally argues that Burlington's financial statements evince an excessive

amortization rate. By 2008, the financial statements report an accumulated

amortization for both Blocks of approximately 80%.”°' Fair Links further observed that
by 2006, only two years after Block 21 started to produce, the amortization was at 42%.
Since the PSC's life did not end until 2021, this "clearly shows that [...] there is an
overburden of [] amortization.""* As a result, Fair Links concludes that this is "a good
illustration why financial statements such as [the Consortium's] are not the [right]
approach to understand the profitability of a long-term contract."”

The Tribunal agrees that past investments must be accounted for and that it thus
appears fair to consider amortization. At the same time, the Tribunal notes that the
cumulative rate of amortization is considerable, reaching about 80% in Block 21 by
2008 — even though the Consortium was entitled to operate this Block until 2021. Even
if the amortization rates used were required by Ecuadorian law, as Burlington has
alleged”™
the Tribunal must necessarily rely on those rates to determine whether there was

, and/or are in conformity with accounting standards, this does not mean that

expropriation under the Treaty.

It appears that the loss Burlington suffered in 2008 was attributable to such high rate of

amortization.” Indeed, before amortization, the Consortium made profits of USD 62.3

g, 708

million in 2008,”°° paying nearly USD 10 million in income taxes for that year.” Thus,

the Tribunal considers that even if Burlington sustained an accounting loss in 2008, this

Investments were amortized in accordance with a distinction between pre-production and
production investments. Pre-production investments were amortized on a linear basis over a
five-year period. Production investments, on the other hand, were amortized on a unit-of-
production basis, i.e. seemingly as a function of the level of production, although there is no
clear indication on record of how this method is to be applied (CPHB, 4179 n. 221; Exhs. C-258
and C-259; Notes 3(f) and (g); Exhs. C-260 to C-263, Notes 3(f) and (h)).

Indeed, Burlington made virtually no investments in the Blocks in 2008: it invested USD 1.39
million in Block 7 and made no investment in Block 21 (CPHB, § 50; Exhs. C-258 to C-260 and
C-418 to C-419). Yet, its financial statements reflect amortizations for a total of USD 106.29
million. This does not allow to properly assess the effects of Law 42 at 99% in 2008, because of
the weight of previous capital expenditures. In fact, in 2008, the Consortium's amortizations
account for nearly 50% of the Consortium's total expenses — USD 106.29 million out of USD
224.66 million (Fair Links ER, Appendix 11; CPHB, Annex 2).

In 2008, the Consortium's gross profits totaled USD 180.7 million; its total costs before
amortization amounted to USD 118.369. Thus, before amortization, the Consortium made
profits of USD 62.3 million (Fair Links ER, Appendix 11; CPHB, Annex 2).

The Consortium paid income taxes for USD 9.78 million and employment contributions for USD
6.9 million. Fair Links ER, Appendix 11; CPHB, Annex 2.

is not in itself sufficient evidence that Law 42 at 99% caused a substantial deprivation
of the value of its investment.”

Furthermore, the Fair Links cash flow approach, which did not disregard the
Consortium's past capital expenditures but rather took them into account in the year in
which they were incurred,”° leads to the conclusion that, despite Law 42 at 99%, the
Consortium was still experiencing a "global trend of positive cash flows",’"° both annual
and cumulative, in each of the Blocks.”'' At the hearing, Mr. Mélard de Feuardent
testified, on behalf of Fair Links, that "the cash flow was positive in 2008 [...] which
mean[s] that the company was not getting money out of its pocket during operation
[but] was getting money in its pocket."’"? This evidence tends to disprove Burlington's
allegation of substantial deprivation.

Burlington has relied on the Consortium's 2008 five-year plan as evidence of its future
earning projections following the enactment of Law 42.’"° The five-year plan shows
that Burlington would seemingly not make new investments, that total annual oil
production would decline year after year, and that as a result the production cost per
barrel of oil extracted would increase.”"* The five-year projection, however, does not

show that the investment would lose its capacity to generate a commercial return for

Burlington in the future.”°

On the other hand, the effects of Law 42 at 99% on Burlington's investment may also
be evaluated by focusing on how the proceeds of a barrel of oil allocated to Burlington
Oriente pursuant to the PSCs would have been distributed. For Block 7, the proceeds
of a barrel of Oriente crude oil priced at USD 83.20 in November 2007, at which time
the reference price adjusted for inflation was of USD 30.85,”"° would have been

observation: "[A] loss of that size for one year is not a matter leading to the destruction of an

Alex Martinez testified that, on account of the declining production and the increased production
costs per barrel shown in the five-year plan, "you get to the point where you can see where it's
going to cross", i.e. presumably where costs would exceed revenues (Tr. 547:22-548:4). On the
basis of this document alone, however, it is not possible to reach the conclusion that production
costs per oil barrel would have exceeded revenues in that five-year time frame.

allocated as follows: USD 31.37 per barrel to Burlington (USD 30.85 plus one percent
of USD 52.35), and USD 51.83 per barrel to Ecuador.” Hence, Law 42 at 99%
deprived Burlington of 62.3% of the value of each barrel of Oriente crude oil allocated
to its subsidiary under the PSCs.

For Block 21, the original reference price as of March 1995 was USD 15.36.” There
does not appear to be evidence on record of the statutory reference price of a barrel of
Napo crude oil, adjusted for inflation, in November 2007. Assuming that the reference
price was USD 19 at the time,’"® the proceeds of a barrel of Napo oil priced at USD
79.09 in November 2007”° would have been apportioned as follows: USD 20.6 per
barrel for Burlington (USD 20 plus one percent of USD 59.09) and USD 58.5 per barrel
for Ecuador. Consequently, Law 42 at 99% deprived Burlington of approximately
73.9% of the value of each barrel of Napo crude oil allocated to its subsidiary under the
PSCs.

Yet another approach to ascertain the effects of Law 42 at 99%, one that Burlington
has favored in presenting its case, is to consider the percentage reduction of
Burlington's total oil revenues as a result of the tax. Law 42 at 99% reduced
Burlington's take on the total oil revenues produced by the Blocks — after taxes but
including operating costs — from 48.9% to 20.5% in Block 7” (a 58% reduction), and
from 57.4% to 17.1% in Block 21” (a 70.2% reduction). This approach confirms that
Law 42 at 99% considerably diminished Burlington's profits, but does not prove that
Burlington's investment became unprofitable or worthless.

Additionally, Ecuador has relied on the Consortium's Oso Plan and on ConocoPhillips’
annual reports to show that Law 42 at 99% was not expropriatory. However, Burlington
submitted the Oso Plan when the Law 42 rate was at 50% and as such this
consideration is of little assistance for the 99% tax rate inquiry. Further, the fact that
ConocoPhillips’ annual reports show no impairment for the 2006-2008 periods tends to
suggest that the group did not consider that Law 42 at 99% had substantially deprived

The evidence shows that the reference price for Block 21 was USD 19.06 in April 2008 (COSS,

been approximately USD 19 in November 2007.

it of its investment in Ecuador at the time.”*° On the other hand, the lack of impairment
report in the annual accounts may have other explanations: the group could have
considered, for instance, that it could still be compensated for the tax pursuant to the
terms of the PSCs, or that it could reach a settlement with Ecuador. Thus, these
considerations do not appear to be dispositive of the issue under examination.

With respect to the purpose of Law 42 at 99%, the Parties have presented diverging
views. Burlington argues that the purpose of Law 42 was to force it to abdicate its
rights under the PSCs. Ecuador, by contrast, contends that the purpose of Law 42 was
threefold: (i) to restore the economic equilibrium of the PSCs; (ii) to achieve a fair
allocation of the petroleum rent between the oil companies and the State; and (iii) to
prompt oil companies to negotiate with the State.

Ecuador's allegation that Law 42 was intended to restore the economic equilibrium of
the PSCs is unsupported by the record. As examined in Section IV(C)(iv), Ecuador did
not invoke the PSCs when it sought to renegotiate terms with Burlington. Similarly,
Ecuador applied the same tax rate to all PSCs, which suggest that such tax rate was
not calibrated to restore the specific economic equilibrium of each PSC. Furthermore,
when the Ecuadorian Congress discussed the bill that eventually became Law 42, an
Ecuadorian congressman noted that the issue was whether the PSCs could be
modified:

"By virtue of this Law [44] various [oil] contracts were renegotiated.

One of the contracts that was renegotiated in the first place was [that

of] the Tarapoa block, and that renegotiation was so well done that it

included the [clause] that the [first congressman] read out, by which,

when the barrel of oil exceeds USD 17, [the revenues] are shared

between the State and the contractor on a 50/50 basis. Then there

were other renegotiations [...], and in those renegotiations, strangely,

the clause that exists in the [Tarapoa] contract was not included. Now,

faced with the bill sent by the President of the Republic, we have
discussed whether or not_we can by law_unilaterally modify oil

contracts with retroactive effect. That_and_no other is the legal

issue"’”™* (emphasis added).
Ecuador further claims that it passed Law 42 to achieve a fair allocation of the
petroleum rent. The record indeed supports the proposition that Ecuador perceived the
significant increase in oil prices as having created an inequitable situation where oil
companies obtained undeserved windfall profits to the detriment of the State. The
Tribunal acknowledges that a fair sharing of the rent may well have been Ecuador's

By contrast, ConocoPhillips’ annual reports for 2009, the year in which Ecuador intervened in
the Blocks, do show an impairment.

general and indeed legitimate goal. However, under the specific facts of this case,
Ecuador had an obligation to respect the tax absorption clauses included in the PSCs.

Finally, Ecuador argues that Law 42 was intended to prompt oil companies to negotiate
with the State. While this goal may have been related to Ecuador's view that the
allocation of oil revenues under the PSCs was unfair, it provides no ground to disregard
Burlington's rights under the PSCs. Ecuador appears to have passed Law 42 without
intending to apply the correction factor required by the tax absorption clauses of the
PSCs. This course of action lends credence to Burlington's allegation that Law 42 was
intended to force Burlington to abdicate its rights under the PSCs. At any rate, as the
tribunal in Tippetts stated, "the intent of the government is less important than the
effects of the measures [...]."""° In particular, the State's intent alone cannot make up
for the lack of effects amounting to a substantial deprivation of the investment.

Having considered all the evidence, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Law 42 at 99%
substantially deprived Burlington of the value of its investment. While Law 42 at 99%
diminished Burlington's profits considerably, Burlington's allegations that its investment
was rendered worthless and unviable have not been substantiated. Rather, the
evidence shows that, notwithstanding the enactment of Law 42 at 99%, the investment
preserved its capacity to generate a commercial return. Finally, although the evidence
shows that Ecuador passed Law 42 without intending to comply with the tax absorption
clauses, there can be no expropriation in the absence of substantial deprivation.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the effects of Law 42 at 99%
were not tantamount to expropriation and, accordingly, that Law 42 at 99% did not
expropriate Burlington's investment. Arbitrator Orrego Vicufia disagrees with this
finding for the reasons explained in the attached dissenting opinion.

3.3. Did Ecuador expropriate Burlington's investment by enforcing Law 42
through the coactiva process, seizures and auctions?
3.3.1. Burlington's position
Burlington argues that the coactiva seizures and auctions constituted a direct and
complete taking because they had the effect of destroying the value of its
investment.’””° Specifically, Burlington alleges that (i) the coactiva process was in
breach of the PSCs and the Tribunal's provisional measures order; (ii) the coactiva

process was a retaliation for Burlington's refusal to abdicate its rights under the PSCs;
and (iii) the coactiva process was an expropriatory measure.’””

First, the coactiva process breached the PSCs, which established that a percentage of
the oil production would be allocated to Burlington. The process was also contrary to
the Tribunal's provisional measures order.”® On 14 February 2009, President Correa
stated at a press conference that his country would "not pay attention to extra-regional
authorities that attempt to tell us what to do or what not to do.

policy, Ecuador paid no heed whatsoever to the Tribunal's order that the coactiva

"728 In line with this

process be discontinue

Second, Burlington submits that the coactiva process was a retaliation for its refusal to
abandon its rights under the PSCs.’*"_In June 2008, the Consortium began paying the
Law 42 dues into a segregated account. For eight months, Ecuador voiced no
objection against that practice. It did not register any complaint, place Burlington on
notice of forfeiture, or make any effort to enforce Law 42.” It was only after Burlington
stood its ground during the renegotiations, which broke down in December 2008, that
Ecuador initiated the coactiva process.’ The timing and discretionary nature of this
process demonstrate that it was used as a retaliatory measure against Burlington
following the breakdown of the renegotiations.”

Third, Burlington contends that the coactiva process was an expropriatory measure.’*°
It notes that the auction process was a failure because no entity other than
PetroEcuador was willing to participate in the auctions. Potential bidders were
apparently dissuaded from participating because ownership over the oil cargoes was
disputed.’ This allowed PetroEcuador to acquire the auctioned oil at steep discounts
ranging from 33% to 50%. The failed auction process prejudiced Burlington in that it
resulted in reduced offsets of the alleged Law 42 debts. PetroEcuador, by contrast,

benefited from this failed process as it could acquire the oil at below-market prices,
only to resell it at market prices.”*”

The coactiva process was a "complete taking" because it had the effect of destroying
the value of Burlington's investment.”® The coactiva process deprived Burlington of
any income.” As a result, Burlington had to fund an investment from which it derived
no revenue. Like the investors in Benvenuti v. Congo and Starrett Housing v. Iran,
Burlington was deprived of the "right to earn revenue from the receipt of its production

share."”“

Thus, the coactiva process was a direct taking of Burlington's tangible
assets and of the economic benefits of its investment.”' In addition, as it was found in
Saipem, the coactiva process also expropriated Burlington's right to have this dispute
adjudicated by an ICSID tribunal, as it was in breach of the Tribunal's provisional

measures order.”

3.3.2. Ecuador's position

Ecuador states that the coactiva process merely enforced Law 42.”° This process was
the normal legal consequence of Burlington's failure to make its Law 42 payments.”
Contrary to Burlington's allegations, (i) Ecuador duly considered the Tribunal's
provisional measures before commencing the coactiva process; (ii) the coactiva
process was initiated in application of Ecuadorian law and not in retaliation for
Burlington's decision not to sign the transitory agreements; and (iii) the coactiva
process was not an expropriatory measure.

First, it is not true, as Burlington would have the Tribunal believe, that Ecuador ignored
the provisional measures. At the hearing, Ministers Pastor, Palacios and Pinto testified
that they had given serious consideration to the Tribunal's recommendations.’
Minister Pinto testified that Ecuador examined with great “caution the statements made
by the Tribunal." Under Ecuadorian law, public officials were under a duty to enforce
Law 42, the breach of which would have resulted in civil and criminal liability. The

enforcement of Law 42 was therefore not a matter of discretion under Ecuadorian
747

law.
Second, Ecuador argues that the coactiva process was intended to enforce Law 42,
not to retaliate against Burlington. Under Ecuadorian law, PetroEcuador was
empowered to collect outstanding Law 42 payments.”® In connection with the alleged
eight-month delay in initiating the coactiva process, Ecuador claims that it did not want
to hamper the ongoing negotiations with Burlington and that Law 42 dues were
calculated and liquidated annually. Thus, Ecuador had to await the end of 2008 before
enforcing Law 42.’°

Third, Ecuador counters Burlington's argument that the coactiva process was
expropriatory because PetroEcuador purchased the seized production at a "steep
discount." °° At the first auction, no bids were submitted; thus, a second auction round
was arranged. At this second auction, PetroEcuador submitted a bid for 50% of the
appraised value of the oil, as allowed under Ecuadorian law. In all subsequent
auctions, PetroEcuador submitted bids at the first round for slightly more than two-
thirds of the appraised value of the oil, again in conformity with Ecuadorian law.”®'

PetroEcuador submitted bids only because there were no other bidders due to the
Consortium's fault. In fact, the Consortium threatened legal action against any
company that would acquire the seized oil. Dissuaded by these threats, no other
company submitted bids.” This interference with the auctions harmed both the State
and the Consortium, as it delayed the settlement of the outstanding Law 42 payments.
Therefore, Burlington and Perenco have only themselves to blame if the auction
process resulted in "reduced offsets" of the overdue Law 42 payments.”®

At any rate, Burlington has failed to show that the coactiva process had the effect of
destroying the value of its entire investment. The coactiva process was economically
neutral, since Burlington's Law 42 debts were extinguished as its oil was seized.”**
Additionally, Burlington has wrongly argued, relying on Saipem, that Ecuador's decision

not to comply with the Tribunal's recommendation amounted to expropriation.
Saipem's broad interpretation of the term investment, expressly dismissed in GEA v.
Ukraine, is inapplicable to provisional measures the goal of which is merely to prevent
an aggravation of the dispute.”° In short, Burlington has not shown that the coactiva
process was expropriatory.”°

3.3.3. Analysis
a. Standard for expropriation

Burlington argues that the coactiva measures constituted a direct and complete
expropriation of its investment. Relying on LG&E v. Argentina, Ecuador has alleged
that direct expropriation is the "forcible appropriation by the State of the tangible or
intangible property of individuals by means of administrative or legislative action."’*”

Burlington has not taken issue with this definition, and rightly so.

In this investment dispute, the "property" protected by the Treaty's expropriation clause
is Burlington's entire investment in Ecuador ("[iJnvestments shall not be expropriated
[...]").. The forcible appropriation or taking, however, only concerned the oil that was
seized and not the entire investment as it was defined above. Thus, under the Treaty,
there can be no direct expropriation of the investment as a result of the seizures per se.

This being so, Burlington's submission goes further in the sense that it argues that the
effect of the coactiva measures was not only to deprive it of the oil seized and the
related revenue but more generally to destroy the economic value of its investment. In
the Tribunal's view, such an effect comes closer to indirect expropriation than to a
direct taking. As a result, it will resort to the same test as the one applied to the alleged
expropriation by way of Law 42. In fact, Ecuador has argued — and Burlington has not
objected — that the following requirements needed to be met:

(i) a substantial deprivation of the value of the whole investment ("Burlington has
[] failed to demonstrate how the coactiva procedure has the alleged effect of
destroying the value of [its] entire investment";

(ii) a permanent measure ("[a]n ephemeral taking is not expropriation"); and

(iii) a measure not justified under the police power doctrine ("a State may justify
deprivations of private property on the basis of its police powers in order to

promote the general welfare and enforce its laws on its territory.”)°

b. Did the coactiva measures enforcing Law 42 expropriate Burlington's
investment?

The first coactiva seizure took place on or around 27 March 2009, when the
Consortium received notice from the coactiva judge that an oil shipment had been
seized and valued by an expert.”° On 16 July 2009, Ecuador took possession of the
fields, a new measure which, although it is part of a continuous causal chain, is
analytically independent from the coactiva measures.’ Thus, the coactiva measures
proper, i.e. those coactiva measures not overlapping with Ecuador's intervention in the
Blocks, only took place between 27 March and 15 July 2009. It is this three-and-a-half
month period that the Tribunal will address here.

Pursuant to the standard set forth above, the Tribunal must ascertain whether the
coactiva measures were a “forcible appropriation" that (i) substantially deprived
Burlington of the value of its investment, (ii) on a permanent basis, and (iii) found no
justification in the police powers doctrine.

The Tribunal must first ascertain whether the coactiva measures caused a substantial
deprivation of the value of Burlington's investment. In principle, the economic impact of
the coactiva measures should have been no greater than the economic impact of the
tax they were designed to enforce, i.e. Law 42 at 99%. As Ecuador has submitted, the

economic effect of the coactiva measures should be "economically neutral"’®':

for
every dollar of oil seized and auctioned off, a dollar of Law 42 debt would have been
extinguished. After all, in its letter of 2 July 2009, Ecuador had vouched to confine the

coactiva measures to the "oil equivalent in value to the outstanding debt."”°

In reality, the coactiva measures did not prove to be "economically neutral." They
compounded the effects of the Law 42 tax at 99%. This happened because there were
no bidders other than PetroEcuador during the various auction rounds held. As the
sole bidder, PetroEcuador consistently made below market price bids, as is allowed
under Ecuadorian law in those circumstances. The end result was that the auction

proceeds from the oil seized were consistently lower than the actual market value of
that oil.” Consequently, more oil than the "oil equivalent in value to the outstanding
debt" would have to be seized and auctioned off to cancel that Law 42 debt. In short,
the coactiva procedure as a matter of fact aggravated the economic impact of Law 42
at 99%.

The Tribunal must thus ascertain whether the compounded economic effects of the
coactiva measures, over and above the effects of Law 42 at 99%, were attributable to
Ecuador. This boils down to determine whether the absence of bidders other than
PetroEcuador during the multiple auction rounds was attributable to Ecuador.
Burlington initially conjectured that the reason for the absence of other bidders was that
“ownership of the [oil] cargoes was in dispute and subject to the provisional measure
rulings of the Burlington and Perenco tribunals.""* Apart from the witness statement of

765

Alex Martinez, ’~° there is no evidence in support of this assertion.

For its part, Ecuador countered, with evidentiary support, that the reason why no other
bidders participated in the auctions was that "the Consortium threatened to take legal
action against any company that would purchase the [seized] oil."”°° Burlington has not
denied this allegation, nor submitted evidence that would offer a different explanation
for the way in which the auctions unfolded.” Accordingly, there is no proper
evidentiary basis to attribute to Ecuador the absence of bidders other than
PetroEcuador during the auction rounds. For this reason, the Tribunal finds that the
compounded effects of the coactiva measures, over and above the effects of Law 42 at
99%, are not attributable to Ecuador.

Burlington claims that the coactiva measures were expropriatory insofar as they had
"the effect of destroying the value of [its] investments."”®° These measures would have
destroyed the value of Burlington's investment because they deprived it of the right to

Burlington did argue that "private parties submitted higher bids than PetroEcuador" at the last
recorded auction of 16 April 2010, but these bids "were invalidated by the coactiva judge" (CSM,
q 75). The Tribunal notes that this occurred only at the last auction in April 2010, that is, well
beyond the March-July 2009 period under analysis herein. In addition, Burlington has not
alleged that the invalidated bids were wrongly invalidated. Thus, this allegation is insufficient to
demonstrate that the reason why there were no bidders other than PetroEcuador during the
various auction rounds was attributable to Ecuador.

earn a revenue. The Tribunal cannot agree. Barring the issue of the absence of
bidders at the auctions — which is not attributable to Ecuador —, the economic effects of
the coactiva measures were coterminous with those of Law 42 at 99%. Since Law 42
at 99% did not deprive Burlington of the right to earn a revenue from its investment, the
same conclusion must hold true with respect to the coactiva measures. It is true that
oil seizures appear to be a more intrusive form of deprivation than tax liabilities, but
from an economic standpoint the impact of the coactiva measures is indistinguishable
from that of Law 42 at 99%.”

Burlington specifically argues that it was deprived of the right to earn a revenue, like
the investors in Benvenuti v. Congo ("Benvenuti') and in Starrett Housing v. Iran
("Starret Housing").’”° Indeed, Ecuador's coactiva measures seized Burlington's entire
oil participation share — and hence its entire revenues — for the period in which they
were in place. But this was simply because they were enforcing the sum total of
Burlington's unpaid Law 42 taxes for 2008.”"" Once these overdue taxes had been
collected, Burlington would have continued to receive its share of oil production — with
its economic value diminished by any new Law 42 taxes. At the end of the day, the
economic effect of the coactiva measures would have been no greater than that of the
Law 42 tax itself.

. In addition, neither Benvenuti nor Starret Housing are entirely apposite to this case.

While the tribunal in Benvenuti "held Congo liable for confiscating the first shipment of
bottled water" produced by the joint venture between Benvenuti and Congo, it did not
hold that such measure was expropriatory.”” In Starrett Housing, on the other hand,

In PO1, the Tribunal noted that Respondent's argument that the coactiva measures were
economically neutral relative to the Law 42 tax "misse[d] the point" (PO1, § 84). The context in
which the Tribunal made this statement bears little resemblance to the present one. The
purpose of PO1 was to provisionally forestall an aggravation of the dispute on the basis of the
Tribunal's prima facie acquaintance with the case. Because oil seizures are more intrusive than
tax liabilities, they posed a greater risk of "deteriorat[ing] the relationship" between the Parties
and thus of aggravating the dispute.

CSM, 99 91-92.

Burlington did not pay the Law 42 tax to Ecuador, but rather placed the monies directly into a
segregated account (CSM, § 33; RCM, {J 562, 590).

CSM, 9 91; S.A.A.L. Benvenuti & Bonfant v. Government of the People’s Repulic of Congo,
Award of 8 August 1980 (Exh. CL-21). In reality, Congo did not "confiscate[] the first shipment
of bottled water", as argued by Burlington. Rather, Siacongo, a State corporation, simply failed
to pay for the 800,000 bottles delivered by Plasco, the joint venture between Benvenuti and
Congo (/d., at {J 2.17, 4.38-4.40). Specifically, Benvenuti complained that "[t]he Government
did not fulfil its contractual economic obligations with respect to Plasco [...] [as it did not] take
steps to force Siacongo, a State company, to perform its contract with Plasco" (/d., at J 4.8(3)).
The issue was thus one of contract performance, not of expropriation. While there was an
expropriation claim, this claim concerned Benvenuti's shares in Plasco, not a shipment of
bottled water) (/d., at {] 4.61-62, 4.73).

the tribunal held that Iran had expropriated the claimants’ right to "collect the proceeds
of the [apartment] sales",’’* but only after finding that the claimants had been deprived
of the "effective use and control"’” of its property rights in the investment — a finding
this Tribunal has not made at this juncture. Despite the coactiva, Burlington kept
effective use and control over the Blocks, the oil wells and its subsidiary. These cases
are thus of limited assistance for purposes of this case.

Furthermore, relying on Saipem v. Bangladesh, Burlington contends that the
continuation of the coactiva process despite the Tribunal's provisional measures
“constituted an expropriation of Burlington's right under the PSCs to have this dispute
resolved by an ICSID tribunal."”” While the Tribunal certainly does not condone
Ecuador's failure to abide by the provisional measures, it cannot agree with
Burlington's contention. Even assuming Burlington had a right to ICSID arbitration
under the PSCs, quod non, the non-compliance with an order for provisional remedies,
which only creates procedural rights during the arbitration (the situation here) cannot
be assimilated to a court's decision to annul a final award (the situation in Sajpem).’”
In any event, the very fact that Burlington continues to pursue this arbitration condemns
this argument.

With respect to the purpose of the coactiva measures, Burlington also argues that the
timing and discretion of the coactiva measures show that they were in retaliation for its
adopting self-protective measures and insisting on preserving its contractual rights.’””
Ecuador objects that it did not wish to create a heavy-handed environment during
negotiations with Burlington and that the Law 42 payments were calculated and
liquidated annually, so that enforcement action could not have started in 2008.” The
Tribunal finds that both Parties' explanations are plausible and certainly not mutually
exclusive. In any event, the Tribunal regards the effects of the measures, rather than
their underlying motivation, as the dispositive consideration.

Having reached the conclusion that the coactiva measures did not effect a substantial
deprivation of Burlington's investment, it is unnecessary to review whether these
measures were permanent or not. In point of fact, what must be permanent for

purposes of expropriation is the substantial deprivation. If there is no substantial
deprivation, the question of whether such deprivation is permanent becomes moot.
This is why Burlington's reliance on Tecmed v. Mexico (""Tecmea") and Metalclad v.
Mexico ("Metalclaa’) is not entirely germane to the facts of this case.

Burlington relies on Tecmed and Metalclad to argue that ICSID tribunals "have not
countenanced a State's confiscation of the fruit that is an investor's reward for its

779

efforts. But in Tecmed, the tribunal held that measures are expropriatory only if

they are “irreversible and permanent"”®° and so deprive the investor of the "use and
enjoyment"”*' of its investment as if the right to earn revenue "had ceased to exist."”*
For its part, the Metalclad tribunal stated that Mexico's measure "permanently
prevented"”® the use of the investment and negated "the possibility of any meaningful
return", as a result of which the investor had "completely lost its investment."”* By
contrast, it cannot here be affirmed that Burlington's right to earn revenue ceased to

exist or that its investment was completely lost.

In sum, the Tribunal finds that the coactiva measures did not substantially deprive
Burlington of the value of its investment. In these circumstances, there is no need to
examine whether the effects of these measures were permanent or whether they were
justified under the police powers doctrine. For these reasons, the Tribunal cannot but
conclude that the coactiva measures did not constitute an expropriation of Burlington's
investment. Arbitrator Orrego Vicufia disagrees with this finding for the reasons
explained in the attached dissenting opinion.

3.4. Did Ecuador expropriate Burlington's investment by taking possession of

3.4.1. Burlington's position

Ecuador's physical takeover of Blocks 7 and 21 in July 2009 completely expropriated
Burlington's investment. This was the final step in a series of expropriatory
measures.”° As in Vivendi I/, Ecuador's measures rendered the investment so
unprofitable that Burlington was left with no rational choice other than to suspend

operations.”*®

Burlington submits (i) that its decision to suspend operations in the
Blocks was legally and economically justified; (ii) that Ecuador's takeover of the fields
was arbitrary as there is no evidence that there was a real risk of damage to the
Blocks; and (iii) that Ecuador's takeover of the Blocks constituted a complete and direct

expropriation of Burlington's investment.

First, Burlington argues that the suspension of operations was legally justified. It "was
a direct consequence of Ecuador's violations of its international law obligations,

including the violation of this Tribunal's Provisional Measures Order."’°”

In these
circumstances, Burlington could rely on the exceptio non adimpleti contractus,
"whereby a party to a contract may suspend performance in the event that the other
party is in breach [...]."”®

Burlington may rely on this exception under both Ecuadorian and international law.
Ecuador wrongly alleges that, as a matter of Ecuadorian law, this exception does not
apply to administrative contracts such as the PSCs. However, "Ecuador's own legal
expert, Dr. Aguilar [...] recognizes that there is no decision or legislation in Ecuador [...]
to support this."”°° Moreover, it is clear "from any logical analysis [that] hydrocarbons

production is not a public service"’®°

1

and there is thus no need to guarantee its

continuous operation.”*' Thus, Burlington argues that "the Consortium's suspension

was justified under Ecuadorian law."’°

Burlington also relies on the exceptio non adimpleti contractus as a matter of
international law.’*° International tribunals have held that this exception does apply
“when the continued operation of services becomes unreasonable in light of State

measures."”* In Azurix, the tribunal stated that it would take this exception "into

Tr. 1292:8-18. Burlington acknowledges that hydrocarbons production may be an activity "in

by noting that one does not usually receive a "monthly bill from [the] local hydrocarbons
producer" (Tr. 1292:16-18).

CSM, § 78 n. 134.

Burlington states that the legality of its decision to suspend operations cannot be negated "as
purely a question of Ecuadorian law", for that would "deny Burlington the autonomous protection
of international law and frustrate the purpose of the Treaty" (Tr. 64:9-14). It further maintained
that it is well-established that "international law prevails over domestic law" (Tr. 64:4-7).

account" despite the respondent's allegations that it did not apply.” In Vivendi II, the
tribunal held that the State had undermined the investment to the point where it was
“utterly unrealistic to suggest that" the investor "should simply have stayed put,

continuing to provide services for which it was not being paid and accepting ever

increasing losses."”*°

At any rate, the Hydrocarbons Law itself allowed the suspension of operations "for up

"797

to 30 days without just cause"”’” and "indefinitely for just cause"’® before the State

could consider terminating the PSCs. Here, Burlington's suspension was for "just

serving and should be rejected.°° The 2008 Constitution, which declared that
hydrocarbons production was a "public service" and hence not subject to suspension,
only entered into effect after foreign investors brought international claims against

Ecuador based on Law 42.°°!

Burlington further maintains that the suspension of operations was economically
justified. It was unreasonable to expect that Burlington should have continued to fund
an investment from which it could no longer derive any revenue. As a result of the
coactiva, the Consortium was responsible for all the costs and risks of production, but
received zero revenue in return.°* At the hearing, counsel for Burlington stated that,
"despite reducing operational costs to the minimum"®™, the Consortium's "costs still
totalled some $ 15 million from the first seizure of crude until the physical takeover of

the Blocks."®°° In these circumstances, Burlington had no rational choice other than to

suspend operations in the Blocks.°

Second, Burlington submits that Ecuador's physical takeover of the fields was arbitrary
as there was no real risk of damage to the Blocks.” Ecuador's evidence only shows a
theoretical risk of damage following a shut-in. However, there is also a theoretical risk
of damage when the wells are in operation. Specifically, the RPS report draws no
meaningful conclusion on the likelihood that such theoretical risks would actually

materialize. *°°

The report is, moreover, based on incomplete information,®” and its
conclusions regarding the risks of damage to the Blocks following suspension are

unsubstantiated.°"°

The Consortium planned to suspend operations using a well-developed protocol to
minimize the risk of harm. This protocol was based on the Consortium's historical

' |solation tools would

experience of suspending well operation for routine reasons.**
have prevented cross-flow, and there were no concerns of solids migrating into the
reservoir or of water incompatibility."* As Mr. Martinez declared, "it was in the best
interest of the Consortium to ensure that suspension was conducted in a proper
way."°'> Thus, the theoretical risks of damage mentioned in the RPS report did not

apply to Blocks 7 and 21.°"

The following facts belie Ecuador's alleged fears of economic and environmental
damage: (i) six months prior to the scheduled suspension, Ecuador itself asked
Burlington and Ecuador to suspend operations in response to OPEC restrictions; (ii)
recent field suspensions due to power failures showed no negative effects on either
production or the environment; and (iii) the day of the suspension Ecuador's Minister
left the country to attend celebrations in Bolivia.°’* In reality, Ecuador has raised
concerns about the risks of suspension for the first time in this arbitration only to justify
its takeover and final expropriation of Blocks 7 and 21.°"°

Third and last, Burlington argues that Ecuador's physical takeover of the Blocks was a
complete and direct expropriation of Burlington's investment. This was the final step in

Ecuador's series of unlawful expropriatory measures®” and the inevitable consequence
of Burlington's refusal to abdicate its rights under the PSCs.®"° It culminated Ecuador's
campaign to force Burlington to migrate to a legal regime that was more beneficial to
the State in times of high oil prices. As a result of this measure, Ecuador is in
possession of Burlington's entire investment.*'® Thus, although no formal decree of

expropriation was issued, the takeover was a complete and direct expropriation of

Burlington's investment.°”

3.4.2. Ecuador's position

Ecuador alleges that its intervention in the Blocks was not expropriatory.®*' On the
contrary, Burlington's illegal decision to suspend operations was a "cynical gamble"
designed to force Ecuador to intervene and thus create the appearance of direct

expropriation. — Specifically, Ecuador submits (i) that Burlington's threatened

1823 224

suspension of operations in the Blocks was illegal" and not economically justifie

(ii) that Burlington's decision threatened significant economic loss to Ecuador and other

825

serious harm to the Blocks;*~ and (iii) that the intervention was not expropriatory but

was a temporary measure adopted in response to Burlington's unlawful conduct — as
such, it was necessary, appropriate and proportionate under the circumstances. °°

First, Ecuador submits that Burlington's decision to suspend operations in the Blocks

827

was in breach of Ecuadorian law and the PSCs. Under Ecuadorian law, the

suspension of operations was contrary to the Constitution and to the Hydrocarbons
Law.®® Under the PSCs, Burlington committed to comply with Ecuadorian laws and

regulations; further, the PSC for Block 7 specifically provided that the contractor had to

Ecuadorian administrative law, Burlington was bound to perform its obligations despite
any alleged breach on the part of Ecuador.**°

Burlington had no legal justification to suspend operations in the Blocks.®*' Whether as
a matter of Ecuadorian or international law, it may not rely on the exceptio non
adimpleti contractus. As a matter of Ecuadorian law, Burlington cannot rely on this
exception because this exception does not apply to administrative contracts such as
the PSCs and because Ecuador did not breach the PSCs.%* As a matter of
international law, the cases upon which Burlington relies are distinguishable from this
case. Unlike Burlington, the investors in Azurix and Vivendi I! sought to terminate their
contract with the State and did not suspend operations because they were a party to a
public service contract.**

In addition, Burlington did not have "just cause" to suspend operations within the
meaning of the Hydrocarbons Law. Ecuador's non-compliance with the Tribunal's
recommendations could not constitute "just cause" for suspension. In fact, "the
recommendations were 'recommendations'’, i.e. not legally binding on Ecuador." * At
the hearing, Ministers Palacios, Pastor and Pinto all testified that, in Ecuador's
understanding, the Tribunal's provisional measures were recommendations and
therefore non-binding. In the caducidad decrees, Minister Pastor specifically dismissed
the Consortium's argument that there was "just cause" for suspension under the
Hydrocarbons Law.°*%

Nor was Burlington's decision to unilaterally suspend operations economically justified.

The coactiva did not leave Burlington with the "crippling prospect of continuing to

1836

operate the Blocks for the exclusive benefit of Ecuador. On the contrary, as

confirmed by Fair Links, Burlington had the financial wherewithal to continue operating
the Blocks. The Consortium placed USD 327.4 million into a segregated account after
it illegally stopped making Law 42 payments in June 2008. Those funds could have
been used to keep the Blocks in operation.®’ And as Burlington itself conceded, only

minimum investment was necessary to keep operating the Blocks after Law 42 was
passed.®*

Second, Burlington's decision to suspend operations in the Blocks threatened
significant economic loss to Ecuador and other serious and permanent harm to the
Blocks. As explained by RPS, Burlington's decision to shut down the oil wells created
four types of risk: risk of economic loss to Ecuador, and risk of reservoir, mechanical
and environmental damage.* As RPS observed, the shut-in of oil production would
have caused economic loss to Ecuador "as a result of the deferment of production and
the associated revenue."™° The extent of this loss would be a function of the length of
the shut-in and of the production rate of the wells that are shut in.’

The shut-in also threatened to cause serious and permanent reservoir, mechanical and
environmental damage to Blocks 7 and 21.8 Reservoir damage is the deterioration of
flow capacity and/or the physical loss of oil reserves. This risk was significant in Blocks
7 and 21, as most of their reservoirs are water driven.** Mechanical damage is
corrosion to the production stream of the wells, such as the wellbore tubular and
pumps.** RPS concluded that there is "little doubt" that this damage will occur to
the wells in Blocks 7 and 21. Finally, environmental damage can be caused by leaks
and spills related to the shut-in.“

Third, Ecuador submits that its intervention was not expropriatory but was rather a
temporary measure adopted in response to Burlington's unlawful conduct — as such, it
was necessary, appropriate and proportionate under the circumstances.*” In Saluka
v. Czech Republic, the tribunal held that "a deprivation can be justified if it [...] [is]
aimed at the maintenance of public order."*“® The Saluka tribunal determined that the
context of the impugned measure was "critical"®® to determine its validity. As the

State's measure in Saluka, Ecuador's intervention was permissible regulatory action
because it enforced Ecuadorian law.*°

The intervention in the Blocks merely enforced Ecuadorian law in light of Burlington's

"manifestly illegal" decision.®"

In similar circumstances, the tribunal in Payne v. Iran
recognized that a State's decision to take control of a company could be justified on the
ground that the claimant had "abandoned or [...] ceased"®** its activities. Additionally,
Ecuador's measure was necessary to avoid significant economic loss and the risk of
permanent damage to the Blocks. It was also appropriate because Ecuador entered
the Blocks without using force. It was equally proportionate as the means employed
were suited to the ends of protecting the Blocks. **

Likewise, Ecuador's intervention did not expropriate Burlington's investment because it
was intended to be temporary. In Motorola v. Iran, the tribunal held that if a State
measure is temporary and necessary on account of claimant's actions or omissions, it
cannot constitute expropriation.*°° As in Motorola, Ecuador's intervention would have
ceased once the Consortium resumed operations.® The goal of this measure was not
to permanently transfer the investor's property to the State. Accordingly, Ecuador's
intervention in the Blocks cannot constitute expropriation.°°”

3.4.3. Analysis
a. Standard for expropriation

Burlington argues that the takeover of the Blocks constituted a direct expropriation of
its investment. Ecuador does not object to reviewing the takeover under the standard
applicable to direct expropriation and the Tribunal agrees. Accordingly, a State
measure constitutes expropriation under the Treaty if (i) the measure deprives the
investor of his investment; (ii) the deprivation is permanent; and (iii) the deprivation
finds no justification under the police powers doctrine. The Tribunal will examine these
elements in reverse order.

b. Did Ecuador's taking of possession of Blocks 7 and 21 expropriate
Burlington's investment?

On 16 July 2009, Ecuador entered and took possession of Blocks 7 and 21 after
Burlington had announced, three days earlier, that operations in the Blocks would be
suspended. The Tribunal must determine whether Ecuador's taking of possession of
Blocks 7 and 21 constituted an expropriation of Burlington's investment. To that end,
the Tribunal will first review whether Ecuador's measure was justified under the police
powers doctrine. This review raises two sub-issues, namely, (i) the conditions under
which Ecuador could intervene in Blocks 7 and 21 as a result of the Consortium's
decision to suspend operations in Blocks 7 and 21, and (ii) the nature of the risks that
the Consortium's decision to suspend operations posed to Ecuador and to the Blocks.
Thereafter, the Tribunal will address (iii) the effects of Ecuador's measure on
Burlington.

(i) The conditions under which Ecuador could intervene in Blocks 7 and 21

The Tribunal agrees with Ecuador's submission that, as held in Saluka, the context of a
State measure is "critical"®* to determine the nature of the resulting deprivation. In this
case, the context of Ecuador's intervention revolves around the legality of Burlington's
decision to suspend operations. According to Burlington, the decision to suspend
operations was legally justified under Ecuadorian and international law; according to
Ecuador, the decision was in breach of Ecuadorian law, international law and the
PSCs.

Ecuadorian law governed the PSCs, which regulated in detail the rights and obligations
of Ecuador and of Burlington's subsidiary, Burlington Oriente. The Tribunal therefore
considers that Ecuadorian law should at least initially govern the question of whether
the suspension was legal. In keeping with this opinion, both Parties have expressly
relied on Ecuadorian law to argue for or against the legality of Burlington's suspension
of operations.

It is true that Burlington has also relied on the exceptio non adimpleti contractus under
international law. In the words of counsel for Burlington, this exception means that "a

party to a contract may suspend performance in the event that the other party is in

"29

breach [... However, when that contract is, as the PSCs are here, specifically

Saluka, at § 264. ("[I]nternational tribunals must consider the circumstances in which the
question [of whether there is expropriation] arises. The context within which an impugned
measure is adopted and applied is critical to the determination of its validity.") (Exh. CL-100).

Tr. 64:17-20.

511.

512.

513.

governed by the law of the host State, the issue of whether a party is in breach and,
consequently, whether the other party may suspend performance, are to be answered
initially by reference to that law.

Under Ecuadorian law, the most relevant provision on the issue of suspension of
operations is Article 74 of the Hydrocarbons Law ("Article 74"). This provision spells
out the circumstances under which the Ministry of Non-Renewable Resources (formerly
the Ministry of Energy and Mines) may terminate a hydrocarbons contract by way of a
caducidad declaration. As counsel for Ecuador explained at the hearing, "/cjaducidad
is such an important element in the participation contracts in Ecuador that the
[contracting] [p]arties expressly incorporated Article 74 [...] into the [PSCs]. It wasn't
enough to say [that] the Hydrocarbons Law applies to the [cJontract."*° Although
caducidad and the taking of possession are two different measures — one de facto, one
de jure —, the conditions under which caducidad may be declared are also relevant to
examine whether Ecuador was entitled to intervene in the Blocks by reason of an
unlawful suspension.

In its relevant part, Article 74 of the Hydrocarbons Law provides the following:

"Article 74. The Ministry of [Non-Renewable Natural Resources] may
declare the caducidad of contracts provided that the contractor:

LJ]

4. Suspends exploitation operations for more than thirty days without

just cause, previously determined by the Ministry to be so, except for

force majeure or act of God, which shall be notified to

PETROECUADOR within a ten-day period [...]"®*' (emphasis added).
Ecuador argues that the Consortium was under a legal and contractual duty to
continuously operate the Blocks. The Tribunal is not convinced that this was the case.
Under the plain terms of Article 74, the Ministry may not terminate a PSC if there is no
suspension "for more than thirty days", regardless of whether there is "just cause" for
the suspension or not. Nor may the Ministry terminate a PSC if the suspension is
longer than thirty days but there is "just cause." In brief, the Hydrocarbons Law
authorizes contractors to suspend operations without incurring the risk of caducidad for
up to 30 days, regardless of "just cause", and for more than 30 days with "just cause."

517.

The 2008 Ecuadorian Constitution does not lead to a different conclusion. It prohibits

the “suspension of [...] hydrocarbons production"®®

qua public service, but it also
provides that "the law shall establish the limits"®®* to ensure the operation of these
services. In the case of hydrocarbons production, these limits are those set in Article
74. Ecuador has not alleged that the 2008 Constitution somehow amended the scope

of the pre-existing Article 74.

According to Article 74, Ecuador has the power to declare the caducidad of a PSC by
reason of the suspension of operations, and hence eventually to intervene in the face
of a an unlawful suspension, if the suspension of operations lasts for more than 30
days.°™ This condition is not met here.

Ecuador took possession of the Blocks on 16 July 2009, the very day on which
suspension was scheduled to begin: "on 16 July 2009 — 2 hours after the scheduled
suspension [...] government officials entered the Blocks and took the necessary
measures [...] to guarantee the continuance of operations [...]."°°° By Ecuador's own
admission, the Blocks were still operating at that moment: "Blocks 7 and 21 were [] still
operating at 2 pm, on 16 July 2009."%° Ecuador submits that the suspension did not
go into effect at the scheduled time because the Consortium's employees ignored the
instructions to suspend operations.*°” Whatever the exact cause, the fact remains that
the operations were not suspended before Ecuador took possession of the Blocks. The
Consortium merely "threatened suspension",*® as Ecuador conceded in its
submissions. This is manifestly insufficient to justify caducidad and intervention under
the terms of Article 74 of the Hydrocarbons Law.

Moreover, even if the suspension of operations had occurred and lasted more than 30
days,°® the Tribunal would have concluded that the Consortium had "just cause". This

This is an essential but not a sufficient condition for a caducidad declaration. In addition to a
more than 30-day suspension, the contractor must have no "just cause" for suspension. Hence,
the contractor can suspend operations for more 30 days without being subject to caducidad on
condition that it has "just cause" to do so.

At the time the Consortium took the decision to suspend operations, it was unclear how long the
suspension would last. The evidence suggests, however, that the Consortium was prepared to
suspend operations for a period longer than 30 days (Tr. 519:7-22).

172

follows from a review of the events preceding the suspension: Ecuador enacted the
Law 42 tax, failed to absorb its effects as it should have done pursuant to its
commitments under the PSCs, and eventually collected the tax by way of seizures and
auctions. Hence, even if the suspension had lasted more than 30 days, Ecuador would
not have been entitled to intervene in the Blocks.

Having reached the conclusion that the conditions for an intervention under Article 74
of the Hydrocarbons Law were not fulfilled, the Tribunal can dispense with analyzing
whether Burlington could also rely on the exceptio non adimpleti contractus under
Ecuadorian or international law. Nor is it necessary to establish whether Burlington's
decision to suspend was economically justified for purposes of this analysis.

(ii) | Risks resulting from the suspension of operations

The Tribunal must now examine the nature of the risks that Burlington's decision to
suspend operations posed to Ecuador and to the Blocks. [Ecuador claims that it
intervened in the Blocks in order to avoid incurring significant economic losses and
serious and permanent damage to the Blocks. Burlington, on the other hand, submits
that Ecuador's allegations are not properly substantiated and that the theoretical risks
of damage identified in the RPS report did not apply to Blocks 7 and 21. The Tribunal
is not persuaded that the suspension posed such a significant risk of damage as to
justify Ecuador's immediate intervention.

The Tribunal notes that (i) RPS did not conclude that there was a significant risk of
damage, but rather a "potentially" significant risk of damage; (ii) RPS's conclusions are
admittedly based on incomplete information; (iii) the evidence suggests that the risks of
reservoir and mechanical damage required an extended suspension, such that an
immediate intervention in the Blocks would not have been warranted; (iv) the evidence
does not show that there was a significant risk of environmental damage; and (v) the
evidence does not suggest that the risk of economic loss was such as to justify the
intervention. These considerations are expanded upon below.

First, RPS did not conclude that the Consortium's suspension would have caused
significant risk of damage, but rather "potentially" significant risk of damage. In its
conclusions, RPS stated that shutting in producing wells caused a "potentially
"870

significan' risk of reservoir and well damage. Furthermore, at the hearing, Mr. Gene

Wiggins, testifying on behalf of RPS, emphasized the potential nature of the risk:

RPS ER, § 144 (5th bullet point).

173

522.

523.

"[Mr Yanos]: Now, you sum up all your thinking on the issue of the

significance of these risks [of suspension] in the last bullet [of the RPS

Report], and your conclusion, as | understand it, is that each of the

four categories of risks that we went through in the previous bullets
add up to a significant risk, is that correct?

[Mr Wiggins]: Potentially a significant risk, yes.

[Mr Yanos]: Potentially, right""’’ (emphasis added).

Second, the Tribunal notes that the RPS report is based on incomplete information.
Specifically, it contains the following caveat with respect to the risk of reduced oil
recovery owing to the encroachment from aquifer water: "Further study beyond the
scope of this report is necessary to quantify the damage that will occur as a result of
this phenomenon [...]."°” Similar caveats are included in connection with other risks of
reservoir, mechanical and environmental damage.*” On cross-examination, Mr.
Wiggins acknowledged that the word "potentially" was used because, in order to reach
amore conclusive opinion, he would have to "look at the complete dataset and develop
a more comprehensive understanding about what's going on."°”4

Similarly, there was some uncertainty about the reliability of the tests employed for the
report. Ecuador submitted evidence of a trend showing a lower oil production rate in
the Mono fields 1, 4 and 11 following a community strike between 27 October and 12
November 2006.°” The Tribunal notes that the descending trend in Mono field 1
appears to be the continuation of a trend that predated the shut-in; in Mono 4, the
production rate dropped to approximately 2004-2005 levels; and in Mono 11, the
production rate actually increased immediately after the shut-in, before plummeting
shortly thereafter to approximately 2003 production levels.®° Referring to this
evidence, Mr. Wiggins stated on direct examination that:

"[IInherent inaccuracies [] may exist in the data set that we deal with.
We do not have flow gauges on the wells measuring production. The
way the process works is [...] operators conduct intermittent tests; and,
then on the basis of those tests, production is allocated to a well for a
given month. So, it's--there can be some error that comes about by
virtue of the tests, how they were performed, whether they were
performed properly, whether they were representative"’”” (emphasis
added).

524. Third, the evidence suggests that the risks of reservoir and mechanical damage would

526.

not have materialized before an extended suspension, so that an immediate
intervention in the Blocks would not have been warranted. With respect to the risk of
reservoir damage due to aquifer water encroachment, the RPS report refers to a study
which states that this type of damage may occur after "a prolonged production

shutdown"®”®

(emphasis added). This bolsters Mr. Martinez's testimony to the effect
that the risk of aquifer water encroachment "takes a very long time"®”’ to come to pass.
The RPS report appears to echo this when it concludes that the extent of this damage
will "depend on the duration of the shut-in period."®®° Likewise, in relation to another
risk of reservoir damage, another study quoted by RPS notes that "scale commonly
forms after long periods of well shut-in [...]."°°"

RPS's evidence props up a similar conclusion with respect to the risk of mechanical
damage. On direct examination, Mr. Wiggins explained that he was familiar with oil
fields which were shut-in and experienced corrosion “after a period of years". He
concluded that if, after a shut-in, the oil well equipment is "left down-hole for an
extended period of time, there are just very much limits to what [one] can do from a

corrosion inhibition standpoint"®®

(emphasis added). Thus, the evidence does not
support the proposition that the suspension of operations would have caused an

immediate risk of reservoir and mechanical damage.

Fourth, the evidence does not suggest that there was a significant risk of environmental
damage. As stated in the RPS report and readily admitted by Mr. Wiggins on cross-
examination, two factors create a risk of environmental damage: naturally flowing wells
and lack of supervision that could cause leaks or spills.°°* However, at the time of the
scheduled suspension, only 2 of the 88 active wells in Blocks 7 and 21 were naturally
flowing wells. In addition, the evidence shows that the Consortium was to keep
personnel on the ground throughout the suspension.®° The Tribunal is thus
unconvinced that the suspension would have created a significant risk of environmental
damage.

530.

Finally, Ecuador also relies on a risk of economic loss.®* It is true that a suspension of
operations will generally produce a loss of revenues. Yet, there is no evidence of its
magnitude nor of the period during which it would have accrued. Moreover, at the
beginning of its direct examination, RPS qualified its conclusion that economic loss will
“invariably result"®’ from a suspension of operations by noting that this conclusion
"assumed a fairly constant oil price."®°* This clarification was an implicit acceptance of
Mr. Martinez's testimony to the effect that the economic consequences of a shut-in
depend "on the economics of the future price of crude."®®° In conclusion, the Tribunal is
not persuaded that this risk was significant enough to justify the takeover.

Therefore, the evidence does not persuasively establish that the suspension of
operations would have created a significant risk of damage. Accordingly, the Tribunal
finds that Ecuador's immediate intervention in the Blocks may not be justified on the
ground that it was necessary to prevent serious and permanent damage to the Blocks.

For these reasons, the Tribunal deems that Ecuador's entry and taking of possession
of the Blocks was not justified under the police powers doctrine because (i) At the time
of the taking of possession of the Blocks, Burlington's decision to suspend operations
was legally justified as a matter of Ecuadorian law and (ii) the evidence does not show
that Ecuador's immediate intervention in the Blocks was necessary to prevent serious
and significant damage to the Blocks. The next question is to gauge the effects of
Ecuador's occupation of the Blocks on Burlington.

(iii) The effects of Ecuador's intervention in the Blocks

As a purely factual matter, Ecuador's entry into and occupation of Blocks 7 and 21
dispossessed Burlington of the oil fields. Such dispossession deprived Burlington not
only of its oil production share — and thus of its revenues — but also of the means of
production that made those revenues possible. In a nutshell, the occupation of the
Blocks deprived Burlington of all the tangible property embodying its investment in
Ecuador. While Burlington still had its subsidiary's rights in the PSCs as well as the
subsidiary’s shares, these rights and shares had no value without possession of the oil
fields and access to the oil.

532.

533.

534.

Therefore, once Ecuador entered the oil fields, Burlington could no longer be deemed
to exercise "effective use and control" over its investment. Ecuador argues that the
takeover was not expropriatory because it was intended to be a temporary measure
which would have ceased once the Consortium accepted to resume operations. The
Consortium, however, was under no obligation to resume operations. On the contrary,
as previously concluded, Burlington — and hence the Consortium — was entitled to
suspend operations for 30 days without cause and had "just cause" to suspend
operations for more than 30 days.

It is nevertheless true that Ecuador's occupation of the Blocks was not a permanent
measure from the outset. Indeed, in the weeks following the occupation of the Blocks,
Ecuador continued to communicate with the Consortium with a view to handing back
possession of the Blocks on condition that the Consortium were to resume operations.
At that time, there still appeared to be — in the words of the tribunal in Sedco v. Iran— a
“reasonable prospect" that the investor could "return [to] control"®® its investment. As
long as there was such prospect, Ecuador's occupation could not be deemed to be a
permanent measure.

On 19 August 2009, little over a month after Ecuador's occupation of the Blocks, the
Minister of Mines and Oil, Germanico Pinto, sent a letter to the Consortium urging it to
resume operations "within a maximum period of ten (10) days."®*' However, this
demand was inconsistent with Burlington's right to suspend operations with "just cause"
on account of Ecuador's breaches of the PSCs and of provisional measures order. As
Ecuador had by that time neither cured those breaches nor expressed an intent to do
so, Burlington still had "just cause" to suspend operations. In other words, the status
quo at the time of this demand was no different from that which had given rise to
Burlington's right to suspend operations with "just cause" to begin with. Therefore,
Burlington had no obligation to accept Ecuador's demand.

On 28 August 2009, the Consortium answered that it "would be prepared to resume"**

1893

operations provided that Ecuador came "into full compliance with its legal and

contractual obligations. There is no evidence that Ecuador responded to this letter or
further communicated with the Consortium in relation to the possible resumption of

operations. Thus, Minister Pinto's letter of 19 August 2009, with its 10-day time limit, is
the last evidence on record showing that Ecuador still entertained the possibility that
the Consortium could regain possession of the Blocks.

On this basis, the Tribunal deems that, by the end of the 10-day period mentioned in
Minister Pinto's letter of 19 August 2009, the possibility that the Consortium could
resume operations, and hence that Burlington could regain control of the Blocks, had
vanished altogether. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that Ecuador's takeover of the
Blocks became a permanent measure on 30 August 2009. As of this date, Ecuador
deprived Burlington of the effective use and control of Blocks 7 and 21 on a permanent
basis, and thus expropriated its investment.

Ecuador argues that the takeover of the Blocks did not affect the rights of Burlington's
subsidiary under the PSCs. Even though these contract rights were still nominally in
force after the takeover — as caducidad would not be declared until almost a year later,
in July 2010 -, they were bereft of any real value from the moment Burlington
permanently lost effective use and control of its investment. The termination of the
PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 through the caducidad process in July 2010 merely
formalized an already prevailing state of affairs, but is otherwise irrelevant for purposes
of the expropriation analysis. As a result, the Tribunal will dispense with reviewing the
specific submissions and arguments made in relation to caducidad.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Ecuador's physical occupation
of Blocks 7 and 21 expropriated Burlington's investment as of 30 August 2009. This
being so, the next question that arises is whether this expropriation was unlawful. But
prior to the examination of this question, the Tribunal will briefly address Burlington's
submission that this is a case of creeping expropriation.

In light of the conclusion that the physical occupation effected an expropriation, the
Tribunal does not believe that Ecuador's measures taken together constituted a
creeping expropriation. As previously noted, creeping expropriation only exists when
"none" of the challenged measures separately constitutes expropriation. In this case,
the physical takeover of the Blocks does constitute expropriation in and of itself. In
Vivendi II, for instance, no single measure was deemed to be individually expropriatory;
specifically, there was no physical takeover of the investor's operations. Vivendi II is
thus distinguishable from this case. Hence, the definition of creeping expropriation
does not appear to fit the facts of this case.

178

539. Burlington has relied on Revere Copper to suggest that finding expropriation at the time

540.

541.

of the physical takeover was too late, since the expropriation had commenced at an
earlier stage. In Revere Copper, the tribunal held that it would be too "narrow"®™*
interpretation to require physical impact to make a finding of expropriation. On the

basis of this precedent, counsel for Burlington argued at the hearing that:

"What is significant for our purposes is the Tribunal's recognition that

the cumulative impact of the inability to make rational decisions

related to an investment can be as harmful to an investor as a

physical, outright, troops-in weapons-out expropriation. An investor

should not have to operate under conditions that substantially deprive

it of the benefit of its investment before crying foul."°°°
The Tribunal takes no issue with this general statement, but considers that it has no
application to this case. As was previously concluded, Burlington was not operating
under conditions of substantial deprivation before Ecuador physically occupied the
Blocks. Nor is it possible to conclude that before that point Burlington had lost its ability
to "make rational decisions." By way of example, Burlington's decision to place the
contested Law 42 payments into a segregated account while continuing to negotiate
with Ecuador is but one token that such ability had not been annihilated. Accordingly,
the Tribunal does not believe that this is a case of creeping expropriation.

4. Was Ecuador's Expropriation Unlawful?

rational decisions in fact trigger this subsection? Must one wait until there has occurred
something akin to the troops coming in, little by little or all at once, in a nineteenth century
sense? Must there be some physical impact? In our view such narrow interpretation of the

unfair and inequitable, arbitrary, and in contravention of Ecuador's specific obligations
to Burlington — in particular, the tax absorption clauses.°°

According to Ecuador, if there was expropriation, it was not unlawful.°° — First,
Ecuador's failure to pay compensation does not render the alleged expropriation
unlawful because it is disputed whether there was an expropriation in the first place. If
it is not first established that there was in fact expropriation, there is no duty to offer
compensation.°" In Goetz v. Burundi, the tribunal refused to characterize the taking as
unlawful because, in Ecuador's words, the State "had not yet been given an opportunity

902

to fulfill the condition of compensation.’ Second, at any rate, the alleged

expropriation was not carried out in a manner that was unfair and inequitable, arbitrary,
or in contravention of Ecuador's obligations to Burlington.°°°

4.2. Analysis

It is undisputed that Ecuador has neither paid nor offered compensation to Burlington.
Many tribunals have held that the lack of payment is sufficient for the expropriation to
be deemed unlawful.° Ecuador asserts that it offered no compensation to Burlington
because it was disputed whether there was expropriation at all. While this may have
been true at the time of Law 42 and the coactiva, there can be no legitimate dispute
that Ecuador appropriated for itself the benefits of Burlington's investment from the time
of the physical takeover. There can be no dispute either that Ecuador was aware that
compensation was due, for it offered to pay compensation to other oil companies when
it took over their operations.°°%°

At the hearing, counsel for Burlington stated that "in this one case, in this one case alone and
that of Burlington's partner Perenco, Ecuador claims that no compensation needs to be paid. It
argues that it may [...] benefit a hundred percent from the future sales of oil produced as a
consequence of the massive investments [...] whilst at the same time in the most recent law, the
law of [July] 2010 [], those other Contractors who have had their contracts terminated because
they refused to move to a Service Contract recognized that compensation is to be payable." (Tr.

In spite of these considerations, Ecuador made no offer of compensation. The fact
thus remains that Ecuador made no “prompt, adequate and effective” payment to
compensate for the expropriation of Burlington's investment. Ecuador's reliance on
Goetz v. Burundi,°°° in which the Tribunal gave the State the option between paying
compensation or withdrawing the expropriatory measure, does not change this fact. At
any rate, nothing prevents Ecuador from making an offer after this decision, and
possibly reaching a settlement with Burlington which would put an end to this
arbitration.

Accordingly, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that Ecuador's expropriation was

unlawful.

Antoine Goetz and others v. Republic of Burundi, Award of 10 February 1999 (Exh. EL-22).
Ecuador relied on this precedent in its original pleading; it did not insist on its application either
at the hearing or in its post-hearing brief.
