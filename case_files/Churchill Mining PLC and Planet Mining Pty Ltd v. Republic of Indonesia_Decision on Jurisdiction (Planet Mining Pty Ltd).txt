THE FACTS

This section summarizes the facts of this dispute insofar as they bear relevance to
Indonesia’s objections to jurisdiction. Unless otherwise stated, the facts are undisputed.

Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 4 of 18 March 2013, the present arbitration was
consolidated with ICSID arbitration ARB/12/14 initiated by Churchill. It was left open
whether the Tribunal would render one or two decisions on jurisdiction or awards. The
Tribunal has decided to issue two separate decisions (see below { 83). The facts and the
procedural history are largely identical in both cases.

THE EAST KUTAI COAL PROJECT

The East Kutai Coal Project (the “EKCP”) is a mining project developed by the Claimant
jointly with various Indonesian companies in the Regency of East Kutai on the island of
Kalimantan in Indonesia. According to various sources, the area encompassing the EKCP
hosts the seventh largest coal deposit on the planet and the second largest coal deposit in
Indonesia.’ The Claimant asserts that through surveys conducted over several years, it
has confirmed the existence of approximately 2.7 billion metric tons of coal in the EKCP
area.

The coal found there is classified as high-quality sub-bituminous coal with very low sulphur
and ash content.’ According to the Claimant, this high-quality coal is ideally suited for the
new generation power stations which have been developed lately in countries like India
and China and are also in high demand in Europe because of their reduced environmental
impact.>

Relying on a Feasibility Study modeling an evaluation of the EKCP for an initial 25-year
period,* the Claimant indicates that the project has a pre-tax net present value of
approximately USD 1.8 billion and pre-tax cash flows in excess of USD 500 million per
year over the first 20 years of capacity production.

On 10 March 2005, the Regent of East Kutai issued three so-called KP Exploration
Licenses to PT Nusantara Wahau Coal (“PT NWC”),° PT Kaltim Nusantara Coal
(“PT KNC’),® and PT Batubara Nusantara Kaltim (“PT BNK”)’ (together the “Nusantara
companies”) over areas that coincide with the future EKCP.

THE 2005 BKPM APPROVAL OF PT INDONESIA COAL DEVELOPMENT

On 23 November 2005, the Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board (“BKPM”) delivered
an authorization to PT Indonesian Coal Development (“PT ICD”) to be incorporated as an
Indonesian foreign direct-investment company (a so-called “PMA”) and to conduct
business in the mining sector in Indonesia (the “2005 BKPM Approval”).® PT ICD was
initially created by Profit Point Group Ltd, a company incorporated in the British Virgin
Islands, and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi, an Indonesian citizen and co-founder of the Ridlatama
group.° The authorized capital of PT ICD is Rupiah (“Rp.”) 2,512,500,000, divided into
250,000 shares, with a nominal value of Rp. 10,050 per share."° Profit Point Group Ltd
acquired 237,500 shares and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi 12,500 shares."

According to the 2005 BKPM Approval, PT ICD could engage in general mining supporting

services, i.e., “consultancy in relation to business planning for construction of building and

other facilities in the domain of general mining projects”. '*

Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval contains a dispute settlement clause making
reference to ICSID arbitration in the following terms:

“In the event of dispute between the company and the Government of
the Republic of Indonesia which cannot be settled by
consultation/deliberation, the Government of Indonesia is
prepared/ready to follow settlement according to provisions of the

Exploration Business License for Nusantara Wahau Coal, Decision No. 80/02.188.45/HK/III/2005

CHURCHILL AND PLANET’S ACQUISITION OF SHARES IN PT ICD AND THE 2006 BKPM
APPROVAL

In 2006, an Indonesian group of companies, the Ridlatama group, introduced the EKCP to
Churchill and Planet, who decided to invest in the project because they considered it
promising. As a first step, Churchill and Planet entered into discussions with Ridlatama
about acquiring PT ICD.

On 24 April 2006, Churchill and Planet acquired the shares in PT ICD from the initial
shareholders, Profit Point Group Ltd and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi.'® Churchill acquired a 95%
stake in PT ICD, while Planet acquired the remaining 5%. On 8 May 2006, the BKPM
approved the change in PT ICD’s shareholding (the “2006 BKPM Approval”).'®

The 2006 BKPM Approval incorporated by reference the terms of the 2005 BKPM
Approval, stating that “[t]his Letter of Approval is an integral part of Foreign Capital
Investment Approval Letter No. 1304/l/PMA/2005 dated 23 November 2005”."”

On 31 August 2007, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and the Investment
Coordinating Board decided to grant PT ICD a Permanent Business License to undertake
general mining supporting services. ®

According to Indonesia, PT ICD was to report on the change in its shareholding to the
Minister of Law and Human Rights. This was done, again according to Indonesia, on
8 April 2008.

THE RIDLATAMA GROUP AND THE 2007 KP GENERAL SURVEY BUSINESS LICENSES

The Ridlatama group consists of seven companies incorporated in Indonesia and owned or
controlled by four Indonesian individuals: Messrs. Andreas Rinaldi and Anang Mudjiantoro,
and their wives, Mmes. Ani Setiawan Rinaldi (“Setiawan”) and Florita.'® The seven
companies are (1) PT Ridlatama Tambang Mineral (“PT RTM”), (2) PT Ridlatama Trade
Powerindo (“PT RTP”), (3) PT Ridlatama Steel (“PT RS”), (4) PT Ridlatama Power
(‘PT RP”), (5) PT Investama Resources (“PT IR’), (6) PT Investama Nusa Persada
(“PR INP”), and (7) PT Techno Coal Utama Prima (“PT TCUP”) (together the “Ridlatama
companies’).

Of the seven Ridlatama companies, the first six successively obtained mining licenses for
the area covering the EKCP. PT TCUP was initially established on 21 November 2006,
being authorized to engage in geological and mining services.

On 12 February 2007, PT RS and PT RP were granted by the Regent of East Kutai (the
“Regent”), and in accordance with 1967 Mining Law,” two General Survey Business
Licenses in two blocks of the EKCP area,” covering an area of approximately 400 square
kilometers situated approximately 110 kilometers northwest of Sangatta.”* According to
Planet, the licenses lapsed in 2008 and the two companies became dormant because no
sufficient coal deposits were found.”* In any event, these two concessions did not overlap
with any of the Nusantara concession areas (which according to Planet had expired in
March 2006), so no dispute arose between the Parties over these two concessions.”*

On 24 May 2007, PT RTM and PT RTP obtained from the Regent two General Survey
Business Licenses in the EKCP area,” and on 29 November 2007, PT IR and PT INP also
obtained General Survey Business Licenses,” increasing the EKCP area to approximately
775 square kilometers.””

On 25 May 2007, following the issuance of the General Survey Business Licenses to
PT RTM and PT RTP, Churchill and Planet, through PT ICD, entered into a Cooperation
Agreement with PT RTM, PT RTP, PT RS, PT RP, and PT TCUP;” and an Investors
Agreement with PT RTM, PT RTP, PT RS, PT RP, PT TCUP, Mmes. Setiawan and
Florita.”° At that point in time, Mmes. Setiawan and Florita held all shares in PT RTM,
PT RTP, PT RS and PT RP. On the same date, Mmes. Setiawan and Florita also
concluded Pledge of Shares Agreements with PT ICD, and PT RTM, PT RTP, PT RS, and
PT RP.*

The Cooperation Agreement concerned, inter alia, PT ICD’s obligation to “fully plan, set up
and perform all mining operations” in the EKCP area covered by the mining licenses of
PT RTM, PT RTP, PT RS and PT RP, in exchange for 75% of the generated revenue."
The Investors Agreement concerned primarily PT ICD’s control over future transfers of
shares in PT TCUP, PT RTM, PT RTP, PT RS, and PT RP.” The Pledge of Shares

Agreements served as security for the contractual rights enshrined in the Cooperation and
Investors Agreements.**

On 26 November 2007, through a Deed Grant of Shares, Mmes. Florita and Setiawan
transferred their shares in PT RTM and PT RTP to PT TCUP. Accordingly, PT TCUP held
henceforth 75% of the shares in these two companies.

On 28 November 2007, PT ICD entered into a new Cooperation Agreement with PT RTM,
PT RTP, PT RS, and PT RP,*° a new Investors Agreement with PT TCUP, PT RTM,
PT RTP, PT RS, PT RP, Mmes. Florita and Setiawan,*° and new Pledge of Shares
Agreements” in replacement of the different agreements entered into on 25 May 2007.
As previously, PT ICD entered into these agreements with the primary aim of securing
PT ICD’s contractual right to 75% of the revenues generated from mining operations in the
EKCP area covered by the licenses held by PT RTM, PT RTP, PT RS and PT RP.

On 31 March 2008, PT ICD concluded a Cooperation Agreement with PT IR and PT INP,

THE 2008 KP EXPLORATION LICENSES

After having obtained the issuance of General Survey Business Licenses during the year
of 2007, PT RTM, PT RTP, PT IR and PT INP filed applications on 10 March 2008 to
upgrade their existing KP General Survey Business Licenses to KP Exploration Licenses. ®
On 8 April 2008, the Regent of East Kutai approved co-operation between each of the

license-holding companies of the Ridlatama group and PT ICD “to conduct exploration,

exploitation, processing and refinery, sales and transportation of coal minerals”.“*

On 9 April 2008, the Regent of East Kutai delivered KP Exploration Licenses to PT RTM,
PT RTP, PT IR and PT INP.*° The term of the KP Exploration Licenses was three years
with the possibility of two one-year extensions, for a total of five years. The KP Exploration

Licenses “allowed detailed surveys, including drilling and the definition of the mining

resource”.*®

THE 2009 IUP EXPLOITATION LICENSES

On 12 January 2009, the Republic of Indonesia promulgated Law No. 4/2009 concerning

Mining of Mineral and Coal.*”

Together with the implementing Regulation No. 23/2009 of
1 February 2009, this law adopted a new system of licensing through Mining Undertaking

Licenses (“IUP”), abolishing the previous regime of KP Licenses.

On 23 March 2009, PT RTM, PT RTP, PT IR and PT INP sent application letters to the
Regent to have their exploration licenses upgraded to exploitation licenses and to conform
to the new legislative framework. On 27 March 2009, the Regent granted these four
companies an upgrade of their licenses and issued IUP Exploitation Licenses.*®

The IUP Exploitation Licenses are granted for performing construction, mining, processing,
refining, hauling, and selling the resource for an initial term of 20 years with the possibility
of two 10-year extensions.

THE 2010 REVOCATION DECREES

As previously stated, the Regent had apparently already granted on 10 March 2005
KP Exploration Licenses over an area substantially overlapping with the EKCP area to the
three Nusantara companies, PT Batubara Nusantara Coal, PT Kaltim Nusantara Coal, and
PT Nusantara Wahau Coal.*® These licenses were extended for the first time by the

Regent on 17 July 2008,” and again on 18 February 2010."

On 21 April 2010, the Ministry of Forestry dispatched a letter to the Regent of East Kutai
recommending the revocation/cancellation of the Ridlatama companies’ licenses in the
EKCP area because (1) the Ridlatama companies were operating without permission from
the Ministry of Forestry; (2) the Ridlatama licenses were allegedly forged; and (3) the
Ridlatama licenses overlapped with other permit areas.

It is in this context that, on 4 May 2010, the Regent of East Kutai issued four Revocation
Decrees of the IUP exploitation licenses held by PT RTM, PT RTP, PT IR and PT INP,
relying on the letter that he had received from the Ministry of Forestry on 21 April 2010 and
on a 30 April 2010 report from the East Kutai Department of Mines.°°

On 17 February 2012, the Ridlatama group wrote to the Ministry of Forestry requesting a
clarification of the 21 April 2010 letter.°* The Ministry of Forestry responded on
5 March 2012 that the April letter was only an “initial information” and that “the decision to

revoke mining license (IUP) by the East Kutai Bupati [i.e., the Regent], which was based

solely on the Ministry Letter was not correct”.®®

approved the change in the share structure of these companies.** On 19 March 2010, the
shareholders of PT TCUP voted unanimously in favor of PT ICD’s entry as majority
shareholder. On 30 March 2010, PT TCUP obtained the BKPM Approval to operate as a
PMA company, i.e., to have foreign shareholders.®° On 16 April 2010, PT TCUP amended

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

INITIAL PHASE

The present arbitration is between Planet and Indonesia. Their dispute is brought before
the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”), under the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of
Other States (the “ICSID Convention”) and the Agreement between the Government of
Australia and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for the Promotion and
Protection of Investments dated 17 November 1992 (the “Australia-Indonesia BIT”, the
“Treaty”, or the “BIT”).® A parallel ICSID arbitration was initiated by Churchill, a British
mining company, against Indonesia essentially regarding the same set of facts. That
dispute is brought under the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Indonesia for the Promotion and

Protection of Investments dated 27 April 1976 (the “UK-Indonesia BIT”). Eventually, the
parties to these two proceedings agreed to consolidate the two arbitrations (see below
159).

For purposes of clarity, the present section will first address the initiation of ICSID Case
No. ARB/12/40 by Planet, followed by a brief outline of the initiation of ICSID Case No.
ARB/12/14 by Churchill, and then conclude with the procedural steps involved in the
decision to consolidate both cases.

1. Initiation of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/40

On 4 October 2012, Planet sent a Notification of Dispute to the Republic of Indonesia.
Therein, Planet proposed to Indonesia to agree (i) that the Tribunal appointed in ICSID
Case No. ARB/12/14 between Churchill and Indonesia also resolve the dispute submitted
by Planet, and (ii) that both disputes be resolved in consolidated proceedings. The
Notification letter remained without response.

On 26 November 2012, Planet filed a Request for Arbitration with ICSID pursuant to Article
36 of the ICSID Convention and the Australia-Indonesia BIT. Planet invoked breaches of
Articles II(2), II(3), IV and IV of the BIT and claimed financial compensation to be specified
in due course.*”

Planet also reiterated its proposal that the Tribunal constituted in the arbitration initiated by
Churchill resolve the present dispute and that the proceedings be consolidated. ®*

On 26 December 2012, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered Planet's Request
for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On 8 January 2013,
Indonesia informed the Centre that it agreed to Planet's proposal that Churchill's and
Planet's claims be heard by the same Tribunal. On 11 January 2013, the Centre took note
of the Parties’ confirmations of their agreement on the constitution of the Tribunal, i.e., that
the Tribunal was to be constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID
Convention and shall consist of Professor Albert van den Berg, a Dutch national,
Mr. Michael Hwang S.C., a Singaporean national, and Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-

Kohler, a Swiss national, as the President of the Tribunal. On 22 January 2013, the
Secretary-General of the Centre informed the Parties that Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-
Kohler, Mr. Michael Hwang S.C., and Professor Albert Jan van den Berg, had accepted
their appointments as arbitrators and the Tribunal had been duly constituted in Case
No. ARB/12/40. On the same date, the Centre designated Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu as
Secretary of the Tribunal.

2. Initiation of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14

On 22 May 2012, Churchill filed a Request for Arbitration with ICSID pursuant to Article 36
of the ICSID Convention and the UK-Indonesia BIT. On 22 June 2012, the
Secretary-General of the Centre registered Churchill’s Request for Arbitration pursuant to
Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On 14 September 2012, Indonesia requested that
the Arbitral Tribunal in that case be constituted pursuant to the formula provided by Article
37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. On 19 September 2012, Professor van den Berg
accepted his appointment as the Claimant-appointed arbitrator, followed by
Mr. Michael Hwang’s acceptance as the Respondent-appointed arbitrator on
21 September 2012 and Professor Kaufmann-Kohler’s acceptance as President of the
Tribunal on 3 October 2012. Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 was
constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) and the proceedings commenced on
3 October 2012. On the same date, the Centre designated Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu as
Secretary of the Tribunal. After having obtained the agreement of the Parties, the Tribunal
informed the Parties through its Secretary by letter of 5 February 2013 that the
appointment of Mr. Magnus Jesko Langer as Assistant to the Tribunal had become
effective.

On 27 November 2012, the Tribunal and the Parties held the first session by video link. On
6 December 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 containing the schedule of
submissions for the jurisdictional phase. It was decided that a hearing on jurisdiction would
take place in Singapore on 13 May 2013, May 14 being kept as a reserve day.

On 5 February 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 denying a petition by the
Government of the Regency of East Kutai to be joined to the proceedings. On
22 November 2012, Indonesia filed a Request for Provisional Measures and a Document

Production Request in connection with jurisdiction. On 4 March 2013, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 3 denying the provisional measures sought by Indonesia.

With respect to the Document Production Request, Churchill undertook to produce the
requested documents with its first memorial. Having heard the Parties, the Tribunal
ordered Churchill to produce the requested documents together with an explanatory note
by 17 December 2012, which Churchill did.

On 27 February 2013, Churchill submitted to the Tribunal an amended Request for
Arbitration seeking to add PT Indonesia Coal Development (PT ICD) as a claimant in
ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14. On 4 March 2013, the Tribunal denied Churchill’s request to
join PT ICD to the proceedings.

3. Consolidation

The Tribunal and the Parties in ICSID Cases No. ARB/12/14 and ARB/12/40 held a
common session by video link on 1 March 2013, which was sound and video recorded.
Besides serving as the first session in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/40 pursuant to Rule 13 of
the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the common session addressed consolidation. Having
secured the agreement in principle of the Parties that the two disputes be heard in a
consolidated case,® the Tribunal heard the Parties on the modalities of consolidation. The
Tribunal noted that the Parties agreed to join the two proceedings in all respects, but
disagreed on whether the Tribunal should render one joint decision/award in respect of
both Churchill and Planet or two separate decisions/awards, one in respect of each
claimant.

In Procedural Order No. 4 of 18 March 2013, the Tribunal confirmed the content of the
common session. With regard to the modalities of the consolidated proceedings, it decided
that the procedural calendar under Annex 3 to Procedural Order No. 1, amended by letter
of 21 February 2013 and supplemented by letter of 1 March 2013, would govern; that the
Tribunal’s orders issued as of the date of the common session would apply to all three
Parties, with the exception of Procedural Order No. 3 dealing with Indonesia’s request for
provisional measures in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14; that the Centre would maintain only

Indonesia’s letter of 4 January 2013.

one case account; and that Mr. Magnus Jesko Langer would serve as Assistant to the
Tribunal in the consolidated proceedings.

Further, the Tribunal noted that it would decide whether to render one or two
decisions/awards at a later stage, after consultation with the involved parties.

WRITTEN PHASE ON JURISDICTION

In paragraph 14.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, as amended by the Tribunal's letter of
21 February 2013, and recorded in Procedural Order No. 4, the Tribunal set the following
schedule for the jurisdictional phase:
(i) Churchill and Planet would file their Memorial by 13 March 2013;
(ii) | the Respondent would file its Objections to Jurisdiction by 8 April 2013;
(iii) Churchill and Planet would file their Response to the Objections to
Jurisdiction by 30 April 2013; and
(iv) the Respondent would file a Reply to the Response to the Objections to
Jurisdiction by 6 May 2013.

During the common session of 1 March 2013, the Respondent stated that it intended to
make additional document requests in connection with jurisdiction. After having heard the
views of Churchill and Planet, the Tribunal established the following schedule for document
production in a letter of 1 March 2013, confirmed in Procedural Order No. 4:

(i) the Respondent would file its Request by 6 March 2013;

(ii) | Churchill and Planet would state their Response to the Request and any
objections thereto by 11 March 2013;

(iii) the Respondent would respond to the aforementioned objections, if any, by
14 March 2013;

(iv) the Tribunal would rule on the objections, if any, by 19 March 2013; and

(v) Churchill and Planet would produce those documents for which no
objection has been sustained by the Tribunal by 22 March 2013.

On 19 March 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 ruling on the objections to
the document production request submitted by Churchill and Planet. By letter of
22 March 2013, Churchill and Planet informed the Tribunal that they had sent hard copies
of all responsive documents in their possession at that time, and that they would adhere to
the continuing obligation under Procedural Order No. 5 to produce any outstanding final
awards or decisions, as specified in that Order, as soon as they become available.

On 13 March 2013, Churchill and Planet filed their Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits,
enclosing 348 exhibits and 69 legal exhibits.

On 8 April 2013, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, enclosing
101 exhibits and 77 legal exhibits.

On 30 April 2013, Churchill and Planet filed their Reply to Indonesia’s Objections to
Jurisdiction, enclosing 12 exhibits and 70 legal exhibits. The Reply was also accompanied
by the Second Expert Report of the Claimants’ expert on Indonesian law,
Dr. Nono A. Makarim.

On 6 May 2013, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Objections to Jurisdiction, enclosing
9 exhibits and 28 legal exhibits.

On 8 May 2013, the Tribunal and the Parties held a pre-hearing telephone conference in
order to discuss outstanding matters related to the organization of the hearing on
jurisdiction. The telephone conference was audio-recorded. On the same day, the Tribunal
issued Procedural Order No. 6 containing the schedule of the hearing.

During the morning session of the hearing on 13 May 2013, the Parties made short
opening statements, followed by the examination of Planet’s expert witness on Indonesian
law, Dr. Nono Makarim. In the afternoon, the Respondent then presented its first round of
oral arguments. During the morning session of the hearing on 14 May 2013, Planet
presented its first round of oral arguments. In the afternoon, each Party, starting with the
Respondent, presented its second round of oral arguments.

The hearing was sound recorded. A verbatim transcript was subsequently distributed to the
Parties.

Post-HEARING PHASE

On 28 May 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 confirming that there would
be no post-hearing briefs, that corrections to the hearing transcript were due by
29 May 2013, that the Tribunal would decide on any disagreement between the Parties in
this respect, and that each Party was to submit its statement of costs by 5 June 2013,
allowing the other Party to comment by 12 June 2013. The Parties submitted their agreed
revisions to the hearing transcript on 29 May 2013.

In the course of its deliberations, the Tribunal identified several matters requiring further
submissions. On 22 July 2013, the Tribunal sent to the Parties a series of questions,
inviting them to respond simultaneously by 12 August 2013, and to comment, again
simultaneously, by 16 August 2013. On the Claimant's request, the Tribunal postponed
these dates and the Parties filed their submissions on 23 and 30 August 2013. Planet (and
Churchill) enclosed 6 exhibits and 26 legal exhibits to its first submission and 3 legal
exhibits to its second submission. Indonesia enclosed 5 exhibits and 3 legal exhibits to its
first submission and 1 exhibit and 18 legal exhibits to its second submission.

Having deliberated, the Tribunal renders the present decision on jurisdiction.°° The
Tribunal will first summarize the positions of the Parties (Section IV), then analyze these
positions (Section V), and finally set out its decision (Section VI).

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

In its submissions, Indonesia raised the following objections to the jurisdiction of this
Tribunal with regard to Planet:

(i) The Respondent has not provided its consent in writing to submit the
disputes encompassed in the Requests for Arbitration to ICSID;

(ii) | Planet's alleged investments do not fall within the scope of investments
protected under the Australia-Indonesia BIT, because (i) Planet violated the
terms of the investment approvals by engaging in activities not
contemplated in the approvals, including using PT ICD as an investment
vehicle; (ii) Planet, in complete disregard of Indonesian laws prohibiting
PMA companies such as PT ICD to own shares or any interest in KP
Holders such as the Ridlatama Companies, entered into beneficial
ownership arrangements in order to circumvent that limitation thereby
violating Article 1320 of the Civil Code and Article 33 of the 2007

Investment Law.*"
On the basis of these arguments, Indonesia invites the Tribunal to:

(i) decline jurisdiction in the present case; and

(ii) order Planet to pay the totality of costs relating to this Arbitration, including

the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal, Respondent's legal

fees and all other amounts incurred by Respondent.”

The Tribunal uses the term “jurisdiction” as referring to “the jurisdiction of the Centre” and “the
competence of the Tribunal” (see Art. 41(2) of the ICSID Convention).

Rejoinder, § 135.

Rejoinder, § 136.

B. THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION
79. Inits submissions, the Claimant put forward the following main arguments:

(i) Indonesia consented to ICSID arbitration under the Australia-Indonesia BIT;

(ii) in any event, the requirement of consent under the Australia-Indonesia BIT
is fulfilled by way of the BKPM Approvals granted to PT ICD;

(iii) the investment has been admitted in accordance with the 1967 Foreign
Capital Investment Law or any law amending or replacing it.

80. On the basis of these contentions, Planet requests the Tribunal to:

1) Reject all jurisdictional objections raised by Indonesia; and

2) Declare that it has jurisdiction under the Australia-Indonesia BIT and the
ICSID Convention.

3) Order that Indonesia pay all fees and costs incurred in connection with the
arbitration proceedings, including the costs of the arbitrators and of ICSID
as well as legal and other expenses incurred by the Claimant on a full
indemnity basis, plus interest accrued thereupon at a rate to be determined
by the Tribunal from the date on which such costs are incurred to the date
of payment; and

4) Award any other relief the Tribunal deems just and appropriate.**

Vv. ANALYSIS

81. The Tribunal will first address certain preliminary matters (A) before it enters into the
analysis of the jurisdictional objections (B and C).

PRELIMINARY MATTERS

1. One or two decisions/awards?

At the common session during which consolidation of the proceedings before the Tribunal
was agreed, the Respondent indicated a preference for a single decision/award, while
Churchill and Planet asked for two separate decisions/awards. The issue was left open
and Procedural Order No. 4, issued after the common session, states that the Tribunal will
resolve it. At the hearing, the Tribunal again requested the Parties’ views.*° The
Respondent reiterated its preference for a single decision/award, and stated that “Planet is
controlled by Churchill Mining and the claims are the same, so the fact that there are two
different bilateral investment treaties is really irrelevant for us. So we would like the tribunal
just to render one award or one decision on jurisdiction’.°° Churchill and Planet, for their
part, maintained their prior position by stating that “the earlier position we articulated was
that we encouraged the efficiencies to be gained by having single hearings in respect of
the two cases and that we sought separate awards, and that remains our position”.°”

The Tribunal is of the view that it must respect the modalities of consolidation agreed by
the Parties. The Parties have agreed to consolidate the two arbitrations for all purposes
including the conduct of the proceedings and the case account, with the exception of the
decisions/awards. Absent consent in this latter respect, the Tribunal considers that it lacks
the power to issue a joint decision or award. Hence, the Tribunal will render two separate
rulings, the present one concerning ICSID Case No. ARB/12/40.

2. The relevance of previous ICSID decisions or awards

In support of their positions, the Parties relied on previous ICSID decisions or awards,
either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present case or in an
effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.

Procedural Order No. 4, § 1.3.4.

Tr. 14052013, 126:3-22.
Tr. 14052013, 155:7-12.
Tr. 14052013, 166:6-10.

25

85.

86.

87.

88.

The Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions.* At the same time, it is
of the opinion that it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international
tribunals. Specifically, it deems that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty
to adopt solutions established in a series of consistent cases. It further deems that, subject
to the specific provisions of a given treaty and of the circumstances of the actual case, it
has a duty to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law, with a view to
meeting the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards
certainty of the rule of law.

3. Legal framework

The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is contingent upon the provisions of the ICSID Convention on
the one hand, and of the Australia-Indonesia BIT,®° on the other hand. In addition, where
an international law instrument refers to jurisdictional requirements governed by the
municipal law of a Contracting State, that municipal law shall also govern the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal to the extent provided by the BIT.

3.1. Jurisdictional requirements under the ICSID Convention
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention reads in relevant part as follows:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State [...] anda
national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute
consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have
given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.

Accordingly, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention provides for four requirements for

jurisdiction. There must be (i) a dispute between a Contracting State and a national of

100

another Contracting State, (ii) of a legal nature, (iii) arising directly from an

investment," and (iv) the Parties must have consented in writing to arbitration.

In its Reply, § 173, the Claimant indicates that “investor-state jurisprudence, which constitutes non-
binding but persuasive authority [constitutes] therefore appropriate ‘supplementary means of
interpretation’ under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention”. The Respondent also indicated that it is
for the Tribunal to make its own assessment of the authorities submitted by the Parties, see
Tr. 13052013, 139:22-140:16.

Mem., § 313; Reply, § 7.

26

89. There is no dispute on the first three requirements and rightly so. Indeed, the Tribunal is
satisfied that these requirements are met. By contrast, there is a dispute about the fourth
requirement, Indonesia arguing in its first jurisdictional objection that it has not consented
to submit the present dispute to ICSID arbitration (B. below).

3.2 Jurisdictional requirements under the BIT
90. Article XI of the BIT reads in relevant part as follows:

1. In the event of a dispute between a Party and an investor of the
other party relating to an investment, the parties to the dispute shall
initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultations and negotiations.

2. In the event that such a dispute cannot be settled through
consultations and negotiations, the investor in question may submit
the dispute, for settlement:

a. in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Party which
has admitted the investment to the competent judicial or
administrative bodies of that Party; or

b. to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment
Disputes (‘the Centre”) for the application of the conciliation or
arbitration procedures provided by the 1965 Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of Other States (“the Convention”).

L-]

4. Where a dispute is referred to the Centre pursuant to sub-
paragraph 2(b):

a. where that action is taken by an investor of one Party, the other
Party shall consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to
the Centre within forty-five days of receiving such a request
from the investor; or

b. _ if the parties to the dispute cannot agree whether conciliation or

arbitration is the more appropriate procedure, the investor
affected shall have the right to choose.

91. It is undisputed that Indonesia is a Contracting Party of the BIT, and that Planet qualifies
as an “investor of the other party”, i.e. of Australia. It is equally undisputed that the dispute
is “relating to an investment’.

27

92.

93.

94.

95.

96.

It is further common ground that Article III(1)(a) of the BIT sets out two additional
requirements for jurisdiction, namely (i) the investment must have been made in the
territory of Indonesia, and (ii) it must have been granted admission under relevant foreign
investment legislation. It does so in the following terms:

1. This Agreement shall apply to:

(a) investments of investors of Australia in the territory of the Republic of

Indonesia which have been granted admission in accordance with the

Law No. 1 of 1967 concerning Foreign Investment or with any law

amending or replacing it.
In this latter respect, the Tribunal notes that the 1967 Foreign Investment Law was
amended by Law No. 11 of 1970, and replaced on 26 April 2007 by Law No. 25 of 2007
concerning Investment (“2007 Investment Law’).'°°
While it is undisputed that Planet made an investment in the territory of Indonesia, the
Parties diverge on the fulfillment of the second requirement contained in Article III(1)(a),
which is the subject of Indonesia’s second jurisdictional objection (C. below).

3.3 Rules for treaty interpretation

The ICSID Convention and the BIT must be interpreted pursuant to the rules of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) which codifies customary international law (see
below 9 147-151).

3.4 Test for jurisdiction

At the jurisdictional stage, the Claimant must establish (i) that the jurisdictional
requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and of the Treaty are met, which
includes proving the facts necessary to meet these requirements, and (ii) that it has a
prima facie cause of action under the Treaty, that is, that the facts it alleges are susceptible
of constituting a breach of the Treaty if they are ultimately proven. The Tribunal finds that
this test strikes a proper balance between a more exacting standard which would call for
examination of the merits at the jurisdictional stage, and a less exacting standard which
would confer excessive weight to the Claimant’s own characterization of its claims.

FIRST OBJECTION: CONSENT

1. The Respondent's Position

Indonesia challenges jurisdiction on the ground that it has not consented to ICSID
jurisdiction under the Australia-Indonesia BIT.’ Bearing in mind the fundamental
requirement of State consent under international law (1.1. below) and the general rules of
treaty interpretation (1.2. below), Indonesia argues in essence that Article XI of the
Australia-Indonesia BIT does not provide consent to ICSID arbitration with respect to
Planet's claims (1.3. below). More specifically, Indonesia contends that the wording “shall
consent in writing [...] within forty-five days” contained in Article XI(4) shows that a
subsequent act is required to achieve consent and that Indonesia legitimately withheld its
consent (1.4. below). Finally, Indonesia submits that the BKPM approvals granted to PT
ICD do not encompass Indonesia’s consent to ICSID arbitration of the claims asserted by
Planet (1.5. below), and that, in any event, they do not extend to Planet (1.6. below).

1.1. State consent is a fundamental requirement under international law

Indonesia recalls that the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals is based on the
consent of States, and that various ICSID tribunals have described consent as the
cornerstone of the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals.'°° State consent cannot be presumed; it

must be established by definitive evidence. '® In the framework of ICSID, “consent must be

supplied by a written manifestation of consent”. '°”

It should be noted that in its submissions on Article XI of the Australia-Indonesia BIT Indonesia
essentially relies on its analysis developed on Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT, as well as on the
legal authorities provided in the context of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 between Churchill Mining Plc
and Indonesia. See Rejoinder, 9 38-39 (‘“Therefore, the analysis that Respondent developed
regarding Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT [in the context of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14] is
applicable here with equal, if not greater, force because a treaty provision which requires that
consent be given within a specific timeframe at the request of the investor after the emergence of
the dispute cannot reasonably be construed as supplying that very consent. The legal authorities
that Respondent provided regarding the proper interpretation of Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT
are also all relevant here”). Accordingly, some of the references below are taken from Indonesia's
submissions on the “shall assent” clause filed in the context of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14.

RMOdJ, 99 142-143; Tr. 13052013, 131:21-133:4.

RMOJ, 4 145; Tr. 13052013, 132:19-25. The Respondent relies in particular on the Daimler
decision, where it was held that “it is not possible to presume that consent has been given by a
state [...] Non-consent is the default rule; consent is the exception. Establishing consent therefore
requires affirmative evidence”. Exh. RLA-020, § 175.

1.2 The rules on treaty interpretation as reflected in the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties

Indonesia argues that Article XI must be interpreted in accordance with Articles 31-33 of
the VCLT. In this respect, Indonesia puts emphasis on the ordinary meaning of the
provision; a holistic approach, considering the object and purpose of the BIT, does not
justify disregarding the words themselves. ‘°° Indonesia also claims that “interpretation of a
treaty cannot amount to its revision”. "°° Finally, for Indonesia, the Tribunal should apply the
principle of contemporaneity and determine the original will of the Contracting States,
instead of adopting an evolutionary interpretation of the dispute settlement clause
contained in the BIT.

1.3. Article XI of the BIT does not provide consent

Indonesia submits that the “shall consent in writing” clause in Article XI does not provide
“automatic” consent to ICSID arbitration. It finds that Planet’s position regarding the
interpretation of Article XI of the Treaty has been “characterized by a series of volte-faces
and vacillations”.""° In its Request for Arbitration, Planet sought to ground the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction exclusively on the alleged consent in Article XI of the Treaty.''' Then, in its
Memorial, Planet conceded that Article XI requires an additional act of consent and argued
that this additional consent was to be found in the BKPM approvals. '"? And yet again in its
Reply and at the hearing, Planet contended that the Australia-Indonesia BIT enshrines
Indonesia’s advance consent. '"*

. According to the Respondent, for consent to be established, the State must perform a

further act following the submission of a request by a claimant. In support of this position,
Indonesia advances essentially six arguments: first, the ordinary meaning of the terms

RMOdJ, § 149 (“Under Article 31, a treaty is to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of the treaty’s object and
purpose. The holistic approach of considering the object and purpose of a treaty in the interpretation
of its terms does not justify disregard of the words themselves’).

dispute to the Centre within forty-five days’ appears to require an additional act of consent on the
part of Indonesia”).

contained in Article XI(4) is clear — the terms require an additional act of consent to be
submitted within forty-five days of the filing of the request for arbitration; second, the
structure of the Australia-Indonesia BIT, in particular the link between Articles XI and III(1),
confirms the ordinary meaning of “shall consent in writing”; third, the object and purpose of
a treaty cannot defeat its plain language; fourth, particular attention must be paid to the
principle of contemporaneity; fifth, doctrinal writings support Indonesia’s understanding of
Article Xl; and sixth, third-party treaties concluded by Australia confirm Indonesia’s
position.

First and foremost, Indonesia argues that the ordinary meaning of the expression “shall
consent in writing [...] within forty-five days” in Article XI(4) of the BIT cannot be
understood as conferring automatic jurisdiction to the Tribunal. This provision expresses a
pactum de contrahendo whereby the Contracting State must and can only give its consent
within 45 days after the filing of a request by a qualifying investor.''* Indonesia contrasts
this clause with the “hereby consents” or similar clauses found in the other BITs.''® The
latter provide ex ante consent, while the former envisages ex post consent to be provided
on an ad hoc basis.''® Therefore, in the absence of a subsequent declaration, the Tribunal
cannot but deny its jurisdiction.'"”

Second, the structure of the dispute settlement provision and the link to other jurisdictional
requirements confirm Indonesia’s position. Article XI(4) establishes a two-step mechanism
whereby the investor first submits a request and the host State thereafter has 45 days to
provide its consent.''® “Obviously, a treaty provision which states that a consent shall be
given within a specific timeframe at the request of the investor cannot reasonably be
interpreted as supplying the very consent’.""® Indonesia accordingly refutes Planet's
submission that Article XI(2) of the Treaty already contains the Contracting States’
advance consent, since Article XI(4) expressly refers back to and thus qualifies Article
XI(2). Indeed, Article XI(4) is “part and parcel” and does not fall outside the “four corners of
the operative dispute settlement arrangements” as argued by the Claimant." Article XI(2)

contains a generic reference to ICSID and Article XI(4) specifies how consent in writing
shall be provided. '*"

Indonesia also rejects Planet’s argumentation on Article XI(5). Article XI(4) and
Article XI(5) both refer back to Article XI(2) and the link between paragraphs 5 and 2 is
“premised on the assumption that such an action can be taken pursuant to the mechanism
laid down in Article X1I(4) because Article XI(4) specified the modus operandi by means of
which a dispute can be submitted to ICSID arbitration”. '

The Respondent further contrasts the language employed in paragraph 4 from the one in
paragraph 3, the latter providing “consent to UNCITRAL arbitration by stating ‘shall be
bound to submit’, but Article XI(4) does not employ that kind of language, and instead
refers to an obligation to consent in the future to the referral of a dispute to ICSID”.'*

For Indonesia, the two-step mechanism contained in Article XI(4) of the Treaty entails that
Indonesia may refuse to consent if other jurisdictional requirements are not fulfilled,‘ in
particular, if the investment has not been granted admission in accordance with
Indonesia’s Foreign Investment Law as required by Article III(1) of the BIT."%° In this
context, Indonesia relies on Desert Line v. Yemen, where the tribunal held that some
States “require that investors wishing to be protected must identify themselves, on the
footing that only specifically approved investments will give rise to benefits under the
relevant treaty”.'?° The tribunal, which expressly referred to the Australia-Indonesia BIT, '”
went on to state that “[t]his is a different approach, but it too has a legitimate policy
rationale, in the sense that the Governments of such States evidently wish to exercise a
qualitative control on the types of investments which are indeed to be promoted and
protected”. '*

Third, Indonesia contends that “an interpretation based upon the object and purpose
cannot go against the plain language of the treaty”.'*° The encouragement and protection
of foreign investments is not the sole purpose of investment treaties and that a “State may
balance the policy of encouraging investment by investors of the other State party to the
BIT with other policies or considerations, one of which may be to preserve the ability to
avoid ICSID arbitration of disputes relating to investments outside the protection of the BIT
in question”. ‘°°

The Respondent further argues that, even if the object and purpose of the BIT were limited
to the promotion and protection of foreign investments, it cannot defeat the clear language
of Article XI(4) of the Treaty.'® In support, Indonesia in particular quotes the Iran-US
Claims Tribunal, which held that “[t]he object and purpose is not to be considered in
isolation from the terms of the treaty; it is intrinsic to its text. It follows that, under Article 31
of the Vienna Convention, a treaty’s object and purpose is to be used only to clarify the
text, not to provide independent sources of meaning that contradict the clear text”.'**

Fourth, Indonesia asserts that the BIT must be interpreted according to the principle of
contemporaneity, which requires interpreting a treaty by reference to the understanding of
its terms at the time when it was concluded. '*

Fifth, Indonesia relies on various doctrinal writings echoing its interpretation of Article XI of
the Treaty. For instance, referring to the Australia-Indonesia BIT, Michael Pryles and
Richard Garnett write that Australia’s BITs “require the host State to consent in writing to
the submission of the dispute to ICSID (usually within 30 or 45 days)” and that “[wJithout
such consent an ICSID arbitral tribunal will not have jurisdiction”. "** In addition, Indonesia

refers to scholarly writings it filed in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 in support of its

promise to consent does not provide the investor with an immediate right to resort to
international arbitration. ‘°°

. Sixth and last, the Respondent finds support for its reading of Article XI in BITs concluded

by Australia with third parties. For its argument that Article XI(4)(a) cannot be dissociated
from Article XI(2), Indonesia relies on Australia’s treaties with the Czech Republic,
Hungary, and Poland, which articulate the abovementioned two-step procedure in a single
paragraph. "®” For instance, Article 11(3)(a) of the Australia-Czech Republic BIT provides

“(3) Either party to a dispute may take the following action irrespective

paragraph (2) of this Article have already been pursued or exhausted:

(a) if both Contracting Parties are at that time party to the 1965
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States
and Nationals of other States (“the Convention”), refer the dispute to
the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(‘the Centre”) for conciliation or arbitration pursuant to Article 28 or 36
of the Convention. Where this action is taken by an investor of one
Contracting Party the other Contracting Party shall consent in writing

to the submission of the dispute to the Centre within thirty days of
receiving such a request from the investor”.

Australia’s BITs with Argentina and Turkey also confirm Indonesia's interpretation as they
expressly incorporate the Contracting States’ advance consent, thus showing that Australia
is aware of the difference between consent and a promise to consent.'®® Finally, the
Australia-Sri Lanka BIT serves to refute Planet’s submission that Article XI(4)(a) of the
Treaty serves no other purpose than “administrative convenience”. That treaty makes it
clear that a subsequent act is required in order to access ICSID, failing which consent is
deemed to exist for non-institutional arbitration as provided in that treaty.'“°

Moreover, Planet's reliance on National Interest Analyses (“NIAs”) prepared since 1996 by

Sri Lanka BIT, which does not mention the requirement for additional consent, although
Planet acknowledged that such treaty did so require. '*

1.4 Indonesia legitimately exercised its right to withhold consent

Article III(1) of the Australia-Indonesia BIT limits protection to investments that have been
granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Investment Law or any successor
legislation. “* Indonesia considers that Planet’s investment does not meet this requirement,
thus justifying its refusal to arbitrate the present dispute.

In any event, the Tribunal could not accept jurisdiction on the ground that Indonesia's
refusal to give consent is illegal, as this would “put the cart before the horse”.'“* Indeed,
the Tribunal must have jurisdiction to be able to rule on the legality of Indonesia’s
omission. Indonesia further asserts that any challenge of its refusal is subject to the State-
to-State dispute resolution mechanism provided in the BIT. In other words, this Tribunal is
the wrong tribunal and the Claimant is the wrong party for that hypothetical dispute.

1.5 The BKPM approvals granted to PT ICD do not contain consent to ICSID
arbitration of Planet's claims

Indonesia submits that Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM approval does not constitute
consent to ICSID arbitration, because (i) the BKPM does not have authority to grant

consent to ICSID arbitration, (ii) the wording of Section IX(4) does not include consent on

146

the part of Indonesia, because the word bersedia means “is prepared/ready”*”’ and not “is

willing” as proposed by the Claimant;'*” (iii) in any event, Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM

approval only extends to PT ICD and not to the Claimani and (iv) the Australia-

At the hearing, the Respondent argued that only the President of the Republic can validly
grant consent to arbitrate under ICSID and that the authority delegated to the BKPM does
not encompass the power to agree to ICSID arbitration.'°° According to Indonesia, the
BKPM's “preparedness” can only mean that, if an investor raises a dispute with the BKPM
or any other agency of the Government, then the BKPM would act as an intermediary to
“assist the investors to go back to the one who holds the authority”, i.e. the President of the
Republic. '®'

Upon a question from the Tribunal at the hearing, the Respondent specified that Article 2
of Law No. 5 of 1968,'%? read in combination with the Indonesian constitution, '* provides
that only the Government, i.e. the President, has the authority to grant ICSID consent. '®*

With regard to the wording of Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval, the Respondent
argues that the word bersedia, even if it means “willingness” or “preparedness”, “fails to
express anything more than a predisposition or openness to pursue settlement in
accordance with the provisions of the ICSID Convention”."® In this context, Indonesia
criticizes Planet for relying merely on Dr. Makarim who adopts a literal translation of the
word bersedia.'®® Dr. Makarim makes no effort to argue that Section IX(4) contains
Indonesia’s consent, as opposed to a mere disposition to pursue a settlement. '*” Nor does
Dr. Makarim provide an opinion on the delegation of authority to the BKPM or on the
extension of Section IX(4) to PT ICD’s shareholders. '®*

Responding to Planet's reliance on Amco, Indonesia asserts that such decision is
inapposite as the dispute settlement provisions are different. The provision in Amco
contained definitive language of approval, while Section IX(4) contains “no explicit

commitment to pursue a settlement through arbitration”. '°°

1.6 Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM approval, in connection with the 2006 BKPM
approval, does not extend to Planet

Indonesia contends that both Churchill and Planet knew that the dispute settlement clause
in Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM did not encompass disputes with PT ICD’s
shareholders. Indeed, none of the Requests for Arbitration referred to the 2005 BKPM
Approval as source of Indonesia’s consent; they only relied on the BITs. In any event, the
wording of Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval shows that it only covers disputes
with PT ICD.'® The word “perusahaan’” is correctly translated as “company”, i.e. PT ICD,
and not as “business” as contended by the Claimant."

2. The Claimant’s Position

In addition to stressing that it is an investor and that all other jurisdictional requirements are
met, © the Claimant essentially submits that Indonesia has consented to ICSID arbitration
under the BIT. First, it outlines the relevant rules on treaty interpretation (2.1. below);
second, it elaborates on its main argument pursuant to which Indonesia consented to
ICSID arbitration by ratifying the BIT (2.2. below); third, it analyzes other BITs concluded
by Australia (2.3. below); and fourth, it challenges various authorities cited by the
Respondent (2.4. below). However, in the event that the Tribunal were to hold that the BIT
requires additional consent, Planet submits that Indonesia has provided such consent by
issuing the BKPM Approvals (2.5. below).

In its written submissions and at the hearing, the Claimant identified Indonesia's
submissions and evidence which, in its view, have no bearing on jurisdiction. "* These
include (i) whether the Claimant's initial interest was in East Kutai or Sendawar; (ii) its
allegedly misleading public announcements; (iii) Indonesia’s allegation that the Claimant
misled its investors; and (iv) Indonesia’s “aspersion” on the character of the Claimant's
witness, Mr. Quinlivan.

2.1 Treaty interpretation rules

According to Planet, there is a hierarchy between the general rule of interpretation under
Article 31 VCLT and recourse to supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32
VCLT.'®* Supplementary means can only come into play if the meaning of the terms is not
clear.'® The interpretation must therefore begin with the language and ensure that the
meaning of the Treaty’s terms is consistent with the rest of the Treaty, including the
preamble and annexes and the specific materials listed under Article 31(2)(a)-(b) and
31(3)(a)-(c) of the VCLT. 1

2.2 Indonesia’s consent is located in Article XI(2)

Planet argues that the language of Article XI(2) is unequivocal and that it “is the beneficiary
of a legally binding right, at its election, to refer disputes to ICSID for arbitration”.'®” The
Claimant relies in particular on cases where the wording “the investor may submit the
dispute” was consistently construed as providing the investor “a legally enforceable right”
to initiate arbitration.'®° Indonesia’s consent to ICSID arbitration is unambiguous and
unqualified.'®° Paragraph 2 of Article XI makes no reference to paragraph 4 and requires
no further action. In Planet's view, “[a]ny other finding would fly in the face of common

sense, ignore the undoubted intention of the drafters of both treaties and lead to palpably

absurd results”,'”° and the Tribunal should retain jurisdiction.

The structure of Article XI confirms this reading. First, paragraph 3 indicates (i) that the
disputing parties may agree to ad hoc arbitration, and (ii) that in the absence of an
agreement within three months, the dispute is to be submitted to an UNCITRAL tribunal.
However, paragraph 3 only applies where one or both of the Contracting States are not
ICSID members. Hence, UNCITRAL arbitration is unavailable if Indonesia and Australia
are parties to the ICSID Convention, with the absurd result that Australia’s investors “would
be able to enforce BIT protection through UNCITRAL, but they would lose recourse to any
enforceable mechanism if Australia became an ICSID contracting state”.'”"

Second, paragraph 5 confirms Planet's interpretation since it cannot have been the
drafters’ intention to preclude diplomatic protection if the investor's access to ICSID
arbitration were not “absolutely assured”.'”* Diplomatic protection by the investor’s home
State is precluded once “an action referred to in paragraph 2 has been taken”, i.e. once a
dispute has been submitted to ICSID. There is no reference to paragraph 4 or to any
additional action required from the host State.

Third, Planet argues that paragraph 4 finds application where a dispute has already been
referred to ICSID pursuant to paragraph 2. Hence, Article XI(4)(a) is not concerned with
obtaining the host State’s consent, since that consent is already provided under Article
XI(2).'7° For Planet “Article XI(4) does not in terms impinge upon an agreement to arbitrate
arising under Article XI(2)”.'* Paragraph 4 “falls outside the four corners of the operative

dispute settlement arrangements” of paragraph 2,'” since it deals with procedural matters

and does not “address the existence of an arbitration agreement per se”.'7°

Fourth, pointing to other treaties concluded around the same time and containing similar
“anachronistic references”,'”’ Planet contends that the drafters of Article XI(4)(a) were

struggling to find ways to evidence “consent in writing” as required by Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention. In its submission, Article X1(4)(a) is thus best understood “as a matter
of administrative convenience and good housekeeping for the benefit of the ICSID
Secretariat”.'”® In any event, the use of the mandatory word “shall” leaves no room for
maneuver to Indonesia, which cannot disregard its duty under that provision. '”°

Fifth, Planet stresses that several other features of paragraph 4 are “curious”. The wording
“where that action is taken by an investor of one party” in subparagraph (a) gives the
impression that such an action could also be taken by the host State, when investment
treaty obligations fall upon the host State and the right to initiate arbitration is normally
bestowed on investors only.'®° Further, Planet notes that paragraph 4 is not formulated in a
cumulative manner. Subparagraph (b) is introduced by the word “or” and therefore covers
an alternative situation. Under subparagraph (b), the investor ultimately chooses between
arbitration and conciliation. Hence, even if the host State fails to comply with its duty under
subparagraph (a), the investor can pursue the proceedings by choosing between
arbitration and conciliation under subparagraph (b).

. Planet claims that its interpretation of Article XI is also supported by the object and

purpose of the BIT, which is to promote investments and stimulate investors’ business
activities.'®"

2.3. A comparison with other BITs concluded by Australia confirms Planet’s
interpretation

According to Planet, the wording “shall consent in writing to the submission of the dispute
to the Centre” appears in thirteen of the twenty-two BITs concluded by Australia since

Treaty between the United States of America and Ukraine concerning the Encouragement and
Reciprocal Protection of Investment, Art. VI(4) (Exh. CLA-79). See also: Tr. 14052013, 54:3-55:3.
Reply, § 150. At the hearing, Planet submitted that subparagraph (a) is ambiguous as to whether
consent in writing is to furnished to the investor or to ICSID (Tr. 14052013, 53:12-14). In its Reply,
Planet was more assertive when it stated that “[t]he consent in writing referred to in Article XI(4)(a)
is addressed ‘to the Centre’ (emphasis added), not to the investor. The obligation created by Article
XI(4)(a) is to furnish the Centre with a copy of the host State’s ‘consent in writing to the submission
of the dispute to the Centre’, not to provide such consent to the investor’ (q 149).

1988. '®* Therefore Article XI of the Treaty constitutes standard Australian practice. '® If the
Tribunal were to accept Indonesia’s self-serving interpretation “it would in practice
undermine the procedural protections contained in the majority of Australian BITs”.'** In
support, Planet relies on the ruling on interim measures in Tethyan Copper v. Pakistan,
where the tribunal held on a prima facie basis that the “shall consent in writing” language of
the Australia-Pakistan BIT “per se constituted binding written consent to ICSID arbitration,
without requirement of any further act of consent on the part of Pakistan”.'®° In any event,
counsel for Pakistan raised numerous jurisdictional objections but did not argue that the

BIT did not provide Pakistan’s binding consent. '®°

. Similarly, Planet argues that Australian treaty drafters employ very different language when

requiring an additional act of consent, as the dispute settlement provision of Australia’s
BITs with India and Sri Lanka.'®’ The first reads as follows:

“if [...] both Parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit the
1» 188

dispute to [ICSID] such a dispute shall be referred to the Centre”.

And the second reads in relevant part:

“(a) where that action is taken by an investor of one Party, the other
Party should consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the
Centre within thirty days of receiving such a request from the investor.
Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld”. ©

As regards Article 12(2) of the Australia-Vietnam BIT, ICSID jurisdiction is predicated on
the ratification of the ICSID Convention by both States, but it does not require an additional
act of consent. According to Planet, Article 12(2) of that treaty covers three possibilities:

“i. both State Parties have ratified the ICSID Convention (Article
12(2)(b));

C-PHB1, § 58 (“The requirement in Article XI(4) of the Australia-Indonesia BIT that the host State

approximately two-thirds of Australian BITs signed between 1988 and 1995, and appears in over

136. The National Interest Analyses (NIAs) prepared by the Australian Government in

137. Where the treaty drafters however wished to require an additional act of consent, this issue

connection with BITs discussed in the Australian parliament confirm that Article XI of the
Treaty contains Indonesia’s advance consent. The NIAs issued in conjunction with the
BITs concluded by Australia with Peru, Pakistan, Lithuania and Egypt contain dispute
settlement provisions that are identical to those of the Australia-Indonesia BIT. None of
these NIAs mention the necessity of an additional act of consent by the host State, but

“It is also possible, given that Australia and Peru are both party to the
1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of Other States as specified in Article 13.2.b,
that a Peruvian investor may refer a dispute relating to an investment
with Australia to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID) (Article 13.2.b). In this case, Australia may be
required to bear all or part of the cost of arbitration, subject to the
discretion of the tribunal”. '*

“Under Article 12.3, the option of referring a dispute between a
contracting Party and an investor of the other contracting Party to the

both Parties to a dispute. As India is not a Party to the ICSID
Convention, this formulation was necessary to provide that the
agreement referred to in ICSID in accordance with the Australian
Model Text would only operate if India were to agree to submit a

dispute to that forum”.'®>

2.4 — Indonesia’s reliance on doctrinal writings is mistaken

Planet challenges Indonesia's reliance on doctrinal writings as being “misleading in its
breadth and mistaken in its content’”.'** Indonesia’s interpretation is not substantiated by
any travaux préparatoires relating to Indonesia’s own treaties. '® Nor do the commentators
cited by Indonesia rely on preparatory materials relating to the Australia-Indonesia BIT. '%°

For the Claimant none of the authors having analyzed Australian BITs have cited any
authority in support of their opinion that Article XI of the Australia-Indonesia BIT only
contains a promise to consent. Michael Pryles and Richard Garnett rely on their own
” while Jason Webb Yackee cites Christoph Schreuer’s analysis of “shall
assent” or similarly worded clauses in support of his interpretation.'®® Like all the other

reasoning, ®

authors relied upon by Indonesia, Schreuer relies on Broches’ analysis, who himself cites
nothing in support of his view. Through a “citation chain” dating back to Broches, '% authors
have reproduced the same mistaken interpretation. That interpretation has become
“conventional wisdom”, but is no evidence of the intent of the drafters.°°

2.5 Indonesia has provided its consent under the BKPM Approvals

Should the Tribunal find that the Australia-Indonesia BIT requires an additional act of
consent, Planet argues that the Respondent has given such consent in the 2005 BKPM
Approval. This consent was transferred to the Claimant upon its acquisition of shares in PT
ICD through the 2006 BKPM Approval, which incorporated the 2005 BKPM Approval.

. The Claimant disputes that the BKPM Approvals only extend to PT ICD and not to its

shareholders. Relying on Noble Energy v. Ecuador, the Claimant disputes that the
Respondent granted its consent only to PT ICD “when the only manner in which that

company could benefit from such consent would be under investment treaties [...] to which

it would resort by virtue of its foreign ownership
Planet further relies on Amco v. Indonesia and Holiday Inns v. Morocco for the proposition
that a host State’s consent contained in domestic instruments, such as contracts
concluded with or licenses granted to local subsidiaries, extends to the foreign investors
insofar as they carry out their obligations under the contract.*°? The Claimant argues that,
together with Churchill, it is the driving force behind PT ICD’s activities and that it funded
these activities allocating resources to the EKCP project. Therefore, it is “reasonable to
interpret the ICSID consent granted by the Respondent as intended to protect its rights as
investor as well, especially since they overlap almost entirely with those of PT ICD”.*°

The Claimant also relies on evidence of Dr. Makarim, who notes that the inclusion of an
ICSID dispute settlement clause in BKPM approvals is not standard practice.?™ In spite of
a divergent practice, reference to ICSID dispute settlement was expressly included here
and granted to a local company that was in foreign hands at 95% from its inception and at
100% since the Claimants’ acquisition. For these reasons, Dr. Makarim is of the view that
the “deliberate insertion of the clause [...] must be interpreted as the Government's
intention to follow the [ICSID] Convention's dictates in settling disputes”.”°°

With regard to the wording of Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval, the Claimant
translates the Indonesian word bersedia as “is willing”.*°° Hence, Section IX(4) expresses
the willingness to follow the ICSID procedures. Planet also refutes the Respondent’s
allegation that the BKPM lacked authority to agree to ICSID arbitration, observing that the
BKPM Approval was copied to the President's office and various other Ministries.” Had
the BKPM overstepped its authority, the President would presumably have taken
appropriate action.

3. Analysis

3.1 Consent to ICSID arbitration in general

Article 25 of the ICSID Convention requires consent of the Parties to be bound to arbitrate
under the ICSID regime. Several arbitral tribunals have taken the position that the
expression of consent to ICSID arbitration must be “clear and unambiguous”,”” or that
consent must be proven through “affirmative evidence”.*"° Except for calling for a writing,
the ICSID Convention contains no particular requirement of clarity or otherwise. Hence, the

Tribunal will assess consent pursuant to the general rules on treaty interpretation.

When interpreting the BIT and seeking to assess the common intention of the Contracting
States, account must be taken of the special nature of investor-State arbitration, namely
that the home State of the investor is not a party to the arbitration. It does not have the
opportunity to present its views on the interpretation of “its” treaty nor to produce evidence
in support, unlike the host State. This asymmetry inherent in investment treaty arbitration
may justify recourse to the Tribunal’s procedural powers under Rules 34 and 37 of the
ICSID Arbitration Rules.

According to Article 31 VCLT, a treaty must be interpreted “in good faith in accordance with
the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light
of its object and purpose”. No special rule applies to the interpretation of a dispute
settlement provision. Hence, such treaty provisions must be construed like any other,
neither restrictively nor broadly. Or in the words of Amco:

“[Llike any other conventions, a convention to arbitrate is not to be
construed restrictively, nor, as a matter of fact, broadly or liberally. It
is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the
common will of the parties; such a method of interpretation is but the
application of the fundamental principle pacta sunt servanda, a
principle common, indeed, to all systems of internal law and to
international law”.?'

. The Parties concur, and rightly so, that the starting point for treaty interpretation is the

text.4 The ordinary meaning of the text must be ascertained in the light of the context and
the treaty’s object and purpose, any subsequent agreement or practice of the Contracting
States related to the interpretation of the treaty, and any other relevant rules of
international law binding the Contracting States.?">

The primacy of the text viewed in its context and bearing in mind the treaty’s object and
purpose implies that recourse to extrinsic evidence is only allowed in limited
circumstances. Pursuant to Article 32, one may resort to supplementary means of
interpretation (i) to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31, or
(ii) to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to Article 31 “leaves the
meaning ambiguous or obscure”, or (iii) “leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or
unreasonable”. In H/CEE, the tribunal noted that supplementary means are not a closed
category.?"®

3.3 Does Article XI of the Australia-Indonesia BIT contain Indonesia’s advance
consent?

Indonesia submits that it has not consented in advance to ICSID arbitration. Article XI of
the Australia-Indonesia BIT is not a standing offer to arbitrate. It merely constitutes a
promise to consent. Indonesia also submits that the BKPM Approvals do not express
consent to ICSID arbitration. The Tribunal will first determine whether the BIT contains a
standing offer of ICSID arbitration and only analyze the second objection if necessary.

Article X! of the Australia-Indonesia BIT reads as follows:

“4. In the event of a dispute between a Party and an
investor of the other Party relating to an investment, the parties to
the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by
consultations and negotiations.

2. In the event that such a dispute cannot be settled
through consultations and negotiations, the investor in question
may submit the dispute for settlement:

a. In accordance with the laws and regulations of the Party which
has admitted the investment to the competent judicial or
administrative bodies of that Party; or

b. To the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment
Disputes (‘the Centre”) for the application of the conciliation or
arbitration procedures provided by the 1965 Convention on
the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of Other States (“the Convention’).

3. If both Parties are not at the same time the dispute
arises party to the Convention, the dispute may be submitted to

HICEE BV v. Slovak Republic, Partial Award, 23 May 2011, § 117.

154. According to Indonesia, Article XI of the Treaty contemplates a two-step process in which

such procedures for settlement as may be agreed between the
parties to the dispute. If no such procedures have been agreed
within a three month period from written notification of the claim,
the parties to the dispute shall be bound to submit it to arbitration
under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law as then in force. The arbitral tribunal
shall have the power to award interest. The parties to the dispute
may agree in writing to modify those Rules.

4. Where a dispute is referred to the Centre pursuant to
sub-paragraph 2(b):

»

Where that action is taken by an investor of one Party, the
other Party shall consent in writing to the submission of the
dispute to the Centre within forty-five days of receiving such a
request from the investor; or

om

If the parties to the dispute cannot agree whether conciliation
or arbitration is the more appropriate procedure, the investor
affected shall have the right to choose.

5. Once an action referred to in paragraph 2 has been
taken, neither Party shall pursue the dispute through diplomatic
channels unless:

a. the relevant judicial or administrative body, the arbitral
authority or other body, as the case may be, has decided that
it has no jurisdiction in relation to the dispute in question; or

b. the other Party has failed to abide by or comply with any
judgment, award, order or other determination made by the
body in question.

6. In any proceeding involving a dispute relating to an
investment, a Party shall not assert, as a defence, counter-claim,
right of set-off or otherwise, that the investor concerned has
received or will receive, pursuant to an insurance or guarantee
contract, indemnification or other compensation for all or part of
any alleged loss”.

the foreign investor first submits a request for arbitration and Indonesia then gives its
consent.*!” The natural and ordinary meaning of “shall consent” contained in Article
X\(4)(a) implies a future action, a separate, subsequent act of consent each time an
investor seeks to engage in ICSID arbitration. Article XI(4) only encompasses a promise to
consent or pactum de contrahendo.

Indonesia acknowledges that in principle it is required to grant its consent.*"® It submits,
however, that it is entitled to review on a case-by-case basis whether the jurisdictional
requirements set in the Treaty are fulfilled. In particular, it argues that it is required to give
its consent only if it is established (after the filing of the request for arbitration) that the
investment was granted admission as required under Article IIl(1) of the BIT. Since Planet
failed to conform to the requirements of Article III(1), Indonesia is entitled to withhold its
consent. In any event, even if the Tribunal were to find that the Article III(1) objection is ill-
founded, it would lack jurisdiction, because Indonesia has not given its consent.?"° For
Indonesia, the inter-State arbitration provided in Article XII of the Treaty is designed to

address whether a host State is bound to grant its consent or not.””°

For its part, Planet argues that Article XI(2) fulfills the requirement of consent in writing by
the host State under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. No further action is required from
the host State after the request for arbitration. Article XI(4) falls outside the four corners of
the arbitration clause found in Article XI(2) and (3). In any event, Article XI(4)(a) imposes
an obligation on Indonesia since the ordinary meaning of the word “shall” denotes a legally
binding obligation.”"' It was thus the intent of the treaty drafters to provide investors with
the certainty of access to ICSID arbitration where both BIT States are ICSID members.

The Parties’ disagreement hinges on the interpretation and articulation of paragraphs 2
and 4 of Article XI of the BIT. In a nutshell, the question is whether paragraph 4 qualifies
paragraph 2. It is a difficult question that the Tribunal will seek to resolve by relying first on
the ordinary meaning of the words before turning to the context and the object and purpose
of the Treaty.

Before turning to the ordinary meaning of the words, the Tribunal stresses that it is not
unusual for States in bilateral investment treaties to qualify the host State’s consent to
international arbitration. For instance, some BITs require the investor to exhaust local
remedies, or, to the contrary, to waive the right to initiate other proceedings. Others make
access to international arbitration contingent upon the lapsing of negotiation or cooling-off
periods or upon an attempt to resolve the dispute in court during a certain time.
Accordingly, the Tribunal is not minded to accept Planet’s argument as such that Article

XI(4) falls outside the operative dispute settlement arrangements contained in the two
previous paragraphs, all the more so that Article XI(4) expressly refers to Article XI(2)(b).

The ordinary meaning of the words used in paragraph 2 appears clear. In the absence of
an amicable solution, “the investor in question may submit the dispute for settlement to [the
local courts or] to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes [...]”.
The word “may” seems to indicate that the investor is entitled to institute ICSID
proceedings if it so chooses. The right of initiative rests with the foreign investor and there
is no limitation placed on this right in this paragraph.

The difficulty in this case arises from the context of paragraph 2 and specifically from
paragraph 4. Under that paragraph, if a dispute is referred to the Centre under paragraph
2(b), the host State “shall consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre
within forty-five days of receiving such a request from the investor”.

. The words employed in paragraph 4(a) are also clear. If the host State “shall consent in

writing within 45 days” after the investor’s request, it follows that consent cannot be located
in the Treaty itself and that a separate act is needed. The words used in paragraph 4(a)
call for a number of comments.

First, “shall consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre within forty-five
days” implies a time sequence. The phrase lends support to the view that the investor must
first file a request and only thereafter will the host State “consent” within 45 days. The
Tribunal will revert below to the question whether under the Treaty the host State can only
provide its consent after the filing of a request for arbitration or whether such consent can
also be provided in a separate act in advance of the request (see below {J 200-202).

As to the word “shall”, it can either imply an obligation (suggesting that the Respondent's
submission to ICSID is mandatory) or refer to a future action (suggesting the contrary). Be
this as it may, even if “shall” expresses an obligation of the State to give its consent, the
sanction for a failure to do so would not be to supply the missing consent or to deem that
constructive consent exists. Hence, whatever the meaning of “shall”, it does not advance
the analysis.

Second, Article XI(4)(a) provides that the host State shall “consent in writing”. On the one
hand, one can place the emphasis on “consent”, which favors the Respondent's thesis.

51

a

Consent is a term of foundational importance in the area of international dispute
settlement. In the ICSID framework, disputing parties are required to “consent in writing” to
ICSID arbitration. On the other hand, one can focus on the words “in writing”, which would
support the Claimant’s view to a certain extent. One possibility may be that the drafters of
the Australia-Indonesia BIT were grappling with ways to prove the Contracting Parties’
consent to ICSID arbitration. Indeed, Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, just as Rule
2(2) of the Institution Rules, require consent to be expressed in writing. The treaty drafters
may have sought to devise ways to secure such consent in writing, not being certain that
consent in the BIT met the writing requirement. The Claimant insists that this was a
“feature of the time at which the BIT was drafted”, and points to other BITs concluded by
other States which expressly state that the expression of consent contained in these
treaties fulfills the requirement of consent in writing under the ICSID or other
frameworks.” The Tribunal finds reliance on BITs concluded by other States inapposite
here since they all use language which is lacking in Article XI(4) of the Treaty.

Third, “[w]here a dispute is referred to the Centre” and “that action is taken by an investor”,
Article XI(4)(a) sets a time limit for the host State to give its consent “within forty-five days
of receiving such request from the investor”. In other words, the 45 day time period runs
from the initiation of the arbitration procedure. Article XI(4)(a) is specific in providing the
time limit, the date when it starts, and the action expected from the host State within this
time.

. The mechanism contemplated in Article XI(4) poses a difficulty in the ICSID framework.

Indeed, in the ICSID regime, consent must exist on the day of the filing of the request for
arbitration.” This derives from Institution Rule 2(1)(c) which provides that the request for
arbitration must indicate the date of consent,”** and from Institution Rule 2(2) which
requires consent to be documented. Further, Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention directs
the Secretary-General to refuse to register a request for arbitration when consent is
manifestly lacking. To achieve consent on the day of filing, the investor would have to seek
consent before it files its request. Although this solution is conceivable, it does not reflect

Reply, 150, n. 178-179.

Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention, § 24 (“Consent of the parties must exist when
the Centre is seized (Art. 28(3) and 36(3)) but the Convention does not otherwise specify the time at
which consent should be given”).

Rule 2(3) defines the “date of consent” as “the date on which the parties to the dispute consented in
writing to submit it to the Centre; if both parties did not act on the same day, it means the date on
which the second party acted”.

what Article XI(4) says. This difficulty could be seen as an indication that Article XI(4) is “a
matter of administrative convenience and good housekeeping for the benefit of the ICSID
Secretariat” to use the Claimant's words.” However, the Claimant has provided no
authority or evidence supporting this view. Moreover, the characterization as a mere
formality would have to be read into the provision, which does not use words suggesting a
formality, quite to the contrary. Further, the very existence of a time limit for the
performance of an act would rather weigh against a matter of convenience and in favor of
a requirement conditioning the Centre’s action.

In sum, the ordinary meaning of paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article XI(4) is clear for each
provision taken separately. It is their interaction which creates some uncertainty. However,
lacking any further indication on the common intention of the Contracting States beyond
the text of the Treaty, the Tribunal is inclined to conclude at this stage that Article XI does
not express Indonesia’s advance consent to ICSID proceedings. It would be doing violence
to the clear terms of Article XI(4)(a) to reduce this clause to a mere administrative formality
for ICSID.

. Turning now to the context of Article XI(2) and (4), the Tribunal does not believe that the

use of the word “or” separating Article XI(4)(a) from Article XI(4)(b) is significant. Planet
argues that the disjunctive “or” shows that if Indonesia fails to provide its consent in writing
within the allocated time, then under sub-paragraph (b) the investor has the right to choose
between conciliation and arbitration. A review of Australian BITs containing similar dispute
settlement clauses shows that Australia always used the term “and” between these two
provisions and that the BIT with Indonesia is the only one where the word “or” appears.
Hence, the Tribunal believes that the inclusion of “or” is the result of an infelicitous drafting
rather than a deliberate choice entailing specific consequences. In any event, Planet’s
argument fails since sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) deal with entirely distinct matters.

At the hearing, the Claimant further argued that it would be absurd to allow the investor
access to UNCITRAL under Article XI(3) as long as one or both Contracting States are not
ICSID members, but to deny the investor access both to UNCITRAL and to ICSID when
the Contracting States are ICSID members. Article XI(3) provides that an investor is
entitled to refer the dispute to UNCITRAL proceedings (unless another dispute settlement
mechanism is agreed) if one or both Contracting States are not ICSID members at the time

when the dispute arises. Since both Australia and Indonesia were ICSID members at the
time of the conclusion of the BIT, Article XI(3) could only come into play if one of them
were to denounce the ICSID Convention. It is also noteworthy that a failure to abide by the
requirements of Article XI(4)(a) does not open the door to UNCITRAL arbitration as a
default mechanism. Thus, if one follows Indonesia's interpretation, Planet could well be
barred from ICSID arbitration (because Indonesia does not consent under Article X1(4)(a))
and from UNCITRAL arbitration (because both Contracting States are ICSID members).
This is undoubtedly a surprising and unsatisfactory result. Yet, it is the result that derives
from the text of the Treaty and the Tribunal cannot change the text, especially not in the
absence of travaux that would shed a different light on the words. As was stated in
Renta 4, the Tribunal’s task is to discover, not to invent, meaning.””°

In the same vein, Article XI(5) does not support the Claimant's interpretation. This
provision postulates that the home State is precluded from exercising diplomatic protection
“[o]nce an action referred to in paragraph 2 has been taken”, i.e. once a dispute has been
referred to ICSID. It is consistent with Article 27 of the ICSID Convention in precluding
diplomatic protection as long as the Centre is seized of a dispute, and therefore sheds no
light on the interaction between Article XI(2) and (4). The Tribunal sees no tension
between Article XI(4) and (5). The home State cannot exercise diplomatic protection from
the time the request is filed with ICSID and the host State must give its consent at the
latest 45 days thereafter. If the host State fails to give its consent by that time, the home
State's prerogative to use diplomatic means revives once the Secretary-General of the
Centre refuses to register the request under Article 36(3) of the Convention or the Tribunal
decides that it has no jurisdiction under Article 41 of the Convention.

. Finally, the Claimant opposes Indonesia's argument that any failure to abide by the

requirements of Article XI(4)(a) must be resolved before an inter-State tribunal, because
that tribunal could not supply the missing consent. It is correct that an inter-State tribunal
would not be in a position to procure Indonesia’s missing consent. It could only order
specific performance. It would be left to Indonesia to abide by such an order with the result
that the investor might still be left without recourse to ICSID arbitration. Consequently, the
debate whether Indonesia has discretion to grant consent especially by reference to the
admission requirement of the Treaty, as the Respondent argues, or whether it lacks any

latitude in this respect, as the Claimant submits, does not advance matters much. Its
outcome may determine the outcome of an inter-State arbitration. It says nothing about the
jurisdiction of an investor-State tribunal. For that tribunal's jurisdiction to exist consent is
needed; an obligation to consent is insufficient.

After the context, the Tribunal must address the object and purpose of the Treaty. In its
view, the object and purpose are neutral for present purposes. The preamble of the
Australia-Indonesia BIT states that Australia and Indonesia strive “to create favourable
conditions for investments by investors of one Party in the territory of the other Party”.2?”
The preamble further provides that both States recognize “that promoting the flow of
capital for economic activity and development is important for the expansion of their
economic relations and cooperation, the stimulation of their investors’ business initiative
and the fostering of prosperity in both countries”.””° In other words, the preamble refers to
both the private interests of the investor as well as the public interests of the State. It is
thus of little assistance in the present context.

In sum, the interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the terms employed in paragraphs (2)
and (4) in light of this context leads to the conclusion that Article XI does not contain
Indonesia’s advance consent to ICSID proceedings. This is confirmed by the
supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention upon
which the Parties relied, i.e. doctrinal writings and treaty practice.

Indonesia pointed to various commentators defining categories of expressions of consent
to international arbitration and making a general distinction between advance consent and
a promise to consent.”* Indonesia also quoted various authors adopting the position that

the dispute settlement clause in the Australia-Indonesia BIT contains a promise to consent,
and that a failure to fulfill this promise can only be resolved through inter-State dispute

settlement.”

Doctrinal writings may indeed provide guidance as to the state of the law (Article 38(1)(d)
of the ICJ Statute) and it is self-evident that an opinion grounded on thorough research and
rigorous reasoning is more likely to influence the interpretative process than an opinion
that is not.

Aron Broches appears to be the reference point for most authors relied upon by Indonesia.
He sought to distinguish different types of consent, in particular consents given in advance
and promises to consent. In doing so, Broches relied on the text of the dispute settlement
provisions of several Dutch and English BITs, without referring to travaux préparatoires or
other documents revealing the intention of the drafters.**' The same can essentially be
said of the other authors whom Indonesia invokes and who ultimately all refer back to
Broches.

The authors commenting more particularly on Australian BITs, and on the Australia-
Indonesia BIT — again without providing evidence of the States’ intention — do provide
support for Indonesia's interpretation. Michael Pryles and Richard Garnett state that:

“[a] further feature of Australia’s BITs is that they require the host
State to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to ICSID
(usually within 30 or 45 days). Without such consent an ICSID arbitral
tribunal will not have jurisdiction”.*°

Jason Webb Yackee holds the same opinion:

Disputes, 43 Texas International Law Journal (2008), pp. 531-532 (Exh. RLA-046).

See the references supra note 134.

With regard to the Netherlands BITs, and in addition to the 1968 Netherlands-Indonesia BIT,
Broches refers to the 1971 Netherlands-Morocco BIT, the 1971 Netherlands-Ivory Coast BIT, the
1972 Netherlands-Singapore BIT, the 1974 Netherlands-Korea BIT, and the 1976 Netherlands-
Egypt BIT. With regard to the United Kingdom BITs, Broches refers to the 1976 UK-Indonesia BIT
and the 1980 UK-Philippines BIT. Finally, Broches mentions the 1977 Japan-Egypt BIT. See Aron
Broches, ‘Bilateral Investment Protection Treaties and Arbitration of Investment Disputes’, in:

“Australia’s BITs are very subtle in this regard. They generally contain
a comprehensive, effective pre-consent to ad hoc arbitration, but only
if Australia and its treaty partner have not joined the ICSID
Convention. Where they both have done so, the ad hoc pre-consent
becomes invalid, leaving the investor with the sole option of seeking
ICSID arbitration. But as to ICSID arbitration, each state party to the
Australian treaties promises only that it “shall consent in writing to the
submission of the dispute to the Centre within forty-five days of
receiving such a request from the investor” — with the words “shall
consent” indicating that the consent has not yet been given, but is
only promised”.

179. In a second writing, the same author adds the following:

“[Whhen a state has promised to consent to arbitration in a treaty, a
refusal to actually consent when the investor so demands is indeed a
breach of the treaty under international law. But in the face of such a
refusal, no matter how illegal, an international arbitral tribunal will not
exercise jurisdiction over the dispute, because arbitral jurisdiction
always and necessarily depends on the actual consent of the parties.
This much is quite clear. Less clear is whether the reputational costs
of breaching a promise to arbitrate will typically be so great that a
promise to consent is for all practical | purposes of as much value to
the investor as an actual pre-consent”.

180. Indonesia also relied on an UNCTAD study which, on the basis of its analysis of the “shall

18

consent in writing [...] within thirty days” clause contained in the Australia-Lithuania BIT,
came to the conclusion that the treaty did not contain an expression of consent and that a
refusal to grant consent would “enable the other contracting party to pursue its right under

the State-State dispute settlement mechanism’.

. While the Tribunal has reached its decision irrespective of these writings, which merely rely

on the authors’ reasoning without reference to extrinsic materials, it notes that all the
authorities support the conclusion it adopted on the basis of the text and context. It also
notes that the Claimant failed to submit any authority leading to another conclusion.

interpretation that Article XI(4)(a) is a mere administrative formality, it simply answered that it found

The Parties have also relied in varying degrees on the treaty practice of Indonesia and
Australia. Treaties on the same subject matter concluded respectively by Australia and
Indonesia with third States can legitimately be considered as part of the supplementary
means of interpretation. For instance, in Oil Platforms, the ICJ had recourse to treaties on
the same subject-matter concluded by one disputing party with third States.*°” This
approach also found resonance in investment treaty arbitration, for example in AAPL?" or
in Plama.**°

Prior to the hearing, the Parties had filed a selection of BITs of either Australia or Indonesia
and third parties. To gain a complete view of potential treaty patterns for its decision, the
Tribunal drew up a tentative table containing the dispute settlement clauses entered into by
Australia and Indonesia with third parties. It circulated that table for the Parties’ comments
in two rounds of post-hearing submissions.

In analyzing these treaties, the Tribunal does not mean to make any finding on the
existence of consent to arbitration in the third party treaties. It limits itself to a prima facie
analysis of such treaties and expresses an opinion on the Australia-Indonesia BIT only.

. The information on record shows that Indonesia signed 64 BITs, 49 of which are in

force.“ The tables provided by the Parties in response to the Tribunal’s listings show 25
different formulations indicating Indonesia’s advance consent to international arbitration.**"

Indonesia, out of which 50 are publicly available. In addition, Churchill referred to the Agreement
Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area. Cf. C-PHB1, Annex 1. Indonesia
provided the Tribunal, together with its first post-hearing brief, with a list of 64 BITs, including the
text of all investor-State dispute settlement clauses. (Exh. R-111).

The various formulations are as follows: “hereby consents to submit” (Indonesia- Turkmenistan BIT,

The tables also show that in at least 60 out of 64 BITs, Indonesia has given advance
consent.” These 60 BITs do not include the Australia-Indonesia BIT in dispute in the
present proceeding, nor the BIT Indonesia concluded with the United Kingdom which
contains the wording “shall assent to any request”, a provision relevant for Churchill in
ICSID arbitration ARB/12/14. They do not include the Indonesia-France BIT either, which
mandates the inclusion of consent in the investment approval documentation.*° The only
BIT entered into by Indonesia and still in force, which unequivocally lacks a standing offer
to arbitrate, is the Indonesia-Switzerland BIT containing no investor-State dispute
settlement provision at all.

The tables finally show that since the early 1990s Indonesia has followed a policy of
securing access to international arbitration for investors. The only instance since 1990
where it has not done so is the Australia-Indonesia BIT.

A look at Australia’s treaty practice shows that the wording of the dispute settlement clause
in that latter treaty must have been proposed by the Australian negotiators. Since 1988,
Australia signed 23 BITs, all of which are presently in force. They all contain investor-State
dispute settlement clauses providing (at least partially) for international arbitration.
Australia has a clear preference for ICSID, since only the Australia-Hong Kong BIT does
not mention ICSID, providing instead for UNCITRAL arbitration.*“* The Australia-China BIT
provides direct access to international arbitration only for several specific claims,*“° while
the Australia-Poland and Australia-Hungary BITs make the exhaustion of local remedies a
prerequisite for international arbitration.“° Three BITs contain an unequivocal expression
of consent to ICSID proceedings,”” and another allows the investor to choose between
various mechanisms, including ICSID and the Additional Facility mechanism in case one
Contracting State is not an ICSID member.”

. Between 1990 and 2002, Australia concluded 12 BITs containing a dispute settlement

clause similar to the one of the Treaty with Indonesia, suggesting that this wording
corresponds to one of the model clauses employed by the Australian BIT negotiators.
These BITs all follow the same basic model providing the investor with a choice between
domestic litigation in the host State and ICSID proceedings, to the exclusion of other
international remedies as long as both Contracting States are ICSID members. Most of

Australia-China BIT, Art. XII(2)(b). Under this provision, a qualifying investor can only directly seek
redress in front of an arbitral tribunal constituted in accordance with Annex A of the treaty if the
dispute relates to the amount of compensation in cases of expropriation. For all other claims, the
disputing parties need to agree on the dispute settlement mechanism. Interestingly, Art. XII(4)
indicates that once both Contracting States become ICSID members, a qualifying investor may refer
any dispute to ICSID.

Australia-Poland BIT, Art. 13(4) and Australia-Hungary BIT, Art. 12(4). This requirement does not
apply to expropriation claims under Article 7 of these treaties, see respectively Australia-Poland BIT,
Art. 13(3) and Australia-Hungary BIT, Art. 12(3).

Australia-Argentina BIT, Art. 13(4) (“Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of
any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice made by

caso, cada Parte Contractante por este intermedio otorga su consentimiento previo para someter la
diferencia al CIADI”); Australia-Turkey BIT, Art. 13(5)(a) (“Where a dispute is referred to the Centre
by an investor pursuant to paragraph 2(a) of this Article: (a) the other Party shall, for the purposes of

deemed to have given its consent to the submission of the dispute to the Centre”).

these BITs also indicate that the requested host State “shall consent in writing” within 30°

or 45 days.”

A chronological perusal of these treaties provides some clarity. The first BIT that employs
similar language is the Australia-Papua New Guinea BIT concluded in 1990. Interestingly,
this BIT contains no reference to a time limit, nor does it specify that the host State’s
consent must be in writing.°' The “shall consent in writing” language with a time limit was
first employed in the following two treaties with Poland and Hungary. In these two BITs, as
well as in the treaties with the Czech Republic,” the time limit was included in the same
paragraph as the one providing for ICSID proceedings. All BITs concluded subsequently
by Australia and falling within this category provide for the obligation to provide “consent in
writing” in a separate paragraph. The fourth BIT falling in this category is the Australia-
Indonesia BIT under scrutiny. The following seven BITs concluded until 2002 contain
language that is identical to that of the Australia-Indonesia BIT (with some minor variations
as to the choice of the default procedures*® or the time limit).?°* Finally, the Australia-
Uruguay BIT, which entered into force on 12 December 2012, is the last treaty containing
the wording “shall consent in writing” within a specified time limit. However, this treaty
adopts another structure giving an investor access to the alternative arbitration mechanism
even where both Contracting States are ICSID members.*°°

. The last two remaining BITs have particularly caught the attention of the Tribunal. Article

12 of the Australia-Vietnam BIT contains a dispute settlement clause which is similar in
several respects to the one of the Australia-Indonesia BIT, but differs in other important
respects. The relevant provisions of Article 12 read as follows:

Australia-Romania BIT, Art. 9(3)(a); Australia-Czech Republic BIT, Art. 11(3)(a); Australia-Laos BIT,

Art. 12(3)(a); Australia-Pakistan BIT, Art. 13(3)(a); Australia-Peru BIT, Art. 13(3)(a); Australia-
Lithuania BIT, Art. 13(3)(a); Australia-Egypt BIT, Art. 13(3)(a); Australia-Uruguay BIT, Art. 13(3)(a).
Australia-Philippines BIT, Art. 12(3)(a).

Australia-Papua New Guinea BIT, Art. 14(3)(a) (“Where a dispute is referred to the International
Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes pursuant to sub-paragraph (2)(b) of this Article: (a)
each Contracting Party shall consent to the submission of that dispute to the Centre“).
Australia-Czech Republic BIT, Art. 11(3)(a).

The Australia-Romania, Australia-Laos, Australia-Philippines, Australia-Pakistan, Australia-Peru,
and Australia-Lithuania BITs provide for an arbitral mechanism specified in the relevant treaty or an
annex thereto. Only the Australia-Indonesia BIT provides for UNCITRAL arbitration as the default
procedure, while the Australia-Egypt BIT allows a qualifying investor to choose as the default
procedure between referring the dispute to the arbitral mechanism specified in Annex B of the treaty
or to the Cairo Regional Centre for International Commercial Arbitration.

“(2) If the dispute in question cannot be resolved through
consultations and negotiations, either party to the dispute may:

(a) in accordance with the law of the Contracting Party which has
admitted the investment, initiate proceedings before that Contracting
Party’s competent judicial or administrative bodies;

(b) if both Contracting Parties are at that time party to the 1965
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States
and Nationals of Other States (the Convention”), refer the dispute to
the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(‘the Centre”) for conciliation or arbitration pursuant to Articles 28 or
36 of the Convention;

(c) if both Contracting Parties are not at that time party to the
Convention, or one party to the dispute has not consented to referring
the dispute to the Centre, refer the dispute to an Arbitral Tribunal
constituted in accordance with Annex B of this Agreement, or by
agreement, to any other arbitral authority.

(3) Once an action referred to in paragraph (2) of this Article has been
taken, neither Contracting Party shall pursue the dispute through
diplomatic channels unless:

(a) the relevant judicial or administrative body, the Secretary-General
of the Centre, the arbitral authority or tribunal or the conciliation
commission, as the case may be, has decided that it has no
jurisdiction in relation to the dispute in question; or

(b) the other Contracting Party has failed to abide by or comply with

any judgment, award, order or other determination made by the body
in question”.*°°

The words “or one party to the dispute has not consented to referring the dispute to the
Centre” in Article 12(2)(c) show that Australia contemplates refusing to grant consent.
Planet's argument that these words only refer to the foreign investor refusing to give its
consent is contradicted by the clear text. Interestingly, this treaty was concluded in 1991
shortly before the Australia-Indonesia BIT, which demonstrates that at that time Australia
had a clear understanding of the difference between advance consent and a promise to
consent.

12 November 2002 and entered into force on 14 March 2007:

Indonesia called the attention of the Tribunal to the fact that Australia announced in 2011 that it
would no longer conclude investor-State arbitration provisions in its future investment treaties;

withheld. In other words, the treaty expressly envisages that the host State may refuse its
consent.

These last two treaties show that Australia deliberately entertains the distinction between
advance consent and promise to consent. The foregoing review also demonstrates that
Australia concluded BITs with unequivocal expressions of advance consent and thus
knows how to express such an intent when it wishes to do so. Hence, the Tribunal is of the
opinion that a review of Australia’s treaty practice supports the conclusion it reached
earlier, i.e. that the Australia-Indonesia BIT contains a promise to consent.

Furthermore, the Tribunal notes that the recent decision on provisional measures in
Tethyan Copper v. Pakistan is of no assistance here.*** That arbitration is brought under
Article 13(3)(a) of the Australia-Pakistan BIT, which provides that the host State “shall
consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre within thirty days”. The
tribunal found that it had prima facie jurisdiction since both Parties consented to the
jurisdiction of ICSID in accordance with Article 25(1).7° In addition to being a prima facie
determination, it appears that Pakistan did not object to jurisdiction for purposes of the
provisional measures on the grounds of lack of consent,”*" and it is not known whether it

provided its consent within the 45 days or whether another expression of consent applies.

Finally, Planet’s reliance on various National Interest Analyses (NIAs) prepared since 1996
by the Australian Government in conjunction with proposed new bilateral investment
treaties is to no avail in this regard. Indeed, the Tribunal is of the opinion that they are of
little help in the present context. First, they all post-date the entry into force of the
Australia-Indonesia BIT. Second, the NIAs do not purport to opine on the existence of
consent or the modalities of providing consent under the relevant BITs, but merely indicate
in a section on costs that the Australian Government may be at risk of assuming costs
related to an ICSID arbitration.” Accordingly, the Tribunal did not rely on these NIAs.

198. In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal holds that Article XI of the Australia-Indonesia BIT

200.

20

contains no standing offer to arbitrate Planet's claims before ICSID. Planet is therefore
only entitled to resort to ICSID arbitration if Indonesia’s consent was given through a
further act. This leads the Tribunal to review whether the BKPM approvals can be
construed as containing Indonesia’s separate consent to ICSID arbitration.

3.4 Do the BKPM Approvals contain Indonesia's consent?

. The Claimant argued that if the Tribunal were to find that the BIT contains no standing

consent to ICSID proceedings, such consent in writing has been provided by Indonesia in
the BKPM Approvals of 2005 and 2006. Indonesia essentially objected that (i) the BIT only
contemplates the possibility to grant consent after the filing of a request of arbitration, (ii)
that the BKPM lacks authority to grant consent to ICSID arbitration, (iii) that the word
bersedia in Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval merely denotes a willingness to
consider ICSID procedures, not consent, and (iv) that Section IX(4) only extends to PT ICD
and not its shareholders.

Having determined that the BIT requires a separate act of consent, the Tribunal will first
address whether the BIT requires that such consent be necessarily provided after the filing
of a request of arbitration, as argued by Indonesia, or whether it can also be provided in
advance, as submitted by Planet. For Indonesia, Article XI(4)(a) contemplates a two-step
procedure, requiring the investor to first file its request for arbitration, and only then could
the host State give its consent.

. Pursuant to Article X1(4)(a), Indonesia agreed to provide its consent in writing within 45

days from receiving the Claimant’s request for arbitration. Indonesia's argument that it has
discretion to withhold its consent, in particular if the admission requirement of Article III(1)
is not fulfilled, is refuted by the wording of Article XI(4)(a). The use of the word “shall”
without a stated exception leaves no doubt that Indonesia was obliged to grant its consent.
Further, Article XI contains no link to Article III(1) (or any other provision of the Treaty for
that matter), nor does Article III(1) refer to Article XI. While Indonesia’s objection under
Article IIIl(1) may eventually be well-founded, it is not for Indonesia to make that
determination at the level of its consent under Article X1(4)(a), but for this Tribunal ruling on
its jurisdiction.

65

202. Furthermore, the wording of Article XI(4)(a) does not exclude the possibility of providing

203.

204.

205.

 

consent in writing prior to the request for arbitration. The Tribunal understands the 45 day
time limit of Article X1(4)(a) as precisely a limit indicating the latest time when consent is
due. One cannot read into Article XI(4)(a) a prohibition of advance consent or a fortiori to
refuse jurisdiction in cases where the advance consent of the host State is established.
What matters is not when the State has given its consent, but whether the State did
consent.

Having determined that consent in writing provided prior to the filing of the request for
arbitration is compatible with Article XI(4)(a), the Tribunal will now examine whether the
BKPM Approvals contain an expression of consent to ICSID arbitration. The Parties
provided slightly different unofficial translations of Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM
Approval. The Claimant's version reads as follows:

“In the event of a dispute between the company and the Government
of the Republic of Indonesia that cannot be resolved by consensus,
the Government of Indonesia [is] willing to follow the settlement
according to the provisions of the Convention on the settlement of
disputes between States and Foreign Citizen regarding investments
in accordance with Law Number 5 Year 1968”.7°° (Emphasis added)

Indonesia’s version reads:

“In the event of dispute between the company and the Government of
the Republic of Indonesia which cannot be settled by
consultation/deliberation, the Government of Indonesia is
prepared/ready to follow settlement according to the provisions of the
convention on the settlement of disputes between States and Foreign
Citizen regarding investments in accordance with Law Number 5 Year
1968”.°64 (Emphasis added)

In its original wording, Section IX(4) reads as follows:

“Dalam hal terjadi perselisihan antara perusahaan dengan
Pemerintah Republik Indonesia yang tidak dapat diselesaikan secara
musyawarah, Pemerintah Indonesia bersedia mengikuti penyelesaian
menurut ketentuan konvensi tentang penyelesaian perselisihan
antara Negara dan Warga Negara Asing mengenai penanaman
modal sesuai dengan Undang-undang Nomor 5 Tahun 1968”.

Ext P-3. The Claimant also relied on two other exhibits containing a translation of this clause, see

and Exh. C-17 in the parallel case. The translations are identical in all three versions.

206. In the course of the proceedings, the Claimant argued that the word perusahaan is

correctly translated as “enterprise”, not as “company”. The Parties were also in
disagreement on the meaning of the word bersedia, the Claimant seeing in it an
expression of consent, the Respondent merely a disposition to envisage following ICSID
procedures. 7°

The 2005 BKPM Approval was granted to the founders of PT ICD, i.e. to Mr. Rinaldi, an
Indonesian national, and Profit Point Group Ltd, a company registered in the British Virgin
Islands.”°° Following the acquisition of PT ICD by Churchill and Planet on 24 April 2006,
the BKPM issued on 8 May 2006 a new approval incorporating the content of the 2005
approval.?6”

Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM approval must be considered to contain an expression of
consent to ICSID arbitration. The disagreement between the Parties on the correct
translation of the word bersedia is irrelevant, since even the formulation “is
[ready/prepared/willing] to follow settlement according to the provisions” of ICSID
expresses consent to submit disputes to ICSID. During cross-examination, the Claimant’s
expert convincingly explained that the expression bersedia mengikuti is an act of consent:

“DR. MAKARIM: After ‘bersedia’ comes the word ‘mengikuti’.
‘Mengikuti’, in my mind, refers to something that exists, that is already
there, which is the dispute settlement between the convention — the
provisions of the convention of dispute settlement

Q. Thank you. My understanding is that ‘mengikuti’ — and | don’t know

consulting English-Indonesian dictionaries. See J. Echols, H. Shadily, Kamus Indonesia-Inggris: An
Indonesian-English Dictionary, 3° edition (Jakarta, Penerbit PT Gramedia Pustaka Utama, 1989),
p. 219 (Exh. CLA-141). Mengikuti is translated as follows: “1 follow, accompany. Saya ~ anak saya

willingness or preparedness or readiness to bring a hypothetical dispute to the attention of
the President of Indonesia and ask him to grant Indonesia’s consent to ICSID proceedings
does not reflect the content of Section IX(4). There is no mention of the BKPM or the
Presidency in Section IX(4), but of the Government of Indonesia which expresses its
willingness “to follow settlement according to the provisions” of the ICSID Convention. If
Indonesia is ready (or prepared, or willing) to settle the dispute according to the provisions
of the ICSID Convention, then it can only mean that Indonesia consented to ICSID
jurisdiction.

Having determined that Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval contains Indonesia's
expression of consent to ICSID arbitration, the Tribunal must now determine whether this
consent extends only to PT ICD, as argued by Indonesia, or also to its shareholders, as
advanced by Planet.

. The Parties’ divergence on this issue hinges on the translation of the word perusahaan.

While both Parties filed unofficial translations of the 2005 BKPM Approval translating
perusahaan as “company”,”°° the Claimant argued during the hearing and in its later
submissions that the word perusahaan must be translated as “enterprise”.?”? To
substantiate its position, the Claimant relied on a dictionary definition of perusahaan, which

"271 and on Amco v. Indonesia. The

lists “business, enterprise, undertaking, concern
tribunal there relied on the same definition as the Claimant here and stressed that the term
“company” is not listed as a possible translation of perusahaan.’” The Claimant also
highlighted that the 2005 BKPM Approval utilizes both terms perusahaan and perseroan,
the latter being correctly translated as “company”. On this basis, it argued that the term

perseroan would have been used if only PT ICD were to benefit from Section IX(4).2” As a

result, the Claimant contended that Section IX(4) extends to PT ICD’s shareholders, a
position rejected by the Respondent.?”

Several elements lead the Tribunal to conclude that Section IX(4) extends to PT ICD’s
shareholders. First, the dictionary on record does not translate perusahaan as company or
corporation, but gives it the broader meaning of business or enterprise.*” It is also
noteworthy that PT ICD is a perseroan terbatas, that is a limited liability company, further
underlining that the word perusahaan may have a broader meaning. Second, the 2005

278 while

BKPM Approval employs the word perusahaan thirteen times in various contexts,
the word perseroan appears twice, each time in the context of PT ICD’s corporate
capital.2” This suggests that the word perseroan is employed in matters relating
exclusively to the corporate vehicle, such as the composition of the corporate capital, and
that the word perusahaan designates the enterprise including its shareholders. Third, a
review of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law also indicates that the word perseroan is
employed when the corporation is targeted exclusively*” and that perusahaan is broad
enough to encompass the shareholders. For instance, Article 1 refers to the direct foreign
capital investment to be used to run the perusahaan, whereby “the owner of the capital
directly bears the risk of the investment”.?”° While the word perusahaan is used in various
contexts, the word perseroan only appears in the context of corporate tax exemptions,
again suggesting that perseroan is employed for matters limited to the corporation. Fourth,
the Tribunal finds further support for its understanding in the 2006 BKPM Approval, which
allowed PT ICD to become wholly owned by foreign investors. While the word perseroan is
again used in connection with PT ICD’s corporate capital, the word perusahaan is
employed in the context of the obligation to sell shares of PT ICD to Indonesian nationals
within 15 years from the start of commercial operations.” It is clear that this requirement
affects primarily PT ICD’s shareholders whose rights of ownership are directly at stake.

Beyond the words, what is further determinative is that PT ICD is a mere instrumentality of
foreign investors, who have no choice but to structure their investment through a local
vehicle.”®' The whole purpose of the 2005 BKPM Approval is precisely to approve a

foreign investment. In this context, and relying on Amco Asia,”®?

it makes sense that
Section IX(4) was meant to protect the foreign investor, constrained to act through its
instrumentality. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM
Approval extends to the parent companies of PT ICD. Since the 2006 BKPM Approval
expressly incorporates the terms of the 2005 BKPM Approval, the Tribunal is of the view

that Section IX(4) extends to Planet.

Having found that the BKPM Approvals express consent which is applicable to Planet, the
Tribunal must now deal with Indonesia’s last argument according to which the BKPM lacks
authority to grant consent to ICSID proceedings, since this prerogative rests with the
Presidency. Indonesia’s contention is based on Law No. 5 of 1968 on the approval to the
ICSID Convention, which provides that “[t]he Government has the authority to give
consent” to ICSID*** and on Article 4(1) of Indonesia’s Constitution pursuant to which the
President holds the “power of governance”.*

In the Tribunal’s view, Indonesia’s argumentation is founded on an excessively narrow
reading of the provisions just referred to. Indeed, the Government of Indonesia cannot be
reduced to the Presidency and several texts demonstrate that the BKPM is part of the
Government. According to Article 1 of Presidential Decree No. 33 of 1981, the BKPM is a
“Non Departmental Government Institution under and accountable directly to the
President”.”®° Article 1(2) of Presidential Decree No. 29 of 2004 further states that the
BKPM is a “Government institution which handles capital investment activities within the
framework of Foreign Capital Investment and Domestic Capital Investment”.*°° This decree
specifies that BKPM’s activities include the implementation of capital investment policies
and development planning, promotion and cooperation, approvals, permits and facilities,
control, and management of information systems. BKPM being a government body vested

with authority to handle foreign investments, there can be no doubt that it has the power to
grant consent to ICSID arbitration under Law No.5 of 1968.

. This understanding is reinforced by the fact that the 2005 BKPM Approval was copied to

the Presidency along with numerous ministries and agencies. Had the President deemed
that the BKPM had overstepped its authority, then he would or should have intervened to
rectify such mistake. Having failed to do so, Indonesia cannot now argue that the BKPM
lacked authority to grant consent to ICSID proceedings.

To conclude, the Tribunal finds that Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval contains an
expression of consent to ICSID proceedings and that the consent extends to PT ICD’s
shareholders, i.e. in the present case Planet. Since Section IX(4) is contained in an
investment approval, it fulfills the requirement of consent in writing under Article X1(4)(a) of
the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.

4. Conclusion

In light of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal holds that Article XI of the Australia-
Indonesia BIT contains no standing offer to arbitrate before ICSID, but that the BKPM
Approvals fulfill the requirement of consent in writing under Article XI of the BIT and Article
25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Hence, it must dismiss Indonesia’s first jurisdictional
objection.

The Tribunal will now assess whether Indonesia’s consent extends to Planet's investment
in light of Indonesia’s second objection under Article III(1)(a) of the BIT.

SECOND OBJECTION: THE CLAIMANT’S INVESTMENTS ARE NOT PROTECTED UNDER THE BIT

1. The Respondent's position

Indonesia submits two related arguments with regard to the admission requirement. First,
Indonesia contends that it legitimately withheld its consent because the BIT expressly
limits its scope to investments having been granted admission in accordance with the 1967
Foreign Capital Investment Law. Second, Indonesia submits that, even if arguendo the
Tribunal were to find that Indonesia consented to ICSID arbitration as a general matter, the

71

22

222.

223.

224.

Tribunal would still lack jurisdiction because the Claimant’s investments fall outside the
scope of protected investments under the BIT.

1.1 The investments fall outside the scope of Article III(1) of the Australia-Indonesia
BIT

. Article III(1) of the Australia-Indonesia BIT provides that the Treaty shall only apply to

those investments that have been granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign
Investment Law.”*” According to Indonesia, this “admitted investments” clause limits the
scope of protected investments under the BIT, even if the Tribunal were to find that
Indonesia gave its consent to ICSID arbitration.” In this case, Indonesia contends that
Planet must be denied protection because it has not been granted admission pursuant to
the 1967 law or any law amending or replacing it.

1.2 The stringent threshold requirement of the “admitted investments” clause

For the Respondent, the admission clause is very important for developing countries such
as Indonesia, as it allows them to screen foreign investments and thereby safeguard their
strategic natural resources.” Its primary effect is to condition “the extension of treaty
protections on prior approval of specified investments”.7°°

Relying on Mytilineos v. Serbia and Montenegro, Indonesia argues that Article III(1) sets a
higher standard than more conventional legality clauses.”*' Indonesia therefore invites the
Tribunal to follow other arbitral tribunals and to dismiss Planet’s case ab initio.*°*

1.3 The investments have not been granted admission in accordance with the 1967
Foreign Investment Law

At the hearing, the Respondent highlighted the fact that the BKPM did not have the
opportunity to review PT ICD’s articles of association before granting its approval on
23 November 2005, although the Respondent acknowledged that PT ICD was granted

a

admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Investment Law and that the BKPM
approved the Claimant's acquisition of PT ICD in 2006.?°

Indonesia interprets the admission requirement not as a threshold whereby once
admission has been granted the requirement is fulfilled, but as a continuous process
whereby a foreign investor violates the admission requirement when engaging in activities
that are not covered by the terms of the BKPM approval.” In particular, the Respondent
argues that (i) by entering into a series of agreements,”*

Deed of Beneficial Control and Ownership,” the Claimant violated Article 33 of the 2007

especially by concluding the

Investment Law; and (ii) by engaging in mining activities and not confining itself to
providing mining services, the Claimant violated the terms of its admission.”%”

In connection with the first argument, the Respondent seeks to rebut the Claimant's
submission that the Bupati of East Kutai authorized it to enter into legal relationships with
the Ridlatama companies.” According to the Respondent, the Bupati’s authorization was
given on condition of abiding with prevailing laws, which the Claimant did not do because it
engaged in mining activities.

Furthermore, the Respondent expanded during the hearing on what it called “indications of
forgery” in its previous submissions.* It argued that there were many irregularities in
certain important documents submitted by the Claimant, including the KP Exploration
Licenses and the maps annexed thereto.*°° Asked to elucidate the link between the forgery
accusations and its jurisdictional objection, the Respondent answered as follows:

“[Tribunal:] Before that, what is the link between this issue and your
jurisdictional objection?

[Respondent:] This is basically to show that there is no interest

whatsoever that the claimant has with respect to the substance

matter, that is, the revocations of KP”.°*"
With respect to the Respondent's second argument related to mining activities, the
Respondent states that Planet, through Churchill, announced on 5 April 2007 and
23 May 2007 that they made a promising coal discovery, 95% of which being situated in
the PT RTM block.*? Stressing that PT RTM allegedly received a mining undertaking
license for general survey on 24 May 2007 only, that is after the announcements, the
Respondent contends that “Churchill [and therefore also Planet] and/or PT RTM and/or
PT RTP illegally undertook such mining survey activities as drilling in the areas for which

they did not hold a license”.°°°

1.4 PT ICD’s business field only covers mining support services

Indonesia acknowledges that the Claimant's investments took the form of ownership of
PT ICD, a local subsidiary, which received approval to operate as a foreign direct
investment company under Indonesian law.°* However, PT ICD’s business field was
described in the 2005 BKPM Approval as “General Mining Support Services”.°® Similarly,
PT ICD’s Articles of Association define the company’s “objective and purpose” as

“business of geological and mining services”.°°

. In support of this argument, the Respondent confronted Dr. Makarim in cross-examination

with one of his articles published in the Jakarta Post.*”” In this article, referring to PMA
companies in general and not to PT ICD in particular, Dr. Makarim had expressed the
following opinion:

“Also, the company’s articles of association must have contained
Objectives and Purposes clauses which would most likely limit its
activities to mining services, not mining activities. [...] Conducting
activities that may be constructed as mining would be beyond its

actions”.°°°
On that basis, the Respondent argues that “in order to achieve that purpose and objective,
and of course if the activity [...] is interpreted that it is a mining activities [sic], it will be
illogical that you can do mining activities to achieve the purpose of objective of undertaking

mining supporting services”.°°°

1.5 The Claimant could only engage in mining activities by concluding a contract of
work or a coal cooperation agreement (PKP2B) with the Indonesian
Government

Under the 1967 Mining Law and the 1980 Regulation No. 27 on Categorization of
Extractive Materials, coal is classified as a strategic natural resource regulated through a
multi-step application process for obtaining mining authorizations.

According to the Respondent, the Claimant could only engage in mining activities such as
exploitation of a mining site by obtaining a PKP2B - a so-called coal cooperation
agreement — which the Claimant should have concluded with the Government.*'° However,
neither PT ICD, nor the Claimant, nor PT TCUP in which the Claimant acquired a majority
in 2010, ever applied for a PKP2B.°"'

Specifically, under the 1967 Foreign Investment Law, foreign investors can only engage in
the field of mining on the basis of direct cooperation with the Government. Article 8(1) of
this act provides that “[floreign capital investment in the field of mining shall be based on a
cooperation with the Government on the basis of a contract of work (‘kontrak karya’) or
other form in accordance with applicable laws and regulations”.°"*

Under Article 1(1) of the 2004 Decree of the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources No.
1614,°"° the contract of work just referred to is defined as “an agreement between the
Government of the Republic of Indonesia with Indonesian legal entity company in the

“agreement between the Government of the Republic of Indonesia with Indonesian legal
entity company in the framework of Foreign Investment to conduct extractive material coal
mining undertaking”.*"*

As mentioned in the Respondent’s submission, the Claimant could only have engaged in
mining activities (as opposed to mining services) by entering into a PKP2B with the central
Government. Under Decree No. 1614 just referred to, the role of the BKPM is merely to
forward the foreigner’s investment application to the relevant ministries and the President,
who must approve the coal cooperation agreement. Article 24 of such decree states that a
draft PKP2B “that has obtained recommendation from BKPM and has been consulted with
the House of People’s Representatives of the Republic of Indonesia is therefore submitted
by the Minister for approval to the President”.*'® Once approval has been obtained from
the President, Article 25 of Decree No. 1614 directs that the PKP2B must be signed by the

Minister “on behalf of the Government’.°"°

In sum, the BKPM Approvals did not allow PT ICD or Planet to engage in mining activities

per se. By doing so Planet failed to observe the limits set forth in the BKPM Approvals.°"”

1.6 The Claimant circumvented the law by securing beneficial ownership in the
Ridlatama licenses

. Indonesia advances that only Indonesian nationals or companies can obtain KP licenses to

engage in mining activities. PMAs such as PT ICD and foreign investors cannot obtain KP
licenses.°"*

. Indonesia further submits that Article 33 of the 2007 Investment Law, promulgated on 26

April 2007°"° and replacing the 1967 Foreign Investment Law*”° prohibits beneficial

ownership by declaring that ownership and benefits associated with it are indivisible.**'
Article 33(1) stipulates that “[dljomestic investor and foreign investor which undertake
capital investment in the form of a limited liability company are prohibited from making any
agreement and/or statement which confirms that ownership of share(s) in a limited liability
company is for and on behalf of other party”. Article 33(2) then declares any such
agreement null and void by operation of law.°”? For the Respondent, various arrangements
entered into by PT ICD on behalf of the Claimant violate Article 33 and are therefore null
and void. Therefore, the Claimant should be denied protection under the BITs.

. In this context, Indonesia emphasizes that Dr. Makarim fails to address Article 33 of the

2007 Investment Law in his first expert report, but has acknowledged in a recent press
article that Indonesian law prohibits arrangements of beneficial ownership.*°

Indonesia claims that Churchill and Planet, through PT ICD, have entered into a series of
arrangements with the Ridlatama companies and their owners which breach the 2007
Investment law by providing beneficial ownership to PT ICD, and thus ultimately to
Churchill and Planet. Specifically, it makes the following assertions:*™*

- The 22 May 2007 Deed of Beneficial Control and Ownership between PT ICD and
PT RS, PT RP, PT RTM, PT RTP and PT TCUP violates Article 33 as it provides for
PT ICD’s 75% beneficial ownership and control of these companies.**°

- The 25 May 2007 agreements (the cooperation agreement, the investors
agreement, the pledge of shares agreements, and the powers of attorney) were
concluded to allow the Claimant to engage in mining activities going beyond mere
mining services and to obtain 75% of the mining revenue. Therefore they violated
the 2007 Investment Law.°°

- The 28 November 2007 agreements (the second cooperation agreement, the
second investor's agreement, the new pledge of shares agreements) also sought to

secure PT ICD’s benefits accruing from the KP licenses, thus violating the 2007
Investment Law.*?”

- The 31 March 2008 agreements between PT ICD and PT IR and PT INP as well as
with Mmes. Florita and Setiawan also breached the 2007 Investment Law.**

Indonesia believes that Planet knew that it was prohibited to own shares in Indonesian
companies holding KP licenses, as Article 5.7 of the 25 May 2007 Cooperation Agreement
states that “[i]f there is any change in the law of the Republic of Indonesia which allows
ICD to hold TCUP’s shares in each of the KP Holders, TCUP and the KP Holders shall
provide all necessary assistance ... to ensure that such shares are transferred to ICD”.**°

Finally, Indonesia explains that it was not aware of these agreements because the
Claimant operated under confidentiality agreements. However, when the Regent of East
Kutai became aware in 2009 of the beneficial control exerted by the Claimant, most
notably through Churchill's press releases in which it claimed to have become the owner of
the EKCP coal reserves, he immediately requested clarification from Churchill and the
London Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”).°°° The Regent also informed the Claimant
that it could not own any interests in Indonesian companies holding KP licenses, and that
he had never issued a PKP2B or a KP license to them or to PT ICD or PT TCUP.**!

In any event, the Claimant's interest in PT TCUP cannot find protection under the BIT, so
the Respondent submits, because it was obtained after the revocation decrees of
4 May 2010. According to the Respondent, PT TCUP amended its articles of association
on 16 April 2010 to authorize a capital increase and issue new shares. That amendment
was approved by the Minister of Law and Human Rights on 15 June 2010, and only
thereafter did PT ICD obtain a 99.01% direct interest in PT TCUP and Churchill the
remaining 0.99%. Planet accordingly had an indirect interest in PT TCUP as a shareholder
of PT ICD.

Thus, the Claimant is barred from invoking any rights in respect to its interest in PT TCUP
as it acquired its interest in PT TCUP when the mining licenses were already revoked.

2. The Claimant’s position

2.1 The Claimant’s investments have been admitted in accordance with the BIT

For the Claimant, Indonesia fails to explain the content of the admission requirement under
the BIT and conflates that requirement with the larger legality requirement.*

2.2 The meaning of the “admission” requirement

The Claimant submits that, in ordinary usage and in light of the context in the Australia-
Indonesia BIT, the term “admitted” means “allowed” or “approved for entry”.*** Therefore,
the admission requirement is applicable at the time when making the investment and, once
approved, the investment is covered by the BIT.**

To support its interpretation of the term “admitted”, the Claimant relies on similarly worded
provisions in the Australia-New Zealand-ASEAN FTA*® and the ASEAN Comprehensive
Investment Agreement.* The Claimant also relies on Desert Line Projects v. Yemen,
where the tribunal found that, in the absence of a specifically defined manner of certifying
acceptance, a general endorsement of the investment at the highest level of the State
satisfies the admission requirement.*”’ Finally, the Claimant disputes Indonesia’s reliance
on Gruslin v. Malaysia and Yaung Chi Oo Trading Pte Ltd v. Myanmar, because the facts
underlying the present dispute are different.*°

The Claimant rejects the Respondent's expansive reading of the admission requirement,
which it seemingly convolutes with the “in accordance with the law” requirement: “[I]t is our
further submission that once this admission is granted, the investment activity can
commence within Indonesia without the need for further admissions. Indeed, the whole
point of admission is a singular act. If separate admissions were required for all

investments subsequently, this would amount to a compliance with law requirement, which
has been explicitly distinguished by authorities and also, of course, by a plain meaning of

the term”.*°

. Therefore, relying on Hamester v. Ghana, the Claimant insisted on the distinction between

“legality a[t] the time of the initiation of the investment” and “legality during the performance
of the investment”,*“° the first aspect relating to jurisdiction and the second one to the
merits.

2.3 All investments were granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign
Capital Investment Law and the 2007 Investment Law

According to the Claimant, all of its investments have been established in accordance with
the relevant foreign investment laws and granted admission by the competent authorities.
PT ICD was granted a BKPM Approval in 2005 and received a Permanent Business
License in 2007. After PT ICD’s acquisition by Churchill and Planet in 2006, BKPM again
granted its approval. All further investment activities also received authorization by the
relevant authorities. In support, the Claimant recalls that under both the 1967 Foreign
Investment Law**' and the 2007 Investment Law which replaced it,*“* the BKPM is the
agency with authority to grant admission to foreign investors in Indonesia.*“*

Relying on the 2005 BKPM Approval, the Claimant further submits that PT ICD received
the authorization to engage in mining activities for a period of 30 years. In that regard,
Dr. Makarim points out that “once the BKPM issued its 2006 Approval and the MEMR
issued a Mineral, Coal and Geothermal Mining Business License, PT ICD was admitted
into Indonesia under the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law’.** Dr. Makarim further
states that none of PT ICD’s subsequent investment activity required additional approvals
to fulfill the admission requirement under the BIT.*°

In any event, according to the Claimant, it received all the necessary authorizations and
approvals, in particular:

- The 2006 BKPM Approval;

- The 2006 Mineral, Coal and Geothermal Mining Business License from the Ministry
of Energy and Mineral Resources;

- The 2007 BKPM Permanent Business License; and
- The 2011 Mineral, Coal and Geothermal Mining Business License from the Ministry

of Energy and Mineral Resources.*“°

In each of these approvals or licenses, PT ICD’s foreign shareholding is explicitly
mentioned, a clear recognition by Indonesia that these approvals concerned an investment
by foreigners.”

. In addition to disputing that it engaged in mining activities per se in violation of the relevant

mining licenses, the Claimant argues that Indonesia’s allegation that it circumvented the
law by restructuring the investment — besides being wrong — has no bearing on the
fulfillment of the admission requirement.

Furthermore, the Claimant disputes that PT ICD could only engage in mining activities in
the coal sector by concluding a PKP2B with the Government;** that PT ICD’s mining
license only covered mining services in a limited sense;*° that Churchill or Planet engaged
in mining activity without permission;* and that the contractual arrangements with the
Ridlatama companies violated Article 33 of the 2007 Investment Law.*°"

2.4 The Claimant’s investments have otherwise been made in accordance with
Indonesian law

2.4.1. The Australia-Indonesia BIT contains no legality requirement

The Claimant stresses that Indonesia does not contest that the Australia-Indonesia BIT
contains no express legality requirement.** In the absence of such requirement, the
Claimant puts forward that Indonesia “cannot claim plausibly that any illegality in the

Claimani[’s] investment, other than lack of proper admission, would deprive this Tribunal of
jurisdiction’? The Claimant also notes that Indonesia has failed to substantiate its
position with a single authority, except for references where the definition of investment
included a legality requirement.°***

2.4.2 Planet never performed mining per se

The Claimant challenges Indonesia’s allegations that it engaged in mining operations
without the necessary authorizations. There is no evidence showing what activities qualify
as mining services as opposed to actual mining: “Where in the process from prospecting
for coal [...] to the extraction and sale of coal, can it be said that mining services starts or
stops; or which activities within the process from start to finish are services as opposed to
actual mining?”
In any event, the Claimant denies having performed mining per se, save for drilling in
conformity with the KP Exploration Licenses granted to the Ridlatama companies.* At the
hearing, it recalled that “the licenses were revoked when only 20 per cent of the territory
[covered by them] had been fully explored. No mine was ever opened. No mine was ever
operational. No coal was ever mined from the East Kutai Coal Project”.°°”

2.4.3 The Respondent's accusations of document forgery are not supported by

evidence

. The Claimant strongly rejects the Respondent's accusations raised during the hearing

regarding allegedly forged documents in the record. It explains that some document
irregularities may be due to clerical errors made by officials in the Regency of East Kutai.
Notwithstanding, the fact that the Respondent has not acted on these accusations much
earlier is sufficient to rebut them.*°°

2.4.4 The Respondent's objection could only have a bearing on the merits, not
on jurisdiction

Finally, the Claimant contends that Indonesia’s reliance on World Duty Free v. Kenya and
Plama v. Bulgaria is misleading to the extent that its introduction of the legality requirement
at the jurisdictional stage conflates jurisdiction with admissibility, which is a merits issue.°°°
The Tribunal should not refuse to afford Planet a forum to adjudicate its claims. In any
event, Indonesia has not reserved admissibility as a preliminary question, which could
therefore only affect the merits if at all.

3. Analysis

. Having determined that Indonesia’s expression of consent in the BKPM Approvals satisfies

the requirements of Article XI(4)(a) of the Treaty, the Tribunal must now determine the
scope of Indonesia's consent in light of Indonesia’s second jurisdictional objection. It must
in particular determine whether Planet’s investment is covered by the Treaty.

In light of the Parties’ arguments, the Tribunal will first analyze Article III(1)(a) of the Treaty
so as to determine the meaning of the words “granted admission” (3.1.). Thereafter, it will
turn to the Indonesian Foreign Investment Law referred to in Article IlII(1)(a) of the BIT
(3.2.) and to the BKPM Approvals (3.3.).

3.1 The admission requirement under Article III(1)(a) of the BIT
Article III(1)(a) of the Australia-Indonesia BIT reads as follows:

“1. This Agreement shall apply to:

(a) investments of investors of Australia in the territory of the Republic
of Indonesia which have been granted admission in accordance with

the Law No. 1 of 1967 concerning Foreign Investment or with any law
amending or replacing it”.°°°

It is common ground that Article III(1) limits the application of the BIT to investments that
have been granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Investment Law (or any
successive statute). By contrast, the Parties are in disagreement on the temporal scope of

Tr. 14052013, 77:20-25.
Exh. CLA-19.

83

267.

269.

270.

application of Article IIl(1)(a), ie. whether the requirement implies admission once upon
entry into the country, as argued by the Claimant, or whether it extends through the entire
duration of the investment operation, as advocated by the Respondent.

In accordance with the rules of treaty interpretation, the Tribunal will start by ascertaining
the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article III(1)(a). This provision requires an investment
to “have been granted admission” by Indonesia under the 1967 Foreign Investment Law.
According to the Oxford Dictionary of English, the verb “to admit” means “to allow” or “to
accept”.**' That same dictionary defines the noun “admission” as “the process or fact of

entering or being allowed to enter a place or organization”.°*

. The content of this definition and the observation that the admission must “have been

granted” by the host State, leads the Tribunal to understand that the admission
requirement set forth in Article III(1) is a one-time occurrence, a gateway through which all
Australian investors must pass once.

The context confirms this understanding. Article Ill is entitled “Scope of Agreement’,
implying that investments that do not meet the requirements under Article III will not find
protection under the Australia-Indonesia Treaty, even if the underlying operation qualifies
as an investment under Article I(1)(a). The admission requirement is consequently of
jurisdictional nature. As such, it necessarily applies at the time of entry into the country and
not during the entire operation of the project. This conclusion is further confirmed by
previous arbitral decisions.°®

Having reached this conclusion, the Tribunal addresses certain additional arguments and
cases which the Parties invoked. In this context, it agrees with the Claimant that the
admission requirement embodied in Article III(1)(a) is narrower than a traditional legality
requirement in the sense that it only demands admission in accordance with the relevant
domestic laws and not general compliance with the host State’s legislation.

Contrary to the Respondent's position, the Tribunal does not find that Mytilineos, Gruslin,
and Yaung Chi Oo support the Respondent's argument. In Mytilineos, the tribunal was
called upon to interpret a general “in accordance with the legislation” provision contained in
the Greece-Yugoslavia BIT and the tribunal expressly mentioned that the treaty did not
require any registration of investments.°*

The Gruslin decision is also inapposite here. It is true that the Belgium-Malaysia
Intergovernmental Agreement under scrutiny there required that the assets be invested in
Malaysia in an “approved project” classified as such by the relevant Ministry.°%° The sole
arbitrator found that this requirement was not satisfied through a general approval of the
business activity, since the specific “project” needed approval.°% In the view of the
Tribunal, Gruslin must be distinguished, since the thrust of Indonesia’s argument is that
Planet violated Indonesian laws after the approval of its investment, not in the making of
the investment.

Finally, in Yaung Chi Oo, the tribunal refused jurisdiction on the ground that the investment
had not obtained an additional approval in line with the requirements of the 1987 ASEAN
Agreement.*” It held that all investors, including those who were already admitted in
Myanmar prior to the entry into force of the ASEAN Agreement, had to apply for approval
in conformity with Article II(3) of that treaty to benefit from treaty protection.** The investor
failed to do so and, hence, jurisdiction was denied.*°

In sum, none of these cases support Indonesia’s argument that the admission requirement
extends throughout the duration of the investor's activity. In other words, the admission
requirement under Article III(1)(a) of the Treaty is restricted to the time of the initiation of
the investment. The Tribunal must thus analyze the content of the admission requirement
under the relevant legislation.

law was amended in 1970 in respect of matters of no relevance here,°”' and then replaced
on 26 April 2007 by the Investment Law No. 25 (2007 Investment Law’).*” As to the 2007
Investment Law, the Respondent acknowledges that it does not diverge significantly from
its predecessor, save for the addition of Article 33.°”°

It is common ground that Planet acquired its interests in PT ICD on 24 April 2006 and that
it obtained the BKPM Approval for this acquisition on 8 May 2006,°” i.e. before the entry
into force of the 2007 Investment Law. The Tribunal will thus assess the present objection
by application of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law.

Article 1 of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law provides that it applies to “direct foreign
capital investment” made in Indonesia.*’® Article 2 defines foreign capital investment as
including (a) foreign exchange, (b) equipment, and (c) transferable profits used to finance
an enterprise in Indonesia.°” Article 3 defines an enterprise as understood in Article 2 as a
legal entity organized under Indonesian law and domiciled in Indonesia. Under Articles 4
and 5 of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law, the Indonesian Government is empowered to
determine the operating area for foreign capital and the fields of activity which are open to
foreign investment.

Regarding the field of mining activities, Article 8(1) of the law requires cooperation with the
Government by way of a work contract or otherwise:

“Foreign investment in the field of mining shall be carried out in
cooperation with the Government on the basis of a work contract
(“kontrak karya’) or other form in accordance with revailing [sic]
regulations”.°””

Law No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967) (Exh. CLA-2; Exh. RLA-006). See RMOJ, § 41. The
Parties submitted different English versions of the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law. However,

Finally, about the implementation of the law, Article 28(1) provides for coordination in the
following terms:

“Provisions of this Law shall be implemented by coordination among

the Government agencies concerned in order to ensure

harmonization of Government policies regarding foreign capital”.°”
Article 28(2) specifies that further provisions will be adopted in respect of procedures for
the coordination contemplated in paragraph 1. The elucidation to Article 28, which is
appended to the law, contemplates the creation of a coordination body. It states that the
“execution of this Law involves the domains of several Department [sic]. For that reason it
is necessary to have a simple coordination body which may take the form of a council

consisting of the Ministers concerned”.°”°

. This being so, the 1967 Foreign Investment Law does not specify the procedures for a

foreign investor to obtain the governmental approval contemplated in Article III(1)(a) of the
Australia-Indonesia BIT, nor does it designate an authority in charge of implementing the
law. The Parties agree that the BKPM, the Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board, is
the responsible authority to grant the investment approvals contemplated in Article III(1)(a)
of the Australia-Indonesia BIT.°®°

In this respect, the Tribunal notes that, according to the Respondent, the BKPM was only
created in 1973.°"' It further notes that, under the 1981 Presidential Decree No. 33
regarding the Capital Investment Coordinating Board, the BKPM has the duty to assist
Indonesia’s President in formulating investment policies, completing investment approvals
and evaluating their implementation, and issuing business licenses. *®*

In 2004, a so-called “One-Roof Service System” was established by Presidential Decree
No. 29.°8° According to that decree, the BKPM had delegated authority from the relevant

Law No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967), Art. 28(1) (Exh. CLA-2).

Ministries to issue capital investment approvals under the 1967 Foreign Investment Law.
Article 3 of the decree provides that:

“Services of capital investment approvals, permits and facilities as
referred to in Article 2 letter c within the framework of Foreign Capital
Investment and Domestic Capital Investment are carried out by
BKPM, based on delegation of authority by the Minister/Head of Non
Departmental Government Institution which fosters the relevant lines
of business of capital investment through the one-roof service

system”.*®4

. Article 4 of Decree No. 29 further provides that decentralized governmental bodies may

also delegate the authority to grant investment approvals to the BKPM:

“Governor/Regent/Mayor in line with his/her authority may delegate
authority in investment approval, licenses and facilities services as

meant in Article 2 letter c to BKPM (Investment Coordinating Board)
through the one-stop service system”.*°°

In the field of mining, the Ministry of Mining had delegated its authority to the BKPM in
1978 already.*®° As a result of this delegation and of the powers vested in the BKPM under
the Decrees of 1981 and 2004, when Planet applied for its investment approval, the BKPM
was the authority competent to grant that approval.

. Consequently, the Tribunal must now determine whether Planet obtained the investment

approval from the BKPM in conformity with Article III(1)(a) of the Australia-Indonesia BIT,
thus enabling it to benefit from protection under the Treaty.

3.3. The BKPM Approvals

It is undisputed that, pursuant to Article 3 of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law, Planet
could only invest in Indonesia through a local vehicle incorporated and domiciled in

sector can only do so through a foreign direct investment company, a so-called
Penanaman Modal Asing (“PMA”).

Planet invested in Indonesia by acquiring a 5% share in an Indonesian PMA called PT
Indonesian Coal Development or PT ICD. PT ICD was initially created by Profit Point
Group Ltd, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi,
an Indonesian national.%®* Profit Point Group Ltd owned 95% of the shares and
Mr. Andreas Rinaldi the remaining 5%.

The Respondent acknowledges that PT ICD “received an approval from BKPM to be a
Penanaman Modal Asing (PMA — foreign direct investment) company, operating as a
Perseroan Terbatas (PT — limited liability company)”.*®° The BKPM approved the
incorporation of PT ICD on 23 November 2005 (the “2005 BKPM Approval”).°°°

The preamble of the 2005 BKPM Approval refers to (1) the 1967 Foreign Investment Law,
(2) the 1967 Mining Law, (3) the 1981 Presidential Decree No. 33 on the BKPM, (4) the
2004 Presidential Decree No. 29 on the One-Roof Service System, and (5) the 1978
Decree on the delegation of powers from the Ministry of Mining to the BKPM.°*' The text of
the 2005 BKPM Approval mentions the identity of the two applicants, the terms of the
project, the name of the new company PT ICD, its business field, and the initial capital
contribution of USD 250,000.°%

. On 24 April 2006, the owners of PT ICD sold their shares to Churchill (95%) and Planet

(5%).°° The change in shareholders was approved by the BKPM on 8 May 2006 (the
“2006 BKPM Approval”),°** a fact that the Respondent concedes. Besides requiring that,
within fifteen years from the start of commercial operations, PT ICD must sell part of its
shares to Indonesian citizens, and that any subsequent change in the share capital must
be approved by the BKPM, the 2006 BKPM Approval incorporates by reference the
content of the 2005 BKPM Approval.

On this basis, and in particular in view of the fact that PT ICD received the necessary
approval by the BKPM in 2005 and that the change in PT ICD’s shareholding was
subsequently approved by the BKPM in 2006, the Tribunal concludes that Planet obtained
the necessary approval when making its investment in May 2006, thus fulfilling the
requirement set in Article III(1)(a) of the Australia-Indonesia BIT.

Therefore, the Tribunal denies Indonesia’s second preliminary objection and concludes
that it has jurisdiction over the present dispute.

The present decision is limited to jurisdiction and does not prejudge any alleged
wrongdoing by the Claimant during the operation of the investment, which is a matter for
the merits.

COSTS

With regard to costs, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal:

“order [Planet] to pay the totality of costs relating to this Arbitration,
including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal,
Respondent’s legal fees and all other amounts incurred by

Respondent”.*°>

. For its part, the Claimant makes the following requests:

“1) Order that Indonesia pay all fees and costs incurred in connection
with the arbitration proceedings, including the costs of the arbitrators
and of ICSID as well as legal and other expenses incurred by the
[Planet] on a full indemnity basis, plus interest accrued thereupon at a
rate to be determined by the Tribunal from the date on which such
costs are incurred to the date of payment; and

2) Award any other relief the Tribunal deems just and appropriate”.°%

Having come to the conclusion that it has jurisdiction, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to
reserve the decision on costs for a later decision.
