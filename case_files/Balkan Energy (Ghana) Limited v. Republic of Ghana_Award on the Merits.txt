B. BACKGROUND TO THE DISPUTE

3. The present dispute concerns a Power Purchase Agreement (the “PPA”) entered into by the
Parties on 27 July 2007, with an effective date of 31 October 2007 (the “Effective Date”).!
Faced with a severe power shortage, in 2007, Ghana entered into negotiations with Balkan US
for the refurbishment and commissioning of the Osagyefo Power Barge (the “Barge”) a one
hundred and twenty-five megawatt (125MW) dual fired (diesel and gas) Power Barge and

associated facilities (the “Power Station”) in Effasu in the Western Region of Ghana, which

Energy and Balkan Energy (Ghana) Limited on Osagyefo Power Barge and Associated Facilities Effasu

was then unused.” Under the PPA, BEL was to commission the Barge within ninety (90)
working days of the Effective Date; convert it into a combined cycle power plant by the additio
of certain facilities; upgrade the capacity of the Barge: and invest in infrastructure to enabl

natural gas to be supplied to the Barge.* For its part, Ghana was to ensure that all electricit ;
necessary for the refurbishment and commissioning of the Barge was provided; facilitate th
acquisition of government approvals, visas, and equipment; construct and install the
transmission line required to connect to Ghana’s national grid (the “National Grid”); and take

and pay for all electricity thereafter generated by the Power Station.”

4, Each Party alleges that the other has failed to perform its obligations under the PPA, The

Claimant contends that the Respondent has failed to provide adequate site electricity;* failed to

   

provide a connection to the National Grid through a proper transmission line;" and failed to
comply with its obligation to facilitate the acquisition and installation of a piece of equipment,
known as a Remote Terminal Unit (the “RTU”), on the Barge.’ The Claimant further contends
that, under Clause 11.9 of the PPA, it is owed tolling fees (“Tolling Fees”) since 28 October
2008, the date on which it alleges that the Power Station would have been completed but for the
Respondent's failure to provide an adequate transmission line and interconnection facilities.
The Tolling Fees are meant not only to cover the cost of electricity but also remunerate the |
Claimant for its investments. The Claimant states that it has, since 25 November 2008, sent the

Respondent invoices totaling over USD 50 million in respect of Tolling Fees.”

5. For its part, the Respondent contends that it has fulfilled its obligations, and that the Power
Station has never been operational because of breaches of the PPA by the Claimant.'’ The
Respondent asserts that none of the arguments raised by the Claimant justifies the Claimant's

failure to complete the commissioning of the Barge." By letter dated 28 August 2009, Ghana’s

Ministry of Energy stated that Ghana had provided BEL with grid connectivity via the
transmission line and interconnection facilities, and asserted that the fact that the Power Station
was not operational was due to BEL’s own inability to complete the facilities.'* The Respondent
also claims that the upgrading of certain necessary equipment on the Barge was not undertaken
by BEL. Relying on statements made by BEL and document production in a lawsuit filed in a
United States District Court against a subcontractor on the Barge (ProEnergy Services LLC),
the Respondent describes the Claimant's assertion that the Barge was operational as
fraudulent. The Respondent also disputes the Claimant’s invoices for Tolling Fees referred to

above.!*

Following challenges raised by the Respondent to the validity of the arbitration clause (the
“Arbitration Agreement’) in the PPA, and generally to the arbitrability of the dispute, the
Tribunal issued an interim award on jurisdiction (the “Interim Award”) on 22 December 2010,

in which it affirmed its competence to decide the present dispute.

The central issue before the Tribunal in this merits phase of the arbitration is whether the
Claimant achieved the “milestone events” set forth in the Third Schedule of the PPA (most
notably, testing and commissioning of the Power Station within ninety (90) working days of the
Effective Date) or, in the alternative, whether the Claimant has demonstrated that it is entitled to
Tolling Fees under Clause 11.9 of the PPA or any other form of damages. The Tribunal must

also decide on the Respondent's counterclaims for breach of contract.’*

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 23 December 2009, the Claimant commenced arbitration against the Respondent pursuant to
Article 22.2 of the PPA and Article 3 of the United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law of 1976 (the “UNCITRAL Rules”). Under the PPA, the dispute shall be governed by the
jaws of the Republic of Ghana.

On 15 January 2010, the Claimant appointed Judge Stephen M. Schwebel as the first arbitrator
and, on 12 March 2010, the Respondent appointed Judge Thomas A. Mensah as the second

arbitrator. On 1 April 2010, the Co-arbitrators selected Professor Francisco Orrego Vicufia as

the President of the Tribunal.

10. The Tribunal’s Interim Award of 22 December 2010 recounts in detail the procedural history of
the arbitration from its commencement up until the date that Award was issued. The Tribunal

will therefore principally focus on developments since December 2010.

11. Shortly after the issuance of the Interim Award, the Tribunal fixed the schedule for the filing of
the Parties’ written pleadings on the merits as follows: 15 July 2011 for the Claimant's
Statement of Claim, 15 January 2012 for the Respondent's Statement of Defense, 15 April 2012

for the Claimant's Reply, and 15 July 2012 for the Respondent’s Rejoinder.

12. On 22 June 2011, the Claimant notified the Tribunal and the PCA that it had retained Mr.
Mitchell Madden to act as co-counsel and requested an extension of “no more than 180 days
and no Jess than 120 days” to submit its Statement of Claim. By letters dated 23 and 27 June
2011, the Respondent advised that it had no objection to the requested extension, provided that
the remaining dates fixed by the Tribunal were also adjusted to reflect the prior symmetry in

each Party’s respective deadlines.

13. On 29 June 2011, the Tribunal granted a 90-day extension for the submission of the Statement
of Claim and amended the schedule for filing of the Parties’ written pleadings on the merits as
follows: 12 October 2011 for the Claimant’s Statement of Claim, 12 April 2012 for the
Respondent's Statement of Defense, 12 July 2012 for the Claimant’s Reply, and 12 October
2012 for the Respondent's Rejoinder.

14. On 17 October 2011, the Claimant submitted a part of its Statement of Claim, with supporting

materials to follow the next day. Claimant’s counsel explained that the transmission of the

Statement of Claim “was deiayed in material part, due to an apparent misapprehension [he] had

It with respect to settlement negotiations that were (unbeknownst to [him] until late Friday, Dallas
‘ time) scheduled to occur in Dallas, Texas on Monday October 17, 2011", and which were

subsequently cancelled.

15. On 18 October 2011, the Tribunal confirmed electronic receipt of the Statement of Claim and

reaffirmed that the Respondent was to submit its Statement of Defense on 12 April 2012.

16. On the same date, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal advising that it had not yet received the

 

exhibits and supporting materials referenced in the Statement of Claim and that the “information

which came to [Claimant’s] counsel's attention ‘late Friday, Dallas time’ — would have been

after the Statement of Claim was due to be filed” on 12 October 2011. The Respondent did not
object to “the late and/or incomplete filing”, but requested that the Tribunal “grant the
Government a similar grace period, should it become necessary, measured from the date on
which the Government receives Balkan’s fully submitted Statement of Claim with supporting
documents”. On 19 October 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was open to granting
a limited extension along the lines envisaged in the Respondent’s letter, if such an extension
became necessary. The Tribunal also instructed the Claimant to proceed without delay in the
event that its full Statement of Claim had not yet been transmitted electronically and by courier

to the Respondent's counsel.

On 26 October 2011, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Statement of Claim (the
“Statement of Claim”). Since the Claimant had made arrangements with a courier service for
its delivery to Respondent’s counsel on 19 October 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties that
it would use 19 October 2011 as the date for calculating any “grace period” to be afforded to the
Respondent to submit its Statement of Defense, should it become necessary. The Tribunal also
reminded the Claimant of its duty, pursuant to Section 2.1.2 of the Tribunal’s Procedural Order
No. 2, dated 27 July 2010, to provide the Tribunal, the opposing Party and the Registry with

hard copies of all exhibits and attachments.

On 9 February 2012, the Claimant provided hard copies of all of the exhibits referenced in its

Statement of Claim.

By letter dated 13 March 2012, the Respondent requested that Paragraph 4.1 of Procedural
Order No. 2 be modified to allow for early document disclosure of certain technical documents

prior to the submission of its Statement of Defense.

On 14 March, the Tribunal invited the Claimant’s comments on the Respondent’s proposal for

early document production by 20 March 2012.

By e-mail dated 20 March 2012, the Claimant notified the Tribunal of its objection to the
Respondent’s request for early document disclosure and requested an extension until 23 March
2012 in which to provide a formal response. By e-mail dated 21 March 2012, the Tribunal

granted the Claimant’s extension request.

On 23 March 2012, the Claimant submitted its formal objection to the Respondent’s request of
13 March 2012, “based upon the inequal process that the requested modification to the

scheduling order would occasion to [sic] and because the Government's request and the

PCA 117830 5

 

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 24 of 264

argument in support of its request, demonstrate the reasonableness and underlying rational of
the procedure as outlined in Section 4.1 of the order”. On 26 March 2012, the Respondent
countered that there was no issue of fairness or unequal treatment, and reiterated its request that
the Tribunal modify Procedural Order No, 2 so as to permit targeted discovery before Ghana

was required to submit its Statement of Defense.

23. On 27 March 2012, upon careful consideration of the Parties’ arguments, the Tribunal decided
to maintain the schedule as provided in Paragraph 4.1 of Procedural Order No. 2 and ruled that
both Parties would “have the opportunity to request production of any documents no later than

15 days after the submission of the Statement of Defense.”

24, On 9 April 2012, the Respondent requested an additional one-week extension, unul 26 April

2012, in which to file its Statement of Defense due to the Easter holiday.
25. The next day, the Claimant advised that it had no objection to the requested extension.

26. By letter dated 10 Apri! 2012, the Tribunal granted the one week extension, thereby amending
ihe schedule for the filing of the Parties’ written pleadings on the merits as follows: 26 April
2012 for the Respondent’s Statement of Defense, 26 July 2012 for the Claimant's Reply, and

26 October 2012 for the Respondent's Rejoinder.

27. On 26 April 2012, the Respondent submitted its Statement of Defense (the “Statement of

Defense”).

28. On 10 May 2012, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to request that it fix a date by which
Ghana should make its request to the Claimant for the production of documents pursuant to
Paragraph 4 of Procedural Order No. 2. By letter of the same date, the Tribunal directed the

Parties to make any requests for production of documents from the other Party by 18 May 2012.

29, By e-mail of the same date, the Respondent requested a thirty-day adjournment to the document
production timetable on account of the dissolution of its lead counsel's firm. On 15 May 2012,

the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal to express its consent to the requested extension.

Ai,

30. By letter dated 16 May 2012, the Tribunal advised the Parties to exchange any document

production requests they may have on 18 June 2012. To accommodate the new timetable for

document production, the Tribunal further advised that the calendar for the Parties’ remaining

substantive submissions would be revised as follows: 6 September 2012 for the Claimant’s

Reply and 5 December 2012 for the Respondent’s Rejoinder.

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 25 of 264

On 23 May 2012, the Respondent notified the Tribunal of the Supreme Court of Ghana’s
decision in the Attorney General v. Balkan Energy Ghana et al. matter rendered on 16 May
2012 (the “Supreme Court Judgment”), and inquired whether the Tribunal wished to receive
the Parties’ respective views on the impact of the Judgment on the present arbitration. On
25 May 2012, the Tribunal invited the Parties to offer any comments they wished to make on

the Judgment, by simultaneous submission on 8 June 2012.

By letter dated 30 May 2012, the Tribunal proposed to hold the hearing on the merits from 24 to
30 April 2013 at the Peace Palace in The Hague.

On I June 2012, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal to request an extension until 20 June 2012
to submit comments on the Supreme Court Judgment, in order to allow it time to request a
review of the decision from the Ghana Supreme Court. On 4 June 2012, the Tribunal invited the
Respondent to comment on the Claimant’s request by 6 June 2012. On 6 June 2012, the
Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, agreeing to the Claimant’s extension request and additionally
requesting a different schedule for the subsequent proceedings in the event that the Claimant
decided to make an application before the Ghana Supreme Court to review the Supreme Court

Judgment.

By letter dated 8 June 2012, the Tribunal approved the Claimant's requested extension and
directed the Parties to simultaneously submit their views, or communicate that they had no

comments on the matter at this stage, on 20 June 2012. The Tribunal further noted that it did

not intend to take a decision on the implications of this Judgment (or any subsequent
decisions that may be issued) until after the hearing on the merits, Consequently the
Respondent's request to open up a period for comments, reply and rejoinder, and attach to.
ita different schedule depending on whether further submissions are made to the Ghana
Supreme Court, does not meet with the Tribunal’s approval at this stage.

  

The Tribunal also ruled that the Parties were {ree to submit additional comments on the matter

in the scheduled Reply and Rejoinder submissions.

Having consulted with the Parties, by letter dated {3 June 2012, the Tribunal confirmed that the
hearing would be held on 24 to 30 April 2013, with 1 and 2 May 2013 held in reserve in the
event that additional time is required. The Tribunal also confirmed that, in view of the earlier

agreement between the Parties, the hearing would be held in London.

On 14 June 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal of its wish to place on the record that,

while it had no objection to holding the merits hearing in London as directed by the Tribunal in

PCA 117830 7

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 26 of 264

     

its 13 June correspondence, choosing London as a hearing venue should not affect the Parties’

agreement that The Hague, the Netherlands be the place of arbitration.

37. By letter dated 18 June 2012. the Tribunal noted that, pursuant to Article 16 of the UNCITRAL
Rules which governs this proceeding, the establishment of an arbitral seat does not preclude the
Tribunal or the Parties from holding hearing or meetings in another location. Recailing Articles
6.1 and 6.3 of the Terms of Appointment, which restate an agreement reached by the Parties and
communicated to the Tribunal in a letter dated 8 June 2010, the Tribunal confirmed “that The
Hague is the place of arbitration (seat) for the present proceedings, whereas London shal] be the

place at which the hearings will be held”.

38. On the same date, the Claimant submitted its Request for Production of Documents to the

Respondent.

©

On 19 June 2012, in response to the Tribunal’s 8 June 2012 letter, the Respondent informed the
Tribunal that it would present its arguments with respect to the effect of the Supreme Court
Judgment in its Rejoinder. The Respondent further noted “that the Claimant apparently chose
nol to seek review of the Supreme Court Judgment, and that the 30 day period provided in the
Rules for filing such an application has now lapsed”. On the same date, the Claimant submitted
its Interim Submission with respect to the Supreme Court Judgment (the “Interim

Submission”).

i 40. By letter dated 21 June 2012, the Tribunal reiterated that it would “not take a decision on the
implications on the Supreme Court Judgment (or any subsequent decisions that may be issued)
unti! after the hearing on the merits at which time it [would] take into consideration the Parties’
views on the matter”, including those expressed by the Parties in their respective letters dated
20 June 2012 and any additional views expressed in the Parties’ forthcoming substantive

submissions.

41. On 6 September 2012, the Claimant submitted its Reply to the Statement of Defense (the
“Reply”).

 

 

42. On 8 November 2012, with the consent of the Claimant, the Respondent requested a two-week
extension, 20 December 2012, to file its Rejoinder due to the hurricane that hit the northeast
coast of the United States. By letter dated 9 November 2012, the Tribunal granted the requested

extension. On 20 December 2012, the Respondent submitted its Statement of Rejoinder (the

 

“Rejoinder’).

On 28 January 2013, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it wished to hold a Procedural
Conference with the Parties by telephone on 7 February 2013, the results of which would be
recorded in a Procedural Order No, 3. To that end, the Tribunal circulated a draft of Procedural
Order No. 3 for the Parties’ advance review. On 7 February 2013, the Parties and the Tribunal
participated in a procedural teleconference. On 12 February 2013, upon consideration of the
Parties’ comments and discussions at the procedural teleconference, the Tribunal issued

Procedural Order No. 3.

By letter dated 4 March 2013, the Claimant requested that Section 2 of Procedural Order No. 3,
as well as the order of the Tribunal dated 16 May 2012, be modified to allow it to submit a
rebuttal expert opinion from a new expert witness. The Claimant also requested that it be able to
reserve the right to request further document production from the Respondent. On 5, 12 and 14

March 2013, the Respondent contested the Claimant’s requests.

By letter dated 18 March 2013, the Tribunal denied the Claimant's application for leave to file a
rebuttal expert report. The Tribunal concluded “that the procedural calendar has provided the

Parties with ample time to gather and file any evidence in support of their case, and [that] the

   

submission of a further expert report at this stage would risk jeopardizing the Parties’ and the
Tribunal’s orderly preparation for the hearing.” The Tribunal also noted that, pursuant to
Section 3.4 of Procedural Order No. 3, it looked forward to receiving a joint scheduling
proposal from the Parties, including their views on the order and grouping of witnesses and
experts, by 25 March 2013. To assist the Parties in their consultations, the Tribunal identified in
general terms, in an Annex to this letter, the topics on which it wished to hear testimony of
witnesses and experts at the hearing. The Tribunal requested that the Parties attempt to group
testimony on related topics, though it acknowledges that it might not be feasible to maintain a
strict grouping by topics in respect of all witnesses/experts. Finally, the Tribunal took note of
the Claimant’s indication that it might wish to request the production of further documents in
the possession of the Respondent and that, if required, the Tribunal would be prepared to decide

any such application by the Claimant after appropriate consultation of the Respondent.

On 21 March 2013, the Claimant requested the Tribunal’s assistance in relation to the
preparation of an agreed Chronology of Facts, attaching its draft Chronology of Facts as
provided to the Respondent. On the same date, recalling its direction in Section 2.1 of
Procedural Order No. 3 ~ that the Parties “endeavor to produce an agreed Chronology of Facts,
to be filed with the Tribunal by March 25, 2013”, with any differences on certain facts indicated

in the same document — the Tribunal advised the Parties that it would be best assisted by a 3-5

page document that lists, in a tabular form and in chronological order, the major material events

underlying the present arbitration,

47. On 22 March 2013, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal disregard the Claimant’s draft
Chronology of Facts, and that it should not constitute part of the record, since it was not a joint

submission, as required by Section 2.1 of Procedural Order No. 3.

48. On 26 March 2013, the Claimant requested that the due date for the agreed Chronology of Facts
be postponed until 26 March 2013.

 

49. On the same date, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would not have regard to the
Claimant’s draft Chronology, which it understood had been attached to the Claimant’s

21 March 2013 letter for purely illustrative purposes.

50. By letter dated 3 April 2013, the Respondent submitted an amended version of Mr. Watson’s
expert report stating that Mr. Watson was able to “be more specific regarding a statement

contained in J 5.22 of his opinion based upon his recent trip to Ghana”.

51. On the same date, the Claimant notified the Tribunal and the Respondent of the new address of
its counsel and requested, with the consent of the Respondent, an extension of time for the

submission of an agreed scheduling proposal.

52. On 5 April 2013, the Tribunal confirmed that the Parties might submit their agreed scheduling

 

proposal pursuant to Section 3.4 of Procedural Order No. 3, as well as any other information

that was to be provided by 3 April 2013 pursuant to Procedural Order No. 3, by 8 April 2013.

53. By letter dated 8 April 2013, the Respondent informed the Tribunal about the results of the
Parties’ consultations pursuant to Procedural Order No. 3, attaching a proposed schedule of
witnesses and experts for the hearing and advising that it would be necessary and appropriate to
make provision for Post-Hearing Memorials. The Claimant proposed that the Parties
simultaneously submit Post-Hearing Memorials on 17 June 2013, followed by simultaneous
Replies on 2 July 2013. The Respondent, however, proposed that there be only one round of

Post-Hearing Memorials, and suggested that the Claimant file its Memorial by 3 June 2013,

 

with the Respondent's Memorial to follow by 2 July 2013.

 

54, On 12 April 2013, the Tribunal confirmed the hearing arrangements regarding hearing bundles

 

and the schedule of proceedings. The Tribunal further noted that at the hearing it would discuss

with the Parties “(a) the amount of time to be allocated to each witness and (b) the modalities

for the submission of Post-Hearing Briefs.”

By letter dated 17 April 2013, the Respond ibmitted its list of dees for the up

 

hearing. On the same date, the Claimant transmitted its list of hearing attendees.

On 19 April, the Claimant submitted its core hearing bundle, pursuant to the Tribunal’s |

direction in its 12 April 2013 letter.

On 22 April 2013, the Claimant supplemented its list of attendees, informing that counsel for

ProEnergy would attend the examination of Mr. John Bryant.

On 23 April 2013, the Claimant submitted additional calculations of Tolling Fees. in which it
sought to draw a distinction between the period leading up to | January 2014 and the period
thereafter. Some elements in the additional calculations, such as the discount rate, appeared to
be new or different, but the bulk of the additional calculations appeared to be an elaboration on

calculations that the Claimant had previously filed as evidence.

The Hearing on the Merits was held on 24 April to 2 May 2013 in London. Present at the

Court Reporter
Mr. Trevor McGowan

documents, which hinders the ability to properly analyze Balkan’s response to the Tribunal”.
The Respondent emphasized that it was essential that it receive from the Claimant revised
versions of certain attachments to its 7 June 2013 Letter which incorporate references to the

correct Bates Numbers.

of the attachments to the Claimant’s 7 June Letter.

“Respondent’s 10 July Letter”). In this letter, the Respondent provided its comments with
regard to ProEnergy’s financial interest in the outcome of the present arbitration proceeding;

Post-Hearing Submission”). The Respondent submitted its Post-Hearing Memorial on

in July 2013 the Minister of Finance and Attorney General issued to Parliament an ‘Information
Paper to assist Parliament on the modifications required under Article 181 of the Constitution’
(the “Information Paper”).” The Claimant inferred that “this Information Paper will evidence a
clear concern on the part of the Government and the Attorney General for the impact that the
Supreme Court’s decisions have had and request that in response the Parliament act to undo the
decisions of the Supreme Court that are relied upon by Ghana in these proceedings.” The
Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had “attempted to access this Information Paper for the
Tribunal’s reference, but [was] unsuccessful because the document [had] been marked as
‘secret’”. The Claimant requested that the Tribunal “order Ghana to produce the relevant

Information Paper subject, if necessary, to confidentiality and limited access of that document”.

By letter dated 28 August 2013, the Claimant affirmed that the Respondent had performed
“quite a serious departure from the instructions from the Tribunal with respect to the parties’
post-hearing brief regarding page limitations and formats”, entailing that the Respondent had
“enjoyed far more total pages of submission than that afforded to the Claimant.” By letter dated
29 August 2013, the Tribunal requested the Respondent to re-file the Respondent’s Post-

Hearing Submission, by 4 September 2013, in accordance to the formatting restrictions ordered

by the Tribunal in its letter dated 7 May 2013. By e-mail dated 3 September 2013, the Tribunal

invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimant's letter by 10 September 2013.

By letter dated 3 September 2013, the Respondent filed a new version of the Respondent's Po:
Hearing Submission with the amendments required by the Tribunal in its letter dated 29 August:

2013.

By letter dated 3 September 2013, the Respondent objected to “the introduction of several
hundred pages of new exhibits by [the Claimant] in its post-hearing submission”. According to
the Respondent, the Claimant had introduced new evidence concerning damages and its
corporate structure. The Respondent recailed the Tribunal’s order that “no new evidence was to
be included in the parties’ post-hearing submissions” as expressed both during the hearings and

in the Tribunal’s Order dated 7 May 2013. The Respondent requested “that the Tribunal strike |

the documents ... and direct that they not constitute part of the record of these proceedings”,
and that “the Tribunal disregard and or strike evidence from this documents that is cited in
Balkan’s Post-Hearing Closing Brief ... and that it order such other and further relief as the
Tribunal deems appropriate in the light of Balkan’s knowing violation of its Orders”. By e-mail

dated 5 September 2013, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to comment on the Respondent's

 

letter by 12 September 2013,

By letter dated 10 September 2013, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Claimant's

letter dated 26 August 2013.

By letter dated 12 September 2013, the Claimant submitted its comments on the Respondent's
letter dated 3 September 2013 regarding the alleged introduction of new evidence by the

Claimant and made observations on the Respondent's letter dated 10 September 2013.

By letter dated 16 September 2013, the Respondent submitted comments on the Claimant’s

letter dated 12 September 2013.

By letter dated 18 September 2013, the Tribunal reverted to the Parties jn respect of the matters
originating in their letters of 26 August 2013, 3 September 2013, as well as the Parties’
of 10 ber 2013, 12 2013 and 16 September 2013. First, the

Tribunal informed the Parties that the Claimant’s request for the production of the Information
Paper was denied. The Tribunal recalled that it had “made it clear that it is not willing to admit
any new evidence after the hearing”. The Tribunal stated that “[t]he same principle holds true, a

JSortiori, for evidence requested to be adduced after the Parties have submitted their post-hearing

submissions. Admitting any such evidence into the record would be inconsistent with the
orderly conduct of the arbitral proceedings and would compromise the right of defense of the

opposing Party.”

Second, the Tribunal decided not to take into consideration any new evidence pertaining to
damages that was submitted with the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Submission. The Tribunal
reiterated its ruling on the non-admissibility of new evidence and observed that “the Claimant
had ample opportunity to provide evidence in support of its damages calculation during the
course of the arbitration. Admitting such documents into the record would compromise the right

of defense of the opposing party.”

Third, the Tribunal decided to “consider the information provided by the Claimant in its June 7,
2013 submission [Claimant's 7 June Letter}” relating to its corporate structure. as had been
specifically requested by the Tribunal on 7 May 2013, but that it would not “have regard to any
new evidence adduced with the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Submission”. According to the
Tribunal, “such information was to be provided in a separate stage, well in advance of the post-
hearing submissions, so as to enable the opposing Party to comment on such information and
draw out its legal significance in its post-hearing submission.” In the Tribunal’s view,

“adherence to this process is essential to uphold the right of defense of the opposing Party.”

By letter dated 8 October 2013, the Tribunal noted that there were several incorrect cross-
references in paragraph 152 of the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Submission. The Tribunal requested
the Claimant “to provide the appropriate cross-references as a point of formal correction.” The
Tribunal stressed that “no further changes to the Post-Hearing Brief will be allowed or taken
into consideration.” By letter dated 10 October 2013, the Claimant provided the formal

corrections requested by the Tribunal.

Iv. STATEMENT OF FACTS
A. NEGOTIATION AND CONCLUSION OF THE PPA
L Undisputed Facts

89. In May 2007, Mr. Phillip Elders, visited Ghana in search of a business opportunity.“
Mr. Elders, an American citizen, has been the Chief Executive Officer of BEL and the Senior
Vice-President of Balkan US since 2007, prior to which he “worked for 12 years as an
engineering salesman with a specialty in power projects”. Since late 2006, Ghana had been.
experiencing a severe energy crisis due to drought and its reliance on hydropower for the

production of electricity.” As a result, Ghana’s power system was running at subpar reliability

 

reserve margins estimated to be in a 20% deficit of the projected demand.” As a step towards

 

addressing the crisis, Ghana engaged in negotiations with Balkan US in order to conclude an

agreement for Balkan to refurbish and recommission the Barge and Power Station. The

Statement of Claim, para. 58; Statement of Defense, para. 26; Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip
Elders, para. 8; In May 2007, the Claimant also submits that it first learned of the protections for foreign
investors provided by the Ghana Investment Promotion Center (“GIPC”), created in 1988 and which
provides both domestic and foreign investors with information on and access to investor registration
forms, start up procedures, a land bank database, and general and sector-specific laws and regulations (see
Statement of Claim, paras. 66, 30; Exhibit C-4: “Ghana Investment Promotion Centre Act, 1994 (ACT
478)"; Exhibit C-38, Attachment 224: “Index of GIPC documents”; see also Exhibit C-38, Attachments
225-231 and Exhibit C-35: Witness Statement of Gene Phillips, para. 13), According to the Claimant,
since late 2004, the GIPC has functioned as a “‘one-stop shop’ to eliminate some of the bureaucratic
obstacles investors face.” The Claimant asserts that the foreign investment protections seemingly fostered
by the GIPC “was a definite consideration in moving forward with an interest in opportunities in Ghana in

Claimant’s key contacts at Ghana’s Ministry of Energy were Mr. Max Gyamfi (Director of
Petroleum), Ms. Vivien Gadzekpo (Legal Counsel), and Mr. Gabriel Quain (Deputy Director of

Power).

On 2 May 2007, Mr. Elders conducted his first visit to the Barge to ascertain “whether the

primary equipment appeared to be in good shape.”

On or around 8 May 2007, Mr. Elders met with officials of Ghana’s Ministry of Energy. The
Claimant submits that the Ministry of Energy provided Mr. Elders with a report on the Barge
produced by its manufacturer Ansaldo Energia S.p.A. (“Ansaido”) “2-3 years earlier” (the

“2005 Ansaido Report”).”

 
 

On 10 May 2007, Mr. Elders, on behalf of Balkan US, submitted an expression of interest letter
to the Ministry of Energy of Ghana (the “Expression of Interest’), proposing to construct “a
fully functioning power plant including a fuel supply system and substation” and promising to
complete a technical proposal for the commissioning of the Barge.” In return, Mr. Elders
requested that Ghana’s Minister of Energy, the Honourable Mr. Joseph K. Adda, provide him

with a letter of intent, which the Minister did on 11 May 2004."

In furtherance of Balkan US’s negotiations with Ghana’s Ministry of Energy, on 12 May 2007,
Mr. Elders visited the Barge to inspect the site and establish the condition of the Power
Station.” The Claimant contends that “there were intensive discussions on the question of this
project” and that he specifically had “intensive discussions with representatives from the
(Ministry of Energy], and submitted several versions of a proposal for work on the Barge which

... also set out various questions that he had,’

this exchange, the Claimant submits that it engaged a local Ghanaian consultant, Mr. Nana
Amo, to assist Mr. Elders with his negotiations with the Ministry of Energy and Ghana’s Public

Utilities Regulatory Commission (the “PURC’).!

99. On 14 June 2007, Mr. Elders submitted a “Tariff Analysis Report” to the Ministry of Energy
and to the PURC.” On or around 21 June 2007, the Claimant received comments on its “draft
PPA”, (the Tribunal assumes that this is a reference to the Tariff Analysis Report from Ghana’s
Volta River Authority (the “VRA”))."* According to the Claimant, the VRA “was an important
stakeholder in this deal, given that it is the administrative body in charge of power
generation.”*”

100. At Mr. Eiders request, on 21 June 2007, the Ministry of Energy provided him with a letter of

intent (the “Letter of Intent”), which proposed a lower tariff rate for the Tolling Fees.

101. Other international companies were also being considered for the Barge project at the time.
These included AES Electric, Globeleq and Aldwych." According to the Claimant the Ministry
of Energy “pressed upon Elders the importance of a quick commissioning process for the
Balkan group to be a successful bidder”,”” and informed Mr. Elders that Globeleg was willing to
match any bid submitted by Balkan US.” For its part, the Respondent asserts that each of
Balkan US's competitors in the bidding process “had indicated that it would take a year or more

9992

to commission the Barge.”” The Respondent emphasises that Balkan US “was selected for the

project based on its representation, as set forth in the MOU, that it would operationalize the

any further until he could ‘authenticate’ the signature.””’ On 11 July 2007, Messrs. Elders and
Amo met with Ghana’s President at the time, Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, to discuss the recent
obstacle Balkan US had encountered in its discussions with the Ministry of Energy.”* According

Claimant submits that “as a testament to what was discussed in this meeting, the [Parties put

together an Understanding”!

Article 12 of Ghana’s Energy Commission Act, 1997 (Act 541) requires that all companies that
wish to obtain a license to supply bulk energy in Ghana must be incorporated in Ghana.'™ To
meet this requirement, on 16 July 2007, BEL was formed, with the agreement of the
Government of Ghana, and registered under Ghana’s Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179) as a

locally incorporated company."

On 20 July 2007, Mr, Elders met again with Ghana’s Minister for Energy and his staff, along
with several representatives from the VRA and PURC.' According to the Claimant,
Ms, Chinery-Hesse announced that Balkan US had agreed to take on the Barge project and that
the Ministry of Energy should make best efforts to execute the PPA as quickly as possible, as
due diligence had already been conducted and “PURC had confirmed that the deal was

commereial.”"”

On 23 July 2007, discussions with respect to the PPA commenced at the office of the Ministry
of Energy.’ In attendance were approximately 10 representatives from the Ministry of Energy,
the Attorney General’s Department, the VRA and its related entity “GRUDCo”.' According to

After examining the attached documents we are satisfied that .

company and as a result the PPA does not come under the ambit of Article 181(5) of the
1992 Constitution which stipulates that an international business or economic transaction to
which the Government is a party should be submitted to Parliament for approval. In the
Supreme Court case of Attorney General versus Faroe Atlantic Co. Ltd. (2005-2006) . . .
the Supreme Court held that international business or economic transaction means
international business or international economic transaction. This clearly excludes the
project hereof which involves a local company in a focal transaction with the Government.

 

In light of the above 4 Parliamentary approval would not be required for the effectiveness
of the Agreement."

Mr. Elders that, as per the conditions precedent in Article 7 of the PPA, Ghana had: issued a
legal opinion as to the validity, enforceability and binding effect of the PPA; issued to BEL a

113. The Parties agree that the Effective Date of the PPA was 31 October 2007.'"*

114. Under the PPA, the Parties agreed that, whereas Ghana had an urgent need for additional
electricity generation to meet its power supply deficiencies, BEL, bearing al! costs, estimated at
USD 40 million, would lease the Power Station from Ghana, and commission it. In particular,
pursuant to the PPA and the Milestone Schedule attached as the Third Schedule to the PPA,
BEL was obligated to have the Power Station ready for “Final Testing and Commissioning” ~

The Parties further agreed that BEL, bearing all costs, estimated at USD 100 million, would _
convert the Power Station into a combined cycle power plant by the addition of a heat recovery
steam generator with an incremental capacity of approximately sixty megawatts (60MW), a
steam turbine, an electric generator and associated facilities within nine (9) months of the

Effective Date of the PPA; that BEL, at an estimated cost of USD 250 to 300 million, would

approximately one hundred and eight-five megawatts (185 MW) each, to the site within thirty-

six (36) months of agreement on a tolling fee for the systems; that BEL would, subject to

satisfactory conclusion of supply agreements with other source providers and at an estimated.

cost of USD 100 million, invest in infrastructure to enable natural gas to be supplied to the

Under the PPA, the Parties also agreed that Ghana would ensure that all necessary site
electricity was provided, at BEL’s cost. and made available as reasonably required by BEL; that
Ghana would promptly facilitate the acquisition of governmental approvals for the duty-free
importation and transportation of equipment to the site, for operating permits, licenses and
approvals for the project, and for visas and work permits for foreign personnel and for full
compliance with all local and other regulations; that Ghana thereby guaranteed that BEL would
have the exclusive right to generate electricity from the site subject to meeting the agreed
timetable; that Ghana would facilitate the acquisition of all governmental approvals required for
the leasing, equipping and operation of the Power Station, including relevant environmental
permits from the Environmental Protection Agency; that Ghana would construct, install and
connect the transmission line and relay protection equipment necessary to connect the Power
Station to the National Grid, except that BEL would be responsible, at its own cost, for
provision of adequate transmission cables to the point of interconnection with Ghana’s national

Under the PPA, the Parties also agreed that they would mutually collaborate with each other in
order to achieve the objectives of the Agreement and the performance by each Party of its
obligations (a process referred to as “dovetailing” by the Claimant), and that Ghana would
provide full and timely cooperation in connection with BEL’s efforts to finance the Power

2. Disputed Facts
(a) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant asserts that after submitting its Proposal, Mr. Elders immediately sensed “some
reluctance on the part of the [Ministry of Energy] to hammer out an agreement”, followed by
“many unnecessary delays”.'“ The Claimant further states that the Ansaldo representatives
“indicated to Biders that if he were able to negotiate a PPA it would ‘be a miracle’."'
According to the Claimant, the “incorporation of BE[L] Ghana had at that time nothing
whatsoever to do with issues of the Ghanaian [C]onstitution or parliamentary approval but were
motivated entirely by Mr. KK Sey’s correct observation that in order to become licensed
pursuant to the applicable laws of Ghana governing power generation and transmission it was
necessary to have a license and that the statutes of Ghana required that that license might only
be obtained through a Ghanaian entity.”!° According to the Claimant BEL obtained the license
on 1 October 2007.)

The Claimant submits that Mr. Elders “does not recall being informed of having negotiations
with respect to potential constitutional requirements of parliamentary approval.” | The
Claimant further asserts that the Ministry of Energy was fully aware of Balkan US's interest in
BEL and the reasons for the incorporation of BEL in Ghana, and corresponding “final vesting of.

the PPA in that entity”

(b) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent alleges that throughout the Claimant’s Statement of Claim. it “repeatedly casts
aspersions upon the officials conducting the negotiations [of the PPA}, implying or inferring
some hidden motive that delayed the negotiations.” The Respondent denies these allegations.
lt asserts that “what separated the parties were the economics of Balkan’s proposal, not the
hidden motives of government officials."

The Respondent contends that none of the Claimant's representations in the MOU turned out to
be true. First, the Claimant represented that it was a private corporation duly organized and
existing under the Jaws of the Netherlands: however, it later came to light that the Claimant is
not in fact registered in the Netherlands. Second, the Claimant stated that it had “the experience
and capability of operating liguid/gas fired power plants”; however, the Claimant did not have
the experience and capability it claimed, particularly with respect to commissioning the

as
turbines.”

DESCRIPTION OF THE POWER STATION / BARGE

‘The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the detailed technical descriptions of the Power Station and

Barge as provided by the Parties. These descriptions have been the subject of much discussion 3

 

during this merits phase of the arbitration. The Tribunal will now address the technical aspects

 

of the commissioning process—particularly those that are in dispute between the Parties—to the

extent necessary for the present Award.

The Power Station is mounted on the Barge, which is Jocated in a large man-made pond in a
remote area of Ghana’s western region.’ Approximately 50 meters from the pond is “Tower
No. 1” of the spur grid that connects the Power Station to the two substations in the near-by
villages of Essiama and Elubo, namely, the “Essiama Transmission Line” and the “Eiubo

Transmission Line”, (collectively referred to as the “Transmission Lines”).'*

Built by Ansaldo, the Power Station consists of two V.64.3A turbines (“Turbine 1” and
“Turbine 2”, collectively the “Turbines”), each with its own generator,'* together with a
control substation (the “Substation”).'%° The Turbines and generators produce power at eleven
kilovolts (11 kV), which is then ‘stepped-up’ to one hundred and sixty-one kilovolts (161 kV)
by the transformers on the Substation.'*”

The Remote Terminal Unit (the “RTU”) is a piece of equipment on the Barge whose primary
function is to wansmit data to and from the Micro Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
System (the “MicroSCADA”) installed on the Barge. The RTU, MicroSCADA and the
Distribution Control System (the “DCS”) permit an operator in the control room on the Barge to

monitor and control equipment in the Substation.*

1. The Claimant’s Position

According to the Claimant, Ghana's National Interconnected Transmission System (the
“G-NITS”) is operated at one hundred and sixty-one kilovolts (161 kV) (the Tribunal assumes
that the term G-NITS used by the Claimant is the same as the 161 kV electrical system referred
to by the Respondent). The normal unit operator start-up for the Barge requires that both the
G-NITS and the Substation be energized to 161 kV, which subsequently energizes the 161 kV

transformers to bring power to both the open generator breaker and the auxiliary transformer.'“°

129. The Claimant asserts that final commissioning cannot be achieved without the final connection
to the G-NITS “because it is the source of power to start the combustion turbine, and also the

source of load to test the turbine during performance testing activities”.

2. The Respondent’s Position

 

130. The Substation is equipped with, inter alia, a one hundred and sixty-one kilovolt (161 kV)
electrical system, which includes the gantry, the 16! kV GIS switchgear, two main 161/11 kV
‘step-up’ transformers, the earthing/grounding system and the protection relays.” The function
of the 161 kV electrical system is to take power generated from the power-generation equipment
located on the Barge (including the Turbines and generator) and, in a controlled manner, allow
that power to pass onto the Transmission Lines connected to the Barge at the gantry."“* The
161 kV GIS switchgear controls both the export of electricity out to the Transmission Line and

the import of energy, if any is required, from the Transmission Lines to the Barge.'*

131. According to the Respondent, the 161 kV electrical system must be fully commissioned and
properly functioning before the Power Station can be connected to the National Grid. If it is not,

the transformers and the 16] kV GIS switchgear could face severe damage when fired up.'*

c. THE COMMISSIONING PROCESS

 

132. The Claimant contends that, in order to fully commission the Barge under the PPA, four major
“milestones” had to be achieved: (a) turning gear; (b) first fire; (c) full speed no load; and (d)
full speed fuil load.“ The Claimant submits that “the total power plant commissioning process
involves commissioning multiple minor and major systems to reach each major milestone,” as
well as synchronizing each system through the DCS." To explain its position, the Claimant

adopts the description of the commissioning phases provided by Mr. Elders in his witness

reference to the witness statements of Messrs. Robert MacDonald and Lonnie Peters.'*

 

To explain its position, the Respondent makes reference to the witness statement of Mr. Robert

© the Commissioning Book for the Tema Thermal Power Project'®’ (both of which

Badger,
were submitted with its Statement of Defense) and the Expert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff

(submitted with its Rejoinder).'! Pursuant to the witness statement of Mr. Badger, the five

 

necessary steps to commission the Turbines are: (a) pre-commissioning checks and tests; (b)
mechanical testing of the turbine-generator to full speed no load; (c) electrical testing of the

generator to full speed full load; (d) turbine-generator performance testing; and (e) declaration

 

of the commercial operation date. While not expressly incorporated into the Rejoinder itself, the
Tribunal has reviewed the Expert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, according to which the
commissioning of a barge requires the completion of eight steps, described in further detail a

below.’®

 

Jn its Reply, the Claimant objects to the Respondent’s characterization of the commissioning
process as set out in Mr. Badger’s witness statement. The Claimant asserts that “Mr. Badger’s
examples of the standard of conduct between an owner and a contractor with regard to
commissioning of a thermal power plant are inapplicable to the relationship between BE{L] and
the [Respondent] under the PPA” because “BE[L] was under no obligation and the

1, The Claimant’s Position
(a) Milestone I: Turning Gear

According to the Claimant, the first milestone, “Turning Gear”, entails getting the Turbines to
turn very slowly, at approximately one hundred and thirty to one hundred and fifty rotations per
minute (130-150 RPM) to test if they are working mechanically.'** The purpose of this step is to
allow the Turbine blades to cool down slowly, so as to “avoid warping, after they have been
soaked at full speed”! The cooling process can take up to 48 hours due to the temperatures
reached at full speed, thus “{e}lectricity from the grid is usually and customarily necessary for
these processes which require the Turbines to turn at a low RPM for longer periods of time.”!**
This step also tests whether all lubrication systems and fluid filtration systems are operating

correctly through the DCS.

(b) Milestone U: First Fire

At “First Fire”, the Static Frequency Converter (the “SFC”) speeds up the Turbines to
approximately two hundred rotations per minute (200 RPM) before they are ignited. 7
Accomplishing this milestone proves: that the ignition systems are sequencing properly; that the
natural gas system necessary for igniting the liquid fuel is fully operational; that the fuel to air
ratio is correct; that the damper system controlling fresh and return air is operating correctly;
and that the liquid fuel system can supply the necessary amounts of fuel, at the proper time, to
ignite the Turbines.'* After the Turbines reach speeds above one thousand eight-hundred
rotations per minute (1800 RPM), the SFC “drops out” and the Turbines are propelled by liquid

or natural gas combustion.”

{c) Milestone Ill: Full Speed No Load

in the Full Speed No Load (“FSNL”) phase, the Turbines are ignited to full speed —
approximately five thousand four hundred rotations per minute (5400 RPM) — this speed is

maintained, and then slowed down to a stop.’ According to the Claimant, “[tJbis is
internationally acknowledged as the most important milestone, as it indicates that all systems
are not only individuaily working but that the Power Station including all of these systems is

also able to function as a whole.”"*!

Achieving this milestone entails “tuning” the Turbines at
low speeds — less than one thousand five hundred rotations per minute (1500 RPM) ~ several
times per day and for long periods of time.’ The PPA allows for approximately thirty (30) days

of “tuning” to accomplish this final commissioning step.’

(d) Milestone I'V: Full Speed Full Load

The final milestone. Full Speed Full Load (“FSFL”), signals the completion of the

commissioning proc

 

ss, Whereby “the equipment is gradually loaded with back feed from the
National Grid, indicating that the systems can handle the load.”'™ According to the Claimant, “a

considerable amount of tuning is also required to finalize this process.”"°

2. The Respondent’s Position

According to the Respondent the Claimant’s “[Habelling [of FSNL] as a ‘milestone’... is a
clever misnomer.”" {t asserts that the ‘Milestones’ the Claimant must achieve under the PPA in
order to be entitled to payment are set forth in the Third Schedule to the PPA, and “[nJowhere in
that Schedule is [FSNL] listed as a Milestone."

 

The Respondent does not expressly set out its version of the commissioning process in its
entirety either in its Statement of Defense or in its Rejoinder, but it emphasizes instead that the
key ‘milestone’ the Claimant “was obligated to achieve under the PPA in order to earn Tolling
Fees was ‘Complete Final Testing and Commissioning’ of the Barge within 90 days of the
Effective Date (PPA Clause 11.4)”; or, “{allternatively, Balkan could demonstrate a right to

Tolling Fees under Clause 11.9 of the PPA if it could show that all of the systems on the Barge

were ready for Final Testing and Commissioning subject only to the installation of a

 

Transmission Line connecting the Barge to the National Grid.”'* In its Rejoinder, the
Respondent draws support for its assertion that the Claimant did not complete the

commissioning of certain systems (that it alleges could have been commissioned without

 

    

connecting to the National Grid) from the Expert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, which claims.

 

that the standard procedure for the commissioning process consists of the following eight steps:

The first stage is to carry out a thorough survey of all the equipment and prepare a full
assessment of equipment condition, availability of spares and the necessary skilled
personnel to install these replacements. From this survey Balkan should have produced a
very detailed (Level-3) schedule of the work required to repair, refurbish and commissi
the Power Station. [Footnote omitted}

   

 

The second stage of the process is to purchase, deliver and instal! all the identified items
i that required replacement and/or refurbishment. Once these have been installed, initial tests
L must be conducted, such as pressure tests in piping systems, resistance, continuity tests and
loop checks of the control circuits in electrical systems all of which are necessary before
anything can be energised. This wi ind the work in stages three and four below, can be
undertaken using any available medium or low voltage power supply. Because the Barge
was equipped with a Black Start Generator (“BSG”), the opportunity should be taken at this
stage to make it operational for the latter stages of commissioning and testing when larger
quantities of electrical energy will be required to rotate and accelerate a gas turbine.

        
 

    

 

The third stage of the process involves running plant auxiliaries, such as pumps and
control valves, to circulate the necessary fluids such as lubricating oil, fuel and cooling
water and checking that the designed flow rates and pressures ate being achieved. Once this
stage has been completed, and the plant parameters recorded, the gas turbine can be put
onto barring round to provide an assurance that the rotor blades are not causing a rub on the
stator that could indicate a bowed rotor on a turbine that has not been regularly rotated.

 

Also at this stage the plant controls, and the control logic, can be tested to prove that they

E can Start and stop the various auxiliary drives, and where there is duty and standby plant,

the auto changeover from duty to standby can be accomplished. The safety trips and alarms

for the plant distributed control system (“DCS") should also be proven and witnessed at

this stage. These test results are normally required by the plant insurers if a claim is needed,

in the case of the gas turbine it is particularly important to ensure that all the automatic
turbine safety trips are operational before a first fire is attempted.

Electrically. the generator static tests (tests with the generator stationary) can be completed,
and the if kV and 161 kV GIS switchgear functionally tested (in a de-energised state)
along with their associated protection systems. to ensure that they are fully operational and
that electrical safety is assured,

 

 

The fourth stage leads up to and includes first firing of the gas turbine and is significant as
this is the first time that the turbine is accelerated up to firing speed (but not full speed)
using the turbine control system, Particular care has to be taken with liquid fuelled turbines
to ensure that any unburned liquid fuel does not accumulate in the combustion chamber but
does drain into the false start fuel drain tank before the next start attempt. [Footnote
omitted]

The first fire commissioning milestone also indicates that the fuel supply and the pilot
ignition systems are both functioning. First fire is of necessity a short duration event to
prove the firing and rotational capability of the turbine and its starting system, that the
bearings remain cool and that there are no unexpected mechanical noises from the rotating

turbine to ig speed.

tic frequency conyerter (SFC) i
a starter motor to accelerate the }

  
 

The fifth stage: Once first firing is completed and any malfunctions corrected, the next
stage of commissioning entails accelerating the turbine to full speed no load (“FSNL”) and
maintaining this speed whilst @ number of checks are carried out on the combustion and
control performance and to allow the turbine to “heat soak”.'® Depending upon the turbine
type, PSNL requires around 25% of the full load fuel consumption as the gas turbine drives
its own compressor. Sustained FSNL is a necessary pre-requisite to prove the various
mechanical and electrical auxiliary systems and to allow dynamic testing to be completed
on the generator and the synchronizing equipment. As detailed below, in our opinion
Balkan never successfully achieved a recognized sustained FSNL milestone during the
commissioning process,

The sixth stage: If a BSG is available, this may now be used to start the Barge auxiliaries,
energise the static frequency converter, start the Gas Turbine (“GT”) and accelerate up to
FSNL. Once sustained FSNL is achieved, the GT generator should be dynamically
commissioned and tested, and when all is proven, the BSG and GT generator are
synchronized and the BSG is then shut down. [Footnote omitted]

 

7
\
'

 

   

 

The seventh stage: The GT generator may now be synchronized with the 161 kV
Transmission Line. At this point, Full Speed Fuéi Load (“FSFL”) commissioni
commences. This involves incrementally adding load to the GT generator until it is
operating at full Joad.

 

The eighth stage: Once full load operation is achieved on both GT generators, final
performance testing is conducted to prove that the power station is operating in accordance
with its design parameters and is ready for commercial operation.

D. ‘USE OF, AND UNITED STATES PROCEEDING AGAINST, SUBCONTRACTORS

Background to the United States proceedings

141. The Claimant employed several subcontractors on the Barge, including ProEnergy Services
LLC (“ProEnergy”), ABB Group (“ABB”) and Ansaldo,

142. Since many of the undisputed facts related to the commissioning work completed by the
Claimant, as well as the Respondent's factual assertions with regards to certain disputed facts,'”

are established by documents procured from the ProEnergy Litigation (infra), the Tribunal finds

it instructive, in setting out the Statement of Facts, to give a brief summary of the ProEnergy 3

Litigation.

   

143. In September 2007, the Claimant subcontracted ProEnergy to it in commissioning the

Power Station. Two legal proceedings were subsequently commenced between these parties:

1 Expert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, at 6, fn. 5: “As discussed below, there are internationally

recognized standards defining the parameters for FSNL. See e.g., R-51 at Clause 6.3.11 for guidance as to
turbine test requirements. Turbine manufacturers also have their own commissioning procedures.”

result of its negligence and incompetence, ProEnergy was not “even close” to commissioning

the Barge or completing its conimissioning work.’

145. Sometime thereafter, Ghana commenced proceedings against ProEnergy in the US District
Court to obtain documents regarding the work ProEnergy performed on the Power Station, as
well as documents relating to litigation filed against it by Balkan US.’ The Claimant
intervened in that proceeding to oppose Ghana's application for discovery, but the US District

2. Commissioning Steps Not Completed by the Claimant Allegedly Due to Inadequate
Site Electricity

(a) Undisputed Facts

152, While it is clear that the Claimant faced a number of challenges in the commissioning process
from late 2007 through to 2009, the reasons for these challenges are disputed by the Parties. In
particular, the Parties disagree as to whether the provision of inadequate site electricity by the

Respondent made commissioning more difficult or more costly.

153. On 3 September 2007, Mr. Elders agreed or certified that “electricity has been supplied at the
required Voltage and Frequency and is available for the express use of Balkan [...] in executing
[its] obligations in the (PPA]”.'**

154. To compensate for the alleged Jack of site electricity that ensued, the Claimant purchased and
rented various power generators sometime in 2007. On 17 November 2007, two such
generators, each having power capacity of 200 kVA, broke down and were replaced by new

ones of a different brand.'”

Mr. Elders questioned Mr. Robinson’s need for the additional generators, adding that “{t]his is a

total overkill. Your load for the barge is less than 500 amps."

(b) Disputed Facts

i. The Claimant's Position

Te states

The Claimant contends that it required a capacity of 2,000 kVa for site electricity.
that, as a result of the Respondent’s failure to make this amount of electricity available to the
Barge, it was obliged to purchase a 1,000 kVa wansformer costing USD 30,000 in March

2008."

The Claimant points out that the Respondent does not dispute the Claimant's assertion that the
33 kV line running from the local electricity distribution network to the Barge was not
operational in April or May 2008.'" But at the same time, the Claimant also states that it
rejected ProEnergy’s requests for additional generators in December 2007 precisely because
“Elders had recently been advised and, in fact verified that the 33 kV line had been connected

1195

and was operational.”

ii. The Respondent's Position

The Respondent alleges that the Claimant’s assertions as to the time when the 33 kV line
became operational are “factually incorrect.” Jn this regard the Respondent points to the
evidentiary record, which shows that Mr, Elders had verified and certified that the 33 kV line
was both operational and sufficient on 3 September 2007.'" Accordingly, the Respondent
reiterates that, on December 2007 when the Claimant admits it rejected ProEnergy’s request for
additional generators because the 33 kV line linking the local electricity distribution network to

inconsistent positions” in its Reply by first alleging that the 33 KV line was not operational until
May 2008, but then, in December 2007, asserting that it had indeed been connected and was

operational.'**

159. As will be discussed in greater detail below in addressing the Parties’ Arguments, the

 

Respondent asserts that the position originally taken by the Claimant in its Statement of Claim

“confusingly runs several concepts together”. In particular, the Claimant’s position:

() confused the capacity of the 33 kV line with the capacity of the transformer on
the Barge, (ii) was contrary to the position it took with ProEnergy in denying
ProEnergy’s requests for additional generators, (iii) was legally inconsistent with
{the Claimant's] claim in the ProEnergy Litigation that ProEnergy could and should
have completed the Power Station by March 2008, and (iv) at best, extended
Balkan’s time to complete the commissioning to October 2008."

 

160. On 17 June 2008, Mr. Elders and his team met with the Minister of Energy and his team, to

discuss the progress of the Project.” During this meeting, Mr. Elders made clear to the Minister

 

that while he had indeed certified that Ghana had provided site electricity to the Barge on 4 May

 

2008, on 5 May 2008 the power went out five times, Similar power outages continued to occur

thereafter, normally in the early hours of the morning. In particular, Mr. Elders complained that

 

there was no way that the existing 200 kVa transformer could meet the Barge’s power needs,
since at least 1,000 amps of power was required at any one time - an amount of power which
the 200 kVa transformer could not support. Mr. Elders further advised the Minister that Balkan
was spending over USD 4,000 on extra generators to provide sufficient site electricity to
continue their commissioning efforts on the Barge. The video recording of this meeting shows

that the Minister agreed to provide more reliable site electricity.

£

161.

Notwithstanding Ansajdo’s initial reports certifying to the contrary (infra), il appears to be
undisputed between the Parties that the Claimant was never able to achieve mechanical testing

of the Turbines at FSNL-

 

162. In ProEnergy’s daily report dated 5 to 15 June to BEL, it deseribed the status of the turbines as

follows, in the relevant part:

Mechanical Work Performed Today:

i. Train 1 and 2 turbine, gearbox and generator exhaust fans, dampers and
Jouvers require replacement because of severe corrosion [...].

. WEATHER REPORT: As we are in the rainy season, it tends to rain
almost every day: not your nommal rain; tropical down pours that clearly
show you what roofs leak and which ones do not. We have a major issue
on the barge with every single roo{f] that we have: we leak water into the
gas turbine enclosures, both units [...].°°"

 

 

163. In its next daily report to BEL for the period 16 June to 6 July 2008, ProEnergy described the

condition of the Turbines as follows, in relevant part:

OSJUNO8

We managed to manually first fire Unit 1 on Saturday; ignition gas valves, ignitors and LF
fuel injection control valves were manually manipulated. The unit responded fairly well
with the exception of catching on fire as we has {sie] a lot of liquid fuel in the turbine that
we had rinsed with water but collected in various places inside and outside the turbine; we
did not experience any damage as we have a trained fire fighting brigade. The DCS logic is
simply not complete and I do not have a clue as to how Ansaldo fired this unit as they have
told me; as I have stated before, J will testify that these units have never fired simply
because nothing works.

LJ
10. DCS: DCS Logic is a Farce; Ansaldo has repeatedly told me that this barge has first
fired both gas turbines; I do not believe this and can prove it in a court of law; 10% of the

automated logic is functional and that is being very nice, most of the logic does not work,
even when all conditions are satisfied. Site personal [sic] including Eric Wolters of Ansaldo

BEL wrote to the Ministry of Energy on 2 September 2008, asking it to confirm that it wanted

to go ahead with operating the Barge on liquid fuel, even though the costs would be extremely

 

high." In that regard, BEL confirmed “its readiness to start its first power generation starting

on 1“ November, 2008” and advised that it needed “to confirm [its] high grade fuel supply,
storage and site delivery schedules to enable [it to] go commercial on [the] scheduled date”?!
BEL further stated that, due to the unavailability of high grade diesel fuel for power production
on the local market, it had been forced to test run the barge on lower volumes of jet fuel, which
is even more expensive."? BEL thereby advised the Ministry that they should “do everything
possible to get natural gas to the barge as soon as possible.”

In its daily report to BEL for the period 30 August to 5 September 2008, ProEnergy provided

the following status updates with regard to the firing of Turbine 1:

August 31, 2008

d. Unit | fired and run up to 4000rpm. The unit tripped on over speed protection.
Grounding of speed sensors to isolated ground carried out.

Conclusion:

The speed sensors are preventing further progress on Unit 1 {...J.2"

168. In its daily report to BEL for the period 20-26 September 2008, ProEnergy reported the

following with respect to Turbine 1:

g. Start Unit |, unit trip on “flame failure”. Investigated failure and found flame scanner
lens coasted with soot, Cleaned and replaced lens.

bh. Restart Unit 1, at 1800RPM the SFC tripped “max amps on bridge rectifier”. Reset

i. Restart Unit | again and same trip on SFC occurred. Attempt to contact Ansaldo SFC
engineer, No response.

t

September 24, 2008

e, Attempt to fire Unit 1, continuous trips related to fuel valve. The new HSS cards (Not

Ansaldo Issue) were installed after wiring modifications were carried out. We reverted

back to the old cards and wiring configurations and will carry out testing on the fuel

valves. It would seem that the new HSS cards need to be programmed by Ansaido.

f. Daring continuity checks between the GIS and synchronization panels we have found

that GIS |} wiring goes to Sync panel 2 and GIS 2 wiring goes to Syne panel] 1. Syne

panel i is connected to the DCS. In essence we have no DCS to GIS | for Unit 1. This is

an original wiring configuration from Ansaldo, We are currently looking at the best

course of action to go forward

fd

Conclusion:

 

The new HSS cards have been received on site; however we have not been able to check
their functionality as we have encountered various other problems on the unit {1 Turbine}.
The fuel oil shuts off valves started responding intermittently, some of the solenoids had
failed; we had sufficient spares on site to correct the problem. The SFC has started
tripping on various causes; we have investigated the BSDG as that seemed to be the
source of the problem. We are unable to access the SFC program to enable further trouble
shooting. Balkan Energy should consider the return of Ansaldo controls engineer and
eg Ansaiso [sic] SFC engineer [...}.

e. Open combustion chamber and carry out a nozzle inspection. The nozzles appear to
be in a good state. However the I stage turbine blades have sustained damage and
would need to be changed out. This unit can no longer be fired under current
condition, the damage sustained by the unit can only deteriorate further.

 

170. On 9 July 2009, Ansaldo certified in the following terms that both Turbines had reached FSNL:

This letter is to certify that the two Gas Turbines (V64.3A) located on the Osagyefo Power
Barge have successfully completed the milestone of Ful) Speed No Load (FSNL). This
accomplishment was reached without electrical grid connectivity.

 

‘The two turbines have reached this milestone under the supervision and witnessing of
Ansaldo Energia, the Equipment Manufacturer of these units,

Properly designed electrical grid connectivity is mandatory to finalize any further
commissioning milestones.”

  

171. On 2 October 2009, Mr. Savio from Ansaldo submitted a Memorandum of Understanding to
Ghana’s Ministry of Energy,” which commented on the state of the Turbines as follows, in

relevant part:

Certification: Both parties certify that the two V64.3A Ansaido Turbines have
accomplished the milestone of Ful] Speed No Load. This accomplishment was certified in
writing by Ansaldo Energia S.p.A to Balkan Energy (Ghana) Limited on July 9, 2009. This
milestone was made possible only by the direct supervision and work performance of
Ansaldo Energia S.p.A. The final commissioning can only be completed when electrical
grid connectivity and energization is provided.

4. Complete final commissioning with full speed full load for natural gas operation.”

  
 

172. On 30 July 2030, Ansaldo wrote to the Ministry of Energy, putting its certification of the

' Turbines at FSNL in context. The relevant part of the letter reads as follows:

3. We take the occasion to remark that 2 years ago BE[L] ordered AEN to perform
: whatever activity needed until FSNL was reached on both GT units and nothing else,

highlighting that fact that, from a technical point of view, the FSNL condition is only but a

first step in the much longer process of other necessary activities to be undertaken like the

actual refurbishment up to real operational readiness of the Osagyefo Barge Power Plant.
4 Among others, but not limited to: Control systems TCS and AVR elements replacement,
cabinets and cabling completion and testing: generators complete inspection and tests
without and with load. GT’s TMR needed implementation; full auxiliaries functional
checks and complete final units recommissioning among the unavoidable major steps yet
to be performed, before Full Speed Full Load conditions can be reached.

 

  

 

We are very sory about the misleading verbal information given by Ansaldo Energia Sates
Engineer during the meetings held last year and this year in Your premises. We confirm all
needed internal actions have been taken at his regards, informing that all future desirable
relationships will be kept by another qualified AEN sales engineer.

The same wrong information received from the Ansaldo Sales Engineer lead also our
Country Representative Mr. Henri JM Wientjes to equivocal conclusions, unfortunately
slowing all progress on the matter of the barge recovery.7!*

ii, Disputed Facts
The Claimant's Position

173. In its Statement of Claim, the Claimant initially alleged that it attained FSNL on both turbines
on 30 June 2009." The Claimant explained that “{hJaving realized that no grid energization
was to be expected anytime soon, Elders decided to wy and see how far BEL would get in

reaching their next milestone [FSNL] with mimicking [sic] grid connectivity”; with “the added

   

challenge of having to mimick [sic] back feed with site electricity”
174. However, in its Reply, the Claimant concedes that it did not in fact achieve mechanical testing
of the turbines at FSNL-

The Claimant also argues that Ansaldo had recommended against the use of the “Black Start
Generator” for commissioning, and that the Claimant was entitled to rely on the
manufacturer's advice.** In its letter to BEL dated 13 January 2009, Ansaldo advised as

follows, in the relevant part:

 

Commissioning activities using the Black Start Generator ~ The Black Start Generator is
not utilized to perform activities of Jong duration like commissioning. There are significant
ifficulties and risks associated with ing to ission the power plan with the

Start generator. Therefore, it is preferable that Grid Connectivity be utilized for the
ant

 

blac!
entire commissioning process,

 

 

The Respondent's Position

176.

 

The Respondent counters that grid connectivity only becomes “an essential and necessary
condition of the commissioning process ... when a Transmission Line is required to provide
sufficient Load on the turbines so that they can be tested through FSFL”.” Alternatively, the
Respondent submits that the Claimant could have used the Black Start Generator on the Barge
to achieve mechanical testing of the turbines at FSNL ~ a procedure which ProEnergy described
in a memorandum to the Claimant.” The Respondent finds further support in the expert

testimony of Mr. Fainhurst, who testified that he had personally performed FSNL tests on

 

turbines without grid connectivity using a Black Start Generator

The Respondent asserts that the Turbines “were in a complete state of disrepair in August 2008
when the Essiama Transmission Lines were energized.’ The Respondent refers to several
exchanges between the Claimant and ProBnergy, obtained in the discovery of documents from
the ProEnergy proceedings, which show that there were problems with the DCS logic, including
fuel injection, piping and wiring which prevented the Turbines from achieving FSNL.”” In

particular, the Respondent emphasizes that, by the Claimant’s own admission, ProEnergy

irreparably damaged the rotor blades of Turbine 2 in October 2008 when it unsuccessfully

sought “over a hundred times” to start the generator.”

(b) The Condition of the Essiama and Elubo Transmission Lines Prior to Being
energised on 8 August and 13 November 2008, Respectively

  

178. As it appears from the Parties’ explanation at the Hearing, there are three connection points on

the Barge to the 161 kVa GIS: a first bay that connects to the Essiama substation, a second bay

 

that connects to the EJubo substation and a third bay that “was for future work”. Each bay could
be operated in isolation or in combination with each other, depending on the route through

which power should be evacuated"!

179.

Ss

Currently, the Elubo substation is not able to receive back-feed from the Barge. It needs to be

energised through the Essiama line. which extends to Tower 3. The Claimant's position is that

 

the Essiama substation could not take the full load from the Barge, and that Ghana had to

222

energise the Elubo Transmission Line as well.” The Respondent contends that the Essiama line

 

 

alone suffices to power the Barge.

i. Undisputed Facts

180. it is undisputed between the Parties that BEL complained to Ghana about “regular and dense
tree overgrowth of the [Transmission] lines all along the route”, noting that such overgrowth
“would cause short circuiting to appear as soon as the transmission line would be charged with

On 27 November 2007, Mr, Elders wrote to the then Minister of Energy, Mr. Adda, reporting
the Claimant’s concerns about the “jungle overgrowth on the transmission lines and the work
required on the two regional stations.”?*

Having received no response from the Respondent, Mr. Elders again wrote to the Ministry of
Energy on 17 December 2007, suggesting that the Respondent “focus on one of the two regional
stations, the one at Elubo, first ... [because] it seemed designed for the full capacity of the
Power Station and could thus, if necessary, operate on its own.”

On 4 April 2008, a site visit of the Barge was conducted by the Respondent, at which time the

Claimant asserts Mr. Elders “brought up the other matter that was slowing down the reliable and

 

adequate national grid connectivity: tree growth on the transmission lines.

On 28 July 2008, the Respondent advised the Claimant in writing that it would soon energise
the Ei

National Grid using this tine.”*

On 29 July 2008, the Claimant responded to this notification with a series of concerns that it

claimed would prevent the Essiama Transmission Line from being energised.”

On 12 August 2008, the Respondent wrote back to the Claimant, indicating that its concerns had
been addressed and that it saw no obstacle to energizing the Essiama Transmission Line?

On 8 August 2008, the Respondent energised the Essiama Transmission Line to Tower 3 (the
tower just outside the Project Site) and informed the Claimant that it was ready to connect the

241

Barge to the National Grid.’ The Essiama Transmission Line has a capacity of 365 MVA,

refers to Mr. Osafo’s testimony, which affirmed that, at the dates referred to, the Elubo line was
energised but was not ready.**” Mr. Osafo’s testimony made reference to the logs produced at

the time, which suggest that the attempted energization resulted in a general fault in the line.*"*

Also, there is a suggestion in the Claimant's pleadings that it had somehow documented that,
even after the Essiama Transmission Line was energised in August 2008, it was unreliable and
frequently could not carry the requisite energy to power the Barge, notwithstanding its

purported capacity of 365 MVA. However, the Tribunal is unable to find any Barge status

reports or other express documentation to that effect. In ils Post-Hearing Submission,” the

Claimant makes reference to the pictures and report of inspection of the Essiama substation

conducted by Mr. Robinson, which suggest that the Essiama substation required equipment

would have had to coordinate relay protection,” which it argues was never completed.

The Claimant further argues that “it is clear when viewed in the context of the timeline and the
meetings and agreements between the parties, that Mr. Wiafe [the Chief Executive Officer of
GRIDCo] instructed Isaac Nyantakyi [Technical Manager at the VRA] to energise the lines
despite the recognized deficiencies in the transmission lines and transmission towers in order to
claim that the Government had complied with its obligations under paragraph 3.3 of the
PPA. The Claimant also contends that “[wlorks on the power plant, transmission line and

substations to evacuate power from the power plant are still in progress” today.

Respondent’s Position

Jn reply to the Claimant’s contentions, the Respondent points out that the Essiama and Elubo
Transmission Lines were energised on 8 August and 13 November 2008, respectively.
However, BEL “could not have connected the Power Station to either the Essiama or Elubo
Transmission Lines when they were energised because BEL had yet to complete the 161 kV

electrical system on the Barge.”

4. The RTU / MicroSCADA**

The Parties’ diverging factual assertions and associated arguments raise the following factual
questions for the Tribunal’s determination: (a) who had the responsibility to commission the
RTU / MicroSCADA?; and (b) is the RTU / MicroSCADA necessary for the Claimant to

connect to the National Grid and complete the commissioning process?

I i. Undisputed Facts Related to Whether the Claimant Assumed Responsibility
to Commission the RTU

 

195. According to an internal e-mail dated 28 April 2008,**” Mr. Elders stated that “[tJhe challenge
is to find an organization that can help us get the [RTU / MicroSCADA] system upgraded
without utilizing Ansaldo and ABB ... Unfortunately, Ansaldo and ABB are so busy that they

 

 

don’t have [BEL] as a priority.”? In this search ProBnergy, as the Claimant’s contractor, a

sought proposals from various third parties to commission the RTU on the Barge.”

 

196. On 29 May 2008, the Claimant, through ProEnergy. obtained a proposal from ABB to upgrade

the existing RTU on the Barge.”
197. On 13 June 2008, Mr. Scott Kinney, owner of ProEnergy, solicited from Mr. J.D. Robinson, the
manager at Taurus Power & Controls Inc. (“Taurus”) at that time, a proposal to commission the

RTU." It appears that Taurus was contacted by ProBnergy without coordination with BEL.

198. At the meeting held on 17 June 2008, discussions between the Parties resulted in an agreement
between them on a grid connection process for the Barge (the “Grid Connection Process
Agreement”), * whereby the Respondent was to use its contacts with ABB to request a
proposal from ABB, on the understanding that BEL would pay for the costs of commissioning

charged by ABB.

199. On 2 July 2008, Taurus e-mailed to ProEnergy its evaluation of the RTU on the Barge, together

a vas «263
with its commissioning options.”

On 7 July 2008, Taurus advised ProEnergy and the Claimant that the Barge had “an existing old
RTU200 system from ABB that is obsolete and all the software has been lost”, Taurus promised

that it would submit a quote to replace the RTU."™

On 11 July 2008, Taurus presented its proposal (and quote) to replace the existing RTU /

ii. Disputed Facts on Whether the Claimant Assumed Responsibility for
Commissioning the RTU

The Claimant's Position

207.

209.

 

274

In its Reply, the Claimant explains that it only solicited proposals from various third parties to
commission the RTU so as to “apprise {itself] of the breadth and scope of the necessary
commissioning work” so that the work could be “coordinate[d]”, or “dovetaile{d]”, with the

Respondent.”

The Claimant states that the Respondent's assertion that BEL avoided employing Ansaldo or
ABB to install and commission the RTU is “incorrect” and that, “[iJndeed ABB and/or its
vendors or subcontractors provided numerous works and commissioning of their components on.

the [BJarge both before and after May 2008."

 

According to the Claimant, the Grid Connection Process Agreement (signed by the Parties on
17 June 2008) was the “first exchange” between the Parties with respect to the installation and
commissioning of the RTU / MicroSCADA and “clearly” provides that the Respondent's
contractors, Forclum and Norlec, and not BEL, were responsible for installing and
commissioning a new MicroSCADA system.?” The Claimant further contends that the Grid
Connection Process Agreement states that Norlec will carry out all “work with respect to the
power line carrier including but not limited to: 1) line waps; 2) CVTs; and 3) the ‘new ABB
SCADA system’. Again, on the [B]atge this unit was the RTU / MicroSCADA functions”.

. The Claimant submits that the law of Ghana places the obligation to commission the RTU on

the Government, through GridCo, as a NITS operator. Even if the Grid Code was not finally
promulgated until October 2009, that is, two years after the conclusion of the PPA, the Claimant
contends that the existing law and pradent industry practice existing in Ghana al the time of the
conclusion of the contract show that the Respondent was responsible for the RTU.?” The
Claimant argues that the 2007 version of the Grid Code was the final version that was circulated
and applied, because unlike the April version it was not entitled “draft” and also because
regulation 3 of LI 1937, passed on 5 June 2008, was drafted on the basis of the said Grid

2
Code."

Respondent's Position

The Respondent asserts that the Claimant always recognized that installing and commissioning
the RTU on the Barge was its responsibility.”"! From December 2007 — when it assumed control
of the Barge ~ to April 2008, the Claimant unsuccessfully sought to find a sub-contractor other

282 3

than ABB or Ansaldo to install and commission the RTU.™ For instance, in December 2007,
the Claimant sought and obtained a site survey report from ABB regarding the status and
condition of various ABB systems on the Barge. including the original RTU that ABB had

installed on the Barge when it was first delivered to Ghana.”

The Respondent rejects the
Claimant's assertion that it was merely apprising itself of the necessary commissioning work to
be done on the RTU so that il could divide the work between itself and the Respondent. The
Respondent asserts that the Claimant “never forwarded any of the proposals to the Government.
Instead, what the evidence shows that after ProEnergy solicited these proposals, it sought to
commence the installation of the RTU through Taurus.”

The Respondent further challenges the Claimant's reliance on Ghana's National Electricity

Code, which the Respondent notes was not adopted until October 2009 — well after the events at

The Claimant contends that, by October 2008, it became concerned that the Respondent “was
attempting to ‘offload’ its obligations and responsibilities with respect to commissioning of the
SCADA system and the RTU Micro/SCADA” based upon the correspondence between the
VRA, ABB, Forclum and Norlec (the Respondent’s contractors). The Claimant states that
“BE[L] volunteered to help with the costs of commissioning and to assist in defining an
appropriate bid proposal in concert with their efforts to obtain the work through their
contractors Forelum, Norlec and ABB.”?** However, the Claimant maintains that it never agreed
that commissioning the RTU was within its scope of work." Moreover, it contends that “all of
the preliminary correspondence and communications with respect to the proposals were
generated vis-i-vis communications between Isaac [Nyantakyi of the VRA] and representatives
of Norlec{,] Forclum and ABB[,] and not BE[L].’*™ Specifically, the Claimant makes reference

(b) Is the RTU / MicroSCADA Necessary for the Claimant to Connect to the

Parties also disagree as to whether such a system was technically required to complete the

commissioning process.

failed to install the RTU and that, without it, the main control center lies 250 km from the

 

Barge”

maintained by GRIDCo and VRA.”*° However, the Claimant then contends that “the
Government fails entirely to note the importance and significance of these systems [referring to
the RTU / MicroSCADA] for relay protection." The Claimant argues that the Respondent
mischaracterizes the equipment on the Barge in its submissions and, in particular, “fail{s] to
acknowledge that the RTU/MicroSCADA is an integral component of the overal] operations of

307

the (BJarge as it relates to its connection to the [National Grid} and that it must be coordinated

with telecommunications and relay protection in order to identify the scope associated with the

shared milestone”.

ii, The Respondent's Position

The Respondent contends that the Claimant “makes a number of misstatements about the

function of the RTU and unrelated work on the grid”.
While the Respondent acknowledges that “it would be preferable to have the RTU in place for
the commissioning, it states that it is not essential.”""® The Respondent asserts that the Claimant
could have connected to the National Grid and operated the 161 kV GIS switchgear on the

Barge from the local contro! cubicles on the Substation.*!!

According to the Respondent, the RTU allows the Power Station operator (the Claimant) to
remotely monitor and control the 161 kV electrical system on the Barge and to remotely control

its 161 kV circuit breakers from the main control room on the Barge.’ For the RTU to do its

job, a functioning 161 kV electrical system must be in place: otherwise, “there is no electrical
system for Balkan to remotely operate from the Main Control Room on the Barge and no
information regarding the electrical system to be sent to [the GRIDCo Control Centre in]

Tema”.

224. The Respondent reiterates its assertion that the Claimant was still performing work on the

 

161 kV electrical system when the Essiama Transmission Line was energised on 8 August 2008,
as well as when the Elubo Transmission Line was energised on 13 November 2008.**
According to the Respondent, “until the 161 kV electrical system on the Barge was operational,
there was no function for the RTU to perform”;*"* thus, prior to October 2008, commissioning
the RTU was a “non-issue” for all practical purposes." Moreover, if, after October 2008 (the
Effective Date of the PPA), the Claimant had completed its commissioning of the 161 kV
electrical system, the Respondent submits that the Claynant could then have connected the
Barge to the National Grid to complete the commissioning, irrespective of whether or not the

RTU was in place”

225. On 28 July 2008, the Respondent wrote to the Claimant to confirm that the Essiama
Transmission Line was ready to be energised.* The Respondent requested that its “nominated
representatives witness and sign off all the commissioning tests of the 161 kV equipment and

protection relays,” or “[iJn the event that the commissioning tests had already been done ... that
{the Claimant} forward the test results for [the Respondent's] review.”>”? The Claimant did not

respond to the Respondent’s request for the 161 KV commissioning tests.

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 85 of 264

In October 2008, the Claimant informed the Respondent that the Power Station would be ready
for Final Testing and Commissioning as of 28 October 2008 and ready to start generating power
on 1 November 2008." The Claimant informed the Respondent that all that remained to be
done was to connect the Transmission Line from the National Grid to the Power Station in order
to (a) run final tests of all systems prior to commissioning, and (b) off-take power from the

Barge onto the National Grid."
On 21 November 2008. the Respondent conducted a site visit to the Barge."

It appears that work on the 161 k¥ electrical system on the Barge continued through June

2009."

The following are Balkan US's allegations against ProEnergy in the ProEnergy Litigation with
respect to certain failures to perform under the terms of the contract, as excerpted in the

Statement of Defense:

230. In the context of the ProEnergy Litigation, a variety of e-mail exchanges, the existence or
authenticity of which are not disputed between the Parties, were uncovered. These exchanges
took place in 2008 between representatives of BEL and ProEnergy. They are restated in the

326

following as quoted by the Respondent:*

(i) E-mail exchange of February 1, 2008 between J.D. Robinson (the on-site ProEnergy
Project Manager) and Phil Elders of Balkan regarding Batkan’s failure to procure materials
on time and ProEnergy’s failure to commission the Barge within 90 working days.”

J.D. Robinson:

I’ve attached the material tracking source document; we have spent a lot of time getting this
document updated: how long do we wait for the Accra office to respond before we out
source to Bob? You keep pushing for }OMARO8 [the Completion Date under the PPA}; we
have to have 100% procurement support to meet any schedule or deadline. . .

To which Elders responds:

 

Don’t give me these weak excuses for not making March 10. Excuses, excuses, . . tit
was hotel, then food, then mosquitos, then snakes, and on and on, You need to overcome
the poor performance of Pro Energy's promises and start and get the job done.

Let's find a reason why and how you and your team can meet a milestone. .. .

Stay focussed and get the job done. There has been way too much talk and emails and
words. It’s way past time to do something significant. Otherwise, your just an average Joe
marking time and blaming life on other people.

To which Robinson replies:

 

Pro Energy Services has not performed poorly at any level on the Osagyefo Power Barge
Project; on the contrary; if you'll take note of the attached documents; you can clearly see

as performed poorly and it is certainly not Pro Energy Services. A successful project
cessful if all participants have the same common goal; a successful project needs
accurate and responsive material supply chain, especially in a third world country: and
jast but certainty not least, a project like this one needs proper and responsive funding when
requested. You have not fulfilled any of the project requirements. . ..

    

 

Gi) Another example from April 2008 discussing procurement problems and project
delay

4D. Robinson:

  

Lhave tried for several months to reiterate the critical nature of a stream lined supply chain
to facilitate our schedule of first firing Unit |: to date, our supply chaii
request to receipt of purchase order. our wire transfer request to positive confirmation of
receipt of wire to specific vendor is sub standard and continues to impact the project. One
example; Ansaldo has not been paid the Euro 57,500.00 that was sent in to Balkan on
27Feb08 . .

       

(iii) On August 10, 2008, another in a series of these e-mails between the onsite ProEnergy
Manager and Elders regarding Balkan’s slow payment of invoices and their impact on the
schedule:

J.D. Robinson:

Yes, I’m back; please explain what your message means, does it mean that I will receive
the PO on Monday or will it be like all of the other PO's and payments that are made out of
the Balkan office in Ghana. I have been trying to get Sud Chemie paid for over five weeks;
T have been trying to get Alpha Standard paid for over five weeks and there are other simple
examples. This is Project Execution and it is not being performed at any level of normality
for this type of project.

To which Elders responds:

Stop your crap! I am tired of seeing these crappy emails. T have a long long long list of crap
I could publicize on Pro Energy total failure and incompetence and you know what I mean.
Especially having the premix and diffusion piping wrongly piped for more than a month
while you and others tried futilly to make that crap work. . . now that is total incompetence
that has cost us untold amounts of money.

So cool your heals {sic] and get this thing started and stop the blasting on emails.*”

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 88 of 264

The saga here continues:

After changing out fuel supplies we had to rerun the return line as well. Attempted to fire
the unit 3 times, 3 trips{.] After tripping we had serious fire inside of the turbine +/- 900
deg C. Tomorrow Phil’s motley crew is going to start the stripdown on the BSDG (god help
them),

I continue to advise the client regarding my concerns and he continuously ignores my
advise. Today I have strongly advised against the stripping of the BSDG and have also
advised that Balkan Need a Combustion Engineer on site as soon as possible.

wk

  

We also require Saft back on site. You know the situation here “Balkan Policy, ....
have repeatedly mentioned this to Elders, to date nothing has happenned. Tim paid a visit to
Ansaldo, guess what, They want cash on the table before they will entertain any further
discussions regarding the barge.

(vy) E-mail of May 21, 2008 from J.D. Robinson”

About two months ago. while Phil Elders was at site, one of our transfer switches blew up
and caught fire: root cause analysis revealed that loose connections were the cause and Phil
Elders was involved in this process as he tries .... with every body while he is on site. Louis
and Phil got into a huge argument of this fact; the wires were loose as I checked them
myself. The issue went away: last week, we were changing these same cables to replace the
wiring to ensure we have reliability; well, here's where the story really begins; when they
installed the new transfer switch for the one that blew up, they wired completely wrong;
this was fine as they wired the two inputs and the one output wrong so, all worked fine.
When they rewired it the second time, they wired one of the inputs per the diagram and left
the other input and output wired wrong. So, when they energized the switch, it applied 400
VAC between neutral and Phase A; you cannot imagine the damage that occurred in less
than 3 seconds; every laptop power supply. every printer, seven televisions and all kinds of
various electrical and electronic equipment blew up.

 

    

(vi) Reflecting ProEnergy’s frustration with getting the Turbines up to first fire and the lack
of adequate documentation to achieve Full Speed No Load, Robinson wrote the
manufacturer, Ansaldo, on June 11, 2008:

T have been assured by persons in Italy and in Ghana that the gas turbines on this barge
were fire and brought to FSNL. Having lived with this machine for the last six months of
my life and having personally inspected every single component on the barge including the
combustion chambers and fuel nozzles of the turbines, [ fully believe, based on my
experience, that these machines have never been fired or if they were, it was for less than
10 seconds, SMOKE OUT OF THE STACK! My position is also supported by the lack of
functional logic for critical areas of the barge; one in particular is the LF Injection Skid
Bypass Control Valves. Carlo, you are somewhat aware of some of the issues that we have
encountered, the software and wiring were setup for LVDT and yet we have 4 to 20 made
transducers: the list goes on and on... .

I would really appreciate some immediate feedback on my problem as I’m taking a lot of
crap from this client about the lack of information flow between site and Ansaldo and at 4
this point in time, I cannot defend myself. I need to talk with the GURU about how this j

machines is supposed to work during a start cycle and I need documents clearly define
startup and FSNL Sequence. i

(vil) Then, on June 16, 2008, ProBnergy wrote the following progress report regarding its |
attempt to first fire Unit 1:>

We managed to manually first fire Unit | on Saturday: ignition gas valves, ignitors and LF
Fuel injection control valves were manually manipulated, The unit responded fairly well
with the exception of catching on fire as we has a lot of liquid fuel in the turbine that we
had rinsed with water but collected in various places inside and outside of the turbine; we
did not experience any damage as we have a trained fire fighting brigade. The DCS logic is
simply not complete and I do not have a clue as to how Ansaldo fired this unit as they have
told me; as I have stated before. will testify that these units have never fired simply
because nothing works,

 

(viii) On August 10, 2008, ProBnergy wrote Ansaldo:*”

Let me say with everything that we are finding, including speed pickups, flame
scanner failures, LF Fuel Injection problems, HSS Module problems, TSA Modules
problems and so on and so on; I maintain my account that this machine never fired.

 

Gx) And on August 12, 2008, one of the subcontractors on the site, Scott Kinney from
Taurus Power, wrote in part:***

Now I hear that [Phil Elders] is blaming ProEnergy for finding a problem that was hurting
the project. All we have been doing for the last six weeks is to find problems. Whether it is
corroded fittings, bad speed probes, failed HSS cards, everyday there are new problems. I
suppose that Phil could blame every single problem on ProEnergy and why you don’t know
exactly what is wrong before it actually fails.

 
   

 

T also don’t appreciate his using my name as any part of blaming ProBnergy or anyone for
problems found on the Barge. The Barge is a wealth of problem and none of them were
created by ProEnergy.

As soon as a manager starts blaming his people for his problems he loses my respect. There
he is in the meeting begging us to get the machine running no matter what. And when we
find failed parts and obsolete equiprent he asks us to find ways to work around them. So
what if the pipes were backwards its just one of a hundred problems we have had to work
through.

  

 

(x) Finally, ProEnergy described the condition of the facility in its Daily Report of

(b) Disputed Facts

i. The Claimant's Position

231. The Claimant asserts that the Power Station was capable of generating power on | November
2008, subject only to final testing and commissioning on 28 October 2008, which it claims it
was ready for.“* However, the Claimant contends that it was unable to complete the
commissioning within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date (March 2008) due to the alleged
breaches of the PPA by the Respondent.*”

ii. The Respondent’s Position

232. The Respondent maintains that the Power Station was not ready for final testing and
commissioning in October 2008 and, thus, was not ready to generate power on 1 November

2008.™° In support of its assertions in this regard, the Respondent makes reference to Baikan

representatives of BEL and ProEnergy, quoted above. The existence and authenticity of these

documents are not disputed by the Claimant.

Balkan US's Pleadings and Testimony in the ProEnergy Litigation

n
a
a

The Respondent avers that the Balkan US’s pleadings and testimony in the ProEnergy Litigation
show that “the Power Station could not have been ready for Final Testing and Commercial
Operation as of October 28, 2008, regardless of whether there was grid connectivity or not”!
Consequently, the Respondent argues that the Claimant failed to commission the Power Station

in 2008,

The Respondent further asserts that, notwithstanding the Claimant’s claims in this arbitration
that Ghana is to blame for its inability to complete the commissioning within ninety (90) days of
the Effective Date (March 2008), “Balkan’s unwavering position in the ProEnergy Litigation,
some three years later, was just the opposite, that ProEnergy could, and should, have completed
the commissioning of the Power Station by March, 2008, pursuant to the terms of its contract
with Balkan.”*” In support, the Respondent relies on the documents it obtained as a result of the
US District Court’s Orders dated 7 February and 6 June 2011, drawing attention to certain
contradictions between the Claimant's pleadings in this arbitration and the position it took in the

ProEnergy Litigation.“

The Respondent emphasizes that, in the ProBnergy Litigation, Balkan
US “details ProEnergy’s failures at length,” failures which it argues “are wholly inconsistent
with the claim ... that it is entided to [TJolling [FJees from November 1, 2008 forward and that
the Barge was ready for Final Testing and Commissioning as of October 28, 2008". In
particular, according to Balkan US in the ProEnergy Litigation, the stationary rotor blades of
one of the two turbines essential for operation of the Power Station were damaged after

ProEnergy unsuccessfully tied “for the one hundred and second time” to start the generator."

that the entire turbine housing wil] have to be disassembled and the rotor pulled”, costing

 

approximately USD 4 million.“

 

i Documents Produced from the ProEnergy Litigation

. 235. The Respondent contends that the documents produced from the ProBnergy Litigation

demonstrate “a deteriorating relationship between Balkan and ProEnergy with each accusing the

other for the delays and failure to commission the Power Station on schedule”, a

 

 

236. The Respondent further submits that, in addition to the problems with the Power Station and its

 

systems, both Messrs. Phillips and Elders testified in the ProEnergy Litigation that ProEnergy
site personnel were unqualified, ill-equipped and incompetent to perform the commissioning of

the Barge.“ Mr. Elders testified at his deposition, inter alia, that the ProEnergy workers “don’t

 

know what they’re doing. We've got people showing up on this job site that ... have never even
worked for ProEnergy”.*” With respect to the pipes leading from the fuel tanks, Mr. Elders
testified that “ProEnergy disassembled it, reassembled it wrong ~ we spend about six weeks ...
trying to start this barge with the fuel going through the wrong side”. According to Elders,
after ProEnergy left the job site in November 2008, Balkan had to go back and correct

ProEnergy’s work on multiple systems.”

Statement of Defense, para. 45, fn. 14: Respondent submits that a “representative sample of these
documents is attached for the Tribunal’s review as exhibits”, but as there were approximately 17.000
documents produced, “{lJeast Balkan claim that the Government has merely cherry-picked a few
documents ~ rather than a representative sample - the Government is prepared to provide the Tribunal
with the entire production should the Tribunal wish.”

The Respondent also draws attention to Mr. Elders’ testimony that ProEnergy continually
represented to Balkan that they would and could complete this project on or before early March
2008, being the Completion Date under the PPA. When asked whether the commissioning was
“even close to being complete” at the time when ProEnergy left the work site in November
2008, Mr. Elders replied that it was not.

According to the Respondent a site visit was conducted by the Respondent on November 21,
2008 and this “confirmed Elders’ testimony that commissioning of the Barge as of that date was

not even “close to being complete"?

EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND COMMISSIONING WORK ON THE POWER
STATION COMPLETED BY THE CLAIMANT IN 2009

L Undisputed Facts

As already mentioned above, the Claimant sent the Respondent an invoice for Tolling Fees on
25 November 2008.5" In response, the Respondent wrote to the Claimant on 19 February 2009
to request that the Parties meet to discuss the Tolling Fees and commissioning progress at the
Barge, which they did on 24 February 2009.** At this meeting, the Respondent requested that
the Claimant withdraw its invoices and that it should propose an action plan to operationalize
the Barge.***

On 25 February 2009, the Claimant wrote to the Respondent, again claiming entitlement to
Tolling Fees due to lack of grid connectivity, as well as proposing amendments to the PPA and

ee 337
the commissioning process.”

(a) The Claimant's Position

245. On 2 March 2009, the Claimant professes to have run a successful test of FSNL on Turbine 1,
and on Turbine 2 on 12 July 2009. The Claimant asserts that, on 9 July 2009, Ansaldo
certified that the milestone of FSNL had been reached, albeit “without electrical grid
connectivity” In its Post-Hearing Submission, the Claimant further clarifies that it was never

able to complete full mechanical testing at FSNL due to the lack of grid connectivity, since, as

certified by Ansaldo, “you could not conduct the type of continuous commissioning activities

that mechanical testing at FSNL entailed using the Black Start Generator on the Barge”.**

(b) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent reiterates its claim that that grid connectivity was available to BEL as early as
July 2008.*” It also notes that, according to the Respondent's expert, Peter Fairhurst. it is
possible, and indeed appropriate, to run an FSNL without grid connectivity using the Black
Start Generator.” The Respondent goes on to state that, even if the Claimant indeed achieved
FSNL for the Turbines, which Respondent disputes, it emphasizes that “running a turbine at
{FSNL] does not demonstrate that it is possible to excite the generator to rated voltage or that

the generators themselves are in operating condition or able to generate voltage or that a myriad

 

of other mechanical and electrical systems are operational.” In this regard, the Respondent
contends that the Claimant’s “{I]abelling {of FSNL] as a ‘milestone’... is a clever misnomer.”*”7
In particular, the Respondent draws support for its challenge of the Claimant’s assertion that it
reached FSNL on the Turbines from the test results and letters from Ansaldo submitted by the
Claimant, which the Respondent contends are “incomplete”, non-compliant with the
International Organization for Standardization’s testing standards (“ISO Testing Standards”)
for FSNL tests, “and were not approved or witnessed by the Government pursuant to Clause 6.1

of the PPA

 

 

With respect to the testing of Turbine 1, the Respondent submits that Ansaldo’s 12 October
2009 “activity report”, which certified that Turbine 1 had achieved FSNL, was drafted “seven
months after the [FSNL] test was performed in March 2009, and contains no contemporaneous
testing data from the pcs”. The Respondent also contends that this report does not outline

Ansaldo’

 

‘performance standards against which to measure the test results”; “has no
corroboratory signatures by Ansaldo or Balkan, nor any information as to who at Ansaldo

conducted the test of his or her qualifications to do so”; that “the terms and conditions of this

& performance test were not determined by the [Pjarties”; and that “the Government received no
fi advance notice of the test.”*”* The Respondent further emphasizes that this report notes that the

“Gas turbine tipped} after about 50 [seconds] at nominal speed”. *" Furthermore, the

Respondent draws the Tribunal’s attention to the Claimant’s factual assertion in the ProEnergy

e Litigation that the rotor blades of Turbine 1 were irreparably damaged by ProEnergy, and that
e
Me “[Uhose blades, according to Balkan, had not been replaced at the time of this test.”°””

248. The Respondent draws further support for its counter-assertion that the Claimant did not
successfully test the Turbines at FSNL from the report by ABB dated 30 June 2009, wherein
ABB certified that Turbine 2 had successfully been tested at ¥SNL.*” The Respondent asserts
that this report shows that the Claimant “had removed various inhibitors to prevent the turbine
from tripping so as to artificially reach [PSNL]” and that “various inhibitors in the [Turbine] 1
software were ‘blocked’, and that there were differences between the software for [Turbines] 1

and 2 (although they are the exact same turbines and should have the same testing

 

standards). In this regard, the Respondent submits that the removal of the inhibitors 2

380

contravenes ISO Testing Standards. *’ Furthermore, the Respondent relies on excerpts of

 

pst ssertion that the Claimant and “ABB were

 

“notable statements in the report’””’ in support of its
able to reach [FSNL] only by disabling key aspects of the logic software and removing various
inhibitors that would have tripped the [Turbine 2] and shut it down prior to its achieving

(FSNL]"3?

249. Finally, the Respondent submits that the Claimant never tested the Turbines at FSNL, as was in
fact conceded by one of the Claimant's witnesses.’ The Respondent contends that what the

Claimant had achieved was “but a first step in the much longer process of other necessary

G. THE LETTER OF CREDIT
i, Undisputed Facts

(a) Clause 11.7 of the PPA

  

251, The PPA defines “Letter of Credit” as “an izvevocable standby letter of credit provided to BE[L]

 

by [Ghana] as provided in Clause 11.7 and also in the form set forth in the Tenth Schedule.”

Clause 11.7 of the PPA provides as follows:

 

In order to provide BE[L] assurance of payments as will be required by its lenders, [Ghana]
shall on or before the Effective Date provide a Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the
sum of the Tolling Fees and fuel Cost payable over sixty (60) days based on the then
current Contracted Capacity (subject to adjustment each Contract Year to reflect the then
current Contracted Capacity) and assuming that the Power Station is operated at 125 MW.
each day for such sixty (60) day period (as adjusted from time to time the “Letter of Credit
Amount”), issued by a financial institution reasonably acceptable to BE[L], as security for
the timely payment of all sums due to BE[L] hereunder from [Ghana]. [Ghana] covenants
and agrees to provide BE[L] no later than (30) days prior to the expiration of any existing
letter of Credit a replacement Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the then current Letter
of Credit amount. BE{L] shall be entitled to draw upon any Letter of Credit without further
notice to [Ghana] for any payment due to BE[L]} from [Ghana] that is overdue for at least
fifteen (15) days. [Ghana] further covenants and agrees that upon the draw of funds by
BE[L] under any Letter of Credit provided hereunder, [Ghana] shall provide to BE[L] an
additional letter of Credit equal to the amount drawn under any such Letter of Credit. In the :
event that [Ghana] fails to arrange issuance and funding of any Letter of Credit required ix
hereunder within fifteen (15) days after the obligation to provide any such Letter of Credit
to BE[L] arises, such failure shall be deemed to be a flagrant disregard of its obligations
hereunder and BE{L] shall be entitled (following prior written notice to [Ghana]) to (i)

obligations under this Clause 11.7 and (ii) draw down the outstanding balance of any Letter
of Credit previously provided to BE{L] by {Ghana]; provided that, so long as [Ghana] is
current with all payments due to BE[L] under this Agreement, BE[I.] shall not be entitled to

provisions of Clause 17.1 shall apply. Subject to the laws of Ghana all payments made by
[Ghana] shall be made free and clear of and without any deduction for or on account of any
set-off, counterclaim, tax or otherwise and all such payments will be increased by the
[Government of Ghana] as required in section 11.2, above.

 

  

(b) Chronology of the Letters of Credit Issued by the Respondent

252. On 24 August 2007, Stanbic Bank issued a Letter of Credit to the Claimant.’ On 28 January

 

2009, the Respondent issued a new Letter of Credit.’ On 23 January 2010, the Respondent

issued a renewed Letter of Credit.”

“should have provided a replacement” — instead of merely issuing a renewed Letter of Credit on

23 January 2010.%°

254, The Claimant further states that it switched from Stanbic Bank to Zenith Bank, sometime in late

2007 or early 2008.” According to the Claimant, the Respondent’ s “failure to allow BE[L] to
draw upon the [Letter of Credit] ... caused severe problems between BE[L] and its current

lender, Zenith Bank,” including the freezing by the latter of BEL’s accounts as of 19 February

 

2010 due to the Letter of Credit issued by the Respondent on 23 January 2010 not being

398

compliant with the PPA.”

On
an

According to the Respondent, the essence of the Claimant’s “complaint appears to be that the
Government has refused to certify, under the terms of the [Letter of Credit], that Balkan is
entitled to Tolling Fees.” The Respondent contends that, as first drafted by it in 2007, the

PPA contained a requirement in clause 46(a) that the Respondent shall certify any entitlement

 

by the Claimant to Tolling Fees.” In support of its contention, the Respondent refers to a letter

According to the Respondent, it follows that since the Claimant is not entitled to Tolling Fees,
the Respondent “is not in breach of the [Letter of Credit} or the PPA by reason of its refusal to

provide a false certification to the Stanbic Bank”."”

256. With reference to the Claimant's allegation that the replacement letters of credit were not
always issued 30 days prior to the expiry of the one previously issued, the Respondent further

submits that such claim must fail because (a) the PPA, in Clause 34.1.4.2, provides a 60-day

 

grace period in case of default; (b) any claim for breach was waived by the Claimant when it
accepted the replacement Letters of Credit without objection; (c) the Claimant suffered no

damage since it never sought to draw upon a letter of credit when one was not in place; and (d)

 

the obligation to provide a letter of credit is a contractual obligation under the PPA, which it

claims is void ab initio and therefore unenforceable“

H. EVENTS RELATED TO THE ARREST OF MESSRS. TIMOTHY EVERHART AND WILLIAM
BERKENBILE AND TO THE SEIZURE OF THE DCS FROM THE PROJECT SITE

1 Undisputed Facts

257. Mr. Timothy Everhart - an employee at BEL — was arrested by Ghanaian authorities on
9 January 2010 on suspicion that he was stealing the DCS from the Project Site.“°’ He was
subsequently released on 11 January 2010.“°* Mr. William Berkenbile — a mechanic for
ProEnergy Services LLC (BEL’s subcontractor) ~ was also arrested and the DCS was seized by
Ghanaian authorities “at about the same time.”

General, but that “[dJespite almost two years of investigation ... Mr. Everhart still has not been
exonerated.“ The Claimant further asserts that a representative of the US Embassy in Ghana
made three unsuccessful attempts to visit Mr. Everhart while he was incarcerated, and even
“filed a formal protest letter with Ghana after which they were allowed access to see him."
The Claimant also asserts that after he was released from jail two days after his arrest,
Mr. Everhart was not permitted to travel and was investigated by the Ghanaian authorities for
theft of computer equipment on the Project Site.‘'* The Claimant’s alleges that Mr. Everhart
was only arrested because the Claimant had decided to institute arbitration proceedings against
the Respondent.‘‘* In support of this assertion, the Claimant relies on Mr. Adama’s cross-
examination, which in the Claimant’s view revealed that, at the time be (Mr. Adama) went to
the site to arrest Mr. Everhart, he did not know who owned the aileged stolen items and that he
had no evidence that the items had been removed without the consent of relevant authorities of

Ghana.*

Ghanaian authorities,” the Claimant contends that these actions on the part of the Respondent

“were likewise baseless”, as the DCS was “either owned by or in the rightful possession of

trespass to chattels under Ghanaian law.""7

w iL THE TRIBUNAL’S ASSESSMENT AND CONSIDERATION OF THE FACTS
&.
y 1. The Negotiation of the PPA

262. The facts noted above concerning the negotiation of the PPA, as well as the Parties’ positions in

that respect, shed an important light on the business BEL and the Government of Ghana

 

intended to undertake and the terms on which they agreed to operate. Despite the massive

 

amount of documentation and the extensive pleadings submitted in this arbitration, it is
important not to lose sight of the essential commitments and undertakings of the parties during
the negotiation of the PPA and the context in which these commitments and undertakings were

made.

263. The MOU signed by the Parties on 16 May 2007 clearly reflects what the Parties expected to
achieve by means of this understanding. While Ghana needed some mitigation of the acute
power shortage that was affecting the country at the time, the Claimant was prepared to commit
itself to make the Barge operational in a short period of time. To this end BEL proposed to
make the Barge operational within ninety days from the execution of the PPA, This proposal
outbid all other interested competitors for the project who had estimated longer periods to bring

the Barge into operation. The Government of Ghana accepted BEL’s proposal.

264, The proposals made by Mr. Elders were not based on theoretical considerations but foliowed a
very specific technical study contained in the “Master Energy Plan and Report of Site Survey”,
submitted to the Ministry of Energy on 14 May 2007, which was followed on 24 May 2007 by a
detailed Technical and Commercial Proposal. The ninety-day undertaking for the refurbishment
and commissioning of the Barge is prominent in this proposal, as were a number of milestone

events later to be included in the Third Schedule to the PPA.

 

265. It did not take long for the negotiations of the PPA to reach the crucial element of the fees that
would be paid for accomplishing this project. The Tribunal notes that on 14 June 2007 Mr.
Elders submitted to the Ministry of Energy a “Tariff Analysis Report’, to be followed shorily
thereafter by the Letter of Intent provided to him by the Ministry of Energy proposing a lower
tariff rate for the Tolling Fees. At Mr. Elders request, on 21 June 2007, the Ministry of Energy

provided him with a letter of intent which proposed a lower tariff rate for the Tolling Fees,

]

266. As from that point the negotiations were largely concerned with the question of Tolling Fees
evidencing the disagreement of the parties about this element and other technical aspects of the

' project. As has been noted, a meeting was held on 11 July 2007 between Messrs. Elders and

PCA 117830 84

 

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 103 of 264

Amo and Ghana’s President at the time, Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, seeking to unblock the

 

obstacles that had impeded the progress of those negotiations. A further conversation was
apparently held between the President and Mr. Phillips which the Claimant asseris was key to
his decision to make the necessary investment for undertaking the project. Although there is no
record or other evidence of these conversations, except for the witness statements of the
Claimant's officials concerned, and there are no comments by the Respondent on these
conversations, the fact that the PPA and related agreements were signed on 27 July 2007
indicate that the negotiations were in the end successful. The Effective Date of the PPA was

agreed as 31 October 2007.

267. In the course of the negotiations on the PPA, BEL was registered as a locally incorporated
company to comply with Ghana’s legal requirements. This fact, together with the legal opinions
issued by Ghana’s Minister of Justice and Attorney General on 26 October 2007, is at the heart

of the legal aspects of this dispute and as such will be examined further below.

268. While the Claimant suggests that the Respondent had hidden motives to delay the negotiations

and to impede their successful conclusion, nothing in the factual record of this case so confirms

 

ficulties arose from the economic considerations

 

or implies. In the Respondent’s view such di
underlying the various proposals. The facts discussed lead the Tribunal to believe that the latter
was indeed the case. If there were other motives, these have not been supported by the evidence

and are hence more a matter of speculation than of established fact.

269. Despite the difficulties the negotiations faced, in the end the agreed PPA established two sets of
clearly defined obligations. For BEL it was to lease the Power Station from Ghana and have it
ready for commercial operation, with the capacity to deliver 125 MW to the National Grid,
within ninety days from the Effective Date of the PPA. A cost of USD 40 million was estimated
at the time for this undertaking, with the additional important commitment that BEL would bear
all costs of the commissioning. In addition, BEL would convert the Power Station into a
combined cycle power plant, at the estimated cost of USD 100 million,. Other stages of the
project included the addition of two more combined cycle barge mounted systems at an
estimated cost of USD 250 to 300 million, investment in infrastructure for the supply of natural

gas and BEL’s commitment to provide all the required fuel to the Project and pay for its cost.

270, Ghana's responsibilities were equally clearly established. It would ensure that all necessary site
electricity was provided; would construct, install and connect the transmission line and relay
protection equipment to connect the Power Station to the National Grid, with BEL providing for

4 grid; and “take and pay” for all electricity generated by the Power Station during the term of the
% Agreement. Governmental approvals, administrative permits and other regulatory requirements

would be ensured by Ghana.

271. An important aspect of the PPA was the Parties’ commitment to ensure mutual collaboration to

achieve the objectives of the Agreement and the performance of their respective obligations. As

 

an additional safeguard it was further provided that should BEL be unable to commence testing

   

of the Power Station as a result of Ghana’s failure to provide an adequate transmission line and
interconnection facilities for the Power Station, Ghana would be obligated to commence paying

Tolling Fees to BEL in accordance with para. 11.9 of the PPA.

As is only too evident from the Parties’ submissions in this case, the performance of each other
in respect of these reciprocal commitments and obligations has been disputed. While the
Claimant maintains that the reason why the project could not be completed on time was because
of Ghana's failure to provide for the necessary electricity and power lines and other elements of

non-performance, Ghana contends that all the assurances given by BEL in the course of the

 

negotiations turned to be untrue as the latter had neither the capability or the experience to do
the job. The Tribunal’s task is to find out, on the facts of the case, which party is right or wrong
in its contentions and attach the corresponding legal consequences, which will be addressed

further below.

2. The Facts Concerning the Power Station and the Barge

273. Of the facts noted there are two that stand out as crucial for the resolution of the dispute
between the Parties. The first concerns the point where the respective Parties have the
responsibility for connecting the Barge to the national grid. It will be seen that the point where
the Claimant’s responsibility for the connection ends and that of the Respondent begins has
been the matter of important debate. The second question concerns which Party has the
obligation to pay for the RTU, MicroSCADA system and the DSC. While they are located on
the Barge, these systems are also important for the proper functioning of the equipment in the

Substation.

274. The Claimant contends that final commissioning cannot be achieved without the final

connection to the G-NITS as it is the essential source of power for the operation of the turbines

and the their testing. The Respondent, on the other hand, is of the view that the 161 kV
electrical system must be fully operational before the Power Station can be connected to the

Grid as it is the key element for allowing power to be exported from the Barge and energy

imported into it, as required. The ion of the respecti ponsibilities will be

further below,

3. The Facts Concerning the Commissioning Steps

The Parties also disagree on the steps that must be followed to achieve proper commissioning of
the Power Station. The four “milestones” identified by the Claimant do not appear
objectionable, and this is also true of the more detailed enumeration set out in

Mr. Brinckerhoff’s Expert Report and submitted by the Respondent. Both are descriptive of the

 

sequence of events that are necessary to finalize commissioning. However, in the view of the
Tribunal, what matters is not so much how many milestones have been achieved but the end
result: that is to say whether the point has been reached at which the Power Station is generating
the required amount of electricity and, subject to interconnection, ready to deliver to the
National Grid. As has become evident from the facts discussed above the Power Station was not
ready to generate and deliver the required amount at the date established in the PPA, and it is

still not ready to do so, even though some of the required steps may have been achieved.

A related issue is whether the Parties were required to cooperate to achieve the final point of
commissioning, whatever that might have been. While the Claimant maintains that the standards
of conduct between owner and contractor to this end identified by Mr. Badger are inapplicable

in this case because BEL had no obligations in this respect and the Respondent had no right to

 

participate in the commissioning process, the Tribunal must recall that one of the essential
elements of the PPA, as noted above in respect of the negotiation process, was the Parties”
commitment to ensure mutual collaboration to achieve the objectives of the Agreement and the
performance of their respective obligations. That the Parties should work in isolation from each

other does not seem to be consistent with their commitments under the PPA.

The facts relating to the Turning Gear and First Fire of the Turbines as the preliminary
commissioning steps are not difficult to establish. It is not disputed that such steps were attained
in the course of 2008 although the precise dates are not entirely clear. But what matters is to
establish whether these steps led ultimately to the steps necessary to reach the required

operational capacity.

The answer to this question appears to be in the negative. The Respondent’s contention is that
First Fire was attained for a very short period of time, estimated in the seconds or minutes, and
that this was done by manipulating certain functions of the control systems that were essential

for a proper attainment of the steps to follow, including the closely related stage of FSNL. The

PCA 117830 87

 

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 106 of 264

Tribunal considers that the contention of the Respondent is convincing having regard to the
record of evidence chronicling the many difficulties that key pieces of equipment experienced.
The evidence available shows that critical systems such as the Turbines, DCS, fuel tanks,
161kV GIS switchgear, transformer and relay protection devices had all been affected at one
time or other by serious problems in their functioning. Given these shortcomings it is clear to
the Tribunal that it would not have been possible to attain the steps required in a technically

reliable manner, as wil] be discussed below.

4. The Facts en the Availability of Site Electricity

279. This is another aspect in respect of which the Parties have diametrically opposed views. The

main issues are whether site electricity, i.e. the required capacity that ought to be supplied, was

 

available, whether this was available at the appropriate time, and above ali, whether in the end

the commissioning process was negatively impacted and made more costly.

280. The Tribunal notes that although the Claimant has made contradictory assertions in some
documents, submissions or depositions, with particular reference to Mr. Elders certification in
2007 that electricity had been supplied at the required voltage and frequency, there are also facts
that point to the difficulties the Claimant faced in this connection. The Tribunal finds the
Claimant’s assertion that the supply of electricity was intermittent and was cut off for periods of
hours and days, and its claim that generators had to be purchased to deal with this problem, to
be credible. It is a situation which is not surprising in a rural setting and in remote villages of a

developing country,

281. Whether the capacity supplied was adequate is also disputed, but there can be no doubt that the
difficulties encountered had a negative effect on the commissioning process and indeed
increased its costs. It is difficult to establish for how long this effect lasted but it can be safely
noted that it did not extend beyond the point in time at which the generators became fully
operational. Thus. it can safely be assumed that the following steps in the commissioning

process could not have been impeded by this factor.

5, The Turbines Mechanical Testing at FSNL

282. The mechanical testing of the turbines at FSNL was not successful. The record is sufficiently
clear as to the problems that plagued the rehabilitation of the equipment and its operation. The
delivery of supplies was estimated to take up to 30 months and the rehabilitation would take

until 2011, the dates varying for each turbine. The costs of rehabilitating were also estimated to

287.

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 107 of 264

be significant. Among other factors compounding these difficulties was the question whether
liquid fuel should be used for the power generation, and if so which kind and price, or whether

natural gas should be used instead.

The Tribunal must also note that in the circumstances the certification made in 2009 by Ansaldo
as to the turbines having completed the FSNL milestone is unrealistic, particularly if taken
together with the Claimant’s complaint that grid connectivity was not available. It must also be
noted that afier the Claimant asserted that it had attained that milestone, it later conceded that it

had not attained the milestone because of the alleged lack of grid connectivity.

The Respondent, however, has argued that the transmission line was only necessary to attain the
later milestone of FSFL, and that testing at FSNL could have been achieved using the Black
Start Generator but that this could not be done because of the state of disrepair of the turbines.
As this discussion is closely related to the issue of grid connectivity, this aspect of the dispute

will be examined next in the light of the facts.

6. The Facts Concerning Grid Connectivity

The state of the connection and transmission lines to the Essiama and Elubo substations has
been also much debated. It is not disputed, however, that as at present the Elubo substation
cannot receive back-feed from the Barge. The Parties also disagree on whether the Essiama
substation can take the full load from the Barge or whether the Elubo transmission line must be

operational for this to happen.

The fact that these lines were not fully operational for the needs of the project at the time work
on the Power Station was supposed to be progressing, particularly because of the dense tree
overgrowth that interfered with the route of the lines, is well established. Photographic evidence
in the record is convincing to this effect. Notwithstanding maintenance work occasionally
carried out by the Respondent the problem appears to have endured. That the Essiama line was
energised in mid 2008 is also a well established fact, but the question that remains is whether

this was enough for handling the output of the Barge, assuming that this was available,

It is important to note in this connection that, in accordance to the Respondent’s information,
the Essiama Transmission Line to Tower 3 was in fact energised on 8 August 2008, and there is
no reason to doubt the accuracy of this assertion. Whether this was enough to connect the Barge
to the National Grid, as stated by the Respondent, is open to some doubt, in part because the

capacity of the line was at the limit of the Barge’s maximum output and in part because,

PCA 117830 89

 

 

 

 

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 108 of 264

according to the Claimant, there were some technical issues concerning the backfeeding of the
Elubo substation. The ability of the Elubo Transmission Line to deliver the required power and
to handle the Power Station output is also somewhat doubtful. The Claimant’s argument that
both substations should be coordinated in their operation is convincing as otherwise there would

have been no need for two transmission lines.

 

‘ 7 The Commissioning of the RTU/Micro Scada System

288. It is also a well established fact in the record that BEL, through ProEnergy acting as its
subcontractor, requested several proposals from other parties to commission the RTU system on
the Barge. From the exchanges with these other parties it appears that the work to be performed
did not involve merely repair or even upgrading of the system but that an entirely new system
would have to be installed with the corresponding cost. While in the “Grid Connection Process
Agreement”, concluded between the Claimant and the Respondent at a meeting held on 17 June
2008, the latter was to use its contacts to seek a proposal from ABB, it was nonetheless

established that BEL would be responsible for this commissioning.

289. As a matter of fact, the Grid Connection Process Agreement (R-52) concluded between the
Claimant and the VRA provided for the Claimant's obligations as to the commissioning of the
RTU. These obligations were expressed as follows: “upon completion and review of the above
pre-energization check list, Balkan Energy will contract an Independent Third Party
Testing Company to perform a complete installation, engineering and commissioning
overview: this will include review of the VRA Audit. Upon completion of the third party
inspection, Balkan Energy and the VRA must agree jointly in acceptance and connection of the
161 kV Transmission Line to the Barge”. Although the drafting of these terms was not as clear
as would have been desired it is nonetheless reasonable to conclude that while the
commissioning of the RTU was the Claimant’s responsibility, this would be subject to an audit
by the VRA and the process as a whole would then be further subject to the supervision of the
contracted third party. It must also be noted that the text of the Agreement does not refer to the

Respondent’s obligation to seek a proposal from ABB.

290. Beginning in October 2008 BEL came to the view that payment for the system was Ghana’s
responsibility and that prior discussions with third parties to undertake such work were only
meant to appraise itself of the scope of the work so that the Claimant could appropriately

| coordinate with the Respondent. In its view the Grid Connection Process Agreement had

provided for Respondent’s contractors Forclum and Norlec for commissioning the new

PCA 117830 90

 

 

291.

293.

PCA

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 109 of 264

MicroSCADA system and that GridCo as the government operator of the National Grid was
under the jaw of Ghana under the obligation to ensure and consequently pay for this

commissioning.

While the Grid Code promulgated in 2009 does contain this provision which imposes the
obligation on GridCo,, it must be noted that this happened two years after the conclusion of the
PPA, thus the terms of the Code are not dispositive of the issue under discussion. Even so the
Claimant asserts that prudent industry practice and prior law still placed this obligation on
Ghana at the time of the conclusion of the PPA, as reflected in the 2007 version of the Grid
Code and its connection to the regulations passed in June 2008 drafted on the basis of that
version. The fact remains, however, that the Grid Code was formally promulgated much later
than the PPA and only became legally binding after the PPA has been concluded. It must also
be noted, as the Respondent points out, that the Grid Code expressly states that it was not
intended to alter pre-existing contractual obligations. Article 4.18 of the 2009 Grid Code in fact
provides: “The Grid Code shall apply to all such existing contracts insofar as the Grid Code.

does not impair the obligations arising from the existing contract.”

Still more important than the legal considerations is the actual discussion that took place
between BEL and the third parties that would perform the work concerning the RTU system.
The Respondent points out that the Claimant attempted to find a vendor for this work as soon as
it assumed control of the Barge and never forwarded any of their proposals to the Respondent.
Eyen the guidelines provided to ABB for this commissioning, which as noted were requested by
intermediation of the Government, were drafted by the Claimant and, tellingly, provided that
only the Claimant’s listed personnel would be authorized to communicate with the
subcontractor. Equally telling is the fact that ABB’s proposal identified BEL as the “Customer”,
The Claimant asserts that this was only meant to facilitate the commissioning and that it
volunteered to help with the costs but it never agreed that this task was within its responsibility.
However, the fact remains that for all practical purposes it was the Claimant who appeared as

the entity responsible for this mandate to subcontractors.

The facts thus point in the direction that it was the Claimant's responsibility to pay for the
commissioning of the system. Yet, as the Respondent has also noted, the Claimant has provided
no evidence that the work was completed or when, as it neither notified the Respondent that the
RTU was installed and that connection to the National Grid was requested to complete the

commissioning.

117830 91

 

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 110 of 264

 

294, The Parties have also di d the functions and i for the operation of the

 

RTU/MicroSCADA system, particularly about its role in respect of the connection of the Power

Station to the National Grid. There can be no doubt about the fact that this system is necessary

 

for the appropriate operation of the connection to the National Grid as it would have been

otherwise futile to include it in the works to be undertaken on the Barge and generally in the

 

Grid Code and its background documents. The issue, however, is how decisive this factor is in

 

ensuring that the commissioning of the Barge can be achieved. While the Claimant maintains
that it is critical, the Respondent is of the view that it is preferable but not essential. The
Respondent asserts that, in any event what is essential is that the 161kV electrical system on the

Barge should be in place.

295. The Tribunal is convinced by the Claimant's arguments that the RTU system is necessary for
the proper functioning of the interconnection to the National Grid and that the commissioning of
the Barge would have been more difficult to attain without it. It is equally convinced, however,
that, as noted by the Respondent, for any such functions to be properly handled the 161kV
electrical system must be available as otherwise it appears to be immaterial that the control
center would be on the Barge, close to it in the Substation or far away because there would have
been nothing to monitor or control. Jt must be kept in mind that the RTU/MicroSCADA systems
are monitoring and contro! devices for the connections to and from the Barge, the operation of
which requires in the instant case the electrical output to monitor and control. But such an
electrical system does not appear to have been completed and this would have in itself

prevented the connection to the National Grid irrespective of the fact that the RTU was in place.

296. The Claimant also states that even if the RTU is commissioned, interconnection cannot occur
unless “both sides exchange (coordinate) ail of their separate 161 kV protective relay
settings”,"? thus confirming that both the RTU and the 161 kV system are necessary to connect
to the National Grid. The technical details submitted as Auachment 6 to Mr. MacDonald’s
affidavit" demonstrate that the RTU 2,000 MicroScada is the source of automation for the GIS,

which in turn is an essential element of the 161 kV electrical system. The same document also

validity of this opinion can be seriously put in doubt as the facts examined above suggest that

the generator may well be capable of handling the commissioning tasks.

8. The Testing and Commissioning of the Barge at the End of 2008

In the course of the second half of 2008 it became noticeable that distrust had begun to
characterize the relations between the Parties about the work each was supposed to perform. In
July of that year the Respondent had written to BEL confirming that the Essiama Transmission
Line was ready to be energised, while at the same time it requested the Claimant to witness and
sign-off the commissioning tests of the 161 kV equipment and protection relays that the
Claimant was to make available for the final commissioning of the Barge and its connection to
the National Grid. As noted, no answer was received to these requests. For its part, the Claimant
informed the Respondent in October 2008 that the Power Station would be ready for Final
Testing and Commissioning at the end of that month and would be ready to start generating
power on i November 2008. This was to be followed by the connection of the Transmission
Line from the National Grid to the Power Station so as to test all systems on the Barge and
deliver power to the National Grid. As discussed above. it appears that the work on the 161 kV
electrical system had not been completed at that time and in the Respondent's view was never

completed,

Another major source of conflict was the bad relationship that had developed between BEL and
its subcontractor ProEnergy, which ended up in serious allegations being made by the former
against the latter in the litigation they were involved in before the US courts. The exchanges that
had taken place between these two entities in 2008 are very illuminating on the issue whether
the work on the Barge had been completed and was ready for final testing and commissioning.
They show that, in spite of the assurances given by Ansaldo and other persons that the turbines
had reached FSNL, ProEnergy believed that this had never happened, or if it had it was for not
more than ten seconds, with multiple incidents of electrical and mechanical failures in the

process.

It is a fact that the Power Station was not ready to deliver energy on 1 November 2008. While
the Claimant asserts that commissioning could not be completed on time because of the
Respondent’s breaches of the PPA, the fact remains that what BEL had announced i.e. that the
Barge was ready to deliver power on 1 November 2008 was not the case. Again on this matter

the allegations made in the US litigation, just as the testimony provided in those proceedings,

117830 93

 

Rake

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 112 of 264

 

show that in BEL’s view ProBnergy was liable for repeated failures in the discharge of the work

ae

entrusted to it.

9. The Facts Concerning the Parties’ Negotiations of 2009

301. The discussion between the Parties continued into 2009 without any signs of improvement. The

Claimant had invoiced the Respondent for an amount of Tolling Fees on 25 November 2008 and

 

a meeting was held on 24 February 2009 to discuss this question and the commissioning at the
Barge, but it did not go beyond the Respondent requesting the Claimant to withdraw the
invoices and proposing a new plan for the Barge. Nevertheless an Inter-Ministerial Committee
was set up to review the PPA and the commissioning process and a site visit was conducted. A
further meeting was held on or about 12 July 2009 to discuss the question of FSNL, fuel supply
and other matters, but no progress was made, as evidenced by the fact that on 7 August 2009 the
Respondent again rejected the Claimant’s invoices and denied the Claimant’s entitlement to
Tolling Fees. On the same day the Claimant delivered a notice of breach of the PPA and

decided to draw upon the Letter of Credit.

302. The Claimant’s position on the facts is that FSNL of Turbine | was attained on 2 March 2009
and of Turbine 2 on 12 July of that year, emphasizing that Ansaldo had certified this fact on
9July 2009 and noting that this milestone had been achieved without electrical grid
connectivity. The Tribunal must note in this respect that this contention confirms the fact
discussed above that FSNL can be run without grid connectivity using the Black Start
Generator, as the Respondent has argued, and that, in any event, as also noted, grid connectivity

had been available much earlier, as asserted by the Respondent.

303. The Tribunal must also state that it is skeptical about the value of Ansaldo’s certification of
these facts, as the letters submitted by Ansaldo do not allow concluding that the proper tests
were conducted by qualified experts. Moreover, these tests were not approved or witnessed by
the Respondent in accordance with the requirements of the PPA, as the Respondent has pointed
out. The information available from the ProBnergy Litigation is also not helpful to support the
Claimant's assertions. In the ProEnergy Litigation, the Claimant argued that the rotor blades had
been irreparably damaged by the subcontractor, and, as noted further above, ProEnergy had
adamantly expressed its conclusions that the turbines had never been fired at FSNL, and that it
was prepared to so testify. In any event, if the turbines had been fired at all this has been for few
seconds or minutes and after bypassing the technical requirements for reaching proper

functioning of the turbines.

10. The Facts Relating to the Letter of Credit i
4
304. The facts concerning this other point of contention between the Parties are first that there was 4

indeed an obligation for Ghana to make available a Letter of Credit to the Claimant under
Clause 11.7 of the PPA, which would provide the necessary assurances to BEL’s lenders. This
obligation was satisfied by the Respondent on 24 August 2007 on Stanbic Bank issuing such a
Letter, which was thereafter renewed in 2009 and 2010. The Letter of Credit under Clause 11.7
was for an amount equal to the sum of Tolling Fees and fuel cost payable over sixty days, on the
basis of a certain output of power and other reguirements. Jt is also quite evident that absent
such @ power output, entilement to Tolling Fees would become moot and the Letter of Credit
would be deprived of its legal basis under the Contract. It has also been established above that
the necessary power output was never attained as the Power Station could not be commissioned

on time.

305. Thus the issue of the Claimant's complaints about the fact that BEL was not issued with a
replacement Letter of Credit are inextricably linked to the question whether entitlement to
Tolling Fees was properly established. Such entitlement required formal approval by the
Respondent of the Claimant's invoices, which, as noted above, never happened since the
Respondent rejected the invoices in 2009. The Tribunal must also note that under Clause 11.7 of
the PPA, the consequences of a breach by the Respondent would be that the Claimant could
draw on the existing Letter and, above all, that it would suspend the delivery of electricity.
‘There was thus an express link between the purpose of the Letter of Credit and the delivery of

power from the Barge. While the Claimant complains that it could not present the issuing bank

 

with an undisputed bill signed by the Respondent, the fact is that the bill was indeed disputed.
The Claimant complains that BEL’s situation became more difficult when it switched from
Stanbic Bank to Zenith Bank because a Letter of Credit was not unavailable and this resulted in
the latter Bank freezing BEL’s accounts in 2010. But this does not change the fact that the

absence of power delivery and consequential loss of BEL’s entitlement to Tolling Fees meant

that the requirements for issuing the Letter of Credit could not be met. As noted by the {

Respondent it would otherwise have issued a false certification to the bank.

306. In the Tribunal’s assessment of the facts, the dispute about whether renewals were issued in
time, whether there were tacit waivers by the Claimant or whether the Claimant could not draw
on the Letter of Credit because there was no such Letter, and therefore no damage could be
caused, is moot in light of the incontestible fact that power delivery was unavailable and the

fact that this gave rise to the legal consequences noted. The Respondent has also argued that as

 

PCA 117830 95

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 114 of 264

this is in any event an obligation under the PPA which it claims is void ab initio, there would be

no obligation to enforce. The Tribunal shall examine the validity of the PPA below.

   

il. The Facts of the Arrests and Seizure of Equipment

4s, 307. It is also an established fact, not denied by the Respondent, that Mr. Timothy Everhart was

arrested by Ghanaian authorities on 9 January 2010 and later released on 1] January 2010.

 

Mr. William Berkenbile, an employee of ProEnergy was also detained for questioning at about
the same time. The stated reason for these arrests was the suspicion that the affected persons

were involved in misappropriating the DCS from the Project Site.

308. The Claimant asserts that Mr. Everhart was treated in an undignified manner and not allowed to
contact attorneys or the United States’ Embassy for over two days. While there is no evidence
of physical ill-treatment, the assertion that undignified treatment occurred can well be
considered credible (as might be the case in many countries, developed and less developed). The
U. 8. Embassy was ultimately contacted and it appears that it had to file a formal protest with
the Respondent to ensure proper access to the detainee. Subsequently to his release Mr. Everhart
was not permitted to travel and was investigated about the alleged theft of computer equipment,

procedures that in the Claimant's view have not yet resulted in his exoneration.

309, While the Claimant alleges that the arrests took place because the Claimant had instituted
arbitration proceedings, this would be difficult to establish. The arrests were undoubtedly
related to the ongoing dispute between the Parties and the mutual accusations that were made at
all levels. The fact, however, that these events coincided with the time arbitration proceedings
were instituted does not allow the Tribunal to rule out the Claimant's allegations in this respect.
As the DCS was BEL’s property or BEL had the rightful possession of the equipment, in the
Claimant's argument the seizure constitutes the torts of conversion and trespass to chattels
under Ghanaian law, as will be discussed further below. In the Tribunal’s view, Mr.Everhart’s
moving the DCS from one place to another within BEL’s leased domain was not justifiable

cause for his arrest.

THE PARTIES’ LEGAL ARGUMENTS
THE CLAIMANT’S CORPORATE IDENTITY

While the Respondent acknowledges that the Claimant in this arbitration purports to be BEL, it

asserts that BEL’s corporate identity, and that of its parent companies, is unclear.””! For its part,

422

the Claimant maintains that it was incorporated in Ghana on 16 July 2007.

During the negotiations that led up to the signing of the PPA, the Claimant represented to the
Respondent that it was a company registered in the Netherlands.” At the 15 October 2010
hearing on jurisdiction in this arbitration, the Tribunal requested that the Claimant describe its
relationship to the Balkan Group. On 5 November 2010, the Claimant submitted that it is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Balkan Energy Ltd. (UK) (“Balkan UK”), which, in turn, is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Balkan US, “a company incorporated in Texas, United States.“
The Claimant also explained that “[a]t no stage have any of these entities been incorporated in
the Netherlands.” Similarly, the witness statements accompanying the Claimant’s Statement
of Claim reiterate that it is a subsidiary of Balkan US, a company “formed to bring private

investment to developing countries with power generation needs”.*”

In its Statement of Defense, the Respondent submits that Balkan US is not registered with the
records department of the Texas Secretary of State. The Respondent further submits that, when

the Claimant was questioned about its corporate identity in a proceeding before the United

and whether Balkan fraudulently induced the Government to enter into the PPA by misrepresenting its
ownership structure, capabilities. and ability to commission a power barge.” The Respondent does not
detail the findings by the High Court on those issues in its Rejoinder. In its Post-Hearing Submission,
para. 7, the Respondent suggests that the Claimant “has offered conflicting versions of its corporate
structure to the Tribunal as well as to various courts in the United States and regulatory agencies” and that
the Claimant's “7, 2013 submission to the Tribunal [Claimant’s 7 June Letter] only added to the
confusion, raising additional questions about the accuracy of Balkan’s public filings.”

District Court subsequently concluded that Balkan US’s “existence is somewhat suspect

Jn its 10 July Letter, the Respondent notes that the Claimant has given five different versions of
BEL’s corporate structure throughout the proceedings, and points out several discrepancies.
First, the Claimant contends in its 7 June Letter that Syntek West transferred full ownership of
Balkan UK to Balkan Wyoming in September 2007, whereas the UK annual returns filed by
Balkan UK for 2009 and 2011 show that Syntek West still owned Balkan UK. Second, the
Claimant alleges that Balkan Wyoming transferred full ownership of Balkan UK to Balkan
Nevada in 2008,** whereas it also contends in a different document" that the ownership was
actually transferred to another entity, Balkan Energy LLP. Finally, the Claimant contends that

EPC International Inc., company owned by Mr. Elders, held a 10% of Balkan Wyoming in 2007
and another of Balkan Nevada in 2009, whereas the Texas Franchise Tax reports between 2006
and 2012 do not reflect this ownership.“ The Respondent concludes that the Claimant’s June 7
Letter has not remedied the concerns about BEL’s corporate structure, but has rather

compounded the issue.

317. In its Post-Hearing Submission, the Claimant reaffirms the fact that “it has not offered

 

inconsistent version of its ownership in this or any other proceedings but concedes the point
436

made by the Respondent’ that “Balkan UK Financial Reporting, as found on-line, incorrectly

 

stated the history of Balkan UK’s true corporate structure”, as apparently, “the loca! agent failed
to note the correct information in 2011". The Claimant suggests that the “unintentional
‘discrepancies’ only relate to the ownership of Balkan UK and nof to the ownership of BEL”
[emphasis added by the Claimant].” :
318. In its Post-Hearing Submission, the Respondent concludes that the Claimant “has offered

conflicting versions of its corporate structure to the Tribunal as well as to various courts in the

United States and regulatory agencies”, and highlights that “regardiess of who Balkan’s parent,

grandparent or owners actually are, it is clear that, contrary to the representation contained in

the Memorandum of Understanding (...) none of these Balkan entities had any prior experience

in refurbishing a power plant, much less a power plant in Africa”. “*

319. The Tribunal finds that the information regarding the corporate identity of the Claimant
company is indeed confusing, as claimed by the Respondent. During the negotiations leading to
the conclusion of the PPA, the Claimant asserted that BET was a company registered in the
Netherlands. Following the hearing on jurisdiction the Claimant explained that the company is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Balkan US which it said was incorporated in the State of Texas.
However, no records of the incorporation in Texas has so far been made available. It is also to
be noted that, in the US proceedings, the US Court was informed that the company had not in
fact been formally incorporated, and this led the US court to conclude that the situation was

| somewhat suspect. The information provided by the Claimant following the hearing on the

4 merits shows that, at the time of the signing of the PPA in 2007, Balkan UK had Nevada, Texas

and Wyoming corporate entities among its controllers. By 2008 this structure had changed to
include several Nevada corporations and one Texas corporation as the owners of Balkan UK.
Different information was included, apparently by mistake, in the UK financial reporting for

2009 and 2011.

While this inconsistent information led the US District Court to express skepticism about the
real corporate ownership of the Claimant company, this Tribunal must note that BEL was
incorporated in Ghana on 16 July 2007 pursuant to the requirement of Article 12 of the Ghana
Energy Commission Act which required all companies wishing to obtain a license to supply
bulk energy in Ghana to be incorporated in the country, and that BEL was registered under

Ghana’s Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179) as a locally incorporated company,

The Tribunal also notes, as stated in the exposition of the facts concerning the negotiation of the
PPA, that on 26 October 2007 the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Ghana issued two
legal opinions that have a strong bearing on this dispute. The first opinion dealt with the issue
whether the PPA involved an international business or commercial transaction, and the opinion
was that this was clearly not the case as it “involves a Jocal company in a local transaction with
the Government”. This was followed by another opinion in which the Attorney General stated
that all acts, conditions and things required by the laws and Constitution of Ghana had been
done, fulfilled and performed in the light of the Project Agreement concluded between the

Parties.

The Tribunal must also note that it is an accepted fact by both Parties that Balkan UK is the
parent company of BEL. The discussion about the Claimant's corporate identity relates rather to
a step further above concerning who controls or owns Balkan UK. While this discussion has
importance in the context of the validity of the PPA and whether this Contract should have been
submitted to Parliamentary approval because of its alleged international character, a matter to be
discussed further below, the fact is that for the purposes of this arbitration the Claimant is a

Ghanaian corporate entity properly constituted. In addition, the Tribunal recalls that issues of

 

jurisdiction were already decided in the Interim Award and hence the question of corporate

identity is not an obstacle for the decision on the merits.

THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS

On the basis of the facts examined and the Parties’ different understandings about their
meaning, the Parties have laid down their legal claims. The Claimant alleges that the

Respondent breached its obligations under the PPA by providing inadequate or unreliable site

electricity, failing to provide grid connectivity, and failing to install a new RTU / MicroSCADA
on the Barge, which the Claimant argues, prevented it from completing the final testing and
A commissioning of the Power Station. The Claimant asserts that it is entitled to damages based

on: (i) breach of contract, including incidental damages; (ii) breach of the Arbitration

Agreement; and (ii) alternatively, based on unjust enrichment, fraud/deceit, false arrest and

 

conversion/trespass.

¥
uy

324. The Respondent denies the claim of the Claimant for breach of contract on the following
grounds: first, the PPA is void ab initio under Article 181(5) of the Constitution; and second,
even if the PPA is enforceable, the Claimant is not entitled to any payments or damages under
the terms of the PPA." According to the Respondent, even if the Tribunal finds that the PPA is
valid and enforceable -- which it contends it cannot by virtue of the Supreme Court Judgment of
16 May 2012 — the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that il is entitled to Tolling Fees under
Clauses 11.4 and 11.9 of the PPA.” Similarly, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has
failed to establish that it is entitled to incidental damages relating to site electricity, grid

connectivity, the RTU, or the Letter of Credit."

325. The Respondent also submits that it is the Claimant that js in breach of the PPA for its failure to
commission the Power Station and, accordingly, the Respondent presents two counterclaims:

first, for breach of contract; and second, for fraud and misrepresentation.*”

CG SUPREME COURT PROCEEDINGS IN GHANA AND THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS ON THE
VALIDITY OF THE PPA

1 Introduction

326. The Tribunal shall consider now a key question of this arbitration, namely whether the PPA is
valid and enforceable, a matter on which the Parties’ have diametrically different views. To this
end the Supreme Court proceedings in Ghana shall be examined first to be followed by the
examination of the Parties’ positions thereon, which in their aggregate set out the legal
arguments surrounding this question. The discussion shall end with the Tribunal’s findings and

conclusions on the validity of the PPA.

On 25 June 2010, after the appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal and four days before the First
Procedural Meeting between the Parties was scheduled to take place on 29 June 2010, the
Respondent applied for and was granted an interlocutory injunction against the arbitral
proceedings by the High Court of Justice (Commercial Division) in Accra, Ghana, The
injunction restrained the Claimant from, infer alia, taking any further steps in the arbitration
proceedings pending final determination of the suit before the Ghana High Court. The
Respondent alleged, in its suit before the High Court, that the PPA and the arbitration clause,
which is part of the PPA, are void for lack of prior Parliamentary approval.” On 6 September
2010, the Ghana High Court issued a ruling confirming the Order and dismissing the Claimant’s

application for a stay of proceedings.“

On 3 November 2010, the Respondent moved for an expedited reference of the constitutional

issues involving the validity of the PPA to the Supreme Court of Ghana.“ The Claimant

446,

opposed the application.” When the matter came before the Supreme Court, the Claimant again

447

opposed the expedited reference.“’ Upon the Supreme Court’s granting of the expedited

reference,“*

the Respondent contends that the Claimant “sought to further delay the briefing
and oral argument of the matter before the Supreme Court” and “‘succe[eded] in delaying the
Supreme Court's consideration of the constitutional issue”? Final argument was held on

20 March 2012, after which the Court adjourned the matter for judgment to 16 May 2012.

329, With respect to the procedure before the Supreme Court, the Claimant notes that “except for the

aE

affidavits offered by counsel for the parties, no evidentiary hearing was held and, accordingly,

a no factual record was developed”.**°

2. The Supreme Court Judgment of 16 May 2012

330, The Supreme Court referred two issues to itself:

 

1 Whether or not the [PPA] constitutes an international business transaction within the
meaning of Article 181(5) of the Constitution.

2. Whether or not the arbitration provisions contained in clause 22.2 of the [PPA]
constitutes an international business transaction within the meaning of Article
181(5) of the Constitution."

331, Regarding the first issue referred to it, the Supreme Court concluded that the PPA “constitutes
an international business transaction within the meaning of Article 181(5) of the
Constitution“?

332. With respect to the second issue, the Supreme Court stated that the “arbitration provisions

contained in clause 22.2 of the [PPA] does not constitute an international business transaction
within the meaning of Article 181(5) of the Constitution”. However, in the same paragraph,

the Supreme Court went on to conclude that:

An international commercial arbitration draws its life from the transaction whose dispute

resolution it deals with. We therefore have difficulty in conceiving of it as a transaction

separate and independent from the transaction that has generated the dispute it is required to
58

resolve,

 

333. Ultimately, the Supreme Court remits the case to the High Court for its consideration in light of

455

this interpretation of Article 181(5) of the Constitution.” The Supreme Court also requests that

Parliament enact a Bill indicating what modifications it wishes to make to Article 181(5) of the

Constitution, stating that “{t}his step would bring greater certainty and clarity to the law.”

3. The Nature of the PPA under the Constitution of Ghana
Article 181(5) of the Constitution provides as follows:

This article shall, with the necessary modifications by Parliament, apply to an international
business or economic transaction to which the Government is a party as it applies to a loan.
At the outset, the Supreme Court found that the wording of the constitutional provision “should
not lead necessarily to the result that only agreements between entities resident abroad and the

457 4¢ went on to opine that

Ghana Government can be embraced within the meaning of the term.
ihe substance of the transaction rather than the form should prevail when the transaction is of
“such a clear international nature”, even if the party contracting with the Government is resident
in Ghana.**

Regarding the meaning of “international” in Article 181(5), the Supreme Court found it
necessary to combine “both the nature of the business or economic transaction criterion and the
parties’ criterion proposed by the plaintiff.” ae

The Supreme Court then acknowledged the “need to formulate a clear criterion for
distinguishing transactions between the Government and Ghanaian entities that fall under
Article 181(5) from others with Ghanaian entities which do not fal} in the category of Article
181(5) despite their “foreign connections.’“” Noting that the examples given by the Claimant in
its submissions illustrate “a reductio ad absurdum”, it acknowledged that “it would be
impractical for Parliament to scrutinize and approve every single business transaction with
international ramifications entered into by the Executive.” ‘

Thus, pursuant to a purposive interpretation of the Constitution, the Supreme Court found that
“there is need to imply into Article 181(5) an understanding that only major international

business or economic transactions are to be subject to its provisions”; while noting that

Supreme Court Judgment, at 30.
Supreme Court Judgment, at 31.
Supreme Court Judgment, at 31,

Supreme Court Judgment, at 31.

 

Supreme Court Judgment, at 34-35: At this stage of its analysis, the Supreme Court also rejected the
Claimant’s argument that the Article 181(5) of the Constitution was inoperative without legislative
“modifications” on the part of Parliament, based on the Faroe precedent and on a purposive interpretation
of the constitutional provision: “The framers could have hardly intended that Parliament should be able to
stultify their purpose of achieving transparency in the Executive's international business deals through
simple inaction.”

PCA 117830 105

 

 

 

 

 

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 124 of 264

Parliament should exercise its legislative power in relation to article 181(5) and clarify which

1 462

transactions are to be viewed as major.

339. The Court further elaborated on the reasons underlying its interpretation. As “one of the values
of the [Constitution] is the promotion of probity and accountability”, “’ reading in the term

“major” was in accordance with the objective purpose of the Constitution.“ Specifically, the

 

Court explained that “Parliamentary scrutiny of major transactions entered into by the Executive
is likely to be a powerful spur to probity in such transactions. That is why it is unlikely that the
framers would have intended to give to Parliament the veto power implied in the defendants’
interpretation of article 181(5).”“* At the same time, the framers of the Constitution could not
have intended “the obvious and foreseeable paralysis from overload in Parliament that would
ensue from interpreting the provision as covering every single business or economic transaction

with an international dimension”.“°°

 

340. Reiterating that it was “imperative” that Parliament give “greater certainty and clarity as to [the]

#57 the Supreme Court states that

categories of international business or economic transactions,’

“ijn the interim, a certification from the Attorney-General [before a dispute has arisen] that an

international business transaction to which the Government is a party is ‘major’ or not should be

accorded great weight by the courts."“*

341, The Supreme Court then reads into the definition of an “international” transaction the
requirement that the “nature of the business which is the subject matter of the transaction ...
{have] a significant foreign element or the parties to the transaction (other than the Government)
have a foreign nationality or reside in different countries, or in the case of companies, the place
of their central management and control is outside Ghana” with the word ‘significant’ said to

denote the qualitative assessment necessary to make the determination, where the assessment is

“in relation to the purpose of article 181(5)".4"

With respect to the purpose of Article 181(5), the Supreme Court opines that the subjective or
objective purpose of the framers of the Constitution was not to subject to Parliamentary
approval “transactions of ordinary commerce”.“”' In applying this test for “international
business transaction” to the PPA, the Supreme Court concludes that the PPA falls within the
ambit of Article 181(5). The Court further states that it viewed the term “transaction” to mean
“a series of agreements or acts united by their purpose of attaining the project objective of the
2 472

parties to it”. The Court also notes that it “view[ed] the transaction in the round, without

resorting technically to the piercing of the corporate veil doctrine”. The Court considers the

transaction in question as “a foreign investment by a US investor in a power generation
project“ based on the cumulative effect of the following five circumstances: i) The PPA
resulted from negotiations between a foreign investor (Mr. Elders) and the Government; ii) BEL.
is wholly-owned by a foreign entity; iii) the managing director of BEL is a foreigner,
Mr. Elders, “and control of the management of [this Ghanaian company] is in foreign hands”;
iv) the PPA contains an international arbitration clause; and vy) the PPA contains other clauses
“usually associated with foreign transactions, such as the waiver of sovereign immunity” and

Clause 29.2 (containing an exemption from taxes and foreign exchange controls).

(a) The Claimant’s Position

in the Claimant’s view, the PPA is legally valid. In this regard, the Claimant argues that the
Tribunal should give no weight to the Supreme Court of Ghana’s analysis of Article 181(5) of
the Constitution and its impact on the PPA.“ The Claimant also requests that the Tribunal
reconsider the determination in its Interim Award regarding the “importance of and
consideration to be given [to] the Ghanaian Supreme Court’s determination of the substantive
issues of the application of Article 181(5) of the Constitution of Ghana to the PPA”.“”° The

Claimant insists the PPA is not an international business transaction and that such a

determination “can only be made after a full evidentiary hearing on the merits” by this

Tribunal.”

‘The Claimant submits that the Supreme Court’s analysis does not take into account the totality
of the facts and circumstances engaged in this dispute, as well as the conduct of the Parties.
The Claimant argues that Article 185(5) should not apply in the absence of enabling legislation
from the Ghanaian Parliament, but rather, “the analysis should be limited to the bright line
approach originally announced by the Ghanaian Supreme Court in its Faroe opinion.” The
Claimant fi that “parties acting with the G of Ghana should not be
held ... to an after-the-fact scrutiny of the constitutionality of an agreement, acknowledged by
the Government and prosecuted by the Government for years,” as the uncertainty is due to the
Respondent's failure to seek Parliamentary approval and to clarify the application of the

constitutional provisions in question.”

In the event that the bright line test of Faroe does not apply, the Claimant submits that the
applicable test should be one of “totality of the circumstances”.**! The Claimant explains that,

“© this test involves “the identification of multiple criteria that are

as employed under U.S. law,
then accorded relative weight based upon the underlying facts and circumstances”. Applying
the “totality of the circumstances test” to the present case, the Claimant submits that “this would
involve consideration of Balkan’s place of business and the place of the parties’ performance
under the agreement”. The latter are, according to the Claimant, “well-known concepts with
clear rules and standards of interpretation,” most notably pursuant to the United Nations

Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980) (the “CISG”).“% In

The Claimant also submits that the Supreme Court’s reasoning “does not provide a definitive
criterion to employ in analyzing the facts presented by this case”."*” In this regard, the Claimant
contends that the Supreme Court’s determination of the nature of the party was limited to the
ownership aspects of Balkan and its determination of the nature of the transaction focused on
“certain limited provisions of the PPA”.“* According to the Claimant, the place of performance,
and the actual performance of the Parties, should also have been considered and accorded
greater weight under the “totality of the circumstances test”. In particular, the Claimant argues
that the Supreme Court should have considered the Claimant’s place of business (which was
Ghana since incorporation and throughout the first two years under the PPA), as well as the
place of performance (which was exclusively in Ghana).**° The Claimant draws attention to
what it considers to be an absence of any reference to either the place of business or the Parties”
performance under the PPA in the statement of facts im the Supreme Court Judgment.”
Moreover, the Claimant asserts that there is no discussion by the Supreme Court “of the
conditions precedent provisions of the PPA”, such as the Respondent's “continuing obligation
to obtain all necessary approvals under their agreement with Balkan”!

In its Post-Hearing Submission, the Claimant makes reference to two more circumstances that
the Supreme Court should have considered (and therefore the Tribunal should consider) under
the “totality of the circumstances test”. A first circumstance is the inconsistency of the Supreme
Court’s ruling with Ghanaian income tax laws." According to the Claimant, the purpose of

Asticle 181 of the Ghanaian Constitution is to promote government accountability and prevent

the executive branch from transferring the country’s limited financial resources overseas. The
Claimant points out that the PPA was concluded between Ghana and a Ghanaian entity,

meaning that any income would be taxable in Ghana.

348. The second additional circumstance that, according to the Claimant, the Tribunal must take into
account is the fact that there have been four other similar power purchase agreements between.

independent power producers and Ghana, all of which involved a “major foreign investment”,

 

Ghana chose not to take these four agreements to Parliament. Not one other agreement was the

subject of any court proceedings.’

349. Based on the foregoing, the Claimant contends that the Supreme Court Judgment should be
accorded no weight by the Tribunal on account of its reasoning being “result-oriented” and
based on undefined factors.“ The Claimant argues that “the failure of the ... Supreme Court to
offer clear criteria that do not ... beg more questions than they answer and its failure to
distinguish between the examples given and the actual facts and circumstances presented by this
case." In particular, the Claimant submits that the Supreme Court failed to identify what
criteria determine if a transaction is “major”, stating only that a certification by the Attorney

General “should be accorded great weight by the courts” in this determination.”

350. The Claimant also criticizes the Supreme Court Judgment for “ignor{ing] the fact that Balkan ...
obtained such a pre-dispute certification from the Attorney General” and queries why this

certification was not given any weight by the Supreme Court.”

351. According to the Claimant, the Supreme Court also failed to identify what criteria should be

used to ascertain whether a transaction has “a significant foreign element.”“** The Claimant
notes that the only explanation provided by the Supreme Court Judgment is in response to the
Claimant’s example of the purchase of a British Airways ticket, which the Supreme Court
observed is not international, but “in ordinary commerce.” The Claimant asserts that the

Judgment does not, however, offer any further definition or other criterion of “transactions in

ordinary commerce”.”” The Claimant further points out that the analysis of that flight ticket is
hardly reconcilable with the facts of the present case, arguing that “{iJf, as the Supreme Court
suggests, the sale of a fleet of foreign-manufactured automobiles would not be international or
major in nature, how is it that a contract which contemplates that a Ghanaian entity Jease a barge
located in Ghana and commission and operate a power station to provide power to the national
grid in Ghana under a license issued by the Government of Ghana, employing hundreds of

Ghanaians, is an international business transaction?” *°

 

352. In the Posi-Hearing Submission, the Claimant also refers to a decision issued by the Supreme
Court on 19 July 2013, in which the Supreme Court established that, in general, Article 181(5)
does not apply to agreements between foreign investors and governmental agencies. The
Claimant contends that the ratio decidendi of the Court was an argument advanced by the
Claimant in its case before the same Court, namely that “Parliament would be sucked into
unnecessary minutae if it were to have the function of approving every international business or
economic transaction.” The Claimant contends that in the Claimant’s case the Court overcame.
this difficulty by inventing the additional qualifier “major” to be applied artificially to the
constitutional concept of “international transaction”

353. The Claimant maintains that the Supreme Court did not assess the Respondent’s compliance
with the conditions precedent of the PPA and the establishment of the Effective Date. In
particular, the Claimant argues that if Article 181(5) is applicable to the PPA, the Respondent
had the obligation to seek parliamentary approval under the terms of the PPA,“ and having not

503;

done so, is in breach of the PPA,”” in particular, Clause 7.44

PPA provides as follows:

If, on or before the target dates on the Milestone Schedules (Third Schedule), or such later date
as the parties hereto may agree, the Effective Date has not occurred and the Parties agree to
terminate the Project, GoG shall reimburse and indemnify BE{L] for all costs and liabilities

party. However, if BE{L] is the defaulting party, no cost incurred shall be recovered from GoG,

Date has not occurred or that all or any of the conditions precedent set out in Clauses 7.2 and

audit with respect to any indemnity claimed by BE[L]} pursuant to this Clause 7.4 for the

4 354. In support of its claim that the Respondent is in default under the PPA, the Claimant contends
- that “for the purpose of constitutional scrutiny, the provisions of the conditions precedent and
“s compliance with Jaw section, in particular, the Respondent’s obligation to seek and obtain
‘a requisite approvals (including if necessary, parliamentary approval), are not [...] international
yi business transactions”. *”’ According to the Claimant, the contrary will lead to the reductio ad

absurdum that the Supreme Court wished to avoid, and would entail that the Respondent could

 

avoid liability for an obligation to seek approval for an agreement involving an international

business transaction by merely breaching that obligation.°

 

In this regard, the Claimant refers to the cross-examination of Ms. Gadzekpo at the hearing,
who stated in relation to the PPA that “is was [initially] a valid agreement” because “it was
performed by the parties and seen as valid,” since the Attorney General had confirmed that
the PPA did not come under the ambit of Article 181(5) of the Constitution The Claimant
denies the Respondent's assertion that the reason for the Attorney General's change of mind
was the Supreme Court's decision, as the Respondent's position that the PPA was void ab initio
was presented to the Tribunal in 2010.“” The Claimant highlights that Ms. Gadzekpo claimed

that she was entitled to change her mind about whether the PPA was valid”

356. According to the Claimant's reading, the Supreme Court Judgment did not declare the PPA to

 

be void,*"! and instead merely refers the matter back to the High Court “to dispose of the case in
accordance with this determination as far as relevant to the case before it.”*” On this basis, the

Claimant argues that the High Court could decide that the Respondent had a continuing

 

purpose of determining if the amount of the BEJL]’s claim for reimbursement has been
computed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

obligation to seek Parliamentary approval and is therefore liable in accordance with the
p58

Claimant’s request for equitable relief.
With regard to the Supreme Court’s decision, the Claimant finally contends that the wording of
Article 181(5) of the Constitution clearly suggests that the determination as to which
international transactions should be taken to the Parliament for approval may only be made by
Parliament itself, and not by the Supreme Court." The Claimant further submits that it was in
recognition of this reality that the Parliament drafted a proposal to clarify which transactions are
exempted from the requirements of Article 181(5).'° This proposal could exempt the Claimant

ex-post facto, but the Claimant points out that the document is marked as “secret.”

Finally, the Claimant contends that whatever the situation under Ghanaian domestic law might
be, the Claimant may still invoke the PPA against Ghana, as the application of Ghanaian law is
in this case conditioned by well-established principles of international law." The Claimant first
submits that the contents of the contract show that the Parties wished to have Ghanaian
municipal law applied only as conditioned by public international law.°'’ The Claimant also
maintains that these international principles must be applied (i) because the issue is addressed
in the course of an international arbitration proceeding; (2) because the rules of equity and

customary international law are among the main legal sources of the Ghanaian legal sy:

 

according to Article 11(2) of the Constitution; and (3) because {in the Claimant’s view) the
Tribunal affirmed in its Interim Award that the principles of international law governing
responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts (embodied in the ILC Articles) are

applicable to the present case.

The Claimant points to Article 7 of the ILC Articles, which it considers to embody these
principles by precluding a State from taking refuge behind provisions of its internal law. With
this in mind, the Claimant adduces the principles of good faith and the sanctity of contracts to
affirm that it was entitled to rely on the representation made by the Respondent that the PPA

was a valid and binding agreement to which no constitutional impediment applied.°*

(b) The Respondent’s Position

360. The Respondent submits that the Tribunal must follow the determination in the Supreme Court

 

Judgment and declare the PPA invalid, as well as that the Supreme Court Judgment is a final
‘a pronouncement on the issue of invalidity of the PPA. Accordingly, Balkan’s contractual claims

must be denied and the Tribunal has to decide only Balkan’s alternative non-contractual claims
519

 

for damages.

 

The Respondent submits that “the Tribunal is bound to follow the law of Ghana as applied by

yw
a

+9520

Ghana’s highest court to the PPA and hold that the PPA is void ab initio.” and that “{here is

no conceivable basis” to hold otherwise.

362. With respect to the criticism of the Supreme Court Judgment that the Claimant develops in its
Interim Submission, the Respondent submits that this “merely recycle{s] the legal positions that
{the Claimant] took, and lost, before the Supreme Court.)

363. Starting from the premise that the Tribunal is bound to apply the laws of Ghana to the issue of
validity of the PPA pursuant to Clause 23 of the PPA and Article 33 of the UNCITRAL
Rules,” the Respondent proceeds to explain why the Tribunal has to follow the Supreme Court
Judgment. First, the Parties agree that the Supreme Court of Ghana has original and exclusive
jurisdiction over all matters relating to the enforcement or interpretation of the Constitution,
pursuant to Article 130(1)(a) of the Constitution.” Additionally, arbitral ibunals do not have

power to enforce or interpret national constitutions, except for considerations of transnational

public policy inapplicable in this case.**

364. Second, relying on arbitral decisions and doctrinal sources,

365.

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 133 of 264

525

the Respondent asserts that it is a
“fundamental principle of international law and arbitration that arbitral tribunals should
recognize and defer to judgments {...] with force of res judicat.” °° It will also be beyond the
scope of the powers of the Tribunal to “disregard setUed authority if there is ‘sufficient support’
for doing so”, when it has not been empowered by the parties to arbitrate ex aequo et bono.”
Further, failure to follow the constitutional interpretation of the Supreme Court will, according
to the Respondent, be ground for refusing recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award

under Article V.2(b) of the New York Convention.

Third, the international law principle of deference to res judicata is consistent with Dutch law.
Specifically, pursuant to Article 236 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure, the Supreme Court
Judgment will be found to have the force of res judicara.* Additionally, the principle of res
judicata applies equally to an arbitration in which Dutch law is the lex loci arbitri* and
doctrinal sources emphasize the risk of setting aside an award which deviates from a preceding

wa $3
court decision?

366. The Respondent maintains that the Supreme Court Judgment is not open to future

determination. Contrary to the Claimant’s argument regarding the lack of finality of the
Supreme Court’s determination concerning the validity of the PPA, the Respondent asserts that
“[a] determination as to the validity of the PPA under the jaws of Ghana has ... been made by

99532

the Supreme Court of Ghana,”””” The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s view that remitting the

case to the High Court means that the Supreme Court Judgment is “open to further

interpretation”,* contending that a further determination by the High Court — to the effect that

the PPA is not void ab initio - would be contrary to the Constitution of Ghana and binding

precedent. *™

367. In further support of its position on finality of the Supreme Court Judgment, the Respondent
emphasizes that the Claimant did not apply for review, as it bad the right to do within one
month from the date of the judgment, pursuant to Rules 54-56 of Ghana’s Supreme Court

Rules.”

368. With respect to the constitutional constraints on the Ghanaian High Court, the Respondent
emphasizes that courts are bound to comply with the decisions of the Supreme Court. In
particular, Article 129(3) of the Constitution provides that “all other courts shall be bound to

55 and Article 130(2) provides

follow the decisions of the Supreme Court on questions of law

that “[t]he Court in which the question arose shall dispose of the case in accordance with the

decision of the Supreme Court."**”

369. With respect to binding precedent, the Respondent submits that in Faroe, a decision that the
Parties agree is still an authoritative statement of the law,** the Supreme Court “held that a
contract subject to Article 181(5) is void ab initio in all cases absent Parliamentary approval.

The Respondent emphasizes that such an agreement is unenforceable pursuant to Holding 6 of

Faroe: “{elven though the defendant had, by summary judgment been finally adjudged as

having breached the power purchase agreement, the court would refuse to award any damages

for the breach because the agreement or contract was unconstitutional for non-compliance with

article 181(5) of the 1992 Constitution."

370. The Respondent concludes that there is no authority supporting Balkan’s position that the High

sai

Court might find the PPA enforceable.” Also, with respect to the possibility of relief contended

by the Claimant, the Respondent submits that “neither the Tribunal nor the High Court could
breathe life into a contract thal is void ab initio or order the Parliament to approve the PPA even

if it were submitted to it”?

The Respondent adds that “every legal definition of void ab initio™™*

contradicts the Claimant's
argument that the PPA can be enforced by the High Court, given that the concept refers to

nullity from the moment of conclusion of the agreement.

The Respondent also seeks to counter the argument made by the Claimant at the hearing™

that
clauses 2.6, 2.7 and 18 of the PPA may survive because they cannot be considered part of an
international business transaction, According to the Respondent, the argument was rejected at
by the Supreme Court, as the definition of “international transaction” encompassed the whole

PPA, not just certain provisions.*

Finally, the Respondent contends that public international law is not applicable to the case but
only the laws of Ghana. The Respondent sees no legal basis for the application of international
law™® — it submits that the Supreme Court has unequivocally affirmed that Ghana is a dualist
state in which principles of public international law are not incorporated into the law of Ghana if
they are inconsistent with the Constitution or statutes of Ghana as interpreted by its Supreme

Court.”

(c) The Tribunal’s Findings and Conclusions on the Validity of the PPA

The Tribunal recalls that in its Interim Award on Jurisdiction it determined that the arbitration
agreement between the Parties was valid and that accordingly it had jurisdiction to decide on the
substance of this dispute under the PPA. At the same time the Tribunal expressed its highest
respect for the courts of Ghana and established a long schedule for the written submissions of
the Parties and the timing of the hearing on the merits so as to be able to take into full

consideration what the Supreme Court of Ghana could have decided on this matter in the light

of the proceedings before the courts of that country. The Tribunal must reiterate at this point its

respect for Ghanaian judicial processes.

i 375. This Tribunal could not presume to decide an issue of constitutional interpretation in Ghana

when the highest courts of the country have considered the matter under their respective

 

jurisdictions. While international arbitration is not subordinated to the views of national courts it
nonetheless can consider to the fullest extent possible how to conduct its own jurisdiction in a
framework of compatibility and not of confrontation, particularly when national courts are both
independent and professionally competent. There are cases in which these fundamental factors
are either non-existent or subject to serious doubt and then the role of international arbitration

might be different, but this is certainly not the case here.

376. From the arguments of the Parties and the judgment of the Supreme Court on this case it is not
difficult to realize that there are two aspects to be considered in succession. The first concerns
the determination of the nature of the PPA while the second concerns the effects of such

determination in the specific circumstances of this dispute. The Supreme Court rightly identified

 

that the essential determination it had to make was whether or not the PPA constitutes an

international business transaction under Article 181(5) of the Constitution, with the Court

 

having answered this question in the affirmative. The Supreme Court then proceeded to remit
the case to the High Court for its consideration in light of the interpretation made, a proceeding
which is still pending before this last court. The Supreme Court did not decide on the effects of

its determination which is a task that falls on the High Court.

377, In determining that the PPA is an international business or economic transaction for the purpose
of Article 181(5) of the Constitution, the Supreme Court also recognized that the matter had not
been free from doubt. Three determinations of the Supreme Court reflect this uncertain
situation. It first indicated in its judgment that Parliament should consider enacting a Bill
indicating what modifications it wishes to make to Article 181(5) of the Constitution so as to
provide “greater certainty and clarity to the law.” The Court then proceeded to acknowledge the
“need to formulate a clear criterion for distinguishing transactions between the Government and

’ Ghanaian entities that fall under Article 181(5) from others with Ghanaian entities which do not

fall in the category of Article 181(5) despite their foreign connection:

 

”, an acknowledgment
! which again evidences that the guiding criterion under the Constitution for the purpose of

Article 181(5) was not clear enough.

 

378. The third determination by the Supreme Court was to introduce a distinction that had not been

. expressly made in that Article so as to implicitly understand that only major international

PCA 117830 118

 

 

 

379.

380.

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 137 of 264

business or economic transactions are to be subject to the provisions of the Article in question.
In so determining the Supreme Court further noted that Parliament should exercise its legislative
power in relation to article 181(5) in order to clarify which transactions are to be viewed as
major, again evidencing in this respect that the matter was not settled. In view of this
uncertainty the Supreme Court also advised that “fiJn the interim, a certification from the
Attorney-General [before a dispute has arisen] that an international business transaction to
which the Government is a party is ‘major’ or not should be accorded great weight by the

courts.”

On examining the Supreme Court judgment here considered, this Tribunal notes that the views
held by both the Plaintiff and the Defendant before that court are plausible and could not be held
to be legally wrong. In fact, as the Court pointed out, the constitutional provision discussed
should not necessarily be read as embracing only agreements between the Government and
entities resident abroad, thus reasoning that a party resident in Ghana might be subject to the
constitutional requirement if the substance rather than the form of the transaction and other
relevant criteria shows a clear international nature of such agreement. At the same time the
Court noted that it would be impractical for Parliament to scrutinize every single wansaction
with international ramifications entered into by the Executive, the bright line separating these
different transactions being the distinction between “major” transactions and those done in

“ordinary commerce”.

There can be no doubt about the fact that the PPA embodies the existence of significant foreign
components which is what in the end convinced the Supreme Court in reaching the conclusion it
did. It is quite true that the PPA viewed as a whole, “in the round” as described by the Court,
contains several international components, such as the nature of the business and the related
investments made or the waiver by the Government of sovereign immunity, The Claimant’s
arguments as to the fact that BEL was organized as a Ghanaian company in compliance with the
applicable legislation are, however, equally true, and thus the foreign ownership of the company
or the foreign nationality of its executives should not necessarily be an obstacle to concluding
that the PPA does not qualify as the kind of agreement subject to the requirement of Article
181(5) of the Constitution. The management and control of the company does not lose its
connection to Ghana in spite of the foreign interests involved nor is this a consequence of its
owners residing abroad. As has been noted above, and as the Claimant rightly notes, this is not a
case brought under a foreign investment treaty. Doubts expressed by the Supreme Court about
the intended meaning of Article 181(5) are well taken. This Tribunal notes in particular that the

Supreme Court rightly considered the provisions of paragraph 5 in the context of Article 181 as

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 138 of 264

 

i a whole, the main concern of which, as stated in its paragraph 1, is that an agreement entered

 

into by the Government for the granting of a loan out of public funds or public accounts must be

| authorized by Parliament. Paragraph 5 then applies this requirement concerning loans to an

4 international business or economic transaction, calling Parliament to do this “with the necessary
, t modifications”. These modifications were never introduced. The provision of paragraph 5 as it
stands today could be interpreted to the effect that Parliamentary approval is required when an
international business or economic transaction is somewhat akin to a loan, which is not the case
here, or else that it would have to be specifically modified so as to apply to situations different

from a loan, which has not been done.

381.

Ghana’s Attorney General requested the Commercial Division of the High Court in Accra in
June 2010 to declare that the PPA was an international business transaction that needed
Parliamentary approval and not having obtained such approval it was thus unenforceable. This
same argument was raised by the Respondent in the arbitration proceedings with which this
Award is concerned. The Tribunal must note, however, that these views were expressed over a
year after the dispute between the Parties had arisen. Before that the issue had not been raised
and the Parties had only discussed the meaning of the PPA but had never questioned its validity.
If the materialization of the dispute can be ascertained in mid-2009. as per the facts explained
above, this would be the critical date to take into account as to the pertinence of the legal
arguments and anything thereafter must be considered as views relating rather to the litigation in

progress than to the essence of the Parties’ understandings on the PPA.

382. The arguments of the Attorney General before the Ghanaian courts have relied on the broad
definition of international arbitration under the ICC Arbitration Rules and other international
instruments, as well as on the interpretation of the English Arbitration Act 1996 and statutes on
arbitration from Singapore and Ghana, so as to establish that the nature of the PPA is
constitutive of an international business or economic transaction. While this Tribunal will
discuss the arguments concerning international arbitration further below, the issue is now moot
in view of the Supreme Court ruling in its judgment that the provisions of the PPA on this
matter do not constitute an international business or economic transaction. The conclusions of

nO this Tribunal in its Interim Award on the validity of the arbitration clause of the PPA have thus
fyi been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court, although some difference of views apparently persists

‘on the question of the arbitration clause being separate and severable from the contract.

383. The identification of a number of internationally related components of the PPA made by the

. " Attorney General and accepted by the Supreme Court do not alter the fact that the company was

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 139 of 264

incorporated in Ghana as required by the Ghanaian legislation and regulations. The case is thus
different from a situation in which a foreign company or an agency thereof operates in a certain
country without a proper legal registration therein. The Supreme Court has rightly refused in
this context to follow the Attorney General’s request to pierce BEL’s corporate veil, an
alternative that is open in case of fraud, bad faith or other irregular behavior, but which is not
the case here where no irregularities have been alleged in respect of the Claimant's

incorporation in Ghana, as the Claimant has correctly argued before that Court.

The Tribunal has also discussed above the difference between this case and one governed by the
protection of foreign investments under treaties and other international instruments. In this
context it is nonetheless noteworthy that the Attorney General has indicated the relevance of the

Ghana-UK Bilateral Investment Treat; one of the factors listed to support its argument that

 

BEL’s incorporation in Ghana is insignificant and irrelevant because the sole shareholder of
BEL is Balkan UK. While this argument is understandable in the context of arguing that the
PPA is an international business or economic transaction requiting Parliamentary approval in
spite of BEL being incorporated in Ghana, it nonetheless might lead to the conclusion that the
company could be entitled to international legal protection under that Treaty, which contradicts
the position of the Respondent that international arbitral tribunals have no jurisdiction in this

dispute.

The Tribunal is also mindful that the case Attorney-General v Faroe Atlantic Co. Lid, decided
earlier by the Supreme Court, has figured prominently in the discussion of the Parties and the
judgment of the Court. In that case the Supreme Court decided that an international business or
economic transaction includes business between the Government and a company incorporated
abroad, noting however that the fact that Parliament had not made the necessary specifications

in pursuance of Article 181(5) did not render that Article inoperable.

The Respondent asserts in this respect that as there is no constitutional provision proscribing
Ghanaian companies from entering into international business or economic transactions with the
Government the clause in question should equally apply to such Ghanaian companies. The
Claimant argues to the contrary that under relevant international conventions a transaction may
be considered international only if it meets strict criteria, such as an agreement between two or
more countries, involving parties residing in different countries or involving the crossing of
national borders, none of which are present in this case. The Claimant further asserts that none
of these elements is defined in the Constitution which cannot be then interpreted as having

settled the framework for the application of the provision without the necessary modifications.

PCA 117830 121

 

 

 

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 140 of 264

387.

388.

The Supreme Court’s interpretation of this provision is as noted above plausible but it is only
one possible alternative. The views of the Parties are equally well argued, the Court having so
recognized in stating that in determining these issues “we have been greatly assisted by the
painstaking Statements of Case filed by the Plaintiff and the Defendants”. It must also be noted
that the Court’s interpretation is largely based on the values of probity and accountability that
the drafters of Article 181 of the Constitution had emphasized, having found that in this light it
is justifiable to read into the provision the implicit requirement of it being applicable alse to

Ghanaian registered entities and not just to foreign based companies.

At this point and with due deference and respect, after having considered the Supreme Court’s
judgment in detail, the Tribunal must depart from the conclusion reached by that Court. The
Tribunal is convinced by the Claimant’s views on the need to apply a test taking into account
the “totality of the circumstances” as the guideline for determining whether a given agreement is
subject to the Constitutional provisions discussed. It is not enough to identify the foreign
components of the PPA, which as noted do exist, but also the fact that the PPA was entered into
by a Ghanaian company registered in Ghana cannot be ignored. Among other features arising
from this fact there is the evidence that BEL’s principal place of business is in this country, the
production envisaged under the PPA is to supply the domestic electrical market and payments
were to be made in Ghana, thus meaning that performance under the PPA was entirely a
domestic business. Questions of taxation in Ghana have also been invoked by the Claimant as
evidence that the business was considered a domestic venture. Moreover, even if in international
arbitration and international principles of commercial law there is a rather liberal view to
broadly consider what is to be regarded as international, this is not unlimited, as the Claimant
noted citing the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods

(1980).

The Tribunal has also noted above that Article 181 of the Constitution is inextricably related to
the question of government loans that might entail the transfer of public funds abroad, a purpose
not evidently applicable to international business or economic transactions without introducing
the necessary modifications to its paragraph 5, as envisaged under this very provision and
requested from Parliament on more than one occasion by the Supreme Court. The PPA does not
involve the transfer of funds abroad in the sense that a loan does and thus the need for
Parliamentary approval is not self-evident either. The fact noted by the Claimant to the effect
that four other similar power purchase agreements between private companies and the
Government involving some form of foreign investment have not been submitted to

Parliamentary approval by the Government, except for one made after the Balkan judgment was

PCA 117830 122

 

 

 

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 141 of 264

 

issued, suggests that the constitutional requirement is not as mandatory as it would appear at

first sight.

390, The discussion about the nature of the PPA, however, is not the end of the matter as the
Tribunal has still to determine the proper legal effects of the Supreme Court's judgment. While
for the Respondent this judgment means that the PPA is void ab initio and not enforceable, and

consequently cannot give place to an award of contractual damages, the Tribunal must note that

 

the Supreme Court did not go that far and Jeft in the hands of the High Court the disposition of
the specific dispute between the Parties. Although it is theoretically possible that the High Court

could reach a determination that the PPA is valid and enforceable, it does not appear to be likely

 

that this will be the case. The Respondent believes that the principle of res judicata would

necessarily require the High Court to follow the interpretation of the Supreme Court particularly

 

in view that under Article 130(2) of the Constitution lower courts shall dispose of the case in
accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court. The Respondent also invokes in support of
its view the fact that in Faroe the Supreme Court held that a contract subject to Article 181(5) is

| void ab initio absent Parliamentary approval.

391.

Even if that were to be the conclusion of the High Court, this Tribunal is convinced that that

 

would not necessarily dispose of the dispute between the Parties. The Claimant bas made a

convincing argument to the effect that the constitutionalily of a contractual agreement between a

 

 

party and the Government should not be subject to an after-the-event scrutiny when that
agreement has been acknowledged and prosecuted by that very Government for years,
particularly if any uncertainties are due to the Government's failure to seek any necessary
Parliamentary approval and to clarify the application of the constitutional provisions in

question.

 

392. The Tribunal recalls at this point the legal opinions issued on 26 October 2007 by Ghana’s
Minister of Justice and Attomey-General. In the first opinion it was noted that Faroe “clearly
excludes the project hereof which involves a local company in a local transaction with the
Government” and that in “light of the above a Parliamentary approval would not be required for
the effectiveness of the Agreement”. The second opinion was still more illuminating of the
Government’s view on this question as the Attorney General stated that “all acts, conditions and
things required by the laws and constitution of the Republic of Ghana to be done, fulfilled and
performed” had been indeed satisfied “in compliance with the laws and constitution of the
Republic of Ghana”. It then reached its final determination that Ghana's obligations under the

PPA “are legal and valid obligations binding on [Ghana] and enforceable in accordance with the

PCA 117830 123

 

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 142 of 264

394,

395.

terms of the Project Agreements”, further reaffirming that the “sanctity of contract is recognised
under the laws of Ghana and consequently the validity of the Project Agreements and the
binding nature of the obligations of the parties there under are constitutionally safeguarded”, In

the view of this Tribunal, Ghana cannot be heard subsequently to argue the contrary.

Irrespective of Faroe and a later decision of the Supreme Court of 19 July 2013, the latter not
being considered by the Tribunal as the Parties have not had the chance to properly discuss it at
the hearing, it is evident that the Respondent cannot ignore in the context of this dispute the
opinions issued by its highest legal officer at the time of the negotiation of the PPA. The
Respondent has argued that the fact that those opinions had to be issued indicated that there
were doubts about the legal status of the PPA under the Constitution, but even if this were the
case it is perfectly legitimate for a Party to have such doubts and request their clarification by
the proper Governmental authorities. Furthermore, in the very terms of the PPA it is the
obligation of the Respondent to obtain all necessary approvals for the implementation of the
PPA, a provision with which the Respondent has declared itself to be in full compliance. If
Parliamentary approval was not sought because rightly or wrongly it was believed unnecessary,
the Respondent's failure to seek Parliamentary approval of the PPA cannot be held today
against the Claimant. The question is governed not only by principles of estoppel but by

fundamental considerations of good faith.

While the Parties disagree on whether international! Jaw applies to the merits of the dispute, the
Tribunal considers that the issue here is different for under both international law and the
domestic law of Ghana, as emphasized by the second opinion of the Attorney General, it is a
well recognized general principle of Jaw that no party can take advantage of its own wrong-

doing or omission to the detriment of the rights and interests of another party.

The Tribunal notes that the Government had at all relevant times before the commencement of
litigation understood and assured the Claimant that the PPA did not require Parliamentary
approval and that this view was specifically certified to the Claimant prior to the conclusion of
the PPA. The Tribunal also notes that submission of the PPA to Parliament for consideration
and approval could only be at the instance of the Respondent and the Claimant had no role or
competence in the matter. The Tribunal further notes the request of the Supreme Court that
Parliament should clarify which agreements having the nature of international business and
commercial transaction are required to be submitted to Parliament for approval, and the
Supreme Court’s suggestion that, pending such clarification, a certification by the Attorney

General, given before litigation has commenced, on whether the nature of a transaction falls or

397.

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 143 of 264

does not fall under Article 181(5) of the Constitution, should be given great weight by the
courts. In the view of the Tribunal, this is what the Attorney General did in 2007 before the PPA

was concluded.

The outcome of the Supreme Court’s decision, and the Parliamentary clarification suggested by
the Court, might well result in the need to submit future agreements similar to the PPA to
Parliament for approval but, in the view of the Tribunal, this cannot derogate retroactively from
the legitimate rights and expectations of a party, especially where such party is acting on the
basis of a considered view of the Government solemnly given at the time when the agreement
was being negotiated. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not consider that it is sustainable to argue
that the PPA can be so affected ab initio. Such a position would be difficult to explain in legal

terms.

On the basis of the above considerations the Tribunal concludes that, in the particular
circumstances of this case, the Claimant had reasonable expectation that the Respondent had
accepted the validity of the Agreement and was, therefore, entitled to rely on the PPA and (o
expect that the Respondent would fulfill the obligations that it had assumed thereunder. In this
connection the Tribunal observes that the principle that a reasonable and legitimate expectations
of a party can give rise to a benefit that cannot be denied to that party is a well-acknowledged

principle of the common law and is, as such, part of the laws of the Republic of Ghana.

BURDEN OF PROOF
(a) The Respondent’s Position

Pursuant to Sections 12 and 17 of Ghana’s Evidence Decree, 1976 and the Ghanaian decision,
Majolaghe vy. Larbi & Ors, the Respondent submits that, under Ghanaian law, the party
asserting a fact has the burden of producing evidence to prove that fact; the burden of proof
requires proof by a “preponderance of probabilities.” The Respondent submits that Article
24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules also provides that each party has the burden of proving the fact

550

relied on to support its claim or defense.” Thus, according to the Respondent, the Claimant has

the burden of proving that it fulfilled all the necessary conditions to justify Tolling Fees under

 

 

Majolagbe v,. Larbi & Ors. [1959] G.L.R. 190 (“Majolagbe”), at 192, cited at Statement of Defense,

Clause 11.9 of the PPA, as well as the burden of proving all of the facts which support its other

«58
damages claims.

(b) The Claimant’s Position

i
J

re 399. The Claimant objects to the Respondent’s reliance on Ghana’s Supreme Court decision in

Majolagbe for the burden of proof. emphasising instead that it is the Arbitration Agreement, the

UNCITRAL Rules and the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration

 

(2010) that inform the applicable burden of proof in these proceedin;

 

(c) The Tribunal’s Findings on the Burden of Proof

400. The Tribunal finds no difficulty in concluding that Respondent’s arguments are correct in
respect of the issue of the burden of proof. Under any relevant rule governing evidence a party
thal asserts a fact must prove it. The question here is whether, as the Respondent argues, the
“preponderance of probabilities” is the appropriate test to satisfy the evidentiary requirements or
a more stringent standard should apply. Given the uncertainties surrounding some of the facts of
this case as examined above, particularly in respect of the technical elements required to set the
Power Station in operation, the Tribunal considers that the “preponderance of probabilities” test
will serve as a guideline to establish whether an argument concerning a fact or a situation is

more likely than the other.

401.

In any event, even if the 2010 IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence that the Claimant maintains
are to be relied on is considered the appropriate guideline, it must be noted that its main
evidentiary requirements are satisfied in this case. The Parties have produced abundant
documenis, witnesses have been called to testify, experts have made their reports and the
evidentiary hearing exhausted all possible angles to establish whether a certain fact has or has
not been proved so as to convince the Tribunal in reaching its conclusions on the merits. It must |
also be kept in mind that, as the Parties have invoked contrasting constructions of fact to support
their respective arguments about the discharge of obligations under the PPA, it is for each Party
to provide convincing evidence of the facts relied on. It is accordingly not just for the Claimant
t to prove its claim but also for the Respondent to prove its own assertions that it has complied

with the obligations under the PPA.

The Parties have made important evidentiary arguments based on the facts that came to light as
a consequence of discovery in the ProEnergy litigation. The Tribunal must note in this respect
that it is not its function to rely on the proceedings of a separate dispute between BEL and
ProEnergy, one of its principal subcontractors, which was submitted to the United States’
courts. The fact, however, that the Respondent has obtained access to such proceedings and
their supporting documents by means of a document production request submitted to and
granted by that jurisdiction, and that these documents have been introduced in the record of this
arbitration, provides justification for the Tribunal to consider some of the allegations made in

that other litigation if they shed light on the facts of the dispute before it.

The ProEnergy litigation was settled and some information on this agreement has been provided
by the Claimant in response to the Tribunal’s request to explain whether ProEnergy has any

% . we vcuapt on 583
financial interest in this arbitration“

In the Respondent’s view, the information provided does
not reflect the complete terms of such settlement and from the attachments produced it can be
seen that there are financial interests involved, which, the Respondent argues, cast doubt on the

testimony of a witness presented by the Claimant?

THE CLAIMANT’S BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM

Pursuant to Clause 23 of the PPA, Ghanaian law governs this claim.“ The Claimant submits
that the basic applicable tenets of contract law are set out in Ghana’s Supreme Court Opinion
Ghana Ports and Harbors Authority v. Issoufou (1993-1994), which in turn relies on the
English Court of Appeal decision in Denmark Productions Ltd. v. Boscobel Productions Ltd."

558 The Claimant reproduces lengthy excerpts from these decisions in its Statement of Claim.

According to the Claimant, its version of the facts “chronicles a phenomal [sic] level of
achievement on behalf of BE[L] ... and its commissioning efforts”, including the achievement

of FSNL. Taking into account the totality of its performance under the PPA, the Claimant

states that Clause 7.3 of the PPA “clearly provides that any delays by BE{L] ... in meeting
milestone target dates that are caused by [Ghana’s] inability to provide ‘start up electricity’ shall
result in a day to day delay in the completion date of the Power Station”.*' The Claimant
further asserts that since “start-up electricity” necessarily includes both site electricity and grid
connectivity (citing Clauses 2.5, 2.8, 3.3, and the Fourth Schedule in support), then “not one day

has yet run” on its “milestone schedule or toward the completion date”.

i. Entitlement to Tolling Fees Under Clause 11.9 of the PPA

For convenience, the Tribunal restates the particulars of Clauses 11.4 and 11.9 of the PPA,
which will be referred to in the Parties’ arguments under this issue, as well as under the issue of

grid connectivity, below.

Under Clause 11.4, BEL is entitled to Tolling Fees for each month following “the Completion

Date”.** The Completion Date is defined in the PPA as

the day upon which both parties certify that the Power Station, capable of operating in
accordance with the Operating Parameters, has successfully completed its testing and
commissioning. However, if BE[L] has completed its tests and [Ghuna’s] infrastructure is
not ready, the Completion Date shall be deemed to have occurred.***

  

   

Clause 11.9 of the PPA provides that Tolling Fees are payable to BEL if it is “unable to
commence testing of the Power Station (on the date nominated by BEL) as a result of [Ghana’s]
failure to provide an adequate Transmission Line and interconnection facilities for the Power

Station”; it goes on to state that

then in any of such events, [Ghana] shall be obligated to commence making payments of
Tolling Fees to BE{L] on the thirtieth (30") day after BE[L] certifies to [Ghana] that the
Power Station is complete or would have been complete except for the nonperformance as
listed in (i) above. The capacity for the purposes of calculating the Tolling Fees payable
under this Clause shall be deemed to be the Nominal Capacity **

{a) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant maintains that it is entitled to Tolling Fees under the PPA because “as early as

October or November of 2008, but without a doubt by the completion of the [FSNL] milestones

Tolling Fees under [Clause] 11.9.5

410, In its Reply, the Claimant denies the Respondent's assertion that the Claimant has not provided

i

any documentary evidence in this arbitration to support its claim to Tolling Fees. The Claimant

relies on the principle in the Majolagbe decision which states that averments should be

 

supported by evidence where such corroborating evidence should exist. The Claimant further
asserts that “the Respondent has failed to clear the hurdle it sets for itself." The Claimant
asserts that the Respondent’s Statement of Defense “offers scant reference to authorities or prior

precedent”.***

4li.

In its Post-Hearing Submission, the Claimant reviews the documentary evidence that supports
its claims for Tolling Fees, namely the money expended, the daily logs and the periodic
reports,*”* several pictures of the Barge obtained from both Parties*”' and the certifications
provided by Ansaldo.””” With regard to the latter, the Claimant points to three letters written by
Messrs. Pierantonio Savio and Marco Squadrone that certify that the PPA Ciause 11.9 milestone

was achieved.°”

np

Finally, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s assertion that it is not liable under Clause 11.9
PPA because BEL lacked the qualification to embark upon the commissioning efforts and
because it undertook an unrealistic time schedule to commission the Barge. The Claimant
contends that all of its workers and subcontractors had the necessary expertise to fulfill their
commitments.*”* While the Claimant concedes that the schedule was aggressive, the Claimant
maintains that, had the Respondent performed its obligations on time, it would not have been

overly ambitious."

(b) The Respondent’s Position

413. According to the Respondent, the Claimant must demonstrate a right to be paid Tolling Fees

eh

 

 

under Clauses 11.4 or 11.9 of the PPA” The Respondent asserts that the evidence presented by

the Claimant fails to demonstrate such a right." The Respondent further asserts that, “with one

of its two turbines in disrepair, there is no way that Balkan can claim the Power Station was

ready for Final Testing and Commissioning, or that Balkan is entitled to Tolling Fees under

Clause 11.9 of the PPA.”*”* In particular, the Respondent argues that the Parties never jointly
certified that the Power Station is capable of operating in accordance with the Operating
579

Parameters, defined in the PPA.”” and that the Claimant fails to present evidence of such joint

certification.”

414. With respect to Clause 11.4 of the PPA, the Respondent counters that the Claimant has failed to
present any evidence that it successfully completed its testing and commissioning of the critical
systems on the Barge, either by the Effective Date of the PPA (March 2008) or thereafter.
The Respondent asserts that the Claimant ignored Clause 6.1 of the PPA, which provides as
follows:

BE[L} shall give to [Ghana] not less than fourteen (14) days’ notice, or such lesser period
as the parties hereto may agree of its intention to commence any testing and
commissioning. ...[Ghana] shall provide assistance to BE[L] to obtain any permit or other
Governmental Approval required for testing and commercial operation of the Power
Station.”

415. The Respondent further submits that the Claimant has not produced any tests demonstrating that
the Power Station systems were successfully tested against the Operating Parameters. *

Specifically, the Respondent asserts that the FSNL tests submitted by the Claimant are

 

incomplete and do not demonstrate that the Turbines were capable of performing within

584

Operating Parameters set forth in the PPA. The Respondent argues that the Claimant also fails

including the generator, the Substation, the fuel handling facilities and delivery systems, the fire
protection system, the relay protection system, the MicroSCADA, the water cooling system and

the cathode protection system.*

‘With respect to its obligations under Clause 11.9 of the PPA, the Respondent asserts that it
provided an adequate Transmission Line (as defined by the Fourth Schedule of the PPA), which
it energised on 8 August 2008, “at least three months before Balkan began charging Tolling
Fees in November 2008”.** The Respondent further submits that the Claimant has provided no
evidence that the Power Station systems “were ready for Final Testing and Commissioning but

o> 587

for Grid Connectivity as of November 2008 or any time thereafter”.””’ In its Rejoinder, the

Respondent emphasizes that “once the Government energized this line, Balkan’s ability to claim
Tolling Fees under Clause 11.9 was extinguished."

The Respondent argues that the Claimant has not produced documents sufficiently establishing
its entitlement to Tolling Fees under the PPA, and it has therefore failed, on a “preponderance
of the probabilities”, to satisfy the burden of proof prescribed under Ghana’s Evidence Decree,
1975 and the landmark Ghanaian case, Majolagbe v. Larbi & Ors” The Respondent further
asserts that what documentary proof does exist demonstrates that the commissioning was never
completed, the Turbines were damaged and other critical systems were inoperable.*”" In support,
the Respondent relies on the ProEnergy Litigation documents, wherein Balkan US details
ProEnergy’s failures at length; failures which the Respondent argues are wholly inconsistent
with the Claimant’s claim in this arbitration that it is entitled to Tolling Fees from 1 November
2008 forward and that the Barge was ready for Final Testing and Commissioning as of
28 October 2008.

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent asserts that “[e]ven if the Supreme Court had held the PPA to

be valid, Balkan has still failed to demonstrate any right to Tolling Fees under Clause 11.9 of

Respondent is of the view that the Claimant “fails both tests”.

Further, the Respondent submits that, in its Reply, the Claimant “continues to proffer excuses
purporting to justify its refusal to connect to the National Grid on August 8, 2008 when the
Essiama Transmission Line was energized”. The Respondent asserts that the Claimant’s
“excuses” are without merit and that the Tribunal need not consider the Claimant’s arguments in
this regard because, as the ProEnergy Litigation documents show, the Claimant never reached
the stage in the commissioning process where it could have connected the Power Station to the
Essiama Transmission Line when it was energised (or for that matter the Elubo Transmission
Line when it was energised three months later).°°°

In particular, the Respondent asserts that the ProEnergy documents demonstrate the Claimant’s
“ongoing failure to commission the 16] kV electrical system”, which the Respondent contends
“had to be completed and tested before the Power Station could be connected to the National
Grid; and that the Claimant “failed to reach commissioning milestones for other critical

power generation systems for which no grid connectivity is required”. *”

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent contends that the Claimant also failed to demonstrate that it
was prevented from commissioning other systems for which no grid connectivity was
required." In particular, the Respondent draws support from the Expert Report of Parsons
Brinckerhoff, which opines that “[iJt is only absolutely necessary to have a connection to the
161 kV Transmission Lines that are part of the National Grid in the seventh and eighth
commissioning stages.” The Report explains that “{t]he [National] Grid connection then

complete Power Station,
The Respondent further asserts that the Claimant: (i) failed to achieve mechanical testing of the
Turbines at FSNL; Gi) intentionally misrepresented the condition of the Turbines and the
generators to the Respondent at the time the Transmission Lines were energised; and (iii) has
failed to provide documentary evidence verifying that it successfully commissioned still other
systems, such as the DCS, the Turbines’ controls and panels, the two generators and associated

phase isolated bus ducts and the Turbines’ rotor blades.

(ec) The Tribunal’s Findings on Claimant’s Entitlement to Tolling Fees

The examination of the facts concerning the state of the Power Station at the Barge at the time
the dispute between the Parties erupted by mid-2009 shows, as discussed above, that the real
situation was far from what the Claimant describes as evidence of a “phenomal [sic] level of
achievement on behalf of BE[L] ... and its commissioning efforts.” Phenomenal efforts were
indeed done to get the Power Station to a satisfactory operating condition, but these were not on
the whole successful. In particular the Tribunal is mindful of the discussion concerning
achievement of FSNL, which in spite of those efforts was never attained at a sustainable level
lasting beyond seconds or minutes before the system broke down. As will be discussed below, it
is true as Claimant asserts that there were repeated problems with the Respondent's provision of
start up electricity and these no doubt caused added difficulties and partial delays, but the
Tribunal does not find that these were inextricably related to a delay so major as to prevent the
testing and commissioning of the Power Station indefinitely. What the evidence does indicate,
however, is that the Claimant appears not to have done an adequate due diligence of the state of
the equipment on site when making its technical reports at the time of the negotiation of the

PPA and submitting its proposal for a ninety-day completion of the commissioning process.

The delay of the completion date envisaged under Clause 7.3 of the PPA, which could be
triggered by the lack of electricity, has not been shown to have had a causal connection with

such problems. The fact that the Power Station has not been tested and commissioned so as to

be ready to supply electricity to the National Grid until this very day is due rather to the
technical and mechanical failures of the Barge, including the fact noted by the Respondent
regarding the state of disrepair of one of the Turbines, which proves that critical milestones
could not be achieved irrespective of the lack of adequate supply of site electricity and grid
connectivity. The Claimant’s argument that “not one day has yet run” on its milestone schedule
or toward the completion date because of Respondent's failure to satisfy its obligations does not

find support in the facts set out above.

A convincing argument in this respect is that, as the Respondent points out, the Claimant’s view
that it was entitled to charge Tolling Fees since July 2008 because it had achieved the milestone
of “First Fire” at that time is contradicted by Mr, Elders’ deposition of 1 March 2010 in the
ProEnergy litigation, in which it was asserted that the subcontractor was in breach of contract as

a result of igence and ine with the that the issioning of the

 

Barge was not even close to completion.

It is also significant that there is an essential requirement associated to the Completion Date
under Clause 11.4 of the PPA which has not been satisfied. The Clause provides that it is for
both parties to certify that the Power Station is capable of operating in accordance with the
Operating Parameters and has successfully completed its testing and commissioning. This joint

certification was never done.

The Claimant has also argued that since Ghana failed to provide the adequate Transmission Line
and interconnection facilities for the Power Station it was unabje to commence testing and it is
accordingly entitled to charge Tolling Fees under Clause 11.9 of the PPA. The Claimant asserts
that it fulfilled conditions precedent to the Tolling Fees under this Clause in October or
November 2008 and certainly on reaching PSNL in 2009. The Tribunal has no reason to doubt
that monies were spent by the Claimant, great efforts were made, reports produced and pictures
shot, as documentary evidence shows, but these are not conclusive as to the state of the Barge or
that it has reached the stage of commissioning. The joint certification is still the decisive
element missing. The Tribunal, moreover, is not convinced of the accuracy of Ansaldos’s
certification. The letters written by Messrs. Savio and Squadrone certifying that the Clause 11.9
milestone had been achieved do not find support in relevant tests and are squarely contradicted
by the documentation in the ProEnergy litigation. The continuous quarrelling between the
Claimant and its subcontractors also does not help to establish that progress at the Barge was
satisfactory, and in any event shows, as the Respondent notes, that the time schedule indicated

by the Claimant was unrealistic. Despite the Claimant having notified the relevant authorities of

Ghana that testing and commissioning would be ready on 28 October 2008 and supply of power

could begin on 1 November 2008, this proved not to be a feasible proposition.

Although little in this case appears to be characterized by absolute certainty. in relying on the
“preponderance of the probabilities” test suggested by the Claimant as governing the burden of
proof the Tribunal can only conclude that the conditions precedent for the charging of Tolling
Fees were not met. As the Respondent maintains, the Claimant never reached the stage in the
commissioning process where it could have connected the Power Station to the transmission
lines, Various systems associated to the mechanical testing of the turbines at FSNL, including
some not dependent upon connection to the Transmission Lines, could not achieve
commnissioning either. The Tribunal finds that on the whole the Expert Report of Mr, Parsons
Brinckerhoff is credible as reflecting the true state of the situation of the Power Station,
including the fact that connection to the Transmission Lines is only necessary at the late stages

of commissioning in order to conduct Performance Testing of the complete Power Station.

2, Entitlement to Incidental Damages

The Claimant further claims incidental damages. These claims turn on the Parties’ disagreement
as to whether the Respondent provided the Claimant with adequate site electricity and grid

connectivity to enable commissioning, as owed under the PPA.

(a) Difficulties Related to Site Electricity

i. The Claimant's Position

5 As a result

The Claimant contends that it required a capacity of 2,000 kVa for site electricity.
of this alleged deficiency in power supply, the Claimant argues that, in March 2008, it was

forced to purchase a 1,000 kVa transformer costing USD 30,000."

The Claimant's Reply does not address the Respondent’s assertion that the Claimant is not
entitled to incidental damages relating to site electricity, grid connectivity, the RTU /

MicroSCADA or the Letter of Credit.”

ii, | The Respondent's Position

432. The Respondents position is that it complied with its obligation under Clause 2.5 of the PPA to

provide site electricity to the Barge.” It asserts that from the Effective Date of the PPA, it ran a

609)

33 kV lines from the local electricity distribution network to the Barge.” The Respondent

 

submits that the Claimant “confusingly runs several concepts together” in order to suggest that

it did not in fact provide adequate site electricity." According to the Respondent, the

ws
¥
i
Be

Claimant’s real complaint appears to be that there was only a 200 kVA transformer on site when
it took over the Barge.*"’ In this regard, the Respondent submits that if the Claimant concluded
it needed additional transformers on site, under Clause 2 of the PPA, it had the obligation to
acquire the equipment at its own cost; which the Respondent emphasizes the Claimant concedes

it did in March 2008.”

433. The Respondent also argues that the damages sought by the Claimant for the alleged breach of
the obligation on the Respondent to provide site electricity are costs attributable to the Claimant
under the PPA.°” Specifically, the Respondent cites Clauses 3.3(i), 9.2, 2.1, 2.2 and 3.1 of the
PPA in support of its assertion that the costs of fuel are to be borne by the Claimant, as well as
the cost of any equipment that BEL required on site to commission the Power Station (generator
and transformers included).

434, To counter the Claimant’s contention that it required a capacity of 2,000 kVA, the Respondent
refers to an e-mail dated 14 December 2007 from Mr. Elders to ProBnergy (obtained in the
ProEnergy Litigation discovery), wherein he stated that 350 kVA of site electricity was
sufficient for ProEnergy to do its job, thereby refusing ProEnergy’s request for additional

ots

generators to provide site electricity.° Similarly, the Respondent refers to Mr, Elder’s

deposition in the ProEnergy Litigation, in which he testified that the Claimant provided power

“way beyond what [ProEnergy] asked”. The Respondent submits that while the Claimant
contends in this arbitration that inadequate. or unreliable site electricity prevented it from
commissioning the Power Station within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date (thus by
10 March 2008), in the ProEnergy Litigation, Balkan US claimed that ProEnergy could indeed
have completed the Power Station by that date.’ The Respondent also highlights the
Claimant’s affirmation that the generators it purchased compensated any shortfalls in site
electricity from the 33 kV line.*'S

The Respondent further notes that the Barge, as equipped by its manufacturer Ansaldo, came

with a 2,800 KVA Black Start Generator, capable of a 250 kW emergency load in the event
619

Alternatively, the Respondent asserts that even if the Tribunal finds that there was insufficient
site electricity when the Claimant commenced work, it would still not excuse the Claimant’s
failure to complete the work, as, pursuant to Clause 7.3 of the PPA, any delay in providing site

620

electricity resulted in a day-to-day extension of the Completion Date. * Accordingly, the

even if the Completion Date were extended by 90 working days from March 2008 when
Balkan claims it purchased the generator to supply site electricity, or from May 2008 when.
it claims the Government resolved the problem, [BEL] would still have been obligated to
have the Power Station ready for Final Testing and Commissioning by October 2008."

iii. The Tribunal’s Findings on the Provision of Site Electricity

The Tribunal has concluded above on examining the facts concerning the supply and
availability of site electricity that the Claimant’s complaints about Respondent’s discharge of

this obligation have merit. What is not quite clear is which power capacity is required for the

Barge’s needs. The Claimant argues that it needed a capacity of 2,000 kVa for site electricity
and that it had to purchase in 2008 a 1,000 kVa transformer at a cost of USD 30,000. The

Respondent maintains that it had made available as from the Effective Date of the PPA a 33 kV

 

622

line, with stated capacity of 6,000 kVa when transformed,°~ from the local electricity

 

distribution network to the Barge, and with this, it had complied with its obligations under

Clause 2.5 of the PPA.

“ 438. The Parties’ discussion on this matter is inseparable from their views concerning the question of
the transformers and generators on sile. As argued by the Respondent, the Claimant's real
complaint appears to be that there was only a 200 kVA transformer on site when it took over the
Barge. However, the Tribunal notes the Respondent's argument to the effect that in Mr. Elder’s
deposition in the ProEnergy litigation he attested that the Claimant provided power “way

beyond what [ProEnergy] asked.”

439, The Tribunal has also noted in discussing the facts of this matter that while there is no doubt
that the Respondent supplied site electricity, the Claimant’s view that this was faulty because of
the interruptions that continuously affected that supply is credible. This is what made the

purchase of the generators inevitable as the Claimant had to compensate for those shortfalls.

440. The Respondent argues that it is the Claimant’s obligation under Clause 2 of the PPA to acquire
the necessary equipment at its own cost, citing also the provisions of Clauses 3.3(i), 9.2, 2.1, 2.2
and 3.) of the PPA in support of its assertion that the costs of fuel are to be borne by the
Claimant, as well as the cost of any equipment that BEL required on site to commission the
Power Station. including generators and transformers. However, this does not mean that these
provisions can be used as an excuse for the defective supply of site electricity which is a clearly
an obligation of the Respondent. Hence to the extent that such additional equipment was
necessary to compensate for the defective supply, the Respondent is liable for its cost and any

incidental damages.

441, This conclusion must be related to the conclusion that the Tribunal reached above on the fact
a : that the Claimant could not finalize the testing and commissioning of the Power Station at any

: relevant time. Although the Claimant asserts that this was due, among other factors, to the lack

 

Prey of supply of adequate site electricity, the Tribunal has not found a causal relationship between
y : such defects in the electricity supply and the Claimant’s inability to comply with its main

obligation under the PPA, which was due to different reasons. Jt cannot be doubted that the

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 157 of 264

shortages in site electricity caused delays in the commissioning process, but these were not
impediments to the necessary progress that ought to have been made in the ninety-days
following the Effective Date, particularly if BEL believed, as claimed in the ProEnergy

litigation, that the subcontractor could have completed the Power Station by that date.

In any event, as the Respondent notes, the Claimant maintained in the ProEnergy litigation that
the generators it purchased compensated for any shortfalls in site electricity from the 33 kV line.
As noted above, in an e-mail dated 14 December 2007 to ProEnergy, Mr, Elders stated that
350 kVA of site electricity was sufficient for ProEnergy to do its job, and consequently refused
ProEnergy’s request for an additional generator to provide site electricity, While it can be
assumed that occasional shortages could be corrected with generators coming into operation
their use would not be on the whole an adequate substitute for a fully reliable supply of site
electricity. But even then it is difficult to argue as Claimant does that testing and commissioning
were indefinitely delayed because of this reason, for even if electricity problems could have
caused some degree of disruption this could have been corrected by the day-to-day extension of
the Completion Date as envisaged in Clause 7.3 of the PPA. It is also to be noted that in the
Respondent’s argument the Barge, as equipped by its manufacturer Ansaldo, came with a
2,800 kVA Black Start Generator, capable of a 250 kW emergency load in the event electricity

from the grid was not available.

(b) Difficulties Related to Grid Connectivity
i. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant asserts that the Respondent failed to provide grid connectivity and, that this
failure made it impossible for it to perform a final test on the critical systems and commission
the Power Station. The Claimant states that the Respondent agreed to provide BEL with a
transmission line knowing that it would not be ready by the agreed date (31 December 2007).°*
it further contends that although the Elubo transmission line, which the Respondent claims
could provide grid connectivity starting on 8 August 2008, was energised it was nonetheless not

ready, and an attempt to energise it resulted in a general fault of the line. Finally, the Essiama

 

line required modificati ibration and coordination of the relay p

with the Elubo line to provide grid connectivity to the Barge.”* On the whole, the Claimant
alleges that this lack of grid connectivity entitles it to Tolling Fees from the Respondent,

pursuant to Clause 11.9 of the PPA.

ii. The Respondent's Position

 

444, The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s allegations regarding grid connectivity are

e
f
i.

‘ contradicted by the written record.’ The Respondent asserts that adequate grid connectivity
has been available since August 2008, hence, the Claimant's purported entitlement to Tolling
Fees under Clause 11.9 of the PPA “is without merit since that clause only permits Balkan to
charge Tolling Fees if the systems and the Barge are already complete but the Government has

failed ‘to provide an adequate Transmission Line’”.*
445. As detailed in the Statement of Facts above, the Respondent points to its letter to the Claimant
dated 28 July 2008, wherein it advised that the 161 kV Transmission Line was in place to

connect the Power Station to the National Grid, pursuant to Clause 2.8 of the PPA,” the Fourth
630

 

Schedule ° and, most importantly, the Grid Connection Process Agreement *! ® The
Respondent further refers to the subsequent exchanges between the Parties dated 29 August and
12 August 2008, in which the Claimant expressed its alleged concerns for why the Transmission
Line could not yet be energised and, in turn, the Respondent replied that there was no obstacle
to energizing the Line.“ According to the Respondent, the Essiama and Elubo Transmission
Lines were in good condition and were energised “well before Balkan (a) completed the 161 kV

electrical system on the Power Station, (b) rectified what it claimed were the substantial

inadequacies it found when ProEnergy left the Project Site at the end of October 2008, or (c)

first achieved what it claims was a firing of the turbines up to FSNL in March and July 2009.

Accordingly, the Respondent submits that, by 8 August 2008, 365 MVA, “the maximum output
of the Power Station, as per the requirements specified in the Fourth Schedule to the PPA for
the Transmission Line” was “energized and in service ready for connection to the Barge”. As
bonus grid connectivity, in addition to this “adequate Transmission Line”, the Respondent says
8.0%

it energised the Elubo Transmission Line to Tower 3 on 13 November 200! Moreover, the

Respondent contends that the Claimant “has refused to allow the Government to enter the
Project Site to energise either Transmission Line from Tower 3 to the Barge”.

According to the Respondent, the ProEnergy Litigation documents also show that, upon the
Government energizing the Transmission Line, the Claimant became concerned that the
Government “could ‘call a default’” on account of the failure of BEL and ProEnergy to

complete the refurbishment of the Power Station on schedule.°*

iii. The Tribunal’s Findings in Respect of Grid Connectivity

The Parties’ discussions on the guestion of grid connectivity mirror to a meaningful extent their
discussions on site electricity. For the Claimant the lack of adequate grid connectivity is one
further cause that prevented it from achieving the final testing and commissioning of the Power
Station, while the Respond intains that it duly discharged its obligations under the PPA by

enabling the Transmission Lines properly energised with enough anticipation.

. The Tribunal has no doubt about the fact that the Essiama and the Elubo Transmission Lines
were energised by the times indicated by the Respondent, beginning in August 2008. The
Respondent’s letter to the Claimant dated 28 July 2008 shows that the 161 kV Transmission
Line required to connect the Power Station to the National Grid was in place. Maintenance and
reparation works on the lines was also done following the concerns expressed by the Claimant
on the readiness of such lines. As the Respondent notes, all these tasks were completed well

before BEL had installed the 161 kV electrical system on the Power Station and rectified the

problems found when ProEnergy left the Project Site at the end of October 2008, just as it was

in anticipation of what the Claimant describes was the firing of a turbine at FSNL.

The Tribunal thus finds that the Respondent’s assertion that by 8 August 2008 the line required
for the 365 MVA transmission, the maximum output of the Power Station, was energised and in
service ready for connection to the Barge is credible, as also is the explanation that it energised
the Elubo Transmission Line to Tower 3 on 13 November 2008. Additional difficulties arose
between the Parties concerning the work to energise either Transmission Line from Tower 3 to

the Barge, which has also been a matter of reciprocal complaints.

That the lines were energised does not mean, however, that they were exempt from problems.
The Claimant’s arguments to the effect that at points there were general faults of the line, with
particular reference to the Elubo Transmission Line, or that various modifications, recalibrations
and coordination of the relay protection of the Essiama line with the Elubo line were necessary
is equally credible. As noted, most of the reparation and maintenance work of the lines,
including the problems of jungle overgrowth, were prompted by the Claimant's expressions of

concern in thal respect.

But, as was also concluded in respect of site electricity, the difficulties caused by these
problems do not have a causal relationship with the fact that the Power Station was not ready for
final testing and commissioning at any relevant point in time. As it was concluded above, this
situation finds its roots in other factors that cannot be attributed to the Respondent. From the
ProEnergy Litigation documents made available by the Respondent it appears that the Claimant
was aware that the Government might have considered calling a default on account of the
failure of BEL and ProEnergy to complete the refurbishment of the Power Station on schedule,
a consideration that would have been hardly possible if the reason for such failure was
attributable to the Respondent’s failure to provide adequate Transmission Lines in working
condition. To the extent, however, that the difficulties caused by the Transmission Lines
resulted in expenditures and delays for the Claimant they could well lead to incidental damages

due to the Claimant, a matter to be considered further below.

(ce) The RTU

Much of the Parties’ argument relating to “grid connectivity”, in turn, centers on the condition
and availability of the RTU / MicroSCADA, and in particular the question of which party had
the responsibility to commission this system and whether the RTU/MicroSCADA was a pre-

requisite to establishing grid connectivity.

i. Boundary Definitions

The respective responsibilities of the Parties are laid out in the definitions section of the PPA,

which provide, in part, as follows:

“Dead End Tower” shall mean the last tower on the Site or such other points as may be
agreed upon by the Parties.

“Delivery Point" shall be the dead end tower where responsibilities for the equipment by
[Ghana] and the BE[L] are demarcated,

“Transmission Line’* means the 161 kV voltage transmission line(s), transmission towers,
substations and other items necessary to transmit electricity from the outgoing gantry of the
switching facility within the Site to the National Grid as further described and having the
specifications set out in the Fourth Schedule.

The Claimant’s Position

455,

The Claimant relies on the definition of the “Dead Tower” under the PPA and, in particular, that
it may be defined by “such other points as may be agreed upon by the Parties." According to
the Claimant, the Parties agreed upon such other point as including the RTU because it is

implicitly part of the Transmission Line.”

The Respondent's Position

456.

457.

The Respondent contends that since the RTU is located on the Barge, and the Respondent's
responsibility for providing equipment ends at the Dead End Tower outside of the Barge," that
responsibility for the RTU necessarily falls to the Claimant. In the Respondent's view, the
Claimant’s argument that the RTU is part of the Transmission Line is “incorrect” because the
“function of the RTU is to control and monitor equipment on the Power Station”.

In the alternative, even if the Tribunal were to find that the RTU was part of the Transmission
Line, because the RTU is located in the Substation’s control room on the Barge, the RTU would
nevertheless be outside the area where the definition says the Transmission Line terminates

(“from the outgoing gantry”).°*

458. In response to the Claimant's assertion that “the entirety of the substation located on the {Barge

 

 

... were [sic] the ibility and obligation of the Gi » o4 the F points out

that the Claimant acknowledged its responsibility to commission all of the other systems on the

 

Substation, including the 161 KV GIS switchgear, the transformers, the relay protection devices

and the GIS control cabinets.“°

The Tribunal’s Findings on the Boundary Point Separating the Parties’ Responsibilities

459. The PPA’s definition of the “Dead Tower” is in the Tribunal’s reading clear enough. “Dead End
Tower” is defined as the last tower on the Site or such other points as may be agreed upon by
the Parties. The location of this last tower is not disputed so the question is whether there was a
different point agreed to between the parties where responsibilities of the Parties’ would be
demarcated in terms of the provision of equipment necessary for the connection to the
Transmission Lines. Although the Claimant maintains that such was the case because the RTU
was implicitly a part of the Transmission Line, the Tribunal’s reading is different. As the
Respondent notes, this equipment is on the Barge and Respondent’s responsibilities end at the
Dead End Tower outside the Barge. Jt follows that responsibility for the RTU system will
belong to the Claimant as there is no basis for extending the Respondent's responsibility further
into the Barge. The Claimant's assertion that the entirety of the Substation is the responsibility
of the Respondent is misplaced, particularly considering that, as the Respondent has also noted,
every other system on the Barge has been understood by the Claimant as falling under its own

responsibility.

460. Moreover, as the Respondent has also argued and the Tribunal has discussed above on
examination of this question on the facts, the main function of the RTU/Micro SCADA system
is to control and monitor equipment on the Power Station, a function which quite naturally will
be related to the information the system will be receiving from the operations of the
Transmission Lines but which is separate from such lines. This interpretation is further
confirmed by the fact that “Transmission Line” is defined as the 161 kV voltage transmission

line(s), transmission towers, substations and other items necessary to transmit electricity from

the “outgoing gantry of the switching facility within the Site” to the National Grid, a definition

which does not cover equipment located further to the inside of that outgoing point.

ii. Was Commissioning of the RTU / MicroSCADA a Pre-Requisite to Grid
Connectivity?

Claimant's Position

The Claimant’s position is that the Barge could not be connected to the National Grid until after
installation and commissioning of the RTU on the Barge. The Claimant advances the view
that “a fully operating properly commissioned RTU” was a pre-requisite to grid connectivity.”
The Claimant asserts that it repeatedly drew the Respondent’s attention to its responsibilities
regarding the control and relay protection systems on the Barge. The Claimant submits that
the installation of the RTU is a “clear example of ... dovetailing”, whereby the Respondent was
required to complete its physical work on the Essiama and Elubo Transmission Lines in order
for the Claimant to be able to reach FSNL.“”

The Claimant argues that the Substation “could not be integrated into” the grid system without

the RTU?

Respondent's Position

The Respondent is of the view that the RTU is not a pre-requisite to grid connectivity, asserting
that “numerous substations are connected to the grid and integrated into its communication
system without an RTU.”*' The Respondent also contends that “[the Claimant's] arguments

6 Phe function of the

regarding the RTU in these proceedings are... premature and irrelevant.’
RTU is, amongst others, to monitor and control the GIS, which in turn is the a pre-requisite to

grid connectivity. As the GIS was not operational when the lines were allegedly energised on

8 August 2008, the Respondent submits that the Claimant could not have connected to the Grid

regardless of the status of the RTU.°

The Tribunal’s Findings on the RTU as a Prerequisite to Grid Connectivity

464,

The discussion on this matter follows closely that examined above on the facts and the legal
arguments do not change the conclusions there reached. That the RTU system is necessary for
the proper functioning of the interconnection to the Nationa! Grid is true but this assumes that
the testing and commissioning of the Power Station has been finalized. Once this last stage has
been satisfied the RTU will make the interconnection possible. Before that there will be no
power generation to be integrated into the National Grid. As the Respondent has noted, if the
GIS electrical system was not operational there could have been no connection possible
irrespectively of the RTU. it follows that while the RTU is necessary for grid connectivity, it is
in turn dependant on the 161 k¥V electrical system of the Barge. If the latter is unavailable there

is no role for the RTU to perform or power to be transmitted.

iii, Which Party had the Obligation to have the RTU / MicroSCADA Installed
and Commissioned?

The Claimant's Position

465.

466.

The Claimant submits that the installation and commissioning of the RTU fell within the ambit

of the Respondent’s obligations under the PPA and the Grid Connection Process Agreement.

The Claimant further submits that Ghana adopted a National Electricity Grid Code to create a

Commission to promulgate uniform rules concerning the National Grid and that, pursuant to the

655

Code, GRIDCo was required to install and commission the RTU on the Barge.” At the Hearing

on the Merits, the Claimant placed particular emphasis on this argument, asserting that Ghana’s
Grid Code and other relevant Jegislation ~ particularly LI 1934, enacted by the board of the

Energy Commission on 4 June 2008.5" and entered into force on 23 October 2008"

the PPA because it shows that high-voltage substations form part of the NITS, and therefore fail

within the grid operator’s responsibility.
In its opening Statement at the Hearing on the Merits, the Claimant first submits that

LI 1934 clearly defined what was to be considered the NITS in Ghana. This is found in Rule
3, which simply states that the NITS is any equipment regardless of ownership, which is
designed to function or operate at any voltage higher than 36 KV. Thus [...] any reference to
equipment that operates at a high voltage, for example 161 kV, is considered by this
provision of Ghana law to constitute part of Ghana’s NITS.°?

 

 

Second, the Respondent contends that the specific obligations of the

utility as it relates to matters in these proceedings, Rule 5(3)(h) of LI 1934 required the
utility - which is GridCo, which was established in 2006 ~ to plan, develop, install and
maintain an adequate supervisory control and data acquisition system, which was
specifically defined to include both telecommunications and remote terminal units at
transmission substations and generating stations.
Third, the Respondent submits that Rule 7(c) of LI 1934 provides that GridCo was to be
“yesponsible for coordinating the design, installation and maintenance of protection systems to
ensure the timely disconnect of faulty facilities and equipment”.
Fourth, “and very relevant to these proceedings” the Claimant submits “Rule 8 [of LI 1934]
provides that for a person to become a wholesale supplier. that person was required to design,
install and maintain its plan and equipment to meet the requirements of a document called the
Connection Sub-Code, and other relevant regulations."
Fifth, the Respondent points to Rule 11 of LI 1934, which mandates the Energy Commission to
issue and prepare a Grid Code to govern the technical operation of the NITS.% According to
the Claimant, “if it is true that no Grid Code had been formally put into place as of the date of
enactment of LI 1934, there are provisions in that LI that placed an obligation on existing grid
participants -- such as the Claimant and the Respondent ~ to comply with these rules

immediately upon their coming into force.”

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 166 of 264

472. The crux of the Claimant’s argument appears to be that “[nJo time is given for any transition
from one system or form of existence to the other. Rather. persons in the position of the
Claimant were in the interim subjected to what the LI called ‘existing rules and Prudent Utility
Practice’”.* Rule 33 of LI 1934 defines Prudent Utility Practice to mean “generally accepted
design practices, methods and operation of a power system ... to meet utility and industry
codes, standards and regulations”. It follows, according to the Claimant, that “LI 1934's
reference to ‘existing rules and Prudent Utility Practice’ is a reference to the April 2007 draft,
the July 2007 version, the {23] October 2008 version,” and all other versions that came into
existence within that period.” The Claimant emphasizes that it is no coincidence that the Grid
Connection Process Agreement about the RTU was concluded between the Parties on

24 October 2008, just one day after LI 1934 came into force.“

The Respondent's Position

473. The Respondent contends that the installation and commissioning of the RTU was the
obligation of the Claimant under Clauses 2 and 3 of the PPA, citing the following excerpts in

support”?

® BEL is responsible for “equipping, completion, testing, commissioning and financing of
the Power Station."©"
* “all costs ... in connection with the equipping of the Power Station ... shall be borne by

BEL.”

474, The Respondent also draws attention to the term “Delivery Point”, defined in Clause | of the
PPA as the “dead end tower where responsibilities for equipment by [Ghana] and BE[L] are

demarcated”, and the term “Dead End Tower”, defined as the last tower on the site (Tower 1).°7

in this regard, the Respondent submits that “all equipment heading away from Tower [1] and
the Project Site towards Tema are the responsibility of the Government. All the equipment
heading away from Tower [1] and throughout the Project Site are the responsibility of Balkan.”
It follows, argues the Respondent, that “{sJince the RTU is inside the Project Site, it is the
responsibility of Balkan just like every piece of equipment on the Barge, such as the turbines,
the DCS, the MicroSCADA, the switchgear, the relay protection devices, etc."

The Respondent asserts that, as of December 2007, the Claimant acknowledged that
commissioning the RTU / MicroSCADA was its obligation, as is evidenced by the fact it sought
and obtained proposals from ABB and Taurus for this work.” In particular, the Respondent
points to an e-mail dated 2 February 2009 from Mr. Robert MacDonald, on behalf of BEL, to
Mr, Christian Moeller from ABB, after the Claimant had received ABB's proposal for installing
and commissioning the RTU / MicroSCADA.” The Respondent also points to the declarations
made by Mr. Elders at the hearing, in which he makes reference to this same proposal.°” The
Respondent asserts that “[a]s Balkan’s response to ABB makes clear, Balkan understood that
the commissioning and upgrade of the control system, including the RTU on the Barge, was its
responsibility, not the Government's, and in fact, directed ABB to redraft the proposal to meet
Balkan’s requirements and specifications.*”*

The Respondent advances the view that none of the Claimant’s assertions with respect to the
RTU / MicroSCADA “can obscure the simple fact that the RTU was equipment on the Barge
that Balkan had the responsibility to install and commission. Its failure or delay in doing so
represents a further default on its part under the PPA, and not a basis upon which it can claim an

entitlement to Tolling Fees under the PPA”.S”

The Respondent argues that the Claimant's arguments related to the Grid Code should be
disregarded, asserting that the Code was not promulgated until October 2009, and thus has no

bearing on the Parties’ respective responsibilities under the PPA and, specifically, on the issue

of responsibility for the RTU.“’ The Respondent emphasizes that the Grid Connection Process
Agreement entered into by the Parties on 24 August 2008 confirms that BEL would commission

and pay for the RTU.“! The Respondent relies on the testimony of Mr. Wiafe,*” who said that

 

he expressly rejected Mr. Elders’ assertion that refurbishment of the RTU on the Barge was the

Respondent's responsibility under the Grid Code."

 

The Tribunal’s Findings on the Obligations to Install and Commission the RTU/MicroSCADA System

 

478. Again on this matter the Parties’ legal arguments relate closely to the facts on the very same
question that has already been examined above, that is, who was responsible for installing and
commissioning the RTU/MicroSCADA system on the Barge. The Tribunal concluded then that
it was the Claimant’s responsibility to pay for the commissioning of the system, The Claimant’s
legal argument, however, submits that the installation and commissioning of the RTU fell
within the ambit of the Respondent’s obligations. In the Claimant's view this was so because
under the various preliminary versions of the Grid Code preceding its final enactment in
October 2009, as well as under law LI 1934, enacted by the board of the Energy Commission
and in force since October 2008, GRIDCo was the entity responsible for installing and
commissioning this equipment on the Barge as a part of substations operating al a voltage
higher than 36 kV, which is the case here. Other provisions of LI 1934 envisaged Gridco’s
mandate as including the responsibility to install, maintain and supervise and control data

acquisition systems.

479. Although the Claimant accepts the fact that the Grid Code was not in force at the time the PPA
was executed, it argues nevertheless that under LI 1934 there were obligations to comply with
its rules immediately upon entering into force and no time was given for a transition between
one system and the other. Existing rules and Prudent Utility Practice, also defined in that Law,
Jed directly to the application of the draft versions of the Grid Code beginning in April 2007
until its final version and entry into force. The very Grid Connection Process Agreement about
the RTU was as noted concluded between the Parties on 24 October 2008, just one day after LT

, 1934 came into force.

The Claimant's arguments are well put and would be quite convincing were it not for the fact
that they encounter two equally powerful legal arguments on the side of the Respondent. The
first is that responsibility for the equipping of the Power Station and all its costs are clearly to be
borne by the Claimant under Clauses 2 and 3 of the PPA. These clauses do not refer specifically
to the RTU but do envisage all the equipment required for the operation of the Power Station.
The second argument is that the Dead End Tower that demarcates the Parties’ responsibilities is
defined as the last tower on the site and while everything heading outwards from that Tower is
Respondent's obligation everything heading inwards to the Power Station is the responsibility
of the Claimant. It is of course well established that the RTU is located inside the Project Site.
The Tribunal must note, however, that although the respective areas of responsibility are not
always well demarcated and may depend on specific arrangements this does not detract {rom its

conclusion concerning responsibility for the RTU.

The Tribunal also discussed on the facts that the Claimant at first acknowledged its obligations
in respect of this system, as is well reflected in the correspondence between BEL and
prospective subcontractors, particularly ABB and Taurus. There was no doubt in this
correspondence as to which was the entity responsible for the installation and commissioning of
the RTU. As noted above, a similar understanding was reflected in the Grid Connection Process

Agreement of 24 August 2008 and also confirmed by Mr. Wiafe’s testimony.

The Tribunal is mindful that its task is to decide the dispute between the Parties principally as a
matter of contractual interpretation under the PPA. The terms of the PPA must accordingly
govern its reasoning and conclusions. In this light, the PPA itself and also the supplementary
agreement between the parties on the Grid Connection Process, clearly show that the installation
and commissioning of the RTU and its costs are to be borne by the Claimant. The understanding
of the Parties as expressed in the various exchanges noted also confirms this interpretation, The
Grid Code came later and it expressly envisaged that it shall not derogate from contractual
agreements. However many earlier drafts of the Grid Code there might have been none of these
earlier drafts can derogate from the terms of the contractual obligation as the Grid Code itself
provides that it does not. Accompanying legislation, which in itself is not clear enowgh, is not

dispositive of this matter. The Tribunal concludes that the Respondent prevails in this matter.

(a) Other Contractual Breaches: the Letter of Credit
i. The Claimant's Position

The Claimant also alleges the Respondent failed to comply with its obligations regarding the
Leiter of Credit and that it did not obtain the necessary approvals, permits and licenses called

for under the PPA. The Claimant does not elaborate further on its allegations in this regard.

ii. The Respondent's Position

The Respondent asserts that the Claimant’s additional claims under the “Other Breaches”
heading are “so general and non-specific as not to warrant a response”. With respect to the

Letter of Credit, it understands the Claimant’s “complaint to be that the Government refused to
certify, under the terms of the (Letter of Credit], that Balkan is entitled to Tolling Fees”.“" The
Respondent's position is that, since it does not owe the Claimant Tolling Fees, it is not in breach
of the Letter of Credit or the PPA “by reason of its refusal to provide a false certification to the
Bank”.* Alternatively, should the Tribunal consider that the Claimant is entitled to Tolling
Fees, the Respondent refers to the Claimant’s assertion that the replacement letters of credit
were not always issued 30 days prior to the expiry of the one previously issued. The Respondent
submits that such claim must fail because (a) the PPA —Clause 34.1.4.2.- provides a 60 day
grace period in case of default; (b) any claim for breach was waived by the Claimant when it
accepted the replacement Letters of Credit without objection; (c) the Claimant suffered no

damage since it never sought to draw upon a letter of credit when one was not in place.”

iii, The Tribunal’s Findings Concerning the Obligations Pertinent to the Letter
of Credit

Both the factual findings made above on this other matter and the legal arguments developed by

the Parties lead to the same conclusion, The Claimant argues that the Respondent did not

comply with its obligations in respect of the Letter of Credit without much further elaboration,
except to point out that the Respondent refused to certify in the terms of the Letter of Credit that

Claimant was entitled to Tolling Fees.

Since the Tribunal has concluded that no Tolling Fees were owed to the Claimant in view of the
fact that the Power Station never came to the stage of completing its full and final testing and
commissioning, the basis for the issuance of the Letter of Credit was no longer available and
Respondent’s argument to the effect that it could not certify an untrue fact is persuasive. The
Parties’ discussion about whether other requirements concerning the replacement of the letters

of credit within certain deadlines were met is therefore moot.

Although the Claimant has also raised the question that it incurred in financial costs in
connection with its operations and bank accounts with Zenith Bank, with particular reference to

the Letter of Credit, such costs, even if incurred, are not attributable to the Respondent.

THE CLAIMAN?’S CLAIM OF BREACH OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
i, Introduction

The Claimant contends that since the Tribunal issued its Interim Award concluding that the
Arbitration Agreement was valid and enforceable, the Respondent has nevertheless continued to
take actions in breach of the Parties’ Arbitration Agreement.” First, the Claimant argues that
the Respondent's commencement of the proceeding before a US District Court to obtain
discovery from ProEnergy was improper.”' Second, the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s
continued pursuit of its referral of the constitutionality of the PPA to the Supreme Court of

Ghana constitutes a breach of the Arbitration Agreement.”

The Respondent counters that the Claimant's claim for breach of the Arbitration Agreement on
the basis of the United States and Ghanaian litigations is “without merit”. In its Rejoinder, the

Respondent maintains this position in light of the Supreme Court Judgment of 16 May 2012.

2. The Proceeding Against ProEnergy for Discovery
(a) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the Respondent’s ex parte application before a US District Court for,
what the Claimant characterizes as “broad discovery” from ProEnergy, violates the Parties’
Arbitration Agreement.®* The Claimant submits that due to the Respondent’s actions in this
regard, it was forced to file submissions in an attempt to intervene in the United States

proceeding.

(b) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent asserts that the proceeding it initiated in the United States was pursuant to

United States Statute 28 U.S.C. § 1782, and was brought against ProEnergy, not BEL or

 

Balkan. The Respondent emphasizes that the Claimant “voluntarily chose to intervene in that

proceeding rather than rely on ProBnergy’s objection” and, as such, “had a full and fair

 

opportunity to express its view to the US District Court regarding the discovery application,
including its view that § 1782 should not apply where an arbitration is pending”.°’ The
Respondent further contends that the Claimant “cites no authority, UNCITRAL Rules, or
Arbitration Tribunal which has ever held that it is a breach of an Arbitration Agreement for a
party to seek discovery of a third party, such as ProBnergy, which is not a party to an arbitration

and not subject to the jurisdiction or discovery orders of the Arbitration Tribunal”.

(c) The Tribunal Findings in Respect of the Discovery in the ProEnergy
Proceedings

It is a fact that Respondent’s application for discovery before a US court concerned ProEnergy
as the defendant and not BEL or Balkan. That the Claimant in this case decided to intervene and
file submissions in respect of that application is quite natural as the discovery concerned

documents of relevance for this arbitration. The Tribunal is of the view that none of these steps

Statement of Claim, para. 350; Exhibit C-48: “Application for Government of Ghana Discovery”.

Statement of Defense, para. 143, Respondent states that “section 1782(a) enables foreign litigants to
petition United States courts in order to assist them in obtaining discovery of evidence in the United
States. Section 1782(a) provides, in relevant part: ‘The district court of the district in which a person
resides or is found may order him to ... produce a document or other thing for use in a proceeding in a
foreign or international tribunal ... The order may be made pursuant to ... the application of any
interested person’”.

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 173 of 264

can be considered to amount to a breach of the arbitration agreement. Had the Respondent
applied to this Tribunal for discovery of documents produced in litigation before the US courts
it is quite likely that it would not have succeeded for want of jurisdiction as ProEnergy is not a

Party to this arbitration.

493, The fact that the Claimant had the opportunity to be heard in the discovery proceedings,
including in respect of its argument that discovery could not be granted when there were
arbitration proceedings pending, is well established and thus the Claimant has not been put to
any disadvantage in the context of such discovery application, Respondent’s arguments to the
effect that there are no rules preventing discovery from a third party while the arbitration is
pending is correct. It would be of course different if the discovery proceedings were to interfere
with the conduct of the arbitration, for example because of an injunction or suspension order,

but that is not the case here.

494, Just as the Tribunal granted a prolonged schedule for submissions so as to take into account
what could be the decision of the Ghanaian courts, it can equally take inte account other
relevant documents produced in discovery to the extent that they are helpful to decide the
dispute before it. And the actual fact is that these documents were of importance in respect of

many issues before the Tribunal.

3. The Ghanaian Court Proceedings
(a) The Claimant’s Position

495. The Claimant asserts that the Respondent has also violated the Arbitration Agreement “by
continuing to prosecute litigation in the Ghanaian courts”, which, consequently, has again
required the Claimant to respond.” As set out above in the Statement of Facts, the Claimant
emphasizes that the Respondent took the following additional steps to advance its interests

before the Ghanaian courts:

* “While the trial was yet to commence in the High Court of Ghana, [Ghana] filed an
application with the Ghanaian Supreme Court to determine whether the PPA and the
Arbitration Agreement constitute international business transactions within the meaning

of the Ghanaian Constitution.”

. “In May 2011 the Ghanaian High Court denied referral of the questions to the Ghanaian

Supreme Court.”

« “In July 2011, the [Government of Ghana] filed a Motion on Notice to Invoke

Supervisory Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in the Supreme Court of Ghana

 

challenging the High Court’s ruling denying referral.”""”

(b) The Respondent’s Position

496. The Respondent counters the Claimant's assertion that the proceedings before the Ghanaian
courts violate the Arbitration Agreement. First, the Respondent argues that had “the Tribunal
viewed those proceedings as a breach of the arbitration agreement, il presumably would have
granted, rather than denied, Balkan’s request for an injunction of those proceedings”.”’ Second,
the Respondent argues that the schedule for this arbitration set by the Tribunal expressly
allowed for a reference of the constitutional issue to the Supreme Court.” In its Interim Award,
the Tribunal noted its willingness to adjust the schedule of this arbitration “to consider and take
fully into account the views of the Ghanaian courts on the issues raised with regard to the

applicability of Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution”. Third, the Respondent submits

 

that the Ghanaian proceedings “involve additional parties who are not parties to the Arbitration
Agreement and are, as such, not subject to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal”. Finally, the
Respondent asserts that it has not misrepresented this Tribunal’s Interim Award before the
United States or Ghanaian courts, “as Balkan did to the U.S. Court, in the discovery proceedings
against ProEnergy”.””
497. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent further submits that, while the Supreme Court Judgment states
that “the Arbitration Agreement was not an international business transaction within the
meaning of Article 181(5) of the Constitution”,” there was no finding that the proceedings in

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Documer

 

Ghana themselves violated the Arbitration Agreement; “nor could it” because those proceedings

involve parties not privy to the Arbitration Agreement to the PPA.”

{c) The Tribunal’s Findings on the Breach of the Arbitration Agreement by
Virtue of the Ghanaian Court Proceedings

The Tribunal does not consider that proceedings before the Ghanaian courts could be held to be
in breach of the arbitration agreement, as argued by the Claimant. Had such proceedings or any
decision adopted thereunder interfered with the progress of this arbitration or with the authority
of this Tribunal to properly conduct its business the conclusion might have been different. But
that was not the case and in fact, as the Respondent notes, in its Interim Award the Tribunal
denied the Claimant’s request for an injunction of such proceedings because no such
interference arose from the Ghanaian courts. In its Interim Submission of 20 June 2012 the
Claimant has requested the Tribunal to reconsider its decision on anti-suit injunction, a request

which the Tribunal denied.

It is also to be kept in mind that, as also noted by the Respondent, the schedule of this
arbitration was longer than usual so as to allow prudent time for the Supreme Court to make its
views on the constitutional issues of the case known. It should also be noted that if such views
had not become available at a time compatible with the schedule of the arbitration it is quite
likely that the Tribunal would have continued to move forward in the discharge of its duties, but
this was not the case, As there has been no interference with this arbitration by the proceedings
before the Supreme Court, nor any interference of this arbitration with the Ghanaian court
proceedings, the arbitration agreement has been duly complied with. Accordingly there is no
basis either for the Claimant’s request in the alternative made in the same Interim Submission

that the Tribunal should give no weight to the Supreme Court judgment.

THE CLAIMANT’S ALTERNATIVE CLAIMS

In the alternative to its breach of contract claims, the Claimant raises the following additional

Ghanaian Constitution, and therefore understands that the introduction of the word “not” at para. 155 of
its Rejoinder is nothing but a mistake. This is confirmed, for instance, at paras 17 and 24 of the Rejoinder.

2. Unjust Enrichment

 

(a) The Test

 

502. The Claimant submits that both Ghanaian and Dutch law subscribe to the principle of unjust
. enrichment. The Claimant goes on to cite Article 212 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (the

“DCCP”), which provides as follows:

 

I, A person who has been unjustifiably enriched at the expense of another is obliged,
insofar as reasonable, to make good the other's loss up to the amount of his
enrichment,

2, The enrichment shall not be taken into consideration to the extent that it is decreased

by reason of circumstances for which the person enriched is accountable.

3. An enrichment shall be discounted to the extent that it is decreased during a period
in which the person enriched could not reasonably be expected to recognize the
existence of an obligation to make good the other's loss. In determining such
decrease account must be taken of any expenditure which would not have been.
incurred but for the enrichment.”

     

503. The Respondent endorses the definition of unjust enrichment set out by the Claimant.”"*

(b) The Claimant’s Position

504. If the PPA indeed required Parliamentary approval, and, as a consequence, is null and void, then
the Claimant asserts that the Respondent has been unjustly enriched by all the money, in excess
of USD 40 million, expended by the Claimant in connection with the Barge.” In this regard,
the Claimant maintains that it “is entitled to restitution of ail the money it has expended under

the PPA under the foregoing principle of failure of consideration”.”*

In further support of its unjust enrichment claim, the Claimant submits that Ghanaian law

recognizes the following common law notions of equity, as paraphrased by the Claimant:

. “{W]here money has been paid under a transaction that is or becomes ineffective, the
payer may recover the value of the money paid provided that the consideration for the
payment has totally failed.”

* “If a contract is void ab initio for informality or incapacity, or if the contract is discharged
automatically, as in the case of frustration, any payment or credit received made under the

apparent contract is recoverable.””""

(ec) The Respondent’s Position

In its Statement of Defense, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant’s claim for unjust
enrichment should be denied for the following four reasons,’ First, the Respondent submits
that it has not received a benefit. In this regard, the Respondent emphasizes that to-date, “the
Power Station remains unfinished and incapable of generating any power whatsoever for

Ghana.

72

Second, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's calculation of damages is improperly based
“upon the wholesale submission of invoices it claims to have paid to ProEnergy and others”,
which “fails to take into account any of its own allegations [in the ProEnergy Litigation}
regarding improper invoicing, double billing, or corrective work”.”°

Third, the Respondent asserts that the documents related to the Claimant’s settlement with
ProEnergy in their US litigation “may well, in and of itself, demonstrate offsets to the amount

Balkans [sic] seeks here”.”*

7 t 509. Fourth, the Respondent contends that the invoices submitted by the Claimant as attachments to
Be

the Witness Statement of Neil Crouch”* do not evidence any costs related to the commissioning

' of the Barge. Rather, the Respondent asserts that these invoices include the following:

« “payment made to an Elias Assouad in Lebanon in January 2011 which appear to be for a

 

f contract between Mr. Assouad’s company and Balkan ... U.S. for a success fee in this
toe arbitration”;°°
: » “an unexplained wire transfer from Synteck West, Inc. to Control Risks in January 2010
(after Balkan, but its own admission, ceased all work on the Barge) and which contains no.
description of services”;””7
= “payments to Curly Baca & Associates in June 2007 for hotel, meals and car rental in
connection with their consulting advice to EPC International, Inc. in drafting BEL’s PPA
(i.e., an expense relating to the attempt to obtain the assignment [of the PPA from Balkan
US to BEL)":”*

= “a payment to Tower Executive Suites in Sugar Land, Texas for Phillip Elders, as well as a

payment for his laptop”;”” and

= “fojther exhibits simply consist of flights, hotels, and expenses with no specific information

attributable to the commission process."

510. The Respondent does not address the Claimant’s unjust enrichment claim further in its

Rejoinder.

511. In its opening statement at the Hearing on the Merits, the Respondent made its position clear:
“Tf you’ ve done work, you are entitled to be paid for that work; not under the contract damages,

but you are entitled to be paid.” However, the Respondent also submits that the

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 179 of 264

difficulty with Balkan's claim for unjust enrichment is that it utterly fails for want of proof. To
prevail on a claim for unjust enrichment, Balkan was required, as part of its case in-chief, to
present evidence as to the value of the benefit conferred. What did Balkan do? Balkan
presented invoices and spreadsheets showing the money that it spent. [...] money spent does
not necessarily equal benefit conferred.”

 

512. Specifically with respect to the invoices submitted by the Claimant in this arbitration, the

Respondent asserts that,

under a best case scenario, approximately [USD] 20 million ~ not [USD] 56 million, not (USD}
60 million, not [USD] 140 million ~ approximately [USD] 20 million appears to be for invoices
for work on the barge. A lot of invoices for {Tunes and things like that. But when we talk about
work on the barge, it’s less than [USD] 20 million; and many of those [USD] 20 million consist
of inflated and unjustified invoices that provided no benefit to the barge.”

 

“an extraordinary omission” of

 

513. The Respondent further remarked upon what it characterizes
evidence as to the condition of the Barge today; particularly in light of the fact that the Claimant

still retains control over the Barge today.
Merits was that, having exercised control over the Barge from the time of the signing of the
PPA until today, the Claimant was “then charged with the obligation to maintain the systems
that they say that they worked on; and there is no evidence ~ none — that Balkan has maintained
those systems for the past four years since 2009 and since the commencement of this
arbitration.””* The Respondent emphasizes that “[w]e have no evidence as to the condition, and
we have no evidence whatsoever ~ not one exhibit ~ that tells us about maintenance.”””
514. In support of its assertion regarding the lack of evidence, and its consequences on the
determination of quantum, the Respondent draws the Tribunal’s attention to Mr. Elder’s 2007
PPA tariff analysis, attached to his witness statement in this arbitration, which explained to the
Ministry of Energy why BEL should be paid what he indicates it should be paid, stating, in
relevant part: “(t]he initial reports reveal that minimal to no maintenance and preservation
efforts have been committed to the barge for an extended period of time. There are no

maintenance and preservation records available.””"" Further, “(t]he constant exposure of critical

equipment to salt water moisture without operation has resulted in major operation risk.””* The

Respondent goes on to quote several passages from the 2007 tariff analysis that speak to the

decrepit state of the Barge in 2007, 739 asserting that the Tribunal is now placed in a position “to

decide an unjust enrichment claim based upon an incomplete presentation of equipment in a

saltwater environment, with not only Ansaldo but Balkan itself telling you exactly what that

environment can do, and with Baikan telling you why you need records that show that the

equipment has been maintained pursuant to the manufacturer’ s specifications” 70

515. The Respondent submits that on several occasions it sought to conduct site inspections at the
Barge during 2008 and 2009, but “were either put off or they were denied or they were given
limited access or they were unable to verify”. The Respondent's following line of argument
appears to request that the Tribunal draw an adverse inference from the Claimant’s inability to
furnish test results on the critical systems on the Barge — “the only reason that you don’t provide
tests and that you don’t allow site visits and that you don’t agree to an independent person
coming in to look is because you don’t have the tests, you can’t support the claim, you have
something to hide”."*

516. The Respondent also points to ProEnergy’s daily reports (¢-g. partially excerpted above in the
Facts section), arguing that “those documents actually show how this commissioning effort
went wildly astray from the start”

517. Finally, in its Post-Hearing Submission, the Respondent makes reference to a recent decision of
the Supreme Court of Ghana,’ which provides that a contract that has been declared void ab
initio for breach of a constitutional provision cannot create any rights, therefore precluding the

grant of any restitutionary remedy.”

(d) The Tribunal’s Findings on Unjust Enrichment

The fact that both Parties agree on the definition of unjust enrichment is helpful to the Tribunal
as this is a concept that has Jent itself to many interpretations some of which are imprecise. The
essence. of the concept is thus that a benefit has been conferred on the other party without

compensation and where such compensation would be reasonably expected.

The Claimant's justification for its alternative claim on unjust enrichment is based on the
premise that if the PPA is declared null and void then the Respondent would have been as a
consequence unjustly enriched in the amount of money expended on the Barge. Restitution of
such money would then be the appropriate remedy under the principle of failure of
consideration. The fact of the matter, however, is (hat the Tribunal has found above that the
PPA is “valid” and creates obligations for the Parties. Moreover, in the Respondent's view, no
such benefit could have been received as the Power Station remains unfinished and incapable of
generating energy. As the Tribunal has found above on the issue of testing and commissioning
of the Power Station there is indeed no production capacity at present and accordingly no power
is being delivered to Ghana. Were this a consequence of the Respondent's failure to comply
with its obligations under the PPA, particularly in terms of grid connectivity, a benefit would
have been readily identifiable, but the ultimate reason for this failure lies not fully with the

Respondent.

The Parties are in any event in disagreement about the calculation and amount of damages.
While the Claimant estimates such damages in excess of US$ 40 million, the Respondent
believes that the expenses were at most one half of that amount as many invoices submitted
were questioned in the ProEnergy Litigation by Claimant itself, while other invoices are not
related to the commissioning of the Barge. The Respondent has rightly noted in this respect that
the evidence must be specifically related to the benefit conferred and not simply to the addition
of expenses. The Parties have also disputed whether there was any proper maintenance of the
systems on the Barge, which as the Tribunal has also found above was in the best of cases
minimal and could hardly be considered as conferring a benefit to the Respondent. Requests for
site inspections were not successful in many cases and thus the possibility of ascertaining the

state of maintenance and repair has also remained in doubt,

While the Tribunal considers that this alternative claim suffers from a partial lack of proof of
benefit conferred, this does not mean that damages are to be ruled out in the light of the fact that
the Respondent also has responsibility for not having complied fully and timely with its

obligations under the PPA concerning site electricity, grid connectivity and other matters. In

t nae .
Hy ‘ such case, however, damages are the consequence of liability for contract breach. The question
i ' of damages in this other context will be considered below but the Tribunal must note that
i Respondent's invocation of a recent decision of the Supreme Court of Ghana, establishing that a

&
i

contract declared void ab initio for breach of a constitutional provision cannot create any rights,
and therefore precludes the grant of any restitutionary remedy, is not to be sustained, partly
because no such nullity was found by the Tribunal and partiy because rights can even be created

in such circumstances if the Government bears responsibility for such breach, as is the case

 

here.

3. Fraud or Deceit

(a) The Test

wn
nN
os

The Claimant submits that the tort of deceit provides a civil remedy for a party who has relied
ona false representation where the following elements of the tort are made out:
i, A party has made a representation to another party which is false;

2. The first party making the representation knew that it was false or was reckless as to the
truth of the statement;

3. There was an intention to deceive;
4. The representation was acted upon; and
5. Loss is suffered as a consequence.”
523. The Claimant submits that this common law test for deceit is reflected in Article 162 of the

DCCP, as well as in Ghanaian law by virtue of Article 11(1) of the Constitution.”

524. The Respondent does not contest the Claimant’s characterization of the test for deceit.

(b) The Claimant’s Position

525. The Claimant contends that it was “induced” to enter into the PPA based on its reliance on the
representations provided by the then Attorney General, Mr. Ghartey, in two legal opinions dated

26 October 2007, in which he stated that Ghana had the power to enter into the PPA and Lease

“represented and implied that BE[L] ... had a valid agreement going so far as to fix and demand

19789

BE[L] ...’s performance thereunder.

526. The Claimant thereby contends that it is entitled to damages in the amount it would have
received under the PPA or, alternatively, the amount it has actually spent on the Barge

project.”

527. In its Reply, the Claimant asserts that the PPA “gave rise to an implied warranty or express

obligation on the part of the Respondent”, including the warranty that, under Clause 7.2(i) of the

 

PPA, it “supply to BE{L] ‘issuance of a letter from the Government of Ghana that al} required
approvals from the relevant authorities in Ghana had been obtained””.” Further, under Clause

2.6 of the PPA, the Claimant submits that the Respondent “obligated itself to promptly facilitate

 

the acquisition of all government approvals for the project."

 

528. The Claimant asserts that, despite these implied condition precedents at the charge of the

 

Respondent, it understands the Respondent's position to be that “its Attorney General made a
legal mistake of a matter of first impression ... and accordingly, no liability can attach.” The
Claimant further alleges that the Respondent has failed to present any other evidence that it
indeed undertook steps to obtain the necessary Constitutional approval.’ In its Post-Hearing
Submission, the Claimant makes reference to the testimony of Ms. Gadzekpo, who according to
the Claimant impliedly confirmed that the Respondent made a deliberate decision not to seek

parliamentary approval of the BEL PPA.”

529, The Claimant argues that to the extent that the Respondent contends that the Attorney General's

opinion letters were not a warranty, the content of those letter constitute a statement of fact.”°

The Claimant further submits that “U.K. law has long-recognized that matters of opinion that

. nT5
are reduced to warranties under a contract are actionable.””*°

{c) The Respondent’s Position

 

530. The Respondent is of the view that the Claimant’s claims for fraud and deceit fail for the

 

following two reasons.””’ First, the Respondent argues that the former Ghanaian Attorney

 

' General’s opinion regarding the interpretation of Article 181(5) of the Constitution is not
: actionable as a matter of law.’™ The Respondent also draws attention to Clause 31 of the PPA,
in which the Parties acknowledge that in executing the PPA, each party “has relied solely on its
judgment, belief, and knowledge, and such advice as it may have received from its own counsel
and it has not been influenced by any representation or statements made by any other party or

such party’s counsel”.”*°

531.

in further support for its assertion that the Claimant’s alleged reliance on the opinion of the
former Attorney General is of no consequence in this arbitration, the Respondent relies on the

7 Tuffuor v. Attorney-

following authorities: Airmotive Engineering Corp. v. United States,
General. Attorney-General y. Faroe Atlantic Co. Lid,,"* United States v. Marine Shale

Processors,”® and Rhyl Urban DC v. Rhyl Amusement Ltd."*

532. Second, and in the alternative, the Respondent submits that “even if the Claimant were entitled
to rely upon the opinion of the Attorney General, an action for deceit will not lie absent a

showing that the Attorney General issued his opinion knowing it to be false at the time it was

made”, which it submits the Claimant has not shown.” (The Respondent further emphasizes

that the former Attorney General’s opinion was in line with the opinion of the Claimant's

current Ghanaian counsel.)’*

533. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent contends that the Claimant's “recast[ing]” of its fraud or deceit

claim as one under the PPA for “implied warranty or express obligation” ”” fails for four

 

 

reasons.’ First, the Respondent reiterates its assertion that Claimant’s claims fail because the

PPA is void ab initio as a result of the Supreme Court Judgment.”

534. Second, the Respondent argues that Clause 20 is the only provision of the PPA that refers to a
“warranty” of any kind between the parties and in that clause it is only the Claimant that

warrants to do certain things.”

 

535. Third, the Respondent draws attention to Clause 31 of the PPA, regarding “Joint Effort and
Confidentiality”, which it argues “makes clear that Balkan was not entitled to rely upon the
opinion of the Attorney General,” as each party acknowledges that it has relied solely on its own

judgment in entering into the PPA.”

536. Fourth, and finally, the Respondent reiterates its assertion that the Attorney General’s opinion is

“not actionable as a matier of law”.”*

(a) The Tribunal’s Findings Concerning the Claim for Fraud or Deceit

537. Again in this matter the Parties have agreed on the definition of fraud or deceit. The Tribunal
has no reason to depart from the test stated and the essential characteristics that fraud or deceit
involves a deliberate misrepresentation of the truth or the facts so as to induce another party to
act to its detriment. Because the Tribunal has held the PPA does impose obligations on the
parties thereto, a claim in the alternative to a finding of liability as a consequence of its breach

does not have legal support.

Even if this were not the case, it would hardly be conceivable that the two opinions of the
Attorney General issued at the time of the negotiation of the PPA were done with the deliberate
intention of misrepresenting the law or the facts to the Claimant. There is indeed no evidence of
this and none has been argued by the Claimant. The two opinions were indeed relevant to the
Claimant's decision to finalize the negotiation of the PPA and so was the continuing conduct of
the Respondent to consider the PPA as a valid agreement. Accordingly, the Respondent's
understanding that it had obtained all required approvals from the relevant authorities as
provided for under Clause 7. 2 (i) of the PPA, and the commitment under Clause 2.6 that the
Government would promptly facilitate the acquisition of all government approvals for the
project, are devoid of any intention to commit fraud or deceit. At the most, as the Respondent
maintains, it could be considered a legal mistake but not an intentional misrepresentation of the

law or the facts.

The Respondent has also called attention to Clause 31 of the PPA in which each party
acknowledges to have relied solely on the advice of its own counsel and has not been influenced
by the opinions or statements of the other party or its counse}. The Tribunal does not understand
this Clause to mean that the Parties could not have relied on the opinions of public officials or
entities entrusted with the role of determining legal matters involved in their transactions.
Neither do the allegations concerning implied warranties or express obligations alter the validity
of the Government’s legal officers’ opinions. The Respondent maintains that the Attorney
General’s opinion on interpretation of the Constitution is not actionable as a matter of law, and
that in any event the PPA is void as a result of the Supreme Court judgment. However, the
Tribunal does not consider that this is the case, especially where the rights of investors are

affected by such an opinion.

4. False Arrest
(a) The Test

The Claimant submits that “[flalse arrest or false imprisonment is the act of arresting or
imprisoning any person without lawful justification, or otherwise preventing him from

exercising his right of leaving the place where he is.””” A defendant may be held liable in

Statement of Claim, para. 379; Salmond, at 123.

Ghana for this charge if it authorized or directed a particular arrest.” The Respondent does not

contest the Claimant’s characterization in this regard.

(b) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant asserts that, shortly after it initiated this arbitration, the Respondent “had Tim
Everhart, the General Manager of BE[L] ... arrested, stripped to his underwear, placed in jail,
not allowed to contact an attorney, and initially not allowed to contact the American
Embassy”,”* Mr. Everhart was arrested on the suspicion that he was stealing the DCS from the
Power Station.” The Claimant contends that Mr. Everhart was merely directing the movement
of BEL’s own DCS from the Barge to a locked air-conditioned administrative office elsewhere.
on the Project Site.’”” The Claimant further asserts that the “timing of the arrest ... on such
frivolous grounds readily shows that it was in retaliation for BE[L] ... filing ... the arbitration
proceedings”.”"* The Claimant argues that the arrest had a “chilling effect” on other BEL

emp loyees.””

The Claimant’s Reply does not address the points raised by the Respondent in its Statement of

Defense, described below.

In its Post-Hearing Submission, the Claimant cites the Mogotey v. Asare case," which details
the factors to be taken into account in awarding general damages for false imprisonment.
According to the Claimant, “substantial damages might be awarded for the injury to the
plaintiff’s dignity, discomfort or inconvenience even where there has been neither physical
injury nor loss of pecuniary damages. The time, place and manner of the trespass and the

conduct of the defendant might be taken into account.”

(ec) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s claim for false arrest should be dismissed on the
following three grounds. First, the Claimant has no standing to assert such a claim on behalf of

Mr. Everhart, and does not refer to any legal authority to support its right to do so.”*

Second, the Respondent contends that even if Mr. Everhart chose to pursue a personal claim, he
is not a party to the Arbitration Agreement at issue in this arbitration, thus the Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction in this regard.”*

Third, Ghana’s Bureau of National Investigation (the “BNI”) had just cause “to believe that key
equipment necessary for the operation of the Power Station was being removed from the
premises” and, accordingly, “the officer acted under proper authority to make the arrest based

upon his reasonable suspicion that property was being removed, or about to be removed”.

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent notes that the Claimant’s Reply does not address any of the
points the Respondent raised in its Statement of Defense, except to provide further statements

785

from Messrs. Berkenbile and Everhart regarding the latter's arrest.” The Respondent also relies

on the Witness Statements of Messrs. Moro Adama and Reuben Yao Dugah, which purportedly
shed further light on the events related to Mr. Everhart’s arrest.”

In its Post-Hearing Submission, the Respondent notes that at the hearing the Claimant did not
address the Respondent's argument that the Claimant lacks standing to assert a claim of false

arrest on behalf of Mr. Everhart, nor did it introduce any evidence.”*”

(d) The Tribunal’s Findings on False Arrest

Tn respect of this claim the Parties have also not disagreed on the definition of what constitutes
false arrest but have strongly disagreed about the facts of the Claimant’s allegations. It is an
established fact, however, that officers of the Bureau of National Investigation arrested Mr. Tim

Everhart, BEL’s General Manager, shortly after the initiation of this arbitration. Mr. William

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 189 of 264

Berkenbile was also detained on this occasion. Although the treatment Mr. Everhart received on
being arrested has been to an extent disputed, it is also a fact that he was placed in jail, and was
unable to contact an attorney and was without access to the United States consular official or

some other official that could have intervened at that point.

The Respondent's explanation for this arrest was the BNI’s suspicion that Mr. Everhart was
removing or about to remove the DCS equipment from the Power Station, and that in any event
the officer in charge acted under proper authority. The Claimant has disputed this assertion
maintaining that Mr, Everhart was merely directing the movement of BEL’s own DCS to a
different Jocation on the Project Site. The evidence on the circumstances of the arrest is not
quite clear. While the witness statements of Messrs. Moro Adama and Reuben Yao Dugah

reiterate the fi

 

as explained by the Respondent, the Tribunal is not convinced that on moving

the equipment there was any intention to illegitimately appropriate the equipment.

Jn addition, the Tribunal is uncomfortable with the fact that this arrest took place at a time that
gives credibility to the Claimant’s assertion that it was in retaliation for the Claimant filing the
arbitration. Even though there is no specific evidence to link these two facts the mere
circumstance that they coincided in their timing does not allow the Tribunal to reject the
Claimant's allegations. It should also be noted that the assertion by the Respondent’s witness.
that the officers involved had been instructed by their superiors in Accra and were therefore
acting under proper authority” necessarily rules out that this was the result of a mistake of an

uninformed local officer.

Irrespective of this coincidence in time, it is equally regrettable that the arrests took place at all
and in conditions that do not appear to have duly taken into account the rights of the accused or
their dignity. The Claimant's reliance on the Mogotey v. Asare case as authority for the award of
general damages for false imprisonment and the injury sustained by the affected persons in
terms of his dignity, discomfort or inconvenience, even in the absence of physical injury or
pecuniary loss, appears to the Tribunal to be a powerful statement of the law and is also

reasonable.

The Tribunal will accordingly take these considerations into account on determining the issue of
damages. In the view of the Tribunal, when the normal conduct of business is affected by such
an arrest the question is no longer one that involves a personal claim by the person concerned. ft

is the business as a whole that suffers the consequences. The Respondent’s assertion that

_ Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 190 of 264

Mr. Everhart has no standing in this arbitration because he is not a party to the arbitration
agreement will accordingly not be sustained by the Tribunal because what is at issue here is not
only the personal inconvenience of the person arrested but also the interference with the
ordinary conduct of the business of the Claimant. The Tribunal cannot disregard either of these

considerations.

5. Conversion and Trespass

 

{a) The Test

554. The key elements of the tort of conversion are as follows:

 

1. Possession of good to which the defendant is not the owner; and

789)

2. An intent to deny the owner’s right or assert an inconsistent right.

 

‘The Claimant submits that “even a temporary taking can constitute a conversion."

555. The Claimant further submits that trespass “is defined as the immediate and authorized direct

 

interference with another’s goods”, To prove trespass, a deliberate interference with another's

goods must be established.”

556. The Respondent does not object to the definitions and corresponding tests for conversion and

trespass, respectively, set out by the Claimant.”*

(b) The Claimant’s Position

557. The Claimant contends that the Respondent seized the DCS from the Project Site and detained it
for approximately five months.” Without the DCS, the Claimant alleges that it could not
control and operate the Power Station.” The Claimant further alleges that the seizure
compromised the integrity of the DCS, such that it could not be used after its return because the

Claimant “had no way to ensure the integrity and safety of the programming on the DCS after it

had been out of its possession”.”* As a result, the Claimant argues that the Respondent’s seizing
of the DCS constitutes both a conversion and a trespass of the Claimant’s rights in the DCS,

which it asserts will cost USD 2.586 million to replace.”

558. The Claimant’s Reply does not address the Respondent's arguments, described below. The
Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission largely reproduces the arguments submitted in the
Statement of Claim and adds a reference to the Standard Chartered Bank case, which provides a

criterion to quantify the damages for trespass to goods.”

(c) The Respondent’s Position

559. The Respondent asserts that the Claimant’s claims for conversion and trespass fail as a matter of
jaw under the applicable legislation in Ghana. In support, the Respondent refers to Section 94 of
Ghana’s Criminal Procedure Code, 1960 (Act 30), which empowers a police officer to seize,
without a warrant, any property which he or she has reasonable cause to believe has been
stolen.”* The Respondent also refers to Section 40 of the Security and Intelligence Agencies
Act, 1996 (Act 526), which it says “gives officers of the BNI the same powers as those

conferred on the police”.

560. The Respondent further asserts that the Claimant’s admitted attempt to remove the DCS from
the Barge indeed “supports what BNI was told, [namely] that essential systems were being

removed from the Power Station”.””

S61.

The Respondent also notes that, as of late December 2009, the Claimant ceased ail its efforts on

 

the Barge.” As a result, the Respondent submits that it had reasonable cause to believe that
BEL “took the DCS ... from the Control Sysiem with the idea of removing it from the Project

Site altogether, thus making it impossible for the Government to operate the Barge should

 

Balkan lose the arbitration or abandon the site”.*”"

With respect to the Claimant’s assertion that the DCS was of questionable integrity upon its
return, the Respondent points out that the Claimant “could have tested the system as it requested

both ABB and Taurus to do in 2008”.“”

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent notes that the Claimant does not address this claim in its Reply,
“presumably recognizing that the claim fails as a matter of law”. The Respondent makes a
similar observation in its Post-Hearing Submission, arguing that the Claimant did not introduce

any new evidence or presented any new argument at the hearing.”

(d) The Tribunal’s Findings Concerning Conversion and Trespass

The final alternative claim concerns Claimant’s allegation of conversion and trespass on the part
of the Respondent. Again here there is no disagreement between the Parties as to the meaning of
these concepts. It is an established fact that the Respondent seized the DCS equipment at the at
the time of the arrests discussed above. Whether this happened at the Project Site as argued by
the Claimant or elsewhere is immaterial as it is also a fact that the Respondent kept this
equipment for a period far too long to that needed to investigate who was the owner. It must be
recalled that the reason offered by the Respondent for the arrests was that Mr. Everhart was
removing property that did not belong to him or to BEL. The Claimant maintains that the DCS
was kept by the Respondent for approximately five months. The precise period during which the
Respondent retained the DCS is not clear but what is clear is that the equipment was tampered
with to an extent that has no connection to the determination of the ownership of the equipment.
This was most likely not done by the local police or investigative officers but by some

institution higher up in the chain of command.

The Claimant’s argument to the effect that it could not control and operate the Power Station
without the equipment is formally true but as the Tribunal has found that the Power Station was
nowhere close to completion the equipment could hardly have been a factor for the operation of
the Power Station at the time. What is nonetheless convincing is the Claimant’s assertion that
manipulation of the equipment compromised its integrity and safety as its programming

functions could no longer be relied upon. It is ue that the Claimant could have tested the

806,

equipment as the Respondent argues but the fact of the matter is that confidence in its proper
functioning could not be reestablished after such manipulation. The Claimant puts the
replacement cost at USD 2.586 million. The Tribunal will discuss this damage further below

with particular reference to the time period in which damages might be compensable.

The Respondent has argued in its defense that under the Ghanaian Code of Criminal Procedure
a police officer is empowered to seize property without a warrant when it believes that it has
been stolen or dishonestly received. Even if this had been the case, there still would be no
justification for keeping the equipment for such a prolonged period of time. In the view of the
Tribunal, the suggestion that BEL was attempting to remove the equipment to make it
impossible for the Government to operate the Barge in case the arbitration was lost or Claimant
abandoned the site is not credible. It appears to be a farfetched proposition without any

supporting evidence.

THE RESPONDENT’S COUNTERCLAIM.

The Respondent originally advanced two counterclaims in this arbitration: first, that the

Claimant has breached the PPA; and second, that the Claimant made several material

 

to it ing its i and capability of ing liquid/gas fired

 

P
power plants and that it could commission the Power Station within ninety (90) working days of
the Effective Date of the PPA.“ As noted above, the second counterclaim was withdrawn.
Accordingly, the Tribunal will in the following only address the first counterclaim, which it is

called to decide upon.

1 The Respondent’s Position

If the Tribunal determines that the PPA is enforceable, notwithstanding the Supreme Court
Judgment that it is void ab initio, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal declare the
Claimant in default, terminate the PPA, and award the Respondent damages in the amount of

USD 300,000 for breach of contract, pursuant to Clause 14.2 of the PPA.“

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 194 of 264

569. The Respondent reiterates that the Claimant was required to complete the commissioning of the

Power Station by March 2008." The Respondent asserts that at no time did the Government

 

declare a default or implicitly extend this March date under Clause 7.3 of the PPA in response

t

to the Claimant's claims regarding site electricity. The Respondent emphasizes that the
Claimant represented that it could complete the commissioning process within thirty days of
connecting to the National Grid;*” however, this did not occur, even after the Respondent says
it energised the Essiama and Elubo Transmission Lines, on 8 August 2008 and 13 November

*!© Based on the foregoing, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant “could,

2008, respectively.
and should, have completed its commissioning work and been ready for Final Performance
Testing within thirty (30) days of either of those lines being energized”.""' The Respondent
purports that the Claimant, “by its own admission”, “was stil] months away from even being

able to fire the turbines” and, moreover, did nothing to make the Barge operational in 2009."*

2. ‘The Claimant’s Position

570. The Claimant does not respond to the Respondent’s counterclaim, save to assert that “the
Respondent sets forth no precedent or legal authority to enunciate for the Tribunal the elements
of proof for the referenced claims, nor an enumeration of the evidence it has adduced that could

be claims to establish that element under the use at trial rule."*"?

3. The Tribunal’s Findings on Respondent’s Counterclaim

 

571. The Respondent’s remaining counterclaim concerns the alleged breach of the PPA by the
Claimant. This counterclaim is also made in the alternative, as it can only stand in case the
Tribunal finds the PPA to be enforceable, contrary to Respondent's main argument that the PPA
is void ab initio. This is indeed what the Tribunal has found in this case.

default, terminate the PPA and award damages in the amount of USD 300,000 for breach of
contract as provided for under Clause 14.2 of the PPA. The Claimant has not argued in response

to this counterclaim although it points to the lack of evidence in support thereof.

573. Technically the Claimant is in default as it did not complete the final testing and commissioning
of the Power Station by March 2008 or at any relevant time thereafter, nor was the date
extended. But the situation was more complex than that. First there were objective problems
concerning the availability of site electricity and the connectivity to the National Grid. While
many such problems were gradually redressed and as discussed above were not the
determinative cause for the non completion of the Power Station, still they represent a partial
breach of the Respondent's obligations under the PPA. It would thes be inappropriate for the
Tribunal to declare the default of one party in circumstances that both did not adequately or

fully complied with the terms and obligations of the PPA.

4. Liability and Termination of the PPA

574. From the discussion of the facts and the legal arguments set out above the Tribunal can only
conclude that both Parties are liable for breach of the PPA. The Claimant is liable for not having
completed the testing and commissioning of the Power Station for reasons that are independent
of the Respondent’s breach of its own obligations. The latter breaches relate not only to the
absence of site electricity and connectivity to the National Grid but also to the questions of false

arrest, conversions and trespass and other issues that have been discussed, Although in the end

 

the breaches by both Parties made the process of commissioning more difficult the respective
liabilities are of a different kind, intensity and extent. These considerations will be next taken up

by the Tribunal in determining damages.

575. When all the elements involved in this dispute are considered in the aggregate it becomes
evident for the Tribunal that the PPA no longer serves a purpose and is incapable of governing
the relations between the Parties so as to ensure its objectives. A decision of the Tribunal
requiring enforcement of the PPA and strict compliance with its terms would, far from settling
the dispute, give rise to continuing confrontation between the Parties. In this light the Tribunal’s
determination that the PPA is valid is accompanied by the final determination that in the

circumstances it is nonetheless not enforceable.

576. The Tribunal accordingly finds that the termination of the PPA is the only reasonable alternative

in the light of the extraordinary circumstances of this dispute and the bitter confrontation

us

between the Parties, taking into account in particular that the PPA is a long term contract the
implementation of which would require the active cooperation of the Parties. The essential

purpose of the Project embodied in the PPA is thus unattainable.

The Tribunal notes that both Parties are in agreement about this consequence of the breach of
the PPA, albeit for different reasons. Indeed, in its letter of 23 April 2013, relating to the
submission on damages, the Claimant considers the PPA terminated as of | January 2014, the
estimated date of the Tribunal’s Award. due to non-performance by the Respondent going
forward. The Respondent also requests the termination of the PPA in the context of its

counterclaim.

The Tribunal has found the PPA valid, but in view of the Parties profound disagreement, it
concludes that the PPA has become impossible to be enforced. The Tribunal therefore decides
that the PPA be terminated as at the date of this Award, without prejudice to the questions of

damages as discussed below.

DAMAGES AND OTHER RELIEF SOUGHT BY THE PARTIES

Cumulatively or in the alternative, the Claimant seeks damages for Tolling Fees, repudiation
damages, restitution, and incidental direct damages.*" As set out above, the Respondent argues
that the Claimant has failed to establish it is entitled to damages under any of the
aforementioned heads of damages. The Tribunal will now assess the damages due as a
consequence of its finding that both Parties have liability for breach of the PPA, albeit to a
different extent. The Tribunal has found the PPA valid but, in view of the Parties profound
disagreements, concludes that it has become unenforceable. It thus finds the PPA to be

terminated.

TOLLING FEES
J. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant seeks damages for the Respondent’s failure to pay Tolling Fees to it pursuant to
Clause 11.9 of the PPA. The Claimant submits that Tolling Fees are ongoing. It provided a
preliminary accounting of USD 146,938,050" calculated by Mr. Elders from November 2008

Statement of Claim, paras. 337-341.

This amount is confirmed by Claimant in its fetter dated 23 April 2013, at 2.

through the date of his witness statement of October 2011 as Attachment 233 to Exhibit C-39,

inclusive, with related monthly invoices to the Respondent at Exhibit C-52.5"°

In its letter dated 23 April 2013, with attached calculations, the Claimant provided the Tribunal

with a “skeleton of its presentation” on the amount of damages.” Therein, the Claimant asserts

that it considers the PPA terminated as of 1 January 2014 due to non-performance by the

Claimant did not previously calculate its damages in two distinct periods, the Tribunal notes that
Exhibit C-38, Attachment 234 did contemplate Tolling Fees for the whole duration of the PPA

term (20 years) under the heading of Repudiation Damages.*”

The Claimant amended its preliminary accounting of the Tolling fees - USD 146,938,050 ~ on
account of not including the interest rate under Article 11.6 of the PPA. Thus, “{ulp to 1 January
2014, the claim would amount to approximately USD 238,059,975, again excluding interest
{see Sheet 1 of the attachment to this letter]. With interest, the claim up to ] January 2013
would amount to USD 248,993,202.00 (see Sheet gor In the alternative, the Claimant asserts
that even assuming that the Respondent’s arguments as to the Claimant’s statements made in the
ProEnergy case are afforded weight in the present arbitration, the damages under Article 11.9 of
the PPA would still amount to USD 205,407,075 without interest (see Sheet 3 to the 23 April
2013 letter), and USD 213,510,647, including interest (see Sheet 4). The Claimant clarifies that
these amounts reflect the “Tolling Fees due from 9 July 2009 (see C38: {Attachment} 157),
which is the date that Ansaido certified ‘Full Speed No Load’ and noted that Grid Connectivity

is necessary for future commissioning milestones”.**

only for the number of days in the month), from November 2008 through the date of Mr. Elder’s

what BEL’s return on investment would be, the Claimant explains that “one should look into the
PPA. Article 11.1 (ii) thereof provides that the return on investment for Balkan would at least be
15% per year.”*" Moreover, the Claimant asserts that, using BEL’s Tariff Analysis, which was

825

confirmed by the Respondent in its Inter-Ministerial Committee Report, ‘the investment

under the PPA is clearly established by the Parties, being USD 140 million.“ According to the

 

Claimant, “[t]he above leads to a damages amount, covering 15% over USD 140 million from
1 January 2014 until 31 October 2027, of USD 280,000,000.00. The Net Present Value thereof

2. The Respondent’s Position

586. The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s claim for Tolling Fees under the PPA fails for three
independent reasons.*” First, the Respondent states that because the PPA is void ab initio, the
Claimant’s claim for Tolling Fees created by that contract must also fail as a matter of law.”

587. Second, even if the PPA is valid, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to

demonstrate that it is entitled to Tolling Fees under Clause 11.9.

588. Third, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant’s claim for Tolling Fees fails as an
“unenforceable penalty” under the law of Ghana.“ The Respondent explains that, unlike
liquidated damages, the Tolling Fees are not a reasonable pre-contractua! estimate of the

852

Claimant's loss.” The Respondent argues that the Tolling Fees “are not in any way tied to

Balkan’s actual Joss in the event of a breach by the Respondent. Accordingly, they are a
penalty”.
589. The Respondent goes on to elaborate on the Ghanaian law governing penalty, followed by its

reasoning for why the Tolling Fees are an unenforceable penalty, namely:

First, the Tolling Fees do not take into account the month operation and maintenance costs
which Balkan would incur in operating the Power Station. The calculation of Tolling Fees
is based on gross revenue, rather than net profits and actual damage.

Second, the Tolling Fees do not compensate for actual Joss because they do not take into
account the additional financial expenditures that Balkan would be required to make to
complete the commissioning process or make the Barge operational

Third, the Tolling Fees do not compensate for actual loss because they are speculative. The
PPA calls for further upgrades and investments over the 20-year period of the PPA, as well
as resets in the Tolling Fee to be negotiated between Balkan and the Government. (See e.g.
PPA Clauses 2; 8; 11.1 and First Schedule.) A 20-year award for Tolling Fees would
clearly be a penalty because it would not be conditioned upon (a) Balkan making the
investments to perform those upgrades; (b) Balkan’s actual performance in achieving these

upgrades; (c) renegotiating rates; or (d) any other requirement of performance or expense

by Balkan under the PPA.“
In the alternative, the Respondent argues that even if the PPA were enforceable, and even if the
Claimant could demonstrate entitlement to Tolling Fees under Clause 11.9, “the Tribunal would
still be required to reject Balkan’s claim for Tolling Fees for the next 20 years under Clause
11.9 as an unenforceable penalty under Ghanaian law’!
In its Post-Hearing Submission, the Respondent elaborates further on the third reason why it
believes that Claimant's claim for Tolling Fees fails. According to the Respondent, the Claimant
“Fs not entitled to Tolling Fees after April 2009 ... [as the Claimant’s] failure to install the RTU
and connect to the Grid after receiving ABB’s RTU proposal in April 2009 precludes its claim

for Tolling Fees under Clause 11.9 of the PPA from and after that date”*”*

3, The Tribunal’s Findings Concerning Damages for Non-payment of Tolling Fees

The Tribunal has concluded that because no power was ever produced by the Power Station,
irrespectively of the questions conceming site electricity and grid connectivity, no Tolling Fees
are owed by the Respondent on this count. Payment would only be due under the PPA if power
were actually supplied or the Power Station was ready to supply it but could not do so for
failure of grid connectivity attributable to the Respondent. None of the requirements were met
as the Power Station was never finally tested and commissioned because of the reasons that
have been examined, which are independent of the failures of the Respondent in respect of the

compliance of its own obligations under the PPA.

It follows that for the Tribunal to award damages to the Claimant in respect of Tolling Fees it
would need to hold that the Power Station was ready for delivering power. The evidence,
however, does not prove that such was the case. On the contrary, Claimant’s submission that
Tolling Fees were due at the very least from 9 July 2009, the date Ansaldo certified the Power
Station running at Full Speed No Load, fails because the Tribunal has not found this
certification to be credible or even properly done. Grid connectivity, while indispensable at the
end of the commissioning process, was not shown to have been the main reason for such failure

although as also found it would have been preferable and helpful to that end. Even if all such

PCA 117830 182

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 201 of 264

Respondent's obligations had been fully complied with, the Power Station would still not have

been able to deliver power.

594, The Claimant also demands damages on account of a return on investment of at least 15% per
year as from 1 January 2014, the estimated date of this Award, and until the end date of the PPA
on 31 October 2027, as provided for under the PPA Clause 11.1(ii). Such minimum return
assumes, however, that the Power Station will be in full operation during that considerable
period of years, as otherwise there would be an unproductive investment which could hardly

justify that return

595. While the Respondent’s argument that no Tolling Fees are owed as a consequence of the PPA
being void ab initio is unsustainable in the light of the Tribunal’s findings, there is some merit
in the Respondent’s view that Tolling Fees are not in any way tied to Balkan’s actual loss in the
event of a breach by the Respondent, and would thus amount to an unenforceable penalty under
Ghanaian Jaw. In fact, the Tribunal will find below that the Claimant is entitled to compensation
because of Respondent’s breach of obligations under the PPA, but that finding is independent of

the claim for Tolling Fees.

i. The Claimant’s Position

In addition, in the alternative to Tolling Fees, and/or to the extent it is determined that the
Respondent has abandoned or wrongly terminated the PPA, the Claimant seeks repudiation
damages, which it submits are “the discounted value of the total Tolling Fees that would
otherwise be due under ... [Clause] 11.9” as is calculated in the “Contract Revenue catculation”
provided at Attachment 234 to Exhibit C-38.“" The Claimant makes no express reference to any

claim for repudiation damages in its Post-Hearing Submission.

2. The Respondent’s Position

 

 

597. The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s claim for Tolling Fees on the basis of repudiation
also fails.“ First, the Respondent argues that because the PPA is void ab initio, there can be no

claim for repudiation as a matter of law."

 

598. Second, and in the alternative, the Respondent contends that even if the PPA were valid, a claim

of repudiation does not exist given the Claimant’s alleged failure to perform under the PPA.“”

 

According to the Respondent, if anyone has repudiated the PPA, it is the Claimant.

599. Third, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant “cannot and does not show ‘an absolute refusal
{by the Government] to perform {its} side of the contract prior to the commencement of this
Arbitration’”; a necessary element to a successful repudiation claim cited by Jeading contract

2 The Respondent argues that “[t]o the contrary, the evidence shows that on

law authorities.
August 8, 2008, the Government provided a Transmission Line to the Project Site expressly so
that Balkan could complete the commissioning of the Power station and conduct Final

Performance Testing.“

600. The Respondent further asserts that it was only after the Claimant commenced this arbitration

that the Respondent sought, and obtained, the Supreme Court Judgment declaring the PPA

unconstitutional and void ab initio.““ In this regard, the Respondent submits that “an

application to the court to determine the validity of a contract or the obligation of the parties

3. The Tribunal’s Findings Concerning Repudiation Damages

The Tribunal is not of the view that repudiation damages are warranted as an alternative to
Tolling Fees or because the Respondent abandoned or wrongly terminated the PPA. Nor is there
room for Respondent's argument that the PPA is void ab initio and thus there could be no

repudiation damages as a matter of law.

The situation is altogether different as explained above. Both Parties have requested the
Tribunal to declare the PPA terminated in the light of the breach of the other Party’s obligations.
Termination is therefore not the result of either Party having wrongfully terminated the PPA bat
rather the result of the Tribunal’s conclusion to bring an end to the dispute, on the basis of the
Parties’ respective requests, and the recognition by the Tribunal that performance under the
contract would serve no purpose at this stage. In the view of the Tribunal, neither Party has fully

complied with its obligations under the PPA.

The nature of this state of non-performance is different for each Party. While the Claimant has
not finally tested and commissioned the Power Station for reasons not attributable to the
Respondent and is thus not in the position to generate and deliver power, the Respondent's
performance failures emerge from the issues concerning site electricity and grid connectivity,
among other that have been discussed. The Tribunal is convinced that neither of the Parties has
refused to perform its obligations, which would be a key factor in establishing repudiation. The
Tribunal has rather found that performance has been materially unattainable in the Claimant's
case and that the Respondent has only partly discharged its own obligations, in an untimely
manner and in the face of technical difficulties that do always not appear to have been

satisfactorily corrected.

The Tribunal is also of the view, as argued by the Respondent, that applying to the courts in
respect of the validity of the PPA does not amount to repudiation. The Tribunal must also note
the Respondent’s assertion that even after obtaining the Supreme Court Judgment it took no
steps to enforce the Judgment pending the outcome of this arbitration. In the Tribunal’s view,
there is room for a determination by the Ghanaian judiciary that is consistent with the

conclusions of this Award,

Repudiation damages are accordingly denied.

C. RESTITUTION DAMAGES
1, The Claimant’s Position

606. In the alternative to Tolling Fees and/or repudiation damages, and/or to the extent the Tribunal

“it claims

determines that the PPA is unenforceable, the Claimant seeks restitution damages.
that its restitution damages exceed USD 40 million, comprising the total amount it claims to

have spend through Zenith Bank, together with monies allegedly spend or incurred by Balkan
us.

607. In its Post-Hearing Submission, the Claimant sets out three elements that must be fulfilled in a
claim for unjust enrichment and elaborates on why each of them is satisfied in the present

case?

a) The Respondent has been enriched or received a benefit: the Claimant contends that this
element is fulfilled insofar as the Barge has been enhanced by BEL and its value has

increased.

b) The enrichment is at the expense of the claimant: according to the Claimant, the said

enhancement and benefit has been at the Claimant's expense.

c) The enrichment is unjustified: the Claimant submits that this element has been satisfied
because the Claimant relied on the Respondent’s opinion that parliamentary approval was not

required and invested in the Barge.**

2. The Respondent’s Position

608. The Respondent asserts that the Claimant has not provided sufficient evidence of the expenses it
purports to have incurred for work it completed; a mere spreadsheet listing its purported

expenses and wire transfer payments was attached to its Statement of Claim and only three

609. The Respondent states that the principle of unjust enrichment requires that:
* the Respondent has been enriched by the receipt of a benefit;
® this enrichment is at the expense of the Claimant;

* the retention of the enrichment is unfair; and
* there is no Defense or bar to the claim."

610. The Respondent goes on to assert three reasons why the Respondent has failed to prove its
unjust enrichment claim. §6 First, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has not
demonstrated “that its alleged expenses resulted in any value to the Government, the
fundamental element of an unjust enrichment claim.”**” In support, the Respondent reiterates its
assertions that the Power Station remains incapable of generating any power and that the
Claimant has not furnished any evidence of successful commissioning and testing of any of the
critical systems on the Barge (the turbines, generator, DCS, fuel tanks, 161 kV GIS switchgear,
transformer, relay protection devices)."*

611. Second, the Respondent submits that the Claimant “cannot ignore its own admission that
ProEnergy overbilled for the work it did, and that much of the ProEnergy’s work had to be
redone.”*** In the absence of any evidence presented by the Claimant that systems on the Barge
have been successfully tested, the Respondent similarly questions the Claimant's invoices for
work done after ProEnergy left the Project Site.°° |

612. Third, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that many of the
expenses for which it seems reimbursement are linked to the Barge. It insists that “[w]ithout

appropriate backup documentation, neither the Tribunal nor anyone else could reach a reliable

conclusion regarding the validity of the expense occurred.*°

In response to the Claimant’s 7 June Letter, the Respondent denies that any interest expenses or
general PPA-related expenses can be recovered as restitutionary damages because they are loss-
based.*” As regards commissioning expenses, the Respondent argues that these are loss-related
expenses and that, since none of the systems of the Barge is actually operable, no benefit has
been conferred to the Respondent,*’ The Respondent also alleges several errors in the
Claimant’s damages calculations. Finally, the Respondent submits that the Claimant is not
entitled to any restitutionary damages for expenses incurred after July 2009, as the Claimant

performed no further commissioning work on the Barge after that date.“

3. The Tribunal’s Findings Concerning Restitution Damages

The Tribunal has concluded that the PPA cannot be enforced in the present circumstances and
thus there is a legal basis to examine the claim for restitution damages. It is a fact that the
Claimant has spent a significant amount of money in its efforts to get the Power Station fo an
operational state. Although the Claimant invokes unjust enrichment to justify its claim under
this heading, the Tribunal does not consider this to be the appropriate legal basis as it has been
concluded above that the requirements for unjust enrichment are not met in this case. In fact as
long as there is no power generation and delivery, the essential purpose and objective of the
PPA, the Respondent cannot be considered to have unjustly enriched itself at the expense of the

Claimant in an unjustified manner.

It is true that in principle, as the Claimant asserts, the value of the Barge has to an undetermined
extent increased in view of the work done and the equipment introduced and this would be at
the disposal of the Respondent for any future project related thereto. This is, however, marginal
to the value of the project as a whole and thus could not justify damages on the basis of unjust
enrichment. The Tribunal is mindful, however, that the Respondent bears some degree of
responsibility for the failure of the Project, not decisive as the Claimant argues but sufficient for

the Tribunal to take it into account in assessing damages.

616. Having considered the Respondent’s non-performance of its obligations in a fully satisfactory
manner, the incidence this has had in not facilitating the final testing and commissioning of the
Power Station that would have been desirable and the eventual increase in costs this situation

has created, the Tribunal will grant to the Claimant a measure of restitution damages on the

 

basis of the Respondent's liability.

617. The evidence submitted by the Claimant in respect of the amount of such damages is difficult to

 

assess. The Respondent has rightly commented that spreadsheets and wire transfers are not in
themselves evidence of the damages sought, thal not all expenses listed can be attached to the
work on the Barge and that even Claimant argued that ProEnergy had overbilled for the work
purportedly done. It is also to be noted that general PPA expenses should not be considered as a
part of restitution damages. In addition, the Respondent notes that to the extent that work at the

Barge stopped in mid-2009 there could be no justifiable expenses after this date.

618.

oa

The Tribunal has carefully considered the revised information submitted by the Claimant on this
count of damages—in particular, the documentation submitted as Exhibit C-59, Attachment 66,
and the lists of alleged expenditures submitted on 1 July 2013 as Attachments III.1(a), H1.2(a)
and HE.S5(a}—and the comments thereon in the Respondent’s 10 July Letter with a view to
determining which amounts can be linked to actual work on the Barge or reasonably related
thereto, and which should be excluded as a result of being general expenses thal could have at
best a remote connection to the work on the Barge. In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimant must be
compensated for expenditures that are directly linked to the existence of the PPA; that have
plausibly contributed to the advancement of the commissioning of the Barge; and that are

sufficiently justified by evidence.

619.

oS

The Tribunal has reviewed records of payment falling within the following broad categories:
Purchase of materials or other items to be incorporated into the Barge; payments to contractors
other than Pro-Energy; payments to Pro-Energy: payroll of BEL’s workers directly engaged in
the commissioning of the Barge; payments for fuel, fuel tanks, site electricity and site internet;
generator rental; maintenance; costs of BEL’s facilities at Effasu; accommodation and food;
inspections of the Barge, the surrounding facilities and transmission lines by BEL; shipping [

costs, freights, and customs charges of goods delivered to Effasu: flights to and from Ghana; ie
helicopter charter; permit fees; project insurance; other insurance covering professional risks

relating to the project operation, payroll administration for BEL’s administrative personnel at

 

the Accra Office; Accra office expenses; Accra office furniture, laptop computers, etc; Accra

office lease and other office-operating expenses (electricity, telephone, cleaning materials,

PCA 117830 189

 

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 208 of 264

printing cartridges, office supplies); other Accra office expenses (security fence, business

‘ cards); consultancy fees; public relations expenditures; taxes; other expenditures.

620. It is evident that not all of these categories of expenditures meet the test established above.

Some expenditures are not even directly linked to the existence of the PPA but appear to have

been made in furtherance of the Claimant’s other business activities. Many expenditures cannot

plausibly be said to have contributed to the advancement of the commissioning of the Barge. In

the Tribunal’s view, only the following categories of expenditures can qualify in principle for

restitution:
¢ Purchase of materials or other items to be incorporated into the Barge;
e Payments to contractors other than Pro-Energy;
¢ Payroll of BEL’s workers directly engaged in the commissioning of the Barge;
* Payments for fuel, fuel tanks, site electricity and site internet;
@ Generator rental;
* Maintenance; costs of BEL’s facilities at Effasu;
* Reasonable expenses for accommodation and food;
* Inspections of the Barge, the surrounding facilities and transmission lines by BEL;
* Shipping costs, freights, and customs charges of goods delivered to Effasu;
© Permit fees; and
© Project insurance.

621. Within each of these categories, the Tribunal had to satisfy itself that the Claimant has met its
“ onus to prove that such expenses were actually incurred, and payments made, in the amounts
alleged by the Claimant. The documentation submitted by the Claimant in this regard was often
ot inadequate. It suffices to describe some of the difficulties encountered by the Tribunal here:
Many payments were not supported by copies of invoices; instead payment slips from banks

t (typically Zenith Bank) were provided. In spite of these evidentiary shortcomings the Tribunal

 

has accepted such evidence to the extent that it was persuaded that a payment was in fact made,

the addressee of the payment was discernible, and the purpose of the payment was apparent.

PCA 117830 190

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 209 of 264

622. In respect of other, i very ial p: s, the only evid i was a

bank ledger that did not allow the Tribunal to trace the addressee of the payment or appreciate

 

the goods or services that were provided in exchange for it. In such cases, the Tribunal could not

be certain that the payment was in fact made to the company, and/or for the purposes, contended

 

by the Claimant. Moreover, in reviewing the bank ledger submitted as Exhibit C-59,
Attachment 70, the Tribunal found that a number of the Claimant's allegations of expenditures
supported by this document were questionable because of the identification of duplicate
claims—several alleged payments in the same amount, made to different entities, appear to have

been justified by reference to the same entry of that bank ledger.

623. Other evidence that the Tribunal did not find satisfactory included hand-written notes by an

unidentified person or entity confirming payment, in lieu of an actual invoice or bank statement.

624. Consistently with its findings above, that the present dispute crystallized in mid-2009 and no
significant commissioning activities took place as of that date, the Tribunal has excluded from
the scope of recoverable restitution damages any expenditures that were incurred as of mid-

2009. The Tribunal is convinced that, as of that time, BEL’s personnel was primarily concerned

 

with preparing legal action against Ghana and its technical work concentrated on preservation

 

rather than improvement of the Barge.

625. On the basis of its review of the evidence, the Tribunal concludes and decides that the amounts

 

owed by the Respondent to the Claimant as restitution damages are USD 7 million and CEDI

 

7.5 million, the latter being roughly equivalent to USD 5 million, totaling USD 12 million. ®*

 

 

 

 

626. The Tribunal must note, finally, that the Claimant’s claim for damages was, as indicated, much
higher than that awarded by the Tribunal, in significant part due to the fact that the damages
claimed included BEL’s payment of interest for loans in US$ and CEDI to Zenith Bank. It is not
unusual that an investment will be financed by means of loaned funds on which interest will be
due—a situation that indeed occurred in this case, as explained by Mr. Crouch’s witness
statement.” While under principles of common law it is possible for a tribunal to allow interest
as a head of damage when damages are awarded for breach of contract, a claimant must not be
at fault insofar the breach of contract is concerned. In this case the Claimant has been found to
have a degree of responsibility in the breach of the PPA, just as the Respondent has. It follows
that it is not justified for the Tribunal to award damages for financial costs as might be the case

866 In converting the CED! amount to USD, the Tribunal has had regard to the historical interbank foreign

exchange rate for USD purchases on 1 July 2009.

if the breach of contract is wholly the result of the default of the respondent. In addition, it is
quite impossible to determine which part of those financial costs relate to expenditures for
commissioning pursuant to the PPA and which relate to expenditures for which the Tribunal! has
decided not to award damages. This claim for financial costs cannot be considered by the

Tribunal in the circumstances of the case.

D. INCIDENTAL DAMAGES
1, The Claimant’s Position

627. In support of its claim for incidental damages, the Claimant submits a letter written by Mr.
Elders to the Ministry of Energy on 21 July 2008. In that letter, Mr. Elders summarized the
expenses BEL allegedly incurred as a result of the alleged unavailability of site electricity,
totaling USD 2,482,000."

2. The Respondent’s Position

628. The Respondent asserts that the Claimant’s claim for incidental damages fails because it is
unsubstantiated.*” In this regard, the Respondent contends that the Claimant “fails to submit
any invoices which would permit the Tribunal to verify that the expenses were indeed incurred
or that the ProEnergy reports are reliable in light of Balkan’s prior admissions that ProEnergy

engaged in improper invoicing, double billing and corrective work”.*”

3. The Tribunai’s Findings in Respect of Incidental Damages

629. The Tribunal has concluded on the facts of the claim that site electricity was faulty,
experiencing frequent interruptions or unavailability for hours and even days. The Tribunal
accepts the Claimant’s position that it was indispensable in these circumstances to have
additional generation capacity available on site to support its commissioning and testing efforts,
including the running of the RTU system (in fact, it bears recalling that ProEnergy had even
requested the purchase of a second generator to this end). The Tribunal would also note that
there is no dispute between the Parties that some expense was indeed incurred by BEL for

purchasing and renting generators to improve site electricity. Given the Tribunal’s conclusion

PCA 117830 192

 

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 211 of 264

above, that the Respondent bears responsibility for the failure to make adequate site electricity
available, the Tribunal is in principle minded to grant the Claimant’s claim for incidental

damages.

630: According to the Claimant, the amount of USD 2,482,000 claimed as incidental damages is
constituted by expenditures for power generation equipment purchase and rental, fuel,
maintenance and repair of equipment and the Jabour cost that BEL expended during periods in
which it could not be productive due to power outages.“ In iis review of the voluminous
documentation provided by the Claimant in support of its restitution claim, the Tribunal
encountered several cost items, and accompanying evidence of payments, relating to each of
these categories—equipment purchase and rental (including generators), jet fuel, repair and
maintenance works and payroll expenditures. To the extent that such payments were sufficiently
supported by evidence, the Tribunal has taken these expenditures into consideration as
commissioning expenditures. The Claimant will therefore be compensated for such expenditures

under the heading of “restitution damages”.

631. Tt is evident that the Claimant cannot doubly recover its expenditures resulting from power
shortfall both as restitution damages and incidental damages. Any amounts restituted to the
Claimant as commissioning expenditures would need to be deducted from the amount of
incidental damages to be awarded. However, the evidence submitted in these proceedings does
not permit the Tribunal to determine whether there are any expenditures resulting from power
shortfall that do not at the same time constitute commissioning expenditures (and may thus
entitle the Claimant (o restitution damages). Generally, it seems to the Tribunal that BEL’s
commissioning expenditures also include such additional costs as it incurred as a result of the

power conditions on site.

632. In the absence of any more specific evidence from the Claimant to the contrary, the Tribunal
therefore concludes that any incidental damages that the Claimant may be entitled to as a result
of power shortfall on site are adequately compensated by the award of restitution damages

pursuant to Paragraph 625.

E. OTHER DAMAGES

633. The Claimant has also submitted a claim in the amount of US$ 2.586.000 as the cost of

replacement of the DCS in the context of its claim for conversion and trespass. While the

“Exhibit C-38, Attachment 109.

PCA 117830 193

 

   

 

go

M-Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 212 of 264

Tribunal would normally regard compensation for the disruption of the ordinary course of
business as justified, in finds that this claim has not been supported by adequate evidence about
the damage allegedly caused. There is no documentation in the record as to whether a new DCS

had in fact been purchased as a consequence of the alleged damage to the equipment on site and

there is thus no evidence ing ac ion to grant co ion for a

value.

The Tribunal must also note that in any event any expenditure relating to this claim would have
been made later than mid-2009, the cut-off period after which the Tribunal has concluded that
no significant commissioning work was undertaken. A new DCS would accordingly not be
necessary if commissioning had in fact entirely stopped and its purchase would thus find no

justification in the light of the Claimant’s genera! duty to minimize damages.

The issue concerning the arrest of Mr. Everhart is one that, aside any personal claims by the
affected person, results in interference with the ordinary course of business. The Claimant
leaves the determination of the damage owed to the discretion of the Tribunal. The Tribunal
decides that the amount of USD 50,000 is appropriate in the context of this interference with
BEL’s conduct of business. The Tribunal in any event expects that Ghana will put an end to any

claims pursued against the Claimant s officers.

THE COUNTERCLAIM FOR DAMAGES

The Respondent has also requested in its Counterclaim that the Tribunal orders Claimant to pay
USD 300,000 for its liability in terms of breach of contract. The Tribunal accepts this
counterclaim in the light of Clause 14.2 of the PPA. Such amount shall be deducted from the

damages owed by the Respondent to the Claimant.

INTEREST

The Tribunal has established that the Claimant is entitled to restitution damages under this
Award in respect of selected expenditures up to mid-2009. Accordingly, interest shall accrue on
the amount owed to the Claimant as restitution damages as of i July 2009, until the date of full

payment.

In view that the compensation awarded as a result of the arrest of the Claimant’s officer Mr.
Everhart attends in essence to his personal inconvenience and corporate interference and not to

pecuniary damages, the Tribunal shall not award interest for the payment owed.

PCA 117830 194

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 213 of 264

639. In determining the appropriate interest rate, the Tribunal has had regard to the Parties’ views,
expressed in the PPA, in respect of the interest rate that is to apply in case of a default of
payment by either Party, According to Clause 11.6 of the PPA, interest is set at a rate
corresponding to the Six-Month LIBOR plus one percent (1%) per annum in case of a failure by
the Respondent to make payment “in respect of fees or otherwise”, whereas Clause 12.3 of the
PPA fixes the same rate “if any amount payable by {the Claimant] is not paid on or before the
due date”. The Tribunal considers that this rate reflects the expectations of both Parties at the
time of the conclusion of the PPA in the event of any delayed payment. and the Tribunal sees no
reason to deviate from this interest rate set by the Parties in the context of the present Award.

Interest shall be compounded annually.

H. COSTS OF ARBITRATION

640. In accordance with Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the costs of the arbitration are fixed as

follows:

Arbitrator Fees and Expenses

Professor Francisco Orrego Vicuiia: USD 352,271.35
Fees: USD 326,700.00
Expenses: USD 25,571.35

PCA 117830 195

 

Case 1:17-cv-00584-APM Document 1-2 Filed 03/31/17 Page 214 of 264

641. The Tribunal is mindful that under Clause 22.2 of the PPA each Party is to bear its own costs of
Jegal representation, and both Parties shall share the costs of the arbitration equally. Given that
the Parties reached an agreement on costs that pre-dates this arbitration, the Tribunal does not
find it necessary to make an order in this regard. The Tribunal accordingly shall follow the

agreement reached by the Parties on costs. The costs of the arbitration are thus to be shared

 

equally by the Parties. Given that the Claimant has paid USD 30,000 more than the Respondent

the Tribunal shall order that such amount be reimbursed by the Respondent to the Claimant.

VU. DISPOSITIF

642. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides and orders as follows:

PCA 117830

The PPA shall be terminated as at the date of this Award.

The Respondent shall pay the Claimant the amount of USD 12 million, in
consideration of the Claimant’s commissioning works at the Power Station.

The Claimant shall pay the Respondent the amount of USD 300,000 for its own
breach of contract as per the Respondent’s counterclaim,

The Respondent shall pay the Claimant an additional amount of USD 50,000 in
respect of the arrest of one of the Claimant’s officers.

The Respondent shali pay the Claimant interest on the amounts awarded in
subparagraph 2 at a rate corresponding to the Six-Month LIBOR plus one percent
(1%) per annum. The Claimant shall also pay the Respondent interest at the same
rate on the amount awarded to the latter in subparagraph 3. Interest shall start to
accrue on I July 2009, Interest shall be compounded annually.

AU other claims by the Claimant are dismissed.

Each Party shall pay half of the costs of this arbitration, which total
USD 1,002,689.29, The Respondent shall reimburse the Claimant the amount paid
by the latter in excess in the amount of USD 36,000.
