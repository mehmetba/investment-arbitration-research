RESPONDEN?T’S REQUEST FOR A CORRECTION OF THE AWARD ON
COSTS :

Whereas, by communication dated 14 February 2012, Respondent requested that a
correction be made to paragraph 52 of the Award on Costs.

Whereas paragraph 52 of the Award on Costs presently reads as follows:

Ordering JUDr. * and My. , jointly
and severally, to pay to Claimant CZK 8,024,742.85 for
Respondent's legal fees and expenses as well as EUR 25,000 for
the reimbursement of Respondent's share of the advance on
costs,

Whereas in its communication dated 14 February 2012, Respondent noted that on the
basis of the content of all the preceding sections of the Award on Costs, it was of the
view that paragraph 52 should read so as to order JUDr., and Mr.

vo pay Respondent rather than Claimant.

Whereas the Arbitral Tribunal determines that the aforementioned reference to
“Claimant” rather than “Respondent” in paragraph 52 of the Award on Costs is due to a

clerica) error.

 

 

73, For the foregoing reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal hereby renders the following:
DECISION

4. The operative part of the Award on Costs, namely Paragraphs 52 and 53 of the
Award on Costs, is hereby corrected to read as follows:
