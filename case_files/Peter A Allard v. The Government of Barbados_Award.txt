1B1, British Columbia, Canada (“Mr. Allard” or “Claimant”), a retired attorney and businessman
with Canadian nationality, represented in this arbitration by Mr. Robert Wisner and Ms. Cara Zacks

destroying the value of his investment.” According to the Claimant, Barbados’ “actions and
omissions violate [its] international obligations to Canadian investors” under the Agreement between

28. On 8 December 2015, the Respondent submitted a report by Professor Wayne Hunte responding to
the Wallace Supplemental Report (“Hunte Supplemental Report”).

Peter A. Allard v. Barbados
Award

In the course of the Hearing and in absence of any objection from the Claimant, the Tribunal admitted
the Hunte Supplemental Report in the record of the arbitration.” The Tribunal also ruled to exclude
the Ries Supplemental Report from the record, but admitted one contemporaneous photograph of

mangrove trees at the Sanctuary that had been attached to the Report (“2015 Photograph”).*

The Tribunal did not make a determination on the Respondent’s request for the exclusion from the
record of the Claimant’s Skeleton Argument at the Hearing and, accordingly, addresses this request
here. The Respondent submitted that the document filed by the Claimant exceeds the normal scope
of a skeleton argument, as it makes certain new arguments in response to the Respondent’s
Rejoinder.’ Overall, the Respondent identified only a few paragraphs that contained such allegedly

new arguments!”

and the content of these paragraphs was reiterated in the course of the Claimant’s
opening and closing statements at the Hearing, without any objection from the Respondent.'! In this
context, the Tribunal does not see what prejudice the Respondent would suffer by the admission of
the Claimant’s Skeleton Argument. Accordingly, the Respondent’s request for the exclusion from

the record of the Claimant’s Skeleton Argument is rejected.

On 9 and 10 February 2016 respectively, the Claimant and the Respondent filed submissions on costs

(“Claimant’s Costs Submission” and “Respondent’s Costs Submission”).

On 7 March 2016, the Parties filed reply submissions on costs (“Claimant’s Reply on Costs” and
“Respondent’s Reply on Costs”).

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

In 1994, Mr. Allard decided to acquire and develop land in Barbados for an eco-tourism attraction.'”
To this end, in October 1996, he incorporated the Barbadian company Graeme Hall Bird
Sanctuary Inc. (“GHNSI”), which in three separate land conveyances dated 1996, 1998 and 1999

Peter A. Allard v. Barbados
Award

acquired the Sanctuary, comprising in total 34.25 acres of land located in the western part of some

240 acres of wetlands on the south coast of Barbados (“Graeme Hall Swamp”).'*

The Sanctuary includes a forest of red and white mangroves, and a lake and ponds connected to the
ocean by a canal.’ A long-established sluice gate located at the end of the canal (“Sluice Gate”) is
claimed as having the purpose of controlling the exchange of water between the wetlands and the

ocean; its exact function at different points in time is in dispute.

Before acquiring the Sanctuary, in 1995, Mr. Allard communicated an initial outline of the envisaged
development to various governmental authorities in Barbados.'® By letter dated 18 July 1995,
Mr. Mark Cummins, the Chief Town Planner of Barbados, informed Mr. Allard that the Barbados
National Physical Development Plan of 1986 (“1986 Plan”)'” designated Graeme Hall Swamp as
“an area for major recreational activity and/or open space” and that, to obtain the required planning
permission, a formal application would be required together with a “comprehensive Environmental
Impact Assessment highlighting the assets of the development, areas of concern, the issues to be

addressed and an environmental management plan for the wetland” (“1995 Cummins Letter”).'*

Between 1996 and 1998, the Government of Barbados commissioned the ARA Consulting Group to
produce two reports setting out the environmental characteristics of Graeme Hall Swamp and
recommendations on its use in the “country’s nature-based tourist programme” (“First ARA

Report” and “Second ARA Report”).'°

Peter A. Allard v. Barbados
Award

On 27 March 1998, the Chief Town Planner granted Mr. Allard “Permission to develop land subject
to conditions.””° One of these conditions was “[t]he submission to and approval by the Chief Town
Planner of an Environmental Management Report which shall address . . . (iii) [the] comprehensive

21

drainage plan of the swamp including the sluice gate.

Mr. Allard submitted an initial Environmental Management Plan on 11 November 1998 (“First
EMP”).” By letter dated 12 April 1998, the Chief Town Planner stated that the report was

23

unsatisfactory and requested a “resubmission.

Mr. Allard submitted an Amended Environmental Management Plan in April 2000 (“Amended
EMP”).

On 27 November 2000, the Chief Town Planner wrote that he was “prepared to advise the Ministry
of Finance that the developer has either discharged all relevant conditions or put adequate measures
in place to address the same conditions” and that he would “recommend to the Ministry of Finance
that with respect to building works, and related ancillary structures such as the boardwalk, pier and

observation huts concessions may be granted.””°

Around the same time, Mr. Allard undertook construction and improvement works on the Sanctuary
site, including building migratory bird ponds adjoining the main lake, an integrated network of
boardwalks, observation decks, aviaries, and the “foundation of a visitor’s centre, a gift shop, public

9926

restrooms, a commercial animal food preparation structure, offices and other supporting elements.
The Sanctuary opened to the public in the spring of 2004.2”

In 2005, a failure at the South Coast Sewage Treatment Plant, operated by the Barbados Water

Authority, resulted in the emergency discharge of raw sewage into Graeme Hall Swamp.”*

Peter A. Allard v. Barbados
Award

In June 2007, Mr. Allard began trying to sell the Sanctuary.”

On 15 April 2008, an amended Barbados National Physical Development Plan, first proposed in
2003, came into effect (+2003 Plan”).*° The 2003 Plan reclassified a zone located to the north of the
Sanctuary that had been allocated to recreational and agricultural uses under the 1986 Plan into two
zones: a “predominantly residential” zone, closest to the Sanctuary, and an “urban corridor” (the
“Zoning Changes”).*!

On 29 October 2008, Mr. Allard announced the closure of the Sanctuary,** which became effective
between December and March 2009.** Since that closure, the visitors centre’s operation has been

confined to its use as a café.**

THE PARTIES’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF
In his Statement of Claim, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal render an award:
(a) declaring that it has jurisdiction to hear Mr, Allard’s claim under the [BIT];
(b) declaring that Barbados breached its obligations under Articles II(2) and VIII of the [BIT];

(c) ordering Barbados to pay monetary compensation to Mr. Allard in the amount of
C$34,630,700 million plus compound interest thereon from November 30, 2012; and;

(d) granting Mr. Allard his costs of this arbitration and costs of legal representation and assistance
in an amount to be determined in a final award.**
In his Reply and Skeleton Argument, the Claimant amends his claim for monetary compensation to

C$29,026,200.%
In defence, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal:

(i) Decline jurisdiction over all claims in relation to the sluice gate on the grounds that the
Claimant was aware or should have been aware of the sluice gate issue and any alleged
resulting damage prior to 21 May 2007 and that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is therefore
precluded under Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT;

(iii) Declare that the Claimant is not entitled to any damages; and

(iv) Order the Claimant to pay all of the Respondent’s costs in connection with these proceedings,
including the Tribunal’s fees and expenses and all legal fees and expenses incurred by the
Respondent (including, but not limited to, the fees and expenses of legal counsel, experts and
consultants).>”

THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS AND THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

In summary, the Claimant’s case is that the actions and inactions of Barbados concerning the

mismanagement of the Sluice Gate and other issues, caused and/or failed to mitigate a significant

degradation of the environment and the “tourist experience” at the Sanctuary, to an extent obliging

the Claimant to close the Sanctuary, and thereby depriving him of the entire benefit of his investment

to accord “fair and equitable treatment in accordance with principles of International Law”

(“FET”) (Article II(2)(a));
to accord “full protection and security” (“FPS”) (Article II(2)(b)); and

During the relevant period, the environmental conditions at the Sanctuary were not degraded,

but either stayed the same or improved.

Alternatively, any degradation as did occur, arose from external causes and the Claimant’s

own actions and inactions.

(iv) In any event, Barbados took appropriate steps for the environmental protection of the

Sanctuary.
(v) Accordingly, Barbados has complied with all of its obligations under the BIT.

(vi) Moreover, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the Claimant’s claims and, in particular, as
formulated in the Respondent’s objection held over from the Jurisdictional Objections phase,”

over the Claimant’s claims relating to the Sluice Gate.

Hence, underlying the claims is a fundamental factual disagreement as to whether the Claimant has

suffered loss or damage as a result of any actions or inactions of Barbados.

Accordingly, the Tribunal first addresses these factual issues in Section A below, before turning to
the alleged breaches of the BIT in Section B and the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections in

Section C.

FACTUAL ISSUES — WHETHER THE CLAIMANT SUFFERED LOSS OR DAMAGE AS A RESULT OF
ANY ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF BARBADOS,

1. The Claimant’s position

The Claimant asserts that, at the time of his investment, the Sanctuary was a “natural wonder” and
“biodiversity treasure” with the “potential to attract eco-tourism if it was highlighted and showcased
to tourists and visitors.”“° Although the Claimant acknowledges the prior existence of certain discrete
environmental issues, such as overfishing by trespassers, neglect and an overgrowth of sour grass,

he contends that GHNSI addressed these issues promptly after its purchase of the Sanctuary.*!

It is claimed that after acquisition the Sanctuary suffered significant environmental degradation that
progressively transformed it into “little more than a mosquito-infested swamp”? by the time of
closure in 2009. The Claimant invokes the circumstances of declines in water salinity, water quality
and biodiversity,** and also complains of “occasional bad odours” and “pools of stagnant water that

attract large populations of mosquitoes.” Relying on the observations of Mr. Ryan Chenery, a

former employee of the Sanctuary, and the conclusions of his environmental experts, Environmental

Engineering Consultants (“EEC”), the Claimant asserts that there was:
(i) damage to the mangrove trees;

(ii) a decline in the number of fish species, from somewhere in the range of 18 to 42 species to

11 species;
(iii) an increase in the number of fish kills (i.e., incidents of many fish dying at the same time);

(iv) a steady decline in bird population and bird species, as concerns the latter from 45 observed

species in 2005 to 35 in 2007 and 30 in 2008; and
(v) a marked decrease in the number of crabs.

The Claimant alleges three causes for this degradation of the environment: the mismanagement of

the Sluice Gate, the 2005 sewage spill and the Zoning Changes.

The mismanagement of the Sluice Gate. The claim is that “most of the damage” stems from the
improper operation by Barbados of the Sluice Gate,*° which was intended to “allow for a proper tidal
exchange between the seawater and the water in the Sanctuary’s swamp,” but remained closed and
non-operative due to lack of maintenance.*” As a result, the wetlands became cut off from the sea
and were gradually transformed from a brackish (mixed salt and fresh water) into a freshwater
system.“* Salinity measured at 19 parts per thousand (“ppt”) in 1987, declined to 8.4 ppt in 2002—
2003 and to 1.9 ppt in 2010.” This reduction, together with a decrease in tidal effects, was detrimental
to the mangrove trees and the many species that rely on the typically brackish nature of a mangrove
ecosystem.” In addition, the inoperability of the Sluice Gate prevented pollutants from extraneous
sources from being flushed into the sea and increased the risk of flooding.*! In contrast, on the very

few occasions (if more than one) when sea water flowed freely into Graeme Hall Swamp, the positive

impact on the water, which turned from “dark”, “stagnant” and “opaque” into “completely crystal

clear”, and on several species of fauna, was readily apparent.*?

Sewage spill. As a single event in 2005, raw sewage contaminated the Sanctuary, curtailing all
environmental tours and educational operations.** The effect of this pollution was exacerbated by the

inoperability of the Sluice Gate.

Zoning Changes. The environmental degradation of the Sanctuary was “compounded” by the
reclassification of lands adjacent to the Sanctuary under the 2003 Plan.** The implementation of the
Zoning Changes is claimed as something that would increase the run-off of contaminants into the
Sanctuary and diminish the quality of the visitor experience at the Sanctuary by reducing the
“tranquillity” of the site.*° The Claimant notes that the Second ARA Report confirms the critical

importance of having a “buffer zone” for the environmental health of Graeme Hall Swamp.*”

The Claimant rejects the alternative explanations for the reduction in water salinity, water quality
and biodiversity at the Sanctuary proposed by the Respondent’s environmental expert, Professor
Wayne Hunte.** Inter alia, the Claimant asserts that Professor Hunte’s opinion that the Sluice Gate
was not an important mechanism for exchange between the sea and the wetlands due to subsurface

exchange, should be disregarded as being inconsistent with:
(i) the position taken by Barbados’ own consultants outside of this arbitration;
(ii) _ the fact that only freshwater species live near the bottom of the Sanctuary lake;

(iii) geologic cross-sections showing that there is a freshwater lens immediately underneath the

Sanctuary; and

(iv) the observed decline in salinity at the Sanctuary.”

2. The Respondent’s position

The Respondent disputes that the Sanctuary suffered any material environmental degradation
between 1994, when the Claimant “first launched his plans,” and 2009, when he closed the
Sanctuary. Alternatively, the Respondent submits that such degradation as did occur, did not arise
from the Respondent’s actions or inactions.°! In particular, Mr. Allard closed the Sanctuary for
business rather than environmental reasons, having come to realize that his project was not
economically viable.

First, the Respondent asserts that, in 1994, the ecology of the site already reflected a series of “pre-

existing physical constraints.”®*

In its original state centuries ago, Graeme Hall Swamp was “part of
a much wider mangrove system which communicated directly with the sea” through an estuary, but
from the early 1700s the wetlands were increasingly separated from the sea through human
intervention, in particular following the construction of a coastal road leaving only a stream linking
the swamp with the sea.° In the 1930s, a gun club built the Sluice Gate across the stream, not “as a
conduit for seawater to enter the wetlands,” but to create and control water levels in “freshwater
shooting ponds.”° Further, in 1972 and 1973, the western section of Graeme Hall Swamp (where the
Sanctuary is located) was dredged for an aborted residential development project, creating a lake and
“exacerbat[ing] the longstanding drainage issues by effectively creating an additional shelf between
[the lake] and the sea.”®’ Finally, in 1984, a tropical storm resulted in a variable build-up of sand
extending up to 130 metres as a beach between the Sluice Gate and the sea; this limited the

interchange of water between the swamp and the sea.**

Hence, it was these human and natural events that caused the transformation of the Sanctuary from
a “typical mangrove ecosystem with an estuary connecting the inland water to the sea” to a
“somewhat fresher ecosystem.” For this reason, it is inappropriate to compare the flora and fauna

of the Sanctuary with that of typical mangrove ecosystems.””

In addition, the Sanctuary’s situation at the bottom of a catchment area of approximately 1156 acres
gave rise to “significant drainage issues,” which hampered pollution discharge from adjacent

agricultural and residential activity.”

Thus, the records from its early days recognize the imperfect environmental health position of the
Sanctuary. The First EMP stated that “[c]omparative data from other mangrove eco-systems within
the Caribbean Basin which have retained their open links with the sea, demonstrates that Graeme
Hall [Swamp] is fish species poor.”’? The Amended EMP and the First ARA Report each documented
fish kills, while the First EMP also referred to a decline in bird diversity.”

According to the Respondent, this much was admitted by the Claimant. In a letter dated 26 February

v14

1996, a representative stated that the wetlands had been “rendered ecologically unsound,” and in a

later letter dated 28 November 1996, the Claimant himself stated that Graeme Hall Swamp was “an

abused and degraded ecosystem.”

Second, the Respondent asserts that between 1994 and 2009 there was no actual degradation in the
environmental conditions at the Sanctuary and that, in fact, they were substantially stable or even
improved.

Water salinity. Salinity measurements used by the Claimant are misleading as they were taken in a

very short monitoring period (in February 2010). Data collected by the Caribbean Coastal Marine

Productivity Program (“CARICOMP?”) confirms that salinity was low in February 2010, but also
shows that “there continues to be inter-annual variation in salinity values” and that “there has not
been a uni-directional transition to fresh water” over the period of the Claimant’s investment.”
Professor Hunte’s opinion is that the low salinity figure of February 2010 was due to the pumping of
freshwater into the swamp by the Sanctuary, in accordance with its policy to pump freshwater from

the springs into the lake to maintain water levels during periods of drought.”

Water quality. Comparing the full available data set for 2002-2003 to 2010, Professor Hunte
concludes that water quality at the Sanctuary has improved over that period with respect to all
parameters.”* Professor Hunte further states that even if the 2005 sewage spill had a negative effect
on the Sanctuary, the effect was not lasting.” Moreover, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant

himself regularly used pesticides at the Sanctuary.*°

Mangroves. Professor Hunte invokes an expert in mangroves hired by EEC in 2010, stating that

“[t]he Sanctuary mangroves were verdant and healthy.”*!

Crabs, birds and fish. Professor Hunte states that there is no quantitative evidence of the decrease in
the number of crabs at the Sanctuary and suggests that if there was a decrease, it would most likely
be due to predation by mongoose and wading birds such as the glossy ibis.** Professor Hunte also
suggests that any perceived reduction of the fish and bird population at the Sanctuary may be due to
methodological flaws in Mr. Chenery’s censuses. Thus, the reduction in the numbers of birds
observed by Mr. Chenery from one year to the next may be the result of the corresponding reduction
in the number of bird census walks.*’ The difference between the numbers of fish counted in 1987
and 2009 may be explained by the fact that the 1987 count was conducted by four highly trained
scientists using more varied methods than those employed by Mr. Chenery in 2009." Professor Hunte

also indicates that fish kills occur from time to time as “natural events”, because periods of heavy

rainfall can cause “low oxygen water at depth to be redistributed throughout the water column,

resulting in fish mortality through oxygen deprivation.”*>

In summary, the Respondent asserts that, “[i]n the absence of any adequate baseline data or
systematic ongoing monitoring data,” the claim that Mr. Allard closed the Sanctuary due to the
environmental degradation of the site and not other reasons is “manifestly ungrounded in fact’** and

is to be rejected.

Third, the Respondent disputes the importance of the Sluice Gate for the exchange of water between
Graeme Hall Swamp and the sea.*’ According to Professor Hunte, since the beach accretion of 1984,
seawater at high tide reached the Sluice Gate canal only exceptionally, during extreme weather

conditions.

Moreover, Professor Hunte’s opinion is that the geology of Barbados ensures that “nearly all
exchange between inland water and seawater occurs subsurface.”*” This exchange is evidenced at the

Sanctuary by:

(i) the fact that the lake maintained brackish water conditions even when seawater could not reach

the Sanctuary overland due to the beach accretion; and

(ii) water testing results showing that the salinity of sub-surface water at the Sanctuary exceeds

that of the lake.”

Accordingly, the Sluice Gate has had little or no impact on salinity during the Claimant’s ownership
of the Sanctuary. In any event, the Claimant is incorrect to claim that since his purchase in 1996 the
Sluice Gate has remained completely closed: in fact, the Respondent during this period has

“maintained the opening and closing of the canal, either by the Sluice Gate or by alternate means.””!

Fourth, the Respondent contends that the Zoning Changes had a positive impact on environmental
conditions at the Sanctuary. The reallocation of the broader area around Graeme Hall Swamp from

an open and major recreational space to a predominantly residential space has no “practical

significance.””? Further, an area significantly larger than the Sanctuary was designated a National
Heritage Conservation Area, ensuring that “additional weight” would be given to “conservation
considerations in Graeme Hall not only when considering proposed development plans for Graeme

Hall itself, but also for areas upstream of Graeme Hall” in its large catchment area.°*

Additionally, as confirmed by Professor Hunte, the Zoning Changes increased the protection of the
Sanctuary, as it is easier to control pollution from “point sources such as commercial operations and
residences” than from “non-point sources” such as agriculture.** And, in fact, there has been no
intervening development at all, apart from one small project the approval of which was subject to the

fulfilment of a number of environmental conditions.°°

Fifth, and finally, the Respondent contends that in fact “the Claimant closed the Sanctuary because
it was hemorrhaging money” due to its “failure . . . as a business.”°° In particular, the Claimant
expected to generate a significant part of his revenue from agreements with package tour and cruise

ship operators, but was unable to secure such contracts.”

3. The Tribunal’s analysis

In this Section, the Tribunal considers whether the Claimant has suffered loss or damage and whether
that loss or damage (if any) was caused by actions or inactions of Barbados.

The Parties accept that the burden is on the Claimant to establish each factor of loss, as well as
causation.

The Claimant’s claim is for the loss of the ecotourism attraction constituted by the Sanctuary.

Following its closure, its operations now are confined to a roadside café.°* The Claimant asserts that

his investment was to “generate revenue from ticket sales and services provided to visitors,”°? and
that he was forced to cease operating this business when cumulative environmental damage resulted
in a “net deterioration into the value for money that the Sanctuary [could] offer visitors.”!° As the
Claimant put it at the Hearing, “without the natural environment, operating the Sanctuary would
essentially be like asking people to visit a zoo without any animals or an aquarium without any
fish.”!!

Following the Jurisdictional Objections phase, the Respondent accepts that the Claimant’s

102

investment “was the business of an eco-tourism site.

Accordingly, to establish loss the Claimant first must establish that there was a degradation of the
environment at the Sanctuary sufficient to render operating the Sanctuary as an ecotourism attraction
impossible or financially unsustainable. This remains an objective enquiry, uncontrolled by

Mr. Allard’s own perception of the degradation of the environment at the Sanctuary.

The relevant period of the alleged environmental degradation for consideration is from the
Claimant’s initial investment in Barbados in 1996 (on his initial purchase of approximately 29 of the
34.25 acres comprising the Sanctuary site)'°* to the closure of the Sanctuary as an ecotourism
attraction in 2009 (“Relevant Period”). The enquiry is whether, by the latter date, the Claimant can
prove a sufficient change had occurred in the environmental conditions at the Sanctuary to justify his

decision to close.

As to causation, the Claimant must show that any environmental damage to the Sanctuary that can
be proved was caused by actions or inactions of Barbados and, in particular, by the mismanagement

of the Sluice Gate.

parameters:

(ii) other water quality parameters;
(iii) the health of the mangroves;
(iv) _ the diversity and health of fish;
(v) _ the diversity and health of birds; and
(vi) _ the health of crabs.
The Tribunal examines each of these parameters in turn.
(i) Water salinity

The Parties’ environmental experts agree that water salinity may be taken as an indicator of the
Sanctuary’s environmental health, as a sharp decline in salinity may harm the mangrove
ecosystem.'* However, the experts disagree as to whether, as a matter of fact, during the Relevant

Period:
(i) the salinity of the Sanctuary waters declined; and

(ii) _ the Sanctuary waters became either entirely fresh or so fresh as to be harmful to the mangrove

ecosystem.!”

The experts agree that salinity is measured by reference to the dissolved salt content of a body of
water, expressed by them in ppt. Divergent classification systems accept that fresh water has salinity
of less than 2 or 5 ppt; brackish water corresponds to salinity between 3 or 6 and 16 or 29 ppt; and
saline water has salinity either 16 or 29 ppt and above.'° The Tribunal need not make findings as to

which of these ranges is definitive at each level.

The Tribunal has before it salinity data from five sources, covering different dates or periods:

affect the average. Using only the values for stations 7A, 7B and 10, which are labeled “lake” by EEC, yields an
average of 1.97 ppt. Additionally excluding the value for station 7A, as does Professor Hunte (Hearing Tr.,
15 December 2015, 1115-1116 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte)), because it is located at the entrance of
the south pond, yields an average of 1.95 ppt.

(v) In 1993, and during the period 2006-2015, salinity data were collected at the surface of the
lake by CARICOMP. The CARICOMP data were submitted to the Tribunal by the
Respondent’s environmental expert, Professor Hunte, in the form of a graph showing average
annual salinity, including: 3.8 ppt for 1993, 1.7 ppt for 2006, 7.7 ppt for 2008, 1.0 ppt for 2010
and 4.0 ppt for 2015."!

91. Relying on data from the Parker Paper, the Cattaneo Report, the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme

water ecosystem.''” In response, Professor Hunte criticizes several of the sources relied upon by EEC
and finds support in the CARICOMP data to deny the occurrence of a unidirectional change in

salinity.''

92. The Tribunal accepts that there is seasonal variation in the salinity of the Sanctuary waters from

lower in the wet season to higher in the dry season. EEC and Professor Hunte acknowledge that this

variation was observed and documented in the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme,'!

the only
occasion on which salinity at the Sanctuary was systematically studied over a period of time.!”° It
follows that, in comparing salinity values in different periods, care must be taken not to overlook the

impact of seasonal variation.

93. Although the Parker Paper and the Cattaneo Report provide salinity figures only for two discrete
dates, the Tribunal attaches significance to the fact that their results are consistent and accepts them
as evidence that the level of salinity of the Sanctuary waters was higher in 1986 and 1987 than in

2001 to 2015.

94. The Tribunal is inclined to reject the criticism levelled against these reports by Professor Hunte.
Professor Hunte’s opinion that the high salinity values of the Parker Paper may be explained by a

“significant storm event”!?!

is speculative and inconsistent with the Parker Paper’s statement that the
measurements were taken in a “period of drought.”!” In any event, such a storm event would only
serve to explain why the salinity values of the Parker Paper are higher than those of the Cattaneo
Report. Moreover, Professor Hunte’s distrust of the values of the Cattaneo Report on the ground that
they are inconsistent with the values recorded during the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme!”
appears to be based on an inapt comparison, as the readings are too distant in time to justify any
assumption that they should be identical or similar. While, as suggested by Professor Hunte, it is
unlikely that a single value (19 ppt) was measured at all depths and locations in the Sanctuary,'** this
circumstance does not suffice to discredit the Cattaneo Report, but merely to suggest that the salinity
value quoted is an approximation. Professor Hunte agreed that the authors of the Cattaneo Report

125

were highly trained scientists,'* and they themselves stated that “[s]alinityf was about 19 parts per

thousand . . . at all depths and stations sampled.”!7°

95. As for the period 2001 to 2015, all sources of information, namely the 2001-2003 Monitoring
Programme, the 2010 EEC Report and the CARICOMP programme, record salinity readings in the
lake and the canal (whether in the wet or dry season) lower than the 19 ppt recorded in the lake by
the Cattaneo Report and the 29 to 34 ppt recorded in the canal by the Parker Paper during the dry

season.'”” Professor Hunte’s hypothesis that the low salinity value of February 2010 may have

resulted from the pumping of fresh water into the Sanctuary by the Claimant’s employees'’* was
raised by the Claimant’s own environmental experts in their early report,!” noting observations of
the level of the lake rising “by several centimetres without the aid of rainfall” during the pumping
event.!*° However, as the direct evidence of the limited capacity and use of the pump to effect such
dilutions militates to the contrary,'*! the Tribunal is unable to find that the values of the 2010 EEC

Report resulted from the pumping of fresh water.

It therefore appears to the Tribunal that salinity levels at the Sanctuary decreased in the period
spanning 1986 to 2015, but the question of whether this change occurred during the Relevant Period

is left open.

The data from the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme, the 2010 EEC Report and CARICOMP must
be examined more closely to answer the latter question. Both EEC and Professor Hunte appear to
accept the data from the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme as reliable. The Tribunal has already
noted that the data from the 2010 EEC Report cannot be explained away based on the pumping of
fresh water into the Sanctuary. As regards the CARICOMP data, the Tribunal accepts the criticism
made by EEC that they are presented “as a graph with no information on sample location, depth or
month of the year.”'*? The Tribunal would have preferred for the CARICOMP data to be better
documented; nonetheless, the CARICOMP data correlates with the salinity values obtained by EEC
in February 2010. Professor Hunte’s indication that CARICOMP tested the surface of the lake!** to
collect “at least ten samples per time period’! suggests that seasonal variation was not overlooked.
Taking account of all of these factors, the Tribunal is of the view that the CARICOMP data may also

be relied upon.

To establish that the decline in salinity occurred during the Relevant Period, EEC compares the

average salinity value measured in the lake and south pond in April 2002 (8.4 ppt) with the average

See e.g. First Hunte Report, p. 5.

Exhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, p. 18: “In periods of drought, the Sanctuary pumps freshwater from the springs
to assist with hydration. Such pumping occurred during the monitoring event.”

value measured in the lake and south pond in February 2010 (1.9 ppt).!** However, while this
comparison is adequate from the perspective of seasonal variation, as both April 2002 and February

2010 were dry months, the Tribunal finds this comparison inconclusive for other reasons.

First, in addition to seasonal variation, the data from the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme and
CARICOMP suggest that there is inter-annual variation in salinity levels at the Sanctuary. The
reports from the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme conclude that there was “statistically
significant” variation in levels of salinity between the 2000 to 2001, and the 2002 to 2003,
investigation periods.'*° The CARICOMP data similarly display inter-annual variation; for example,
with average values of 1.7 ppt for 2006, 7.7 ppt for 2008 and 1.0 ppt for 2010. As a result of this
inter-annual variation, a comparison of data collected at discrete moments in time cannot serve to

show a trend.

Second, salinity values were generally higher during the 2002-2003 investigation period, chosen by
EEC for its comparison, than during the 2000-2001 investigation period.'”’ For the same locations
in the lake and south pond, the average salinity value in drier months of the 2000-2001 period

(February to April) was not 8.4 ppt, but only 4.6 ppt.'**

Third, the Tribunal observes that all the salinity values for the years from 2005 to 2015 recorded by
both EEC and CARICOMP fall well within the range of values measured in the context of the 2001—
2003 Monitoring Programme.

In summary, in its consideration of the available evidence, the Tribunal concludes that although
salinity levels at the Sanctuary decreased over the full period for which data is available from 1986

to 2015, the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that this change occurred during the Relevant Period.

As to the question of whether, by 2009, the Sanctuary waters could be said to have become entirely
fresh or so fresh as to harm the mangrove ecosystem, the actual impact of the Sanctuary’s salinity

levels on the mangrove ecosystem is discussed in Subsections (iii)(v) below.

(ii) | Other water quality parameters

104. Two sets of data for water quality parameters other than salinity are available for the Sanctuary,

namely:
(i) data collected in the context of the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme;'* and

(ii) data collected by EEC in February 2010.'°

105. On each occasion, the water bodies of the Sanctuary were tested for levels of dissolved oxygen,

where higher levels indicate better water quality, as well as biological oxygen demand and levels of
heavy metals, ammonia, nitrate, phosphate, phosphorus, suspended solids, faecal coliform and faecal

streptococci, where lower values indicate better water quality.'*!

106. In their analysis of the data, the Parties’ respective environmental experts draw contrary conclusions:

EEC find that water quality declined “on a number of important parameters,”? whilst Professor

Hunte asserts that water quality improved “for all indicators measured.”'“*

107. These contrary conclusions appear to arise from the experts’ choices in the selection of data for

139

comparison. EEC compared data collected at six sampling stations located in the Sanctuary lake and
south pond in February 2010, a month of low rainfall, with data collected at similar locations in the
drier months of the period 2001-2003 (i.e., February to April 2001 and April 2002).'* In contrast,
Professor Hunte compared data collected at two sampling stations in the lake in February 2010 with
data collected at similar locations during the entire investigation period of April 2002 to March

2003'S or, alternatively, with data from February 2003.'

108. At the Hearing, Mr. Wallace (speaking to the EEC reports) and Professor Hunte defended their

respective methodologies. They agreed that, as with water salinity, there is seasonal variation in the
other parameters of water quality,'*’ as supported by the outcome of the 2001-2003 Monitoring
Programme.'** However, they disagreed as to the factors causing the agreed seasonal variation:
Mr. Wallace insisted on the importance of rainfall (which increases the natural run-off of water, and
therefore contaminants, biological waste and detritus, from the entire catchment area).'*? Professor
Hunte suggested that there may be other factors of seasonal variation, such as temperature and the
“degree of groundwater discharge into the lake.”'*° On this issue, the Tribunal notes that, unlike the
case of water salinity, the reports of the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme do not state a clear

conclusion regarding the impact of rainfall as a factor of seasonal variation.

109. In all the circumstances, on this issue as to the seasonal variation in the parameters of water quality,

the Tribunal concludes that the precise factors are not well known or understood and remain contested
to the extent that no clear finding may be made. On any view, it is apparent that data collected in a
single sampling event of February 2010 does not provide sufficient information for conclusions to
be drawn regarding the evolution of water quality at the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period.
Additionally, the fact that different methodologies yield different and opposing trends suggests to
the Tribunal that, as likely as not, any changes that may have occurred in the water quality of the

Sanctuary during the Relevant Period are within the bounds of seasonal variation.

110. In summary on this issue, given the differences in approach of the experts and the insufficiency of

available data, the Claimant has failed to discharge his burden of proof to establish that there was a
decline in the parameters of water quality (other than salinity) at the Sanctuary during the Relevant

Period.

111. The Claimant separately claims that the severity of environmental issues such as “bad odours” and

“stagnant water,” which existed before he purchased the Sanctuary grounds,'*! increased during the

Relevant Period.'** However, the evidence for this is anecdotal and, wholly apart from the question

of causality, does not support any finding that these issues worsened with time.

(iii) Health of the mangroves

112. On the contested issue of decline in the mangroves’ health during the Relevant Period, the Tribunal

has been presented with:

(i) __ the testimony of Mr. Chenery that, between 2004 and 2009, he “observed red spots beginning
to develop on the leaves of the mangrove trees” and “noted that the leaves began taking on a

2.153

greyish tinge”;

(ii) _ the observation of Mr. Angelo Tulmieri, the scientist employed by EEC to assess the health of
the mangroves in February 2010, that they were “verdant and healthy” and that “the gaps in

the canopy appeared to be small and few in number”;!**

(iii) the testimony of Professor Hunte that the mangroves looked healthy when he last visited the
Sanctuary in 2008;!°5 and

(iv) the tender of the 2015 Photograph, taken by Mr. Ries shortly before the Hearing, as

establishing yellowing of the mangrove leaves.'*6

113. It may first be noted that, at the Hearing, Mr. Chenery recognized that he is not an expert in

mangroves.!*”

114. At the same time, despite his conclusion that the mangroves looked verdant and healthy in February

152

2010, Mr. Tulmieri’s report warned that, if the alleged freshwater conditions at the Sanctuary were
to persist, the mangrove ecosystem “may [be] permanently eliminate[d].”'** Mr. Tulmieri explained

that mangroves “show excellent growth in freshwater but lose the competitive advantage that they

enjoy in saltwater and brackish water.” Once that competitive advantage is lost, “any perturbation
to the mangrove canopy, such as lightning or hurricane, may kill mangroves and may create an
opening or openings in the mangrove canopy for opportunistic plant species to invade.”!© The
Claimants’ environmental experts, EEC and Mr. Thomas F. Ries of Scheda Ecological Associates
Inc., restated and confirmed this assessment in their expert reports.'*' EEC and Mr. Ries further
explained that regular tidal exchange is a key element to ensuring the mangroves’ competitive

162

advantage.'®* Professor Hunte also agreed that mangroves lose their competitive advantage in fresh

water.'®

5. On this issue, on which all the experts appear to agree, the Tribunal accepts that in fresh water (and
in the absence of regular tides), mangroves may eventually be outcompeted by fresh water species.
However, here the Claimant has not demonstrated the fact of any such fresh water transformation of
the Sanctuary over the Relevant Period. That the damage to the mangroves contemplated by this
theory lies in the future was accepted both by Mr. Allard and his environmental experts.’ On no
view has the Claimant established that the danger of mangrove extinction was imminent at the time
of the Sanctuary’s closure in 2009. Six years later, whilst testifying that “we will start seeing death

in the system,”!® Mr. Ries could only point to the yellowing of leaves as a first sign of stress.’ He

extremely healthy” (Hearing Tr., 11 December 2015, 800:24). However, like Mr. Chenery, Dr. Inniss does not
appear to be an expert in mangroves.

recognized that he cannot predict how long the mangroves will survive if current conditions persist,'”

and agreed that it could be over ten years.'® Similarly, Mr. Tulmieri wrote in his 2010 report that
“[t]he conversion from a brackish mangrove wetland to a freshwater wetland in which freshwater

plants replace mangroves may take a long time."

Findings as to the decline in the health of the mangroves over the Relevant Period cannot be inferred

from consideration of the 2015 Photograph taken six years later.

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has not established that the health of the
mangroves deteriorated during the Relevant Period to such an extent as to render the Sanctuary’s

operation as an ecotourism attraction impossible or financially unsustainable.
(iv) Diversity and health of fish

The Claimant asserts that, during the Relevant Period, the number of fish species at the Sanctuary
declined and fish kills became more frequent.'”° EEC links the decline in fish diversity to the alleged
freshwater transformation of the Sanctuary and the upsurge of fish kills to the alleged accumulation

of pollutants in its waters.'7!

To establish the decline in fish species, EEC compares the fish species count of the 1987 Cattaneo
Report, which identified nine marine and nine fresh water species, with counts by Mr. Chenery over
the period 2005 to 2009, during which he identified only three marine and eight fresh water species."
The Claimant also relies on the report by Dr. Karl Watson, an early collaborator on the Sanctuary

project, that 42 species of fish were catalogued at the Sanctuary before 1996.!7*

In the Tribunal’s view, Dr. Watson’s statement about fish is unsupported and, indeed, contradicted
by other evidence. He states that 42 fish species were identified by a Dr. Robin Mahon, whom

Mr. Allard engaged to “conduct a survey of the fish population . . . as part of the preparation for the

submission of the government required Environmental Impact Assessment.”!” Yet Mr. Allard’s two
environmental management plans make no reference to Dr. Mahon, while the Amended EMP

identifies only 21 fish species.'’°

121. Moreover, the very different survey methods used prevent any meaningful comparison between the

fish species counts produced by the authors of the Cattaneo Report and Mr. Chenery. For the
Cattaneo Report, fish “were collected by seine, dip net and minnow trap from the margins of the lake
as well as the sedge marsh and the mangrove swamp.”!” Of the 18 fish species identified, only one

was found through visual sighting.'”’

By contrast, Mr. Chenery relied solely on visual
reconnaissance, in the context of frequent walks through the Sanctuary during which he was also
preoccupied with identifying other fauna and flora and, moreover, was sometimes accompanied by
tourists.!” At the Hearing, Mr. Wallace agreed, with respect to the methods used by the authors of
the Cattaneo Report and Mr. Chenery, that “[t]here is a difference and [that] if you were doing
statistical analysis, they wouldn’t hold up,” explaining that “[y]ou would want to do the same

methodology, if you want[ed] to compare over time.”!””

122. In any event, even if the Cattaneo Report’s and Mr. Chenery’s fish species counts could be

meaningfully compared, they could not suffice to show that any decline in fish diversity occurred

between 1996 and 2010, rather than between 1987 and 1996.

123. With regard to the fish kills, it is common ground between the Parties that they occasionally occurred

before Mr. Allard purchased the Sanctuary.'*’ The experts agree that fish kills may occur in the
absence of any toxic compounds in the water, arising from oxygen depletion, usually when storm
water run-off carrying large amounts of organic debris increases the oxygen demand of the water
column.'*! There is no evidence here that fish kills resulted from the release of any toxic compounds

in the water. The laboratory testing of dead tilapia carried out for the 2010 EEC Report showed that

they “appeared to be in good health” despite some minor, non-lethal health issues,'*? and the 2010
EEC Report identified oxygen depletion as “the most likely explanation of fish kills,”!*° a conclusion
in which Professor Hunte concurs.'* The only exception is that a fish kill anecdotally is reported to
have followed the 2005 sewage spill.'** However, as discussed below, this spill had no lasting effect
on the Sanctuary'*® and accordingly could not be characterised as part of a continuing trend of

increasing fish mortality arising from toxicity.

124. The Claimant has also failed to establish that fish kills became more frequent during the Relevant
Period arising from any increase in the frequency and severity of oxygen depletion episodes (as
resulting, according to EEC, from the accumulation of debris from storm water run-off caused by the

infrequent operation of the Sluice Gate).'*”

125. Indeed, EEC relies upon records of fish found dead kept by Mr. Stuart Heaslet, a consultant and
employee of the Sanctuary, and Mr. Chenery.'** However, the records appear to cover only the years
2000 to 2001 and 2006 to 2009. The largest fish kill (3,000 fish) occurred in 2001, most likely as a
one-off event resulting from works carried out by the Ministry of Transport and Public Works. The
records also show that, although the second largest fish kill occurred in 2008 with 200 dead fish,
more fish were found dead in 2000 (184) than in 2006 (88), 2007 (110) or 2009 (50). Hence, the
records do not show an increase, let alone a significant and constant increase, in the number of fish

kills over the Relevant Period.

186 See paragraph 145 below.
'87 REC summarizes the disagreement as follows:

With no outlet to the sea to allow flushing, and a growing muck layer on the bottom which restricts water
flow, the suspended solids accumulate. Prof. Hunte sees this as a natural event and not related to pollution.
Due to the lack of flushing, we see this as a continual pollutant load that unnaturally accumulates each year.
Poor circulation in the absence of tidal flushing contributes to the low [dissolved oxygen]. The relationship
between high volumes of stormwater runoff and entrained pollutant that cause water degradation is a
primary factor in fish kills.

Peter A. Allard v. Barbados
Award

In summary, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has not established that there was either a
decline in the numbers of fish species or an increase in the frequency of fish kills at the Sanctuary

during the Relevant Period.
(v) Diversity and number of birds

The Claimant asserts that there was a steady decline in bird species and population at the Sanctuary
during the Relevant Period.'*” EEC supports this assertion, first, by comparing the number of bird
species referred to in the 2005 designation of the Graeme Hall Swamp under the Convention on
Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat (“RAMSAR
Convention’) (84) with the number of bird species observed by Mr. Chenery at the Sanctuary from
8 to 13 February 2010 (37) and, second, by noting a decline in the number of bird species observed
by Mr. Chenery between 2005 and 2009.' The Claimant’s estimate of the decline in the bird

population also is based on Mr. Chenery’s observations. '*!

With respect to EEC’s first comparison, in the absence of any information concerning the source or
sources of the bird species count of the RAMSAR designation, the Tribunal is left to assume that this
count includes all of the species reported to have been observed, whether during systematic surveys,
or in individual sightings by bird enthusiasts, over a lengthy period, perhaps running back to when
the Sanctuary was operated as a shooting swamp and measures were being taken to attract wading
birds.'*? On no view, may any such total count of birds ever observed in the Graeme Hall Swamp be
meaningfully compared to the number of birds observed by Mr. Chenery in the Sanctuary within six

days in February 2010.

With respect to EEC’s second comparison, Mr. Chenery’s records for 2009 are to be disregarded, as
data was collected only until the end of March.'® For the earlier years, Mr. Chenery states that, by
walking through the Sanctuary, he observed 45 species in 2005, 44 in 2006, 35 in 2007 and 30 in

2008.'** However, he only recorded sightings of uncommon breeding residents and migratory birds,

excluding common breeding residents;'* in other words, sightings of birds “that visitors pay money
to go see at the Sanctuary.”!°° In differentiating common and uncommon breeding residents,
Mr. Chenery must have exercised a degree of subjective judgment that makes comparisons with

earlier reported populations almost meaningless.

Even if a comparison of Mr. Chenery’s own annual records is essayed, its reliability is uncertain.
Professor Hunte suggested that the decreasing number of bird sightings by Mr. Chenery between
2004 and 2008 may be explained by the fact that Mr. Chenery took fewer bird walks in later years.'°”
At the Hearing, Mr. Chenery confirmed that his records do not distinguish between days on which
he went on a bird walk, but did not see any birds, and days when he did not go on a bird walk.!°8
Mr. Chenery also explained that, in general, the frequency of his bird walks did not vary from year
to year: he would usually walk the same route through the Sanctuary twice a day, five or six days a

week, with limited exceptions.'”

Mr. Chenery also explained that, although he conducted bird walks every single month during the
period 2005 to 2008, for purposes of comparison he used only six months for each year.?” By
contrast, Professor Hunte, analysing Mr. Chenery’s complete sighting notes for all twelve months of
the year, calculated that Mr. Chenery had observed 48 species in 2005, 38 species in 2007, and
36 species in 2008.7" These figures were not challenged by the Claimant’s environmental experts or
by Mr. Chenery.” While the Tribunal understands that Mr. Chenery limited his inquiry to six months
each year so as to render possible a comparison with other years for which only incomplete data is
available, it observes that Professor Hunte’s figures suggest a less dramatic decline in bird species

than those presented by Mr. Chenery.

The Tribunal accepts Mr. Chenery to have been an honest and truthful witness; at the same time, the

Tribunal is aware that it is at the mercy of Mr. Chenery’s memory and that there is no way of telling

Award

whether Mr. Chenery took as many walks, or was as attentive, in later years as when he first started

working at the Sanctuary.

Overall, having examined the methodology following which Mr. Chenery’s bird records were
collected, the Tribunal concludes that it is not established that there was a decrease in bird diversity
at the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period. Nor do Mr. Chenery’s records establish a decrease in
the bird population. In any event, on no view did the Claimant establish a reduction in bird diversity
and population such as to render the Sanctuary as an ecotourism attraction impossible or financially

unsustainable to operate.
(vi) Health of crabs

The Claimant asserts that the health of crabs at the Sanctuary was also affected,” based on
Mr. Chenery’s testimony that in 2009 he saw fewer fiddler crabs at the Sanctuary than previously
and his record of one dead fiddler crab and 22 dead blue land crabs found at the Sanctuary between

April and August 2009.7"

Even accepting Mr. Chenery’s observations made during a brief period in 2009, there is no basis to

link any decline in these sightings to a pattern of environmental deterioration of the Sanctuary.

As to blue land crabs, the Tribunal is inclined to agree with Professor Hunte’s opinion that “[t]he
reporting of blue crab kills in a single year is clearly not evidence of a decrease in number over

205

time.” Additionally, the Claimant has not shown that the blue land crab deaths were related to his
grounds of complaint in this arbitration. Indeed, and to the contrary, the laboratory analysis of blue

land crabs showed that they “ha[d] no significant pathogens, lesions, or remarkable features.”?°°

The Tribunal also cannot conclude from Mr. Chenery’s impressions alone that the population of

fiddler crabs decreased.

In any event, several theories have been suggested by the Parties’ experts to explain a possible

reduction of the fiddler crab population, including the lack of tidal exchange (which, in the

Claimant’s view, would suggest a link to the mismanagement of the Sluice Gate),””’ predation’ and

distributional changes,””

all of which are theoretically plausible causes for a result that has not been
demonstrated. As the burden of proof lies on the Claimant, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that
there was a decline or that a possible decline in the fiddler crab population arose from any

environmental damage during the Relevant Period, wholly apart from the question of its cause.

(vii) Conclusion

139. In his first witness statement, Mr. Allard stated that the “environmental degradation has been

occurring slowly and [was] not always perceived by tourists,” but that “unless Barbados reverses its

course of action, [this would] become readily apparent to most visitors.”?!° The Claimant has not
established in these proceedings that the factual premises of this statement are correct. As detailed
above, in respect of the six aspects of environmental health identified, namely water salinity, other
parameters of water quality, the health of the mangroves, the diversity and health of fish, the diversity
and number of birds, and the number of crabs, the Claimant falls short of establishing material
deterioration during the Relevant Period, let alone to the extent that would be apparent to one-time

sitors. It follows that the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to establish that his decision to

 

cease operating the Sanctuary as an ecotourism attraction arose out of any relevant degradation of

the environment at the Sanctuary.

(b) Factual analysis — Causes of the alleged degradation

140. As the Claimant fails to establish that there was a degradation of the identified features of the

Sanctuary during the Relevant Period and that, as a consequence of such degradation, he incurred
loss or damage, the case falls at the first factual hurdle. Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness,
and because the Parties made detailed submissions on the question of whether the alleged
environmental degradation was caused by actions or inactions of Barbados, the Tribunal addresses

these submissions here.

141. In the course of the arbitration, the Claimant has asserted that the following actions or inactions of

Barbados caused the alleged degradation of the environment at the Sanctuary: (i) the failure to

Award

remedy the 2005 spill from the South Coast Sewage Plant;!' (ii) the Zoning Changes;!” and (iii) the
mismanagement of the Sluice Gate.”!* Each of these alleged causes of environmental degradation is

addressed in turn below.
(i) — Sewage spill

In the Claimant’s Statement of Claim, the 2005 sewage spill from the Barbados South Coast Sewage
Plant was pleaded as a direct cause of environmental degradation during the Relevant Period, in that
it “had immediate negative effects on the Sanctuary’s operations,” which Barbados “never
remediated.”?!4 This claim was reformulated during the Hearing in terms that:

the point about the South Coast Sewage Plant is as follows: If there is an emergency discharge

from the South Coast Sewage Treatment Plant, that is supposed to go out the canal. If [the] sluice

gate is blocked, as it was in 2005, that discharge can flow out of the canal and there will be some

damage. Now, there’s a dispute about how much damage there was. The relevance of the incident

is as follows. It’s not a claim that there was a spill in 2005, and that we’re claiming for that spill

[. . .]. The point is that that spill raised a red flag that made the need to repair the sluice gate
urgent. It was a sign of what can happen if the sluice gate was not repaired. 7!

Effectively, counsel thereby abandoned the separate head of claim, stating that the Claimant does not
identify that any action or inaction of Barbados directly related to the 2005 spill caused the alleged
degradation of the environment at the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period. Rather, the Claimant’s
closing position is that the 2005 spill illustrates the kind of damage that could be caused to the

Sanctuary if the Sluice Gate were not repaired.

It follows that the Claimant’s argument in respect of the 2005 spill is subsumed in his claim of alleged
mismanagement of the Sluice Gate. Even in that context, the reformulation does not advance the
claims as it is directed merely to the possibility of future harm that may (or may not) arise through

mismanagement of the Sluice Gate.

Further, on its own terms, there is no more than anecdotal evidence of the deleterious effects of the

2005 spill. Mr. Heaslet’s vague testimony regarding the spill’s alleged negative impact?!° and EEC’s

most improbable hypothesis that the spill could explain the discovery of dead gastropods at the
Sanctuary seven years later in 2010?" fail when weighed against the fact that the water quality tests
conducted at the instigation of the Barbados Water Authority within days of the spill failed to reveal

any environmental damage.?!*

It follows that the 2005 sewage spill does not explain any degradation of the environment at the

Sanctuary or justify Mr. Allard’s later closure of the Sanctuary in 2009.
(ii) Zoning Changes

The claim is that damage caused by the mismanagement of the Sluice Gate “will be compounded by

new residential development that is due to occur” in the area affected by the Zoning Changes.”

As with the sewage spill, so expressed this head is merely impleaded to support Sluice Gate issues,

and does not stand as a separate claim.

Somewhat confusingly, the ground arising from the Zoning Changes provided for in the 2003 Plan
is maintained as enabling future development that would have been prohibited under the 1986 Plan,

220

and that necessarily will increase the run-off of contaminants into the Sanctuary.

Although the Respondent disputes that the adoption of the 2003 Plan diminished the environmental
protection of the Sanctuary,”! it suffices to reject the claim on the ground that the Claimant has not
demonstrated that the adoption of the 2003 Plan has caused any environmental damage to the
Sanctuary. The Claimant has established neither that the quality of water at the Sanctuary decreased
during the Relevant Period, nor that the flora and fauna of the Sanctuary suffered due to a decrease
in water quality during that period.?”” The Claimant has also not shown that any significant
previously-prohibited development has been allowed in the vicinity of the Sanctuary after the

adoption of the 2003 Plan. Indeed, Mr. Allard confirmed in his examination at the Hearing that the

7 Exhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, pp. 51-52: “Benthic sampling in February 2010 indicated that some ‘sudden

disturbance’ had killed the gastropods in 8 of 10 locations, a finding consistent with the impact of [a sewage spill].”

apprehended development has not yet taken place.?”* Even if the Zoning Changes were to result in
new development, there is no proof on the record that it would have the negative effects the Claimant

alleges.

151. It follows that the Zoning Changes are untenable as grounds explaining any degradation of the
environment at the Sanctuary or justifying closure of the Sanctuary in 2009 either on a stand-alone

basis or in support of Sluice Gate issues.
(iii) The Sluice Gate

152. The claim is that Barbados’ failure to adequately maintain and operate the Sluice Gate to allow the
ingress of seawater and the egress of contaminants was the principal cause of the alleged

environmental degradation at the Sanctuary.?4

153. Based on the record of this arbitration, the Tribunal concludes that, before the mid-1990s, the Sluice
Gate was opened three times per week. However, by 1997-1998, the Sluice Gate was opened less
often due to the deterioration of its structure and the accretion of the beach, which required the
frequent excavation of a channel between it and the sea.”° By October 2005, the Sluice Gate had

become “inoperable.”?” It was jammed in a slightly open position, and blocked by an artificial

23 Hearing Tr., 9 December 2015, 281-283 (examination of Mr. Allard). See also Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015,
1534:20-22 (Claimant’s closing statement): “We recognize that the amount of development that has occurred so
far is limited, and that is what the record shows.”

Hearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 38:7-9 (Claimant’s opening statement): “It’s trying to make it appear that any
problems at the Sanctuary are due to anything other than the sluice gate.”

25 Exhibit C-56, First ARA Report, October 1997, pp. 4-4, 5-5:

The sluice gate used to be opened three times per week. [. . .] This schedule has not been regularly adhered
to in recent years. In October 1996, responsible Ministries agreed that the sluice gate would be opened
twice a week. [. . .] The sluice gate has historically been operated frequently [. . .]. This operational practice
has become less and less frequent in recent years due to deterioration of the gate structure [. . .]. In addition,
movement of sand along the beach rapidly books the canal between the sluice gate and the sea, and the sand
buildup requires frequent and extensive excavation to provide proper flow.

Exhibit C-57, Second ARA Report, January 1998, p.11-6:
The channel structure and sluice gate is currently located on the beach well up from the normal high tide
level [which] means that a channel must be regularly excavated through the sand to provide discharge flow

to the sea. Chronic shortages of equipment or unavailability of equipment often means that the sluice gate
is not operated in an acceptable manner [. . .].

Exhibit R-88, Letter from Harry Roberts to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Public Works, 5 October
2005: “The condition of the sluice gate at Worthing beach continues to deteriorate; a portion of one of its
supporting concrete columns has broken off and is now lying on the beach . . . the gate is now inoperable”; Exhibit
R-71, Minutes of the Graeme Hall Stewardship Committee meeting of 17 October 2005, 4 November 2005: “[The
Sluice Gate is] severely damaged”; Exhibit R-89, Letter from Harry Roberts to the Permanent Secretary of the

inistry of Public Works, 24 May 2006: “The present Sluice Gate has . . . been repaired [since January 2004] but
is still inoperable”; Exhibit C-72, Draft Master Plan for the Graeme Hall Ecosystem, September 2007, p. 4: “The
effective operation of the sluice gate has been compromised by sand secretion and maintenance problems in the

Award

sandbar, which could only be removed by severe storms or manually with the use of heavy
machinery.”” There is evidence that the sandbar was removed by Government workers once in
October 2005” and again in August 2009.” In summary, it appears that the Sluice Gate was opened
irregularly between 1997 and 2004, and on no more than a handful of occasions between 2005 and

2009.

154. At paragraph 102 above, the Tribunal found that salinity levels at the Sanctuary decreased from 1986
to 2015 (although there is no conclusive evidence that this change occurred during the Relevant
Period). The question is therefore whether this decrease in salinity was caused by the irregular and

infrequent operation of the Sluice Gate.

155. It is uncontroversial that the Sluice Gate is presently the sole overland connection between the
Graeme Hall Swamp and the sea. The Claimant and his environmental experts submit that the Sluice
Gate is accordingly the main (and, possibly, the only) way in which saline water enters the water
bodies of the Sanctuary.”*’ In contrast, the Respondent argues that “subsurface entry of saline water
is by far the most significant way in which salt enters the [Sanctuary] lake.”?*! Professor Hunte
explains that, even if the Sluice Gate had been regularly operated, it would have been ineffective in
determining salinity in the Sanctuary lake, because starting in 1984-1987 the beach on which the

Sluice Gate is located became too wide to permit the regular ingress of water.”

Dr. Lorna Innis).

227 Chenery Statement, {f 9-10:

Due to lack of maintenance, the sluice gate does not function at all and remains closed, which prevents

The Tribunal does not exclude that, during the Relevant Period, seawater could reach the Sanctuary
lake through the Sluice Gate if the latter was opened under the right conditions. Mr. Chenery and
Mr. Heaslet both testified to seeing seawater enter the canal through the Sluice Gate in the period
from 2000 to 2009, whether by flowing under the Sluice Gate when it was open or over it when it
was closed.”*3 Mr. Chenery also testified to having seen what appeared to be the mixing of seawater

with the waters of the lake,?**

and Mr. Wallace provided a plausible explanation for how seawater
entering through the Sluice Gate could flow sufficiently far up the canal to mix with the lake
waters.”* It is also clear, however, that, due to the width of the beach during the Relevant Period,
seawater did not reach the Sluice Gate on a daily basis. The Claimant submits that seawater could
enter the lake during “episodic periods of high tide,””*° while the Respondent argues that this could
only occur during “extreme storm surges.”?>7 When the beach was widest,”** in the mid-1990s, the
First and Second ARA Reports noted that “ocean waters could pass into the system” through the
Sluice Gate during periods of “sufficiently high tide (primarily meteorological events combined with

high astronomical tide),” estimating the frequency of the mixing at five or six times a month.”

accretion. Since 1984, seawater at high tide has been unable to reach the sluice gate and therefore seawater
could not have entered the Sanctuary lake through the sluice gate canal, except perhaps during extreme
weather events at times when beach width was narrowest. Operation of the sluice gate would have been
ineffective in determining salinity in the Graeme Hall Sanctuary lake since 1984.

enough—right?—that additional oceanographic and weather features could get it close to the sluice gate or
near the sluice gate, and I’ve said that repeatedly. But those combination of events are going to be very
rare.

Peter A. Allard v. Barbados
Award

In any event, the question here is not whether, on occasion, seawater would reach the Sanctuary lake
through the Sluice Gate, but rather, whether the passage of seawater through the Sluice Gate was a
significant component in maintaining the salinity of the Sanctuary lake, such that the irregular and
infrequent operation of the Sluice Gate would cause a non-negligible decrease in salinity. In the

Tribunal’s view, the Claimant has failed to show that this is the case.

First, while the Claimant contends that the Respondent and Professor Hunte created the theory that
the lake’s salinity is maintained through subsurface exchange “solely for the purpose of this

240

arbitration, the Tribunal finds ample support for this theory in documentation pre-dating the

commencement of these proceedings:

(i) The 1987 Cattaneo Report stated that “[s]eawater, no doubt, intrudes into the swamp through
the porous bar separating the sea from the lake and swamp area, and this would contribute to

dl

the high salinity of the [Sanctuary] lake . .

(ii) The 1996 Barbados Water Drainage Study explained that, while the watershed area of the
Graeme Hall Swamp has significantly reduced due to the constriction of the highway, “the
total inflow of water to the swamp has likely remained fairly constant due to sub-surface flow

242

to the wetland area.

(iii) The First ARA Report of 1997 stated that “[bJore holes from Graeme Hall Swamp indicate
that as the layer of coral extends outward under the sea, its permeability produces an interface
between sea water infiltrating inland and fresh rainwater percolated through coral to the
underlying oceanic deposits”? and that “Graeme Hall Swamp . . . contains the hydrological
attributes necessary to maintain a coastal wetland mangrove ecosystem with . . . adequate

saline water from underground sources.”** It also stated that the results of water tests
conducted in December 2016 were consistent with the conclusion that “the primary
mechanism providing saltwater to the swamp . . . was saltwater intrusion through porous

geological formations separating the ocean and the swamp.”*45

(iv) The Claimant’s First EMP of 1998 referred to the “upward welling of saltwater into the

brackish lake from below.”

159. Professor Hunte was also clearly aware of the function of subsurface exchange before preparing his

expert reports in this arbitration. In his comments on the 2010 EEC Report, prepared for Barbados
outside of this arbitration,” Professor Hunte found it “important to note that, in Barbados, most of
the inland water that reaches the coastal zone does so as groundwater (underground) discharge rather

than overland run-off, and that seawater intrusion inland can also occur underground during high

tide.”248

160. Second, the Claimant was not able to disprove that subsurface exchange contributes to the salinity of

the Sanctuary lake. His environmental experts, Messrs. Wallace and Ries, agreed during the Hearing
that there is a subsurface flow of water from the sea to the Sanctuary when the tide is rising? and
that this could, at least theoretically, result in water exchange with the lake.*° Mr. Wallace further
indicated that the only way of knowing whether the water that reaches the lake is saline or freshwater

is “to drill a hole and test it.”?*!

161. Yet the Claimant’s environmental experts did not conduct such tests on the Sanctuary grounds. While

Well, I mean, it says ‘it is likely that the inflow to the swamp will remain fairly constant due to subsurface
flow.’ There is no arguing that, that these—the tides go up and down as they have and will continue to do,
and that tide rising forces a wave underground inland. And then as the tide recedes, the wave comes back.
[. . .] So, I don’t disagree with the statement.

A. I believe that it’s possible that water can come up and enter the lake if the conditions are right, but

brackish water that might enter.

Q. But it is theoretically possible?

A. Yes. If the tide is high enough and the area is dry enough, the freshwater is dry enough, it could do that.

indicated that “the freshwater lens [is] above the saline-freshwater transition at all times except at
ground surface adjacent to the ocean seawater””** and accepts Professor Hunte’s explanation that
“Ta]s the sub-surface freshwater (groundwater) approaches the sea, it rises closer to the surface and
mixes with the sub-surface seawater, creating the brackish water that exists immediately below the
surface at locations such as Graeme Hall [Swamp].”?™ In contrast to EEC, Professor Hunte was able
to produce the CARICOMP data, which shows, on the basis of salinity measurements taken in bore
holes dug at locations adjacent to the Sanctuary lake, that the salinity of the water below ground was

consistently higher than the salinity of the lake surface in the period from 2006 to 2015.

Third, while, as noted in paragraph 93 above, the level of salinity of the Sanctuary waters was high
in the mid-1980s, the record shows that, in all of the periods when the Sluice Gate was operational,
it was primarily used to flush water out of the Graeme Hall Swamp and was therefore typically
opened at low tide and closed in the presence of the conditions (whether simply high tides or high
tides combined with extreme storm events) that might have brought water into the Sanctuary. From
1947 to 1970, the Sanctuary grounds belonged to a gun club,?** which operated the Sluice Gate to
maintain constant water levels, presumably, to ensure that the water levels did not exceed those
attractive to wading birds. The 2010 EEC Report thus indicates that in those days the Sluice Gate
“was opened only at low tide to control the water level in the shooting pools.”?*” Other documents

indicate that, more recently, the Sluice Gate was typically opened at low tide, either to prevent

from the lagoon [.

flooding”** or to flush out debris.”® It is therefore unlikely that ingress of seawater through the Sluice

Gate was a significant component to the maintenance of the salinity levels found in the mid-1980s.

163. Finally, the Tribunal notes that any differences between the Sanctuary and a natural mangrove
ecosystem, as well as any general decline in salinity and the predominantly freshwater benthic
community found in the Sanctuary lake by EEC, can in all likelihood be explained by the fact that
Graeme Hall Swamp, formerly an open estuary, was cut off from the sea with the construction of the

coastal road in 1715.7

164. Accordingly, even if the Tribunal had been persuaded that there was a degradation of the environment
at the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period consisting of, or due to, a decrease in salinity (which it
was not), it could not have concluded that such decrease was caused by the mismanagement of the

Sluice Gate.

165. As to the Claimant’s submission regarding the accumulation of contaminants in the Sanctuary waters.
due to the mismanagement of the Sluice Gate, the Tribunal admits the possibility that the prolonged
closure of the Sluice Gate may cause a build-up of contaminants and, in particular, of large debris.
Professor Hunte recognized during the Hearing that such debris would take time to break down,
dissolve and be flushed out subsurface.”°! However, as indicated in paragraphs 104-111 above, the
Claimant has failed to demonstrate that there was an actual deterioration of the water quality at the

Sanctuary during the Relevant Period.

258 Exhibit C-97, 1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study, p. 2.22: “The gate is operated on an ‘as required’ basis
in order to drain excess water from the swamp . . . Typically, the gates are opened at low tides . . .”; Exhibit R-41,
Letter from Baird & Associates to the CZMU, 5 May 2010: “Baird completed a review of the operation of the
[Sluice Gate] in 2004, and found that it was typically operated 10 to 15 times per month, reducing the water level
in the impoundment by 100 to 150 mm on each opening” (emphasis added); Exhibit C-56, First ARA Report, p.
4.4: “The sluice gate used to be opened three times per week during low tide periods to allow floodwaters to drain
to sea.”

29 Exhibit C-97, 1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study, p. 2.22:

Historically, the outlet canal to the sea has frequently silted up and the poor maintenance and operation of
the sluice gate lead to stagnation of the water in the swamp [. . .]. However, a major clean-up operation by
the Ministry of Transport and Works in the mid 1980’s (sic) and the regular operation of the sluice gate at
low tides has resulted in better water quality.

(iv) Conclusion

166. For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that, even if it had found that there was a degradation of

the environment at the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period (which it did not), it would not have

been persuaded that such degradation was caused by any actions or inactions of Barbados.

ALLEGED BREACHES OF THE BIT

167. The Tribunal has found that the Claimant’s claim fails at its factual threshold as the Claimant has

failed to establish any loss or damage to his investment attributable to any actions or inactions of
Barbados. Even if the Tribunal were to find that Barbados breached any of its BIT obligations, there
would therefore be no loss or damage arising from such breach. However, and having regard to the
exhaustive compilation of the Parties’ pleadings and the joinder of issue, the Tribunal regards it as

appropriate to address the breaches alleged.

168. Accordingly, the Tribunal turns to consider the Claimant’s claims of breach by Barbados of various:

obligations arising under the BIT as noted in paragraph 51 above, namely breaches of the FET and
FPS standards, as well as of the obligation not to expropriate the Claimant’s investment except in

accordance with the conditions set out in the BIT.

made representations to the investor that the investor relied upon to his detriment” and amounts to a

breach of the FET standard.”

In response to the Respondent’s contention that the FET standard of the BIT corresponds to the
minimum standard of treatment of aliens under customary international law and should be interpreted
in the same way as Article 1105 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), the

Claimant argues as follows:

(i) Unlike Article 1105 of the NAFTA, Article II(2)(a) of the BIT does not have a heading that

refers to a minimum standard of treatment.?°

(ii) | The wording of Article II(2)(a) of the BIT is “very much consistent with the wordings of most
[bilateral investment treaties] that contain an autonomous [FET] standard which protects

legitimate expectations.”

(iii) There is no binding interpretation of Article II(2)(a) of the BIT, as is the case for Article 1105
of the NAFTA.**7

(iv) In any event, the case law interpreting Article 1105 of the NAFTA has “made it clear that

customary international law has evolved to protect legitimate expectations.”?**

The claimed breaches are that Barbados denied Mr. Allard FET by making representations that it
would maintain the Sluice Gate and generally “uphold its environmental policies, particularly those
that reflected a commitment to conservation and protection of the biodiversity of the Sanctuary,” and
then failing to act in accordance with those representations.”

Barbados undertook to maintain and operate it appropriately by and in the terms of the Chief Town

responsibility for the maintenance and operation of the Sluice Gate.?”*

175. In this respect, the Claimant first asserts that the control of the Sluice Gate is “inherently a matter of

public authority” because it is located on State land and because its operation affects both the

management.”*** The Amended EMP also indicated that Barbados’ “drainage study condition”

for the project was fulfilled through the 1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study.”*

Barbados gave its unconditional approval to the Amended EMP, including its proposals
regarding drainage and responsibility for the Sluice Gate, through letters dated 12 September
and 27 November 2000 from the Town and Country Planning Office.** The 12 September
letter indicated that, “subsequent to the approval of the drainage and storm water management
plan . . ., the relevant conditions attached to the granting of the planning permission may be
deemed to have been satisfactorily discharged.””** The 27 November letter confirmed the
satisfaction of all conditions.**° GHNSI accordingly reported in a letter dated 19 March 2001
to the Chief Town Planner that it had “adequately fulfilled the obligations for planning
permission that related to drainage and storm water management”*’ and the Chief Town

Planner did not dispute this at the time.”**

Prior to issuing his approval, the Chief Town Planner also consulted the Coastal Zone
Management Unit of the Ministry of the Environment (“CZMU”), which reported, in a
memorandum dated 16 June 2000, that “it is the government’s responsibility to ensure

acceptable water quality.””°

The Claimant draws these circumstances together to claim that he had a legitimate and reasonable

expectation within the FET obligation that Barbados would adequately maintain and operate the

Sluice Gate, and keep the “buffer zone” around the Graeme Hall Swamp “regardless of other

amendments that might be introduced in a future version” of the 1986 Plan.?” He asserts that the

public hearings that took place before the release of the formal 2003 Plan “gave no indication of the

elimination of the [“buffer zone”].

177. The Claimant invokes also Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties? which

provides that in the interpretation of a treaty “there shall be taken into account, together with the
context . . . any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relation between the parties.” The
Claimant argues that, in “interpreting the scope of the standards of treatment,” the Tribunal should
consider “the obligations with respect to the Sanctuary that Barbados assumed in its environmental

treaties.”

The Claimant emphasizes that he does not allege a breach of any treaties other than the
BIT, but argues that Barbados’ environmental treaty obligations “confirm the reasonableness of...

Mr. Allard’s expectations that are protected under the FET standard.”?**

1105(1) of the NAFTA does “not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required
by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens,” and Article II(2)(a) of
the BIT is materially identical to Article 1105(1) of the NAFTA and should be understood in the

same way.*”

181. The customary international law obligation to provide FET has a “very high threshold” that relegates.

“legitimate expectations” to a secondary role.*”' Although the subjective expectations of the investor
may be taken into account in assessing whether there has been a breach of the State’s obligation to
refrain from unfair and inequitable treatment, such expectations “are not in themselves a source of
obligations.”*”? It follows that if a Claimant (as here) alleges no breach of the FET standard apart
from his claim “concerning an alleged breach of his “expectation’,” his claim under Article II(2)(a)

of the BIT must fail“

182. Given its status as customary international law, the scope of the FET standard cannot be expanded

in the absence of consistent State practice and opinio juris. Here, the Claimant has provided no
evidence that States have accepted as their legal obligation the expansive notion of “legitimate

expectations” espoused by the ad hoc investment tribunals that he cites.

183. Whether arising under customary international law or a “bare” treaty standard, to give rise to a

302

305

violation of “legitimate expectations”, a representation must be all of:

(i) clear and explicit;

(ii) made by a State official of sufficient authority, such as to generate reasonable reliance by the
investor;

(iii) made in order to induce the investment;

(iv) have been relied upon by the investor to make the investment; and

185. Further, all of the alleged representations and circumstances giving rise to a legitimate expectation,

Mr. Allard’s decision to invest. *°° On the Claimant’s own account, he committed to invest in 1994,

In any event, as to these so-called “representations”:

(ii)

(iii)

the 1986 Plan was a “flexible policy tool” requiring revision every five years due to the
“dynamic nature of the planning process” and containing “no guarantee that the Respondent
would freeze land designations . . . forever,” while the 2003 Plan was adopted in an “open,
inclusive and transparent manner” and, in any event, did not reduce the overall protection of

the Sanctuary (as to which, see paragraphs 77-78 above);**

the 1995 Cummins Letter contained a “general policy statement regarding the Chief Town
Planner’s approach to zoning in environmentally sensitive areas,” but no “specific
representations regarding actions the Respondent might take with regard to environmental
management of the [Sanctuary], over which the Chief Planner in any event had no

authority”;3°

the correspondence between the Parties of 1995 and 1996 merely construes a “pattern whereby
the Claimant would send self-serving letters to the Respondent’s public officials” setting out

his demands, requests and wishes, without being encouraged by the Respondent;

there is no documentary support for the allegation that the then Deputy Prime Minister gave

188. Moreover, as noted in Mr. Cummins’ witness statement, management of the Sluice Gate was “a

99320

complicated issue calling for consideration of a multitude of divergent interests,”*°° where efficient

management could only be achieved with “the full cooperation of all the parties involved.”*?!

189. In summary, the Respondent contends that the correspondence between the Parties establishes an

unbridged gap between Mr. Allard’s expectations and reality, as he repeatedly sought, yet failed to
receive, the “kind of assurances and guarantees from the Respondent that he may have hoped would

99322

underwrite his project.

190. With respect to the Claimant’s reliance on the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Ramsar

Convention, the Respondent contends that:
(i) the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to consider alleged breaches of these treaties;

(ii) _ the Tribunal should apply the rule explicitly stated in Article 1105(1) of the NAFTA and in all
of Canada’s recent bilateral investment treaties that a breach of any other treaty does not

amount to a breach of the FET standard;

(iii) Barbados ratified the Ramsar Convention in 2006, long after Mr. Allard made his investment;

and that,

(iv) in any event, Barbados has complied with its obligations under these treaties.*”7

for the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme, which he conducted “reluctantly” and at the behest of

the Respondent.**

(c) The Tribunal’s analysis

192. Inthe Tribunal’s view, the question the Respondent has raised of whether the FET standard contained
in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT constitutes an autonomous treaty standard having its own content or
corresponds to the minimum standard of treatment of aliens under customary international law” is

not material for the outcome of the case.

193. This is because the entire claim under Article II(2)(a) is based on the notion that the FET standard
protects an investor’s legitimate expectations arising from representations made by the host State.
Whether Article II(2)(a) creates an autonomous FET standard or corresponds to the minimum
standard of treatment, in each case it includes the protection of an investor’s legitimate expectations

arising from a host State’s representations, under certain conditions.

194. Assuming that Mr. Allard’s construction of Article II(2)(a) is correct, three factual cumulative
conditions present themselves: (i) was there a specific representation?; (ii) did the investor rely on it,
ie., was it critical to his making of the investment?; and (iii) was the investor’s reliance reasonable?
The Tribunal examines the first two of these three questions below; as will be seen, in this case there

is no need to examine the third.
(i) | Whether Barbados made any specific representations
195. The representations of Barbados relied upon by the Claimant fall into the two broad categories of:

(1) _ representations by which Barbados allegedly undertook to generally protect the environment

at the Sanctuary; and

(2) _ representations by which Barbados allegedly undertook to manage the Sluice Gate.

196. As to (1), rep i egarding general envii I pr ion: The Claimant’s claims are

based on representations made by Barbados purportedly giving rise to reasonable expectations that
Barbados would “uphold its environmental policies, particularly those that reflected a commitment

to conservation and protection of the biodiversity of the Sanctuary.”**° In particular, Mr. Allard

Peter A. Allard v. Barbados

asserts that he reasonably expected that the Respondent would not eliminate the “buffer zone”

existing under the 1986 Plan.**!

197. The Claimant invokes the specific and direct representations of Barbados on which he bases these

expectations as comprising:
(i) the 1986 Plan;
(ii) the 1995 Cummins Letter;

(iii) a series of events that occurred in 1996, i.e., a reply letter from the Barbados Ministry of
Finance and Economic Affairs and the then Deputy Prime Minister’s statements during a
meeting;

(iv) the First and Second ARA Reports of 1997 and 1998; and

(v) a letter from the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Physical Development of 2002.37

198. The Claimant adds that Barbados’ environmental treaty obligations confirmed and reinforced the

specific representations made by Barbados to Mr. Allard.*°

199. On this issue, the Tribunal concludes to the contrary. On a fair reading, none of the statements relied

upon by the Claimant are amenable to characterisation as a specific representation capable of creating
a legitimate expectation on the part of Mr. Allard that Barbados would take any specific steps with
regard to the environmental protection of the Sanctuary. The terms and context of these statements
do not suffice to support the expression of an intention to create an obligation for the State. Nor is

each reasonably amenable to be interpreted by an investor to create such an obligation.

200. Plainly, the 1986 Plan was a general expression of Barbados’ policy with respect to the patterning of

land use and physical development on the island, including an “intention to protect areas of special
vegetation including . .. Graeme Hall [Swamp].”*™ It “designate[d] Graeme Hall Swamp as an area
for major recreational activity and/or open space,”** but did not express any position that Barbados’
general policy of protection of areas of special vegetation would always be achieved through this
designation. The 1986 Plan, in itself, was insufficiently specific to give rise to any legitimate

expectation that its land designation would not be amended. As a matter of general approach, such

planning regulations of an administrative nature are not shielded from subsequent changes under
domestic law.**° But the critical point is that the Claimant is unable to point to any other specific
statement by Barbados to the effect that the 1986 Plan would not be amended at all or in its part
material to the environmental protection of Graeme Hall Swamp.**”’ The 1986 Plan was brought to
the attention of the Claimant by the 1995 Cummins Letter for information purposes only, without

containing any commitments.***

201. The 1995 Cummins Letter was itself merely a reply by the Chief Town Planner to a proposed plan
for the Sanctuary project, in which Mr. Allard requested Barbados’ assurance that it would grant him
certain permits, tax breaks, land leases and the lease of the Sluice Gate, allowing him to open it
“twice daily.”3*? Mr. Allard asked Barbados to give its “general agreement to cooperate with correct
ecological management of interconnecting waterways and lands between Graeme Hall and
Government lands.”*“° In response, Mr. Cummins made it clear that he could not address at that stage
the Claimant’s specific investment plan, as it was “difficult to comment on the proposal as
submitted.”*! Most certainly, he did not give any of the assurances requested by the Claimant.
Rather, he clearly stated that his purpose was “to highlight the environmental importance of the

Graeme Hall Swamp.” *?

202. Additionally, the 1995 Cummins Letter informed the Claimant that “the proposed development

require[d] formal planning permission” and that “a formal application to the Planning Office [was]
required along with a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment highlighting the assets of
the development, areas of concern, the issues to be addressed and an environmental management

plan for the wetland.”>4

203. A similar statement was made in the letter dated 8 August 1996 from the Ministry of Finance and

Economic Affairs replying to the same proposal. The Ministry stated that “the Minister of Finance
and Economic Affairs has deferred making a decision in respect of the proposed Graeme Hall Bird
Sanctuary until a now imminent Environmental Impact Assessment has been completed.”*“> Thus,
the 1995 Cummins Letter and the 1996 letter from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs
both served to highlight Mr. Allard’s, as opposed to Barbados’, obligations regarding the

environmental aspects of the planned investment.

204. With regard to the “emphatic assurance” by the former Deputy Prime Minister of Foreign Affairs

and Tourism during a meeting in November 1996, even if it is accepted as having been given based
solely on a letter written by the Claimant himself, it is insufficiently specific to give rise to legitimate

expectations with regard to environmental protection of the Sanctuary.*“

205. Further, neither the First nor Second ARA Reports could be reasonably understood by the Claimant

as giving rise to obligations on the part of Barbados. They were produced by “a firm of consultants”

recommendations for, appropriate arrangement for operating a proposed Reserve at Graeme Hall as

a tourism attraction.”*’ The study’s only relevance to the Claimant’s project was that the

Award

“Government w[ould] be better able to make informed decisions regarding requested concessions for

developments at Graeme Hall.”™“*

External consultants charged with producing a recommendation for the State are not an organ of the
State as an entity exercising elements of governmental authority. Accordingly, any representations
made in the First and Second ARA Reports cannot be attributed to Barbados. Nor did Barbados
represent to Mr. Allard that it would follow the recommendations set out in these reports: it simply
informed to “whom it may concern” that “the Ministry of Tourism [contracted] the services of [ARA]

1349

to carry out a feasibility study.

Likewise, any statement made by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Physical Development
and Environment in his letter dated 22 March 2003, cannot be perceived as a specific representation
attributable to the Government of Barbados. The Permanent Secretary unequivocally stated that the
letter’s subject fell “outside [his] immediate remit,” and that, therefore, “any remarks [he] offer[ed]
must simply be construed as general observations.” He never induced the Claimant to believe that he

was acting on behalf of Barbados, and clarified that all statements were based on “[his] own view.”?°°

Having found no direct and specific representation capable of giving rise to legitimate expectations
on the part of Mr. Allard regarding the environmental protection of the Sanctuary generally, the
Tribunal need not address the question of whether Barbados’ international obligations arising from

its environmental treaties confirmed or reinforced the legitimacy of the Claimant’s expectations.

Representations regarding the Sluice Gate: Without regard to whether the Sluice Gate was the causa
causans of the salinity problem (if there was one), the claim is that Barbados made specific and direct
representations that it undertook to manage the Sluice Gate. As discussed above, the Claimant’s
complaint is that Barbados then failed to adequately maintain and operate the Sluice Gate to allow
ingress and egress of water from and to the sea, failing in particular to operate the Sluice Gate in a

way that would allow contaminants to be flushed from and seawater to enter the Sanctuary.

The fact that the Sluice Gate is located on land that is the property of the State at the end of a canal

leading from the Sanctuary,**' suffices for the Tribunal to infer that maintenance and operation is the

responsibility of the State. The question with respect to the application of the FET standard, however,
is whether Mr. Allard had a legitimate expectation that Barbados would operate the Sluice Gate in

any particular way, for example to facilitate the flushing of fresh water or the ingress of seawater.

According to the Claimant, Barbados committed to manage the Sluice Gate by its approval of the

Amended EMP, which stated that:

(i) “the Government of Barbados would retain ultimate responsibility for sluice gate
management”;
(ii) “[t]he need for a comprehensive drainage plan” was “in most respects, . . . fulfilled by [the

1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study];” and that

(iii) “it is clearly governments [sic] responsibility to undertake the work outlined in the drainage

99352,

report.

Barbados appears to have approved the Amended EMP in its entirety, including in its part concerning
the drainage plan. By letter of 12 September 2000, the Chief Town Planner granted a conditional
approval of the Amended EMP, subject to “the approval of the drainage and storm water management

+353

plan” by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport.*”’ At that time, the Claimant was fully aware

that the “matters relating to drainage and engineering works [were] the only outstanding issue”?
and that he needed to undertake a series of further steps pursuant to comments made by the Ministry
of Public Works and Transport on 27 November 2000.** By letter dated 19 March 2001, the
Claimant reported to the Chief Town Planner that he had “adequately fulfilled the obligations for
planning permission that related to drainage and storm water management.”**° The Chief Town
Planner did not reply to this letter or in any other way inform the Claimant that permission to his
project was not granted. Nor did the Town & Country Development Planning Office send Mr. Allard

a warning notice once he started building on the Sanctuary grounds as it had previously done when

(examination of Mr. Ryan Chenery); Hearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 565:23-566:15 (examination of Mr. Mark
Cummins).

Mr. Allard had started construction works without prior approval.**’ Not having objected at any time
since, the Respondent cannot now contend that the planning permission was not granted to the

Claimant’s project.

213. However, in the Tribunal’s view, the approval of the Amended EMP cannot be assimilated to an
affirmative representation by Barbados that it would operate the Sluice Gate in accordance with the
Amended EMP’s proposals or in a way to protect the interests of Mr. Allard in the management of

the Sanctuary.

214. The submission of an environmental management plan for the Sanctuary was a condition imposed
on the Claimant by Barbados for receiving a planning and development permit. It was part of the
Barbadian environmental assessment process. The Claimant admits that drainage-related issues
“came up during the environmental assessment process,” *** after Barbados requested the Claimant

99359

to submit a “comprehensive drainage plan of the swamp including the sluice gate, as a

requirement for the approval of the EMP.

215. It follows that the approval of the Amended EMP did not amount to an implicit undertaking of the
State to adopt a course of conduct consistent with the terms of the EMP. The approval merely meant
that Barbados deemed the EMP as sufficing for the purposes of the environmental impact assessment
requirement. Barbados’ approval of the Amended EMP, including in its part concerning the drainage
plan, merely entitled the Claimant to expect that he could proceed with his project without objection
from the State on environmental grounds, but did not constitute a representation that the State would

manage the Sluice Gate as proposed in the EMP.

216. The Tribunal concludes that Barbados did not make specific and direct representations giving rise to
any legitimate expectations on the part of Mr. Allard regarding the maintenance and operation of the

Sluice Gate.

(ii) | Whether Mr. Allard relied on any representations of Barbados

217. Reliance by the investor on the host State’s representations is an essential element of a claim of

breach of the FET standard based on the notion of legitimate expectations.

218. The reliance criterion requires that the investor’s decisions to invest be made in reliance on

representations made to him by the State, including both his initial investment decision and also
further investment decisions, such as a decision to inject additional capital into an ongoing project.
In each case, a breach of the FET standard may arise if the State later acts in a manner contrary to its
representations. However, the investor will be able to claim for damage in respect only of the part of

its investment that was made after and in reliance on the State’s representations.

219. Accordingly, the Respondent’s argument that its alleged representations to Mr. Allard were made,

for the most part, after Mr. Allard’s initial decision to invest in the Sanctuary and can therefore not

have been relied upon by him, is not in itself dispositive.

220. Nevertheless, the Tribunal here finds that Mr. Allard did not make either his initial or later investment

decisions in reliance on any representations made by Barbados. He presents as a person of
philanthropic intentions and of enthusiasms. It appears that he took the decision to invest in 1994,
before any of the alleged representations were made, with the exception of the 1986 Plan. In 1994,
he made what may, without criticisms, be described as an impulsive commitment, followed by an
360

offer to buy the first part of the Sanctuary grounds in February 1995.
1996.**! Thereafter, the second and third parcels were purchased in 1998 and 1999.* From 2000 to

He ultimately bought it in

2004, he funded construction at the site in preparation for the Sanctuary’s opening to visitors in 2004.

221. Itis during this period from 1995 to 2004 that all of the alleged representations of Barbados on which

the Claimant now seeks to rely were made. However, in the entirety of the evidence there is no
confirmation that the taking of any of the investment decisions during this period was predicated

upon the receipt by Mr. Allard of any relevant assurances from Barbados.

222. In summary, Mr. Allard appears to have taken the decision to create a bird and nature reserve on the

Sanctuary grounds as early as his first visit to the Sanctuary in the company of Mr. Watson in 1994,

and he moved in the following ten years toward the realization of his project irrespective, and not in

reliance upon, any relevant representations made by Barbados.**

As words more of praise than of
criticism, Mr. Allard appears to have been of visionary disposition in respect of this project.
Unfortunately, when things go wrong, good intentions do not directly translate to establishing a

backstop to shift responsibility under the terms of the BIT to the State.

223. What is determinative here is that Mr. Allard’s investment was conditional neither on any general

expressions of positive environmental policy, such as those found in the 1986 Plan, the 1995
Cummins Letter, and the First and Second ARA Reports, nor on any representations concerning the

management and operation of the Sluice Gate.

224. As to general environmental policy, although Mr. Allard realized that he would only receive

Barbados’ support once his EMP was approved,*™ he nonetheless purchased the first and second
parcels of the Sanctuary, and commenced its development, before even submitting an environmental
management plan for approval, and did so against the advice and warnings of Barbados officials.*°*
The third parcel was acquired after the First EMP had been rejected, but before the submission of the

Amended EMP.

225. As to the management and operation of the Sluice Gate, the main representation on which the

Claimant seeks to rely is Barbados’ overall approval of the Amended EMP in 2001.* Yet, the
Claimant bought all of the Sanctuary land and began the development of the project*” before the
Amended EMP was approved, despite having been of the view that “[c]orrect ecological operation
of [the] sluice gate is a necessity to maintain the right saline content of Graeme Hall,”** as stated in

his initial proposal of 1995.

(iii) Conclusion

226. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has failed to establish that:

(1) Barbados made any specific representations to the Claimant; and that

(2) the Claimant relied on any such representations in acquiring and developing the Sanctuary.

227. As the Claimant did not rely, the question of whether reliance was reasonable is moot.

228. Consequently, the Tribunal cannot find a violation of Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.

S

2. FPS

9. Article II(2) of the BIT relevantly provides:

2. Each Contracting Party shall accord investments or returns of investors of the other
Contracting Party: [. . .]

(b) full protection and security [. . .]

(a) The Claimant’s position

230. The Claimant contends that the FPS standard obligates the host State to act with due diligence to

369

370

“protect investments against injury by private parties,”*°°

requiring “nothing more nor less than the
reasonable measures of prevention which a well-administered government could be expected to
exercise,” without “any need to establish malice or negligence,”*”” and that here, Barbados’
obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Ramsar Convention heighten the
level of diligence required.*”! Further, the Claimant argues that in determining whether a State has

exercised due diligence, it is relevant to consider whether:
(i) the facts at issue were known to the host State;
(ii) the host State conducted investigations in response to complaints by the investor; and

(iii) the host State took adequate steps to apprehend a wrongdoer or otherwise enforce a penalty.*””

231. On reference to the historical development of the FPS standard,*” jurisprudence of the International

Court of Justice*” and other investment awards,*” the Claimant submits that the FPS standard is not
limited to protection against “physical interference with property, let alone . . . physical violence”*”°
and, that in any event, the claim here is one of physical interference with property through the
unlawful trespass of pollutants.*”’ The Trail Smelter decision is invoked to establish that damage to

private property caused by pollution is an actionable injury under customary international law.”

232. Applying these principles to the claims, the Claimant argues that Barbados denied FPS to
Mr. Allard’s investment by failing to take reasonable care to protect the Sanctuary, despite being put
on notice of the environmental damage to the Sanctuary and notwithstanding Mr. Allard’s repeated
offers of financial and technical assistance. Specifically, Barbados failed to adequately manage the

Sluice Gate and enforce its environmental laws, such as the Marine Pollution Control Act3”

233. The Claimant asserts that his letters to Barbados**? and Barbados’ own internal documents*!

establish that Barbados was aware both of the risks arising from mismanagement of the Sluice Gate
and the environmental degradation of the Sanctuary. The Claimant highlights his repeated offers to
assist Barbados with the prevention and remediation of environmental damage to the Sanctuary and
particularly with the repair of the Sluice Gate, including that he sponsored a three-day trip for
Government officials to meet with specialists in Florida and provided $5,000 to the CZMU for

hydrology testing and monitoring equipment.**?

234. In particular, the Claimant contends that Barbados could and should have taken the following

“reasonable measures”:

(i) repairing the Sluice Gate and establishing a regular schedule for water exchange between the

Sanctuary and the sea;

(ii) reconfiguring government-owned ditches so that stormwater could be directed to the sea

through the Sluice Gate;

(iii) allowing contaminated stormwater to flow to the Barbados South Coast Sewage Plant and be

pumped out to sea in off-peak hours;
(iv) notifying the Sanctuary when a failure occurred at the sewage plant;
(v) using adjacent lands to intercept and treat stormwater in retention basins; and

(vi) prohibiting adjacent commercial properties from discharging wastewaters.**

(b) The Respondent’s position

235. The Respondent submits that the FPS standard is limited to “protection against direct physical harm

to an investor or its property by a State, its agents or as the result of the State’s gross negligence in

protecting the investment against physical harm,”***

and does not impose “liability on the host State
for alleged violations by third parties of domestic environmental legislation.”**° To the extent that
the FPS standard obligates the State to exercise due diligence, it is in “providing protection and
security”; there is no autonomous “due diligence” requirement that applies to the entirety of the host

State’s conduct.**°

236. The FPS standard under the BIT merely reflects customary international law**’ and the Claimant’s

citations do not establish consistent State practice and opinio juris to a higher obligation.*** The
arbitral awards cited by the Claimant are irrelevant to establishing the content of customary
international law as they interpret specific clauses of particular treaties.**° Some of the cases involve

3° and the few cases that have

direct physical interference with the investment by the host State,
interpreted the FPS standard “to cover more than physical harm” are “controversial.”*”' The finding
in the Trail Smelter case that “no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a
manner as to cause injury” also is irrelevant, as it was made in the context of an inter-State dispute

and was a “manifestation of the concepts of national sovereignty and non-interference.”

239. In essence, the Claimant complains that Barbados breached the FPS standard by failing to:
(i) repair and regularly operate the Sluice Gate;

(ii) take the other specific steps listed at paragraph 234 above to reduce the run-off of contaminants

into the Sanctuary; and
(iii) enforce the Marine Pollution Control Act.
240. In substance, the Parties agree that none of these actions were taken by Barbados.

241. With regard to the first two complaints, it may be accepted that the record supports the Claimant’s
contention that Barbados was aware of the potential environmental importance of the Sluice Gate
and the possible presence of contaminants in both the natural run-off to the Sanctuary and in any

emergency discharge from the Barbados South Coast Sewage Plant.*°°

effect on the Sanctuary’s water quality (Exhibits C-68 to C-70, Letters from Roger Sweeney to the Chief Town

242. The Tribunal further finds, however, that, being aware of the environmental sensitivities of the

Sanctuary, Barbados took reasonable steps to protect it.

243. It is accepted by the Claimant that the obligation of the State to provide the investment with FPS is
not one of strict liability, but of “due diligence” or “reasonable care.”“” Relevantly, and as noted in

El Paso v. Argentina:

[. . .] the obligation to show “due diligence” does not mean that the State has to prevent each
and every injury. Rather, the obligation is generally understood as requiring that the State take
reasonable actions within its power to avoid injury when it is, or should be, aware that there is a
risk of injury. The precise degree of care, of what is “reasonable or “due”, depends in part on the
circumstances.“

244. The obligation is limited to reasonable action, and a host State is not required to take any specific
steps that an investor asks of it. The fact that Barbados is a party to the Convention on Biological
Diversity and the Ramsar Convention does not change the standard under the BIT, although
consideration of a host State’s international obligations may well be relevant in the application of the

standard to particular circumstances.

245. Here, it is established that Barbadian officials implemented procedures to prevent environmental
damage to the Sanctuary both on their own initiative and in response to the Claimant’s complaints.”
In particular, Barbados established the Graeme Hall Stewardship Committee (“Committee”) in

2003, in order “to investigate and coordinate government action at Graeme Hall [Swamp] in an

Planner, the CZMU and the Chief Environmental Engineer dated 24 and 25 October 2000; Exhibit C-71, Letter

247. As noted in paragraph 153 above, the Sluice Gate was close to inoperable during the entire Relevant
Period. However, the issues concerning repair and operation of the Sluice Gate and the passing of
water between the Sanctuary and the sea are not the simple matters the Claimant suggests they are.
There is a wider group of stakeholders, and the Tribunal accepts the explanations made by Dr. Inniss
that “there needed to be a wider solution besides just the gate, [that a] major hydrogeological
study ... was needed to understand how the hydrology in the swamp should be optimized and the

structures that should be put in place in order to give effect to that optimization.” Thus, the coastal

geomorphology of the beach needed to be assessed to understand what type of repair was required.*?5
The only known options for upgrading the Sluice Gate during the Relevant Period were those
proposed in the 1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study.*”° However, by 2006, the situation on
the ground had changed, the width of the beach having increased significantly,*?’ which limited both
tidal and groundwater exchange.’”* As explained by Dr. Inniss:

[. . .] what was urgently needed before [the] Government invested in a new gate was that

hydrogeological study that would then tell us whether we needed a series of gates or a series of

weirs or whether we needed to change the elevation of certain sections of the swamp so that

hydrology within the wetland would be optimized. We felt that that was much more urgent than
anew sluice gate.”

248. The Sluice Gate’s operation would affect the Sanctuary, the surrounding lands, including government

lands, as well as the public beach. The interaction between the Sanctuary and the sea through the
Sluice Gate raised two major concerns. First, the wastewater discharged from the Sluice Gate onto
the beach necessarily would have a negative impact on the near-shore sea grass, coral reefs and water

430

quality,*° and affect the availability of adjacent tourist and public uses of the sea and its beaches.
Second, operation of the Sluice Gate in a way that would allow seawater to enter the Sanctuary
(assuming this is possible) may entail the risk of flooding of the adjacent properties.**! It was
therefore no easy issue to establish the hydrology of the whole area and to administer it in the interests

of all the stakeholders.

249. Under these circumstances, Barbados’ approach in addressing the Sluice Gate and general pollution

425

issues at the Sanctuary as part of its governance of the entire area does not fall short of what was
appropriate and sufficient for purposes of the duty of due diligence required by Article II(2)(b) of
the BIT.

Peter A. Allard v. Barbados
Award

Standing back from the detail of the Claimant’s retrospective analysis of the situation of the Sluice
Gate during the Relevant Period, it is quite implausible for the Claimant to attribute responsibility
for the egress or ingress of Sanctuary waters to the actions or inactions with respect to the operation

of the Sluice Gate.

The Tribunal is also not satisfied that Barbados breached the FPS standard in any respect by failing
to enforce the Marine Pollution Control Act. On no view is the claim sufficiently particularized. The
Claimant’s claim is that Section 3 “creates the criminal offence of releasing any pollutant into the
environment in excess of applicable standards” and that Barbados failed to enforce the Act against

282 Yet the Claimant has not even

“any of the sources of contamination of the Sanctuary’s waters.
attempted to identify which sources of pollution that allegedly contaminated the Sanctuary’s waters
were also prosecutable offences under the Act. Additionally, the Claimant appears not to have

informed Barbados of the need for the enforcement of the Act at any time before this arbitration.

In summary, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent’s submission that the Claimant has failed to
establish that Barbados violated its obligations of the FPS standard. Even accepting the Claimant’s
articulation of the FPS standard as including an obligation of the host State to protect foreign
investments against environmental damage, and assuming (quod non) that environmental damage
was proven in the present case, the Tribunal finds that no violation of the FPS standard arising under

Article II(2)(b) of the BIT is established.

3. Expropriation
Article VIII of the BIT relevantly provides:

Investments or returns of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalized,
expropriated or subjected to measures having an effect equivalent to nationalization or
expropriation (hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”) in the territory of the other Contracting
Party, except for a public purpose, under due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and
against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. [. . .]

(a) The Claimant’s position

The claim is that the Respondent has applied “measures having an effect equivalent to .. .

expropriation.”“*3 Such indirect expropriation occurs where a “measure substantially deprives the

452 Statement of Claim, ff 122, 139.

433 Statement of Claim, {| 105.

75

Peter A. Allard v. Barbados
Award

owner of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of the property.”***

255. The claim is described as a “classic ‘Catch-22’ position.”**> On the one hand, by designating Graeme

Hall Swamp as a “wetland of international importance” under the Ramsar Convention and the
Sanctuary as a “natural heritage site” under the 2003 Plan, Barbados restricted Mr. Allard from
putting the Sanctuary to “any use other than as a conservation project.”“* On the other hand, by
failing to responsibly operate the Sluice Gate, maintain the zoning designations of the 1986 Plan or
take any action to enforce the Marine Pollution Control Act, Barbados allowed the environmental

degradation of the Sanctuary, making it impossible to operate it as an eco-tourism attraction.**”

256. In reply to the Respondent’s contention that the Claimant retains ownership and occupation and

continues to use the Sanctuary for commercial operations, the Claimant explains that “[w]hat’s been
expropriated . . . is not the land . . . or the ability to continue operating a café,” but “the ability to

carry on an eco-tourism business.” #8

(b) The Respondent’s position

257. The exacting nature of the requirement of “substantial deprivation” for a showing of indirect

434

435

436

437

438

439

440

441

expropriation,*” requires “interference with use of property which has the effect of depriving the
owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably to be expected economic benefit of
property,” to the extent that the investor is “radically deprived of the economic use and enjoyment

of its investments, as if the rights related thereto . . . had ceased to exist.”“4!

Peter A. Allard v. Barbados
Award

258. Not all measures that make it “uneconomical to continue a particular business” amount to an

expropriation.”

259. Here, the Claimant has not demonstrated a substantial deprivation as he remains in full exclusive
possession and control of the Sanctuary. Further, the Sanctuary has not suffered environmental
damage, whether occasioned by the Respondent or otherwise.“ It attracted substantial numbers of
visitors until it closed in 2009** and, since then, the Claimant has elected to continue such
commercial operations on the site as a café and also renting it for wedding celebrations and other

social activities.“

260. Moreover, the environmental conditions of which the Claimant complains were in place when he
acquired the site and “loss” cannot be of something never possessed.*#° In summary, the Respondent
submits that:

Everything in the record of this matter points to the conclusion that the Claimant closed the
[Sanctuary], not because the Respondent had forced its closure through any alleged action or

inaction, but because the Claimant realised that his operation was uneconomic; and also because
the Claimant finally realised that he would have to be responsible for the operation costs.“*”

261. An investor’s reasonable expectations as to the potential use of his property are relevant to
determining whether there has been an indirect expropriation.“ Here, the Claimant intended to run
the Sanctuary as an eco-tourism attraction.“ His acquisition of parts of the Sanctuary was subject to

specific covenants to the effect that the Sanctuary would not be available for development.*” In this

Award

context, he has no reasonable complaint that the Sanctuary “cannot be put to any use other than as a

conservation project.’”**!

262. It has consistently been held by tribunals that protections against unlawful expropriation do not
restrict the State’s freedom to enact general legislation and take non-discriminatory measures within
the police power of the State.*** The designation of the Sanctuary under the Ramsar Convention and

the 2003 Plan was “fully consistent with sound public policy and was wholly within the police powers

of the Respondent.” Consequently, such designation does not amount to an indirect expropriation."

(c) The Tribunal’s analysis

263. As acknowledged by both Parties, and as is accepted by the Tribunal, the first requirement for a
successful claim of indirect expropriation is that, as a result of measures taken by the host State, the
investor have suffered a substantial deprivation of the use or expected economic benefit of the
investment, such that the investor must establish that the effect of the measures taken by the host

State resembles the effect of a direct expropriation.

264. On any view, here it is not established that there has been any such deprivation. Mr. Allard remains
the owner of the Sanctuary grounds, on which he continues to operate a café, and acknowledged at
the Hearing that “there is some kind of business remaining there.”*** It is therefore undisputed that

the Claimant has not been deprived of his entire investment in Barbados.

265. The argument here is that what has been expropriated is neither the land nor the café, but his ability
to run an eco-tourism business. This appears to imply that it is the anticipated returns of an eco-
tourism business that constituted the expected economic benefit of the investment. However, even if
the Tribunal were to accept that the destruction of the Claimant’s ability to run an eco-tourism
business on the Sanctuary grounds could constitute an indirect expropriation under Article VIII of

the BIT, the Tribunal’s conclusion on the facts that the Claimant has failed to establish that his

decision to cease operating the Sanctuary was due to any degradation of the environment at the

Sanctuary forecloses the expropriation claim.

For these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s claim under Article VIII of the BIT.

JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS

Deferred temporal objection. As noted in paragraph 16 above, in its Award on Jurisdiction, the
Tribunal deferred to the merits phase of this arbitration the Respondent’s Jurisdictional Objection
pertaining to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis over the Claimant’s claims arising from the

alleged mismanagement of the Sluice Gate.**°

Article XIII(3) of the BIT provides for a three-year limitation period on arbitration claims:

An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with
paragraph (4) only if:

[...] @) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired,
or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor
has incurred loss or damage.

  

As the Claimant commenced these proceedings on 21 May 2010, pursuant to Article XIII(3) the
Tribunal has no jurisdiction over claims arising from alleged breaches and consequent loss or damage
of which the Claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge before 21 May 2007.
On this basis, the Parties disagree as to whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimant’s
claims arising from the alleged mismanagement of the Sluice Gate. Their positions on this question

were summarized in the Award on Jurisdiction.*°°

As noted, the Tribunal deferred consideration of this question to the present phase of the proceedings
“as impleading issues intertwined with those that will arise for determination under the merits
phase,” where the Tribunal’s determination is that the Claimant has failed both to establish that
Barbados breached the BIT by mismanaging the Sluice Gate and that Mr. Allard incurred any loss
or damage as a result of mismanagement of the Sluice Gate. This renders moot the question of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis over the Claimant’s claims arising from such alleged
mismanagement. Conceptually time, even on an imputed basis, cannot be said to be capable of

running from a non-event.

the Hearing that Mr. Allard’s further answers under cross-examination had given rise to “two new

jurisdictional issues.” **

First, the Respondent invoked Mr. Allard’s admissions under examination concerning his motivation
to buy the Sanctuary to invite the Tribunal to revisit its decision at the Jurisdictional Objections phase
as to whether Mr. Allard was an investor under the BIT.* Specifically, Mr. Allard gave the

following answers to questions from the Respondent’s counsel:

Q. If you had managed to sign those contracts with the cruise ships and tour operators, and
because of that, if you made your Business Plan, you made your budget, you reached your goal,
the site became self-sustaining, and made a modest profit, but the sluice gate wasn’t operated the
way you wanted, would you have closed the Sanctuary?

Mr. Allard: I believe so, yes.
Q. Is that what a businessman does?
Mr. Allard: When you have no control over your—the environment that’s polluting you, yes.

Q. So, a businessman, who makes his Business Plan, achieves his objectives and makes a modest
profit that was his entire Business Plan, would nonetheless close his operations?

Mr. Allard: Yeah, for sure.“

In his rebuttal closing statement, the Claimant’s counsel contended that Mr. Allard’s answers only
confirm that, as found by the Tribunal in the Award on Jurisdiction, he “had a combination of motives
that included environmental conservation,” and hence to raise this issue as a new ground on closing

arguments does not justify reopening the Award on Jurisdiction.**!

In its Award on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that “expectations of an eventual profit were honestly
held by Mr. Allard when establishing the Sanctuary in 1996 and thereafter, notwithstanding that
during the Sanctuary’s establishment and operations factors of profit were considered secondary and
in the background to his principal motivations of environmental and public purposes.”* Within their

context, Mr. Allard’s elaborations as to his motivations do not impugn the basis of the prior findings

where the Claimant was successful, if only just, on this issue of characterisation of his expenditures

as an investment.

275. Inany event, were the Tribunal of the contrary opinion, considerations of issue estoppel, or even res

judicata, might have arisen. This possibility also falls into the ‘unnecessary to decide’ category.

276. The second additional jurisdictional issue raised by the Respondent is that Mr. Allard admitted that

his claims are for future harm, while actual loss or damage are requirements for the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction under Article XIII(1) of the BIT.“

277. The Respondent’s last submission raises the question of whether injury is a jurisdictional requirement

of the BIT. It was not otherwise discussed in this arbitration, is not based on any new fact or
circumstance and could, and therefore should, have been made during the jurisdictional phase of
these proceedings. The fact that other findings made in this Award dispose of all the Claimant’s

claims suffices to make it otiose to admit this ground for consideration.

VI. COSTS

RELEVANT PROVISIONS

278. Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that “[t]he arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of

463

arbitration in its award” and defines such costs as follows:
The term “costs” includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed
by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;

(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(c) The costs of expert advice and of other stance required by the arbitral tribunal;

 

(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the
arbitral tribunal;

 

(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were
claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal
determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the Secretary-
General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.

Peter A. Allard v. Barbados
Award

Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides for the allocation of the costs of arbitration:

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by
the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs
between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account
the circumstances of the case.

 

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38,
paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall
be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs
between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.

 

CosTS OF ARBITRATION (OTHER THAN THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE PARTIES)

The Parties deposited with the PCA a total of $1,200,000 ($600,000 each) to cover the costs of the
arbitration set out in Article 38(a), (b) and (c) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The costs disbursed by the

PCA from that deposit break down as follows: **

 

 

 

 

 

TRIBUNAL $835.107
Dr. Gavan Griffith QC $471,277
Expens $18,297
Fees: $452,980

PCA $189,795
Expens $8,995
Fees: $180,800
OTHER EXPENSES (including court reporters, hearing $109,421
facilities, banking costs)

TOTAL $1,134,323

Accordingly, the costs of the arbitration set out in Article 38(a), (b) and (c) of the UNCITRAL Rules
amount to $1,134,323. This leaves an unexpended balance of $65,677 to be returned to the Parties

by the PCA in equal shares.

No costs were incurred under Article 38(f), as neither the services of an appointing authority nor the

services of the Secretary-General of the PCA were required.

stand dismissed.

D. FIXING AND ALLOCATION OF COSTS

1. The Claimant’s position

285. The Claimant submits that, in the exercise of its discretionary power to award costs under

Article 40,*° the Tribunal should examine the “‘success’ of a party on an issue by issue basis rather

83

Peter A. Allard v. Barbados
Award

than by looking at only the final result.” “ In particular, the Claimant’s success with respect to the
Jurisdictional Objections, fraud allegations and procedural issues raised by the Respondent “should

be weighed together with the final outcome on the merits in any final costs award.” “7
286. Specifically, the Claimant relies on the following “factors”:

(i) the Claimant’s “victory during the lengthy and complex jurisdictional phase of the

468.

arbitration,”°* which caused the one year delay of the merits phase and the Claimant to incur

substantial costs;

(ii) the Respondent’s “unfounded accusations of fraud . . . during the jurisdictional phase,”*”

1 472

which according to State practice*’! and investor-State arbitration tribunals,‘ constitute
procedural conduct to be sanctioned by depriving the Respondent of any award of costs that it

might otherwise obtain; and 47>

(iii) the Claimant’s “overwhelming success” on procedural issues relating to confidentiality and
document production during the merits phase,‘ for which the Claimant incurred “additional

and unnecessary expense.” 47>

287. According to the Claimant, “each of these three factors justifies denying the Respondent any costs
and ordering each party to bear its own share of both the costs of arbitration and the costs of legal

representation.” *7°

288. Additionally, the Claimant challenges the Respondent’s incurred costs of defense as “unreasonable

2477 478,

and grossly disproportionate to the amount in dispute” *”’ and for “lack of specificity,”*”* as evidenced

by:

(i) the disproportion between the total amount of costs claimed by the Respondent ($5,850,857)
and the amount in dispute (approximately $11.3 m. plus interest),“”” when the median costs
incurred by respondents is approximately $2.28 m. for cases in which the amount claimed is

$491 m.:8°

(ii) _ the disparity between the Respondent’s legal fees ($5,199,894) and the Claimant’s legal fees
($936,883), when it is generally acknowledged that claimants incur greater costs in investment

arbitration; **! and

(iii) _ the absence of any justification for the engagement of some sixteen lawyers,**? the role of each

3

lawyer,*** and the number of hours and costs spent on unsuccessful jurisdictional and

procedural issues.***

289. These circumstances suffice for there to be no award of costs to the Respondent where (as has

The Respondent’s position

290. The Respondent submits that the “‘loser pays’ principle” embraced by Article 40 of the UNCITRAL

291.

Rules requires the Tribunal to identify Barbados as the successful party “of the case as a whole,

>486

and that the Claimant “should be ordered to cover the entirety of the costs incurred by the

Respondent,

487 including its costs of legal representation and assistance.***

According to the Respondent, there are no compelling circumstances in this case that would require

the Tribunal to depart from the “‘loser pays’ principle.” “* In particular, the Respondent argues that:

@

(ii)

(iii)

there was no “victory” for the Claimant on the Jurisdictional Objections phase, as “the very

essence of the Claimant’s case” was reserved for determination in the merits phase;*”°

neither at the jurisdictional phase nor at the merits phase has the Claimant discharged his

burden of proof in relation to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction; 4°!

the Respondent’s procedural conduct during the jurisdictional phase was “perfectly legitimate,
objectively justifiable and, in light of the fundamental shortcomings in the Claimant’s

evidence, necessary”;

the Claimant’s intention to conduct a “trial by press release” forced the Respondent to expend
significant resources” and had the potential to “threaten the procedural integrity of the

44,

proceedings, and therefore, the Claimant’s reliance on the Tribunal’s decision on

confidentiality must be dismissed;**> and

the procedural issues relating to document production only serve to establish that the

Claimant’s case is “frivolous and speculative.” °°

Respondent’s Reply on C

Peter A. Allard v. Barbados
Award

Overall, the Respondent argues that it was its duty “as sovereign State” “°’ to challenge “the
Claimant’s case as pleaded” ** as well as “to bring to the Tribunal’s attention the manifest flaws in
the Claimant’s case.’”“*” Thus, if the Claimant’s case is dismissed, whether on jurisdiction or on the

merits, the Claimant should bear all of Respondent’s costs.5”

In addition, the Respondent identifies further grounds that justify an award of costs in its favour,
including:

(i) _ the Claimant’s “shifting argumentation” throughout this arbitration;”’

(ii) the Claimant’s “out-of-turn surrejoinder” submitted prior to the hearing on jurisdiction and the

502

merits;°’ and

(iii) the excessive number of witness statements and expert reports submitted by the Claimant.**

Finally, it is the Respondent’s position that its legal costs are reasonable and comparable to amounts

spent by other respondents in investor-State arbitration proceedings.*™

3. The Tribunal’s analysis

In exercising the discretion accorded it by Articles 38 and 40 the UNCITRAL Rules to fix the costs
of arbitration and apportion them between the Parties, the Tribunal is directed to apply the principle

of reasonableness in light of all the circumstances of the case.

Under the “costs follow the event” principle, a costs order would be made in favour of the
Respondent. The Respondent has, indeed, prevailed on all merits issues, including the many and

diverse factual issues raised for determination, and also the allegations of breach of BIT obligations.

However, different considerations may apply to the disposition of different categories of costs.

Costs of arbitration (other than the costs of the Parties). The Tribunal’s view is that these costs
should follow the ultimate event, and the Respondent’s share of costs advanced be recouped from
the Claimant. As the successful party, the Respondent has been “forced to go through the process in

order to achieve success, and should not be penalised by having to pay for the process itself.”

As noted in paragraphs 280-281 above, the costs of arbitration (other than the costs of the Parties)
amount to $1,134,323, of which the Respondent contributed half ($567,162). Accordingly, the

Claimant should reimburse this amount to the Respondent.

Costs of the Parties’ witnesses and experts. With the exception of the costs arising from the
Respondent’s application for the forensic inspection of evidence submitted by the Claimant, the
Tribunal considers it appropriate for the Claimant to bear the costs arising from the Respondent’s
presentation of witnesses and experts. The Tribunal accepts that these witnesses and experts were

necessary for the Respondent to defend against the Claimant’s claims.

In contrast, the evidence of the forensic experts running to allegation of forgery ended in an impasse,
except to the limited extent that the Parties’ respective forensic experts were able to reach
agreement. The Tribunal finds that the Respondent should bear all costs of forensic experts, in the
amount of $142,819 (including $26,641 for the Claimant’s forensic expert and $116,178 for the

Respondent’s own experts).

Accordingly, the Claimant should reimburse the Respondent $214,238, being claimed costs less
$116,178.

Costs of Jurisdictional Objections. The Tribunal also is of the view that some allowance for costs in
the Respondent’s favour should be made for its costs of the Jurisdictional Objections, in the context
that it accepts it was reasonable for the Respondent to raise the “no investment” issue, where the
Claimant prevailed, “but only just.” Also, the Tribunal accepts that it was reasonable for the
Respondent to raise the limitation objection even though it was held over to the merits phase (see

Section V.C above).

Proportionality Issue. The vast disproportion between the Parties’ professional costs calls for closer

examination.

A State is entitled to full legal service and to incur such legal costs it regards as appropriate for its

defence to a BIT claim. However, it does not follow that by reason of being incurred as part of

mounting a successful defence all such professional costs and expenses fall to be recouped from the

unsuccessful party on an indemnity basis.
The Tribunal is inclined to agree with the statement of the Libananco v. Turkey tribunal that:

A party with a deep pocket may have its own justification for heavy spending, but it cannot

expect to be reimbursed for all its expenditure as a matter of course simply because it is ultimately

the prevailing party. °°”
Here, the Respondent was entitled to defend its interests vigorously, especially within the context of
the Claimant’s raising exhaustively many and all factual issues enlisted to support his dense factual
case. In raising these fact particulars, it became reasonable for the Respondent to mobilize sufficient

resources for refutation.
Of greater moment are the issues of proportionality and disparity.

First, and without analyzing the Claimant’s damages claims, which do not call for determination, the

Respondent’s costs of legal representation are about 20% of the amount in dispute, including interest.

Second is the issue of disparity. The Claimant fielded a lean team of two counsel to carry the
reference. That was his option, and no reason in itself to confine the Respondent to a corresponding
number. For its part, the Respondent engaged six lead counsel, three of whom each had professional
fees equal to the entire professional costs incurred by the Claimant; the total of all six is almost five
times the comparable Claimant’s counsel’s fees. Beyond thi

$665,000.

a further ten lawyers had costs of some

 

The number of counsel and hours for which they have been engaged raise squarely the Libananco
issue, noted in paragraph 306 above, of whether the costs incurred and claimed should fall to be

reimbursed to the prevailing party merely because they have been incurred.

The Tribunal’s approach is not to engage in a superficial assessment as to whether the Respondent’s
costs incurred in its defence were excessive or unreasonable. Rather, the Tribunal is concerned to fix
the proportion of these costs that appear reasonable for the Claimant to be ordered to bear having

regard to all the factors noted above.

Balancing these competing factors, the decision of the Tribunal is to cap the Respondent’s

recoverable professional costs claimed of almost $5.2 m. at $2.25 m.

Other discretionary allowances. Taking account also of the several other allowances which the

Tribunal determines to abate the Claimant’s costs on some issues, and also correspondingly to make

507 Libananco v. Turkey, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award, 2 September 2011, 565.

Award

some allowance in credits referable to some of the Claimant’s costs, the Tribunal also abates from
the addition of the items and amounts stated above to be allowed as costs the further amount of

$250,000.

315. Accordingly the amount of costs ordered to be paid by the Claimant to the Respondent is fixed at

$2,508,144, made up of:

1 Respondent’s witness and expert costs as allowed $214,238

2  Respondent’s other charges and disbursements $320,547

3 Respondent’s professional costs as allowed $2,250,000
Total $2,784,785

LESS $250,000 allowance
LESS $26,641 for Claimant’s forensic expert
TOTAL $2,508,144

316. Conclusion: The Claimant shall reimburse the Respondent an amount of $567,162 as its costs of
arbitration other than costs incurred by the Parties, and an amount of $2,508,144 in respect of costs

incurred by the Parties.
